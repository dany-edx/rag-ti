The company today announced the NSW government had approved its plans to increase the size of its New England battery from the original 200 MW / 400 MWh to a version seven times as large.
The battery will be stationed next to ACEN Australia’s 720 MW (AC) New England Solar Farm. The first 400 MW stage of the solar farm opened in March.

The location of the expanded battery remains within the approved site boundary, with the additional land currently being used as “laydown areas” for stage one construction works, ACEN Australia said. “This area was chosen due to its proximity to the substation where it can connect to the electricity transmission network,” the company added.
ACEN Australia also said its newly-approved modification plans included “some changes” to stage two of the solar project. It said those changes will help “optimise the project, and move it another step towards construction,” though it did not outline any further details.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/31/huge-subsidy-fest-australia-has-the-critical-materials-but-can-it-compete-in-the-manufacturing-race/,"FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 31, 2023","‘Huge subsidy fest’: Australia has the critical materials, but can it compete in the manufacturing race?","Speaking at the Renewables and Critical Minerals Superpower webinar hosted by the Smart Energy Council on Tuesday, Tim Buckley, director of Climate Energy Finance, outlined the fierce competition flooding into the clean energy space, especially around manufacturing. 
In the last year, there has been an onslaught of new clean energy manufacturing plants announced. “Literally 14 months ago, 16 months ago, the IEA [International Energy Agency] said there is only 40% globally of the [solar] module manufacturing capacity needed to deliver on their forecasts; 14 months later, we now have 65% more capacity than the IEA actually models,” Buckley said. 
That is, in terms of solar module manufacturing, the last year has seen the globe move from a massive undersupply to an oversupply.

Much of the focus in Australia to date has rested on the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the US’ deceivingly named renewable energy manufacturing policy. While the IRA is set to bring a five fold increase in clean energy manufacturing to US, the projects it has inspired (and it has inspired a number), pale in comparison to what is happening in China.
“The biggest project announced in America in the last six months is 3 GW. China does 20 or 30 GW per factory. So just to put that in context, 10 times bigger than the biggest announcement in America for solar modules,” Buckley said.
Indeed, the SNEC conference held in Shanghai in May drove home China’s gargantuan capacity to scale up manufacturing – a skill it has finessed over decades. Representatives for pv magazine who attended the conference described the degree of vertical integration and technological diversity within companies as staggering. 
Far from standing by as the IRA diversifies global supply chains away from China, “they are racing even faster,” Buckley said. In its State of Clean Technology Manufacturing report, published in May, the IEA listed the globe’s major project announcements for solar PV and battery manufacturing in the first quarter of 2023. “294 GW of additional solar manufacturing capacity has been announced, and almost all of in China,” Buckley said.

He added that anyone yet to recognise clean energy manufacturing as a race, hasn’t been paying attention.
In that race, China is a decade ahead of Australia, Buckley said.
Australia is one of the few countries in the world with deposits of all the ingredients needed to make the future’s batteries. While it has a clear natural advantage and enjoys favourable terms under the US’ IRA, it is hardly well positioned to move into manufacturing.

One quarter of Australian manufacturing jobs have disappeared since 2006, a new report from Australian climate tech startup, Conry Tech, has found. Entitled Australia’s Dig and Ship Obsession, the report noted mining jobs have doubled in that period. Which is to say, Australia is hardly turning around its global ‘quarry’ status.
Western Australia, unsurprisingly, saw the biggest increase in mining jobs, which grew 153% between 2006 and 2021, adding 40,000 jobs. This figure is set to grow substantially as the state’s mining ramps again to meet global critical minerals needs.

The question is not whether our mined materials are valuable though, but whether Australia will be able to keep more of the value chain onshore by processing, refining and manufacturing products from its raw critical materials.
The Inflation Reduction Act will likely go some ways to realising this, since the policy is all about diversifying the US’ clean energy supply chains. While it is hoping to bring supplies onshore, the US is also looking to ‘friendshore’ – meaning it will source from allies like Australia. 
“As a free tree trade agreement partner, Australia will have special access under the IRA,” Joanna Kay from the Smart Energy Council said.

The extent to which Australia will be seen as a ‘domestic’ supplier under the IRA remains a potential rather than guarantee, however. “That’s very promising, but I wouldn’t be holding my breath for the US taxpayer to send billions of dollars of subsidises for Australia,” Buckley says of Australian favouritism under the IRA.
Australia also recently signed a clean energy compact with the US. The compact outlines bilateral cooperation between the two nations and is seeking to create a framework to coordinate clean energy investments.
“It’s about positioning Australia as a partner of choice for the US,” Kay said. “It means that Australia, under the laws, will have additional tax credits as well,” she added. 

This tax credit system a crucial aspect of the IRA’s design, as Rosie Oldfield, Sundrive’s government relations and corporate affairs manager, explained. “Within the Inflation Reduction Act, there is a particular piece of legislation and policy called the ‘Advanced Manufacturing Reduction Tax Credit.’”
“What this tax credit is, is the linking of tax credits to the production of a product. When you produce a product, for example a solar cell or solar module, what it means for that company is a tax credit goes back to the company, but it also goes back to every single company that had an input element in the supply chain of that product, as long as it happened onshore (in this case, the US). What this means is the tax payer is not on the hook for anything until is produced.”
Oldfield advocated for Australia to set up a similar policy based on this tax credit model.

In terms of how much Australia stands to gain from US policies and compacts, that remains to be seen. Buckley described the Australia US Climate, Critical Minerals and Clean Energy Transformation Compact as “very, very big on aspiration and targets and collaboration.” 
“That’s great, but we do need to see a lot more details,” he added.
Buckley also importantly pointed out that in China, Europe and elsewhere, recycling is being recognised as an another key source of critical materials. In China’s most recent five year plan, the country is targeting a nine-fold increase to its recycling schemes.
“Obviously that is another source of critical mineral supply, so Australia’s got to be nimble, fast, and get onto it while the money is flowing,” Buckley said. 
And flowing it is. Buckley pointed out the IRA is far from the only clean energy manufacturing subsidisation policy in town, with Europe, India, China and elsewhere all introducing their own schemes.
“It’s just a huge huge subsidy fest,” Buckley said.

Indeed, plenty have been built, but it seems the masses have not come. 
The Virtual Power Plant (VPP) adoption rate among battery owners appears to be just 14%, according to research from solar and energy analyst Sunwiz. Head of Renewable Energy Finance at Plenti, Louis Edwards, says VPP operators have simply spent too much time on developing their own programs, and not enough time communicating with those actually selling it.
“It hasn’t worked,” Edwards tells pv magazine Australia, referring to the current landscape in which almost every retailer and battery manufacturer each has their own VPP program, all covering different jurisdictions and all with their own particularities and application processes.
This litany of VPP offers ultimately confuses installers, Edwards says. “When you add additional friction into the sales process for an installer… you disincentive the installer from wanting to sell.”
“Everyone is trying to [create a seamless VPP experience], but we are trying to get installers to sell that on everyone’s behalf.” For that sale to actually happen, installers need to see VPPs as part of a home battery’s inherent value proposition from the start, and have a firm knowledge of what’s on offer.

Finance lender Plenti believes its newly launched GreenConnect platform can fix this VPP bottleneck. The lender has built a platform which consolidates VPPs offers and returns the best results to installers.
That is, the installer inputs their customer’s address and the type of system being configured, including the brands of battery and other equipment, and then the GreenConnect platform displays all the applicable offers in a neat, compelling way – including outlining the customer’s potential savings with each VPP offer, as well as relevant state rebates, Edwards says. 
Once a VPP offer has been selected, the platform then facilitates the application process. “It houses the whole experience,” Edwards says, noting the programs and equipment are then wrapped up into a Plenti finance package. 
The GreenConnect platform launched in March, and has encouraged retailers and manufacturers to provide special offers upon participation. For instance, retailer AGL offers a subsidy of up to $1,500 on top of state government rebates via the platform. 
Amber Electric has offered to waive its monthly subscription fee for the first five months, additional to access to smart battery optimisation and wholesale pricing, including wholesale feed-in tariffs that can reach $15/kWh, Amber Electric has said. These features combined have allowed its customers to benefit from recent price spikes in the wholesale market, earning up to $70 in a day from their solar exports in some cases, the company added.* “We have had considerable interest from the installer market for Amber Electric’s offer which has been an interesting dynamic to observe,” Edwards says.
“We have even more energy retailers, battery manufacturers and now strong interest from EV charging and heat pump manufacturers seeking to join GreenConnect in light of the federal government’s recent budget announcement and the proposed $1 billion [USD 65 million] being allocated to the CEFC for providing concessional or low interest loans for battery and electrification,” Edwards says.
Unifying private market offers and public schemes is perhaps where Edwards sees the most potential for GreenConnect – though it remains to be seen whether governments will feel the same.
Edwards says the platform has been built in an “agnostic fashion” to allow state governments or grid operators to join in their own capacity. For instance, a state government looking to launch a home battery scheme could offer the subsidy through GreenConnect, removing the complexity and cost of the government running the scheme itself.

Plenti has done a case study to this end, examining how private and public could complement one another on the platform, Edwards says. “To my knowledge, there isn’t another platform that has brought together the private market and could potentially facilitate public funding for the purpose of driving battery and electrification products.”
Whether governments will view the lender’s platform as truly “neutral” in the way Edwards describes it, only time will tell. But Plenti is certainly hoping to work with public entities, as it did for the South Australian home battery scheme. 
In Edward’s eyes, installers need to arrive at selling VPPs with batteries as a reflex. To do this will involve educating thousands of individual installers about what VPPs are and how to pitch them. He believes GreenConnect can become “the engine” to enable this.
 “We need to create a critical mass inflection point,” Edwards says. “This is a whole industry problem.”
In FY2023, Plenti funded 11,357 renewable energy systems, including 12% originations with batteries.

Just as Oberlin College students were leaving campus this past week to enjoy their summer recess, a new group was entering campus by farm truck. On May 24, a class of 70 ewes from the Old Slate Farm in Knox County, Ohio, showed up on campus to begin chomping away at weeds, grass and other edible vegetation at the college’s 2.3 MW solar field.
Some 70 Katahdin breed sheep were dropped off on campus at Oberlin last week. There they will graze through mid-June, stomping grass and weeding the solar field in a move aimed at alleviating the need for costly operations and maintenance, according to a report by the school.
Additional sheep drops this summer will bring the total number of grazers at Oberlin’s on-site solar facility to between 150 and 200 heads of sheep.
The sheep will be delivered to the college’s solar field three times per year over the spring, summer, and fall season. A form of agrivoltaics, where land is used for both agriculture and energy generation, the sheep’s handiwork will reduce Oberlin’s emissions from fossil fuel. It is also expected to reduce regular damage to equipment that results from mowing a rough terrain.
Oberlin signed an agreement with Old Slate Farm in April to begin deploying the sheep grazers before summer.

Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have successfully created foldable crystalline silicon (c-Si) wafers, known for their strong light-harvesting capability, for use in flexible silicon heterojunction (HJT) solar cells.
The scientists said HJT cell technology is ideal for making flexible solar cells, as it eliminates edge warping caused by inner stress during the firing process. The wafers were developed with blunting treatment, a technique commonly used to round a wafer’s edges, in order to prevent chipping and cracking during processing. The researchers said that the treatment resulted in a transition of the fracture mechanism from intrinsic brittle cleavage fracture to shear banding with steps and cracks.
The research team used 180 μm Czochralski n-type c-Si wafers, supplied by China-based Sichuan Yongxiang, to create textured wafers with a thickness of 60 μm.
“The wafers were textured in a 2.1-vol% alkali water solution at 80 C for 10 min to form microscale pyramids on the surfaces,” it explained. “All wafers were cleaned using a standard root cause analysis (RCA) process to remove organics and metal ions. Next, they underwent cleaning in 2.0% hydrofluoric acid water solution for 3 min to etch the surface oxide.”
The academics used the wafers to produce two HJT cells with thicknesses of 65 μm and 55 μm. The first cell had a power conversion efficiency of 23.31%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.752 V, a short-circuit current density of 0.09 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 82.40%. The second cell hit an efficiency of 23.35%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.754 V, a short-circuit current density of 0.11 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 82.51%.
The group then applied an anti-reflective coating based on magnesium fluoride (MgF2) on the cells and their efficiency was raised to 24.50%.
“Although this value was lower than that (25.83%) of a thick cell because it was affected by the inferior light-harvesting ability of the thinner wafer, it was a remarkable efficiency compared with that of the current flexible solar cells fabricated from other cost-effective materials,” the scientists said, noting that the use of a 60-μm wafer could reduce production costs by approximately 29%. “Overall, the flexible technology developed in this study reduced the levelised cost of energy by approximately 39% (23%) at the solar cell (module) level.”
The academics presented the new manufacturing process in “Flexible solar cells based on foldable silicon wafers with blunted edges,” which was recently published in Nature. The research group includes scientists from China’s Tongwei (TW), the Changsha University of Science and Technology, Southwest Petroleum University, Soochow University, and Beihang University.
