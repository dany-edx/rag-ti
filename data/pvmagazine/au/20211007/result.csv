https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/07/fortescue-eyes-1-gw-solar-pv-module-manufacturing-plant/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 7, 2021",Fortescue eyes 1 GW solar PV module manufacturing plant,"Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Australian-based iron ore giant Fortescue Metals Group, announced on Thursday it had purchased the majority share in High yield Energy Technologies (HyET) Group, which includes among its assets solar PV module manufacturing firm HyET Solar.
As well as the stake acquisition, FFI had also agreed to provide the majority share of financing for a planned expansion of HyET Solar’s solar PV manufacturing plant in The Netherlands.
The Dutch firm, which manufactures flexible solar modules, has plans to ramp up production capacity of its Powerfoil technology to 900 MW peak by the end of the year.
FFI chief executive officer Julie Shuttleworth said as well as pursuing expansion plans in The Netherlands, Fortescue would also look to establish a solar PV module manufacturing facility in Australia with the lightweight Powerfoil modules suitable for high-volume markets such as utility scale solar farms as well as high-value markets such as building integrated PV.
While no further details about the proposed manufacturing facility were made available, Shuttleworth said the project had already commenced.
“We have commenced the design study for a 1 GW Powerfoil factory in Australia and at this scale, we aim to rapidly drive costs down at a greater rate than is achievable with conventional solar PV technology,” she said.

If established the facility would dwarf the operations of Australia’s only existing solar PV module manufacturer, the South Australian-based Tindo Solar.
Tindo, which is set to commence operations at a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Adelaide’s northern suburbs, has confirmed production capacity at the $11 million plant will be 150 MW per annum.
Shuttleworth said the acquisition of HyET, which also includes HyET Hydrogen among its assets, marks an important milestone in FFI’s vision to produce affordable green hydrogen, with the aim to supply 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen globally by 2030.
“FFI’s goal is to become the world’s leading, fully renewable energy and green products company,” she said.
“The addition of HyET Solar and HyET Hydrogen to our portfolio of FFI companies builds on our commitment to develop technologies needed to tackle emissions and global warming.”
FFI founder and Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest has previously announced ambitious plans to build one of the biggest renewable energy portfolios in the world, delivering more than 235 GW of renewable capacity,
“We are building a portfolio of renewable assets, energy-producing assets around the world,” he said.
Forrest said the HyET acquisition would help fast-track FFI’s wider ambitions to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030.
“Green energies need to be available at an industrial, global scale. We don’t have time to wait, we have to act now,” he said.
“The technologies of the HyET companies will help us reach that tipping point and the world will begin the journey in earnest to become zero-carbon.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/07/doping-delivers-improved-performance-for-perovskite-solar-cells/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 7, 2021",Doping delivers improved performance for perovskite solar cells,"Researchers at The University of Queensland (UQ) have declared advances in nanomaterial technology have allowed them to manufacture perovskite-based solar cells that are as efficient as conventional silicon-based cells, but without the high costs and complex manufacturing processes.
While silicon-based solar cells continue to dominate the market, perovskite solar cells have attracted enormous attention because of their high-efficiency potential and low-cost production but the technology still has some drawbacks including poor long-term stability.
The UQ research team, based at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, have used titanium carbide nanosheets doped with cesium (Cs) to fabricate perovskite solar cells which they claim deliver a PV efficiency of up to 21.57% with “excellent thermal stability”.
“Our theoretical and experimental analysis reveal that cesium plays an important role in improving perovskite crystallization and thus leads to enlarged crystal grains, long-lived carrier lifetimes, and reduced charge recombination,” the academics said.
Research team leader Professor Joe Shapter said the results, published in the journal Cell Reports Physical Science, show that the efficiency and thermal stability of the doped cells significantly outperformed those that were not doped.
“The PSCs that had doped cells showed a remarkable solar conversion efficiency that exceeded 21%,” he said.
“This gives us hope that solar energy can continue to develop and improve as one of the most effective renewable and sustainable energy technologies.”

Shapter said the research, which involved scientists from École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland and Griffith University in Queensland, addresses an urgent need for alternative energy sources capable of providing efficient and reliable energy production.
“Silicon-based solar cells remain the dominant first-generation product making up 90% of the market, but demand was high for cells that could be manufactured without their high prices and complexity,” he said.
“Our research contributes to intensive efforts to develop various types of solar cells with the aim of realising efficient, stable and low-cost replacements for present silicon-based technology.”
The findings come with solar module manufacturing giants LONGi Green Energy, JinkoSolar, Trina Solar, JA Solar and Risen Energy warning that rising material costs – including the price of polysilicon which is used in an estimated 98% of solar PV cells – could trigger a solar panel shortage.
In an open letter published earlier this week, the Chinese-based manufacturers said their output is expected to be reduced as rising costs, an ongoing shipping “crisis”  and government-imposed restrictions take a toll on the supply chain.
The Chinese government has ordered silicon metal refineries in the country to cut output to about 70% amid a power crisis.

“The raw material supply gap is serious,” the companies said in the statement.
“This imbalance will break the supply chain and seriously endanger the healthy and sustainable development of the industry.
“Prices are also soaring.”
The manufacturers said the price of solar-grade polysilicon has surged in recent weeks by 9.1% while the price of solar glass has also climbed, up 18.2% year-on-year and there has been a 35% increase in the cost of adhesive films used in the manufacture of modules.
The manufacturers said the capacity shortage will make it difficult for customers to meet installation targets, warning that many signed orders will be lost.
“The … industry has been caught in a difficult situation,” they said.
The companies said they are actively coordinating resources and making every effort to “stabilize supply” but implored customers to considering postponing projects and to avoid the end-of-year “rush to install”.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/07/city-council-powers-ahead-with-4-mw-virtual-power-network/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 7, 2021",City council powers ahead with 4 MW virtual power network,"Hobsons Bay City Council, in Melbourne’s southwest, has commenced the roll out of its Large Scale Solar Installation Program with 4 MW of solar PV to be installed across dozens of council-owned assets.
The program will allow for the sharing of solar-generated energy among council-owned buildings, reducing council’s reliance on grid-supplied energy and helping it achieve its goal of zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.
Hobsons Bay Mayor Jonathon Marsden said the individual rooftop solar systems will generate renewable energy onsite with any surplus power to be moved from one building to another within the network.
The project has been dubbed a Virtual Energy Network (VEN) by council due to the absence of an energy storage component usually associated with  Virtual Power Plants (VPP) but the design does allow for the addition of batteries in the future.
Council is also exploring a community access model that would potentially allow households and businesses to participate in the energy network as a green energy generator or consumer.
Marsden said the distributed solar program would offer substantial benefits for the Hobsons Bay community but could also be used as a blueprint for other local government areas.
“We are sourcing innovative solutions using cutting-edge technology to reduce carbon emissions and produce almost 4 MW of low-cost green electricity,” he said.
“Our virtual power project provides substantial environmental, community and economic benefits, as well as creating local jobs.
“Importantly, it has the capacity to be expanded or replicated across the western region, Melbourne or Victoria, stimulating the same surge of benefits in communities across the state.
“We look forward to future opportunities to partner with the state government to expand the impact and benefits of this program.”

Hobsons Bay City Council already has a number of rooftop solar systems installed across its assets, including a 50 kW array on Altona North Community Library and a 55 kW system atop the Altona Meadows Library and Learning Centre.
Work has now commenced at the Altona Civic Centre which will host a 402 kW solar PV system, the Newport Community Hub (55 kW), and the Laverton community building (99 kW).
Melbourne-based firm Enervest has been appointed to oversee the design and installation of the rooftop solar system while Circle Energy has been engaged to provide the technology to transfer the renewable energy between buildings.
Enervest managing director Ross Warby said the project demonstrates great forward thinking and initiative for both the Hobsons Bay area and the broader community.
“The program will offset a significant amount of emissions related to electricity supply and champion the uptake of further renewables throughout the network,” he said.
When complete the system is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 4,000 tonnes per year, or about 55% of council’s total carbon emissions.
Council expects savings on energy costs will repay its infrastructure investment in the project within nine years.
The rooftop solar program is just one of the renewable energy initiatives implemented by council which has also adopted a fleet of electric vehicles, installed of a 50 kW DC electric vehicle fast-charging station for community use and signed on to participate in a collaborative Victorian Local Government power purchase agreement (PPA).
“We are doing our bit to be carbon neutral by 2020 and that is by reducing our base energy usage and by embracing more sustainable energy sources,” Marsden said. “We anticipate that all of these changes will result in a 70% reduction in our base energy consumption over the next 10 years.”

Irex, the PV module production unit of Vietnamese tech group SolarBK, has developed a special solar panel for applications in agrivoltaic projects.
“Irex uses specialised glass with calculated transparency for the module to ensure that the sunlight shines through, while balancing the temperature and humidity for the plants below,” the company’s director, Son Truong Giang, told pv magazine.
The Irex Agri-PV glass-glass panel has a power output of 265 W and a power conversion efficiency of 18.1%. It is fabricated with 48 bifacial monocrystalline cells measuring 158.75 mm x 158.75 mm x 2 mm, with tempered glass featuring an anti-reflective coating.
The frameless panel has a size of 2,004 mm x 998 mm x 6 mm and weighs 24 kg. Its open-circuit voltage is 35.68 V and its short-circuit current 9.75 A. The module can work with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and operating temperatures between -40 C and 85 C. It also features an IP68 enclosure rating and a claimed annual power degradation of 0.7%.
“The dimensions … are calculated to suit the geographical and climatic conditions of Vietnam,” the manufacturer said. “So the glass is not too thick – just enough to withstand heavy rain and strong impact.”
Irex currently owns and operates a 350 MW manufacturing facility in Vietnam’s Ba Ria-Vung Tau province.
