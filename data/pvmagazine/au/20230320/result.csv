In a development application lodged with the Toowoomba Regional Council, Brisbane-based Skylab said the plan is for the project to be developed in two stages with the first phase of construction to install 400 MW of solar along with the big battery and associated infrastructure including a substation.
Construction of the initial phase is slated to begin in the middle of 2024 and take about 18 months. Stage 2 of the project would add a further 400 MW of solar.
Skylab said the project, being developed on a 1,345-hectare site near Millmerran about 70 kilometres southwest of Toowoomba in the heart of the South West Queensland Renewable Energy Zone, will support state and national renewable energy targets and provide essential support as coal-fired generation capacity continues to exit the system.
“With direct access to the Powerlink transmission network this site provides the ultimate balance between connection and opportunity,” the company said.
“With recent decisions to phase out coal generation plants, this project is in the optimum location to replace ~900 MW of adjacent generation.”

The project is being built near the 825 MW coal-fired Millmerran Power Station that is currently scheduled to close in 2051 and will connect to the National Electricity Market (NEM) via Powerlink’s existing 330 kV electricity transmission line.
“Being located proximate to the Millmerran Power Station, the solar and energy storage facility will be able to maximise its access to the grid and its ability to export renewable energy into the power system,” Skylab said in its application.
Skylab is also progressing plans for the 94 MW Gunsynd Solar Farm near Goondiwindi in southwest Queensland. The company said it has secured a connection agreement for the project, which will also include 20 MW of energy storage capacity, and construction is expected to commence in the second quarter of this year.
The company’s portfolio also includes the Springvale Renewable Project near Townsville in north Queensland. The proposal includes a 400 MW solar farm with 100 MWh of battery energy storage and green hydrogen production capacity.

“As the world moves towards renewable energy, PV installations in Australia have been booming, particularly in the residential PV market, putting the country in the top 10 of the global PV market,” DAS said in a statement.
DAS Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Liu Yong said the company would investigate opportunities in the Australian market and is preparing to establish a branch here “in order to better serve the local market.”
The company has already released its first product into the Australian market, unveiling an all-black n-type bifacial solar panel with 54 M10 PV cells and a double-glass design for residential rooftop applications.
The Black-Thru series includes five different panels with power ratings of 410 W to 430 W, and efficiencies ranging from 21.0% to 22.0%. DAS claims a bifaciality factor of up to 80% with power gains ranging from 10% to 30% for the 410 MW and 430 MW modules, respectively.
The open-circuit voltage spans from 37.73 V to 38.49 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.91 A and 14.23 A. Each module measures 1,722 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weighs 24.7 kg.
The panels feature a junction box with an IP 68 rating and a frame made of anodised aluminium alloy. Both sides of the modules are covered with 1.6 mm glass. They have an operating temperature of between -40 C and 85 C, and a temperature coefficient is -0.3 % per degree Celsius.
“The Black-Thru module is even more advanced on weight load/m2 due to the lightweight dual-glass structure, which is 3 kg lighter than the same version of conventional dual-glass module and 0.7 kg lighter than monofacial module,” DAS said.
The series comes with a 30-year power output guarantee for 87.4% of the initial yield and a 15-year product warranty.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/20/kinaltek-announces-nanosilicon-tech-will-help-build-better-batteries/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 20, 2023",Kinaltek announces nanosilicon tech will help build better batteries,"Sydney company Kinaltek has announced a “revolutionary” breakthrough in the production of battery grade nanosilicon materials that it believes will allow battery manufacturers to exploit the benefits of silicon anodes to achieve high-density energy storage at a disruptively low cost.
Nanosilicon materials are expected to form a key component of next-generation lithium batteries with Kinaltek co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jawad Haidar saying the specific capacity of the anodes in batteries using silicon can be several times higher than those featuring conventional graphite-only anodes.
Haidar said until now the cost of nanosilcon has however been prohibitive with prices up to more than $1,400 (USD 1,000) per kilogram (kg) making the materials uneconomic for use in most common applications.
“The excessive cost is largely due to the complex, environmentally harmful, multi-step processes used in producing nanosilicon, such as chemical vapour deposition, plasma, ball milling etc,” he said.
Kinaltek said its patented KinSil technology is capable of directly converting common silica powders in a single step to silicon nanoparticles at a fraction of the cost of competing technologies.
Haidar said the process is an extension of the company’s technology which reduces metal oxides to metal powders under very mild conditions of atmospheric pressure and temperatures below 500 degrees Celsius.
“KinSil is capable of producing a range of high-value silicon nanoparticles, including silicon nanopowders (Si-NP), silicon nanowires (Si-NW) and silicon-carbon nanocomposites at a production cost between USD 5 per kg and USD 50 per kg depending on which type of nanoparticle you want,” he said.
“As a result, KinSil makes silicon nanoparticles economic for use in any application and indeed, it makes silicon cheaper than graphite both on a mass basis and on kW per kilogram basis.”
Haidar said the technology marks an important milestone on the road to next-generation energy storage solutions with the capacity of lithium batteries inherently limited by their graphite anode, which is capable of storing about 300 milliampere hours mAh per gram of graphite. Kinaltek is aiming to bring enhanced high-performance nanosilicon to market with energy density up to 1,400 mAh per gram.
“The ability of KinSil to produce low-cost silicon nanowires and carbon-coated nanosilicon can be a game changer for lithium batteries,” Haidar said.
“High-performance nanowires and C-Si nanocomposites produced at a fraction of current prices can disrupt the energy storage market.”
Kinaltek said its technology is also capable of recycling silicon from end-of-life solar panels into nanosilicon through a simple primary step adapting the solar silicon for use as precursors for its process.
In addition, the company said its KinSil technology has less than 20% of the carbon footprint of conventional multi-step processes and by-product is recyclable.
Haidar said the KinSil technology, developed in the company’s pilot facility at Villawood in Sydney, has been successfully tested on a lab scale at 1 kg level and the company has progressed to working on a pilot plant at ton quantity scale.
The company said the technology has already attracted significant interest from end-users, with the company talking to some of “the biggest manufacturers in the game.”
Despite this interest, Haidar said Kinaltek is currently negotiating a “significant” private investment to scale up the technology to commercial production which would allow the company to manufacture and commercialise its technology through supplying battery grade silicon-carbon composites and other nanosilicon products to the battery sectors.
“With adequate government support and market traction, Kinaltek hopes to keep its base in Australia,” he said.

The European Commission says it has set out new plans to stimulate hydrogen production through the creation of the European Hydrogen Bank (EHB) by the end of this year. It will also launch an auction system by the third quarter with the EHB for renewable hydrogen production. It will support hydrogen producers via a fixed price per kilogram for a maximum of 10 operational years. The EHB will define financing mechanisms to create a continental hydrogen market, import hydrogen into the European Union, increase transparency, and coordinate with other institutions and private investors. The EU expects total hydrogen investment to reach €335 billion  to €471 billion ($537 – 755 billion), including €200 billion to €300 billion ($320 – 480 billion) for additional renewable energy production.
Fortescue Future Industries has agreed to develop a green energy and fertiliser project in Kenya. The Kenyan government will provide support in relation to critical resources, infrastructure, and off-take. The main focus will be on the production of fertilizer with green ammonia. 
Ceres Power has signed contracts with Linde Engineering and Bosch to jointly validate the performance, cost, and operational functionality of its SOEC technology. The companies said they plan to start a two-year, 1 MW SOEC pilot system in 2024 at a Bosch site in Stuttgart, Germany. Ceres Power is now testing its first 100 kW electrolyser module and its initial results are providing confidence that this technology can deliver green hydrogen at less than 40 kWh/kg, which is purportedly 25% more efficiently than incumbent lower-temperature technologies. 
Saudi Aramco and Linde Engineering have agreed to jointly develop new-ammonia cracking technology. “A potential differentiator of this new technology is the ammonia cracking catalyst, jointly developed by Aramco and the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), which will be evaluated against other catalysts,” said Saudi Aramco. It will work with Linde Engineering to showcase the new ammonia-cracking technology at a demonstration plant in northern Germany.
Innovation Norway, the Norwegian government’s platform to support industrial innovation and development, has granted NOK 50 million ($7 million) of development support to TECO 2030. The funds will back the deployment of TECO 2030’s PEM fuel cell technology in applications for shipping and heavy-duty industry.
Fenton Mobility Products has selected Ideanomics to build five hydrogen-powered, zero-emission transit vans for the Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority (RGRTA). The value of RGRTA’s order exceeds USD 2.2 million ($3.3 million). The cost of the buses is covered with funds from a USD 23 million grant the RGRTA received from the US Department of Transportation to deploy hydrogen fuel cell buses,” said Ideanomics.
Italy has published a call for proposals to select decarbonisation projects using green hydrogen in hard-to-abate sectors. The total budget stands at €1 billion ($1.6 billion).

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/20/reshoring-of-us-solar-manufacturing/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 20, 2023",Reshoring of US solar manufacturing,"From pv magazine USA
SEIA’s vision and goal is that by end of this decade, the United States will be the most competitive, collaborative solar and energy storage industry in the world, and that will be accomplished with a workforce made up of American workers and its allies.
In “American Solar and Storage Manufacturing Renaissance: Managing the Transition Away from China,” SEIA points out that the move away from an over-reliance on imports for solar energy is beginning. And while we will not completely abandon global markets and supply chains, the momentum will build to the point where we can reduce our reliance on China for solar and energy storage equipment and raw materials.
SEIA reports that the United States has the capacity to produce many of the elements that are key to the solar industry: metallurgical grade silicon, polysilicon, steel, aluminum, resins, racking and mountings and other key materials. There is already a modest capacity to produce modules, inverters and trackers, and a limited source of domestic specialty glass. However, other elements have been missing almost entirely from the US supply chain, such as solar ingots, wafers and cells.
The US Inflation Reduction Act provides myriad incentives for the build out of US manufacturing, and it has effectively stimulated a number of companies to announce the intent to set up domestic manufacturing facilities. The buildout takes time, however, and for the next few years we will remain dependent on imports to fuel the rapid deployment of solar energy systems needed for the energy transition.
The largest source of solar cells and modules is currently Southeast Asia, which has manufacturing facilities run by manufacturers that have demonstrated the quality, financial stability, and compliance necessary to underwrite warrantees for their products demanded by US consumers.
While sourcing product from Southeast Asia is preferable to China, it means that the United States is still beholden to other countries to help fuel our energy transition. This presents risks, as witnessed by the supply chain challenges faced by Southeast Asia manufacturers over the past few years. According to SEIA, the best way to limit risks and build more resilient supply chains is to significantly expand domestic manufacturing.

Reshoring manufacturing
The manufacturing announcements stimulated by the IRA will amount to what SEIA estimates at 47 GW of new modules, over 16 GW of cells, more than 16 GW of ingots and wafers, nearly 9 GWac of inverters and well over 100 GWh of battery manufacturing (which serves the solar as well as the electric vehicle industry). SEIA also estimates that we can anticipate more than 20,000 tons of annual domestic polysilicon capacity coming back online and a multitude of new investments in tracker and racking capacity. And this is just the start—SEIA forecasts that we will see exponential growth in all of these sectors.
Timelines

As the chart above shows, it will take some time before domestic manufacturing fills in the gaps across the entire domestic supply chain. Polysilicon production, for example, will take until the fall of 2025 before U.S. production will be sold to domestic ingot/wafer manufacturers. And it will be after that that we begin to see any capacity in domestically produced ingots, wafers and cells. In the meantime, U.S. module makers will have to rely on imported ingots, wafers and cells. Similarly, inverter manufacturers will have to import chips, capacitors and transformers before factories supported by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 are commissioned. SEIA notes that it’s essential to allow necessary and ethical imports to continue during this transition period.
For more on timelines read Can the U.S. fill domestic supply chain gaps?
As we shore up the domestic supply chain, SEIA cautions that manufacturers will need reliable access to components, materials, and consumables, which will require having multiple sources and suppliers. In the short to mid-term, we will remain dependent on imports, yet bringing more robust solar manufacturing to the United States will avoid some of the risks the industry has faced in the past three years by heavy dependence on imports.
