“Transmission takes a long time to built… while you’re waiting for that transmission, there will be volatile and higher electricity prices. The natural response to that will be to install rooftop PV or install storage, potentially local storage, potentially local transmission-enhancing storage, all that sort of stuff.”
“Batteries will get done quicker than transmission, so they will erode the business case for transmission. But the transmission will get built anyway, and that will erode the business case for batteries.”

While this business case conundrum most pointedly impacts big battery projects, which earn most of their revenue from spot markets, distributed energy resources like rooftop solar and network batteries will continue to utterly transform energy systems.
In April, Dr Gabrielle Kuiper, a director of the Superpower Institute, pointed to ITP Renewables modelling which found that when Australia eventually reaches its saturation point with distributed energy resources, there exists a pathway in which rooftop solar plus battery trading will cut the wholesale market’s evening peak by 67–92%. 
The demand forecasts which have underpinned much of Australia’s transition modelling to date are increasingly being questioned, given the fact models – as Kuiper points out – have the shortfall of relying on a past which is likely completely different to the energy future.
Johnston describes the assumption that Australia should be building copious amounts of transmission as something that has remained, until vey recently, “unexamined.” A growing choir of industry insiders are questioning whether the current extent of planned transmission projects are in fact vital, but this is also a relatively recent shift.

Johnston notes that in the same way rooftop solar undercut legacy energy monopolies, batteries will undercut Australia’s state-based transmission network service provider (TNSP) monopolies.
While transmission does “achieve more efficient outcomes” as Johnston puts it, he says, “we certainly don’t want to wait for that to happen before we start building [renewables] out.”
After the widespread glee around Australia’s emergence from a decade of inaction in 2022, this year has seen industry and governments reckon with the deep complexity of the task before us.
“There’s just going to be a bit of chaos and carnage along the way, from my perspective,” Johnston says.
“Everyone is going to be affected in some way. We’re going to have to transition from the current way we price energy for new market design,” he adds. Consumers are somewhat insulated from volatile wholesale market prices, “but network prices probably need to evolve both in terms of time-of-use pricing but also local system services pricing,” he says.
“Basically there is going to be a whole heap price volatility, there’s going to be some regulatory changes that come along and all of this will create some winners and losers. And there will be people who are winners at some time and losers at other times – that’s part of it.”
“It starts to be like riding the sharemarket a bit where you don’t really have much influence over it. You’re riding it, but it’s not like you can pull out of it very easily.”
Of course, fossil generation is going to be completely hallowed out in this process – something already well underway, Warwick notes.
Coming back to the tension between batteries and transmission, Johnston says, “once you go through that and get to the other end you go, ‘oh well we need it all.’”
“This is an ultimately painful stepping stone from an energy system that was as it was to something with zero marginal cost power.”

Specifically, the project’s transformer and high voltage balance of plant components, provided by Powerlink, and the Tesla Megapack units have been energised, allowing the project to begin the commissioning stages.
The commissioning phase is expected to be completed in the coming months to ensure the Bouldercombe battery is fully operational ahead of summer’s peak demand.
Genex Power noted the Bouldercombe battery will be operated under a ‘Autobidder Offtake Agreement’ with Tesla. “Under this agreement, Tesla will operate the plant to maximise revenues in the energy arbitrage and frequency control ancillary services markets, while providing a guaranteed minimum level of revenues,” it said. “The upside above this minimum level is largely captured by Genex with a portion shared with Tesla to align incentives between the parties.”
Genex last year ran into problems with its flagship Kidston Clean Energy Hub, which includes a pumped hydro component, rocking the company’s share price. Despite the hiccups, the far north Queensland project expanded its wind component from 200 MW to up to 258 MW, adding to the existing 50 MW solar farm and the 250 MW/2,000 MWh pumped hydro energy storage facility which is currently being constructed. An additional 270 MW of solar has also been proposed.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/28/new-meaning-given-to-crap-solar-with-melbourne-warehouses-rooftop-install/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 28, 2023",New meaning given to ‘crap’ solar with Melbourne warehouse’s rooftop install,"The cheeky installation took two years to realise and sits atop a Melbourne warehouse managed by property company MCM.
Few details on the project – including the capacity of the system and which companies where involved in the install – were included in the announcement, but it appears to have been completed using a Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) model, popular in the commercial and industrial segment. 
Most commercial warehouses are rented, giving rise to a conundrum about who should pay for a system which largely profits tenants. Solar companies have found a path forward here by choosing to own the system themselves and sell the solar power to the tenant for a reduced rate.
In the announcement, Who Gives A Crap says the financing option used by MCM meant the project had “no upfront costs for either party,” suggesting a PPA route.
The company also said the installation has saved it around 24% on its month’s electricity bill.
“We are planning to expand solar to all of our Australian warehouses within the next 12 months and have just launched the first ever electric vehicle toilet paper fleet,” Elissa Foster, Head of Sustainability at Who Gives A Crap, said. “We’re also looking into end of life battery solutions to tie it all together.”
“Most emissions are produced by the corporate sector — so if every single company can reduce their emissions, then we can finally get to a point where we start to significantly reduce our impacts on climate change,” Simon Griffiths, CEO and co-founder of Who Gives A Crap, added. “Ultimately, it doesn’t matter how profitable your business is in the long run if we don’t have a world that’s worth living in. 
“That means we all have a duty to rethink the relationship between profit and environmental impact, but in this instance we’ve been able to reduce costs and improve environmental impact – it’s absolutely win-win.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/28/queensland-cuts-exploration-fees-funds-zone-design-and-waste-streams-in-decisive-critical-minerals-strategy/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 28, 2023","Queensland cuts exploration fees, funds zone design and waste streams in decisive critical minerals strategy","Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has launched the Queensland Critical Mineral Strategy at the World Mining Congress held in Brisbane this week. 
In the strategy, the state government lays out a much clearer plan of action including abolishing exploration permit fees for the next five years, establishing critical mineral zones as well as a centralised oversight body, funding waste stream initiatives, instigating collaboration between research hubs, and running an international communications campaign.
The total investment in these initiatives is $245 million (USD 162 million), just shy of the half the amount currently being put forward by the federal government under its newly launched critical minerals strategy. While industry has pointed out both figures pale in comparison to the funding provided internationally, the Queensland government’s strategy is more precise and employs more policy levers than its Commonwealth counterpart.
Key policies of the strategy include:
The strategy also pointed back to the government’s $100 million ‘Critical Minerals and Battery Technology Fund’ which was formerly announced to support new projects and investments. 
Like fellow mining state Western Australia, Queensland is eager to replace is waning export resources with the critical minerals needed for renewable technologies of the future. Given refining and processing these minerals onshore is forecast to double revenues, which can be further grown by manufacturing higher value products like electrolytes or battery precursor materials, the state has been actively working to recruit manufacturing into the region – successfully lobbying billionaire Andrew Forrest’s Fortescue Future Industries to manufacture there, among others like iron-flow battery maker Energy Storage Industries.

“If we do not manufacture our future, someone else will, leaving Queensland to remain a low-end supplier of minerals and nothing more,” Queensland Resources Minister Scott Stewart rather bluntly said.
Queensland’s critical mineral ambitions hinge on the CopperString 2032 transmission line, which will connect the North West Minerals Province to the North Queensland Renewable Energy Zone. While minerals are not limited to this province, it is understood to have particularly rich deposits of things like copper, lead, zinc, nickel, cobalt, tungsten, graphite, vanadium and silica, as well as silver, phosphate and rare earths.

This transmission infrastructure will be vital since, as the Queensland government notes in its strategy, there is growing market demand for ‘clean’ materials – that is minerals and derivatives that don’t involve carbon emissions in their extraction. This push will prove beneficial for places like Queensland because its exports tend to be more expensive, but the importance of this fact is diminishing in a global market where Environmental Social Governance (ESG) credentials are more highly valued.
The government is kicking off this design initiative, which is widely seen as sensible by those in industry, with $75 million in funding. 
The government is proposing two zones at the moment: one around Julia Creek and Richmond, and another just west of that in Mount Isa. Both these zones sit within the North West Minerals Province, with the Julia Creek zone set to focus on vanadium while the Mount Isa zone will focus on “secondary prospectively in mine waste.”
Consultation will be undertaken to investigate this approach at other locations, the strategy notes, pointing to the possibility of a further zone in Cape Flattery focusing on silica.
“A place-based approach will be undertaken where projects are co-located in one regional area,” the strategy reads. “This approach will leverage collaboration opportunities to achieve time, resource and capital efficiencies. Each zone will be unique, and government actions will be tailored according to geography, stakeholder priority and concerns, and the minerals targeted.”

This hub approach will allow coordinated development of common-user infrastructure, supporting economies of scale as well as providing opportunities to make use of mineralisation in mining wastes, it says. Finally, the zone design is expected to expedite community consultation – which will undoubtedly be a hurdle for the burgeoning industry.
“Establishing future zones will be in line with the aspirations of First Nations peoples, and other commitments from the government including future world heritage listings,” the strategy says.
Biodiversity and environmental protection which again will undoubtedly prove problematic for developing a critical minerals industry, given mineral deposits often sit under untouched vegetation in Australia, is addressed in the plan. “Baseline studies for the critical mineral zones may also inform a bioregional plan… The intent of bioregional plans is to provide improved protection of important areas of biodiversity while providing greater certainty about where development can and cannot go, and identify areas where further consideration of environmental values is required.”
Another key action in the strategy, funded to the tune of $5 million, is looking at how to create more circular systems. That is, figuring out how minerals can be sourced through means other than virgin mining.
To that end, the strategy notes “the right regulatory framework” needs to be in place to facilitate this, with the government planning to review its frameworks, including consideration of a new ‘Residual Mineral Recovery Tenure’ and investigation into the current risk assessment criteria.

The state has also allocated $8 million towards a research institute–government minerals alliance looking at circularity within mining. “The Queensland Government will also investigate establishing a collaborative model between the Sustainable Minerals Institute (University of Queensland) and other research institutions to focus on critical minerals.”
As mentioned, this dedicated Critical Minerals Office has been set up as a centralised point for industry, investors and community. It will coordinate pre-lodgement meetings with relevant stakeholders and government agencies as well as market Queensland internationally and work with the Australian Government to leverage bilateral free trade agreements.

Alongside removing exploration permit fees, the Queensland government plans to continue its active recruitment of projects and ultimately investment. There seems to be funds for international marketing, and the government says it will also create a (presumably online) portal to give investors access to up-to-date information about Queensland’s critical mineral opportunity, projects and other market intelligence.
Likely a response to the public’s generally cool reception of the mining industry, which has a long history of misdeeds in Australia, the strategy notes the government “will work with industry to improve their ESG performance and reporting to ensure best practice and the ability to meet anticipated future requirements from consumers, investors, local communities and First Nations peoples.”
To jazz that up a little, it is considering handing out awards for ESG performance, and wants to ensure research and methods which improve ESG practices are shared within the industry.
With a $100 million dollar investment, the fund seems to be a significant channel for the state, but how it works is more vague than the rest of the strategy. 
“The Fund will provide support for local businesses and industry-led consortia to build industry capability in Queensland, providing greater access to national and global supply chains in metal refining, mineral processing and battery technology,” the strategy says.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/28/impact-of-solar-module-soiling-on-grid-forming-inverters/,"INVERTERS,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,SERBIA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 28, 2023",Impact of solar module soiling on grid-forming inverters,"From pv magazine Global
An international research group has investigated the effect that solar panel soiling in urban environments may have on the proper functioning of grid-forming (GFo) controlled DC-AC inverters.
Grid-forming inverters are inverters that can support the grid by creating adjustable voltage and frequency and can operate microgrids without conventional synchronous power generators. They can also act as primary mechanisms to improve grid synchronisation, especially during low-inertia operating conditions.
The scientists utilised a new approach based on numerically represented I–V curves to assess the impact of soiling on a PV array operating as a hybrid microgrid system with storage and using single-stage GFo inverters.
In the proposed system configuration, two inverters are utilised, with one being the interface between the AC side and 11.2%-efficient PV panels with a power output of 60 W and a tilt angle of 32 degrees, and the other being the connection between the battery and the AC side.
“This kind of grid topology is universal in a certain way because it enables the operation isolated from the main public distribution grid,” the research team explained. “Each of the mentioned inverters is equipped with its own control circuit, which generally functions as a local primary controller, and can possibly be included in the hierarchy of the local energy management system (EMS), as a subordinate.”
The academics analysed the I–V curves of the soiled photovoltaic panel while also considering irradiation, ambient temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity at the PV testing site located in Niš, southern Serbia, for 168 days. Through these testing operations, the scientists found that solar module soiling has a “significant” impact on microgrid functionality, with power yield being reduced by up to 30%.
“Namely, this leads to potential problems in the micro-grid stability in the case of power disturbances because the critical value of the MPP voltage can be easily exceeded and the entire PV system can enter an unstable operation mode,” they further explained.
Their findings are available in the paper “Performance evaluation of single-stage photovoltaic inverters under soiling conditions,” which was recently published in Ain Shams Engineering Journal. The group includes researchers from the University of Niš in Serbia and the University of Montenegro.
“Soiling is a particularly big problem that must be investigated in more detail in the future, taking into account the fact that the operation mode with GFo algorithms is favoured not only in isolated grids, which is the traditional solution, but also in multi-generator grids, which is a modern solution from the aspect of significantly better dynamic performances,” it concluded.

SEG Solar has signed an 80-year lease with Indonesian industrial real estate development agency, Kawasan Industri Terpadu Batang (KITB), for a 41-hectare site in Batang, central Indonesia.
The US company said it intends to invest USD 500 million ($747,000) to develop the land for a 5 GW of cell and 3 GW of module capacity. It will make the investment through SEG ATW Solar Manufaktur Indonesia, its joint venture with ATW Investasi Selaras, an Indonesian renewable energy developer.
The project is scheduled to be completed in the second quarter of 2024. It will be one of Indonesia’s largest solar cell and module factories, according to SEG.
“The country offers a supportive environment with favourable policies, taxation benefits and abundant silicon resources,” said SEG Solar CEO Jim Wood.
The Batang cell production line will supply SEG Solar’s recently announced 2 GW module factory in Houston, enabling the company to become more vertically integrated, it said in a statement. It recently reported plans to develop module manufacturing equipment with Suzhou Horad New Energy Equipment to produce 2 GW of tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar modules in Texas.
