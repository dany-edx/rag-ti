United States-based engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) giant Bechtel, North American transmission specialist Hatch, professional services firms Marsh and PwC Australia, and Australia-headquartered engineering outfit SMEC, a member of the Singapore-based Surbana Jurong Group, have been listed as members of the project delivery team.
The announcement comes just weeks after Sun Cable revealed the generation capacity of what is already shaping as the world’s largest solar PV and storage project would be ramped up, with the solar PV farm increased from the original 10 GW to between 17 and 20 GW. The capacity of the battery energy storage system has also been boosted, from the initial 20 GWh to between 36 and 42 GWh of storage.
The intercontinental project, being developed on a 12,000-hectare site at Powell Creek in the Northern Territory’s Barkly region, will supply power to Darwin and to Singapore via a 4,500-kilometre high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission network, including a 750km overhead transmission line from the solar farm to Darwin and a 3,800km HVDC submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore.
Construction of the key components of the AAPowerLink project is expected to begin from late 2023, with first supply of electricity to Darwin in 2026 and first electricity to Singapore in 2027 with full capacity expected by the end of 2028.

Sun Cable chief executive officer David Griffin said on Wednesday the combined experience of the IPDT across environmental, social and governance frameworks will be essential in delivering a project of such scale and significance with each of the “carefully selected” companies having a proven track record in developing and delivering complex infrastructure projects.
“To secure the support of these globally recognised experts is an important vote of confidence in the significance and feasibility of Sun Cable’s Australia-Asia PowerLink,” he said.
“Sun Cable is proud to have the expertise of Bechtel, Hatch, SMEC, Marsh, and PwC Australia reinforcing our team, as we deliver this game-changing infrastructure for Australia, Indonesia and Singapore.
“This project is designed to significantly accelerate the carbon-zero ambitions of the region and we have brought together a dream team to bring it to fruition.”
The project, which is anticipated will be capable of supplying up to 15% of Singapore’s electricity needs, has already secured key approvals with the Australian federal government awarding it Major Project Status while the Indonesian government last month approved the submarine transmission cable route and granted approval to undertake the next stage of the subsea cable survey.
James Phillis, chief executive of SMEC Australia and New Zealand, said the “size, scale and importance” of the project meant it looms as a “game-changer” for the renewable energy sector.
“The Australia-Asia PowerLink will be the world’s largest solar energy infrastructure network and will be a game-changer for the renewable energy sector worldwide,” he said.
“As a member of the project delivery team, SMEC is excited to be a critical force in bringing this project to life.”

The AAPowerLink is the latest in a long line of renewable energy projects SMEC has worked on in Australia. The company said it has been directly involved in the development of more than 6.4 GW worth of utility-scale solar farms in Australia, including Risen Energy’s 100 MW Yarranlea Solar Farm in Queensland and the massive 720 MW New England Solar Farm being developed in New South Wales by UPC/AC Renewables Australia.
SMEC is also involved in Project EnergyConnect, a 900km proposed electricity interconnector being delivered by network operators TransGrid and ElectraNet and the $4.6 billion Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project, which when complete will provide 2 GW of dispatchable, on-demand renewable power and approximately 350 GWh of large-scale energy storage to the National Electricity Market (NEM).
Meanwhile, PwC Australia chief executive Tom Seymour said he expected the AAPowerLink project, which is expected abate an estimated 8.6 million tonnes of carbon emissions, will provide once-in-a-lifetime economic opportunities for communities and supply chain businesses across Australia.
“This complex and ambitious project is unlike anything previously developed. It will make a generational impact on Australia and Singapore,” he said.
“It will pave the way for a new Australian export industry that will create jobs and change lives.”

CCIC will provide the governance structure and platform for the manufacturing cluster while Star Scientific will work with the food companies to provide carbon-free heat using its HERO technology, a coating substance which can be applied to ceramics or certain metals and which, upon contact with hydrogen and oxygen, increases in temperature from zero to above 700 degrees Celsius in three minutes.
Star Scientific global group chairman Andrew Horvath said the heat reaction technology, which earlier this year won the Sustainable Energy Council’s World Hydrogen Award for Industrial Application, can drive industrial processes that need high heat using renewable hydrogen.
“Food manufacturers all over the world are looking for solutions to remove carbon from industrial processes such as heating, drying and cleaning,” he said.
“The Central Coast region is home to some of Australia’s biggest household brands and global food manufacturers, many of whom are realising the potential of hydrogen and our HERO technology to meet their heating needs.”

Hovarth said the company, which has an 8,500 square metre research and development facility in Berkeley Vale on the Central Coast, has already commenced work under the MoU providing heat for industrial-scale cleaning purposes in the food hub.
Horvath said the collaboration marks the first commercial application of HERO technology in the world and the cluster would be designed to be as inclusive as possible with ambitions to engage and share knowledge with similar ventures emerging across Australia and New Zealand.
“We want this cluster to be an incubator of regulatory issues for the hydrogen supply chain, and more specifically, green hydrogen made from renewable energy,” he said.
“Regulators are coming to grips with the use of green hydrogen and we hope the cluster will enable us to identify those issues early in the process and deal with them.”
CCIC executive director Frank Sammut said the collaboration would allow the companies involved in the hub to move away from traditional heat sources, saying taking steps to decarbonise is important for the manufacturing sector as a whole, including food and beverage manufacturing.
“Manufacturers have turned to renewable electricity sources to reduce their carbon footprint but alternatives to gas for heating and cooking continues to be a challenge across a number of uses,” he said.
“The MoU with Star Scientific provides the opportunity for developing that alternative carbon-free heat source.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/20/new-horizons-secures-contract-for-was-biggest-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,EUROPE,ITALY,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 20, 2021",New Horizons secures contract for WA’s biggest battery,"The Western Australian Government has awarded a $155 million contract to deliver what will be the state’s biggest lithium-ion battery to the Australian arm of New Horizons Ahead (NHOA), the rebranded energy storage and e-mobility solutions company formerly known as Engie EPS.
The proposed big battery, which will connect to the state’s main grid, known as the South-West Interconnected System (SWIS), will have the capacity to power the equivalent of 160,000 homes for two hours.
NHOA said in a company statement the building and construction phase of the project will commence in November with the battery expected to be operational by the end of 2022.
NHOA has already awarded a $50 million contract to Perth-based contractor GenusPlus Group for the engineering, procurement, construction (EPC) and commissioning of the big battery.
The battery will be managed by Synergy, Western Australia’s state-owned energy generator and retailer and is intended to support the integration of more renewable energy into the grid, smooth fluctuations in demand and renewable-energy supply and substantially contribute to grid security and stability.
One in three WA households already have rooftop solar panels and this is expected to rise to 50% by 2030 and Synergy said the battery will be able to store excess solar energy during the day, when demand is low, and discharge electricity rapidly during the afternoon and evening peak, providing additional security and stability to WA’s power system.
“Increasing levels of large-scale and rooftop intermittent renewable generation has led the rapid transformation of the energy sector, presenting a range of opportunities related to how electricity is produced, managed and consumed,” the company said.
“The battery project will enable Synergy to optimise the use of its existing generation assets and provide network and system services to increase system security, providing a more sustainable, reliable and effective power supply to the wider region.”
WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston said the Kwinana battery forms part of the state government’s broader Energy Transformation Strategy, which incorporates not only the distributed energy resource work stream, but whole-of-system planning and the development of foundational regulatory frameworks that will improve access to the SWIS for renewable energy resources and supporting technologies.
“WA’s biggest battery will support more renewable energy technologies joining the grid and help increase power stability,” he said.
Johnston labelled NHOA, which was launched after the majority acquisition of Engie EPS by Taiwan Cement Corporation (TCC) earlier this year, as of one of the world’s top utility-scale energy storage organisations, saying it has installed batteries and microgrids in 26 countries.
WA Premier Mark McGowan said the state government has committed $140 million towards the big battery project, with the Commonwealth Government contributing $15 million.
“This battery is crucial to WA’s sustainable energy future and a key part of the Distributed Energy Resources Roadmap,” McGowan said.
“There is a rapid energy transformation happening and energy storage systems such as this battery will play a key role in providing better energy outcomes for Western Australian households and businesses.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/20/report-finds-co-located-hubs-key-to-battery-industry-competitiveness/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,EMPLOYMENT,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,EUROPE,GERMANY,JAPAN,UNITED STATES,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"OCTOBER 20, 2021",Report finds co-located hubs key to battery industry competitiveness,"A report published by the Future Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre (FBICRC) has emphasised the role of co-located energy hubs for nations wishing to compete in the growing battery industry. 
The author of the report, University of Western Australia (UWA) academic Kirsten Martinus, said that while energy hub development in the U.S., Germany and Japan were all various in their own ways, a common denominator amongst successful hubs was the benefits of co-location and collaboration. 
Given Australia’s wealth of mineral resources, what the report called “Australian ‘luck'”, Martinus believes Australia holds a competitive advantage for hub development. “One of the major challenges in attracting investment in establishing a domestic downstream battery material refining and manufacturing hub is the competition from countries in the northern hemisphere, who are also keen to realise the economic benefit from locating as many aspects of their supply chain within their own region. 
Indeed, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde this week reiterated the high vulnerability the European economy has to systemic chocks from supply chain disruptions due to its globalised nature. Many in Europe have seen the global supply chain disruptions related to Covid-19, ethical concerns in China’s Xinjiang region (and resulting geopolitical action), and various other economic dominoes such as the current energy price surge, and come to the opinion that energy sovereignty through its own domestic supply chain is the only way to go. 

However, the development of a domestic manufacturing industry in Europe won’t happen overnight, and even if the continent can nurture its own renewable energy production industries, FBICRC CEO Stedman Ellis pointed to Australia’s “strong value proposition in meeting the rapidly growing demand for batteries, and a desire to diversify supply chains and to demonstrate high standards of ESG performance.” These are all qualities attractive to northern hemisphere markets.  
Ellis pointed to the momentum already evident in the emerging technical grade battery chemicals industry in Kwinana and Kemerton, Western Australia (WA). 
However, Australia still has some way to go if it is going to key industry players in the battery manufacturing industry and move further into downstream production to take advantage of its natural wealth in what is a rapidly growing market on the verge of exponential expansion through trends like EV uptake. 
The report compared three case studies of battery manufacturing hub development:

“The key lessons from the international case studies” the report concluded, “was they did not offer the cheapest labour, nor provide a perfect hub location in all aspects, but that industry and government collaborated to identify and leverage competitive advantages to strengthen regional development.” 
Compared to these examples, Australia is at a relative distance from battery consumer markets and its supportive policy measures are mediocre at best. In order to overcome these disadvantages, the report recommends, among other things, for Australia to leverage its resources, to aggregate production efficiencies through site strategic selection and design, insist upon a circular economy and introduce resource traceability technologies. 

If Australia can take advantage of this early momentum toward establishing battery hubs, says Ellis, it could achieve “a diversified battery industry in Australia worth AUD$7.4 billion in value annually and support over 34,000 jobs by 2030.” 
However, in order to interest global markets in a post-pandemic world of supply-chain sensitivity, Australia will not only need to leverage its resources but ensure the its ESG measures are world-leading. Of course, competition from battery hubs in the U.S., Germany and Japan will have to do the same.

Vulcan Energy Resources, a materials company that is ramping up plans for zero-carbon lithium production in Germany, has signed a long-term supply agreement to supply Umicore with lithium hydroxide for its production of cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries.
The agreement will see Vulcan supply between 28,000 and 42,000 tons of lithium hydroxide to the Belgian materials giant over a five-year period beginning from 2025, with the option to extend for another five years with mutual agreement. This will represent approximately 20% of Vulcan’s planned output for the period. Pricing will be based on market prices for lithium hydroxide on a take or pay basis, and the agreement is still dependent on the securing of project finance, construction and commissioning of the plants and full product qualification for Vulcan’s zero carbon lithium project.
“Umicore, a leading cathode manufacturer and the first in Europe, will be a valuable offtake partner for Vulcan, as a direct consumer of Vulcan’s lithium hydroxide products. With our recent announcements of agreements with LG Energy Solution and Renault Group, we now have a diversified mix of offtakers from the cathode, battery and automotive sectors, with further agreements expected in the near term,” said Francis Wedin, managing director at Vulcan Energy Resources. “We look forward to a long and fruitful cooperation with Umicore as we progress our Zero carbon lithium project.”
Vulcan is working on scaling up its zero carbon lithium project, which aims to produce both geothermal energy and battery grade lithium hydroxide by pumping geothermal brine from deep in the earth at a site in Germany’s Upper Rhine Valley. Once the heated brine has been used to produce energy, it is processed into high purity lithium hydroxide monohydrate at another facility.
The company has demonstrated production of LHM exceeding minimum quality specifications for the battery industry, and last month it secured a site outside of Frankfurt, Germany for its planned commercial processing facility, where it hopes to begin large-scale production sometime in 2024.
Umicore, meanwhile, is expecting to begin production of cathode materials at its new facility in Nysa, Poland by the end of this year. It is calling the plant the first CO2 neutral factory for cathode materials in Europe. The plant will supply battery cell and electric vehicle manufacturers, and is powered by 100% renewable energy from a nearby wind farm, under a corporate PPA with Engie. Umicore has also signed a supply agreement with Chinese company Ganfeng Lithium Co. Ltd to supply it with Australian-sourced lithium as of 2022, and is expected to cover a significant portion of Umicore’s lithium requirements in Asia.
“In light of the accelerating transition to electromobility it is crucial to secure a reliable supply of critical raw materials, that is also environmentally and socially responsible,” added Umicore CEO Mathias Miedreich. “These long-term supply agreements mark another important step in Umicore’s sustainable procurement strategy and demonstrate our strong commitment to support the growth of our global customers through the creation of sustainable and regional battery materials value chains.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/20/solar-farms-prove-to-bee-hives-of-economic-activity/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,RESEARCH,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,SPAIN,UNITED KINGDOM",BLAKE MATICH,"OCTOBER 20, 2021",Solar farms prove to bee hives of economic activity,"From pv magazine Global. 
Bees are extremely important, not just because my name starts with one, but also because they’re responsible for approximately 70% of the fruits, vegetables and nuts we humans consume daily. However, since the mid-2000s a species threatening “Colony Collapse Disorder” has seen commercial bee populations decimated.
For this reason, scientific researchers have been investigating novel land management practices and some of the most promising involve the symbiotic relationship between agriculture and PV. One such study, published in the journal Biological Conservation, examined the economic benefits of beehive integration with solar farms. 
The symbiotic benefits of agrivoltaics are increasingly well documented, and many have suggested incorporating honeybee hives on solar parks as a symbiotic twofold solution to the problems of bee populations and expanded renewable energy capacity.
In the United Kingdom (UK) a team of researchers from the universities of Lancaster and Reading have published a study finding that the value of UK agriculture could be boosted by millions of pounds annually if honeybee hives were incorporated on solar parks throughout the country. 
However, the scientists behind the study made it clear that wild pollinators should be prioritised over honeybees where appropriate when it comes to the management of solar farms. Solar farms are essential to the energy transition and environmental sustainability, but they do occupy large tracts of land and should, therefore, bring added environmental and commercial benefits where possible. 
Of course, many solar farms are located in agricultural regions where wild pollinator habitats have been long-degraded or eradicated. For these, honeybee hives would be welcome additions, providing pollinators that would increase crop production. 
“Managing solar parks for honeybees can have positive impacts on crop yields and thus financial returns,” said Alona Armstrong, senior lecturer at Lancaster University, “But, it is important to consider the suitability on a site by site basis given the potential implications for wild pollinators and the benefits of managing sites for biodiversity more broadly.”
Solar P-Bee
Of course, there are solar farms that already have bees hard at work. For instance, Iberdrola has built an apiary at its Andévalo photovoltaic plant near Huelva, in Spain’s Andalucia region, hosting 165 beehives and more than 8 million bees, and another one at its Núñez de Balboa project in Usagre, near Badajoz in the country’s Extremadura region, hosting 105 beehives and five million bees.  
However, the economic benefits of this symbiotic relationship hadn’t been quantified until this UK study. Mindful of the cost of installing and managing the beehives, the research team utilized detailed land cover maps to compare solar park locations with crop distributions, as well as existing honeybee hive data, pollination requirements and crop values to determine that honeybee deployment on solar parks could have raised crop yields by £5.9 million in 2017 alone. 
Among UK nations, England was the country that would most benefit from honeybee hive integration, mainly because oilseed is so widely cropped. However, the researchers also looked at crops of field beans, linseed, pears, apples, strawberries, blackcurrants and raspberries, and found that the soft fruits like berries would benefit the most on a per capita basis. 
The field crop yields were found to benefit by £2.6 million, while top fruits such as those used to make cider would see a boost of £1.3 million and soft fruits £1.9 million. 
Ultimately, and it is, of course, a hypothetical (albeit an instructive one), the report found that if all UK crops were grown within a 1.5km radius of a honeybee hive housed solar park, the value of those crop yields could increase by £80 million each year. 
“Our study demonstrates how multi-disciplinary research can find novel land management practices,” said one of the study’s co-authors, Simon Potts of the University of Reading, “which can simultaneously benefit energy producers, farmers, beekeepers and consumers.”
