State Energy Minister Matt Kean said the response to the Registration of Interest (ROI) process showed huge investor confidence in the state’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap, with more than four times the level of interest needed to build out the planned 8 GW REZ.
“The New England REZ is expected to deliver around $10.7 billion in investment and around 830 operational jobs, as well as 1,250 construction jobs each year, all while putting downward pressure on electricity prices and providing landowners with new income streams,” Kean said.
“The overwhelming response shows this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to attract enormous investment into regional areas, cementing NSW’s renewable energy future.”
The New England REZ is one of five designated clean energy areas detailed in the NSW Government’s electricity roadmap, which will support more than $32 billion of investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission in the state.
REZs will also be developed in the South-West, Hunter-Central Coast, Illawarra and Central-West Orana regions and are expected to bring 12 GW of renewable energy and 2 GW of storage online.

The Central-West Orana REZ, which is tipped to deliver 3 GW of renewable energy, was the first of the REZs to be launched with the call for registrations of interest last year attracting 113 registrations, totalling 27 GW and valued at $38 billion.
Kean said the interest in the Central-West Orana REZ had triggered an adjustment from the state government which has committed to investing $78.9 million to support the development of the New England REZ which is set to become Australia’s largest.
“The nine-fold level of interest in the Central-West Orana REZ was astounding, so it makes absolute sense to go even bigger with the New England REZ,” he said.
“The New England REZ will be able to power 3.5 million homes and, when coupled with Central-West Orana REZ, sets the state up to become the number one destination across Australia for renewable energy investment.”
Member for Northern Tablelands Adam Marshall said the ROI process had netted a much larger catch of potential projects than expected and put the local community in the box seat when it came to the final design and planning of the New England REZ.
“With this level of interest, we have the luxury of supporting only the best projects that benefit the community, maintain the highest and strictest development standards and maximise local renewable jobs and investment in the region,” he said.
“We won’t be compromising our standards and now we are in the box seat, so we can be even more discerning, which is great.
“By coordinating REZ development in a strategic way, we can control our own destiny, making sure the projects we host work for our community, not just developers.”

The New England REZ, centred around the Northern Tablelands city of Armidale, will deliver up to 8 GW of new transmission capacity.
The region is close to the existing high voltage power lines that connect the NSW east coast and Queensland, providing opportunities to increase the state’s own energy resilience and to export excess energy to Queensland.
While investor interest is strong, the government said it will take a number of years to plan and deliver the New England REZ which will be built in stages.
The ROI is the first step in engaging industry on the New England REZ and will help inform the next stage of design, including crucial input for the REZ’s staged delivery and network design.
The government-owned EnergyCo will use the information to inform the next stage with participation in the REZ to be determined through a competitive tender process. The first auctions of capacity and positions in the various REZs are expected to begin in 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/27/monash-launches-toolbox-to-aid-rollout-of-microgrid-technology/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 27, 2021",Monash launches ‘toolbox’ to aid rollout of microgrid technology,"Renewable energy experts at Monash University have unveiled an online resource to facilitate the rollout of microgrid technology, declaring the Microgrid Electricity Market Operator (MEMO) toolbox comprises a step-by-step guide on how to develop a microgrid, from planning to operations, and avoid barriers to uptake.
Monash University chief operating officer Peter Marshall said the MEMO toolbox builds on lessons learned during the development of the university’s Clayton campus microgrid which combines 1 MW of rooftop solar PV with a 1 MWh battery energy storage system combining vanadium flow and lithium-ion technology.
“Through our work on microgrids, we know that there are barriers to uptake related to complexity and choice,” he said.
“Using our own operations, lived experience, research and development, and education capability, this toolbox is the first step in showcasing the role microgrids can play in helping to achieve net zero, and addresses barriers to the broader implementation of microgrids.”
The $7.1 million Clayton campus microgrid project, which was launched in 2018, has grown to connect 20 campus buildings and features Australia’s largest commercial behind-the-meter battery storage system – a hybrid system combining a 180 kW/900 kWh vanadium redox flow battery system and a 120 kW/120 kWh lithium-ion battery.
The grid-connected smart embedded network allows the integration of local electricity demand and supply with the broader energy network and is part of the university’s effort to reach net zero emissions by 2030.
Net Zero Initiative program director Scott Ferraro said the project provides useful insights and the MEMO toolbox allows for that knowledge to shared, helping guide precincts, businesses and communities through the process.
“It aims to provide a starting point for businesses and communities to understand the steps required to assess if a microgrid is right for them, how they can develop a business case to secure investment, and how they can work within the current regulatory framework,” he said.
The toolbox launch follows last month’s announcement that the university had been granted almost $2 million as part of the federal government’s Regional and Remote Microgrid Reliability Fund to assess the feasibility of implementing microgrids in six regional Victoria communities.
Monash will identify two communities from each of the Surf Coast, Yarra Ranges and Wodonga areas and will develop a business case for microgrids by demonstrating how they can reduce emissions, improve energy reliability and reduce energy costs.
Each microgrid will aim to virtually connect one business and approximately 20 homes into a microgrid including local renewable generation and energy storage.
“This project …aims to bring the community together to build resilience, increase the use of assets and help reduce energy costs,” Ferraro said.
“Community involvement will be key to the success of these projects, as it will ensure local needs and preferences are factored into the design and commercial models of the proposed microgrid system.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/27/origin-teams-with-japanese-energy-giant-on-green-hydrogen-project/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 27, 2021",Origin teams with Japanese energy giant on green hydrogen project,"Australian energy utility Origin Energy and Japanese energy giant Eneos have announced they will jointly explore the feasibility of producing green hydrogen made with wind and solar energy in Queensland. They will also look at establishing a supply chain including exporting green hydrogen from Australia to Japan.
The study will examine the potential for the stable supply of green hydrogen produced from renewable energy in Queensland. It will also explore the feasibility of converting it to methylcyclohexane (MCH), which fixes hydrogen with toluene and remains in a liquid form at normal temperature and pressure for storage and transportation.
The study will examine what existing infrastructure and transport options can be used and what gaps need to be filled along the supply chain to establish a large-scale green hydrogen business in Queensland.
Origin will focus on the use of renewable energy supply and electrolysis for hydrogen production while Eneos, which earlier this year announced it would develop a 204 MW solar farm in western Queensland in partnership with fellow Japanese company Sojitz, will be responsible for more efficient production of MCH and the transporting of it from Australia to Japan.
Eneos, which holds about 50% market share of petrol sales in Japan, already owns petroleum tankers, storage tanks and refineries used for export, which are expected to be used as the hydrogen supply chain develops.

Eneos, which earlier this month announced plans to conduct a study in partnership with French renewables company Neoen into the potential construction of a green hydrogen supply chain launching from South Australia, said it chose Queensland for its latest venture due to the state’s proactive government policy on hydrogen, abundant renewable resources and well-established infrastructure.
“Queensland is well advanced in the development of renewable energy sources, particularly solar power,” the company said in a statement.
“The state government is promoting hydrogen industry development leveraging these renewable energy sources. In addition, existing infrastructure such as storage tanks, shipping and port facilities currently used for coal and natural gas can be utilized for hydrogen export.”
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk welcomed the announcement saying the state is in prime position to take advantage of Australia’s nascent green hydrogen industry which is expected to contribute at least $11 billion to the national economy and generate around 7,600 jobs by 2050.
“This is an exciting development for Queensland as we are working hard to develop our sustainable hydrogen industry and leverage the solar resources already developed and to be developed in the future,” she said.
The announcement of the Eneos partnership comes just weeks after Origin signed a Memorandum of Understanding with global shipping company Mitsui O.S.K. Lines to investigate opportunities to develop the supply chain to support export-scale green ammonia in Australia.
Origin and MOL will explore how Australian green ammonia projects could supply key downstream markets from 2026, with a joint feasibility study aiming to be completed by December 2021.
Origin is also exploring the potential for a 500 MW electrolyser at Bell Bay, Tasmania, saying its $3.2 million feasibility study into green ammonia production is well progressed.
Origin’s general manager of future fuels, Tracey Boyes, said the energy utility is progressing a number of export-scale green hydrogen opportunities across Australia to meet overseas and domestic demand for lower carbon fuels.
“Many nations have committed to ambitious carbon targets,” she said.
“With our abundance of renewable resources and proximity to Asian markets, Australia is in the box seat to develop a world-leading hydrogen sector, exporting low emissions energy all over the world to meet demand for clean energy from our major trading partners.
“Origin is in a strong position to leverage our expertise in LNG export and delivering complex major projects.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/27/gravity-based-renewable-energy-storage-tower-for-grid-scale-operations/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 27, 2021",Gravity-based renewable energy storage tower for grid-scale operations,"From pv magazine USA
Energy Vault, maker of the EVx gravitational energy storage tower, has secured US$100 million (AU$137 million) in series C funding. The investment was led by Prime Movers Lab, with additional participation from SoftBank, Saudi Aramco, Helena, and Idealab X.
The company said capital raised will support plans to ramp up deployments of the EVx platform for customers in the U.S., Middle East, Europe, and Australia. The first U.S. deployments are slated to begin fourth quarter 2021, with a broader global ramp-up throughout 2022, said Energy Vault.
The EVx platform is a six-arm crane tower designed to be charged by grid-scale renewable energy. It lifts large bricks using electric motors, thereby creating gravitational energy. When power needs to be discharged back to the grid, the bricks are lowered, harvesting the kinetic energy.
There is zero degradation in the storage capacity of the raised composite blocks, which can remain in the raised position for unlimited periods of time, said Energy Vault.
Energy Vault said the composite blocks are made of local soils, as well as materials otherwise destined for landfills or incinerators, including recycled coal ash, waste tailings from mining operations, and wind turbine blades.
In 2020, Energy Vault had the first commercial-scale deployment of its energy storage system and launched the new EVx platform this past April.
The company said the EVx tower features 80-85% round-trip efficiency and over 35 years of technical life. It has a scalable modular design up to multiple gigawatt-hours in storage capacity.
The company said its technology can economically serve both higher power/shorter duration applications with ancillary services from 2 to 4 hours and can also scale to serve longer-duration requirements from 5 to 24 hours or more.
With global lithium supply considered a constraint, and, according to the Biden administration, a national security issue, alternative measures are being taken to find ways to store solar and wind energy.
For example, Form Energy of Somerville, Massachusetts, has secured US$240 million (AU$330 million) in series D funding for its iron-air batteries, which use iron pellets. The pellets are exposed to oxygen to create rust. The oxygen then is removed, reverting the rust to iron. Controlling this process allows the batteries to be charged and discharged.

Grid connection delays to two utility scale projects in Australia partially offset raised second-quarter revenue reported by Dutch solar developer Photon Energy Group.
The Amsterdam-based company posted an €869,000 (AU$1.4 million) loss for the second quarter, down from a €969,000 (AU$1.57 million) reverse a year earlier, and blamed rising interest costs associated with refinancing its latest solar projects in Hungary, as well as the two plants in Leeton, in the Australian state of New South Wales. The Australian sites have a combined generation capacity of 14.6 MW.
Those grid delays, and recruitment as part of a planned expansion drive, partially offset a 16% year-on-year rise in revenue from the sale of electricity, which pushed up the total revenue figure 11%, by the same comparison, to €9.86 million (AU$16 million) for the April-to-June window.
With Photon reporting it has added around 187 MWp of generation capacity in its core European markets of Hungary, Romania and Poland since December, the company bolstered its finances by issuing 5 million shares in a €7.7 million (AU$12 million) fundraising exercise.
