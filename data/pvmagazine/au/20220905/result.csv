Countrywide, a wholly owned subsidiary of Queensland-based independent power producer ReNu Energy, has two projects under development in Tasmania; one at Bell Bay near George Town in the north, and the second at Brighton near Hobart in the south.
The Bell Bay project proposes a 10 MW facility capable of producing 4.5 tonnes of green hydrogen per day with Countrywide targeting the domestic market, including the road transport sector and industrial customers.
The 2 MW Brighton project, to be located about a 30-minute drive north of Hobart, would be capable of producing up to 900 kilograms of green hydrogen per day, supplying Hobart’s natural gas network as well as industrial and transport customers.
ReNu Energy executive director and Countrywide managing director Geoffrey Drucker said on Monday that under the agreement Wirsol will evaluate each project location to determine the optimum-sized solar PV facility and the potential to add battery energy storage to provide Countrywide with the lowest cost energy for hydrogen production.
Drucker said with renewable hydrogen production via electrolysis relying on only two inputs, electricity and water, minimising the cost of power will allow Countrywide to deliver the lowest hydrogen supply price to encourage potential customers to embrace the transition from fossil fuels like diesel and natural gas to emission-free hydrogen.
“To that end, behind-the-meter electricity generation will deliver the lowest cost of hydrogen with solar being the most viable option in terms of installation timing and capex,” he said.
Drucker said Wirsol, which operates and maintains seven large-scale solar PV assets in Australia with a combined capacity of more than 720 MW, and has a development pipeline of ~700MW, would also examine the potential of establishing green hydrogen production facilities alongside its existing solar assets.

“We reached out to Wirsol to determine their interest in co-developing behind-the-meter solar to hydrogen projects from two perspectives,” he said. “One is to assist us with our renewable hydrogen projects in Tasmania and the other is to determine where it may be feasible to co-locate hydrogen production facilities on Wirsol’s established solar farms throughout Australia.”
Wirsol managing director Sigi Psutka said the company, a subsidiary of Germany-based renewable energy group Wircon, would look to be the among the first in the field to integrate new technologies like on-site hydrogen production and trading.
“We are delighted to partner with Countrywide and be conducting the initial assessments of the projects in Tasmania,” he said.
Countrywide said as well as the Tasmanian projects, it is also developing two renewable hydrogen projects in Victoria. The company’s vision is to be a major green hydrogen supplier domestically, with a primary focus on supplying hydrogen to the mobility and natural gas sectors, and then to use its Australian learnings to expand to export and offshore projects.
Wirsol, which has established itself as a major player since entering the Australian market in March 2017, continues to roll out large-scale solar projects.
Only last month the company announced it had secured development approval for a 445 MW solar and energy storage hybrid power plant to be built near Dubbo in New South Wales’ central west. It is also progressing plans to develop the 75-85 MW Barnawartha Solar Farm west of Wodonga in Victoria.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/05/44-million-boost-to-accelerate-pumped-hydro-energy-storage/,"ENERGY STORAGE,PUMPED HYDRO,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2022",$44 million boost to accelerate pumped hydro energy storage,"The New South Wales (NSW) government has announced a $44.8 million funding package for five pumped hydro projects with a combined capacity of almost 1.75 GW and 60 hours of storage as it looks to accelerate the development of long-duration storage to help manage the forecast closure of coal-fired power plants in the coming years.
The state government said funding agreements are already in place with developers of hydro projects in the New England, Hunter Valley, Central Tablelands, Southern Highlands and South Coast regions with the monies to help cover private investment barriers and upfront costs.
NSW Treasurer and Energy Minister Matt Kean said the funding will go towards pre-investment activities, including feasibility studies and developing business cases for the projects.
“NSW has the most ambitious renewable energy policy in the nation, which is needed to replace ageing coal-fired power stations and build a clean energy future for NSW,” he said.
With four of the state’s five remaining coal-fired generators scheduled for retirement between 2023 and 2035, and more variable renewable energy entering the market, NSW has a target to build at least 2 GW of new long-duration storage by 2030 to maintain system reliability and security.

Kean said pumped hydro – which acts like a giant battery by using surplus renewable energy to pump water up a hill and releasing it back down the hill through giant turbines that create electricity on demand – is a key component of the state’s renewable energy plans, providing clean, reliable power and creating infrastructure jobs right across regional NSW.
“If these pumped hydro projects proceed to construction, they are expected to create more than 2,300 jobs and attract $4.4 billion of private investment, which will help grow the economy and support the regions,” he said.
Kean said the funding, given as part of the NSW Pumped Hydro Recoverable Grants Program, will be repaid to the government if a project reaches a financial close, and could be reinvested into future projects.
Among the projects to receive grant funding is the Oven Mountain pumped hydro energy storage project being developed near Armidale in the New England region. If built it has the potential to provide 600 MW of electricity with about 12 hours of storage duration.
The list also includes EnergyAustralia’s Lake Lyell project (335MW, 8 hours) being developed near Lithgow, Atco’s Central West pumped storage hydro project (325 MW, 8 hours) being developed near Yetholme, and Origin Energy’s Shoalhaven hydro expansion (235 MW, 24 hours) near Bowral on the south coast.

The proposed Muswellbrook pumped hydro project being developed at the old Muswellbrook coal mine site in the Hunter Valley has also secured funding. The proposed project, being developed by AGL in collaboration with Idemitsu Australia, will see an existing coal mine void transformed into a 250 MW pumped hydro site with eight hours of storage capacity.
AGL chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said the funding will enable the project to advance development studies to a stage that means the project is ready for investment.
“As we transition to more renewable energy sources, pumped hydro provides a reliable on-demand generation source and acceleration of our development studies will help us understand how the project could be delivered,” he said.
NSW has a target to build at least 2 GW of new long-duration storage by the end of the decade, and has committed $97.5 million to accelerate pumped hydro projects that could meet that target. This includes funding for private projects as well as funding to undertake site investigations for pumped hydro potential on existing WaterNSW dams.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/05/sundrive-hits-efficiency-high-with-copper-based-solar-cell-technology/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2022",SunDrive achieves 26.41% efficiency with copper-based solar cell technology,"SunDrive has achieved an efficiency result of 26.41% on a full-size silicon heterojunction (HJT) solar cell featuring the company’s copper-based technology using large-scale production processes provided by China-headquartered equipment manufacturer Maxwell Technologies.
Sydney-based SunDrive said the result, which improves upon the 26.07% efficiency mark the company announced earlier this year, has been officially verified by the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin (ISFH) in Germany.
The company said improvement of the HJT cell, with a total area of 274.3cm2 (M6 size), had been observed in all three key performance parameters including open-circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Isc) and fill factor (FF), attributing the improvements to “several equipment and processing upgrades”.
SunDrive said Maxwell’s latest generation chemical vapor deposition (CVD) equipment incorporates bifacial microcrystalline silicon layer deposition, further improving the rear-side passivation and contact resistance. In addition, more transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers were applied using Maxwell’s latest physical vapor deposition (PVD) coating equipment.
SunDrive said fabricating the solar cell electrodes using the company’s copper plating technology rather than traditional silver screen printing had also played a key role in the efficiency improvements. SunDrive, which replaces the silver used in conventional solar cells with the cheaper and more abundant copper, said it has refined its copper plating chemistry and processing sequence, achieving feature sizes of less than 10 µm with an aspect ratio close to one.

“What we have shown is that copper can effectively take silver’s place on these next-generation solar cell structures, but more importantly, efficiencies can be further increased beyond levels attainable with silver,” the company said.
With solar PV set to play a major role in the world’s transition to a clean energy future, SunDrive co-founder Vince Allen said copper is the key to unlocking the floodgates of more efficient solar cell structures and its use in place of silver could allow solar technology to reach its full potential.
“The solar cells that will provide the majority of the world’s future energy needs will be vastly different to the solar cells we have today,” he said. “Efficiency, cost and material scalability are fundamental for continued growth in solar adoption.
“Copper is around 100 times cheaper per kilogram and around 1,000 times more abundant than silver. And aside from the abundancy and cost benefits of copper, we have found we can improve the efficiency above and beyond what is attainable with silver.”

SunDrive will now push ahead with plans to establish a pilot production line by mid-2023, with scale up to market entry later in the year.
While no location has been identified for the planned production facility, Allen said Australia has many of the ingredients required to host a solar manufacturing industry.
“We recognise that countries are increasingly competing in this space, however with the right policy setting, Australia has the potential to be a global solar manufacturing powerhouse,” he said.
“We have the need – we have the fastest growing rooftop solar market in the world and Australia will likely also be home to the five largest solar farms in the next decade. We have the people – many of the world’s top solar executives, scientists and engineers were trained at Australian universities and we have the ability, today’s commercial solar cells were invented here in Australia and Australia has held the efficiency world record for 30 of the last 40 years.”
Allen said the nation is also blessed with resources deemed critical for the clean energy transition.
“Australia is in the top three for global reserves of every major mineral required to make a solar panel which no other country can claim,” he said. “Australia also likely has the greatest opportunity of any country to not just reach net zero but to help other countries reach net zero – it is the sunniest and windiest continent in the world with an extremely large land mass and very low population density.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/05/hydrogen-bromide-flow-battery-for-large-scale-renewables-storage/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2022",Hydrogen bromide flow battery for large-scale renewables storage,"From pv magazine Global
Elestor, a startup based in the Netherlands, has secured €30 million (AU$44 million) in funding from a consortium of lenders led by Norwegian energy producer Equinor.
It will use the funds to further develop its hydrogen bromide (HBr) flow battery technology for renewable energy storage. The company plans to build a gigawatt-scale production facility at an unspecified location.
“We are also building the first commercial system as we speak,” said Elestor CEO Guido Dalessi. “The first customers are large corporates, adopting Elestor technology on a strategic basis. Their demand grows to serious production capacities and that will reduce the manufacturing cost very fast. Technically speaking, we are there in terms of lifetime and efficiency, but we need to bring this technology to series production in order to further reduce the production costs, and along with that, the levelised cost of storage (LCOS).”
In the proposed system configuration, HBr works as the system’s electrolyte. The system assembles a large number of Elestor’s electrochemical single cells connected in series. The membrane surface area determines the power of the system and the tank volumes determine the capacity. According to the manufacturer, both can be designed independently, in any desired combination.
During the charging phase, HBr is split into hydrogen ions and bromide ions. The hydrogen ions cross then the membrane, absorb an electron, and are stored as hydrogen gas in a separate tank. The resulting bromine (Br2) is then dissolved in the same tank as the HBr.
During the discharging phase, hydrogen is recombined with bromine forming HBr again, and the stored energy is then released.
“Our HBr flow battery combines electrolyser and fuel cell functionality with one single membrane,” Dalessi said. “The discharge processes do not suffer from degradation and the system is self-contained with no emissions. After around 10,000 cycles, the stack modules can be replaced, while the system itself including active materials remains unchanged. With new stacks, the system is given a full second life.”
The manufacturer claims the system has a depth of discharge of 100% and a round-trip efficiency ranging from 65% to 75%. The containerised version has a power output of 200 kW and a storage capacity of 2,000 kWh. Each cube container measures 12.2 m x 2.4 m x 2.9 m and has a gross weight of 42 tons.
Dalessi claims the battery could potentially achieve an LCOS lower than US$0.05/kW.
“Scaling and automating production is one of the main reasons to enter this investment round,” he said. “Potentially, the LCoS of the Elestor technology can be far lower than for instance lithium-ion storage, especially when it concerns long-duration storage applications. All these claims, like on LCoS, have been extensively challenged in detail during the investment round by external advisers to the investors. Apart from the financials, another result of successfully closing this investment round is that the Elestor technology, proposition and organisation have implicitly been validated.”
