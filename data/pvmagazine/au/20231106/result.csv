This represents more than 10 times the $120 million available under the program’s opening round of funding.
ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said the unprecedented demand highlights the significant opportunities for shared local energy storage to store excess solar energy for later use, easing pressure on the local electricity grid.
“Through these initial projects we hope to see community batteries enable cheaper, cleaner energy storage to communities and provide valuable knowledge that can be shared across Australia to fast-track the implementation of these local batteries,” Miller said.
ARENA opened the first round of the community batteries funding program in April. The agency said 31 applications, representing a total grant request of $231 million and total project value of $530 million, have now been shortlisted and invited to submit full applications.
Shortlisted applicants must install a minimum of five community batteries, between 50 kW and 5 MW in size each and connect to the local grid as front-of-meter devices.
The federal government has allocated $200 million to deploy 400 community batteries across Australia. ARENA has been appointed to manage the funding program and will select the remaining 342 projects after the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) approved the first 58 community batteries through the Business Grants Hub.
The second of those initial 58 batteries is now online with Ausgrid commissioning a 412 kWh battery at Narara on the NSW Central Coast.

Ausgrid Chief Executive Officer Marc England said the battery will increase capacity for local rooftop solar as well as support energy security and grid reliability.
England said community batteries are uniquely placed to address the local challenges of higher peak demand and the hollowing out of system demand during the day; supporting the network during peak times and avoiding the need for network augmentation that would otherwise be necessary to address grid constraints.
“We are confident community batteries of all sizes attached to the distribution network will play a vital role in supporting our energy transition to 100% renewables,” he said.
“Ultimately, as we continue to work toward making these batteries a viable storage as a service solution, the community will receive greater benefit, while greening the grid.”
The Narara community battery is Ausgrid’s second community battery installed as part of the federal government funding program.
In September, it commissioned at 412 kWh neighborhood battery in Cabarita, Western Sydney. The Cabarita battery reportedly stores power from 50 households with rooftop solar and shares electricity with approximately 150 households.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/06/queensland-hydro-heads-underground-with-48-gwh-pumped-hydro-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,PUMPED HYDRO,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 6, 2023",Queensland Hydro heads underground with 48 GWh pumped hydro project,"State-owned company Queensland Hydro has opened the expressions of interest (EOI) process for the underground works – tunnel drilling package for the proposed $14.2 billion (USD 9.25 billion) Borumba pumped hydro energy storage project being developed near Gympie in the state’s southeast.
Queensland Hydro Chief Executive Officer Kieran Cusack said the EOI marks a new stage of the exploratory works phase for the Borumba project, the first of two large-scale pumped hydro energy storage projects planned by the Queensland government as part of its coal-fired power exit strategy.
“We’re excited about this release because it’s the first major package of works since we launched our industry engagement program in July,” Cusack said. “We’ve been working with industry to ensure we attract the best partners for the project while creating opportunities for local industry involvement.”
The Borumba pumped hydro project involves expanding an existing lower reservoir and creating a new dam at a higher altitude, connected by an underground power station. Water will be pumped to the upper dam during periods of surplus renewable energy and low demand, and then released back to generate electricity during times of high demand.
The underground works package will involve the excavation of soil and rock to form a tunnel leading to the proposed site of the underground powerhouse cavern.
The tunnelling will allow Queensland Hydro to gather geological, geotechnical and hydrogeological data to confirm the proposed location for the underground powerhouse and transformers caverns.
Queensland Hydro said data gathered during the tunnelling operation will compliment surface geological investigations, helping to inform detailed design of the project and how it is best delivered. If the project proceeds, the tunnel will likely be repurposed to become one of the access tunnels required in the project design.
Prospective suppliers are encouraged to submit their EOIs prior to 4 December 2023 with the contract to be awarded in August 2024 with work set to commence in November 2024.
Construction of the project proper is scheduled to begin by 2025 with first power targeted in 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/06/why-true-zero-carbon-is-the-right-side-of-history/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,QUALITY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",,"NOVEMBER 6, 2023",Why True Zero carbon is the right side of history,"In Australia, 35% of our electricity is currently from renewable sources. Yet some consumers claim their energy to be 100% renewable. How is that? 
It’s done by separating the sale of electricity from the sale of its characteristics – particularly the characteristic of ‘being renewable.’ A certificate is created for each MWh of energy produced by a qualifying renewable generator, and these certificates are sold entirely independently of the energy itself. 
So buyers of these certificates figure out how much energy they consume on an annual basis and buy an equivalent number of certificates, allowing them to claim that all the energy they used was renewable. However, it means that there are fewer certificates left for the rest of the market, so everyone else’s percentage renewable claim is that much less.  Let’s be clear, buying certificates is paying money to take credit for renewable energy that other people used.  It’s called Net Zero, and it’s time it was called out.
In 2018, a small group of Google engineers did just that, calling bullshit on the company’s claim of 100% renewable energy. By running the numbers on the wind energy matched to their data centre in Iowa they demonstrated that only 61% was sourced from clean energy. Despite their 100% clean energy claim their matched energy supplies fell 39% short, and came from burning fossil fuels.

Google reframed their ambition to 24/7 Carbon Free Energy every hour of the year for all their operations and data centres globally. This new higher standard would challenge the company as it transforms its energy procurement and daily operations to meet this higher objective by 2030.  
Only 100% transparency of the clean energy source and time it is generated gives us the information we need to accelerate driving down emissions and remain on track for the max 1.5°C temperature rise we aspire to. 
While Google takes on this global decarbonisation challenge for themselves, we can play a role through our actions at work and at home. Being prepared to measure and manage our own daily energy choices can contribute to the slowing of carbon emissions into the atmosphere, and can do so at a lower cost in most electricity markets around the world. Transparency builds trust and trust builds momentum for change. 
How fast is fast enough?
The next ten years are critical.
Broadly speaking we have three paths: Fast, Slow and BAU.
McKinsey & Company
The McKinsey chart clearly illustrates the three path options, adapted here for illustrative purposes.
The ‘business as usual’ (BAU) Path chooses to ignore the consequences of continuing to rely on fossil fuels in our energy mix. Remaining on the BAU Path is the historical trend line making life on earth potentially untenable.
The Slow Path encourages us to believe we have time and supports the idea that Net Zero will get us where we need to be by 2050. The Slow Path is locked in an outdated paradigm of offsets and paper certificates that suggests action to an adequate energy transition. In reality this path is untenable, and as the Google analysts showed, it lacks transparency and therefore accountability. 
The Fast Path achieves rapid transition by adopting electricity as our single energy source, and introducing transparency, traceability and accountability so that we can progress faster, measure our progress, and course correct where we need. It makes organisations and governments accountable and gives users the information they need to make sound choices around energy use and source. 
What does a transparent fast path look like?
The Fast Path focuses on the clean electrons, bringing transparency to where carbon-free energy is being generated and consumed across the grid. The Fast Path allows us all to measure and manage our clean energy consumption upward and march fossil fuels out of our mix. Our daily climate emergency headlines reinforce the limited time we have to act. The Fast Path is a shorter journey to True Zero. 
Electricity as our primary energy source is the focus for the Fast Path. In round figures energy is responsible for 75% of global emissions, when we include transport.  Clean energy is the biggest lever we have to hold the line on 1.5 degrees. This is why our focus needs to be on electrifying everything, our grids, buildings and our transport, in the energy transition.

This level of transparency set Google on the Fast Path. This level of transparency meant they could see and measure where electrons were coming from. As a result, they reframed their ambition to power all data centres and operations with ‘true zero’ clean energy 24/7, every day of the year.  Google is choosing the Fast Path.
In the absence of tracing technology, business and government have used a combination of offsets to match against their annual emissions. Offsets have allowed advocates for Net Zero (the Slow Path) to craft a narrative that the energy transition is cheap and easy.
The narrative recognises companies emit carbon emissions during the year, these carbon emissions are totalled up and offset against a range of low-cost renewable certificates and carbon offsets. Total emissions are matched to offsets on paper and achieve a nice round 100% number. 
Why is it a problem?  I believe the core of the issue is the false conflation of this financial incentive system with actual measurement of renewable energy consumption.  Purchasers of certificates and GreenPower are led to believe that they have hit the goal of zero carbon, but it was at the (carbon) cost of everyone else. And worryingly it leads to these net zero buyers dusting off their hands and declaring “job done.”  But the job’s not done. The carbon output gets shuffled around on paper as part of the company accounting, but the underlying goal of reducing carbon emissions is not nearly as successful as we need it to be
And, by definition, we can’t all get to net zero. Net zero means paying money to take the credit for renewable energy or carbon reductions somebody else actually used.  So how does that ‘somebody else’ get to net zero? It just kicks the can down the road a bit further and ultimately delays what we are really aiming for – a true zero carbon society.
So why did we do it? In a word, money. The sale of certificates goes to fund the development of new renewable generators.  It’s an entirely admirable objective, but it’s past its use-by date. The certificate system began 25 years ago when renewables like solar and wind farms needed strong subsidies to compete with coal and gas. In the past quarter century however two things have changed.  Firstly, the cost of solar and wind generation has dramatically fallen, becoming the lowest cost form of new generation. Secondly, all the power plants built since 1998 are still eligible for certificates, hugely watering down the impact of certificate purchases today. 
The net zero Slow Path limitations are also starting to show signs of risk. Net zero champions advocate for the benefits of ‘additionality,’ only invest in new solar and wind projects and use Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to prove the carbon free energy generation. In principle this approach seems to make sense, if we need more clean energy in the grid, why not fund additional renewables in the dirtiest grid and get more carbon bang for our buck? In the Slow Path framework companies seek to offset their emissions by buying RECs from clean energy generated in other markets, at a lower cost. ‘Additionality’ has morphed into ‘emissionality’ and supports the development of projects outside the grid where the energy is being consumed.
Fast, Slow and BAU frameworks bring transparency to the energy transition allowing consumers to choose a path and be measured by it. If you or your organisation are doing nothing active about your energy consumption, you’re in denial. Without paying attention to the source of the energy you’re consuming, you may be unwittingly supporting the fossil fuel industry to extend its lifetime beyond the necessary transition, and socialise the cost of carbon emissions. This is a debt society will pay for dearly as our planet continues to break global temperature records month on month. If you’re buying certificates or GreenPower to sleep better at night, you may find yourself on the wrong side of history. 
Ask your electricity retailer how much clean energy they are buying to match your electricity consumption, and then ask for it to be matched hour by hour. By choosing the Fast Path, by measuring and managing clean electricity entering the grid, time matched to the load in your buildings and transport, your path will stand the test of time. Your choice to buy clean energy from solar and wind farms, and big batteries charged by renewables, will be vindicated as short-term higher costs are rewarded by the long-term lower cost of clean energy.
True Zero is achievable, it’s now a question of choice. For each and every one of us, the question of which path we choose will determine which side of history we’re on. Why not ask the questions, take the Fast Path and you will find collaborators seeking to make a difference and accelerate the energy transition.

Fortescue had planned to build a renewable energy hub comprising a 3.33 GW solar farm and 2.04 GW wind farm backed by 9.1 GWh of battery energy storage on an 10,000-hectare site approximately 120 kilometres south of the coastal town of Onslow.
Fortescue lodged environmental documents with the EPA early last year but the authority has now confirmed that the company terminated the approvals process midway through last month.
The project had been identified as a critical component of the company’s plan to decarbonise its mining operations in Western Australia by 2030.
Fortescue, which estimates its mining operations generate more than 2.5 million tonnes of carbon equivalent each year, has forecast it will need to deploy an additional 2 GW to 3 GW of renewable energy generation and battery storage to decarbonise its operations by the end of the decade.
In a presentation to analysts and investors last month, Fortescue outlined plans to build more than 1 GW of solar, about 1 GW of wind energy, and about 4 GWh of battery storage to eliminate gas and diesel from its mining operations.
The company said one 60 MW solar farm has already been built at Chichester by Alinta, and construction of a 100 MW solar farm at North Star Junction, near its Iron Bridge magnetite operations, is nearing completion and two small battery projects are well advanced.

“The construction of a purpose-built facility will help solve global supply constraints of high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) subsea cables,” the company said in a statement. “Currently, all advanced HVDC subsea cable facilities are located in the Northern Hemisphere.”
Sun Cable said the growing hub of Bell Bay, an industrial centre about 50 kilometres north of Launceston, has been chosen due to its deep-water port facilities, access to rail transport links and renewable energy infrastructure.
The proposed Bell Bay facility is to include manufacturing and testing workshops, a customised port facility as well as a 180-200 metre vertical extrusion tower needed for construction of the cables. The company has estimated the facility will typically use about 25 MW to 40 MW of renewable energy for the manufacturing process.
Sun Cable said if the manufacturing facility is approved, construction is scheduled to commence in 2025 with the first cables available in 2029, supporting the development of the company’s estimated $35 billion (USD 22.78 billion) AAPowerLink project.
The AAPowerLink project includes building up to 20 GW of solar and 42 GWh of battery energy storage on a 12,000-hectare site at Powell Creek in the Northern Territory’s Barkly region. The company aims to deliver up to 800 MW of renewable energy into Darwin via an 800 km overhead transmission line with the rest to be exported to Singapore through Indonesia via a 4,300 km submarine transmission link.
Sun Cable Chief Projects Officer Chris Tyrrell said the use of high voltage subsea cables over long distances has a critical role to play in the global clean energy transition and will be key to solving the transmission of green electrons within and between countries.
“Australia has an abundance of sunshine and wind. HVDC cable enables the export of this natural resource to the world, establishing Australia as a renewable energy superpower as well as an advanced manufacturing hub for critical supply chains,” he said.
While the Bell Bay manufacturing facility remains subject to regulatory approvals, Tasmania Premier Jeremy Rockliff welcomed Sun Cable’s announcement, saying the project has the potential to significantly boost the state’s economy.
“A project of this size could create over 800 construction jobs, and over 400 long-term advanced manufacturing roles across a diverse range of trades, skills and capabilities,” he said.
The government has forecast the facility would inject more than $1 billion in economic activity to Tasmania during construction and up to $350 million annually at full operations.
The unveiling of the plans for the cable manufacturing facility follows the recent announcement from Sun Cable backer Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners that it is looking to fund and develop a major polysilicon manufacturing plant in north Queensland as part of plans to establish alternate supply chains for the solar and battery products it purchases.

Scientists from Egypt have developed a new software for PV system sizing that reportedly offers users information about the tradeoffs between system reliability and its costs.
Dubbed Green Energy Solutions, the software was developed using C sharp language, with 2023 prices in US dollars for the different system components.
“The new software includes new features not available in other photovoltaic software available in the market, such as the reliability of the system and producing the options to the user to choose the optimum solution according to the reliability, initial cost, and total cost for the lifetime of the project,” the researchers explained.
The software assumes PV modules to have a lifetime of 24 years, with the inverters and the batteries being replaced every 5 and 3 years, respectively.
In its user interface, the program asks the user for a few parameters. First, it asks for the system location to determine the solar radiation throughout the year. The user then needs to decide whether the system is independent or connected to the grid and whether the modules are fixed or use single or double-axis tracking.
The user is also required to choose the load and its profile from three load profiles. “Constant Load means the load is constant 24 hours, 365 days per year,” the scientists explained. “Daily Load means the load is operated from sunrise to sunset every day, 365 days per year; while Night load means that the load is operated from sunset to sunrise every day, 365 days per year.”
Based on those inputs, the system produces several outputs, such as the required size of the PV array, the battery size needed in case of a stand-alone system, and the project’s required surface. It also calculates the cost/kWh generated from the system in US dollars, including loan costs.
“The reliability cost results enable the user to choose the suitable solution for the PV system according to his budget,” the researchers added. “The program illustrates that a slight decrease in reliability will result in a significant system cost reduction. For example, if the reliability is increased from 97.83% to 99.52%, the cost is increased by 88.5%.”
Finally, the research group has compared the monthly kWh/m2 calculated by its program with that calculated by PVsyst, which is a globally popular software package to study, size, simulate, and analyse data from PV systems.
According to their results, Green Energy Solutions’ simulation error margin compared to PVsyst ranged from 1.46% in May to 9.06% in January. In yearly calculation, the novel program was off by 0.44%.
The software was introduced in the article “Developing Techno-economic GUI-based Software for On-grid and Off-grid Photovoltaic Systems Sizing,” published in Ain Shams Engineering Journal. The research group includes scientists from the Ain Shams University, the Misr International Technological University, and the Sadat Academy for Management Sciences.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/06/new-research-suggests-renewables-may-not-necessarily-foster-democracy-peace/,"RESEARCH,GERMANY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 6, 2023","New research suggests renewables may not necessarily foster democracy, peace","From pv magazine Global
A group of researchers led by the University of Erfurt have found that there is “no support” for the widely held belief that renewable energy generation can foster peace and reduce conflict.
“We find no evidence for the ‘peace through prosperity’ argument,” the academics – Juergen Braunstein, Andreas Goldthau and Konstantin Veit – wrote in their published paper.
“Even if states deploy renewables at a large scale, the lack of an ‘energy democracy effect’ suggests they may not necessarily abstain from going to war thanks to embracing distributed energy systems at home.”
Geopolitical experts often argue that renewable energy sources, due to their distributed nature, may lead to global stability. It is suggested that these energy sources can reduce conflicts between nations by either encouraging individual countries to become more self-sufficient or by increasing cooperation between neighboring countries. These nations may find technical and economic advantages in sharing their resources, which may lead to peaceful outcomes.
The three academics put this theory – of peace through prosperous renewable energy generation – to the test by conducting a series of statistical assessments using data from a range of sources. This includes information from Thompson Reuters SDC Platinum, the World Bank’s Varieties of Democracy, the World Bank’s Governance Indicators and the Human Development Index (HDI) of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
“Using a longitudinal dataset on global renewable energy investment, econometric tests suggest that distributed renewable energy systems do not seem to foster democratic rule, nor do they have a significant influence on human development,” the academics stated.
Although the researchers wrote that it is “hard to test” the assertion of the ability of renewables to foster peace and democracy, and more research is required, they found that this ability is impacted by the location and utilization of renewable energy generation plants. “It makes a difference whether renewables are deployed in a conflict-prone setting or a politically stable environment,” they also said.
They also found that clean energies foster peace in areas where renewable investments are “concentrated” rather than distributed. “With this, a core assumption of the energy democracy literature is put in question, that is renewables redistributing power to local communities and individuals, and by extension foster democratic rule at the national level,” the paper stated.
They also found that deploying renewables does not necessarily lead to a country or region’s economic development. “The hypothesis based on the capitalist peace rationale needs to be rejected: as per the statistical test, renewables do not seem to induce development and therefore lower the level and likelihood of conflict,” the paper stated.
Although their research shows that renewables do not have a pacifying effect on democracy or human security, these energy sources may be relevant for peace and stability through other mechanisms. It also may take time to see their long-term impacts, the paper stated.
The researchers published their findings in the paper “Does climate action bring peace? Assessing the geopolitics of renewables using global investment data,” published in npj climate action.
