“We’re excited to be using a Tesla battery for the Beehive Project, a world-renowned company delivering proven big-battery technology,” Enova CEO Felicity Stening said in a statement.
“We expect Megapack, our Queen Bee, to be on the ground in Heddon Greta in the latter half of this year.”
Enova told pv magazine on Thursday the battery is expected to be commissioned in Q3 2021.
The shared community battery project, being developed in conjunction with Sydney-based software firm Enosi and the University of Newcastle, aims to transform how communities use and share rooftop solar energy and large-scale battery storage.
Participating households – with or without rooftop solar installations – will be able to log into the online platform and share and trade rooftop solar energy with each other and with the battery itself.
Stening said because the project allows for virtual participation in the peer-to-peer scheme, it will be able to open the interest to anyone who is an Enova customer across NSW.
“We’re currently inviting solar and non-solar households to register their interest in participating in this project and so far we’ve had around 550 people register their interest,” she said.
“We’ll soon be going through a selection process to identify the 500 participating households.”
Enova has described the Beehive Project as unique, saying smart technology will allow for the stored energy to be distributed amongst households that don’t have to be located close to the battery. The peer-to-peer trading means participating households can access more renewable energy, at a price they can decide on.
“Not only is it a key strategic initiative for Enova, it’s also the first of its kind in Australia,” Stening said. “Projects like this have the potential to change the face of the electricity system as we know it.”
The project has attracted the support of the State Government, having secured almost $1 million in funding as part of the NSW Government’s Regional Community Energy Fund.
Enova will host a Q&A Zoom meeting about Beehive Project at 6pm on February 16. Those interested can register to attend the Q&A on the project webpage at www.enovaenergy.com.au.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/11/wa-liberals-announce-4-5-gw-mega-project-as-part-of-renewable-energy-plan/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 11, 2021",WA Liberals announce 4.5 GW ‘mega project’ as part of renewable energy plan,"At the core of the WA Liberals’ New Energy Jobs Plan is a $9 billion 4.5 GW renewable energy “mega project” encompassing wind and solar energy to be constructed between Geraldton and Shark Bay with the renewable energy converted to green hydrogen for transport to export markets.
Kirkup said the Liberals would also underwrite the development of a 1.5 GW solar and wind energy project in the Mid-West by 2025 by completing a $500 million transmission line extension from Three Springs to Geraldton which would result in zero emissions and renewable electricity powering the South West Interconnected System (SWIS).
The plan also alludes to a 500 MW mega-battery array which would provide grid security.
Kirkup also promised to “lead by example” and deliver zero emissions from the state government by 2030 which is inclusive of the public transport system, state vehicle fleet, and the state-owned electricity network.
Under the plan, state-owned coal-fired power stations in Muja and Collie would be shut by 2025. The current Labor Government has already indicated it will shut two of the four operating generators at the Muja Power Station between 2022 and 2024 but has not outlined when the whole facility may be shuttered.
Kirkup however said transitioning to renewables was a necessary step to ensure the state keeps pace with other countries already making the move around the world.
“I want to make it perfectly clear that this will not impact the private sector. This is about the state government’s emissions and leading by example,” he said.
“Our plan will assist companies transition to green exports and independent clean energy operations – if they choose.
“Coal has been progressively wound down in WA and what we need to do is make sure we have … a plan for the future.
“The Liberal’s New Energy Jobs Plan will help create a renewable energy future not only for our state but for the rest of the country.”
Kirkup, who will look to unseat Premier Mark McGowan in the March 13 state election, said the Liberals’ New Energy Jobs Plan was expected to attract $16 billion worth of public and private capital investment over the coming decade, on top of the $400 million spent by the state.
“It’s a mega-project, building the largest renewable energy project in Australia’s history, with wind, solar and large-scale batteries that will transform Western Australia’s energy system for the next 50 years,” he said.

The plan however flies in the face of the Federal Government’s stance with Prime Minister Scott Morrison continuing to push for new investments in coal while refusing to put a deadline on Australia reaching net-zero emissions.
During a National Press Club address last month Morrison said “our goal is to reach net zero emissions as soon as possible, and preferably by 2050”.
Kirkup said the WA Liberals were not with Morrison who has also said there is decades left for the coal industry.
“We’re not fundamentally at odds at all, the reality is the Prime Minister has set an ambitious target for where Australia needs to be,” he said.
“What we’re saying is that as a state government we have a target now of 2030, that’s for zero emissions for the state government.
“We have natural advantages here that should be exploited, should be utilised to make sure we can transition to net zero.
“We need to take advantage of our state’s natural assets. This is not something that should be difficult to achieve in Western Australia when we have the best possible solar, wind, gas and hydrogen opportunities.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/11/agl-backs-battery-strategy-after-2-9b-first-half-loss/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 11, 2021",AGL backs battery strategy after $2.9b first-half loss,"Sydney-based AGL announced on Thursday a statutory loss after tax of $2.87 billion in its financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2020 (1H21). This includes a pre-tax hit of $1.9 billion in “onerous contracts” – mostly relating to long-term wind farm offtake agreements signed between 2006 and 2012, when the cost of wind energy was significantly higher.
AGL said it expects annual core underlying earnings of between $1.59 billion and $1.85 billion, compared with $2.07 billion a year earlier. Its underlying profit, which omits one-off items, was $317 million for the six months to December 31, down 27% on the same period last year.
“Our 1H21 result reflects the sharp decline in wholesale prices for electricity and large-scale renewable certificates over recent times,” AGL chief executive officer Brett Redman said in a statement.
Redman also pointed to the lower gross margin in wholesale gas, higher costs associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, increased depreciation expense and the $25 million negative impact of the outage at Unit 3 of the Liddell Power Station in December as reasons for the massive write down.
Redman said the results meant the energy generator and retailer is now “actively assessing” its business model and capital structure to support an evolving strategy “as the shaping forces of customer needs, community expectations and technology continue to accelerate”.
This strategy includes plans to add at least 850 MW of new large-scale battery storage to AGL’s portfolio by 2024 as it works towards net-zero emissions by 2050 and new relevance in a renewable-energy-powered world.

“We have continued to make progress with delivering our strategy to become a multi-product retailer and enable the transition of Australia’s energy supply by investing in flexible storage and generation capacity and expanding our decentralised energy activities,” Redman said.
“In customer markets, we recorded strong organic customer service growth and acquired Click Energy, making us Australia’s biggest energy retailer, while the uptake of our new broadband and carbon neutral customer service offerings is exceeding our expectations.
“In integrated energy, we are on track to develop 850 MW of grid-scale batteries and we continue to progress our plans for the Crib Point liquified natural gas (LNG) import project, while we now have more than 100 MW of capacity and 50,000 customers participating in orchestration programs.”
AGL has already made giant strides towards its 850 MW battery storage goal, having announced plans to install a 250 MW battery at its Torrens Island Power Station in South Australia, a 200 MW battery at Victoria’s Loy Yang A power station and a massive 500 MW battery system at its Liddell power plant which is scheduled to close by April 2023.
“While earnings pressures are increasing, we are executing our strategy with discipline, while looking to the future to ensure our business is structured to lead the energy transition,” Redman said.
“We are committed to our position as an essential service provider to our customers and to the Australian community at large.”
“We are on track to deliver $150 million of operating cost reductions, in addition to offsetting inflation, in FY22 and we are targeting a $100 million reduction in sustaining capital expenditure across the company.
While acknowledging it is operating in a “challenging” market, AGL remains positive and expects an underlying profit after tax for FY21 of between $500 million and $580 million.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/11/western-australia-continues-community-battery-rollout/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 11, 2021",Western Australia continues community battery rollout,"PowerBank 3, the largest trial in the scheme to date with up to 600 Western Australian households able to leverage battery storage technology, will commence next month and follows the installation of nine 116 kW batteries across the state late last year.
The PowerBank 3 trial follows the PowerBank 1 and 2 trials, which launched in Mandurah, and Ellenbrook in Perth’s northern suburbs, over the past three years.
The first of the trials, in the Mandurah suburb of Meadow Springs in 2018, delivered participants a collective saving of about $11,000 on their power bills, or an average of $228 per customer, over the first year of operation of the 105 kW/420 kWh battery. 
The 18-month PowerBank 3 trial is designed to enable participants to experience the benefits of a behind-the-meter battery for a fraction of the upfront cost. Households will be able to store up to 6 kWh or 8 kWh of excess solar energy produced by their rooftop solar PV systems for later use. Participants will pay a daily subscription fee of $1.20 per day or $1.40 per day, for 6 kWh or 8 kWh of storage respectively.
The trial will also allow participants to accrue excess energy over the course of their billing cycle, providing the opportunity to offset peak energy consumption.
Synergy chief executive officer Jason Waters said the trial would provide invaluable learnings about the role batteries could play in the future energy market.
“Renewable and distributed energy resources such as battery storage are major parts of Western Australia’s energy future, and we are committed to the continued exploration of these technologies,” he said.
“PowerBank 3 is an excellent way for us to continue to test the application of energy storage to help meet the needs of individual households, as well as those of the broader electricity network.
“Directly partnering with customers and industry peers, including Western Power, is key to delivering solutions that are cost-effective for our community and sustainable for ongoing network stability.”

Western Power CEO Ed Kalajzic said the latest PowerBank trial was one of a number of new technologies the network operator was using to better manage the growing abundance of renewables, meet customer energy needs, and improve the efficiency of WA’s valuable south-west grid infrastructure.
“From a grid perspective, community batteries enable us to work with the community to soak up excess solar power, store it and re-use it later when solar generation drops but power need increases. It becomes a tool that helps us smooth the flow of renewables on the grid,” he said.
“It also means we can safely integrate more solar-generated electricity on the grid, which is great news for homeowners and businesses.
“Community batteries are an excellent example of what we’re aiming to achieve for the benefit of the whole community and we now have the insights and data to expand on this further.”
Participants will move to a time-of-use pricing plan with any unused solar energy sold back to Synergy at the Renewable Energy Buyback Scheme rate and credited to their Synergy account.
Batteries have been installed in both metropolitan and regional areas of WA, including Kalgoorlie, Port Kennedy,  Canning Vale, Vasse and Ellenbrook.

Today, Macquarie has announced that GIGs Renewable Energy Fund 2 has raised over AUD$2.5 billion in investor commitments.
This is the second major GIG Renewable Energy Fund, the first was dedicated to an operational offshore wind fund and now manages investments in a 1.45 GW portfolio of six offshore wind farms around the United Kingdom (UK).
The fundraising strategy, spearheaded by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA) which already overseas investments of 12.3 GW of green generation globally, vastly exceeded its original fundraising target. The 25-year closed-end fund will invest in a diverse portfolio of solar and wind projects in Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand.
In a statement, Macquarie said that 32 different though largely Eurocentric investors contributed to the fund from pension funds, local government pension schemes, insurers and sovereign wealth funds. But added that commitments were also received from investors in Asia-Pacific and North America.
Leigh Harrison, Head of MIRA EMEA, said that the energy transition to renewables was the key driver for investors. “Our changing climate presents profound challenges to our environment, economy and way of life,” said Harrison, “It is vital we take action to accelerate the shift to clean energy, building on the opportunities presented by rapid technological change, falling technology costs and strong political and regulatory support.”

The acceleration of GIG in recent months is not a surprise to Ivan Varughese, Head of Asia-Pacific for GIG, who said last year that “Renewable energy infrastructure has proven to be a resilient investment, even in the face of Covid-19 because demand for electricity will still grow and the need to decarbonise remains an immediate one.”
The fund has already made to investments, a 10% stake in the 576 MW Gwynt y Môr Offshore Wind Farm in the UK, and a 50% stake in a 268 MW portfolio of residential rooftop solar projects in the U.S.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/11/unsw-researchers-to-develop-roadmap-for-using-excess-renewables-to-power-industry/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BLAKE MATICH,"FEBRUARY 11, 2021",UNSW researchers to develop roadmap for using excess renewables to power industry,"The University of New South Wales (UNSW) has established a team of researchers led by Scientia Professor Rose Amal from the School of Chemical Engineering to develop a roadmap exercise in the potential to use excess renewable energy to make fuel, chemicals and feedstocks for New South Wales (NSW) infrastructure. 
The NSW Power-to-X (P2X) Industry Feasibility Study, will look at opportunities in the NSW infrastructural makeup to use excess renewable energy from solar, wind, and other sources to decarbonise and grow local manufacturing. 
P2X technologies are technologies that can be utilised to store surplus renewable energy as chemical energy, such as using excess solar to produce a clean fuel like green hydrogen, ammonia, methane, etc. This is useful because such chemical energies are far easier to store than electricity. 
UNSW is right at the forefront of this research, only last month chemical engineers from UNSW and the University of Sydney made a significant technological breakthrough in the development of green ammonia. The researchers were able to produce green ammonia from air, water, and solar energy in a fashion that does not require high temperatures, high pressures, or enormous amounts of infrastructure.
Amal says the processes of producing such chemicals is energy-intensive, but that that is exactly why cheap renewable energy from solar is employed to keep costs down. “NSW has untapped renewable energy potential that presents excellent opportunities to build a P2X industry at scale, – to meet domestic and export demand for green energy” says Amal, “P2X offers opportunities for deep decarbonisation for hard-to-abate industries, regional development and investment attraction, as well as exporting renewable energy to overseas markets via hydrogen carriers.”

“Countries such as Germany, Japan and South Korea are already seeking partners and locations in Australia for renewable hydrogen production, to export to their respective countries,” continued Amal, “NSW has all the ingredients required for a future hydrogen economy and a rare opportunity to lead the P2X development. But we must act urgently and invest in the technology and start building capabilities now, to ensure we capture this enormous opportunity for our state and our country.” 
NSW Chief Scientist & Engineer Hugh Durrant-Whyte added that a P2X industry would greatly accelerate the hydrogen economy in the state and provide substantial economic and environmental benefits.
“There is an existing demand for hydrogen and a growing market for other P2X products overseas, in NSW and across Australia,” said Durrant-Whyte, who stressed that the transport, electricity and gas industries are already actively searching for P2X solutions as a way of effectively decarbonising their processes and products. 
“A local P2X industry could play a major role in NSW’s target of net zero emissions by 2050 and create hundreds of jobs,” said Durrant-Whyte, who seconded Amal’s call for immediate, targeted and coordinated investment in these technologies. 
Amal’s research team will include members from UNSW Sydney, University of Newcastle, University of Wollongong, University of Sydney and CSIRO.
