Green? Blue? Blended? Queensland’s GEAP project defies hydrogen categories,"The Gladstone Energy and Ammonia Project, known as GEAP bills itself as “Australia’s largest and most advanced clean hydrogen production project”, and today, its owner, Australian Future Energy (AFE), announced it has signed an MoU with Japanese general trading company Itochu Corporation to explore potential for Itochu to invest in GEAP, to market GEAP product, and also to integrate renewable energy into GEAP’s production.
The MOU brings GEAP a significant step closer to producing the equivalent of 91,000 tonnes of hydrogen, in the form of 230,000 tonnes of ammonia and 14 petajoules of synthetic natural gas per annum, from a coal-gasification process that captures CO2 for use in the food industry.
The $1 billion undertaking has been designated a Coordinated Project by the Queensland Government, meaning the state’s Coordinator General is overseeing its Environmental Impact Assessment.
This status is typically accorded to large, complex infrastructure projects that “have economic significance but also the potential for significant environmental impacts”, the independent Environmental Defenders Office explains on its website.
GEAP will initially offer “blue hydrogen” at a cost of US$1.50 per kilo (or AU$2 at today’s exchange rate) and its other outputs for local consumption. 
It expects to employ around 1,000 workers during its construction phase, and 200 in ongoing operations.
AFE CEO, Kerry Parker says its emissions will amount to 25,000 tonnes per annum, or the equivalent greenhouse gas output of almost 3,600 average Australian households.
The GEAP plant, using US company Synthesis Energy Systems’ (SES) technology, will operate from a 129-hectare site just outside Gladstone where it will be integrated with adjacent gas, fertiliser, explosives, power and water infrastructure.
It’s also positioned within the designated Queensland Government preferred industrial site to facilitate third-party green hydrogen production, R&D and demonstration projects.
Parker told pv magazine Australia today that GEAP, “can play a significant role as a real enabler for a number of small green hydrogen projects in the Gladstone region”, which he says are looking to produce between 500 and 5,000 tonnes per annum.
He explained, “as part of our plant design, we’ve got capacity to be able to take production from those smaller projects into our ammonia works, providing them with a natural offtaker.”
He says future expansion of the GEAP could continue to be integrated with the scaling up of green hydrogen projects in the region.
GEAP’s proven commercialised technology (SES has at least five plants successfully operational in Asia) working at scale, access to infrastructure, and now budding access to overseas markets via Itochu expertise, “can provide great assistance and great value to the green hydrogen projects around Gladstone”, says Parker.
The CEO has a wealth of experience as Chief Financial Officer for companies mining metals in Australia and Africa, and with gas companies such as Santos and Arrow Energy; and has for the past four years been working to get GEAP up and running as a flagship project for AFE.
The company has two other infrastructure-connected projects at much less advanced stages of development: the Surat Basin Hydrogen Hub, and a third blue-hydrogen plant 230 kilometres south west of Townsville. 
Parker expects GEAP to have negotiated its Environmental Impact Statement, and reach final investment decision by late 2022; building of the plant will take around two years, which would have it operational at the end of 2024.
There are clearly pluses for Gladstone’s green hydrogen producers in partnering with this first AFE project, having access to its expertise, and plugging into its infrastructure; and clearly minuses in terms of emissions — not only from the plant operations, but from the burning of the generated syngas.
AFE has no plans to transition its plant, which has an expected lifetime of 30-plus years, to green hydrogen production but, Parker says, “we see future expansions at the plant coming through bolt-on green hydrogen modules, once that technology becomes more mature and gets to a cost of production that industry and consumers can sustain.”
A federal government with clear emissions goals might be more capable of truly integrating Australian expertise, resources and capability towards positive outcomes for both the nascent green hydrogen industry, the Australian economy, and its emissions balance sheet.

Federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley rejected the latest plans proposed for AREH — which shifted required infrastructure to suit production and export of green hydrogen and ammonia, rather than the original plan which mooted export of most of the project’s prodigious electricity output via underwater cable to Asia — on the grounds that they would pose a risk to threatened bird species that inhabit the wetlands.
The minister found that “the marine component of the infrastructure corridor would disrupt tidal movement and processes, and this would seriously impact the habitats and life-cycle of the native species dependent on the wetland,” a ministerial spokesperson said.

AREH consortium members include Intercontinental Energy (one of the world’s biggest green hydrogen developers); renewable energy developer CWP Global; Vestas wind-turbine system manufacturers; the Nyangumarta traditional owners; and the Australian National University’s Energy Change Institute.
In response to last week’s rejection, the group issued a statement saying, “we will take concerns on board as we continue to work on the detailed design and engineering aspects of the project.”
In October 2020 AREH was deemed to dovetail with the federal government’s Technology Investment Road map, which highlights hydrogen (renewable or fossil-fuel derived) development as an investment priority.
The government’s decision comes at a time when its coalition is under pressure from leadership ructions in the National Party, which coalesced late last week into virulent rejection of a pending federal government commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050. 
This morning those ructions turned into a spill that reinstates anti-net zero emissions populist, Barnaby Joyce as head of the Nationals, and as Deputy Prime Minister.
Sussan Ley’s decision predates today’s demonstration of Nationals’ discontent, but seems to have caught other supporters of the AREH project unaware.
Allanah MacTiernan, the Western Australian Minister for Regional Development and the Hydrogen Industry, said “we’re very surprised at how quickly the decision was met, and it appears that there wasn’t a lot of discussion with the proponent.”
She also suggested that coal-based hydrogen projects, which often have significant environmental impacts related to emissions, have easily negotiated federal government approval.

Development of the AREH proposal began in 2014, and Lead Agency Status was granted by the WA government in 2018, followed by the Federal Major Project Status conferral last year.
“Major Status” assumes fast-tracking — though not sidelining of environmental and other responsibilities — of the project in anticipation of the benefits it will bring to a region, or to the country as a whole.
A land parcel of 6,500 square kilometres has been secured for the combined wind and solar generation of the AREH through the WA Department of Lands, and the project was identified as a major diversifier of the Pilbara economy, generating some 20,000 jobs during its 10 years of staged construction, and thousands of permanent jobs as operations come on line from 2027.
Some 3 GW of output from the vast project are earmarked for large energy users in the Pilbara region which may include new or expanded mines and downstream processing of minerals, enabling a value-added component to Australia’s export of resources. 
The Western Australian Government approved the first, 15 GW stage of the AREH, in 2018, based on the recommendation of the state’s Environmental Protection Authority.
Back in 2017, the Australian Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment had also conditionally approved AREH’s then proposal.
The conditions related to several impacts, on terrestrial, marine and wetland habitat, but with regard to wetlands in particular, they included: “To avoid and mitigate the impacts of infrastructure on threatened shorebirds and migratory birds the approval holder must: space wind turbines such that individual turbines in each row are separated by at least 800m and each row is separated at least four kilometres from the next row” and that the proponent should “not undertake construction or cable installation activities within the Eighty Mile Beach Ramsar Site boundary during peak migration periods for threatened shorebirds and migratory birds (1 October through to 31 March in any year)”.
AREH plans, more recently amended towards large-scale export of green ammonia, are understood to include development of pipelines to transport ammonia and the construction of a new town between Broome and Port Hedland to house workers.
With limited detail available, it is hard to fully understand how the project now warrants a decision that declares it “unacceptable” and therefore unapproved.
The Clean Energy Council (CEC) released a statement this morning saying it understands, “that the Federal Minister for the Environment has rejected the expanded proposal for this project prior to the completion of detailed environmental studies”.
The renewable energy industry body is now “seeking urgent clarification” and for Sussan Ley to “address the perception that this decision is inconsistent with well-established processes or with the treatment of non-renewable projects”.
In a report by ABC News this morning, MacTiernan said “we need to be very clear about where the government stands with hydrogen.”
She, too, alluded to the approvals of “quite controversial coal projects” in the push to develop hydrogen of any hue.
She added, “everyone, theoretically, has signed on to the notion that we will be ultimately replacing our natural gas exports with hydrogen exports. We’re going to need to work cooperatively to find a way in which this can be done.”
Asked by the ABC to comment on the rejection of AREH’s proposal this morning Professor Andrew Blakers from the ANU’s Institute for Climate, Energy and Disaster Solutions emphasised the importance of locating and building renewable energy projects to high environmental standards, but added, that he would like to see “all mine sites in the future” run “primarily from solar and/or wind”.
In the light of AREH’s potential to enable such ambitions for Australian minerals extraction, he hoped the project would be able to work around the issues raised by the federal government approval process.
He said “firm adherence to guidelines means most of the potential environmental downsides will already have been thought out and ameliorated.”
In its statement, the CEC says it expects the Commonwealth to work in partnership with the AREH consortium, and “provide the necessary guidance to appropriately assess and address any environmental impact” of the project under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.
It describes the AREH as “a transformative economic opportunity for Australia, making a significant contribution to local and global decarbonisation efforts.”
Has decarbonisation been taken off the National agenda as the government heads towards an election with the emissions-breathing Nationals in tow?

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/21/liberal-sprinkling-of-490-million-sees-nsw-effectively-rally-drivers-to-buy-evs-and-reduce-emissions/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"JUNE 21, 2021",Liberal sprinkling of $490 million sees NSW effectively rally drivers to buy EVs and reduce emissions,"New South Wales Energy and Environment Minister, Matt Kean has introduced a $490 million plan to “charge up the nation and make NSW the Norway of Australia when it comes to EVs”,  he tweeted Sunday morning.
In Norway, 75% of new car purchases are now made up of electric vehicles (EVs), whereas just 0.75% of cars bought in Australia are currently electric, and the global average is around 4%.
The New South Wales Government policy to rapidly increase the EVs on our roads, focuses on waiving stamp duty on the purchase of EVs and hydrogen fuel-cell-powered vehicles from 1 September; and offering a $3,000 rebate to the first 25,000 private purchasers of electric vehicles priced under $68,750.
CEO of the Electric Vehicle Council in Australia, Behyad Jafari, responded on Twitter to the announcement, calling it “the best policy in Australia and measuring up to global standards”.
⚡️We’re putting NSW in pole position for the EV Revolution ⚡️🚗
Today, I joined @Dom_Perrottet and @AndrewConstance to launch our nation-leading Electric Vehicle Strategy, with almost half a billion dollar investment in tax cuts and incentives to drive an electric revolution. pic.twitter.com/gH1qnru41L
— Matt Kean MP (@Matt_KeanMP) June 20, 2021

Stamp duty on vehicles bought in NSW is calculated at $3 per $100 of the vehicle’s value up to a purchase price of $45,000; cars valued above that amount incur stamp duty of $1,350, plus $5 per $100, for any amount greater than $45,000 — which is more typically the price range of EVs sold in Australia.
In addition, the Berejiklian Government says it will delay charging zero-and low-emissions vehicles a road-user tax (designed to replace the revenue lost in excise from petrol sales), until new EVs make up 30% of new car sales, or until 2027 — whichever comes first.
Jafari said on Twitter, “This is how grown ups do reform,” and “The State has taken a sensible, consultative view to road user charges.” 
That’s in contrast to the Victorian EV road-user tax that will come into force on 1 July this year, which the Electric Vehicle Council slammed as “ludicrous”. 
In May, however, Victoria also introduced a $3,000 rebate on the purchase of EVs valued at less than $69,000, set a target of 50% of new car sales being zero or low emissions by 2030, and promised to help fund more charging infrastructure.
Yesterday, the NSW Government pledged $171 million in funding for extra charging opportunities in the state, directing $131 towards ultra-fast vehicle chargers, $20 million in grants for “destination” chargers in regional areas and a further $20 million for charging infrastructure at public transport hubs.
It placed an additional overlay on the NSW charging map, saying it will strive to ensure that households with limited off-street parking are no more than 5 kilometres from a charger; and that major highways will have chargers installed at 100 km intervals, while main roads in Sydney are to be punctuated every five kilometres by charging opportunities.
“Our aim is to increase EV sales to more than 50% of new cars sold in NSW by 2030,” said Kean, “and for EVs to be the vast majority of new cars sold in the state by 2035”.
The strategy is ultimately designed to contribute to the state’s ambitions to get to net zero emissions by 2050.
Kean explained the Liberal NSW government has calculated that, “with new cars staying on the road 15 years on average, the vast majority of new cars sold in NSW need to be EVs by 2035,” in order to achieve the 2050 target.
Preferential treatment of EV drivers in NSW will also be extended in the form of access to transit lanes otherwise reserved for cars with two occupants (T2 lanes) or three occupants (T3 lanes) at peak traffic times.
The government forecasts that introducing its suite of incentives will bring new EV  car sales to 52% by 2030-31.
Those future EV drivers received an extra boost of range confidence when start-up venture Bell Resources, which is chaired by NSW ex-Liberal leader Kerry Chikarovski, last week announced its acquisition of 63 car-wash businesses in Victoria, the ACT, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia, and its intention to add EV fast charging to the sites.
Bell Resources intends kitting out the car washes with ultra-fast direct-current (DC) charging infrastructure provided by Swiss/Swedish company ABB, substantially powered by new rooftop solar-plus-battery installations of initially 100 kW generation and 200 kWh storage capacity, but with the potential to expand the solar over leased neighbourhood rooftops and grow the battery storage in increments of 100kWh.
Chief Executive of Bell Resources, Mark Avery, last week told the Australian Financial Review that car washes are more suited than petrol stations as sites for EV chargers, because they don’t have to deal with the 12-metres-from-the-petrol-bowser safeguards that apply to petrol stations, don’t have the site-contamination issues of petrol-station infrastructure, yet are built for high-volume vehicle movement. He added that in most states they’re also not required to obtain EV development approval.

Combined car-wash revenues and the energy cost benefits of stored rooftop solar generation, says Avery, will allow the disruptor to sell its charge at around 10 cents a kilowatt.
This could leave Tesla charging stations eating dust, given their typical pricing of around 52 cents a kilowatt. 
Of course there are several other charge brands currently expanding or setting up in Australia — including the largest, Chargefox, with around 500 public chargers; the NRMA with almost 40 chargers; and up and comer Evie Networks, which is rolling out around 80 ultra-fast chargers across 42 locations in Australia.
Like petrol stations, Bell Hub-branded charge stations will offer dynamic charge pricing, which represents the best price available at any time from a combination of solar, battery and grid energy, with renewables providing the bulk of dispatched electricity.
Although drivers won’t be able to wash and charge their vehicles simultaneously (!), Bell Hubs’ ABB 350 kW DC fast chargers claim to add some 30 km of range to an EV every minute that they’re plugged in — so topping up won’t take long.
Avery says the company plans to expand its network to 300 charging stations over the coming few years.
It also has ambitions to build solar farms in Australia and the United States, in close proximity to its EV charging sites, “to improve control over energy costs and improve margins”; and to develop innovative and efficient approaches to EV lithium ion-battery development and manufacture, its website says.
Australians may not be skiing cross country any time soon, but the wheels seem to be turning on the country’s EV ecosystem, and it’s looking more likely that within a couple of years you’ll be driving like a Norwegian.

Chinese solar panel makers JinkoSolar, Longi and JA Solar have released a white paper intended to show what they believe are the advantages for developers of large scale PV projects of using photovoltaic modules manufactured with M10, 182mm wafers.
“The 182mm-wafer-size module is the most cost–effective solution based on the in–depth analysis of various boundary conditions of the whole industrial value chain,” the document reads. “Without efficiency improvement, further increase on module power with larger size modules will not achieve lower system cost.”
The three manufacturers emphasised the increasing reliability risks associated with larger and more powerful products and reiterated the well-known saying “bigger is not always better,” heard in recent months from all those companies that decided not to bet on 210mm wafers, and modules with a power output exceeding 600 W. JA Solar, however, launched an 800 W product in August.
According to the analysis by the three companies, which considered factors such as manufacturing, transportation, installation, power generation performance and system matching, the ideal module weight for easy deployment is 3.3kg and the maximum weight should not exceed 35kg. Furthermore, glass thickness for bifacial products should not be over 2mm. “On the premise of [a] two [times] 2mm, double-glass, structure and reasonable control of the frame cost, the size of the module should be within a limit, otherwise its ability to resist static and dynamic load will be weakened seriously,” the experts from the three companies stated, adding that glass burst and micro–cracks become more frequent if these size and width parameters are exceeded.
In terms of yield and efficiency, 182mm wafers do not differ substantially from 166mm products, however, they can provide a significant balance-of-system (BoS) cost reduction, due to their increased size and current. These lower costs are achieved thanks to three main factors: A larger racking design which reduces support and pile foundation costs per watt; a reduced length of the cables connecting PV strings and combiner boxes, or string inverters; and a lower labor cost associated with the limited increase in the product’s size. “The 182mm-wafer-size module is compatible with the design of two rows of vertical (2P) and four rows of horizontal (4L) racks, and can adapt to different terrain conditions by adjusting the number of strings on a single rack,” the paper notes.
The manufacturers compared the BoS costs of 182mm-wafer-size modules and 210mm products installed on the 4L rack, and found that the former have a slight advantage in racking, foundation, and land costs. “Excessive working current of a module will lead to a significant increase of the heat losses on the metal contact surface of the cell, the ribbon and the bus bar, which will increase the working temperature of the module to a certain extent,” the experts stated.

Astronauts Shane Kimbrough of NASA and Thomas Pesquet of the European Space Agency (ESA) have completed their spacewalk upgrade of the international space station, installing the new iROSA roll-out solar arrays.  
The duration of the spacewalk was scheduled to last six and a half hours, and ended up totalling seven hours fifteen minutes, with the astronauts utilising their battery-powered suits to traverse the exterior of the station. 
It cost about $100 million to install the six arrays, which were produced by US manufacturer and space infrastructure technology company Redwire Space, Inc. The arrays have a capacity of 120 kW and will increase the station’s power generation by 20-30%.  
The previous arrays had been designed for a 15-year service life, but had been continually operating since December 2000. Although they were functioning well, the older arrays were showing signs of degradation.
Before the new array can begin supplying power, the spacewalkers will need to install electrical cables and drive the final two bolts, thus allowing the panels to unfurl into the deployed position. This will take place on June 20th, and can be viewed live on NASA’s website. 
This is the third spacewalk Kimbrough and Pesquet have conducted in tandem, following two 2017 expeditions in which the astronauts replaced the orbiting laboratory’s nickel-hydrogen batteries with new lithium-ion batteries.
