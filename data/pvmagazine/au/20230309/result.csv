The Renewable Projects Quarterly Report for Q4 2022 shows developers made the highest quarterly investment since Q3 2018. Six renewable energy generation and storage projects reached financial close, representing 1,923 MW of new installed generation capacity and 800 MWh of energy storage. In terms of installed capacity, this was 1,523 MW more than Q3 2022 and 1,824 MW more than the same period 12 months ago. For storage, this was 516 MWh more than Q3, however 647 MWh less than 12 months ago.
The year-end figures lifted investment commitments to $6.2 billion for 2022, a 17% increase on the previous year but CEC Chief Executive Officer Kane Thornton said the level of investment may still not be enough to achieve the federal government’s ambition to increase the share of renewable energy in the National Electricity Market (NEM) to 82% by 2030.
“While the uptick is encouraging, one quarter doesn’t mean a trend. Australia is deploying new large-scale generation – wind and solar farms – more slowly than needed to reach the 82% target for renewable energy on the NEM,” he said.
“The fact remains that the rolling quarterly average investment over 12 months has not risen above $2 billion since the second quarter of 2019.”

Thornton said the increase in investment was a response to the “more positive political and policy environment” and greater coordination by governments but urged those same governments to review their policies to ensure ongoing increased investment.
“The current policy settings are only going to get us so far, and it’s clear that with significant shifts in capital overseas through the United States Inflation Reduction Act and other responses from the likes of the European Union and the Gulf States, Australia needs to do more,” he said.
The release of the report comes a fortnight after the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) warned of potential “reliability gaps” in the grid if renewable projects are not accelerated as coal and gas generators continue to exit the system.
In its updated Electricity Statement of Opportunities, AEMO noted that all mainland states in the NEM are forecast to breach the reliability standard from 2027 onwards without “urgent” action to encourage more clean energy capacity and storage.
“Urgent and ongoing investment in renewable energy, long-duration storage and transmission is needed to reliably meet demand from Australian homes and businesses,” AEMO Chief Executive Officer Daniel Westerman said.
The CEC quarterly report shows that in 2022, 26 projects across Australia reached financial commitment. This was seven projects fewer than 2021 and the lowest annual tally of new projects reaching this stage since the council began recording data in 2017.
A total of 26 generation and storage projects began construction in 2022, while only 18 were commissioned. In 2021, these totals reached 32 and 46 respectively.
New South Wales contributed the most financially committed projects in 2022, with its five generation projects accounting for 1,559 MW and an additional six projects contributing 5700 MWh worth of storage. Victoria and Queensland each contributed five projects for 2022, followed by South Australia with three.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/09/cleanco-to-transform-old-coal-fired-power-precinct-into-green-energy-hub/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 9, 2023",CleanCo to transform old coal-fired power precinct into green energy hub,"A former coal power station site near the city of Ipswich in Queensland’s southeast will be transformed into a clean energy hub featuring a 250 MW/500 MWh big battery, an onsite solar farm and green hydrogen production facilities.
State-owned renewable power generator CleanCo said the proposed Swanbank Clean Energy Hub would be developed on a 336-hectare site on the outskirts of Ipswich west of Brisbane.
CleanCo said the site has an overall transmission network capacity of approximately 1.2 GW, providing significant potential for new energy opportunities that support the state’s renewable energy ambitions.
The site originally hosted two coal-fired power stations with the last of those units decommissioned in 2012. The site is now home to the 385 MW gas-fired Swanbank E power station which is to be integrated into the new renewable energy hub.
CleanCo Chief Executive Officer Tom Metcalfe said the publicly owned company is undertaking a master planning process to guide the development of low-emission energy generation and storage opportunities and identify “how the site may best serve the energy network and the local community into the future.”
“We are progressing a 250 MW battery project and are seeking expressions of interest for alternative energy options including potential hydrogen production and hydrogen use, while also exploring alternative energy storage options,” he said.

Metcalfe said CleanCo will open expressions of interest for businesses to pitch what energy is produced at the site in the coming months.
“We’ll be seeking proposals from industry to develop hydrogen production and use here at the site and also to look at alternative energy storage options,” he said.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the Swanbank Clean Energy Hub is part of the government’s $62 billion Energy and Jobs Plan, which aims to supply 70% of the state’s energy demands from renewables by 2032, and 80% by 2035.
“What we’re doing is progressing a master-planned approach to a precinct where we’ll bring together wind energy, solar, and the production of hydrogen,” he said.
“The clean energy hub at Swanbank has the potential to generate up to 1.2 GW of power. And to put that into context, that’s over 10% of what Queensland uses each and every day at its peak.”
“The Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan is all about a future of cheaper, cleaner and secure energy for Queenslanders, with 70% of it renewable by 2032.”

The announcement comes a day after state-owned generator CS Energy revealed the company’s coal-fired Callide power station near Biloela in central Queensland won’t be fully operational until January next year.
The 1,540 MW Callide power station, which meets about 30% of the state’s electricity demand, has not operated at capacity since May 2021. That was when the plant’s C4 generation unit was destroyed in an explosion, while the C3 unit was taken offline after structure failure caused a collapse of its cooling tower in September.
The C3 unit was due to return to full capacity by September 30, while the C4 unit was due to be fully operational by October 31.
However, CS Energy said it would delay the return of both units to full capacity so it can rebuild the cooling towers of both units.
The return of C3 had been postponed by six months to 31 December 2023, while C4 has been delayed another eight months.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/09/solar-power-can-cut-living-costs-but-its-not-an-option-for-many-people-they-need-better-support/,"FINANCE,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",,"MARCH 9, 2023","Solar power can cut living costs, but it’s not an option for many people – they need better support","From the Conversation
Many are unable to install energy-saving options such as solar panels or insulation because of the upfront costs or because they are renters who cannot make changes to the dwelling. Among those who are financially stressed, earn less than A$50,000 or are between the ages of 18 and 34, a large majority do not intend to install energy-saving options, largely because they cannot afford them.
Renewable energy is not just critical for saving on energy bills, but also for mitigating climate change and fostering sustainable development. However, the reality is access to solar power is not equitable for all Australians. Our new research shows without better government support, many people will miss out on its benefits.
Our research focuses on how to make access to rooftop solar more equitable.
It is important to distinguish between equity and equality. Equality means every household will be given the same resources or opportunities. For example, every household would receive the same subsidy to install solar panels.
Equity refers to fairness. The idea of equity recognises not all households start from the same place. Instead, adjustments to imbalances might be required.
In the context of solar adoption, equity would mean every Australian can benefit from solar power. Any subsidies or other support would be adjusted based on individual circumstances.
To better understand how it affects the adoption of solar panels, we looked at several aspects of inequity. These include financial situation, renting status, gender, education and ethnicity.
For our study, we collected 167 studies worldwide on household solar panel adoption to determine what we know about how it’s affected by these aspects of inequity.
Renewable energy for renters is on the way and the answer may lie in the growing trend of community solar gardens. Solar gardens are a collection of panels located together and connected to the grid. Households unable to have solar panels can buy into these gardens
— Gecko Gold Coast (@GeckoGoldCoast) January 28, 2022

Our findings show there is very limited in-depth data and research on this issue in Australia. Australian studies on residential solar uptake account for 20 (12%) of the 167 studies.
Research in Australia tends to focus on equity related to income. Of the 20 Australian studies, six find a positive link between income and solar panel adoption, four find a negative link, five show inconclusive results and five omit income altogether.
These mixed results can be explained, in part, by the fact that a range of factors impact whether a household can afford solar power. For example, a somewhat higher household income does not automatically mean that a household has less bill stress and enough accumulated wealth to afford the upfront cost of installing solar power.
Few studies offer a deeper analysis of variables such as education or ethnicity. For Australia, only five studies looked at education and only one at ethnicity. There is a lack of data on solar uptake among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.
This limited research does not allow for definite conclusions about how these variables impact rooftop solar uptake.
Energy-saving installations in investment properties have also received limited attention. Many Australian renters report their dwellings have extremely poor insulation. This leads to hot indoor temperatures in summer and cold conditions in winter.
Renters typically have limited ways to fix these problems. The only available options for many renters are air conditioning and portable heaters powered by traditional energy sources, which increases electricity bills.

Policies that could improve equity in rooftop solar access include:
Some programs are in place to help home owners on low incomes to install solar systems. For example, New South Wales has a “Solar for low-income households” program. Eligible individuals can get a free 3-kilowatt solar system in return for giving up the Low-Income Household Rebate for ten years. South Australia had a “Switch for Solar” trial, for which applications closed on August 31 2022.
However, to access these schemes Australians must first overcome one difficult hurdle: home ownership.
In addition, a focus on income alone can be problematic. Directing subsidies to low-income households alone misses households with low wealth that are above an income threshold.
The Australian government has promised new policy approaches. Its Powering Australia Plan pledged $102.2 million for community solar banks. These are community-owned projects to improve access for those currently locked out of solar power. Households can lease or buy a plot in these solar banks, instead of using their own rooftops.
The success of such projects will depend on whether they are accessible to and affordable for everyone.
More data collection is needed to identify priorities for policy action on energy equity. This can include a new Household Energy Consumption Survey (the Australian Bureau of Statistics conducted such a survey until a decade ago), broader analysis by researchers to consider equity dimensions, and collaboration between researchers and policymakers to trial new policies.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/09/vecco-plans-australian-first-vanadium-electrolyte-manufacturing-facility/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 9, 2023",Vecco plans ‘Australian first’ vanadium electrolyte manufacturing facility,"Brisbane-based Vecco Group will build what is being described as Australia’s first commercial-scale vanadium flow battery electrolyte manufacturing facility with the Townsville plant initially capable of producing enough electrolytes to support 175 MWh of energy storage capacity annually before scaling up to 350 MWh.
Vecco said the Townsville vanadium battery manufacturing facility will produce the electrolyte used in vanadium flow batteries, a proven option for large-scale energy storage, opening up downstream manufacturing opportunities and creating a new link in the supply chain. It will also support the development of Vecco’s Debella critical minerals mine near Julia Creek, about 650 kilometres west of Townsville.
The manufacturing facility is expected to commence production later this year. When operational, the company said it will produce nine megalitres of electrolyte annually, equating to an energy storage capacity of 175 MWh annually with plans to expand to 350 MWh.
Vecco plans to produce vanadium and high purity alumina (HPA) at its Debella project which will be integrated with the new manufacturing facility. The Debella project is expected to begin production in 2024 and is forecast to produce 5,500 tonnes of vanadium pentoxide per year and 2,000 tonnes of HPA annually over a mine life of more than 50 years.
Until the Debella project comes online, Vecco said it will use imported vanadium to produce high-grade vanadium electrolyte in Townsville.
Vecco Group Managing Director Thomas Northcott said the manufacturing facility will be a key enabler for vanadium flow batteries in the Queensland grid, with the technology providing a proven grid-scale energy storage solution with advantages including a long lifespan, lengthy storage capability and are non-flammable.
“We’ll be able to integrate mining and manufacturing and apply our expertise in critical minerals into the downstream supply chain to assist Queensland to achieve its renewable energy target,” he said.
“Australia’s demand for medium and deep duration storage by 2050 has been estimated at over 180 GWh by the market operator, vanadium flow batteries made right here in Townsville from Queensland’s minerals can help meet this need while creating good jobs in regional areas.”

The Townsville manufacturing facility has been backed by the Queensland government through its Industry Partnership Program, and the project is part of the state’s $62 billion Energy and Jobs Plan, which includes creating a North Queensland battery industry supply chain.
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the Townsville facility will be Australia’s first commercial-scale vanadium flow battery electrolyte manufacturing facility.
“This is history making,” he said. “Townsville will be the first place in the country to manufacture large-scale vanadium batteries. The batteries will be Queensland made and they will form part of a new vanadium supply chain, providing enormous possibilities for North Queensland.”
Miles said vanadium flow batteries will provide the grid-scale storage needed so renewable energy sources, like wind and solar, can reliably power Queensland homes, businesses and industries. The Queensland government is aiming to supply 70% of the state’s energy demands from renewables by 2032, and 80% by 2035.
“The ability to store and discharge energy on an industrial scale is one of the final pieces in the puzzle for decarbonising the electricity network,” Miles said.
The launch of the Vecco project comes just days after the Queensland government announced it will commit $5 billion to take control of and build the CopperString electricity transmission project that will expand the National Electricity Market (NEM) from Townsville to Mount Isa.
The 1,100-kilometre project will link Mount Isa, Cloncurry and the North West Minerals Province to the national grid, unlocking an estimated 6 GW of renewable energy in north Queensland.

Following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), an energised solar industry is aiming high and envisioning a future where the U.S. has a robust domestic energy supply chain. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) released a roadmap to achieve this goal, with a target of 50 GW of annual solar manufacturing capacity by 2030.
The U.S. has been plagued by numerous pressures threatening the supply of solar modules imported from overseas. With decarbonisation and climate goals under threat due to this shortage, the U.S. is now turning to boosting domestic manufacturing to power the energy transition.
The Department of Energy (DOE) said, “Greatly expanding U.S. PV manufacturing could mitigate global supply chain challenges and lead to tremendous benefits for the climate as well as for U.S. workers, employers and the economy.”
The DOE concluded in a study that U.S. production could reach 10 GW in two years, 15 GW in three years and 25 GW in five years on its path to 50 GW annual production.
SEIA said domestic manufacturers should focus on building downstream production first, backfilling components with imports while upstream domestic production is built out. While scaling domestic module capacity will take 2-3 years, it will be 3-5 years before there is significant domestic manufacturing capacity for ingots, wafers and cells.
The DOE tracks the capacity of domestic manufacturing nationwide. Where does the U.S. stack up in relation to its goals? The figures below represent active capacity, which is set to expand dramatically following numerous investment announcements following the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
The traditional solar module supply chain begins with silicon or polysilicon sourcing. DOE tracks eight polysilicon or silicon metal facilities active in the U.S. with a combined capacity of producing 244.4 kilotons of refined material each year. The largest silicon metal facility is a 73 kiloton fabrication in run by WVA Manufacturing in West Virginia. The largest active polysilicon site is the 32 kiloton-per-year Hemlock Semiconductor, operated by Siemens AG.
Next along the value chain comes refined polysilicon ingots. The DOE tracks no active polysilicon ingot manufacturing capacity in the U.S. thus far.
After ingots are formed, they are further refined into polysilicon wafers. DOE reports only one wafer facility inside the U.S., a 20 MW per year facility run by CubicPV in Massachusetts.
Wafers are then converted to cells. DOE does not report any cell manufacturing capacity in the U.S. This is set to change as Hanwha Qcells announced a USD 2.5 billion ($3.8 billion) investment in a vertical module value chain. The company plans to manufacture 3.3 GW of solar ingots, wafers, cells, and finished modules in Cartersville and Dalton, Georgia, creating 2,500 clean energy jobs.
(Read: “Next-generation factories promise a brighter future for solar manufacturing“)
Cells are then integrated as solar modules, often known by the public as solar panels. The two main types of solar modules manufactured in the U.S. are polysilicon and cadmium telluride (CdTe).
In total, DOE reports 16 polysilicon module manufacturers with a combined total of 5.6 GW of manufacturing capacity. The largest operational facility is the 1.7 GW Qcells module manufacturing site in Georgia.
Many manufacturers have announced investment into module manufacturing, including, but not limited to a USD 2.5 billion ($3.8 billion) 3.3 GW vertical value chain committed by Qcells; a 3 GW facility by Enel North America and 3Sun USA; a 1 GW expansion by Mission Solar; and a 1.2 GW planned facility by Philadelphia Solar.
CdTe capacity combines across two manufacturers, First Solar and Toledo Solar, for a total of 2.9 GW per year. First Solar has announced plans to expand its manufacturing capacity to over 10 GW by 2025, investing USD 1.2 billion ($1.8 billion) to achieve this growth.
Next time, pv magazine will track the manufacturing capacities of essential components like racking, trackers, inverters, and energy storage systems.
