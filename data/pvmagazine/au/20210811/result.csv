Tomago Aluminium’s chief executive, Matt Howell, told the Australian Financial Review he envisages the smelter, located near Newcastle in the state’s north, will be run mostly on renewable energy by 2030.
“Our goal would be, by 2029, that the largest load in Australia is, for all intents and purposes, 100% renewable,” he said.
This would be a remarkable shift as the smelter, Australia’s largest, consumers more than 10% of the state’s electricity. It is presumably one of AGL’s biggest single contacts – clearly signalling that businesses are no longer willing to be associated with a company branded as Australia’s biggest emitter.
Tomago Aluminium is reportedly in discussions with suppliers for solar, wind and hydro power, but will require a reliable backup generator to ensure uninterrupted supply. Noting the fire at Neoen’s big battery in Geelong last month, the company’s CEO voiced concerns about both commercial viability and technical risks of battery storage, about which he remains skeptical.

Instead of opting for that path, Tomago Aluminium may contract with Snowy Hydro’s proposed Kurri Kurri gas power plant, saying the current cost of around $70/MWh for firmed renewable electricity would put the smelter out of business.
The Tomago Aluminium boss did, however, note the rapid pace of change around renewables, adding that by the time the company’s AGL contract expires in 2028, there may be more enticing clean options available.
One of the first renewable energy zones being developed in NSW is in the smelter’s Hunter region, which is traditionally a coal exporting area. The development of a number of renewable projects concentrated in this area will likely make Tomago Aluminium’s transition to renewable energy both easier and cheaper.
AGL, Australia’s largest electricity generator, has been at the butt of sustained criticism for its coal use. Successfully branded with the unenviable title of Australia’s biggest emitter, the company has recently sought to shift course and split in two.
AGL is also undertaking a massive push towards developing utility scale storage, committing to build 850 MW of battery-based assets by 2024. It remains to be seen whether the company will be able to change its course before markets for coal-generated electricity dry up entirely.

AGL Energy’s CEO, Markus Brokhof, said the company hopes to continue working with Tomago through decarbonisation. “We are committed to the Hunter region and continue to progress our plans to transform our thermal generation sites into low-carbon integrated industrial energy hubs that will support the decarbonisation of Australian industry… This includes progress on a grid-scale battery, wind, solar and thermal storage system and a waste to energy facility, while also exploring the feasibility of pumped hydro at Bell’s Mountain,” he said.

Last week, the Greens put up a disallowance motion in the Senate but were defeated after One Nation sided with the Coalition. It is possible to attempt another disallowance motion, and it is believed the Labor party will do so sometime before October 18, thought to be the deadline for such moves.
In June, the Senate blocked the Morrison government’s first attempt to shift the mandate of ARENA to include technologies like carbon capture and storage (CCS) and hydrogen generated by fossil-fuels. 
This is significant.

Undeterred, federal energy minister Angus Taylor last week pushed ahead with a renewed attempt. The move has been widely criticised, including by former ARENA chair, Greg Bourne.
Following the news of the Senate defeat last week, chief executive at the Smart Energy Council, John Grimes, said the council may sue the Morrison government should it continue with the changes.
If the Labor party were able to pass a disallowance motion, it would be a considerably easier route to vetoing Taylor’s move. Until then, the saga continues.

Construction on the Leeton and Fivebough farms began back in October 2020, and with a combined capacity of 14.6 MWp the plants’ commissioning is auspicious of the great renewable energy potential in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. 
Located in the New South Wales (NSW) town of Leeton, home of the mighty Leeton Phantoms, the two solar facilities utilise bi-facial modules on single-axis trackers with a grid connection owned and operated by Essential Energy. Together they have an estimated generation capacity of 27.8 GWh of solar energy for the National Electricity Market (NEM) and for Large Generation Certificates (LGCs), meaning no power purchase agreements (PPAs) are yet in place but due to the rising popularity of PPAs, the possibility remains open as a future revenue source. 
“Today marks another milestone for Photon Energy,” said Michael Gartner, CTO of Photon Energy Group, “with the commissioning of the first utility-scale plants in Australia to be added to our portfolio, which will help the Group in reducing the seasonality of electricity-generation revenues globally.” 

“Our merchant approach in Australia paves the way for grid-competitive assets to be developed and added to our European markets and elsewhere in the world,” continued Gartner. “In these challenging times, we are proud that our Australian team has made another major achievement, representing an important step towards the implementation of our growth strategy.” 
According to a company statement, both projects were developed in-house, with the Group’s subsidiary Photon Energy Engineering Australia handling engineering, procurement and construction, and another subsidiary, Photon Energy Operations Australia, set to provide long-term O&M services.

While the $180 million battery’s mammoth scale pales beside other proposals in the pipeline, the project will certainly be one of the most keenly observed undertakings both here and abroad for its deployment of grid-forming technology.
The largest planned grid-forming battery in the world, the Torrens Island project is expected to reveal much about the promising new technology’s capability. German-headquartered company SMA will supply over 100 inverters with grid-forming capabilities for the project, with Josh Birmingham, Director of Large-Scale & Project Solutions at SMA Australia, describing the project as “genuinely cutting edge on a global level.”
“[This] hasn’t been done before,” he told pv magazine Australia. 
Wärtsilä Corporation
Traditionally inverters operate in what’s called grid-following mode, meaning their output synchronises to the grid’s voltage waveform. ‘Grid-forming’ inverters, however, set their own frequencies, making them capable of providing the grid with ‘virtual inertia.’
Also known as virtual synchronous generation, grid-forming technology was flagged by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) just last week as a top priority because of the crucial role the technology is expected to play in the clean energy transition. System strength services and inertia has historically only ever been provided by baseload coal and gas power plants with their reliable outputs, but grid-forming technologies could answer the increasingly desperate need for a clean substitute as the penetration of variable, renewable energy increases.

Responding to AEMO’s new target of getting the Australian grid to accommodate 100% renewable energy at any one time by 2025, Birmingham described grid-forming technology as “how we’re going to get there.”
There are various levels of what grid-forming technology is capable of, Birmingham said. On the most basic level, if the main grid were to go down, a grid-forming system could continue supplying power to its local network. Unlike grid-following systems, it is able to form an islanded grid because it can generate its own frequency reference.
On a higher level, it can function as a “virtual synchronous machine,” meaning it can mimic the inertia services traditionally provided by spinning mass synchronous condensers, “pushing back” in the event of voltage fluctuations in the grid.
The ultimate level though is what’s known as ‘black start’ services. That means in the case of a system black event, the plant would be able to not only restart itself but potentially reenergise an area of the grid by rebooting other assets. This is seen as the pinnacle of what could potentially be offered by grid forming technology and would mark a significant technological advancement.
Getting to the bottom of what, in reality, is plausible will be something projects like the Torrens Island will demonstrate.
The Torrens Island battery will initially operate in grid-following mode, before switching over to become grid-forming. This switch, Birmingham said, is largely because regulatory authorities and the market generally are still in the process of figuring out how to deal with grid-forming technologies. As it stands, market rules and how the services will be monetised remain unclear.
Given that the deployment of the technology is seen by the Operator as top priority, regulatory structures are expected to be expedited.
Syncline Energy, which on Tuesday released plans for the Melton Renewable Energy Hub, a 600 MW/2400 MWh battery storage project just west of Melbourne, has also flagged its plan to deploy grid-forming technologies. The company’s CEO, Phil Galloway, however said he’s waiting for more clarity around regulation before officially moving forward.
Syncline Energy Pty Ltd
It’s worth nothing on Tuesday, AEMO, in conjunction with the Victorian government, began seeking projects for the first stage development of Victoria’s western renewable energy zones. It specifically said the technologies it would consider include virtual synchronous machines and batteries with grid forming inverters, with projects to begin next year. In other words, clarification on rules around grid-forming services can probably be expected sooner rather than later.
As Syncline Energy’s stance already makes evident, Birmingham’s expectation is that in next 12 months many more projects will propose deploying the technology. He described the Torrens Island battery as “the first of many” adding that in a year’s time its scale might not even be in the top five biggest plans.
The news of the grid-forming plans for Torren Island comes hot off the heals of South Australia transmission provider ElectraNet deploying two synchronous condensers in the state, with another two in the woodwork. The primary role of these spinning machines is also to provide system strength and inertia, an example of old tech being redeployed for the new world. In comparison to grid-forming inverters, though, the solution appears far less flexible and unable to offer multiple services. Eyes will certainly be on how the new high-tech inverters perform next to the old and trusted analogue solution.
The Torrens Island battery marks AGL’s first grid-scale storage project with construction set to begin later this year. The project currently includes just one hour of storage but is expected to scale up to four hours or 1000 MWh in future.
For the project, SMA will supply 109 Medium Voltage Power Stations (MVPS-SCS4200) to Wärtsilä. The complex system will also be supported by the GEMS Power Plant Controller and the energy management software from Wärtsilä.

Following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) harrowing report, discussions about community involvement in clean energy future have reignited across Australia.
So the Queensland government’s calls for community feedback on projects for its three renewable energy zones (REZs) seems timely. Leading Australia in terms of REZ development, the state government said it now wants to hear from each of the local communities in the proposed areas about how they want the multi-billion dollar zones to benefit their families, jobs and region.
As part of the REZ project callout last year, 72 projects registered interest in the Southern REZ, while 67 registered interest in the Central REZ, and 53 in the Northern REZ. Queensland Minister for Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen, Mick de Brenni, described community support for the developments as “key.”
“We will ensure that QREZs are developed in a way that maximises community benefits and economic outcomes,” he said.
Queensland’s online survey will remain open until 30 September 2021.
Syncline Energy Pty Ltd
The Victorian government and the Australia Energy Market Operator, which it commissioned to seek its VREZ tenders, appears eager to move at a rather more cracking pace, giving project developers just one week to register their interest.
Stage one projects will focus on developing system strengthen, with AEMO outlining the technology they’re looking for as including actual or virtual synchronous machines, synchronous condensers, batteries with grid forming inverters, or inverter control tuning technologies.
Given that AEMO only put outs its white paper on grid forming inverters last Friday, with regulations around the technology yet to be thought through, the callout doesn’t appear to fear the new and novel.
Developers wanting to register their interest have until August 20, with AEMO setting a mid September deadline for receipt of responses. AEMO will then assess the pool, making a shortlist for the Victorian government before it issues its invitations to tender anticipated in October.
Contracts for the six sought projects are expected to be formalised by the first quarter of 2022, and projects must be up at running by the end of 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/11/harnessing-heat-loss-with-thermionics/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CANADA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 11, 2021",Harnessing heat in solar cells with thermionics,"From pv magazine Global
Energy lost as heat is one of the fundamental, and largely unavoidable, challenges to improving solar cell efficiencies. Heat generated in the device limits the conversion of light into electricity, and also causes degradation of the device, negatively affecting both performance and lifetime.
Thermionics (TI) is an alternate approach that uses heat from the sun to generate electricity, rather than light as in photovoltaics. TI has been known by scientists for a long time, but has not proved itself as practical as PV as a way to generate electricity. However, recently scientists have begun to explore TI effects in solar PV cell materials, and the possibility of combining the two to both increase efficiency and reduce the negative effects of heat on a device – an approach known as photon enhanced thermionic emission (PETE).
The potential of this approach is evaluated in a new paper published in nature communications, Semiconductor thermionics for next generation solar cells: photon enhanced or pure thermionic. The research, led by scientists at Canada’s University of British Columbia, notes that previous work in this area has simplified certain aspects to focus on others – an approach which “does not enable a realistic analysis of these photothermal phenomena and devices based on them,” according to the group.
The group concludes that while both PETE and thermionics alone are promising pathways to addressing the thermal limitations of PV, there is a wide range of challenges to be overcome before it could make any meaningful contributions. These include ensuring temperature stability of the various materials that make up a solar PV cell, increasing the likelihood of thermally excited electrons being emitted and collected, minimising recombination, and many more. “The ultimate challenge is to combine all the desired properties into a single material or heterostructure,” the group states.
The group sought to improve understanding of TI/PETE, and hopes to foster further interest in the approach. “Overall, the concept of semiconductor thermionics is still in early stages and much remains to be investigated on the experimental front,” they conclude, noting that many of the challenges have been identified already. “We point out these issues and possible solutions to both fundamental and practical challenges, in order to provide a broader perspective as well as to motivate further research into semiconductor thermionics.”
