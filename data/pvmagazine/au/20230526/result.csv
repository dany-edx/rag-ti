Sun Cable, which has plans to build up to 20 GW of solar and 42 GWh of energy storage in the Northern Territory that would link to Singapore via a 4,200-kilometre underwater cable, was plunged into voluntary administration earlier this year.
The move was triggered by a disagreement between Cannon-Brookes and mining magnate Andrew Forrest, Sun Cable’s two biggest investors, over the future direction of the company’s estimated $35 billion Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPowerLink) venture.
Squadron Energy, part of Forrest’s private Tattarang Group, no longer supported building the cable to link the project’s renewable energy to Singapore, favouring instead a plan for the clean energy output to be used domestically.
Cannon-Brookes, the co-founder of software giant Atlassian, had however declared his support for Sun Cable’s original plan, including the power link to Asia, and he described the acquisition of the company as “a big step in the right direction.”
“We’ve always believed in the possibilities Sun Cable presents in exporting our boundless sunshine, and what it could mean for Australia,” he said in a statement. “It’s time to stretch our country’s ambition. We need to take big swings if we are going to be a renewable energy superpower. So swing we will.”
Grok said it would now work alongside its investment partners and management to deliver on Sun Cable’s ambitious renewable energy projects.
“Sun Cable has the potential to be a nation-building project for Australia, generating and transmitting critical clean energy to Singapore and supply renewable energy to new Northern Territory industries,” the company said.
“We believe Sun Cable can achieve long-term success by delivering globally competitive electrons to Australia and the world. We will continue to pursue customer off-take agreements in Singapore and Darwin and collaborate with the Singaporean and Northern Territory governments to achieve this mission.”
“We are excited to do this with a group of old and new investors to Sun Cable, who bring significant experience to renewables project delivery, and who will assist management.”
Grok said the consortium will “deep dive” with Sun Cable management over the coming weeks and would have more to say about the design and development priorities of the Sun Cable project moving forward.
David Scaysbrook, Australian-based co-founder and managing partner of Quinbrook, said the company is pleased to have supported Grok in the successful acquisition of Sun Cable and is well positioned to help deliver the AAPowerLink venture, which he described as “a visionary undertaking by any measure.”
“Quinbrook is one of the world’s leading investors in the sustainable infrastructure needed to drive the energy transition and brings considerable experience in the successful development of innovative, mega-scale renewables projects around the world,” he said. “With construction well underway on the largest solar+storage projects ever undertaken in the U.S. and the U.K., it is well positioned to assist Grok to complete the development of what promises to be not only one of the largest renewables projects in Australia, but a project of global significance.”

Designed and built by Planet Ark Power, the $6.6 million (USD 4.3 million) solar and storage microgrid will be owned and operated by South Australia-headquartered energy infrastructure company Epic Energy.
Epic Energy Chief Executive Officer Clive D’Cruz said the system is not only providing power to the Ikea Adelaide store but will also provide support to the South Australia’s electricity network with the battery allowing the operator to ‘time-shift’ solar energy.
D’Cruz said surplus clean energy stored in the microgrid’s battery can be traded into the National Electricity Market (NEM) during hours of peak demand, supporting grid stability and reliability through participation in Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) markets.
“Investing in Australia’s first-of-its-type urban microgrid supports our offtake partner Ikea in achieving their climate-positive goals while benefiting the local community through supporting grid stability,” he said.
Planet Ark Power Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Ruddick said the integration of the company’s eleXsys technology has transformed the Ikea store into an “unconstrained, grid-connected commercial microgrid.”
“The microgrid not only maximises clean energy generation in SA, but also avoids expensive network upgrades and provides grid support to the state’s electricity network, benefitting the wider South Australian community,” he said.
“Use of the eleXsys technology means being able to connect to up to 10 times more energy than solar technology and grid constraints currently allow.”

Ruddick said the capacity to actively trade renewable energy into the South Australian power network also provides a risk-reduced return on investment for the microgrid’s owners.
South Australia has one of the highest rates of rooftop solar penetration in the world, which, combined with wind generation, regularly meets 100% of the state’s energy needs but Department for Energy and Mining Major Projects Director Scott Oster said he is hopeful the project inspires other major retailers to play their part in the state’s energy transition.
“The South Australian government is excited to see this project demonstrate how smart technology will mean we can accommodate more rooftop solar in ways that actually help our grid stability,” he said.
“This is another critical step in South Australia delivering a smart energy grid of the future. It is innovative solutions and forward-thinking like this that will be vitally important as we approach our target of 100% renewables by 2030.”
For Ikea, the microgrid will support the company’s goal of 100% renewable energy use at the Adelaide store by 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/26/iea-report-reveals-shift-to-clean-energy-accelerating/,"EV,FINANCE,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 26, 2023",IEA report reveals shift to clean energy accelerating,"Global investment in solar power is expected to outstrip spending on oil production for the first time this year as clean energy spending outpaces that for fossil fuels, according to a report issued by the International Energy Agency (IEA).
In its latest World Energy Investment report, the IEA says about $4.3 trillion is set to be invested globally in energy in 2023, of which more than $2.61 trillion is expected to go to clean energy technologies, including renewable power, transmission infrastructure, energy storage, low-emissions fuels and electric vehicles (EVs).
The remainder, slightly more than $1.54 trillion, is going to coal, gas and oil.
IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said annual clean energy investment is expected to rise by 24% between 2021 and 2023 compared with a 15% rise in fossil fuel investment over the same period.
“Clean energy is moving fast, faster than many people realise,” he said. “This is clear in the investment trends, where clean technologies are pulling away from fossil fuels.”
“For every dollar invested in fossil fuels, about 1.7 dollars are now going into clean energy. Five years ago, this ratio was one-to-one. One shining example is investment in solar, which is set to overtake the amount of investment going into oil production for the first time.”

In 2023, solar power spending is due to reach about $583 billion (USD 380 billion) on a yearly basis while the IEA expects investment in oil exploration and extraction should come in at $568 billion (USD 370 billion).
“Solar is the star performer,” the IEA said. “More than USD 1 billion per day is expected to go into solar investments in 2023.”
Led by solar, low-emissions electricity technologies are expected to account for almost 90% of investment in power generation. The IEA said consumers are also investing in more electrified end-uses with global heat pump sales producing double-digit annual growth since 2021 while EV sales are expected to leap by a third this year after already surging in 2022.
The IEA said the rise in clean energy investments has been boosted by a variety of factors, including high oil and gas prices and a worry about supplies, and enhanced policy support through instruments like the US Inflation Reduction Act.
National energy security goals, decarbonisation targets, and a focus on industrial strategy as countries seek to strengthen their footholds in the emerging clean energy economy have also contributed.
More than 90% of the increase in clean energy investments comes from advanced economies and China, with much less in less wealthy nations. The IEA said factors such as high interest rates, weak electricity grid infrastructure and unclear policies are holding back investments in renewable energy in many countries.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/26/funding-confirmed-for-3-gw-green-hydrogen-project/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,JAPAN,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 26, 2023",Funding confirmed for 3 GW green hydrogen project,"The Australian and Queensland governments have united with a consortium of Australian and Japanese energy companies to make the “largest investment in a renewable hydrogen project of its kind in the nation’s history”, committing $117 million to fund further development of the Central Queensland Hydrogen (CQ-H2) project at Gladstone.
The CQ-H2 project is being developed by Queensland-government owned generator Stanwell in conjunction with Japanese energy companies Iwatani, Kansai Electric Power Corporation, Marubeni, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and Sydney-based energy infrastructure business APA Group.
The consortium partners have today committed $81.8 million to fund the Front End Engineering Design (FEED) for the CQ-H2 project, which would eventually include 3 GW of electrolyser capacity capable of producing up to of 800 tonnes of green hydrogen per day for export to Japan and use in local industry.
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) will provide $20 million in funding, while $15 million will be provided by the Queensland government.
The study will also investigate the development of a hydrogen liquefaction facility based at the Port of Gladstone that will produce 400 tonnes per day of liquefied hydrogen for export by the end of 2030.
Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen said successful completion of the FEED will bring the project one step closer to a final investment decision, planned for late 2024.
“Projects like this are critical to scaling up Australia’s green hydrogen industry,” Bowen said. “The government is committed to making Australia a global hydrogen leader and projects like the CQ-H2 project could lead the way in exporting renewable hydrogen to the international market.”
“Japan, Korea and China are three of our largest trading partners and have all made clear commitments to increase the use of hydrogen, with a focus on establishing international supply chains for imports.”
It is anticipated the CQ-H2 project, being developed at Aldoga, about 20 kilometres northwest of Gladstone, would initially involve the installation of up to 640 MW of electrolysers to produce 73,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per annum by 2028. The electrolyser capacity is to ramp up to 3 GW, producing to 292,000 tonnes per annum by 2031. The hydrogen would then be liquified or converted to ammonia for export to Japan and potentially local industry offtake.
ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said Australia is well positioned to capitalise on export opportunities to Asia, however, unlocking it will require the rapid development of substantial hydrogen production and export facilities at a globally cost competitive price point.
“Stanwell’s project represents a near-term renewable hydrogen production opportunity at globally significant scale,” he said. “The development of a renewable hydrogen hub in Gladstone could help decarbonise heavy industrial facilities in the region and create an export supply chain between Australia and Japan and Singapore.”
Miller said the CQ-H2 project could provide “valuable learnings around the current cost of producing hydrogen from renewable energy at large-scale.”
“This understanding is critical to scaling up hydrogen production in Australia and developing both the domestic and export industry for renewable hydrogen in line with Australia’s ambitions,” he said.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the CQ-H2 project will help establish the state as a global hydrogen heavyweight and unlock huge economic opportunities with estimates indicating the project will generate almost 9,000 jobs and more than $17.2 billion in hydrogen exports over its 30-year life.
“Green hydrogen is the next resource frontier for a world hungry for renewables, and it’s Queensland’s green hydrogen industry that will ensure the greatest climate, jobs, and export opportunity in a generation,” he said.
“We are writing a new chapter and carving our own path to ensure Queensland’s mighty sun, wind and water are leveraged to help decarbonise our nation, and the world.”
The funding for the FEED comes after a $10.4 million feasibility study found the proposed CQ-H2 project is technically feasible and commercially viable “with appropriate government support in the initial phases.”
Stanwell has already secured a 236-hectare site at Aldoga for the hydrogen production base and a ~100-hectare site is to be acquired at the Port of Gladstone to serve as a hydrogen liquefaction and loading base.
A memorandum of understanding has also been signed that allows for a direct connection to be established between the hydrogen production facility and Spanish renewable energy company Acciona Energia’s proposed 600 MWp Aldoga Solar Farm.
Acciona has previously said construction of the Aldoga Solar Farm is due to commence later this year with generation output scheduled to commence in December 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/26/victoria-introduces-dynamic-export-rule-for-rooftop-solar/,"INVERTERS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 26, 2023",Victoria introduces dynamic export rule for rooftop solar,"State government agency Solar Victoria has confirmed that under new rules to take effect from March next year, all new inverters installed under its programs will need to be capable of remotely and dynamically adjusting PV export limits to help network operators maintain grid stability.
In the latest annual Notice to Market published this week, Solar Victoria said it will be mandatory from 1 March 2024 for inverters installed under its Solar Homes and Solar for Business programs to be ‘dynamic export’ capable to allow for the future implementation of flexible export arrangements by distributed network service providers (DNSPs).
“A solar PV system installed today will likely not include an inverter capable of modulating how much solar energy is exported to the grid,” the agency said. “Without this dynamic export functionality, DNSPs may set a low static export limit, which can result in solar energy not being utilised.”
Solar Victoria said effective 1 March 2024, PV inverters installed through the Solar Homes program must be compliant with IEEE 2030.5 and Common Smart Inverter Profile (CSIP)-AUS protocol.
The move mirrors that of South Australia with the state government to progressively roll out its new dynamic export program as a standard service offering from July 2023.
South Australian rooftop solar owners can currently export 5 kW of electricity to the grid but the new inverter standards there will give households the option to export up to 10 kW, in return for allowing the network operator to remotely curtail those export limits to manage grid stability.
Solar Victoria said the new inverter rule was one of five new mandatory requirements and seven new recommendations outlined in the annual Notice to Market which provides the solar industry in the state with the standards and requirements it must meet to be able to be part of Solar Victoria’s programs.
The agency said the new mandatory requirements are aimed at maximising the self-consumption of excess solar through electric hot water systems and heat pumps including mandating timers to optimise solar self-consumption and ensuring suitability and quality of heat pumps for climatic conditions and suitable sizing.
The new requirements also strengthen retailers’ ability to respond to product safety recalls; and strengthen consumer protections through warranties, as well as mandating the requirement for all solar and battery retailers to be New Energy Tech Approved Sellers.
The new recommendations relate to improving grid integration, solar grid hosting and safety through compliance with the relevant standards; improving performance warranties for solar PV panels and batteries; ensuring appropriately sized hot water heat pumps are installed; and enabling customers to view their solar generation and energy consumption.
“With the speed of innovation in solar and technologies supported under Solar Homes and the dynamic market we work in it is important that we are always looking to the future and maximising the benefits for our solar customers and integration with the transforming electricity grid,” Solar Victoria Chief Executive Stan Krpan said.
“The new requirements will help deliver the best safety and quality outcomes for Victorians who are enthusiastically making the move to all-electric homes.”
Solar Victoria said the Notice to Market 2023-24 comes into effect on 1 July 2023, with some requirements coming into effect at later dates. The current Notice to Market remains in effect until 30 June 2023.

China’s PV module, cell, and wafer exports surged by 64% to USD 52 billion ($79 billon) in 2022, according to market research firm Wood Mackenzie.
Last year, China exported 154 GW of modules, with Europe remaining the top market, accounting for a 56% share. Chinese modules were also 57% cheaper than those produced in the United States and the European Union, according to Wood Mackenzie.
The upward trend continues, with Europe importing approximately 29.5 GW of Chinese modules in the first quarter of this year, based on information obtained by pv magazine. Wafer shipments rose 44% to 41 GW, while solar cell exports exceeded 24 GW. Southeast Asia secured 31% of the cells manufactured in China.
“US tariffs on Chinese-made modules have driven module production to Southeast Asia, where many manufacturing facilities import cells from China,” said Wood Mackenzie.
The report’s authors noted that the cost advantage of Chinese companies challenges offshoring policies in the United States, the European Union, and India. China’s wafer and cell export capacity is expected to surpass 230 GW by 2026, exceeding global demand outside of China. By 2026, China’s available module export capacity is projected to gradually increase to 149 GW.
“The US is counting on the [Inflation Reduction Act], which will allocate at least USD 41 billion ($62 billion) to stimulate domestic manufacturing. But costs still favour imported modules, and even as more local module production comes online in coming years, there will be persistent dependence on imports of components from Asia,” said Alex Whitworth, research director for Wood Mackenzie. “In Europe, the EU is advocating trade restrictions to secure local PV manufacturing but lacks specific policies to propel capacity build‑outs and displace imports. India also has great ambitions to expand its PV manufacturing, but financial support is insufficient to reach aggressive targets.”
