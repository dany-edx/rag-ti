https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/21/why-the-federal-court-case-against-santos-could-have-wide-reaching-ramifications/,"LEGAL,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2021",Why the federal court case against Santos could have wide-reaching ramifications,"Acting on behalf of shareholder advocacy organisation, the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), the Environmental Defenders Office in August filed a federal court case against Australia’s largest gas supplier, Santos. It’s claiming the oil and gas giant’s branding of itself as “clean energy” provider on the path to net zero by 2040 is not credible and constitutes deceptive conduct under Australian consumer law.
It is the first court case in the world to challenge the veracity of a company’s net zero targets by applying longstanding consumer laws. The case is seeking to expose corporate greenwashing and legally scrutinise the promises of carbon capture and storage technologies and blue hydrogen which numerous fossil fuel companies rely on in their planned pathways to net zero.
While the case, which had its first court date today, only seeks to challenge the claims made by single company, Brynn O’Brien, the Executive Director of the ACCR, told pv magazine Australia the proceedings could have broad implications, which might just reach all the way down to how companies are permitted to use language.
The case rests on Australia’s well established consumer laws which prohibit companies from misleading and deceptive conduct. “It’s the application of those laws that is novel,” Elaine Johnson, the Environmental Defenders Office’s Director of Legal Strategy, told pv magazine Australia.
Basically, the case is seeking to use those laws to expose greenwashing, which is when companies give a false impression of their sustainability practices. O’Brien described greenwashing in Australian corporations’ climate commitments as a “massive issue”.
For instance, Santos claims it has a pathway to net zero despite the fact it is actually expanding its fossil fuel operations in coming years. It is far from the only company to do so, with other major players like Origin following suit.
This outward touting of sustainability while continuing to pursue projects which emit carbon dioxide, O’Brien said, gives investors and society a false sense of security and hope, signalling corporations have the matter at hand “when that is so far from the case”.
Just last Friday, Greenpeace released its report Hero to zero: uncovering the truth of corporate Australia’s climate action claims, which came to a similar conclusion. It found that while 80 of Australia’s top emitting companies have now set net zero targets, just 16 had actually committed to reducing emissions from their operations by switching to 100% renewable electricity.
The Santos case, O’Brien hopes, will be something of a fact finding exercise – putting these abstract targets under real legal scrutiny to uncover credibility and therefore open the door for other companies to have their claims challenged through the court system.
Santos is far from alone in its touting of gas as a “clean” energy source, with our very own federal government using the same language.
O’Brien said she believes Australia has a serious problem around language use. “It’s untruthful for the government to say gas or fossil hydrogen is clean,” she said. “It’s just not right.”
Right as in scientifically sound. Which is why the ACCR believes Santos’ and indeed perhaps other bodies use of words could be classed as legally deceptive.
Johnson agrees, saying that under the law consumers are entitled to information that is supportable. “[It’s] important to ensure there is truth in advertising and communication,” the EDO director said.
She believes the world is on the cusp of an explosion of climate litigation, with all kinds of avenues to be pursued as governments and corporations either drag their heels or make claims they either can’t or won’t back up with real action.
“The courts are a place often of last resort, so when people and society and communities feel they can’t get justice and equity through other courses of engaging in dialogue, then courts are the places these issues ultimately end up and we’re seeing this with climate change,” Johnson said.

The Australian-based company claims its technology could increase the capacity of fuel cells by up to 60% and is now bringing the tech into the proof of concept stage in which it will undergo this independent validation process.
“The technology facilitates a more efficient electrochemical reaction in the fuel cell, which means more available energy is produced from the same amount of hydrogen,” David Vinson, Chairman of Titan Hydrogen Limited, said in a statement.
Vinson said interim results from the QUT testing process are expected by the end of the year, with the research team led by Dr Andrew Dicks in collaboration with Associate Professor Geoffrey Will.
“The development will investigate the fundamental processes occurring within fuel cells using both electrochemistry and analytical techniques to validate fully the Titan fuel cell concept in which a novel nano-structured membrane is at the heart of the fuel cell,” Dr Dicks said. 
“The aim of the work is to create a new type of hydrogen fuel cell that is not limited by losses caused by the high overpotentials experienced in currently available devices,” he added.
The efficiency of low temperature Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cells is currently low and may convert less than 40% of hydrogen’s energy into electricity.
 This low conversion efficiency is a vital hurdle for fuel cell technology to overcome to make hydrogen a viable transport fuel. Currently the ‘round trip’ efficiency of using hydrogen to store electricity can be as low as 50%, compared to batteries which can reach 90%.
Titan Hydrogen, which hasn’t received much press to date, claims its technology marks a “breakthrough” in overcoming this. “The Holy Grail for the hydrogen industry is to figure out a way to use less hydrogen to get the same output of energy. We think our fuel cell technology is on the verge of doing that,” the company’s chairman said.
“If the cells show that they can produce more efficient energy, this will validate our technology and be a great first step for Titan and its investors,” Vinson added.
“The technology has application across global automotive, marine and heavy trucking industries. The technology can ultimately be applied to any fuel cell.”
Titan is currently undertaking a pre-IPO raise ahead of its goal of launching an IPO and becoming a publicly listed company in 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/21/hydrogen-hub-shortlist-expanded-as-feds-commit-additional-150-million/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2021",Hydrogen hub shortlist expanded as feds commit additional $150 million,"The federal government has pledged an additional $150 million for hydrogen project grants while expanding its prospective regional hydrogen hubs shortlist from five to seven to include one regional industrial centre per state.
The seven locations identified by the federal government include:
The intention behind federal government’s Clean Hydrogen Industrial Hubs program is to co-locate hydrogen production facilities with industrial users, and building on preexisting industry infrastructure and regional workforces.
The Australian Hydrogen Council welcomed the move, with its CEO, Dr Fiona Simon, saying to decision to increase the number of hubs is good news for getting Australia’s burgeoning hydrogen industry to scale since hubs drive collaboration and shared benefit.
While WWF-Australia’s Energy Transition Manager, Nicky Ison, also welcomed the new investments, she said they don’t go far enough to capture the full potential Australia has to become a world leader in renewable energy exports.
“Indeed Australia is being outspent by other countries. Germany, for instance, is investing $10 billion in renewable hydrogen,” Ison said.
With the additional $150 million, the Australian federal government’s grant program now totals $464 million. The program will provide up to $3 million grants for project consortia to initially progress feasibility and design work, and up to $70 million towards the roll-out of projects.
While its hydrogen program is open Australia-wide, the federal government said “the seven locations have been identified based on strong interest and activity from industry and each location’s existing capabilities, infrastructure and resources,” presumably meaning projects based in these locations will be prioritised.
The creation of hubs is considered vital to establish scale in hydrogen, with Ison saying centres of heavy industry like Bell Bay, Gladstone and the Hunter “have the potential to be not just hydrogen hubs but renewable energy industrial precincts that use renewable hydrogen to meet the growing Australian and global demand for commodities like steel and aluminium that have been manufactured using renewable energy.”
Australia’s federal government estimates the “clean” hydrogen industry (the term it uses to lump fossil fuel hydrogen with carbon capture and storage in with legitimately renewable green hydrogen) could generate over $11 billion a year in GDP by 2050.
Analysis by ACIL Allen co-funded by WWF and Beyond Zero Emissions, however, is more optimistic, saying investment in hydrogen hubs and renewable energy industrial precincts in Gladstone and the Hunter could create $13 billion in annual revenue by 2032.
The federal government’s “stretch goal” is to get hydrogen production in Australia to under $2 a kilogram, labelling the objective “H2 under 2.”
“We are accelerating the development of our Australian hydrogen industry and it is our ambition to produce the cheapest clean hydrogen in the world, transforming our transport, energy, resources and manufacturing sectors,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement.
“Hydrogen hubs are crucial to realising the Morrison government’s vision of making Australia a major global player in hydrogen production and exports by 2030,” Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Angus Taylor, added.
“We are looking to partner with industry, and work with state and territory governments to make this a reality.
The federal government’s program guidelines are available at business.gov.au, with applications to open in the coming weeks.

U.S. start-up EnerVenue has raised US$100 million (AU$138 million) in series A funding led by U.S. investment firm Schlumberger New Energy and Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures (SAEV), the strategic technology venturing program of Saudi state-run energy company Saudi Aramco.
“The company will use funding from the series A [round] to build a gigafactory in the United States, accelerate R&D efforts, and expand its sales force as it scales its distribution capabilities with strategic partnerships like the one announced with Schlumberger New Energy,” EnerVenue said in a statement, adding that the U.S. investment firm will also help expand its distribution channels in the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and other regions.
The company’s nickel-hydrogen battery technology is claimed to be able to operate at temperatures between -40 and 60 degrees Celsius, over a 30-year period. The manufacturer also says it can provide over 30,000 cycles without degradation and at varying rates, for a wide range of fast and slow charge capabilities. The battery has an efficiency ranging from 80 to 90%, depending on the cycle rate, and its energy density per square foot is equal to, or better than lithium-ion batteries, according to the company.
“EnerVenue builds durable, flexible, and safe energy storage solutions with batteries based on technology proven over decades of use under the most extreme aerospace conditions – including powering the International Space Station and Hubble Space Telescope,” the statement reads. “Following breakthrough material science discoveries that significantly [reduce] the cost and [increase] the raw material availability of the NASA-originated technology, EnerVenue launched in 2020, to bring the battery’s established advantages to grid scale and other stationary power applications.”
Conventional nickel-hydrogen batteries have been, so far, largely applied extensively in aerospace applications, such as in satellites and aircraft, and have shown good reliability, stability, and durability. Their utilisation for terrestrial applications, however, is still hampered by the high costs of the platinum catalysts used for their production. The U.S. Department of Energy is targeting to reduce the cost of these devices to $100/kWh for stationary storage.

British renewables developer Lightsource BP today announced it had secured US$1.8 billion (AU$2.5 billion) in revolving credit lines from ten of the world’s biggest lenders, to finance its plans to hit 25 GW of solar project capacity by 2025.
The London-based business, which is half owned by British energy company BP, said the finance package – which includes trade credit, which offers the user the chance to take goods and pay later – had been secured from lenders in France, Spain, the U.K., Japan, Canada, and the U.S.
The credit facilities will be provided by French banks BNP Paribas and Société Générale; Spanish institution Santander; U.K. government-controlled NatWest and domestic peer Lloyds; Japanese institutions Mitsubishi UFJ and Sumitomo Mitsui; Canadian financiers Canadian Imperial and Toronto Dominion; and U.S. brand Wells Fargo. A press release issued by Lightsource BP this morning did not indicate how much each lender had contributed to the package.
The clean energy company estimated its 25 GW push will create around 500 jobs over the next four years and said it had developed 3.8 GW of solar capacity since forerunner Lightsource was founded, 11 years ago.
Lightsource group chief executive Nick Boyle, quoted in the press release, said: “Globally, renewable energy is shifting from a mindset of gigawatts to terawatts. Investments are being made by the billion, not the million. And big companies like Amazon, McDonald’s and eBay are switching to clean energy. This trend proves that renewables are mainstream and solar is playing a key role in addressing the climate crisis. If we’re going to meet the commitments of the Paris Agreement, business as usual isn’t going to cut it. Our industry-leading 25 GW by 2025 target, and the finance package, are further proof that Lightsource BP has left business as usual far behind.”
Lightsource joint owner BP in June announced it would spend US$220 million (AU$30 million) “and 1 GW of ‘safe harbour’ equipment” to acquire a 9 GW solar portfolio in the U.S. from Texas-based developer 7X Energy, with Lightsource BP to develop the project capacity. Lightsource today indicated that 9 GW is not included in its 25 GW target.
