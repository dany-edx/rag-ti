Alinta’s Pilbara assets include the 60 MW Chichester Solar Farm, the 178 MW gas and diesel-fired Newman Power Station and associated 35 MW battery, and the 210 MW gas-fired Port Hedland power station. It also includes 200 kilometres of high-voltage transmission lines and a share in the Goldfields gas transmission pipeline, which can transport 203 terajoules a day.
The development pipeline includes the 45 MW solar farm and 35 MW one-hour battery energy storage system being constructed at Port Hedland.
The portfolio also includes 900 MW worth of renewables and storage products under development, including a 30 MW extension to the Chichester solar farm, an expansion of the Port Hedland solar and battery projects, and a series of new wind projects totalling more than 800 MW.
APA Chief Executive and Managing Director Adam Watson said the acquisition is consistent with the gas pipeline giant’s decarbonisation strategy and links directly with it focus on customers in Australia’s resources sector.
“The acquisition of Alinta Energy Pilbara delivers APA a significant new growth platform in the attractive remote-grid energy sector,” he said.
“It allows us to leverage our existing skills in operating large-scale gas, renewables and storage infrastructure, and provides the opportunity to capitalise on the increasing need for reliable, affordable and lower emissions energy as the resources sector continues to decarbonise.”
APA intends to raise $675 million through a pro rata institutional placement and a $75 million share purchase plan. The balance of the purchase price will be funded by new debt facilities established in connection with the acquisition.
Completion of the sale remains subject to certain conditions but is expected to be finalised later this year.
Alinta said the sale will allow it to focus on the delivery of its other renewables and storage projects, including the 1 GW Spinifex offshore wind project in Victoria, and the 900 MW Oven Mountain pumped hydro project in New South Wales.
Alinta, owned by Hong Kong-based Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, said the company’s assets and operations in southwest WA, including its retail gas operations and projects including the recently announced 100 MW Wagerup big battery, are not impacted by the sale.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/23/big-batteries-reach-new-high-as-generation-investment-slows/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 23, 2023",Big batteries reach new high as generation investment slows,"New data from the Clean Energy Council (CEC) shows $2 billion (USD 1.29 billion) worth of large-scale energy storage and hybrid projects reached the financial commitment stage in the three months to the end of June 2023, with six projects totalling 1497 MW/3802 MWh added across Australia.
While energy storage investment reached a record high, the spend on generation projects has had its slowest first half of the year since the CEC began tracking project data in 2017.
Only four generation projects, totalling a combined investment value of $225 million, reached financial commitment in the April-June period. The four projects, the largest among them Octopus Australia’s 175 MW solar and 400 MWh battery project in Queensland’s Western Downs region, total 348 MW of generation capacity.
While this result was an improvement on the first quarter, when only one large-scale generation project reached financial commitment, the CEC’s latest renewable projects quarterly report shows investment levels this year are 50% below the rolling 12-month quarterly average of 699 MW and well adrift of what is required to reach Australia’s 2030 renewable energy goals.

CEC Chief Executive Kane Thornton said there is strong political support for the clean energy transition but under investment in transmission, grid connection challenges, inconsistent planning policies, and constraints in supply chains and workforce are all barriers for renewables investors and developers.
“These challenges make final investment decisions for large-scale renewables projects more difficult,” he said.
“There is an enormous pipeline of renewable energy projects in Australia, but investors are swamped with global opportunity at a time where these barriers make Australian projects less attractive.”
Thornton said the development needed to achieve 82% renewable generation by 2030 “is not guaranteed unless we target the obstacles currently creating investment uncertainty for new energy generation.”

Despite the slowdown in investments in generation projects, construction activity remains strong with four generation projects commencing construction during the quarter.
The projects, including Zenith Energy’s 88 MW wind, solar and storage project being built at Bellevue Gold’s mining operation in Western Australia, will deliver nearly 1.2 GW of generation capacity.
Nine generation and storage projects reached the final commissioning stage in the quarter. The five generation projects, including Greek resources and renewables company Mytilineos’ 110 MWp Moura Solar Farm in central Queensland, contributed a total of 551 MW of generation capacity.
The storage projects, which include the 150 MW/150 MWh Hazelwood big battery developed in Victoria by French energy giant Engie, and its partners Eku Energy and Fluence, provided an additional was 305 MW/460 MWh worth of energy storage.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/23/catl-unveils-ev-battery-enabling-400km-driving-range-on-10-minute-charge/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",VALERIE THOMPSON,"AUGUST 23, 2023",CATL unveils EV battery enabling 400km driving range on 10-minute charge,"Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) has announced a new fast-charging lithium iron phosphate (LFP) electric vehicle (EV) battery that it claims is capable of driving 400km on a 10-minute charge.
The Chinese battery manufacturer said the Shenxing battery enables a 700km driving range on a full charge. The performance level is a first for a battery with an output four times the rated ampere-hour rating of its maximum current (4C), according to the company.
Safety features include an upgraded electrolyte, a separator with a safety coating, and temperature-regulating algorithms.
At room temperature, the battery is said to charge to 80% state of charge in 10 minutes. In colder weather, when temperatures are as low as -10 C, its temperature control technology rapidly heats cells to the optimal operating range, enabling a 0 to 80% charge within 30 minutes.
The company also said the battery technology enables quick extraction of lithium ions and rapid response to charging signals, including a graphite innovation that improved the lithium-ion intercalation rate by modifying graphite surface properties to increase intercalation channels, shorten intercalation distances, and reduce resistance.
Furthermore, its electrolyte formula purportedly reduces the viscosity of the electrolyte to improve conductivity, and a thinner solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film also reduces the lithium-ion movement resistance.
“The upgraded electrolyte and the separator with a highly safe coating are used to provide a dual protection of the Shenxing battery,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “By regulating the global temperature field inside the cells using intelligent algorithms, CATL has built a real-time fault testing system that can solve the problems brought about by fast refuelling, enabling a high level of safety for the Shenxing battery.”
In April, CATL unveiled a new ultra-high energy battery technology initially slated for aviation, and with an automotive cell under development. The so-called “condensed matter” battery, a type of semi-solid state product with condensed electrolyte and new anode and separator materials, will have an energy density of up to 500 Wh/kg.
In 2021, CATL rolled out its first-generation sodium-ion battery with an energy density of 160 Wh/kg and promised an increase to 200 Wh/kg for the next generation.
In 2022, CATL unveiled Qilin battery, the third generation of its cell-to-pack technology, claiming the highest integration level to date. With a record-breaking volume utilization efficiency of 72% and an energy density of up to 255 Wh/kg, Qilin is reportedly capable of delivering a range of over 1,000 km and equating to a five-minute hot start and ten minutes of charging to get from 10-80% state of charge.
The Chinese battery manufacturer produced 37% of the world’s electric-vehicle batteries and 43.4% of energy storage batteries in 2022 for a grand total of 289 GWh.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/23/scientists-outline-innovation-pathways-for-pv-technologies/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"AUGUST 23, 2023",Scientists outline innovation pathways for PV technologies,"Ten scientists have projected the innovation pathways for the major PV cell technologies over the next five years, in an open-access article in the journal Cell.
Although installed PV capacity worldwide exceeds 1 TW (1,000 GW), PV’s contribution to worldwide electricity generation remains small, the authors say, at 5% to 6%. Given an “urgent need” to deploy PV at multi-terawatt scale over the next two decades to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, “PV device innovation takes on new urgency and impact.”
Continued research that leads to “even relatively small advances” in efficiency, reliability and manufacturing efficiency “will have major future impacts at multi-TW scale,” the authors say, as these factors combine to make “the increasingly compelling value proposition” for PV power generation.
While crystalline silicon PV had a 95% market share in 2022, in a “TW-scale future” with “PV everywhere,” multiple technologies may be complementary, or combined, the authors say.
The silicon PV technology known as TOPCon (tunnel oxide passivating contact), with a market share of 23%, will “overcome” production of PERC (passivated emitter and rear cell) PV by 2025 and “is likely to become the technology of choice for new-cell manufacturing in the US,” the article predicts.
Crystalline silicon PV cells are approaching the single-junction theoretical maximum efficiency of 29.4%, the authors say.
Research is still needed, they note, to develop high-temperature, selective area passivating contacts on both sides of the PV cell (“advanced TOPCon”), to improve the transparency and conductivity of heterojunction technology (HJT) contacts (“advanced HJT”), and to combine the latest HJT or TOPCon technologies with an interdigitated back contact (IBC) structure, “which could reach an ultimate practical efficiency of 28% possibly as soon as 2025.”
Yet as the theoretical limit is approached, “several new modes of degradation, called carrier-induced degradation, and metastable defects are unveiled,” the authors say.
The industry “is working to reduce or eliminate” the use of scarce materials such as silver for the formation of grid lines and indium used in transparent conductive oxides, the authors say. Several PV companies and research laboratories have announced HJT PV cell design with reduced indium consumption “or even indium-free” HJT cells.
Tandem technology
Many technologies for tandem solar cells have been proposed to overcome the single-junction efficiency limit, the authors say.
Development of monolithic 2-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem cells, “considered by many as the most probable and cost-effective solution,” is currently the most active research area, and has already yielded a record cell efficiency of 33.7% for a small-area (1 square centimetre) cell.
For a 30% efficient 2-terminal tandem cell, “the efficiency of the top cell is significantly more critical than the efficiency of the bottom cell,” so “a potential contender as a bottom cell” would include “almost any” silicon cell technology.
While “there is no doubt” that efficiencies greater than 30% will soon be commercially available on large-area cells, “stability still needs to be improved,” the authors say. To reach the same levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) as established “bankable” technologies, “the tandem device may only degrade less than 0.5% per year.”
Cadmium telluride
Cadmium telluride (CdTe) PV technology accounts for 25% of installed U.S. utility-scale PV, but only 5% of global market share. The researchers projected, based on a First Solar cell with arsenic-doped material that reached 22.3% efficiency, that Cd (Se,Te) cells doped with a Group V material “will become the primary platform for research, development and manufacturing.”
CIGS
Turning to CIGS technology, whose original formulation used copper, indium, gallium and selenium, the authors say that the combination of CIGS in tandem applications is “one major focus of future developments.” CIGS tandem devices “are not limited to pairing CIGS with perovskites,” they add, as “they may be made with numerous materials including CdTe-, Si-, or CIGS-based alloys with different band gaps.”
Multi-junction III-V
Multi-junction III-V PV cells are described by the U.S. Department of Energy as cells that can reach efficiencies over 45% by using multiple bandgaps, or junctions, that are each tuned to absorb a specific region of the solar spectrum. Multi-junction III-V PV cells could enable “significant space-based power generation,” the authors say.
The article, written by five scientists from the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory and five others from First Solar and research institutes in Germany, the U.S. and China, is titled “Photovoltaic device innovation for a solar future.”
Three of the co-authors contributed to an article in the journal Science earlier this year titled “Photovoltaics at multi-terawatt scale: Waiting is not an option.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/23/solar-installer-convicted-on-false-certificates-scheme/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",TRISTAN RAYNER,"AUGUST 23, 2023",Solar installer convicted on false certificates scheme,"An Australian solar installer has been convicted after a scheme to falsify the installation or supervision over 13 solar PV systems.
Aaron Ware, director of Pedley’s Electrical Services Pty Ltd, pleaded guilty this month in the Brisbane Magistrates Court, to 13 offences of making a false or misleading statement under the Commonwealth Criminal Code. Ware was convicted and released on a 12-month good behaviour bond.
Ware was investigated by the Clean Energy Regulator (CER), with the results finding that between October 2018 and January 2020, Ware received a financial benefit by falsely claiming to have installed or supervised 13 solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. The CER found Ware was overseas at the time. A press release from the CER notes that “Ware submitted 13 false or misleading Small-scale Technology Certificate (STC) assignment forms along with certificates of electrical safety to renewable energy certificate agents. The agents relied upon this information to improperly create 1,637 STCs for the solar PV systems. In return for the right to create these STCs, the agents paid Mr Ware in the order of $60,000.”
Ware has had his CEC accreditation cancelled, and Piet Powell, general manager of the CER’s Compliance Branch, said the CER continues to protect its schemes’ integrity by prosecuting and removing those who benefit from wilful fraud.
“The conduct investigated and prosecuted here predates the integrity review into rooftop solar and the CER’s campaign to raise awareness about installer attendance obligations,” said Powell.
“Those who now attempt to benefit from making false statements regarding STC eligibility can expect greater penalties than what Mr Ware received. We will continue to remove from the scheme those responsible for providing false and misleading information and, where appropriate, commence criminal prosecutions or civil penalty proceedings.”
The CER also noted in its press release that changes to the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Regulations 2001 provide the CER additional powers to disqualify installers and designers, retailers and component manufacturers from participating in the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme.
