The $170 million project also includes a 10 MW/20 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) but New Energy project developer Dan Flynn said there is scope to expand that to 75 MW/150 MWh and it is increasingly likely that will occur.
Flynn said with Australia’s energy market transitioning to a future increasingly reliant on storage to firm up the expanding volume of renewable energy, it is likely the storage component of the project will be increased before the solar farm comes online.
“It’s a huge consideration at the moment,” he said.
“It’s very likely with the changes in the energy market that Wallaroo could and likely will evolve and we’ve designed it in a way that we can actually do that.”
While a final decision is yet to be made on the storage capacity, the solar PV project is progressing with Flynn confirming the proposal had in recent weeks received the tick of approval from the federal Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (DAWE).
The project was referred to the department earlier this year due to the site being a known habitat of two endangered lizard species.
The department has however deemed the project can go ahead in its intended form.
“It was concluded that a significant impact on both of these threatened species was very unlikely,” the department said. “As such, the proposal is considered unlikely to affect the matters of national environmental significance.”
The Wallaroo Solar Farm will comprise an estimated 260,000 panels, an onsite substation and the battery storage system. The panels will be positioned on single axis tracking structures and the developers expect the facility will generate about 260,000 MWh of solar energy annually, providing power for up to 48,000 homes.
The project will connect to the National Electricity Market (NEM) via TransGrid’s existing 132 kV transmission line that traverses the 393-hectare site and connects to the nearby Canberra Substation.
“It’s a really strong part of the grid being so close to Canberra’s main substation and to the load centre,” Flynn said.
“We’re just working through completing all the appropriate studies now and making sure we tick all the boxes.
“We’re concurrently working on all the development approvals and the connection approvals, and we see those being completed around Q1 2022.”
Construction is expected to commence by July 2022 and will likely take 18 months to complete.

While the project will be in NSW, the site is less than one kilometre away from the Canberra suburbs of Dunlop and Macgregor and Flynn said the local community will be able to benefit directly with the developers teaming with Localvolts Electricity Exchange, a peer-to-peer platform for the buying and selling of energy, to provide nearby residents with access to renewable energy at a discounted rate.
“We are allocating some of the generation from Wallaroo Solar Farm and putting it through Localvolts,” he said.
“Localvolts will purchase of the power directly from the solar farm and provide the local community with energy that is much cheaper than what they’re currently paying now.”
The Wallaroo Solar Farm is part of a growing portfolio for New Energy Development with Flynn confirming the company is currently involved in the development of 12 large-scale solar farms with a combined generation capacity of 1.97 GW.
New Energy is a shareholder in the 1 GW Harlin Solar Farm being developed in Queensland, and is engaged as a consultant for the 100 MW Cunderdin Solar Farm project in Western Australia (WA).
The Cunderdin Solar Farm, being developed by Indian-Australian utility scale PV developer Sun Brilliance Power, has experienced significant delays since it was first mooted in 2017 but Flynn said construction is due to commence in January 2022.
The project has undergone significant growth since it was first proposed and now includes a 53.5 MW/214 MWh battery energy storage system, tipped to be the biggest largest in WA.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/10/how-zinc-bromide-innovators-gelion-found-a-way-to-cheaply-manufacturer-batteries-in-australia/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 10, 2021",How zinc-bromide innovators Gelion found a way to cheaply manufacturer batteries in Australia,"Against the odds, Sydney-based battery company Gelion Technologies believes it’s found a way to manufacture its zinc-bromide solar batteries here in Australia.
How? Well, put concisely, by completely overhauling its battery design. Gelion recently changed to a lead-acid format so it can leverage existing battery manufacturing capabilities and supply chains as the format’s traditional applications wane.
The first step on this new path, forged during the Covid-19 pandemic, is today’s announcement Gelion has formally entered into a partnership with one of Australia’s two lead-acid battery manufacturers, Battery Energy Power Solutions. The partnership will see Gelion’s redesigned and trademarked non-flow zinc-bromide (ZnBr2) ‘Endure’ batteries produced in Battery Energy’s facility in Fairfield, Sydney.
Gelion Technologies
Gelion’s rise and shift
University of Sydney chemistry professor,  Thomas Maschmeyer, founded Gelion in 2015 to commercialise a significant discovery made during his research, for which he won the Prime Minister’s Prize for Innovation in 2020. But while Gelion’s innovative gel solution and subsequent bipolar batteries have indeed enjoyed success in the past years, Professor Maschmeyer said as the company moved toward commercialisation, it became clear its original design would struggle to be viable.
“As an academic, you think the best way… [is the] intellectually most elegant way. But that may not be the best at all from an engineering point of view, or from a commerce, financial, manufacturing point of view. So bringing it out of the lab and into real world manufacturing was a hugely informative journey for us,” Professor Maschmeyer told pv magazine Australia.
In case the reader isn’t familiar with Gelion’s backstory and innovations, the breakthrough which launched Professor Maschmeyer into the battery creation space was his zinc-bromide battery gel. Traditionally, zinc-bromide chemistries have been implemented as flow batteries, which have operational and commercial challenges since they’re costly and complex to produce.
Professor Maschmeyer’s discovery moved Gelion away from flow arrangements, with the professor describing the gel as essentially a 3D flyscreen which holds liquid, permitting chemistry to happen inside it, and thereby allowing the transport of ions to be engineered.
Gelion Technologies
This makeup is quite novel, with only Gelion and U.S. company Eos playing in the non-flow zinc-bromide space – though there are a number of flow battery companies pursuing the chemistry, the most notable of which is Brisbane-based Redflow.
Professor Maschmeyer describes zinc-bromide chemistry as ideal for solar batteries as it’s relatively slow to charge. He’s glad other companies are playing in the space, positing lithium as the real competition – over which he says Gelion’s technology has significant advantages, particularly with regards to safety. Its electrolyte gel is a fire retardant, meaning its batteries can’t catch fire or explode. In fact, they can operate safely at temperatures up to 50°C and can be completely discharged to zero volts with no loss of function, making them “very abuse tolerant”.
Current designs of the individual Endure battery cells are between 200 to 300Wh currently. “This capacity is being fine-tuned as we finalise our production systems,” the company’s CEO Andrew Grimes said. “However, as the Gelion Endure battery is a scalable product, these individual cells are designed to work together to provide capacity ranging from the kilowatt-hour to megawatt-hour scale,” he added.
As it stands, its Endure battery has round-trip-efficiency of 90%, is non-toxic (bromide essentially being just a salty-solution) and the company claims it’s more than 95% recyclable.
These features were refined in Gelion’s initial bipolar format, but when the company began its deep design studies with a global parter (who it is yet to reveal) during the pandemic, it arrived at the conclusion the smartest way to commercialise the Endure battery would be to switch the design to a parallel plate lead-acid format.
Two things preceded this decision. The first was the complexity of building new manufacturing capability, and second was the fact access to capital for such an endeavour is effectively hamstrung in Australia due to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation’s rules.
“If you want to produce something in a factory here, you need to have a factory reference plant the same size or bigger that has been operating for two years and that allows you to have full emissions data of the factory. That means you can never build a new factory here for new technology because you’ve got to prove it somewhere and you can’t prove it here,” Professor Maschmeyer said.
Gelion Technologies
“If you can hook onto something that already exists, it’s much better,” he added, pointing out that lithium-ion factories largely came from the repurposing of CDs and DVDs factories when tape formats became obsolete. “That’s why it was possible to introduce it so quickly worldwide, because they didn’t have to build everything from scratch.”
“That’s exactly the concept behind us going for a lead-acid format.”
Taking Swedish battery developer Northvolt’s costings, the Gelion team discovered for them to retune an existing lead-acid battery factory for 1 GWh production capability would cost US$16 million (AU$21.7 million). To build a new lithium-ion factory with a 1 GWh capacity, on the other hand, would cost US$125 million (AU$170 million). A game-changing difference. 
Lead-acid batteries are today about a $45 billion dollar industry, Professor Maschmeyer estimates. They are ubiquitous around the world, but increasingly under pressure, given electric vehicles (EVs) are quickly replacing petrol and diesel cars globally, for which lead-acid batteries are used. While telecom towers and trains still employ the lead-acid format, Professor Maschmeyer believes this will shift over time, freeing up even more capacity in these manufacturing plants.
“The assets are still there, so we can go in and give them a second life – go from a low-growth to a high-growth business with sunken costs already taken care of,” he said.
“That overcomes one of the main reasons, if not the main reason, for new battery technologies failing – and that is that they’ve got to build their own factories.”
Gelion Technologies
Test manufacturing in these facilities though, Gelion soon realised lead-acid factories worked quite differently to how its battery was designed. “We learned from that we could do things differently and interact much more productively. Rather than having to retune 80% of their line, we could retune 20% of their line [by changing our battery design]. And that makes, of course, a huge difference in cost, in risk, in timing, lead times,” Professor Maschmeyer said.
“And as we now have effectively a lead-acid format, we are using similar kind of membranes, similar kinds of carbons, similar kinds of housing, valves, the whole thing, so supply chains are already there,” he added. “Being able to hook onto existing supply lines, and diverting a little bit of that towards us and then only having a few bespoke pieces reduces the risk a lot and reduces the cost a lot.”
At the moment, Gelion is sourcing its zinc and bromide and other battery materials through existing supply chains, but its aim in future is to source most of its minerals from Australia. “We’ve got ingredients here, they are being mined and processed. So why not do some processing here for battery grade materials?”
Gelion’s Endure zinc-bromide batteries will be deployed in production trials next year ahead of anticipated commercial availability.
Gelion Technologies
As you might have guessed, Gelion’s model going forward is not to manufacture its batteries in house, but rather to partner with facilities which have existing capabilities.
“We don’t intend ourself to become a battery manufacturing company. We are a tech developer to get it commercialisation, and we then license to partners,” Professor Maschmeyer said. “We are going overseas but we are also staying local with the same model.”
The company is targeting a commercial product cost of just $100 per kWh, which is highly competitive. Obviously, since cost is hugely dependent on volume, the company’s strategy is to tolerate a loss in its first few years while production scales up.
“We’ve factored that in, so what we will do is have a competitively priced product in the market and at very small scales it will be a lost leader, and as we establish marketshare, we will break even, and then as we get more marketshare, it goes cash flow positive,” Professor Maschmeyer said. He estimates the company should be able to break even and cover its costs by 2023 or 2024, if all goes according to plan.
Gelion is currently doing a capital raise, aiming to raise around $10 million. Given its last raise came in well oversubscribed at $13 million, the company is hopeful. After the raise concludes at the end of this month, the company will decide whether to stay private, or go public.
Gelion Technologies
Professor Maschmeyer and the Gelion team are buoyed by the fact Wood Mackenzie’s analysis has Australia representing 8% of the global energy storage investment market. Our island, he pointed out, rarely commands more than 1%, affording us an unusually strong position in the grid connected storage market, which Wood Mac says could be worth US$86 billion (AU$116 billion) globally by 2025.
Back to Gelion specifically, the company has two rollout horizons it plans to target successively. The first horizon is smaller projects, 10 kWh to 1 MWh, which includes stand alone systems, mining, irrigation, and pumping applications.
It then plans to move to 10 MWh+ installations. “Then once we have the capacity to produce a few hundred megawatt hours, we can go into supporting solar farms or wind farms etcetera,” which, Professor Maschmeyer said, is horizon two. It’s aiming to reach that vista towards the end of 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/10/australian-start-up-sets-25-54-efficiency-record-for-silicon-cell/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 10, 2021",Australian start-up sets 25.54% efficiency record for silicon cell,"Sydney-based solar technology start-up SunDrive has rocked the status quo, developing a silver-free solar PV cell and at the same time elevating the world efficiency record for a commercial-size silicon solar cell to 25.54%.
SunDrive announced on Thursday night it had received official word from Germany’s Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH) confirming it had set a world record for the efficiency at which its solar cells convert sunlight to electricity.
“SunDrive has officially set a new world record for a commercial size silicon solar cell,” the company posted on social media.
“A proud milestone for the team that worked incredibly hard to achieve this.”

The result is a major shake-up for the industry with China-based solar cell manufacturers topping the efficiency records in recent years. Manufacturing giant Longi Solar held the previous top mark for a commercial-size monocrystalline hetero-junction (HJT) solar cell, achieving 25.26% during testing at ISFH earlier this year.
While SunDrive celebrated the world record, the company’s technology – which replaces the expensive silver used in conventional solar cells with the cheaper and more abundant copper – could have greater ramifications, potentially lowering the manufacturing cost of solar PV panels.
Silver is a core component in today’s solar panels. It is estimated solar panel manufacturing accounts for about 20% of the world’s annual consumption of the precious metal, with the volume expected to rise steeply as the next generation of high-efficiency cells currently being developed require up to three times more silver than their antecedents.
SunDrive’s solution, developed by chief executive Vince Allen during his PhD at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, has been to replace the precious metal with copper.
Copper doesn’t have the same highly conductive properties as silver and does not adhere well to the surface of the solar cell but Allen, who along with former flatmate David Hu founded SunDrive in 2015, has found a solution. And a much more affordable one.

“The thing about copper is that it’s very abundant and usually about 100 times cheaper than silver,” Allen said.
Allen said finding more affordable and more abundant materials shapes as a stumbling block for the solar industry if it is to grow as predicted.
“We’re only at the very early stages of where the industry can be with only 3% of the world’s electricity currently coming from solar,” he said.
“If we want to get to 50, 60, 70% and beyond, we’re going to need a lot more solar cells and that’s a massive challenge.”
Allen has previously said SunDrive’s aim is to produce the cells locally, optimistic that they can compete with large solar manufacturers in Asia while protecting their intellectual property.
“The industry today is at a point where the land and labour costs are becoming less and less significant in the total cost of manufacturing … obviously it does mean that we need to at least match that similar level of automation and throughput, but we do see opportunity to do it in Australia,” he said.
Hu has said the company’s initial focus would be the rooftop sector, declaring it the ideal place for SunDrive’s technology to enter into the market because the limited space allows the most efficient solar cells to shine the brightest, producing more energy for every square foot.
The company has already attracted support from the industry, with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) providing $3 million in funding to help scale its manufacturing process.
Mike Cannon-Brookes, one of Australia’s wealthiest people, has backed the start-up through his Grok Ventures, venture capitalist funds Blackbird has also provided backing while former Suntech chief Shi Zhengrong was SunDrive’s first angel investor.

The investment plan, released on Thursday, comes after the federal government last month changed the agency’s functions to enable it to fund what it says are “next generation” energy technologies contained in the government’s Low Emissions Technology Statement (LETS).
The move met with widespread opposition before surviving a challenge in the Senate last month.
ARENA chief executive Darren Miller said despite the inclusion of new priorities, the agency will continue to focus on projects that optimise Australia’s energy transition to renewable generation, including energy storage projects and large-scale grid integration.
“We are at the beginning of a critical decade for Australia and the world as we make the investments required to reduce emissions in line with international commitments,” he said.
“We need to invest today in the technologies that are going to transform our energy system and our economy in the years to come.
“We need to utilise Australia’s abundant sun and wind resources to produce, use and supply renewable energy. We need to optimise this transition through energy storage, large-scale grid integration, flexible demand and further reducing the cost of solar and wind.”
While ARENA will continue to fund renewable energy projects, it will also prioritise projects that reduce emissions from the production of steel and aluminium, helping the emissions intensive metals sector to decarbonise and create low-emission materials. CCS projects, and soil carbon measurement technologies.
ARENA
Miller said the agency will also focus on CCS projects, soil carbon measurement technologies. accelerating the uptake of hydrogen, including that produced with natural gas where emissions are captured.
“We’ve already committed over $160 million in hydrogen, but we need to continue to grow a clean hydrogen industry and export market as this is still in its infancy,” he said.
“We also need to support the aluminium and steel industry to transition, whether through electrification, hydrogen or new alternatives in order to improve the competitiveness and emissions intensity of our heavy industries.
“Finally, we will be looking to scale up CCS and reduce the cost of soil carbon.”
Miller said ARENA would look to consult with industry and researchers to develop its approach to the new priorities.
ARENA will also deliver budget programs including the Future Fuels Fund, the Industrial Energy Transformation Studies Program, the Regional Australia Microgrid Pilots Program, the Freight Efficiency Assistance Grants and Freight Energy Productivity Trial Program.
Since being established in 2012 to finance renewable energy projects, ARENA has provided $1.77 billion in funding to more than 600 renewable energy projects with a total project value of $7.75 billion.
Last year, ARENA was renewed for a further decade with $1.62 billion in funding.

One example of this is the Ramahyuck District Aboriginal Corporation (RDAC), which has been providing healthcare and family support services for Aboriginal people in the Gippsland region since 1992, and yesterday won a $1 million grant for the construction of a 4.9 MW solar farm, and $26,000 to install solar arrays atop the Heyfield and District Museum, Coongulla Community Hall, Heyfield Golf Club and Heyfield Tennis Club.
This funding will result in the first solar farm wholly owned and operated by an Aboriginal Corporation, and the first on Aboriginal-owned land in Victoria.
Victorian Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change Lily D’Ambrosio announced the grant, along with four other community group recipients in the Gippsland area, through the Latrobe Valley Energy and Growth Program (Program). D’Ambrosio also announced the second phase of the Program which will see $1.98 million granted for new renewable energy projects in Latrobe City, Baw Baw Shire, and Wellington Shire.
“Helping industry and community groups achieve affordable reliable power now and into the future is more important than ever,” said D’Ambrosio, “this funding helps deliver that – creating jobs and stimulating the economy.”
The Ramahyuck Solar Farm (RSF) is set to be situated outside the city of Sale on 16ha of under-utilised land in the town of Longford. According to the RSF’s brief, the 4.9 MW grid-connected PV system will provide a 20 year plus income stream “to enable a healthy, strong and vibrant Aboriginal community”, an “opportunity for customers to achieve their Indigenous procurement and corporate social responsibility targets”, “Aboriginal employment and training opportunities in the fast-growing renewable energy sector”, and of course “reduce grid electricity greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 12,000 tonnes each year.
Jane Garret, Member for Eastern Victoria, said she was “delighted to see Ramahyuck District Aboriginal Corporation get support for the first solar farm on Aboriginal-owned land in Victoria – a project that means self-determination on renewable energy and jobs for the community.”
The Ramahyuck Solar Farm is another sign of what is hopefully a growing trend of indigenous representation in the ownership structures of renewable energy project. In July, plans for the ‘historic’ 50 GW Western Green Energy Hub were announced, ‘historic’ not simply for the project’s ambitiousness, but because of its partnership with First Nations Land Owners through Mirning Green Energy Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Mirning Traditional Lands Aboriginal Corporation, which will have a “meaningful carried equity stake” in the green hydrogen project and a permanent seat on the project consortium’s board.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/10/how-safe-are-smart-ev-chargers/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,EV,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"SEPTEMBER 10, 2021",How safe are smart EV chargers?,"From pv magazine USA
Smart chargers have become a useful resource for electric vehicle (EV) owners, allowing them to remotely monitor and manage the charge state, speed and timing of their car chargers, among other functions. Smart chargers can also be integrated into a home’s solar and storage system to provide even greater control and flexibility over one’s own energy use.
As with any emerging technology, there have been hiccups and issues in the early stages of rollout. However, with smart EV chargers, these shortcomings are more concerning than, say, a malfunctioning new video game console.
Pen Test Partners, a security consulting company, recently spent 18 months investigating the security of some of the market’s leading smart charger offerings, and found troubling results. Of the six smart chargers they tested, nearly all of them included some level of security risk, from accessible user data to the possibility of hijacking “millions” of smart chargers.
To better understand how these risks emerged, the scope of the issue at hand, and potential remedies for the risks, pv magazine spoke with Baksheesh Singh Ghuman, senior director of product and GTM strategy at Finite State, a cybersecurity company focused on Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices.
IoT refers to the network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies that are used for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet, like smart chargers, smart thermostats and smartphones.
“It’s a connected device, so its functions are all software defined. The software controls a majority of the functions,” explained Ghuman. “[They can define] who the users are, who can charge and cannot charge, when they can charge, or how much they can charge.”
Ghuman said that while the devices are connected, they also allow remote access. Functionally, this allows owners to access the charger’s app from a distance, so they can look at state of charge on their vehicles. That means that the devices are also connected to a user’s home network. If one gets access to a smart charger, that means they can indirectly get access to a user’s home network.
The user is then compromised and potentially open to cyberattacks, as well as ransomware attacks, which shut down devices until a ransom is paid.
According to Ghuman, the associated vulnerabilities can be placed in three critical categories:
The specific consequences of these vulnerabilities differ between public-use EV chargers and private chargers in a user’s home. For public chargers, the main concern is theft of electricity.
“If somebody’s got access to it, then they can then we can use the same account to charge multiple devices or vehicles,” said Ghuman.
Individuals could also remotely turn on and off as many chargers as they have access to, whenever they want, for however long they want, which could have an indirect impact on the power grid.
“It’s like a cyberattack, so to speak. There’s a whole range of things you can do you can ever have more access to that. You can actually control the device itself,” he said.
For homes, the risk is more on network control and user data extraction. Individuals could also send bad information to billing systems, charging users for more electricity than they consume, and gain access to all user data stored within a device and its associated software and apps.
“If you’ve got access to a device, you can actually control the device and, from that device, then, if it’s connected to the internet, you essentially have an impact on other devices within the home,” said Ghuman.
Despite the grim potential of cyberattacks, Ghuman said that the situation is by no means a lost cause, and that remedies would not require significant labor or overhaul – at least, not yet.
“There is already work underway, and these vulnerabilities only serve to highlight that there is a strong need for for security,” said Ghuman. “I think the device manufacturers are working very hard to make sure that the products are secure. But as you know, cybersecurity or security in general is so complex. Sometimes you don’t know from where a vulnerability or a threat factor is going to come from.”
He outlined that most of the known concerns could be patched with firmware. Ghuman said the charger installer must then ensure that the firmware is secure, has been tested before deployment, and is updated or patched post-deployment, in case any additional vulnerabilities are discovered.
This was a conclusion that Pen Test Partners also reached. After its study, the company said it contacted the manufacturers with its findings, and a number of them resolved the issues within 24 hours.
“I think that more and more companies are realising the key to a competitive advantage is product security,” said Ghuman. “So the more secure your product is, the more competitive advantage you have, because nobody wants to do recalls. And so and nobody wants a reputational loss.”
