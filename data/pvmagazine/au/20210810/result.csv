The big battery project, the largest proposed for the state by a long shot, has been fast tracked by the Victorian government under its planning scheme amendment, a pathway for significant state projects. The company hopes to reach financial close by the second quarter of 2022, with production to begin by the second half of 2023 to support the network over that summer.
“We see this as a longterm piece of energy infrastructure that will play a range of different roles as the decade rolls through to a range of different customers,” Syncline Energy’s CEO, Phil Galloway, told pv magazine Australia.
The Australian company will own and operate the project, which will also include a 12.5 MWp solar farm to supply the battery’s ancillary cooling loads and ensure low cost, ‘net-zero’ operations.
The project’s site is more than 90 hectares, which Galloway says can deliver safe battery cube spacing and buffer areas that would not normally be possible on the urban fringe of a major city. He secured the enviable site after his team spent a year driving between Victoria’s various substations and speaking to councils, gathering together a list of 20 potential locations. “This was by far number one,” he said.
One of the reasons for that is the site lays at the junction between three of Victoria’s emerging Renewable Energy Zones, allowing the Melton Renewable Energy Hub to connect to each of those separate zones via the state’s 500kV transmission “backbone.”

The chemistry of the proposed big battery is yet to be finalised, though it will be of the lithium variety.
Galloway said Syncline is also looking to use ‘second life’ batteries from cars and busses in its energy storage array. When Syncline’s battery cells reach the end of their lives, Galloway plans to build systems for recovering the lithium, nickel and cobalt on site. Key to that is using a narrow range of chemistries to optimise the recovery process, Galloway noted.
This, he says, is part of a “product stewardship approach” the company plans to take.
“We need to be responsible for that whole cycle,” he said, adding that he would like to see the storage industry become more mature about the OHS (occupational health and safety) around its operations.
The project intends to integrate grid-forming technologies, though Galloway said he is still waiting for clarity around the national electricity rules for grid-forming services, which are still being formed. This has been earmarked as a top priority for network operators, with regulation expected to become clearer in the coming year.
Likening it to the model of data centres, Galloway said “storage as service” will form the core of the project’s business model. That is, he is looking at leasing battery space with the project.
AEMO has registered the Melton Renewable Energy Hub as an intending market participant, with the project already completing the preliminary connection enquiry stages. Its connection application process is underway with the grid capacity studies complete.
Syncline Energy is behind Victoria’s  110 MW Bannerton Solar Farm, as well as two commercial geothermal projects at Warrnambool, and has developed hybrid microgrids in the Northern Territory and Western Australia.

Speaking at the NSW Energy Summit, hosted virtually by the Smart Energy Council, Stock said powering the state’s bus fleet, the largest in Australia, with green hydrogen will help it hit its 2030 targets on the way to net-zero by 2050.
Stock also announced the state will be launching a NSW hydrogen collaboration platform in the coming days. The digital platform is intended to facilitate connections between hydrogen projects and consumers. He noted developers wanting to be included on the platform should get in touch with the department directly.
NSW is the last state to release a hydrogen strategy but Stock said it will be a “strong strategy” and can be expected towards the end of the year.
The state is putting a particular focus on developing hydrogen hubs in the Hunter region near Newcastle and the Illawarra at Port Kembla, for which $70 million in funding has been committed.
NSW will spent from the second quarter of 2022 to the third quarter of the same year assessing hydrogen projects for government funding. It has flagged mid-2024 as the “latest hydrogen production” date.

The state government is eager to unlock hydrogen for the heavy transport space, Stock said – which is where transitioning its public transport fleet will prove helpful.
Jemena & Coregas collaborate on green hydrogen boost for NSW transport industry
Just yesterday, gas utility Jemena announced it will begin producing and supplying green hydrogen from its Western Sydney plant for use by transport and industrial customers from early 2022 in partnership with Coregas. It’s targeting buses and trucks as its primary offtake markets.
“We know that green hydrogen has the immediate potential to become a viable zero emission alternative to many petroleum-based fossil fuels currently used by industries such as transport and remote power generation,” Jemena’s General Manager for Renewable Gas, Gabrielle Sycamore, said. “Hydrogen fuel cells are particularly well suited to long distance heavy haulage trucking requirements based on their comparatively light weight and fast refuelling times which can be just a matter of minutes.” 
The green hydrogen will be produced at Jemena’s $15 million Western Sydney Green Gas Project. Co-funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), the Power-to-Gas project is converting renewable electricity to hydrogen gas which can be blended and stored in Jemena’s gas distribution network to supply New South Wales homes and businesses.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/10/worlds-largest-grid-forming-battery-to-begin-construction-near-adelaide/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INVERTERS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"AUGUST 10, 2021",World’s largest ‘grid forming’ battery to begin construction near Adelaide,"The Torrens Island battery marks AGL’s first grid-scale storage project and will be built at the company’s gas plant, where it will continue to provide electricity as the fossil-fuel run turbines retire.
While the $180 million battery isn’t Australia largest and only has one hour of storage (it is expected to expand to four hours), the project will be the largest in the world with grid-forming capacity, and will undoubtedly be keenly observed within Australia and internationally.
The system, to be delivered by Wärtsilä, will operate initially in the usual grid-following mode, meaning the output synchronises to the grid’s voltage waveform. It will then be switched into the more novel grid-forming mode, making it capable of providing the grid with ‘virtual inertia.’

System strength services and inertia has traditionally been the realm of spinning mass fossil-fuel driven turbines but grid-forming projects hold promise as a clean substitute.
Their virtual inertia is provided by grid-forming inverters, which in this project will be provided by Germany company SMA. Also known as virtual synchronous generation, grid forming technology was flagged by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) just last week as a top priority because of the crucial role it expects the technology will play for the clean energy transition, which will see the country move from baseload generation, like coal plants, to variable renewable sources like solar, wind and batteries which rely on inverter-based technologies.
While large-scale demonstrations of grid-forming storage like Torrens Island are not yet in operation, Australia has already had some successes with the technology on a smaller scale – namely at the 30 MW/8 MWh Dalrymple Battery Energy Storage System, which is currently the only source of virtual inertia on the National Electricity Market. Storage systems with grid-forming inverters independently set their internal frequency and speed, making them able to form an islanded grid by generating a frequency reference. In other words, they can continue providing power to the network if the main grid goes down – something systems without that technology cannot do.

The news of the grid-forming plans for Torren Island comes hot off the heals of South Australia transmission provider ElectraNet deploying two synchronous condensers in the state, with another two in the woodwork. The primary role of these spinning machines is also to provide system strength and inertia, an example of old tech being redeployed for the new world. In comparison to grid-forming inverters, though, the solution appears far less flexible and unable to offer multiple services. 
SMA said it will supply 109 Medium Voltage Power Stations (MVPS-SCS4200) to Wärtsilä for Torrens Island project. According to the company, its “MVPS-SCS4200” is a turnkey solution for large storage systems. With the new, robust battery central inverters Sunny Central Storage UP and coordinated medium-voltage components, the turnkey solution offers more power density, it added. The complex system is also supported by the GEMS Power Plant Controller and the energy management software from Wärtsilä.
“The Torrens Island project has huge implications globally; Australia is among the leading countries in the world when it comes to high levels of renewable energy feeding into the grid at particular times of the day,” Joshua Birmingham, Director of Large-Scale & Project Solutions at SMA Australia said.
AGL, Australia’s biggest emitter, has committed to build 850 MW of battery-based assets by 2024 – a significant shift which will turn the colossal ship of AGL toward a new destination in the clean energy transition. 
To that end, Torrens Island marks the first of those to be constructed at the site of a fossil-fuel power plant. It won’t be the last though, with big batteries planned for New South Wale’s Liddell and the Victoria’s Loy Yang coal plants.
In January, the company announced it had secured both Wärtsilä and Fluence under non-exclusive framework agreements to supply up to 1 GW of large-scale battery storage.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/10/zinc-iron-redox-flow-battery-with-zero-dendrite-growth/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 10, 2021",Zinc-iron redox flow battery with zero dendrite growth,"From pv magazine Global
Redox flow batteries present an attractive alternative to lithium-ion in the stationary storage segment, thanks to potentially longer lifetimes and capability for daily 100% discharge without loss of performance.
Many commercial projects featuring different types of flow batteries are already underway for both large-scale and residential energy storage. However, questions are being raised about the materials used in some of the batteries, with the toxicity of vanadium used in most of the large-scale projects a particular sticking point.
Zinc-based flow batteries present a less toxic option, and a zinc-bromine chemistry has already seen some commercial development. Zinc-iron (Zn-Fe) is another option widely explored by researchers, with the abundance of iron making it a particularly attractive option. However, dendrite growth and the related performance loss and short-circuiting, have held this chemistry back so far.
Scientists led by the University of Calicut in India fabricated a zinc-iron redox flow battery that demonstrated discharge voltage of approximately 1.34 V at 25 mA cm−2, with a coulombic efficiency (CE) of 92%, voltage efficiency (VE) of 85% and energy efficiency (EE) of ~78% for 30 charge-discharge cycles. Most importantly, the battery showed no performance degradation over those initial 30 cycles, and zero dendrite growth. The battery is described in full in the paper A dendrite free Zn-Fe hybrid redox flow battery for renewable energy storage, published in Energy Storage.
Though it would have to retain these characteristics for a lot more than 30 cycles, the results are encouraging. The group credits the suppression of dendrites to its use of an anion-exchange membrane (AEM) that it designed and fabricated using guanidine carbonate, formaldehyde, melamine and polymer binding agent.
They note that when this was replaced with a porous PVC membrane as a control experiment dendrite formation could be observed even on the battery’s first charge. “Absence of dendrite growth might be due to the fact that, only the chloride ions shuttles between two electrolyte solutions through AEM and this probably promotes uniform zinc deposition and prevents the dendrite growth,” the group states.
They expect to follow up with further details on the fabrication of the AEM and its role in the battery’s performance, and the group remains convinced that its approach can prove useful for the stationary storage of renewable energy, among other applications. “We have successfully demonstrated working of a high efficiency and stable Zn-Fe hybrid redox flow battery with no dendrite growth during zinc deposition by optimising charge-discharge conditions and employing an anion exchange membrane as separator,” their paper concludes.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/10/ipcc-report-issues-blunt-2030-climate-warning/,"RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",BLAKE MATICH,"AUGUST 10, 2021",IPCC report issues blunt 2030 climate warning,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has delivered the conclusions of its most comprehensive climate report yet, and the news is as stark as it is sobering. 
According to the Sixth Assessment Report, global warming is likely to increase to 1.5C by as early as 2030, a projected increase on our current trajectory that will see more erratic and unprecedented climatic effects upon sea levels, wildfires and droughts. United Nations (UN) secretary-general Antonio Guterres described the report as a “code red for humanity”. 
According to the ABC, Guterres went on to say that the report “must sound the death knell for coal and fossil fuels, before they destroy our planet.” 
For Australia in particular, the report is unflinching, with warming having already reached 1.4C. Australian National University Professor Mark Howden, Director of the ANU Institute for Climate, Energy and Disaster Solutions and also a Vice-Chair of the IPCC and a contributing author to the report, said the global temperature increases could climb as high as 5.7C this century. 
“The more we know about climate change, the more we should be concerned,” said Howden. “This report is another clear and loud alarm bell. It makes clear the impacts of climate change are accumulating almost every day; we’re already seeing worsening temperature extremes such as marine heatwaves that cause coral bleaching and heatwaves on land with dangerous consequences for human health.” 
“Reducing emissions from the 2020s onwards and reaching net zero before the 2050s is really our best chance at keeping temperature increases below 1.5C,” continued Howden. And the Pacific region could be one of the worst hit.

“Fortunately,” said Howden “there are many emerging opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This includes transitioning to 100% renewable energy as rapidly as possible, decarbonising transport, reducing emissions from agriculture, and drawing down and storing atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions.” 
The Clean Energy Council (CEC) says that we have the renewable energy resources today to push for rapid decarbonisation. CEC chief executive Kane Thornton says the IPCC report “could not be more explicit about the urgency required to cut carbon emissions, and the clean energy industry is ready to continue doing the heavy lifting.” 
“Australia has tremendous potential to produce low-cost electricity from renewables which can power the country and the world,” continued Thornton, “and we must lean into the clean energy transition, not seek to hold back the tide. When the upside of taking action is so good for jobs, the economy and the environment, why would we delay?” 
“Australia is in an enviable position to be able to harness the power of clean energy resources,” concluded Thornton, “providing a pathway to turning our reputation as a climate laggard around.”

The Indian Railways has tendered the hybrid hydrogen fuel cell and battery-based technology to run trains as part of its efforts to cut emissions as well as fuel costs. Initially, it plans hydrogen power-based conversion of two diesel-electric multiple unit (DEMU) rakes in the 89km Sonipat-Jind section of Northern Railway. 
The hydrogen fuel cell retrofitment kit, along with the balance-of-plant and energy storage and hydrogen storage modules, will replace the existing power-train items onboard 1,600HP DEMUs.
Based on operational requirements of a 1,600 HP DEMU, the power train should consist of a primary energy source of 800 kW PEMFC hydrogen fuel cell-based power stacks (preferably in multiples of 100/150/200 kW) supported by a secondary energy source (battery bank) with a power rating of 400 kW. The battery bank must be based on Lithium-ion technology. However, other battery types may also be accepted, provided these offer better energy and power density, life cycle, etc.
The scope of work includes design, supply, retrofitment, testing, field trials of fuel cell and battery-based power stack modules, hydrogen storage, power electronics/controls and associated equipment, including necessary engineering & supervision work, for hydrogen uses for retrofitment of 1600HP DEMUs.
