To cope, Australia’s energy market operator is proposing over 10,000 kilometres of new transmission lines, linking major renewable precincts with the cities.
The problem? No one likes having large, unsightly lines built near them. There’s already been strong pushback from communities near sites slated for new power lines. Community resistance has now forced the federal government to launch a review of how transmission projects are approved.
The good news is, some alternatives to large-scale transmission lines have come of age. Grid-scale battery banks have already proven their use to store intermittent flows of green electricity for later. And we may be able to build more lightly if we adopt dynamic line rating, which means letting more power flow through when, say, cold winds cool the lines and stop them overheating. Western Australia – which has its own grid – is having success with microgrids as a way to avoid having to send power long distances.

Coal power was concentrated in coal-rich areas such as the LaTrobe Valley in Victoria and the Hunter Valley in New South Wales.
But the best renewable resources are often located in different places. That means a green grid has to connect new renewable zones such as Victoria’s Murray River zone and New South Wales’ Illawarra zone. (Some coal areas, like the LaTrobe Valley, will be able to take advantage of resources such as offshore wind and pair this with existing transmission infrastructure).
We will have to build some new transmission infrastructure. That’s unavoidable. But we can do this cleverly and minimise the impact on communities and landowners.
How? Battery banks allow us to store energy for later use. So if new transmission lines are built leaner and smaller, we could use these grid batteries to store excess energy and transmit it later.
Dynamic line rating offers another way to reduce the scale of new transmission lines.
Every transmission line is rated to a certain power capacity. A key factor limiting how much electricity can flow through a given line is heat. As electrons move, they produce heat. Too high a current and the line will overload.
But if, say, the wind is blowing strongly, it can cool the power lines and let them carry more capacity. That’s especially useful in a grid with a lot of wind energy flowing in. When the weather conditions are right, it could mean carrying as much as 20% more current.
At present, large-scale lithium batteries are the most technically viable way to store electricity relatively cheaply. These are already up and running. South Australia’s Hornsdale battery was one of the first, but other states are now joining in. Victoria recently installed a new big battery on the site of a former coal power station.
To date, these batteries have mainly been used to firm up output and boost system reliability.
But they can do more. We can use them as virtual power lines, storing excess power close to a renewable zone and transmitting it to another storage system close to cities and towns as the peak load arrives.
The virtual power line concept has been adopted in Germany and Chile to relieve transmission systems at risk of congestion when bursts of renewable power arrive.
We can even use them as virtual reservoirs, storing energy from hydro plants for later transmission.

It’s in everyone’s interests to minimise how many new transmission lines we build. For the government, being able to reduce the size of the build means savings – and less demand on our already stretched workforce. And for local communities, it means some – but not all – new lines could be avoided.
How do we make it a reality? Essentially, by embedding these new approaches into the way we plan for the electricity grid of the future. When considering any new transmission lines, planners should assess whether part of the needed transmission capacity could instead be provided by virtual powerlines in the form of batteries, and whether the area is suitable for dynamic line rating schemes.
If we integrate these methods of making the most out of our grid’s capacity, we could keep the number of new lines to the minimum while ensuring we can take clean power from where it’s produced to where it’s needed.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/12/solar-and-storage-solution-to-power-blyth-big-battery-project/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MICROGRID,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 12, 2023",Solar and storage solution to power Blyth big battery project,"Commodore Australia has designed and delivered a commercial off-grid power system comprising a 42 kW solar array coupled with 75 kWh of battery energy storage capacity that the Victorian company said will provide a reliable and sustainable source of power for the Blyth Battery construction site.
French clean energy developer Neoen commenced construction of its grid-scale Blyth Battery project earlier this year with Green Light Contractors, a subsidiary of the Australian arm of Spanish infrastructure development group Elecnor, appointed as balance-of-plant contractor.
Commodore, headquartered at Shepparton in northern Victoria, said Green Light had since sought it out to design and install a solar and storage system that delivers a clean, reliable energy supply while displacing diesel consumption.
The hybrid system comprises a 42 kW ground-mounted solar array with three-phase 30 kVA worth of inverters coupled with a 75 kWh battery energy storage system. The system also includes a 56 kVA back-up generator.
The off-grid solar solution, which is scheduled to commence operations within a “matter of weeks”, will be capable of meeting the site’s power requirements during the day while the battery storage energy system will provide back-up power at night and during inclement weather.

Commodore Sales and Marketing Manager Matt Miller said the installation of the system is part of a growing trend for off-grid renewable energy solutions in the construction industry.
“The commercial market for our containerised solutions and Power Skids has come in leaps and bounds in the past three years in particular,” he said. “While interest has been shown previously across mining and other industries in Australia, high diesel prices, CSR (corporate social responsibility) considerations and genuinely great expected return on investments has made off-grid solar a smart option to power most remote sites.”
Miller said he expects the trend will accelerate once more solutions enter job sites, mines and other use cases.
“The return on investment (ROI) of utilising solar and low voltage battery storage/off-grid systems compared to diesel generators is fantastic,” he said. “The general ROI versus running a diesel generator fulltime to run the site is between 4-5 years once you account for regular 250-hour generator service intervals, the cost of diesel and other relevant costs.”
“Not to mention, far less downtime since off-grid systems require far less maintenance than a diesel generator and environmental factors driving corporate social responsibility.”
Miller said the portable nature of the company’s systems also makes them ideal for construction and mining industries, as they can be easily moved from site to site.

The system installed at the Blyth site includes a ground-mounted PV array but many of Commodore’s renewable energy solutions feature the company’s unique layered solar system that allows it to maximise the generation capacity of a shipping container rooftop.
The patented design features up to three “layers” of solar that can slide on top of each other, expand out and lift to about 30 degrees.
The system, which ranges from 5.95 kW per 20ft container to 11.9 kW per 40ft container, is all hydraulic and automated and has been programmed to pack itself up if wind speeds get too high.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/12/rio-tinto-teams-with-sumitomo-to-build-hydrogen-plant/,"HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,JAPAN,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 12, 2023",Rio Tinto teams with Sumitomo to build hydrogen plant,"Japan’s Sumitomo Corporation will build a 2.5 MW renewable hydrogen pilot plant at Gladstone as part of Rio Tinto’s plan to trial the use of hydrogen as a replacement for gas in the calcination process as it seeks to minimise carbon emissions at its Yarwun alumina refinery.
Rio Tinto said the Yarwun Hydrogen Calcination Pilot Demonstration Program will be the first-of-its-kind deployment of hydrogen calcination technology in the world.
The project will consist of a 2.5 MW onsite electrolyser, a hydrogen storage facility and the retrofit of a hydrogen-capable burner to one of the refinery’s four calciners, which are the large industrial ovens used in alumina refining.
The project will be co-funded through a $32.1 million grant from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).
Sumitomo will own and operate the 2.5 MW electrolyser and supply the hydrogen to Rio Tinto. No details about the power source for the plant were provided but Sumitomo said the electrolyser will have a production capacity of more than 250 tonnes of renewable hydrogen annually.
The company said it has already completed its front end engineering and design study (FEED) and construction will start in 2024. The hydrogen plant is expected to be commissioned in 2025.
Rio Tinto Aluminium Pacific Operations Managing Director Armando Torres said if successful, the project will demonstrate the viability of using renewable hydrogen in the calcination process and could pave the way for adoption at scale across the industry worldwide.
“This pilot plant is an important step in testing whether hydrogen can replace natural gas in Queensland alumina refineries,” he said.
ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said the project could be a “game changer” for decarbonising one of Australia’s most emissions-intensive industries.
Alumina refining accounts for about 3% of Australia’s emissions and is an energy-intensive process, consuming more than twice the energy used by Tasmania.
“If this pilot project is successful, it could be a game changer for Australian alumina production, paving the way for deployment across the industry, and underscoring the importance of low-cost green hydrogen to decarbonise our largest industrial emitters,” Miller said.

The Western Green Energy Hub (WGEH), a joint venture proposal of Hong Kong-based developer InterContinental Energy, Europe-headquartered CWP Global, and WA’s Mirning Green Energy, is slated for 15,000 square kilometres in the Goldfields-Esperance region near the South Australian border.
The proposed mega-project would include 50 GW of wind and solar energy to power electrolysers to produce green hydrogen which will be provided domestically and exported internationally as the green fuels market continues to expand.
The consortium is currently assessing wind and solar resources at the selected site with final investment decision on the project scheduled for 2027. However, the full project could take 20 years to build.
WGEH Chief Executive Officer Ray Macdonald said the MoU is a key step forward in the process of having the major project completed.
“Projects like WGEH are large and complex and bringing in KEPCO, a proven partner and developer of large-scale infrastructure projects, is invaluable,” he said. “I look forward to the collaboration in our joint goal to develop the WGEH project, as well as being a long-term supply partner to South Korea and other international markets.”
Macdonald said the new partnership “is recognition of the work done to date and, perhaps more importantly, it recognises the opportunities that lie ahead.”

InterContinental Energy said that “once at full scale, the WGEH project has the potential to produce up to 3.5 million tonnes of zero-carbon green hydrogen per year, for supply to both domestic and international customers, including South Korea.”
KEPCO Vice President Chanhyuk Chun said the WGEH project feeds into the utility’s ambition to add large-scale clean hydrogen and ammonia projects that could export large volumes to South Korea for power generation to its business portfolio.
“We are very excited by what we see with the WGEH project, which is ideally located in an area of impressive wind and solar resource, enabling very large-scale green power generation and sizeable potential green hydrogen and ammonia offtake opportunities,” he said.
KEPCO, which is majority owned by the South Korean government, expects it will rely increasingly on green ammonia produced by green hydrogen for power generation purposes and has estimated it could use 5-10 million tonnes per year by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/12/flow-battery-capacity-and-longevity-boosted-by-unexpected-ingredient/,"ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 12, 2023",Flow battery capacity and longevity boosted by unexpected ingredient,"Flow batteries are two-chambered devices holding liquid electrolyte that are being actively developed across the world for their promise as grid-scale energy storage devices for an increasingly renewable energy-defined energy system.
Researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in the United States have developed a new electrolyte additive that may prove to be a breakthrough for flow batteries, boosting both capacity and longevity. Using a simple sugar that is used in food additives and pharmacological applications, the PNNL researchers were able to achieve a 60% boost in peak power in a research flow battery.
The additive, called β-cyclodextrin, is able to speed the electrochemical reaction that stores and releases the flow battery’s energy. The sugar is able to catalyse the reaction as a dissolved solution, rather than a solid applied to a surface, which is a first for flow batteries, according to the results published in Joule.
In the test battery, the sugar additive accepts positively charged protons, which helps balance out the movement of negative electrons as the battery discharges.

“This is a brand new approach to developing flow battery electrolyte,” said Wei Wang, PNNL battery researcher. “We showed that you can use a totally different type of catalyst designed to accelerate the energy conversion. And further, because it is dissolved in the liquid electrolyte it eliminates the possibility of a solid dislodging and fouling the system.”
The results are part of an effort to lower the amount of rare-earth minerals and toxic materials in battery energy storage. The researchers are hopeful the results are a step toward a more sustainable approach where chemicals can be synthesized in large amounts like in the pharmaceutical and food industries, rather than through heavy minerals mining.
In further research, the team is experimenting with other compounds that are similar to β-cyclodextrin, but smaller. Like adding honey to tea, the simple sugar makes the liquid thicker, which poses some complications for a flow-based system. However, the researchers found its catalytic benefits outweighed its viscosity drawbacks.
This research is part of a larger PNNL program to develop and test grid-scale energy storage technologies. The university is slated to open a Grid Storage Launchpad in 2024.
