To recap, the ESB – which includes the heads of the Australian Energy Market Commission, Australian Energy Regulator and Australian Energy Market Operator – is proposing to introduce a capacity market to Australia, in which generators would be paid to have their capacity available during certain periods. “This puts a value on generators being available during periods where demand could exceed supply,” the ESB’s proposal report said. 
The ESB says such markets are commonplace overseas, and it has modelled its proposal on a mechanism from the UK. 
The idea has been sharply criticised since its inception because of fears it will prolong the life of coal and gas assets, providing increasingly the uneconomic (not to mention polluting) plants with an income stream into the future. Critics believe the inclusion of thermal generation will also slow the inevitable move towards batteries and other kinds of storage technologies, ultimately hindering the path to net zero.
There has been a push to disbar coal and gas generators participating in such a market, but as was made apparent today, the ESB is refusing to cave to these calls.
It did, however, recommend giving states the opportunity to choose which form of generation to include in their regions, allowing them to exclude coal or gas – something Victoria has already expressed it may do.
The new federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, today welcomed that recommendation, saying such decisions should be left to states since their landscapes and assets vary considerably. 
The ESB also conceded that “new and existing capacity have different requirements. Existing capacity faces sunk costs, while new investors require sufficient certainty that their capital costs, as well as their operating costs, will be recovered.” In other words, it acknowledged new technologies would require greater financial support. 
The mechanism, the ESB said, is ultimately about creating greater certainty around coal plant closures and their replacements. “In a market where demand has been relatively stable for several years, it is difficult to make a case for new investment until a clear gap in the market has been established. A ‘wait and see’ approach from investors is a rational response to such uncertainty. But widespread ‘waiting and seeing’ will risk too little capacity being available and new capacity arriving too late,” the report reads.
“Designed well, the capacity mechanism will enable a swifter, less risky and more orderly transition to a net zero emissions energy system,” it added.
The mechanism would apply in all of the National Electricity Market jurisdictions, including New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia.
Under the proposal, AEMO would hold capacity auctions twice yearly, award contracts, and make payments to capacity providers. It would then need to allocate these costs to consumers – either through networks or retailers.
The ESB says the mechanism would need to be operational by July 2025, “to keep pace with the speed of the transition.” It is a timeline that seems quite ambitious given the historically slow pace of market reforms in Australia – not to mention this is one of the most hotly contested changes in the market to date.
The ESB said it will continue working with stakeholders on developing the final design. This detailed draft design is due by the end of the year with a final recommendation slated to go to ministers early in 2023.

The delays are currently by about a week, and includes projects in all generation types from renewable wind and solar to fossil generation like gas projects.
It is adamant though that commissioning activities have not, in fact, been suspended and it is continuing to progress over 500 MW of projects.
AEMO/CEDA
A spokesperson for AEMO clarified the situation to pv magazine Australia this morning, saying it is facing unprecedented operational challenges to maintain a reliable and secure electricity supply, including the need to manually dispatch large volumes of generation in the past week.
This situation, which is playing out in the National Electricity Market operating in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania, was described as “unprecedented” by the operator, which last week suspended the spot market in a drastic measure to bring the crisis under control.
“While we have continued to progress commissioning activities for more than 500 megawatts of plant over the last week, we have adjusted schedules for some plant[s],” an AEMO spokesperson told pv magazine Australia.
“We expect these adjustments to be in the order of a week and will keep relevant parties informed.”

The deal, Snowy’s second with CWP, expands the company’s renewable energy access but comes just weeks after it was revealed the company’s flagship project, the multibillion dollar Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project, may be delayed. 
Snowy 2.0 was supposed to come online by 2026, but that date may be pushed back to 2028.

Back to its deal with CWP, the contract will see Snowy purchase both power and renewables certificates from the 414 MW Uungula Wind Farm being built near Dubbo in central New South Wales.
The wind farm, CWP’s biggest to date, has received development approval and construction is planned to start this year. The power purchasing agreement (PPA) is slated to come into effect in 2026 when the wind farm becomes operational.
CWP currently operates and owns 650MW of renewable energy assets in the National Electricity Market (NEM) and has another 5GW of wind, storage and firming projects in its near-medium term development portfolio, it said.
This is the 12th such deal for Snowy, bringing its renewable purchases to 4.1 terawatt hours each year, Snowy’s Managing Director and CEO Paul Broad said. The company already has a PPA in place with CWP for its Bango Wind Farm, north of Yass in NSW.
While its renewable portfolio may be expanding, the company has lost much of its green cred with its plan for the 660 MW Kurri Kurri gas plant earmarked for the NSW Hunter region. 
Calling it rather more innocuously the ‘Hunter Power Project,’ it was granted $600 million in funding from former energy minister Angus Taylor. Before being elected, Labor told the Guardian it would also support the project, but only if it runs on green hydrogen by 2030.
It is a plan, Bruce Mountain, director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, says make ‘no sense.’ Since Labor’s election, the party has been quiet on the project.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/20/realising-electric-vehicle-to-grid-services/,"EV,OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY",,"JUNE 20, 2022",Realising electric vehicle-to-grid services,"Please explain how vehicle-to-grid works?
Vehicle to grid is the idea of tapping into all these electric vehicle (EV) batteries in people’s garages all around Australia to use as a ‘backup energy’ source. We will potentially have this really big distributed energy resource that is really useful and that we could draw on when we need it. In return for allowing their EV batteries to be accessed, vehicle owners would receive earnings or savings of some kind.
Why do we need vehicle-to-grid capability?  
Our energy grid needs more flexibility because we’re changing from centralised coal generators to energy being provided by lots of different sources – solar, wind etc.. The grid needs ways to adapt and manage change due to the flux in demand and flux in the energy being produced by these renewable energy sources. Batteries in vehicles would be useful for managing some demands from the grid. 
Most of the time, cars are parked not doing anything, particularly overnight when they are charging. Using a special charger, when the grid needs extra power (or less power), we can call on those cars to do that for a short time. 
ANU
How would the energy be taken and given back to the car owners?
An intermediary third party would use a centralised digital communication platform that will connect with the chargers that would then pull the energy from, or add energy to, those car batteries. Virtual power plants are already using this centralised digital communication technology together with home battery systems to control their energy outputs. 
Because EVs don’t need the entire night in order to charge up, the intermediary could shift the time that charging happens without making any noticeable difference to the vehicle owner. 
There would only be a little bit taken from each car battery, but the cumulative energy collected from these cars would offer a good additional supply. The car owner would then, for example, receive a credit on their energy bill for the power that was taken.  
As we move to a grid powered by renewable energy, demand response is a low cost way of helping manage the grid; consumers are already being encouraged to do things at different times to help the grid stay up. 
What is the potential scale of the energy that we could draw on?
The opportunities for this are tremendous. The battery capacity of 19 million vehicles would likely exceed 1,800 gigawatt hours. That’s equivalent to more than 10,000 “Tesla big batteries”, such as those used to help power South Australia, or five of the new Snowy 2.0 hydro-electric projects.
Why do we need to do this? 
To understand the importance of this work, we need to imagine electrifying all of Australia’s 19 million vehicles.
If all Australia’s vehicles were electric they would use more than 60 terawatt hours of electricity a year. That’s around 35% of Australia’s annual electricity consumption.
Still more imposing is the amount of power these vehicles could draw if they all charged at once.

Let’s say, for argument’s sake, there were 1 million, 7.7 kilowatt home chargers in Australia. That’s roughly one in ten properties. If all these cars charged at once, they would add 25% to the national load.
Adding public “fast chargers” and “ultra fast chargers”, say along highways and in car parks, would increase this further.
What are the barriers to this happening? 
There are a lot of things that need to coalesce in order for it to be done. The REVS trial has brought up lots of challenges. Part of it is that the standards that V2G chargers need to comply with – the same standards that home solar or battery inverters use – don’t yet fully accommodate the way these chargers operate. 
Additionally, the grid needs to be equipped with the right technology so that the network operators know where V2G response is needed. At this stage, some parts of the grid do and others less so – it is somewhat localised as to where this could happen. 
Another ANU project, EVOLVE, which we are using as part of the Realising Electric Vehicle-to-grid Services project (REVS) programme, is a software-based approach that is helping solve this problem. Evolve allows network operators to know what is going on at finer level on the grid, so we can see where V2G can work, i.e.. is it OK to inject energy at this exact spot? Some distribution networks have the information to be able to implement a system like this, whereas other networks are less sophisticated. There is lots of activity going on at the moment into the capability of the grid, developing new ways to monitor and manage the grid. 
What challenges have you experienced with the REVS project?
At the moment, we are working on the final installation of the chargers. Along the way, we have hit lots of hurdles, for example, the production of the chargers in Spain and then the shipping issues brought on by the pandemic pushed us back.  Getting in market participation and implementing and managing the connection requirements was another challenge. The team has had a real uphill battle, however, it has allowed us to see what is needed to make this happen on a larger scale and we have been publishing lots of information about what’s needed. 
Where and how is the project taking place?
We have 51 vehicles, Nissan LEAFs, on 11 sites in the ACT. The sites were chosen by different parts of the ACT Government opting in to participate in the trial. The cars are used by ACT Government staff such as community nurses, IT support staff and other public servants. Having the ACT Government initiating the idea along with the energy retailer ActewAGL, network evoenergy, and ANU brought together the right consortium of interested parties. Later, Nissan, charging provider JET Charge and fleet provider SG Fleet joined the REVS consortium. 
What do we need to do next to progress this solution?
We need to make this very consumer focused. We need to make the argument to the consumer about why they need to get involved and we need to listen to how they want this to work for them. Do they want to put the energy back into the grid and get paid or would they rather use the technology for their own backup power? More broadly, people are interested in more localised networks where they could just share energy with their family or neighbours, but this isn’t generally possible at the moment. I think the energy industry needs to stop focusing on how it can sell its own ideas to consumers, and give people more space to decide what they want from this kind of technology. Much of the work we are doing at ANU is figuring out in practice how this can be done, working with energy industry stakeholders that are interested in finding out.

At the end of May, US investment bank Goldman Sachs rattled battery metal stocks, forecasting that the price of three key battery materials – cobalt, lithium, and nickel – are heading for a drop over the next two years, as investors have piled in too quickly.
The electrification of the transportation sector caused severe shortages in the lithium-ion battery market last year, leading to soaring raw material prices. But in its report, Goldman declared the battery metals bull market “over for now.”
It went on to explain that the surge in investor capital into supply investment, tied to the long-term EV demand story, has resulted in trading a spot-driven commodity as a forward-looking equity. “That fundamental mispricing has in turn generated an outsized supply response well ahead of the demand trend in focus,” the bank said.
Goldman expects current lithium prices of just under $54,000/ton to plunge to $16,372/ton in 2023. Meanwhile, cobalt prices will go down from around $78,500/ton now to an average of $59,500/ton next year. As for nickel, prices should remain relatively flat, going from $31,000/ton now to $30,250/ton next year. Over the rest of this year, however, Goldman expects a rally in nickel prices to $36,500/ton, after which it will head south.
Between 2022 and 2025, the analysts expect lithium supply to grow on average by 33% year on year, reflecting the ramp-up of new projects in Australia, China and Chile. Cobalt will rise by 14% year on year and nickel by 8% year on year, against annual demand growth rates of 27%, 11% and 7%, respectively.
But some industry observers, including London-based consultants Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, are loudly pushing back. They argue that Goldman’s forecast that a flood of new production will fill the supply deficit is far from likely. Instead, Benchmark believes that lithium market will remain in structural shortage until 2025.
“As the market wrestles between long-term supply security to fuel the lithium-ion economy, and increasingly market-led pricing mechanisms to incentivise supply growth, the era of lithium market volatility is likely just beginning,” Benchmark said in response to Goldman’s research note.
The consultancy goes on to outline five reasons why it feels Goldman’s call is wrong:
But regardless of the speed of expansion in the battery supply chain, there is a consensus that global cumulative capacity is set to grow at an unprecedented pace throughout the decade. According to US analyst Wood Mackenzie, global cumulative lithium-ion battery capacity could rise more than fivefold to 5,500 GWh between 2021 and 2030.
However, according to WoodMac’s base case scenario, supply will not keep pace with demand until some point in 2023. One way to relieve pressure from the supply deficit of battery raw materials is recycling both scrap and end-of-life batteries.
According to WoodMac, current demand for key battery raw materials stands at 97 kilotonnes (kt) for lithium, 186 kt cobalt and 3,014 kt nickel. By 2030, these are expected to grow to 318 kt, 264 kt and 4,273 kt, respectively. However, supply from recycled materials are expected to reach 130 kt for lithium, 112 kt cobalt and 377 kt nickel by the end of the decade, the analyst finds.
However, the challenges of recycling battery raw materials seem inhibiting at present. Firstly, recycling the cathode, which is rich in critical metals, is no easy business as it is overpackaged with pack materials such as casings, interconnects, cooling channels and others. Coupled with an industry push to use lower value materials, the move towards larger-sized EV packs is also a deterrence against recycling due to lower throughput, according to WoodMac.
Secondly, EV packs have long warranties and lifetimes. In addition, the emergence of second-use applications, like residential or industrial energy storage, will also keep end-of-life EVs from entering the recycling system.
As such, WoodMac believes recycling production scrap will be the main source of recycled material this decade. Globally, the analysts expects battery manufacturing capacity to grow 3.5 times to more than 4,621 GWh by 2030, with China leading the way. This presents an increasing market for production scrap.
“At the end of the day, the amount of production scrap or EVs coming to end of life will never be able to meet demand while demand continues to increase. There needs to be a push in expanding virgin sourcing while maximising the recycling sector to ease the deficit,” says WoodMac research analyst Max Reid.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/20/high-wattage-solar-modules-increase-risk-of-thermal-runaway/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 20, 2022",High-wattage solar modules increase risk of thermal runaway,"From pv magazine USA
Due to increases in efficiency and size, high-wattage solar panels are generating higher electrical currents, and thus an increased probability of heat events. Longi Solar has taken note of this as they develop solar modules, and it has released a brief analysis of its modules and junction boxes.
Junction boxes are placed on the back of solar panels, and are the interface that connects the panels to the outside world. Longi was the world’s largest seller of solar panels in 2021, so naturally they sold more junction boxes than any other manufacturer. They also predict that global solar installations will reach 1 TW each year by 2030.
The company notes that the “hot spot durability and diode thermal performance testing” logic is designed in accordance with the IEC 61215 & 62790 standards.
Longi compares its bifacial Hi-MO5 solar modules series, which has a lower front-side short-circuit current value of 13.9A, to a unit with a current of 18.5A. The company said lower voltages produce long-term product stability by lowering module temperatures, and associated temperature swings. It says that higher currents increase the chance of a fire.
Glass-glass bifacial solar panels do have an opportunity to reach 50 year useful lifetimes. Longi’s analysis states that a competing 18.5A module can simply upgrade its junction box to 30A protection and meet a safety margin of 1.25 (accounting for bifacial gains). However, reducing current can limit the number of modules that can be wired on a string, due to lower voltage allowances.
Additionally, the temperature range of this high-current module would place it outside of Longi’s suggested potential thermal runaway zone. Higher temperatures carry higher risks.
Longi explains that hot spots and thermal runaway can occur when modules are shaded while operating outdoors (as opposed to highly controlled lab conditions). This shading can be caused by fallen leaves, an accumulation of dust, or anything that blocks enough light to stop and reverse current, leading to thermal runaway. These hot spots can occur under fairly normal conditions, meaning these conditions must be accounted for as a design standard.
Since higher current panels tend to produce higher temperature hot spots and increased heat build up, Longi concludes that heat dissipation gear must be improved, particularly in equipment that doesn’t meet certain standards.
When these local current leaks occur regularly over decades of expected electricity generation, they silently, and permanently, reduce system output. While manufacturers could potentially mitigate the challenges of high currents with fuses and thicker copper wiring, Longi believes that starting with lower currents is the better solution, for now.
