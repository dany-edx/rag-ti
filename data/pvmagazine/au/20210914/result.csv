Arriving full throttle out of the blue, the company’s founder and CEO Jonathan Eaves told pv magazine Australia this afternoon that he plans to have the first Victorian off-grid data centre up and running by November, fitted with 1 MW of solar, and 48 hour battery and UPS backup technology.
Edge Centres on Monday announced the development approval for the site, which will be in the central Victorian town of Bendigo, about 150 kilometres north of Melbourne.
In case you blinked and missed it, Edge Centres is aiming to rollout a string of grid-independent autonomous data centres across regional Australia powered by ground-mounted and rooftop solar arrays coupled with battery storage. It claims to be the world’s only off-grid edge data centre operator, and its service is set to put regional Australia on a par with metro communications technology for the first time ever, doing so in a carbon negative manner.
Coming back to the Bendigo announcement, Edge Centre’s facility there, the EC3, is to be 100% solar-powered will be built on an block which was previously a car yard. Eaves said he is confident the centre will operational in just two months as the solar array, which will be fully ground mounted in this case, comes in what he calls “kit form,” just like the insulated centre facility itself.
Meaning the only physical installation left is to lay a concrete slab and connect the solar. “Everything else comes ready made,” Eaves told pv magazine Australia.
The company said Bendigo is one of four additional Edge Centre facilities on track to begin operating in Australia this year, including another site in Victoria. So far, the company has four centres online, including a facility in the northern New South Wales (NSW) town of Grafton, as well as three in Queensland, in Townsville, Cairns and Mackay.
Edge Centres
While Grafton, which has been operational since April, is fitted with a 1 MW solar array and backed up by lithium-ion battery storage, Eaves said the Queensland sites all still need to be retrofitted with solar – which is ultimately his plan.
In May, Edge Centres announced a partnership with Japanese IT strategy firm Alan Kei Associates to launch its first data centres in Japan. As far as that venture is concerned, Eaves said land for the Japanese centres have been secured and solar installations will begin next month, in October.
In Australia, regional data processing still generally occurs in metropolitan-based centres, taking time and extra processing power to make the long return journey to more remote areas.
Eaves previously painted a sample picture for pv magazine, saying data coming from a smart ‘agrotech’ tractor working autonomously in regional NSW today would likely travel all the way to Sydney, where the data would be correlated and computed, before the outcome could get sent back.
“Processing at the edge reduces that time, but it also reduces the workload on the internet,” he says. Regional Australia also pays between two to three times as much for data and processing as city-dwellers, meaning their worse experience also has the double kick of costing more.
“Edge centres,” as the facilities themselves are also called, change that by setting up closer to the regional and rural populations they serve, delivering cloud computing resources and cached content to users more efficiently.
“Right now, Australia is on the cusp of an edge infrastructure wave, and Edge Centres is building ahead of this generational spike in demand for IoT, edge computing, and cloud. Building ahead of this wave means that we have time to build and connect the necessary infrastructure so that these regional hubs that haven’t been connected previously can be ready when it hits,” Eaves said.
He noted a handful of companies are now racing to provide these services to the previously forgotten regional populations of Australia.
Eaves is no stranger to data centre design and construction, having built centres in Australia and in the United Arab Emirates.
His newly minted company is specifically targeting internet service providers, retail service providers and managed service providers with services including cloud connect, dark fibre, and IP transit. These are delivered through data centre designs that are minimally dependent on utility power and have a carbon-negative footprint, the company says.
Its sites are “carrier-neutral,” it added, to encourage competition, enrich its ecosystem, and to drive down prices for the customer.
Over the next 18 months, Edge Centres plans to scale its business across Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and Japan, hoping to reach 20 sites by the end of 2022.

Solar carparks are becoming increasingly popular in Australian shopping centres, and now the trend seems to have spread to regional organisations.
With work set to start in October, East Grampians will install its 174 kW solar system on both the roof of its new undercover carpark, and will also transform its current visitor carpark into undercover solar-shaded parking, providing weather protection for visitors and of course generating electricity for the Health Service.
The installation is expected to take around four months to complete, and will be paid for through the Victorian government’s $2.7 billion ‘Building Works’ package. The medical centre’s installation is the final of nine installations for the program in the Grampians region.
In addition to solar systems, the government’s funding package also supported the installation of battery storage – though of the nine program recipients, only the Ballarat General Cemetery in Ballarat North received a solar+battery coupling.
The East Grampians Health Service solar project is to be delivered in partnership with Ballarat Renewable Energy and Zero Emissions Inc (BREAZE) − one of nine in the Grampians region to receive a share of $1.1 million to install solar power on buildings.
BREAZE President Mary Debrett said the program demonstrates the “benefits of social solar” including jobs, bill savings and reduced emissions.

South Korea-based solar module manufacturer Hanwha Q Cells will invest a total of KRW1.5 trillion (AU$1.7 billion) over the next five years to expand solar module manufacturing capacity and increase research and development activities in its home country.
“The overall investment plan will include a 3.1 GW production capacity expansion in Korea, with the plan being to expand Q Cells’ Korean production capacity to 7.6 GW by 2025,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “Some of the funds from this investment pledge will be steered towards TOPCon and tandem perovskite technology… however, the 1.5 trillion figure is intended to be invested into a number of avenues.”
“The expanded production capacity will include perovskite and TOPCon lines, but it is as yet undetermined what precise capacity this will be,” the spokesperson went on to say, without providing further details.
The South Korean market is expected to see the deployment of more than 15 GW of PV capacity by the end of the decade and several domestic manufacturers are competing to secure a slice of this cake, including module manufacturer Hyundai Energy Solutions, among others. Hyundai is planning to build a 1.37 GW facility and recently opened a 750 MW panel factory in Eumseong county, in South Korea’s North Chungcheong province, which brought its current module capacity of 1.35 GW.
South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (Motie) introduced carbon footprint rules for solar modules in May 2020. These rules are similar to those applied in France, where large scale solar tenders take low-carbon manufacturing into account, as well as the price developers agree to accept for the power generated. South Korea, like France, has an extensive nuclear power generation capacity which aids the low-carbon efforts of domestic solar panel manufacturers.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/14/regional-strategy-to-turbocharge-indonesian-solar/,"FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDONESIA,PAPUA NEW GUINEA",MAX HALL,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2021",Regional strategy to turbocharge Indonesian solar,"From pv magazine Global
A study prepared by the governments of Indonesia and Denmark has suggested a series of regional solar capacity targets can help the South East Asian nation to emission reduction targets which include having renewables supply 23% of its power mix by 2025.
The Renewable Energy Pipeline proposed by Indonesia’s Department for Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation (Energi Baru Terbarukan dan Konservasi Energi) and the Danish Energy Agency has called for 2,379 MW of solar generation capacity to be added next year, as part of 6,713 MW of new projects by 2025, and 14,867 MW by 2030.
Far from being over-ambitious, the authors of the document stated developers have already committed to around 2.82 GW of new solar by 2025, and 7.87 GW this decade.
With Indonesian solar tenders having recently established prices of around $0.04/kWh, and expected to hit $0.037 in the next round of awards, the report’s authors estimated new solar farms will be competitive against legacy coal plants in 2023.
Similar cost calculations, however, prompted the authors of the study to discount widespread deployment of solar-plus-storage projects at this stage as the price of energy storage tech would reduce competitiveness. The document states the Indonesian grid can cope with the scale of intermittent renewables planned in the strategy without the need for energy storage at this point.
The regional plan considers five renewable energy technologies, although it acknowledges the risk associated with the suggested dominance of geothermal – alongside hydro – in many regions, given the uncertain nature of the costs and lead times associated with the former. Discounting geothermal would require another 7 GW of solar by 2025, the study stated, for 13.7 GW of new photovoltaic capacity by that stage.
Although the largest volume of new generation capacity is envisaged in the Java-Bali region – 1,058 MW next year, 3,298 MW by 2025, and 6,738 MW by 2030 – solar would supply only 1.8% of the renewable electricity needed in that zone to keep Indonesia on track with its clean energy targets.
PV modules would generate around 2% of the clean power needed nationally under the proposed regional plan and the solar contribution would amount to 4.5% in Nusa Tenggara, achieved by adding 131 MW of generation capacity next year, 161 MW by 2025, and 511 MW this decade. Some 401 MW of solar in Kalimantan next year, as part of 924 MW in four years’ time, and 2,504 MW by 2030, would see photovoltaics supply 3.7% of that region’s clean electricity.
Just 15 MW of panels in Papua next year, as part of subsequent totals of 75 MW and 255 MW of new solar, would see PV generate 2.5% of that region’s clean electricity, and Sulawesi would rely on solar for 2.3% of its renewable energy, thanks to 279 MW next year, as part of 2025 and 2030 numbers of 729 MW and 1,629 MW, respectively.
Solar’s smallest contribution is suggested in Maluku, which would require just 25 MW of project capacity next year, towards 55 MW in 2025, and 155 MW in 2030.
In terms of already planned capacity, Java-Bali has the highest figure, with solar developers having announced 4,195 MW of opportunities. The next highest figure is the 943 MW of solar projects planned in Sumatra. The latter region is earmarked to have the next largest volumes of solar added after Java-Bali, under the regional proposal, with 471 MW required next year, as part of 1,471 MW by 2025, and 3,075 MW by 2030.
