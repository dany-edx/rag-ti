Stand-alone power systems (SAPS) which consist of a solar array, battery and back-up generator, have proven wildly successful in WA, where the state-government-owned energy suppliers, Western Power and Horizon Power, have already transitioned 52 properties throughout the Mid West, Goldfields, eastern Wheatbelt and Great Southern regions to SAPS. It calculates that even with servicing the systems throughout their expected life cycle, the utility will save $6 million dollars on not having to refurbish the network to ensure reliability of supply to those properties.
Given the success of the trials and Phase One rollout, the Government plans to continue to monopolise on the solution, which is becoming increasingly refined.
The additional 1000 systems will be installed in regional properties and in remote Aboriginal communities, and are intended to reduce the reliance on diesel as well as stabilise networks.
Crucially, the program will be declared a “Strategic Project” under the WA Jobs Act, a bid to support local manufacturing. “The commitment of more than 1,000 standalone power systems will create a baseline demand for locally manufactured power systems, including solar panels, batteries and hydrogen electrolysers – driving hundreds of local manufacturing jobs and putting WA at the forefront of high-tech industries,” the Governments statement said.
An additional $10 million is to be invested in wind turbine manufacturing, specifically supporting the development of a WA-based industry. Any future wind farm projects undertaken by government trading enterprises will be classified as a “Strategic Project” under the WA Jobs Act, prioritising local manufacturing.
The Government has also promised $15 million for a Carbon Innovation Grants program to fund research and innovative trials to increase carbon sequestration, capture, utilisation and storage. A further $1 million will be devoted to funding research into the viability of local and environmentally sustainable processing of iron ore to create green steel.
Again following where there is already momentum, the Labor Government has promised to establish a “small energy industry development team” to work with local renewable energy  manufacturers and the mining industry to accelerate the transition to renewables on remote mine sites.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/19/blueprint-for-australias-first-green-hydrogen-project-hit-asx-to-colossal-fanfare/,"HYDROGEN,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 19, 2021",Blueprint for Australia’s first green Hydrogen project hit ASX to colossal fanfare,"Province Resources’ ambitious vision to create Australia’s first green hydrogen project, HyEnergy, is currently little more than a sparkle in the company’s eyes, but it has been met with huge fanfare after it was revealed on Wednesday.
The gold and nickel exploration company’s stock price (ASX: PRL) jumped 262% following the “news” of its green hydrogen project – which currently really only consists a conditional agreement to acquire company Ozexco Pty Ltd which holds seven license applications in the Gascoyne region just south of Carnarvon in WA, deemed suitable for developing a renewable green hydrogen project.
Seeing the preliminary nature of the plan as no reason to hesitate, Province Resources, formerly Scandivanadium, have gone ahead and registered Zero Carbon Hydrogen as a trademark, leading to bold headlines about the “arrival” on green hydrogen on Australia’s shores. Investor website Next Investors even claimed Province Resources may just be its stock pick of the year.
Green hydrogen has dominated renewables news this year, with a slate of announcements in Australia testament to a hy-geist. With Australia eager to position itself as a key exporter of hydrogen, and big names like Twiggy Forrest singing its praises, Province Resources seems to have trademarked a clever name right in a sweet spot.
Contributing to excitement about the company and its green hydrogen dreams is its ties to the team at Vulcan Resources, which trademarked Zero Carbon Lithium, and has become something of a market darling. It is being reported that Vulcan’s co-founder and CEO Francis Wedin has invested in Province Resources and is signed on an advisor to the company.
With a number of Australian governments also keen to jump about the hydrogen-fuelled train, Province’s HyEnergy Project could stand to benefit from funds designed to boost the country’s emergent green hydrogen industry. The proposed site is not far from Dampier Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline and as well as export infrastructure, which will certainly prove helpful.
The company’s vision is to generate 1 GW of renewable energy in Western Australia using wind and solar and to produce approximately 60,000 tonnes of green hydrogen or up to approximately 300,000 tonnes of green ammonia.
The acquisition of Ozexco, the company that currently holds the license applications in the proposed region, is subject to shareholder approval at its general meeting. Province Resources has also received commitments to raise $1.35 million via a placement at 1.5 cents per share, with board members committing $250,000 – which hardly sounds like enough money for such a pioneering project, but given the share price surge and warm reception of the plan, capital raising hardly feels like the biggest hurdle.
It seems Australian markets are hungry for hydrogen and intoxicated by the prospect of something other than fossil fuels keeping exports alive.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/19/australian-assets-prove-pivotal-for-neoens-strong-2020-results/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 19, 2021",Australian assets prove pivotal for Neoen’s strong 2020 results,"French company Neoen has been busy in Australia – its 2020 results, released on Thursday, are testament to that. Highlighting its November win for the Victorian Big Battery contract, the company also pointed to its completion of financing for Western Downs, Australia’s largest solar farm, as well as its PPA with CleanCo Queensland as high points from the previous year.
Not only is the company’s future looking promising after being awarded over 1 GW in new projects during 2020, so too is its present – Neoen’s consolidated revenue in 2020 reached €298.8 million (AU$465 million). At constant exchange rates, the sum amounts to a revenue increase of
20%. The company said the key factor driving growth was the contribution from assets commissioned in 2019 and 2020.
Solar’s contribution to Neoen’s consolidated revenue stood at 48% in 2020, versus 47% in 2019. Echoing the growth of the company as a whole, solar grew 20% compared to the previous year. Wind revenue rose 10% from 2019, while storage revenue grew the most, totalling €32.7 million (AU$50 million) in 2020, up from €20.5 million (AU$32 million) the year before.

This spike in storage was, as the company puts it, “a result of specific non-recurring conditions in Australia.” This “specific non-recurring condition” was a tornado that ripped through Australia in January 2020, downing the Heywood interconnector between South Australia and Victoria. It effectively isolated SA from the rest of the National Energy Market (NEM) for 18 days, leading the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to use Neoen’s Hornsdale Power Reserve, better known as SA’s big Tesla battery, and two other smaller batteries – Dalrymple ESCRI and Lake Bonney – to maintain grid reliability and keep electricity prices down. This created, in Neoen’s words, “specific conditions generating a high level of non-recurring revenue.”
Despite being buoyed by the one-off event, Neoen’s storage revenue was actually lower in the last three quarters of the year compared to 2019. This was because of weaker demand for electricity in Australia over that time – presumably due to COVID-19 shutdowns. This, in turn, created “less favourable” market conditions for grid service sales, or FCAS markets. All in all, storage revenue accounted for 11% of consolidated revenue in 2020, up from 8% one year earlier.
Lady luck proved herself fickle for the company in Australia elsewhere too, with the company saying its total revenue was “held back by less supportive irradiation conditions in Australia throughout the year.” Grid upgrades meant one of its Australian assets had reduced availability. This coupled with the downturn in market prices in Australia over the last three quarters of 2020 dampened the ascent.
Nonetheless, 2020 was kinder to the company than the world at large. “The end of the year was particularly dynamic with the win of the Victorian Big Battery project in Australia, one of the world’s largest batteries,” Xavier Barbaro, Neoen’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said.
In November, Neoen announced it had been awarded a 250 MW grid services contract by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) laying the groundwork for its 300 MW / 450 MWh battery project. Again delivered together with Tesla, using its Megapack technology, as well as network partner AusNet Services, the battery is to be built next to Moorabool Terminal Station in Geelong.
Just a month earlier, in October, Neoen also announced it had signed a PPA with CleanCo Queensland for 110 MW of wind energy. It was the second agreement contracted in 2020 between the two companies, after the signature of 352 MWp power purchase agreement for Western Downs Green Power Hub. The contract will enable Neoen to build the 157 MW Kaban wind farm near the town of Ravenshoe, 80 km south west of Cairns, Australia, delivering clean energy into Powerlink Queensland’s transmission network.
The company also completed the financing for Western Downs, set to be Australia’s largest solar farm at 460 MWp near Chinchilla in South West Queensland.
Of the 1.4 GW Neoen has in assets under construction, the 214 MW Bulgana wind farm in Australia, which includes 20 MW in storage, is already generating electricity and should enter into operation in the first half of 2021. The Victorian Big Battery and the Western Downs solar facility are scheduled to enter into operation in the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2022, respectively.
The company’s capacity in operation or under construction stood at 4.1 GW at December 31, 2020, compared to 3.0 GW at the end of December 2019 – solidifying its position as a global player and an Australian powerhouse.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/19/regulator-credits-renewables-for-continuing-fall-in-electricity-prices/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"FEBRUARY 19, 2021",Regulator credits renewables for continuing fall in electricity prices,"The Australian Energy Regulator (AER) has released its draft determination for the Default Market Offer (DMO) 2021-2022, and it is good news for consumers, especially if you live in New South Wales, south-east Queensland (QLD) and South Australia (SA). The good news is that electricity prices are set to fall, and not only that, but they now seem to be falling continuously, as if they’d fallen down the stairs in an M. C. Escher lithograph.
The DMO, which was introduced in 2019, is a reference price for consumers to compare against retail electricity contracts and also caps the price retailers can charge consumers on a standing offer contract. The DMO 2021-22 will see a reduction in electricity prices as compared to DMO 2020-21 of between 4.6% and 7.9% for residential customers (region dependent) and between 4.1% and 8.5% for small business consumers (also region dependent).
To proffer an example, if you’re one of the 60,000 South Australians on legacy – or standing offers, the savings for average customers in 2021-22 could total as much as $117 for residential consumers as compared to the year previous, and $342 if you’re one of the more than 10,000 small businesses.

“Since the introduction of the DMO in 2019, residential and small business standing offer consumers have seen their yearly bills reduce by hundreds of dollars,” said AER Chair Clare Savage, “We have also seen retailer competition remain steady.”
“It’s also critical for consumers to remember the DMO is intended as a safety net for those who don’t or can’t shop around and it’s not designed to be the most competitive deal,” continued Savage. “Most retailers have cheaper energy deals on offer, so shopping around remains the best way to get the best price.”
South Australian Minister for Energy and Mining, Dan van Holst Pellekaan, said the draft DMO continues the good work, which has seen electricity bills fall by $111 since the middle of 2020. Moreover, Pellekaan added that more savings are on the horizon, particularly with the development of the SA-NSW interconnector, which has been “modelled to deliver an additional $100 cut to power bills for households”.
According to the AER, the main factor driving these decreasing prices is the “continued strong investments in renewable generation” which is changing the shape of load profiles and reducing wholesale energy costs. AER’s draft also found that the “median effective price paid by customers with solar systems was around 24% lower than non-soar customers in DMO regions and Victoria.”
The draft DMO prices for 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022 is no open for public submissions until 18 March.
