The supply announcement complements the university’s established solar carpark and rooftop systems, which were already supplying 20% of the main campus’ electricity needs. The deal means Flinders has now achieved net-zero emissions from electricity.
“Our Bedford Park campus currently generates 2.22 MW of renewable energy from solar installations on building roof tops and car parks (including 4,136 panels over carpark 3), with more recent additions increasing that number to 7,467 panels, and we are continuously assessing future investments in renewable energy. We have also recently installed 13 new electric-vehicle charging stations and begun to transition our vehicle fleet to electric vehicles,” Vice-Chancellor Professor Colin Stirling said in a statement.
Not satisfied with net-zero emissions from electricity, the Vice-Chancellor says the university is gearing up to be one of the first carbon-positive tertiary institutions through a range of renewable supply and storage projects.
“We’ve set a clear target on becoming carbon positive and this announcement demonstrates our ongoing commitment to champion sustainability by working with industry to address real world challenges,” Stirling added.
“Climate change is an important area of research at Flinders University and we are showing that we can ‘walk the talk’ when it comes to meaningful change in our energy operations.”
Last year, the University of Sydney made a raft of commitments across a range of sustainability fronts, most notably a commitment to source 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025 and reach net zero emissions by 2030. Yet despite announcing in 2015 that it would divest from fossil fuels after a referendum found overwhelming support, a freedom of information inquest reveal it was still holding $22.4 million worth of coal, oil and gas investments in 2019.
Victoria’s La Trobe University is well on its way to achieving its ‘net zero’ carbon emissions by 2029 goal, while the University of Melbourne and Monash have both set goals to become carbon neutral before 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/03/solar-loving-town-to-construct-pv-carpark-shade-with-federal-grant-money-%e2%80%a8/,"COMMUNITY,EV,INSTALLATIONS,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 3, 2021",Solar-loving town to construct PV carpark shade with federal grant money,"The project, which is set to begin construction in April, will feature a roof composed of 99.9 kW solar PV system over 40 public carparks in the Clyde Campbell Carpark as well as an electric vehicle car-charging station, providing shade and battery juice for those visiting the city in northeastern New South Wales.
Maintenance costs for the structure will be funded by revenue made from feeding the panel’s solar energy back into the grid. Solar carpark shade structures are becoming increasingly popular, with Australia’s largest shopping centre, Vicinity Centres’ Fashion Capital in Chadstone, announcing it would add more than 400 solar shaded parking bays in December of last year.
The tender for Lismore’s construction solar structure will be released this month and construction is expected to begin shortly after.
The project will be paid for through a $1 million grant provided by the Federal Government’s Drought Communities Program which has been given to 52 NSW councils to complete infrastructure and other drought-relief projects. Lismore council will spend $650,000 of its grant on the Clyde Campbell Carpark structure, with the remainder allocated to train local landholders on Natural Sequence Farming, a technique to retain water in farming landscapes during times of drought.
“Our community has consistently said they want Council to tackle the impacts of climate change, increase the use of renewable energy and provide more shade throughout the Lismore CBD for locals and visitors,” Deputy Mayor Neil Marks said in a statement.
“This project delivers on all of that and will also provide an electric car-charging station for Lismore, which is exciting news and I’m sure the first of many to come.”
Lismore has been home to number of renewable initiatives over the last decade. The push began in 2013, when the Council undertook what it says is the largest community consultation in its 134-year history. It found residents’ top priority was the environment with the desire to become a model for sustainability.
This consultation period gave rise to Lismore’s Renewable Energy Master Plan, which set a goal to self-generate all electricity from renewable source by 2023. According to the Council’s 2019/2020 report, it had installed 19 solar systems which had resulted in a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions since 2012. Currently, 16% of Council’s energy generated by renewable sources.
Lismore City Council
Notably, in 2018, the Council partnered with Farming the Sun to launch the Lismore Community Solar initiative which, at the time, was the first Council/community owned solar farm in the country and Australia’s largest floating solar farm.
As part of the initiative, Council established two 100kW solar farms – a rooftop solar farm at Goonellabah Sports & Aquatic Centre and a floating solar farm on the overflow ponds at the East Lismore Sewage Treatment Plant.
The floating solar farm model, designed and constructed by Suntrix, was selected to overcome spatial constraints at the sewage plant. It also provides capacity for the solar farm to expand across the overflow ponds. Reportedly, the cooling properties of water help the solar panels last longer and perform better, and the increased shade over the pond reduces evaporation and algal growth. The Council’s aim is to eventually power the sewage treatment plant from 100% solar energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/03/rectifier-unveils-ev-charging-converter-said-to-remedy-manufacturers-pain-points/,"EV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 3, 2021",Rectifier unveils EV charging converter said to remedy manufacturers’ ‘pain points’,"Rectifier Technologies’ new isolated power converter, the RT22, is a 50kW electric vehicle (EV) charging module which can be simply stacked to increase capacity.
The RT22 also has reactive power control built into it, which reduces grid impact by providing a mechanism to regulate grid voltage levels. The converter opens the door for charger manufacturers to engineer High Power Charging (HPC) or fast charging suitable for city centres too, as the module is compliant to a number of standardised class categories.
The converter boasts an efficiency of more than 96% and a wide output voltage range between 50VDC to 1000VDC. Rectifier says this enables the converter to cater to battery voltages of all EVs currently available, including electric buses and new passenger EVs.
“We have put in the time to understand the pain points of HPC manufacturers and engineered a product that addresses as many of those issues as possible,” Nicholas Yeoh, Director of Sales at Rectifier Technologies, said in a statement.
As High Powered DC charging networks of a similar size and power are rolled out across the world, electricity networks will be placed under increasing strain as they draw large and intermittent amounts of power which may cause voltage fluctuations. To add to this, network operators face difficulty installing HPCs without expensive network upgrades.
 Rectifier says the RT22’s reactive power control remedies these issues, reducing network costs and offering greater flexibility in installation locations.
Each RT22 EV charger module is rated at 50kW, with the company saying it is strategically sized to meet the defined power classes of DC Electric Vehicle chargers. For example, if a HPC manufacturer wants to create a 350kW high powered charger, they can simply connect seven RT22 modules in parallel, within the power enclosure.
“As electric vehicle adoption continues to increase and battery technologies improve, the demand for HPCs will consequently rise as they play a key role in the facilitation of long distance travel,” Yeoh said.
“The most powerful HPCs today sit at around 350kW, but higher capacities are being discussed and engineered to prepare for the electrification of heavier vehicles, such as freight trucks.”
“With Class B EMC compliance, the RT22 can start from a lower noise foundation and thus be more suitable to being installed within an urban environment where electromagnetic interference (EMI) must be limited,” Yeoh added.
Currently, HPCs are mostly confined to highways, but Rectifier believes as EV penetration grows, so too will the demand for HPCs in urban centres.
“While the RT22 alone does not ensure the entire HPC will be Class B compliant – as there are many other factors beyond power supply that affect EMC – it makes sense to offer it at the power convertor level first and foremost,” Yeoh said. “With a compliant power converter, it is more possible to create a compliant charger.
“From the RT22, HPC manufacturers have the foundational piece of equipment required for charger manufacturers to potentially engineer a HPC suitable for urban areas.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/03/wa-announces-states-largest-vpp-pilot-funded-by-state-and-hopefully-federal-budgets/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 3, 2021","WA announces state’s largest VPP pilot, allocating $35m","The pilot, named Project Symphony, is expected to see over 500 households and businesses participating in a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) pilot to demonstrate how large numbers of batteries, rooftop solar panels and large appliances like air conditioners and electric hot water systems can be co-ordinated to the benefit of the grid and consumers.
The pilot is being developed by Western Power and Synergy, both state-owned, together with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and Energy Policy WA. The state’s McGowan Government has committed $27 million to the two-stage $35 million project, and Federal funding being sought for the remainder.
The Perth suburb of Southern River has been chosen to host the VPP as almost 50% of households in the suburb have rooftop solar. Due to Australia’s world leading rooftop solar penetration, the country seems to present the ideal preconditions for widespread VPP adoption – a concept which has gained considerable momentum in the last year.
By aggregating energy from a large fleet, it becomes possible to open up new sources of revenue through participation in the spot market, FCAS market and other markets closed off to individual households. Participation in such markets, in the aggregate, creates an economic incentive for solar and battery storage installations and gives consumers a way to understand that additional value is available to them.
As seems to be the focus of the West Australian government, VPPs also help balance electricity supply and demand, by storing excess energy and adjusting how much energy is being used in real time.
“Using Virtual Power Plants means there is less of a need for traditional generation assets, such as coal or gas, which is a step towards a more sustainable power system,” the state’s Energy Minister, Bill Johnston, said in a statement.
“It will lay the groundwork for a future where household energy devices help keep the power system stable, enabling more and more renewable energy on the grid.”
Project Symphony will build on previous trials run by Western Power and Synergy and will also benefit from the experience of Horizon Power’s Onslow Renewable Energy Pilot. Onslow, a coastal town in the Pilbara region, was in 2016 chosen by Horizon Power to become the site of a pioneering distributed energy resource (DER) incorporating a solar plant, gas power station, grid-scale battery storage, plus rooftop solar, residential batteries. The pilot has proven successful and was last year nominated for an award recognising it for having one of the world’s most advanced microgrids.
VPPs are already fairly well established in the Eastern states, especially in South Australia, with the West Australian government intending to glean some of this knowledge and adapt it for “local conditions.”
It is hoped the pilot will also pave the way for more innovative use of VPPs across WA’s main electricity grid.

The project on the NSW and Australian Capital Territory (ACT) border will likely commence construction in summer with the installation of 260,936 panels at 460 Wp each, an onsite substation and a battery storage system. The panels will be positioned on single axis tracking structures and will generate around 260,000 MWh of solar energy annually.
Key to the $170m project is its agrivoltaic symbiosis. The 163 hectare property currently works as a sheep farm, and will continue to do so once the solar array is erected. The symbiotic relationship between solar panels and vegetation meaning that the sheep will have more to chew on than ever before. With the panels situated at a maximum elevation of 2.3m and with 5m between each row there is more than enough space for the sheep to graze.
In Q1 2021, pv magazine’s UP initiative will shine a spotlight on agrivoltaics – the combination of agriculture and solar energy – in recognition of this emerging market. The goal is to understand the potential benefits, and economic, political and technical challenges of such an innovative partnership. Make sure you stay informed!
Moreover, the site’s is proposed to feature approximately 22,000 permanent native plants, including six species to provide ground cover and 19 species to provide a vegetation screen which will also double as a bee haven. Native species like the Fan Flower, Grevillea, Goodenia, Jug Flower and Native Daisy are all great attractors of bees, birds, butterflies and other species. The plants themselves also ensure the site will require a minimum of maintenance thanks to the better drainage from deep native rooted plants.

Univergy Solar’s Executive President ,Ignacio Blanco, said “Australia is a market with enormous potential for the development clean energy, which makes it a strategic country for Univergy. The development of this first 120 MW park together with our partner New Energy Developments , has improved our know-how in this market and we are confident of being able to expand our presence in the country through the development of future projects.”
In a statement to local residents, New Energy Development (NED) provided an update on what they described as a 100 MW development capable of producing clean renewable energy for approximately 48,000 NSW and ACT homes annually for the next three decades. NED also informed locals that they would be able to purchase said green energy at a discounted rate through the Localvolts Electricity Exchange, a peer-to-peer platform for the buying and selling of energy.
At this stage NED is currently preparing the project’s environment impact statement (EIS) and is seeking NSW State Significant Development status.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/03/are-japans-upstream-players-heading-for-the-exit/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,JAPAN",,"FEBRUARY 3, 2021",Are Japan’s upstream players heading for the exit? ,"From Wood Mackenzie’s APAC Energy Buzz. 
Faced with competition from new sectors, upstream investment is under pressure  
Japan’s trading houses are re-thinking their long-term strategies around upstream investment. Last week, as Mitsui closed the sale of its BassGas stake in Australia, Sumitomo announced it will no longer participate in new oil projects. Sojitz had already announced a move away from upstream and Marubeni has kickstarted a process to sell off some of its upstream positions, including the UK North Sea. If 2020 was a year for the re-evaluation of future plans, then 2021 looks to be the year of implementation. 
Moves by Japan’s trading houses to de-risk their upstream portfolios make sense. Faced with falling domestic oil and gas demand and an accelerating energy transition, future E&P investment is far less certain. Strategy reviews are switching focus to new growth areas – covering everything from fintech to pork bellies – with the increasingly diverse businesses of Japan’s trading houses challenging upstream for future capital.   
To understand this changing outlook and the implications for the sector, I caught up with Angus Rodger, APAC Upstream Research Director. 
Global upstream’s quiet investors  
Japan is one of the great industrial economies, despite its extremely limited natural resources. Energy of course is critical to this, with the country having invested hundreds of billions of dollars worldwide to ensure the secure supply of coal, oil and LNG.  
This hasn’t been limited to procurement contracts and multilateral financing. Collectively, and with little fanfare, Japanese companies – from pure-play E&Ps and integrated oil and gas companies, to gas and power utilities and trading houses – have built material upstream portfolios. Today, the upstream assets of ‘Japan Inc’ are valued at over US$70 billion, producing around 1.6 million boe/d. Trading houses making up almost 30% of this total. But with domestic oil and gas demand falling, the driver for Japanese firms to go out and secure international resources is weakening. 
Winds of change blowing across Japan’s upstream sector 
The upstream businesses of Japanese trading houses have reached a critical juncture. For some, upstream is already looks non-core, seen by management and shareholders as a high-risk and capital-intensive sector, originally pursued in response to Japan’s lack of indigenous resources but increasingly non-critical to future growth. In addition, Japan’s trading houses typically hold small equity stakes in large, long-life LNG and oil projects. This has created portfolios with longevity, but little control or operator experience and lacking exposure to key global growth themes, such as deepwater and unconventionals. 
As their businesses diversify across energy and non-energy sectors, upstream is feeling the pinch. Japan’s recently announced 2050 net zero target has piled on the pressure. 
The response is an increased focus on upstream portfolio rationalisation, and we expect the divestment of non-operated stakes in smaller oil and other non-core assets to gather pace. For several companies, beyond existing positions in LNG that are likely to remain intact, everything else may go. This is the sharp end of the energy transition. 
Not all trading houses are equal 
Mitsubishi and Mitsui account for over 80% of upstream portfolio value among Japan’s trading houses. And while oil assets may be increasingly peripheral, both have strong medium-term production and cash flow metrics as LNG projects in Mozambique, Russia and Canada come onstream. Others are in less fortunate positions. 
But regardless of size, all trading houses face challenging longer-term growth outlooks due to mature portfolios, a lack of new development assets, and executive management teams increasingly reluctant to allocate precious capital to upstream investments. At the same time, many are also facing an increasing call on cash flow from upstream projects to support new energy investments. As a part of last week’s announcement that it will no longer invest in new oil projects, Sumitomo also revealed it will shift its focus to renewable energy investment. A similar narrative is being heard across the trading houses, referencing solar, wind, hydrogen and other new energy technologies. 
Can Japan’s trading houses successfully divest? 
Those trading houses looking to divest assets face headwinds. Equity positions are typically small, and some come wrapped up in complex Japanese JVs (Tangguh LNG, for example), potentially limiting buyer interest. Another increasing issue will be perceived ESG risk. Japanese upstream investments in oil sands, US Lower 48 (fracking) and the Arctic will be scrutinised by investors and financial institutions, particularly European banks looking to limit exposure to companies and projects in these areas.  
On the plus side, we are increasingly positive around future M&A market activity. There are encouraging signs that debt markets are improving, with potential buyers accessing capital easier than in 2020, supported by stronger oil and gas prices and a weaker US dollar. There are buyers out there, but lots of sellers too – last week, South Korea’s KNOC also announced it was putting its North Sea portfolio up for sale, suggesting the ‘upstream question’ is not just being asked in Tokyo. More asset sales and company restructuring can be expected. 
Implications for the wider Japanese E&P sector 
Despite recent announcements, it’s important to point out that changing strategies do not necessarily signal a wholesale rush to the exit by Japan’s E&P companies. In many ways, they are getting ahead of the curve. Indeed, many will also be looking to take advantage of a buyer’s market, with numerous geographical and thematic options opening as IOCs expand divestment campaigns. There are well-priced opportunities out there, as evidenced this week by PTTEP’s deal to buy a stake in BP’s Omani Khazzan field. 
Bigger players like INPEX have ambitious future production targets and will look to leverage a strengthening balance sheet to acquire undervalued upstream assets and diversify growth themes. For those small and medium-sized Japanese players, nimbleness is key as they look to target specialised capabilities, such as JXTG focusing on CO2 and EOR opportunities. And ongoing US shale gas purchases hint at a more counter-cyclical, integrated strategy from LNG players Tokyo Gas and Osaka Gas. 
But there’s no doubt that for all Japanese E&P players, the strategic choices look hard. But Japan Inc won’t be disappearing from global upstream anytime soon. The potential for the Japanese government to play a role in facilitating upstream asset swaps or sectoral consolidation, allowing focused players to gain upstream scale while allowing others a route to exit, could hold the key to the future.

The handover sees the imminent establishment of the Mojo Marketplace, where small business and corporate customers to purchase locally produced renewable energy in the form of a standard retail energy contract, something nascent for the Australian market. 
By way of explanation, WePower’s CTO and Co-founder, Kaspar Kaarlep, told pv magazine Australia how electricity generated by the Robinvale Solar Farm in Victoria (VIC) can now reach business customers. “The initial wholesale PPA between Robinvale’s owners and Mojo is tokenised by WePower and stored on the Ethereum blockchain so that it can be structured into smaller retail PPAs and made available to these customers.” Thanks to the clear and trackable blockchain technology this tokenisation forms a “direct contractual link between the generating project and the end customer’s energy purchase.”

Ultimately then, the technology allows WePower to form itself into the “connective tissue” between industry consumers and renewable energy generators. For consumers it means easier access to said energy in an online shopping environment, and for producers it means easier access to consumers. 
“With wholesale energy prices at historic lows due to the surge in renewable generation capacity in Australia, retail PPAs provide energy users with exposure to these low wholesale prices,” continued Kaarlep, “effectively locking in savings over traditional retail energy for the life of the contract.”
Unfortunately, businesses which have already installed their own solar systems cannot contribute to the virtual power plant (VPP) at this time but, as Kaarlep notes, “they can supplement their retail PPA purchase with solar power generated behind the meter. Such ‘behind the meter’ generation and storage can be readily incorporated into the retail agreement. It’s contribution to the overall supply will be tracked by the Marketplace alongside the external renewable project.”  
Mojo also has contracts with the Riverina Solar Farm in NSW, and several more large-scale solar farms throughout VIC, NSW, and Queensland (QLD). Generation from these farms will eventually be added to the Mojo Marketplace along with multiple other agreements currently in the pipeline.
