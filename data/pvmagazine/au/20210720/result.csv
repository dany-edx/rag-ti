Dubbed Renaissance One, the facility will be the flagship of Energy Renaissance, which intends to ramp up production to 5.3 GWh per annum of its trademarked lithium-ion superStorage batteries for Australia and southeast Asian markets in coming years. The facility is slated for completion in February, 2022.
Energy Renaissance
Tomago, on the outskirts of Newcastle, has access to both a world-class port and a heaving skilled labour force from its long history in coal mining. Importantly, it is also home to the CSIRO’s Energy Centre research hub – an long partner of Energy Renaissance.
Energy Renaissance has previously received $246,625 from the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre to develop its unique hot-climate-optimised battery modules — the cell housing — that can be scaled for numerous applications from battery packs suitable for installation at the base of a streetlight, to commercial-size and grid-supporting energy storage. This new set of funding, the company said, “will allow rapid testing and the development of a scalable, manufacturing line and trained workforce that will inform the technology, systems and processes for Renaissance One.”
“AMGC has played a strategic role by supporting Energy Renaissance with a seed funding round last year that went towards the design and prototyping of our superStorage battery. The new funding injection from AMGC will now help us to scale-up towards commercial production and accelerate our ability to manufacture batteries faster. This is a win for Australia, our economy and workforce as we ascend the stage to become a global battery manufacturing powerhouse,” Energy Renaissance’s Technology and Development Director, Brian Craighead, said.

In a recent report from the Future Battery Industries, the body outlined that for Australia to truly seize on the opportunity afforded by the imminent global battery boom, it needs to look beyond its historic role as a supplier of raw materials and broaden the horizons by adding value with downstream products and manufacturing. This drive to bring renewable manufacturing back onshore is catching wind, with Queensland Minister for Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen, Mick De Brenni, just this morning calling for the “re-industrialisation of our nation,” singling out the storage industry in particular.
“Australia relies heavily on imported batteries, a reliance Energy Renaissance is committed to changing. By investing in local manufacturing, upskilling a new workforce for manufacturing and developing an innovative battery solution, Energy Renaissance will showcase how Australia can and will have a global competitive edge in battery manufacturing,” AMGC’s Managing Director, Dr Jens Goennemann said.

Energy Renaissance says its Tomago pilot project “will validate the sovereign capabilities that Australia has for the manufacturing of energy storage systems and demonstrate a stronger and more integrated Australian supply chain for key battery components and battery management systems.” The ultimate goal not only for the company but for the Australian storage industry more generally is to capture a greater share of supply-chain value-adding.
In a previous interview with pv magazine Australia, Energy Renaissance’s Managing Director, Mark Chilcote, said the fact battery manufacturing is still a burgeoning industry in Australia will make it something of an exercise in skills transfer. “Anyone currently operating a chemical plant or a gas plant could be reskilled [for Renaissance One],” Chilcote said. “There’ll be a lot of work for chemists and scientists, engineers, plenty of opportunities for graduates and interns.”
The initial production capacity of Renaissance One will be 66 MWh per annum, and the company expects to export more than half of its output through the Port of Newcastle.

The minister himself is also planning to do just that: revealing the key priorities of his recently announced 10 year energy plan for the state.
Speaking at the virtual Queensland Smart Energy Summit hosted by the Smart Energy Council, de Brenni also revealed some of the key findings of a recent survey commissioned by his government. With almost 4,500 respondents, de Brenni described it as “the biggest survey of its kind”. The key takeaways include that among respondents surveyed, the number with home batteries had doubled. “It’s terrific to see the uptake of household battery systems reducing grid reliance and of course slashing bills,” he said. The minister did not, however, clarify the time frame of this doubling.
The second key takeaway from the survey, the minister said, was that the cost of electricity is of significantly less concern to Queenslanders today than it was five years ago. “In fact, the figures show 45% of us are less worried about our bills then we were in 2015. And we’ve got every right to feel that way because the average quarterly bill has been going down year on year for the last three years,” de Brenni said.

Both these shifts happened against the backdrop of a still-increasing thirst for solar PV in the state, despite the fact Queensland already has the world’s highest rate of households fitted with solar per capita, the minister said. The survey’s full results are expected to be delivered later this week.
Its key findings led the minister to urge those at the virtual energy summit, no doubt primarily members of the clean energy sector, to make the most of momentum. “We are seeing huge potential for the energy sector to capitalise in growing interest in cleaner energy amongst consumers,” de Brenni said. “We should act quickly to leverage and respond to this feedback.”
“Building on this positive sentiment right now is the key to future of success,” he added.
Just a few weeks ago, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced she had commissioned de Brenni, her energy minister, to deliver a 10 year energy plan for the state. For the minister, the primary task of the plan is to ensure Queensland finally begins using its assets to their full potential.
“I think the key to the energy plan is to make sure we don’t repeat, that our nation does not repeat, the mistakes we made in the previous century when we decided we would be an exporter of things and allow all the other nations to do the value adding to then purchase it back,” de Brenni said.
In other words, he wants to see the “re-industrialisation of our nation”. “I think Australians are yearning for it,” he added, “the opportunity is right here.”
For example, the minister wants to see Queensland not just mining the metals and minerals used in batteries, but producing the batteries themselves. De Brenni also expressed his dismay at the current lead times for purchasing electrolysers to make green hydrogen, which are around 12 months. We can’t have such delays, the minister expressed, if we want to become a global hydrogen leader.
De Brenni also said he wants to see more manufacturing of solar panels come onshore, as well as wind industry manufacturing. “We’ve got to crack that nut and bring that manufacturing here,” he added.
Alongside that objective, de Brenni said the plan would naturally focus on addressing the biggest challenge of renewable integration: reliability, while also ensuring constant affordability for citizens.
Great to hear from @MickdeBrenni that electric vehicles will play a crucial role in the energy plan.

De Brenni, a frequent face at renewable energy events and one of Australia’s most vocal proponents of green hydrogen, said his plan would focus on the integration of green hydrogen into the heavy transport sector, as well as electric vehicle policy. He lamented that Australians are currently filling their cars with fossil fuels profiting exporters in the middle east when they could instead be fuelling them with green electricity from Queensland itself.
“Critically important to the success of the energy plan is to make sure that it outlines a credible pathway to meeting our renewable energy target by 2030 but then also sets out how we will continue to build on that industrial agenda through to 2050. We’ve set a net-zero emissions target for 2050 and we intend to get there through the initiatives outlined in our energy plan.”
The minister said the next few months involve extensive consultations with industry to develop the plan. De Brenni also urged industry to discuss with the department how to best use the competitive advantage of having some of the Asia pacific regions cheapest electricity to drive value adding businesses in the state.
John Grimes, CEO of the Smart Energy Council, congratulated the minister on the plan. “We’ve got a Queensland government that understands the massive economic opportunity,” Grimes said.
The Queensland government also announced today that it had joined the Smart Energy Council’s Zero Carbon Certification Scheme, aimed at guaranteeing the origin of green hydrogen produced in Australia.
“The Queensland Government set a new benchmark last month with the establishment of a $2 billion renewable and hydrogen fund to supercharge jobs. It is all about development of Queensland’s resources sector while at the same time delivering on its renewables commitments. It’s fantastic to have them on board,” Grimes said of the announcement.

A new CAES system from South Africa-based Leaper Innovate Green Energies (LIGE), and introduced to Australia by Queensland-based Essential Water and Energy Services, is unlocking CAES’s potential as a scaleable energy storage system for clean intermittent sources with a long-lifespan and low-cost. 
CAES is not a new technology of course, the first system (290 MW) was installed at Huntorf, Germany, in 1978 and is still in operation today. In 1988, the Alabama Electric Cooperative’s 110 MW CAES plant also began operations in North America. CAES seems has become a more feasible solution in the last year and several large-scale projects have been announced in the United States, Israel and Canada.
The LIGE is a zero-emissions Air Battery that can be linked to the grid or a renewable energy source to provide clean energy and even clean water. According to Essential Water and Energy Services’s managing director, Geoff Hill, “a 1 MW air battery can produce up to 5,000 litres of water a day in humid conditions. The amount of water produced varies depending on the humidity of the air, also no rare earth metals are used and all parts can be recycled.”That 1 MW system can be housed in a single 12 metre container and would require a 225 kW solar system to recharge 1 MWh of stored energy. 


With a 30 year lifespan and a range between 40 kWh and 50 MWh in either 3 phase 380 VAC 700A or 750 VDC 500A, LIGE Air Batteries are now being manufactured under licence in Australia. 
“All major regions in the world have access to respective underground geological resources,” said Christian Breyer, professor of solar economy at the Lappeenranta University of Technology in Finland, “but there are also vast regions without a suitable potential, at least according to our analysis.” 
Breyer’s recent study of CAES with fellow researcher Arman Aghahosseini found that the storage technology is best suited to countries and regions that have little or no interconnection with their neighbours. “The more nationally a highly renewable energy system is designed,” Breyer told pv magazine, “the more relevant CAES becomes.” 
Breyer believes that CAES may become crucial in the weekly storage zone, rather than as a mainstream or seasonal storage solution. And although the study found that North America (particularly Western Canada) and Sub-Saharan Africa were the best suited regions for CAES, Australia also has a decent spread of the right geological conditions (see below image). 

Hill says the increasing need for scalable energy storage systems in the energy transition means that CAES and particularly the LIGE technology “may challenge Lithium-ion’s dominant energy storage position.”

China’s National Photovoltaic and Energy Demonstration Experimental Centre has begun testing vanadium redox flow batteries at its Daqing facility in northeastern China.
The announcement was made by Toronto-based Sparton Resources Inc., a minority shareholder in Canadian vanadium redox battery provider VRB Energy, which will provide a 125 kW/500 kWh storage unit for testing.
“The unit will be installed at the Centre and used as an evaluation and demonstration unit to assist in developing the Peoples Republic of China’s industrial energy storage policies and technical standards as part of the nation’s commitment to carbon neutrality,” Sparton said in a statement. “The Centre and the battery system are scheduled to be completed and fully functional by September 26th, 2021.”
VRB Energy, which is majority-owned by Vancouver-based metals exploration company High Power Exploration Inc. (HPX), unveiled in March a plan to build a gigafactory for the production of vanadium redox flow batteries in China. The agreement includes the setting up of an R&D facility and the development and construction of a 100 MW solar plant linked to a 100 MW/500 MWh vanadium flow battery in Xiangyang.
VRB Energy claims its vanadium redox flow storage systems rely on low-cost ion-exchange membrane and bipole material, and long-life electrolyte formulation. The standard battery power module is rated at 250 kW for megawatt-class systems

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/20/serial-inventor-aims-to-change-pv-value-chain-by-addressing-heat/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JULY 20, 2021",Serial inventor aims to change PV value chain by addressing heat,"From pv magazine USA
It happens every day: A bird flies over your rooftop solar panel array and deposits an unwelcome offering on a cell. The bird dropping is an annoyance that needs to be cleaned off. But it also can result in a hot spot on the affected cell, impacting the entire panel’s output and potentially affecting its long-term performance.
The phenomenon is known as reverse bias and the hot spot that is its hallmark is something of an Achilles’ heel for the solar industry. That’s because a single cell weakened by a bird dropping or a leaf shadow can be overpowered by stronger cells that surround it. Those neighbouring cells send a reverse flow through the weaker cell, causing it to experience temperatures that can exceed 400 F (204.4 C) and operate at voltages in excess of 20 times those of forward voltages.
All of that leads to cell stress, premature ageing, and the increased likelihood of a module’s total failure.
A serial inventor, Kent Kernahan, first began to tackle the problem more than a decade ago. His solution was to design a control technology that detects reverse bias and redirects current away from the affected cell and through the rest of the otherwise healthy solar panel. He went on to create a company, IdealPV, to develop the technology.
And here’s where things get even more interesting: He also established a business model that could help disadvantaged communities all across the United States, by making the technology available to non-profit entities set up under Section 501(c)3 of the U.S. tax code. The first such nonprofit to start manufacturing IdealPV solar cells is now getting underway in California. More on that in a bit.
Call for help
At its core, the control technology that Kernahan developed watches for a signal that the weakened cell sends out as it begins to overheat. The control system uses that signal to throttle back the affected cell, redirect current across the panel, and ease the onset of a reverse bias event.
“The breakthrough allows us to anticipate reverse bias” and act to alleviate the emerging hot spot, Kernahan told pv magazine in a recent interview.
IdealPV’s solar panel technology is based on what Kernahan refers to as the Law of Forward Only Zero Hot Spot (FOZHS). Derived from the First Law of Thermodynamics and the Law of the Photoelectric effect, FOZHS lays out that the conductance of a solar cell falls as its voltage becomes more negative. The company’s solar panels make practical use of this insight to keep the conductance of each solar cell high and prevent any of them from being subjected to the reverse (negative) voltage that drives extreme heat into the cell.
In and of itself, that’s a useful advancement in cell design. But Kernahan sees broader implications for his innovation across the cell manufacturing value chain. Because most modules are designed to manage wide variations in temperatures across very small intervals, everything from glass to adhesion and backsheeting is designed to handle temperature extremes.
By addressing reverse bias and the resulting heat, Kernahan and IdealPV moved to unwind and rethink the entire module manufacturing process. For example, without the need of bypass diodes and busbars, it becomes practical to put more, shorter cells in series. This reduces internal cell and panel currents and increases internal panel voltage. In turn, this allows for cells with corner chips, local AR defects, and cracks to be used. Such cells typically are a fraction the cost of cells without defects.
The ability to remove heat-related design parameters “dumbs down the manufacturing requirements,” Kerhahan said, making for a “very forgiving manufacturing process.”
And that opens the door for what Kernahan and others hope will be a nationwide network of nonprofit solar module manufacturing facilities. By making use of provisions within the U.S. tax code, a group known as Community Home Energy Retrofit Project (CHERP) is working with individual and corporate investors whose focus is not on shareholder returns and maximising profits, but on an underlying social mission to work in disadvantaged communities and expand solar’s adoption among low- and moderate-income people.
The first factory dedicated to IdealPV solar cell production opened in Claremont, California, earlier this year. Made possible in part by US$2.1 million (AU$2.8 million) from the California state budget, the factory is waiting on certifications for its solar panel from the National Testing Laboratories. Once those certifications are in hand, CHERP will start to hire with a goal of producing its first modules later this year.
The factory will create around 200 jobs, with entry-level warehouse and installation workers paid between US$16 and US$20 (AU$21 – $28) per hour. Each panel produces around 330 kWh a year through its expected 25-year production life. Each will cost about US$160 (AU$220) to build  and take around 45 minutes to assemble. The plant will be able to produce up to 105,000 panels a year or enough for about 6,000 typical Southern California households. The switch to solar is projected to save those residents a combined US$6.5 million (AU$8.8 million) in energy costs yearly.
Once the first facility is up and running, the plan is to replicate the template nationwide and help other community-based nonprofit groups to create manufacturing jobs and deploy solar. Talks are under way with a substance abuse recovery facility in West Virginia, a green sustainability initiative in Michigan, and a gang rehabilitation and re-entry program in Los Angeles.
The initial goal of taking the heat out of solar panels could lead to the emergence of a non-profit-based solar manufacturing sector, Kernahan said. “We want to bring back middle-class employment and manufacturing,” he added.

Solar project developers in Europe will have taken note as more details emerged about two crucial policy developments related to the EU’s desire to apply its European Green Deal principles to the energy sector.
The European commissioner for economy, Paolo Gentiloni, on Thursday held a press conference about the EU’s proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) – which would levy charges on non-EU products in relation to their embedded carbon footprint – and about a planned revision of the taxes applied to energy generation.
Commissioner Gentiloni said the long-trailed CBAM would initially require importers of goods into the EU to report on the embedded carbon footprint of the products in question, from 2023-25, without having to pay any associated cost. Importers would, however, have to purchase certificates to offset the carbon represented by the imported goods from 2026 onwards, under the European Commission proposal, with the weekly prices of the carbon allowances set by a beefed-up EU emissions trading scheme.
The commissioner dismissed claims the CBAM would amount to protectionism by indicating the regime would be specifically linked to individual imported goods rather than to their countries of origin.
The former Italian prime minister also outlined the planned changes to the bloc’s Energy Tax Directive, the rates of which, he said, have been unchanged since 2003.
Commenting on the fact electricity is taxed by volume, without regard to the sustainability or otherwise of the power or the fuel used, Commissioner Gentiloni said the rates “do not reflect the actual energy content or environmental performance of the energy sources covered. They lead to pollutant fuels being taxed less than their cleaner alternatives, which of course makes no sense. In short, the current rules are completely out of synch with our green ambitions.”
Under the proposed reform of the directive, a new tax regime would set minimum taxation rates for different types of electricity generation and fuel use, reflecting environmental performance and energy efficiency. It would then be down to EU member states to tax the most environmentally harmful fuels the most, said Gentiloni, with exemptions to the minimum rates only available to the most sustainable sources of energy.
The new regime would list more energy products and uses which have emerged since 2003 and the commissioner said the mandatory exemption from taxation of kerosene in aviation, and of oil used in shipping, would be lifted, with sustainable alternatives in both sectors to instead be exempted from tax for ten years.
Gentiloni said the proposed taxation reform would give member states “in-built possibilities” to mitigate any resulting rise in costs for lower-income households.
