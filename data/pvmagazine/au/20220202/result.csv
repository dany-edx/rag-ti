The Philippines’ Department of Energy has launched an auction to allocate 2 GW of renewable energy capacity.
Through the procurement exercise, the country’s authorities want to contract 1,260 MW of PV, 380 MW of wind power, 230 MW of biomass, and 130 MW of hydropower capacity.
As for the PV technology, around 900 MW should be assigned to the Luzon province, while the provinces of Visayas and Mindanao are expected to be awarded 260 and 100 MW, respectively.
The Philippines has an installed power generation capacity of around 20 GW, with 14.3 GW of it in the Luzon area, where the largest of the country’s three grids is located. The next two largest networks are in Visayas and Mindanao.
The Philippines government announced the plan to introduce the Green Energy Tariff Program auction in February 2020.
The auction will feature a maximum price for the renewable electricity generated by tendered projects and the program will be administered by the Philippines Department of Energy, according to a report published by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). Off-grid electrification projects will be included in the proposed tender system, the research institute added.
The country plans to install 15 GW of clean energy by 2030. Recent statistics released by the International Renewable Energy Agency show that the Philippines had an installed PV capacity of 1.04GW – driven by the country’s renewable energy law – at the end of 2020. Most of the nation’s solar facilities were secured under the old feed-in tariff regime, auctions, and net metering programs.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/02/australian-researchers-claim-solar-cell-efficiency-record/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,SOUTH KOREA,SWITZERLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 2, 2022",Australian researchers claim solar cell efficiency record,"A team of researchers at the Australian National University say they have broken their own record for most efficient perovskite solar cell in one centimetre squared, reaching 22.6%. However, little over a week ago a group of scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) achieved an efficiency of 25.7% on a perovskite solar cell. While that efficiency dropped to 23.3% when the surface of the solar cells was increased to 1cm2, the Swiss cell still appears to be able to convert more efficient.
The Australian National University (ANU) team published their study in Nature on January 26, highlighting in the paper’s title that their cell had a “fill factor,” a measure of the cell’s quality, of more than 86%.
Alongside this high fill factor, the team, led by Dr Jun Peng, say they reached the improved cell efficiency level after opting to use standard fabrication techniques applied to a new material, titanium oxynitride. The team also detected energy loss in one of the layers of their earlier perovskite solar cell designs, an issue they fixed prompting an efficiency boost.
ANU says its new cells are not only able to convert more light to electricity, but are also easier to manufacture – noting affordability as crucial for commercialisation. 
Perovskites are a family of materials with a specific crystal structure and have shown potential for high efficiency and low production costs when used for solar cells. Though scientists have been able to reach high cell efficiencies using perovskite materials, the specific mechanisms allowing for these is not fully understood, with research to date showing what is going on inside the material is quite to different to crystalline silicon and other common PV cell materials.
Moreover, perovskite solar cells have proven unstable when scaled up to mass production, leading to various defects, and the high efficiencies achieved in laboratories cannot be easily reproduced when transferred to production lines.
Less than a week before the ANU study was published in Nature, the journal Science published a paper on quantum dots being used in perovskite solar cells to achieve a power conversion efficiency of more than 25% alongside high operational stability. 
A group of scientists led by Michael Graetzel from the the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) and Dong Suk Kim from the Korea Institute of Energy Research explained in the study that the titanium dioxide electron transport layer of the perovskite cells had been replaced by a thin layer of tin (IV) oxide quantum dots stabilised with polyacrylic acid. This improved the light-trapping capacity of the cells while suppressing non-radiative recombination, which has hitherto hampered efficiency, wrote Sandra Enkhardt for pv magazine Germany.
With the layer of quantum dots, higher efficiencies could also be transferred to larger cell formats, with the team reporting efficiencies of 23.3%, 21.7% and 20.6% when the surface of the solar cells was increased to 1, 20 and 64 square centimetres.
Whichever research institute holds the record, there can be no doubt there is massive interest in realising the promises of perovskite solar cells among the global science community. Onwards and upwards!

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/02/shell-completes-powershop-takeover-despite-widespread-outrage/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 2, 2022",Shell completes Powershop takeover despite widespread outrage,"The outcry following the revelation that oil and gas giant Shell would be purchasing Australia’s ‘greenest’ power company revealed a sizeable shift in Australia’s cognisance of greenwashing and corporate responsibility.
In the month after the takeover was announced, the ABC (Australian National Corporation) gathered data to estimate Powershop had lost 6,000 of its 185,000 customers across New South Wales (NSW), Victoria, South Australia, and Queensland.
Social media raged with the news that a fossil fuel giant would take over the company which Greenpeace ranked first in its Green Electricity Guide published in 2018. Activism group GetUp ran a campaign on the corporate takeover, encouraging customers to switch providers – a call which seems to have been heeded with minor “green electricity” retailers reporting spikes in new customers over the last three months.
GetUp!
As of February 1, Shell’s takeover of Powershop Australia was completed nonetheless, clearing the final regulatory steps. The company will now operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell under the Powershop brand within the Shell Energy business in Australia, which is part of Shell’s global Renewables and Energy Solutions business.
Shell bought the business after teaming up with Australian investment manager Infrastructure Capital Group (ICG) to take over Powershop’s partner company, Meridian Energy Australia (MEA), a subsidiary of New Zealand-based company Meridian Energy.
The price Shell paid for Powershop, and its certified clean and green credentials, remains undisclosed, though the acquisition was reportedly part of a $729 million asset sale by Meridian.

In 2021, photovoltaic systems with a combined capacity of 183 GW were installed worldwide — almost 40 GW more than in 2020, Bloomberg New Energy Finance (NEF) reports.
As a result of this strong growth, the analyst has revised upwards its outlook for 2022, expecting new systems may total between 204 and 252 GW. Considering any possible scenario, the mark of 200 GW should be broken through for the first time this year.
China will drive demand and rooftop PV will be the fastest-growing segment. Record growth of 20 GW will be achieved by residential installations. Commercial and industrial systems will also see their share increase, as these are becoming more and more profitable against the background of rising electricity prices and electricity shortages in the country. Overall, the BloombergNEF analysts are expecting an increase in new capacity of between 81 and 92 GW this year in China.
The analyst also expects current high module prices will drop soon. In 2021, polysilicon shortage drove the prices for 166 mm monocrystalline solar modules up to $0.278 per watt. For this year, polysilicon production will increase by 39% as new manufacturing facilities are coming online in China. The price of polysilicon has been falling again since October – from $37 to $32 per kg by the end of the year. This trend will continue and prices of between $20 and $25 per kg can be expected in the second half of the year. Increasing efficiency in the production of large wafers with a size of 210 mm will further contribute to further reducing module prices. For the second half of the year, BNEF predicts that the module price will be between 11 and 15% lower, reaching $23/24 per watt.
Overall, BNEF assumes that production capacities will increase along the entire photovoltaic value chain. New cell factories with an annual capacity of more than 10 GW for TOPCon and heterojunction products are currently being built. Furthermore, the analyst revealed that annual production capacity for PERC solar cells was more than 400 GW at the end of the year.
New production capacities for solar cells and solar modules are also increasing outside of China. This is particularly evident in India, the US and Europe. However, the new production lines are emerging rather slowly and the BNEF analysts do not assume that there will be a sharp increase in the amount of products manufactured outside of China this year. Manufacturers in India, the US and Europe must be aware that they are expanding into an oversupply market where there is guaranteed demand for their photovoltaic products at premium prices, the analysts said.
BloombergNEF also expects the number of solar-plus-storage power plants to double this year. According to the BNEF database, a total of 278 of these power plants with a combined storage capacity of 7.7 GW is currently operational, with China and the US leading the way.
The demand for rooftop solar arrays combined with residential storage systems is increasingly on the political agenda in many countries and is becoming increasingly important as a sector, the analyst continues. In the US state of Hawaii, for example, almost every new residential PV system is combined with a battery. In Germany, the rate is around 50% and in Switzerland around 5%. BNEF expects at least two more countries to surpass the 50% mark in new installations by the end of the year.
In Europe, Bloomberg analysts expect a significant increase in the number of power purchase agreements (PPAs) concluded for photovoltaic systems. They name Poland, Denmark and Germany as countries in which such agreements will increasingly be sealed this year. This is also to be expected in Spain once the political uncertainties have been resolved.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/02/australian-zinc-bromide-batteries-chosen-for-accionas-spanish-testing-field/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SPAIN",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 2, 2022",Australian zinc-bromide batteries chosen for Acciona’s Spanish testing field,"Spanish renewable energy company Acciona Energía will test the zinc-bromide battery technology developed by Sydney-based company Gelion Technologies at its photovoltaic testing plant in Navarra.
The project is part of the I’mnovation program, which Acciona Energy launched to assess emerging energy storage solutions through collaborations with companies from around the world.
Ten energy storage companies participated in the program and four were selected to test their technologies at Acciona’s facilities, including Gelion. The selected startups will have the opportunity to test their technologies for six months to one year at the 1.2 MW Montes del Cierzo experimental photovoltaic plant at Tudela, Navarra, starting in July 2022.
If the tests with Acciona Energía are successful, Gelion’s Endure battery will form part of the European company’s supplier portfolio as a renewable energy storage provider.
Gelion Technologies
Gelion is currently in the process of commercialising its zinc-bromide Endure batteries, going public on the London AIM market last year to access capital to accelerate the journey.
In 2021, Gelion pivoted its battery design to a parallel plate lead-acid format to leverage existing battery manufacturing capabilities in Australia, as well as access supply chains as the lead-acid format’s traditional applications wane.
The company’s founder, University of Sydney chemistry professor Thomas Maschmeyer, says the zinc-bromide chemistry and Gelion design has significant advantages over lithium chemistries, particularly with regards to safety. 
The company’s electrolyte gel is a fire retardant, meaning its batteries can’t catch fire or explode. They can operate safely at temperatures up to 50°C and can be completely discharged to zero volts with no loss of function, making them “very abuse tolerant”, according to Maschmeyer.
Gelion Technologies
Traditionally, zinc-bromide chemistries have been implemented as flow batteries, which is the path Brisbane-based company Redflow is taking. However, Maschmeyer says the flow battery format has operational and commercial challenges since they can be costly and complex to produce. Thus Gelion’s recent pivot, which it estimates will save millions due to manufacturing ease.
Gelion is targeting a commercial product cost for its Endure batteries of just $100 (USD 68) per kWh, which is remarkably competitive. Obviously, since cost is hugely dependent on volume, the company’s strategy is to tolerate a loss in its first few years while production scales up.
Being selected by Acciona Energía for commercial trialling in Spain will obviously help this process, with professor Maschmeyer describing zinc-bromide chemistry as ideal for solar batteries as it’s relatively slow to charge.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/02/natural-hydrogen-exploration-boom-sees-one-third-of-south-australia-snapped-up/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 2, 2022",Natural hydrogen exploration ‘boom’ snaps up one third of South Australia,"In a rapid escalation from zero activity in February last year, exploration companies are now scrambling to look for what they believe could be the cheapest, easiest way to get their hands on the much hyped “future fuel”: hydrogen.
In the last 12 months, six different companies have either been granted or applied for 18 Petroleum Exploration Licences across the state of South Australia, according to Australian energy consultancy EnergyQuest. Combined, the area under permit equates to around 570,000 square kilometres (km2) or 32% of the entire state, the consultancy has found, referring to the sudden influx as a “boom”.
Until now, natural or native hydrogen has been largely overlooked – despite it being described as “widespread in nature” by natural hydrogen researcher Viacheslav Zgonnik in a 2020 paper. Natural hydrogen deposits form through chemical reactions underground, with Zgonnik saying the molecule has been detected at high concentrations, often as the major gas, in all types of geologic environments. 
Nonetheless, natural hydrogen has garnered relatively little interest – even as recent years have seen enthusiasm for the molecule skyrocket with a thousands of companies announcing a plethora of means to produce it.
Gold Hydrogen
The renewed interest in these underground cavities filled with hydrogen came, according to EnergyQuest, from the “chance rediscovery” of historical reports of two wells drilled in the 1930s where high purity hydrogen was detected.
The company which now owns the exploration rights to the area where this high-purity hydrogen was detected is Brisbane-based firm Gold Hydrogen. It has been granted the right to explore approximately 9,500km2 near Adelaide, specifically the southern part of the Yorke Peninsula through to Kangaroo Island.
According to Gold Hydrogen, its exploration licence 687, which was last year expanded by the state government to include hydrogen, was granted after director Luke Titus provided evidence of discoveries of flowing natural hydrogen with contents of up to 90% purity. Follow up testing near the discoveries have been independently verified and audited, the company says, adding that its rights permit it to begin undertaking further exploration testing from 2022.
Gold Hydrogen’s aim is to be the the first in Australia to produce, use and sell natural hydrogen which it described as an “inexhaustible source of green energy.” 
Why it is calling the source, which would essentially be mined, “inexhaustible” is because it is believed the chemical reaction that leads to underground hydrogen deposits continually regenerates, though it is also critical to note that technical and scientific knowledge of natural hydrogen reservoirs is limited.
H2EX/LinkedIn
That said, in March last year the CSIRO published a paper entitled ‘Hydrogen in Australian natural gas: occurrences, sources and resources’ in which the Commonwealth scientific research agency considered natural hydrogen, updating the “scarce reporting of hydrogen in Australian natural gas”.
There has also been considerable interest in storing hydrogen in salt caverns and other underground formations. It appears natural hydrogen uses these principles without human intervention. 
Despite the lack of research, Australian – and indeed a number of companies internationally – remain undeterred, likely because of the potential for natural hydrogen to be three to four times cheaper than that produced via electrolysis or gas reforming with carbon capture. Gold Hydrogen estimates it should be able to produce natural hydrogen for less than $2.30 per kg, compared to manufactured hydrogen projects being produced at greater than $6 per kg.
Importantly, it seems natural hydrogen would still carry the label “green”, though again it may be too early to say.
To date, the only major discovery and implementation of natural hydrogen reservoirs has been in Mali in west Africa. In 2012, natural hydrogen was discovered and eventually connected to a fuel cell to supply electricity to the town of Bourabougu. 
Canadian company Hydroma, behind the project, is now preparing to produce and export its natural hydrogen.
