The factory, once built, will be the world’s largest with an initial capacity capable of manufacturing up to 2 GW of electrolysers annually. 
Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest, FFI’s chairman, said he expects the Global Green Energy (GEM) manufacturing centre, as it’s called, to enter production of its first electrolysers in 2023. The plant, which is expected to require a $114 million investment initially, will use U.S. company Plug Power’s electrolyser and fuel cell technology as part of a joint venture the two companies announced last month.
“Receiving planning approval from the state government brings this project even closer to fruition, as we work towards commencing construction on the first stage in February 2022,” FFI’s CEO Julie Shuttleworth said.
Gladstone, located on Queensland’s midcoast, is seeking to become a major hydrogen hub, with Queensland’s Deputy Premier and Minister for State Development, Steven Miles, saying FFI’s factory will boost these growing credentials. “It will be the first facility in Australia able to make the multi-gigawatt-scale electrolysers used worldwide in hydrogen production,” Miles said.
“The facility will be constructed within a four-hectare site with an electrolyser assembly building to cover approximately 12,900 square metres,” he added.
The Gladstone Global Green Energy factory sits alongside FFI’s plan to also built a 1 GW solar PV module manufacturing plant, though the intended location of that facility is not yet clear. That plan, also revealed in October, followed FFI’s purchase of a 60% stake in Netherlands-based renewable energy specialists High yield Energy Technologies Group.

While precisely how aircrafts themselves will reduce their emissions remains unclear, airports are heaping to solar to meet the 2030 net zero targets over 100 global airports have already committed to.
Some of the ideas being floated include solar runways as well as introducing solar pavements in the “dead zones” between where aircrafts park at the gates. Both “gimmicks” in the sense such projects are conceptual and still a long way from reality, Ken Conway from aviation consulting company Airbiz said there are far more grounded ways airports are looking to integrate solar today.
Speaking at Smart Aviation Asia Pacific’s event on Tuesday, Conway pointed out instead of a solar runway, which is fairly questionable in terms of strength needed to cope with the dynamic load of landing planes, it’s far more likely solar could be installed on the shoulders, or edges, of runways. For a runway 7.5 metres wide and 3,500 metres long, Conway calculates roughly 50,000 square metres could potentially be used to install solar, which could in turn power lighting systems or other airport operations. “This is where thinking is now starting to ideate itself going forward,” he said.
While Conway described solar pavements in airport dead zones as “star gazing”, he said that introducing solar on top of terminal gates is already a reality. Airports, he added, are now looking at opportunities to introduce green autonomous ramps.
In his course of work, Conway’s now starting to see see airports co-locate 20 MW+ onsite ground solar arrays integrated with “major” battery storage systems which can alone deliver between 30% to 35% of the airport’s electricity demand annually.
In terms of Australian airports, Melbourne has the largest operational solar system with 12.4 MW(DC) of ground mounted solar and 1.8 MW on its rooftop, totally 14.2 MW of capacity. The Melbourne system last year outstripped the previous record holder, Brisbane airport, which has 6 MW of solar, 5 MW of which is installed on its rooftops, while 1 MW is ground mounted.
Speaking at the same event, Dhwaraknath Nagarajan, the electrical project manager at Brisbane Airport, said the Queensland solar array, which is spread over five locations at the airport, has saved both significant amounts of money and carbon emissions in the two plus years it’s been operating. “With solar we were able to defer capital expenditure on what we call the high voltage infrastructure that is required to run the airport electricity network. So we were able to defer $20 to $50 million because the peak load demand was managed by our solar system,” Nagarajan said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/17/australia-welcomes-first-energy-data-one-stop-shop/,"HIGHLIGHTS,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 17, 2021",Australia welcomes first energy data ‘one stop shop’,"The Victoria-based Centre for New Energy Technologies, or C4NET, has been providing detailed energy data to universities, governments and other research institutes for years, and has now decided to expand its scope. The centre’s CEO James Seymour said C4NET is keen to tackle some of “those hairy, complex questions” by digging deep into its trove of data and offering those insights to interested parties Australia-wide. 
Collaborating with Victorian electricity distribution networks, C4NET’s new Data Access Service is a first of its kind. It will provide data collected from Victoria’s 2.8 million smart meters (while of course adhering to data use and privacy requirements) including aggregated consumption data, information about the penetration of various localised renewable energy sources and certain network operational information.
While the data C4NET uses comes from Victoria, Seymour said it can offer valuable insights nationwide. Seymour also said the centre is keen to aggregate its datasets with those from other sources, including, for instance, that gathered by inverters and other renewable analysts. “We welcome others to come and join us,” Seymour told pv magazine Australia, adding that the centre could help new players adhere to strict privacy rules given C4NET is something of an expert in data regulation space now.
C4NET
A big part of what C4NET does, Seymour said, is figure out what data parties actually need – which is often not the dataset they’ve asked for. This is hardly surprising given Victoria alone has five different distribution zones, meaning data-seeking groups often hit hurdles straight out of the gates just figuring out who to ask. “This is complex, no single partner can do this by themselves,”Seymour said.
What C4NET does then is look at what the query is trying to achieve and finds the most useful data to illuminate the issue. 
Not a commercial enterprise (C4NET is funded by its members which include Victoria’s distribution networks along with a number of universities. Its new Data Access Service has been enabled by a grant from the Victorian government though), C4NET digs out data and fits it into a regulatory standard and for the services charges a cost recovery fee. That is, the centre estimates how difficult it will be to track down and analyse the data required, and asks customers to pay not for the data itself but only for the hours its data analysts spend on the task.
Given over 99% of houses in Victoria are fitted with smart meters, many of which have been installed for well over five years, the amount of data C4NET has at its fingertips isn’t to be snuffed at. In terms of granularity, Seymour says much can be dug from this trove. “For most purposes, 30 minute data provides good insight,” he told pv magazine, referring to the 30 minute settlement system which in October was replaced with a five minute settlement system, increasing insights six fold. “[This] would then give you the vast majority,” Seymour added.
There are of course some things for which smart meters data is insufficient, like looking at frequency issues, but Seymour says the cost of tracking and storing such granular data would be enormous especially since the necessity for such tracking is fairly niche.
Data sourced through C4NET gave rise to the recent insight that buildings in the City of Melbourne could provide 74% of their own electricity needs if solar technology is fully integrated into roofs, walls and windows. The Monash University-based ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science together with collaborators at the University of Lisbon conducted the research, sourcing its data from C4NET.
The centre has also helped the Australian Building Codes Board compare the real life differences of five and six star rated buildings compared with older houses; it’s helped local councils verify greenhouse gas reporting in its municipalities; as well as collating data for the Victorian government to understand how its residents use their rooftop solar.
“I’ve been surprised by some of the queries,” Seymour said.
The bottom line is the new data “one stop shop” is now open to queries from anybody and is keen to collaborate with parties with data to share and a desire to accelerate Australia’s decarbonisation. “You need really detailed coordination and organisation,” Seymour said. He hopes C4NET can offer Australia just that, with his ultimate goal being to provide insights which can go on to inform better policy choices.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/17/redox-flow-battery-with-capacity-retention-of-99-98-per-cycle/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 17, 2021",Redox flow battery with capacity retention of 99.98% per cycle,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists from the South China University of Technology have built an aqueous redox flow battery with a positive electrolyte made of the electroactive organic molecule called TEMPO, which they describe as a chemical compound with easily reversed oxidation states and a high potential for energy.
Also known by the formula (CH2)3(CMe2)2NO, TEMPO is a well-known electroactive aminoxyl radical used in several applications by organic chemists, polymer scientists and molecular biologists. It consists of a bright orange solid that has a stable free radical nature and can be stored for years.
“However, TEMPO cannot be directly applied to aqueous redox flow batteries due to the high hydrophobicity of the molecular skeleton,” the research team said, adding that, when it is left unmodified, it is unable to dissolve in the liquid needed to facilitate the energy exchange in flow batteries. “We developed a strategy to functionalise TEMPO with viologen, an organic compound that has highly reversible redox reactions, to improve TEMPO’s hydrophilicity.”
The TEMPO derivative the scientists developed is claimed to promote the battery’s aqueous solubility, as viologen is highly water-soluble, and also to increase redox potential due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of viologen itself.
Furthermore, viologen’s densely positive charge minimizes so-called “crossover.” This phenomenon, which can cause capacity losses that can reach up to 50%, occurs during charging and recharging, when battery electrolyte components cross the membrane in the battery cell and the redoxmers – which are redox-active molecules that can store energy in the batteries’ electrolytes – migrate to the wrong side of the device.
Moreover, the salt nature of viologen endows TEMPO with a decent conductivity in an aqueous solution, the Chinese group explained.
The viologen-modified TEMPO was tested in an aqueous redox flow battery and was found to help the device retain a capacity of 99.98% per cycle, which they describe as sufficient to make the battery hold nearly all its stored energy when not in active use.
“This work overcomes the disadvantages of TEMPO by viologen-functionalization and realises its application in aqueous redox flow battery,” said the research corresponding author, Zhenxing Liang. “The molecular design concept provides a strategy for novel organic electroactive materials and lays a foundation for the application of [an] aqueous organic flow battery.”
The process to synthesise a molecular compound that serves as a low-cost electrolyte for the battery is described in the paper Viologen-Decorated TEMPO for Neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries, published in Energy Material Advances.

Bidders who failed to win projects under the Indian government’s production-linked incentives scheme for solar manufacturing still stand a chance to secure funding, because the authorities are providing US$3.2 billion (AU$4.3 billion) of additional funding for the subsidy program.
Power Minister RK Singh recently told the PTI news agency that the government has approved the ministry’s proposal to expand funding. The additional funds will help more manufacturers under the incentives scheme, paving the way for India to become a solar panel manufacturing hub and exporter.
Jindal India Solar, Shirdi Sai Electricals and Reliance New Energy Solar have already secured funds under the incentives scheme to support gigawatt-scale production of high-efficiency solar modules. Other companies – including Adani Infrastructure, First Solar, Coal India, Larsen & Toubro, Renew Solar, Tata Power, and Waaree Energies – are on the waiting list to obtain similar support. The waiting list will be valid for six months after the announcement of successful bids.
Singh said that at present, India has a solar module production capacity of 8.8 GW and cell capacity of 2.5 GW. The incentives scheme tender drew bids for 54.5 GW of solar equipment production capacity.
