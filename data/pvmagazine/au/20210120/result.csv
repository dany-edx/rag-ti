With the federal government characteristically thumb twiddling, Australia’s Smart Energy Council (SEC) are forging ahead with its Zero Carbon Certification Scheme to provide both domestic and international customers a Guarantee of Origin for hydrogen, ammonia and other derivative products. 
Getting the scheme rolled out is a matter of urgency, Scott Hamilton, who sits on the Strategic Advisory Panel for the Australian-German Energy Transition Hub and is working with SEC to develop the scheme, told pv magazine Australia. The wave of green hydrogen is (finally) cresting – “either Australia is going to pull off the back, and other countries are going to pick up and run with it, or we’re going to ride this wave,” he said.
After announcing its plans for the scheme in December, SEC promptly signed an agreement with German peak body, dena, solidifying its vision of developing a scheme that not only delivers the goods for Australian industries but preemptively caters to its soon-to-be international green hydrogen customers. Germany, it seems, is just the first in the SEC line up. “There are active negotiations with a number of parties around the world right now,” CEO, John Grimes, told pv magazine Australia.
The first pilot of the scheme will up and running in first half of this year, if not sooner, Hamilton and Grimes say. Likely to follow in the footsteps of the CertifHy scheme already operating in the EU, Hamiltion says the pilot will put “flesh on the bones” of the Australian scheme. “There is an element in here of learning by doing,” Grimes added.
As for what the scheme will mean for Australia, the Council has great expectations. “Over the decades to come as we go to net zero by 2050, we will transition our economy from being a major exporter of coal and natural gas (LNG), to being an exporter of hydrogen,” Hamilton said.
The Council also had ideas about how to deliver even more bang for our buck here in Australia – including moving into production of certifiably green steel. “We’ve got the raw materials, we can capture the value by doing the value adding,” Grimes said.
“Really, the opportunity is ours and it’s as big as we want it to be,” Hamilton said. “The harder we go, the better we are. The only thing holding us back is a lack of ambition at a federal level.”
But the battle to make that future a reality lays not only in building an internationally workable foundation, but also vanquishing Australia’s incumbent fossil fuel industries from the hydrogen space.
“Being candid, I do think the fossil fuel industry sees a lifeline in hydrogen and do see an opportunity to extend the use of fossil fuels, particularly natural gas, in the production of hydrogen,” Grimes said.
“We want to call out the greenwashing that may occur if we’re not judicious about this [scheme].”

As part of a COAG agreement, the Australian federal and state governments have been working on a hydrogen certification scheme for the last two years. Mid-2020, it held a consultation with stakeholders in which it quickly became apparent to Hamilton that it wouldn’t be able to deliver any scheme quick enough.
Part of the issue is that, unlike SEC, Australian government is not looking to only certify zero emission hydrogen, but also blue and brown hydrogen – which are both derived from fossil fuels.
“We think the federal government is backing the wrong horse when it’s looking at fossil fuel hydrogen,” Hamilton said. Grimes agrees – saying that the Council’s discussions with other countries demonstrates the hydrogen market is really looking for green only.
Since earmarking zero emissions hydrogen its only target, Hamilton said the Council has been “blown away” with how many people and groups have sort to partner with them. “That’s both domestic companies… as well as international partners in various areas across the world – of course, Germany is key – but also Japan, USA, South Korea, Singapore and other parts of the EU.”
The Council’s partnership with the Germany Energy Agency is, so far, the most developed bilateral agreement. Germany, a world leader in renewables, is considerably further along the transition path than Australia. Also, with a seismic auto and transportation industry, as well as a green hydrogen train, Germany is in the market for hundreds of terawatt hours of green hydrogen and has a cool €9 billion (AU$14 billion) to throw around. “In terms of where they get it from, one of the potentials is places like us, Australia,” Hamilton says.
Hamilton also flagged the potential symbiosis of the German–Australian relationship, with German companies like Siemens potentially importing its technologies to Australia, accelerating our transition not only with their dollars but also its know-how.
The partnership is indicative of SEC’s approach more generally. That is, the Council is identifying which countries will be key partners going forward and developing a mutually beneficial version of its scheme with their input. “What we want to do is work with them so the certification scheme we build is going to meet their needs, as well as our needs.”
Ammonia the ‘first mover’ as transport dilemma comes into focus
Despite the rhetoric focussing heavily on hydrogen, Hamilton actually expects ammonia to be “one of the first movers” in terms of export opportunities. That is for the simple reason that ammonia is easier to move than hydrogen.
Which brings us to a point the Council quickly learned might prove sticky: transport. Initially, the Council were discussing a ‘well to gate’ strategy. That is, where it would certify everything from where the fuel or metal is made up until it leaves the port.
“But one of the questions that has come up really quickly from the markets that want [green hydrogen] is ‘what about the emissions that might be associated with the transport?’” Hamilton said.
How to certifying the fuel all the way to the customer, journey included, is now a question the Council’s horizon. “No final decision has been made about the size and scope of things, it will be dictated by what the market wants.”

The renewable boost, likely the combination of solar’s improved seasonal generation during summer and new WA wind farms coming online in September, is for Professor Ray Wills proof energy systems don’t crumble the minute renewable generation grows.
“Over a period of five days the South-West Interconnected System (SWIS) in Western Australia had in excess of 40% renewables generation for extended periods, and over 70% over a number of hours, and the SWIS operated just fine – without outages or compromise to energy security,” Professor Wills, Managing Director of Future Smart Strategies, told pv magazine Australia.

Western Australia is notably devoid of big batteries to date but is powering ahead in terms of solar installations and wind farms. As Daniel Kurz, Chief Operating Officer at Infinite Energy notes, December 2020 topped off another record month for WA with 35 MW of rooftop solar installed. “That caps off total installations for 2020 at 336 MW, up 40% from 2019,” Kurz told pv magazine Australia.
“This level of behind-the-meter generation combined with the commissioning of two large wind farms and large scale solar has significantly changed the landscape of generation in the South West Interconnected System,” Kurz added.
With 50% of WA households expected to have solar PV on their roofs by 2030, the state’s need to manage large swings in electricity loads means next critical piece of the renewable puzzle will clearly be batteries.
“Significant plans have been announced to bring both utility-scale battery storage to Western Australia as early as next year, and more significantly, a large amount of behind-the-meter storage, the combination of which will undoubtedly effectively address the legitimate concerns that will arise as renewables approach greater than (my number) 85% penetration,” Professor Wills said.
“Last decade was the decade of solar. This decade will be the decade of batteries – starting now.”
In October, the McGowan government announced plans for the first big battery which will connect to the state’s main grid, a 100 MW/200 MWh Battery Energy Storage System on the site of the decommissioned Kwinana power plant. Last year, the state also released its Distributed Energy Resources Roadmap, prioritising the trial and implementation innovative grid-stabilising strategies.

Indeed, agrivoltaics has picked up so much speed in recent times that in Q1 2021, pv magazine‘s UP Initiative has made Agri-PV its focus. 
In Australia, despite our extensive agriculture, agrivoltaics has not taken off as it has in other parts of the world. This is primarily because Australia has extensive land, and agrivoltaics is currently most valuable as a dual land use system in countries like Israel which have limited land, ample sun, and growing populations. 
However, Australians are starting to realise that the advantages of agrivoltaics are not just limited to dual-land use which produces clean energy and agricultural produce, but that the symbiotic relationship actually makes both systems more efficient and profitable. Unfortunately, there is still scepticism from some farmers in Australia who think solar panels will negatively impact their yields. And this is why the Victorian (VIC) Government is backing the Tatura SmartFarm in the Goulburn Valley with $5 million from its Smarter, Safer Farms initiative. 
The VIC Minister for Agriculture Mary-Anne Thomas, officially opened the SmartFarm this week and announced the Government’s Horticulture Solar Energy program which will examine the impacts of solar energy generation infrastructure and the sun protection it provides fruit trees. The program will see solar panels installed above a pear orchard. 
“Farmers and producers experience the impacts of climate change firsthand,” said Thomas, “it’s vital that we help them adapt so they can continue to get our world-class produce to markets across Australia and the world.”
Hence why the Tatura SmartFarm “is an important way for Victorian scientists to develop practical solutions to some of agriculture’s biggest problems, and to grow our export markets.”
This was a notion seconded by Mark Gepp, Member or Northern Victoria: “The Tatura SmartFarm is doing ground-breaking research that’ll help farmers across Australia – I’m really proud that this exciting work has started right here in Northern Victoria.”
Interestingly, the SmartFarm will also feature what is thought to be the world’s first sundial orchard. An orchard which fans out in multiple directions like a sundial replete with sensors to study the experimental designs impact on stonefruit and pomefruit. Experimenting with orchard designs is a way for researchers to understand how agriculture can cope with extreme climatic events.

Orchardvoltaics 
Combining solar with orchards is “undoubtedly a good idea,” said Brecht Willock, a researcher at Belgium’s KU Leuven who is part of a team testing agrivoltaics in a pear orchard, particularly for orchardists. This comes down to the trellising method of orchard plantation itself, which utilises the shade provided by the solar panels to protect fruits from excessive irradiance, while also allowing the trees to grow taller while requiring less water through reduced transpiration. 
This has shown to be particularly useful in a country like Israel, says Yaki Noyman, CEO of Doral Energy, a company at the forefront of Israel’s ambition to innovate its way to feeding its growing population on limited agricultural space. The sunny weather is excellent for solar energy “nearly all year long…but unfortunately, we cannot escape global warming, and days of extreme heat waves and lack of precipitation take a toll on farmers.” The ability of agrivoltaic methods to create microclimates becomes essential. 
At Doral’s pioneer facility in Kibbutz Maale Gilboa, the company’s orchardvoltaic model’s synergetic relationship begins in the observation that, like solar, orchards come in neat rows like corduroy. Above and between the orchard’s grooves stand solar panels sparkling like sequins in the sun, and at the roots are placed long white sheets. The sheets stretch away down the rows like an over-the-top wedding dress reflecting sunbeams up at the high-standing bi-facial panels and upon the fruit. The reflected light not only boosts the solar energy generated from the bifacial panels, but also benefits the fruit with added quality and colour.
In good news for brekky lovers around Australia, the fruit that seems to profit most from its symbiotic relationship with solar is the avocado. 
Science for the sceptics 
Brett Heather is the Chief Operating and Technical Officer at Alterra, a company which develops and manages agricultural land, including a planned 300-hectare avocado farm in Pemberton, Western Australia. Heather says solar energy aligns well with the supply and demand needs of an avocado orchard. “Good business principles, Heather said, “lead to good environmental outcomes.” 
However, Alterra is not planning on integrating solar with its crops, only laying out solar on the side. Even in Australia, said Heather, where land is not in short supply (Israel is 353 times smaller than Australia), “High quality land assets in premium regions are hard to come by, and installing solar panels is going to impact the plantable area and yields at a development.” 
This is the scepticism in Australian agriculture that experiments like SmartFarm will hopefully dispel. That installing solar panels in relationship with crops will negatively impact yield, if the researchers at SmartFarm find their empirical results replicate those seen in the Middle East, Europe, and other parts of the world, then solar integration in orchards may become a much more common sight, and that means more Avocado Smash for everyone.

An acceleration in FTM battery storage systems of this magnitude and torque lends added credence to the 7 GW of battery energy storage analysts from Cornwall Insight Australia’s say is currently in the pipeline. 
WoodMac’s report argues that battery price reductions along with improvements in battery density contributed to a fall in storage system prices that exceeded expectations in 2020. The latter improvements contributing to a lowering of balance of system (BOS) and other costs. 
Moreover, a less conspicuous but nonetheless important contributor to the lowering cost is the streamlining of hardware prices between countries and regions. 
“As batteries are expected to represent shrinking portion of all-in system costs, there will be heightened focus on BOS cost reductions moving forward” said WoodMac senior analyst Mitalee Gupta.
“Manufacturers will continue to innovate and produce BOS components that help reduce labour costs, and installation crews are implementing more efficient labour practices as they gain more experience on job sites” continued Gupta. “Competitive markets will drive system efficiencies, product standardisation and cheaper batteries as we progress towards 2025.” 
According to the report, Australia is expected to see costs decline by 34% to US$658 / kW in 2025 for a 2-hour duration all-in FTM system. At the end of 2020, that price was US$990 / kW. WoodMac foresees the installation of FTM systems accelerate nationwide. 
The Asia Pacific is the world’s largest manufacturer for lithium-ion batteries, points out Gupta. This trend is likely to continue “as the region’s storage industry takes off, every component across the value chain will play a role in bringing down system costs. Fire risks and safety standards, tariffs and trade policies, and safe-guarding the supply chain amidst Covid-19 uncertainty are factors that could make or break the industry.”  
Indeed, in recent months we have already witnessed the acceleration of FTM projects in anticipation of continuing price drops. From a 100 MW battery storage facility proposed just this week near Rockhampton, Queensland. To the slew of other projects announced just in the first fortnight of 2021, including Origin Energy’s plans for a 700 MW megabattey in NSW’s Hunter region as well as Neoen’s 500 MW battery planned west of Sydney. Australia’s largest power producer, AGL, also remains on track to add at least 850 MW of new large-scale battery storage to its portfolio by 2024.

At the height of summer two outages of this magnitude would potentially cripple the state’s power grid. However, thanks to the changing grid, primarily driven by duck curve solar uptake, the outages at Yallourn and Loy Yang A sites in the Latrobe Valley tripped at a time when there was little demand for power. 
In fact, according to Dylan McConnell, a National Energy Market (NEM) watcher at Melbourne’s Climate & Energy College, the demand was so low on this summer Sunday that wholesale prices fell into the negative for several hours. 
Incredibly low demand on the grid for electricity this weekend in Vic – particularly for a January.
Unsurprisingly, minimum in the middle of the day (c.f. previous Jan minimum – early morning several years back)⬇️https://t.co/Pixuwl8g0U pic.twitter.com/WKKFiZFNLK
— Dylan McConnell (@dylanjmcconnell) January 18, 2021

The trips took place at EnergyAustralia’s Yallourn and AGL Energy’s Loy Yang A coal-fired power stations. As McConnell’s graph shows, scheduled demand (not including rooftop solar) on the system at approximately 13:30 last Sunday fell below 2900 MW. “Incredibly low demand on the grid for electricity this weekend in VIC,” said McConnell, “particularly for a January.” 
According to an EnergyAustralia spokeswoman who spoke to AFR, “Demand was very low over the weekend – and at times prices were negative – so we took the opportunity to proactively take another unit offline for minor repair works.” This is to say, demand was so low that not only did two outages barely render a blip, but EnergyAustralia even felt comfortable enough to drop another unit voluntarily.

No doubt the record low demand has something to do with the 510,000+ Victorian homes now sporting solar systems. At least 100,000 of these are reportedly thanks to the Victorian Government’s Solar Homes program. 
As it crossed the half-a-million-rooftops rubicon, Victoria also chalked up 15,000 battery installations, with the government calculating that solar on top can save households up to $890 a year on electricity; and they can claw back an additional $640 per annum if a battery is integrated into the system to shift unused daytime generation to night-time supply.
“Victoria has embraced renewable energy — and we want to see these impressive figures rise even higher,” said Minister for Energy, the Environment and Climate Change, Lily D’Ambrosio in a statement this week.
Did you know there are now more than 510,000 small-scale PV systems in Victoria? That's 1 in every 5 homes, including Osman's! Rebates of up to $4,174 are available if you want to be part of the solar revolution #springst https://t.co/6kgMif4l2G pic.twitter.com/GbZfrxGI2r

The Victorian Budget 2020/21 provided $191 million to expand the number of solar rebates available to householders over the coming two years by 42,000; to offer 15,000 solar rebates to businesses; and to provide 17,500 solar batteries over three years throughout Victoria with no postcodes barred.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/20/eastern-indonesia-may-become-hub-for-large-scale-pv-deployment/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDONESIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 20, 2021",Eastern Indonesia may become hub for large scale PV deployment,"From pv magazine Global. 
Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) has announced that a big solar park will be built on a large area of land at an undisclosed location in eastern Indonesia, which includes all the islands other than Java, Sumatra, Bali, and Madura and, more specifically, provinces in Kalimantan, Sulawesi, West Nusa Tenggara, East Nusa Tenggara, West Timor, Maluku, and Irian Jaya.
“We are planning to build a solar park, like those in Abu Dhabi, Portugal and Saudi Arabia,” said minister Dadan Kusdiana, noting eastern Indonesia has a dry climate, high solar radiation levels and low rainfall.
The region is indeed particularly suitable for large scale PV deployment. “Eastern Indonesia is good because solar irradiation is generally higher than in other regions and the province of East Nusa Tenggara has one of the highest,” Marlistya Citraningrum, the program manager for sustainable energy access at the Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR), told pv magazine. “Higher PV output means more energy generated, and the availability of cheaper land with good contour and suitable slope also means we can drive down installation cost, lowering the electricity price.”
According to her, the government needs to lower overall electricity generation costs, which are higher in eastern Indonesia because of the extensive use of diesel power plants. “Energy access remains an issue there and renewable energy must be one of the answers,” she also stated.
As for western Indonesia, Citraningrum said the region is currently facing overcapacity and new solar power plants will probably be met with reluctance from Indonesian utility PT PLN (Persero), which in December started a pre-qualification process on its procurement portal to choose independent power producers to develop utility scale solar plants. “The call for IPPs is not exactly because PLN will tender solar power plants, it is probably a measure to update their list of pre-qualified companies or to anticipate the coming presidential regulation on feed-in tariffs,” she further explained.
Indonesia began supporting large scale PV via a law issued in April 2017. The country’s cumulative installed PV capacity remains negligible, at roughly 198 MW by the end of 2019, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
The Indonesian government is targeting to deploy 6.5 GW of solar by 2025 and 45 GW by 2050.
