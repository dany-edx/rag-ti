The news was sparked by the release of the NSW Network Infrastructure Strategy, a 20-year plan for the state’s transmission infrastructure and Renewable Energy Zones (REZ), prepared by its infrastructure planner, EnergyCo.
In light of this new document, a number of media outlets have published and republished the below table outlining huge disparities in the costings of the Central West Orana REZ and the New England REZ, with the former apparently costing an additional $3 billion while the latter appears $3 billion cheaper.

Where these ‘previous public estimates’ originated from is unstated here, but some outlets point to Australia’s national energy planning document, known as the Integrated System Plan or ISP, as the source.
What the 2022 ISP actually forecast was the cost of the Central West Orana transmission link, which it estimated at between $450 million and $850 million, and modelled at $650 million. Pv magazine Australia cannot find any forecasts in the ISP around the capital costs of the entire Central West Orana REZ, but given the zone initially proposed adding 3 GW of renewables to the grid, $650 million beggars belief.
Media outlets have also reported the Central West Orana REZ has been delayed from July 2025 to 2027/28. Again, in the ISP the 2025 timeline relates to the transmission link, not the entire zone. 
The NSW Network Infrastructure Strategy, published today, is the first detailed government assessment of both the timeframes and capital costs of the state’s renewable energy zones and related transmission infrastructure. That fact alone casts questions over how cost “blowouts” and delays could become the centrepiece of reporting.
The Strategy essentially seeks to clarify the order and magnitude of the state’s energy transition projects to realise the Electricity Infrastructure Investment Act 2020, a policy introduced by NSW’s former Coalition government under Energy Minister Matt Kean. This is, the document outlines how NSW will deliver 12 GW of renewable generation and 2 GW of storage as soon as practicable before most of the state’s coal plants close in 2033.
According to the Guardian, NSW’s new energy minister, Penny Sharpe, briefed journalists about the strategy document on Wednesday, ahead of its release. It reports: “Sharpe said the price of transmission infrastructure and preliminary works to connect the [Central West Orana] zone to the broader network had originally been costed at about $400 million to $800 million but it was now expected to cost about $3.2 billion.”
This distinction between the initial costs relating to a particular piece of supporting transmission rather than whole Orana REZ appears to have been lost in the reporting of most outlets. This may be because the key message of Sharpe’s briefing hinged on delays and cost blowouts.
“This strategy is the first time that the likely costs have been identified and published on the specific projects. I am concerned that costs and timeframes have grown since they were first proposed in 2020,” Sharpe said.

Alongside Central West Orana REZ, delays to the state’s largest zone, the New England REZ, have been reported. Renew Economy said the New England REZ’s completion date has been delayed from 2027 to 2029, while The Guardian reported those dates refer to the start of construction on the zone. 
It is not clear to pv magazine Australia where the 2027 date originated from, but given the zone is planned to host 6 GW of renewable capacity it seems all but impossible such a feat could be completed by 2027, especially since the zones are made up of numerous individual projects constructed by private companies.
The overall cost of NSW’s transformation has also been confusingly reported, with the Australian Financial Review quoting $10.6 billion, saying this figure relates to poles and wires only. Meanwhile, the Sydney Morning Herald came to a conclusion of $9.3 billion by 2030.

The correct estimated figure is $9.7 billion within the next decade (2033). The figure is made up of a $1.9 billion preliminary estimate to realise two transmission and a storage project, namely the Hunter Transmission Project, the Southern Sydney Ring and the Waratah Super Battery.
The bulk of the spend comes from renewable energy zones, with the preliminary estimate sitting at $7.8 billion. It is worth noting EnergyCo has not modelled the costs of the fifth Illawarra REZ.
These preliminary estimates include clauses stating the projections could be up to 50% more or less.

As mentioned, today’s document includes the first real cost and timeline estimates for the state’s energy transformation, which largely rests on the five renewable energy zones being delivered by EnergyCo.
The Strategy was drawn up in collaboration with with AEMO Services, which acts as the ‘Consumer Trustee’ in NSW.

Andrew Kingsmill, Executive Director Technical at EnergyCo, said the NSW Electricity Roadmap is a third of the way to delivering the state’s promised 14 GW by 2030.
The Network Infrastructure Strategy is a part of realising this roadmap and is designed to inform the Infrastructure Investment Objectives Report, which underpins the tender plan for NSW’s generation, firming and storage auctions. That is, EnergyCo assesses project options, including doing community consultations, and then makes recommendations to AEMO Services for its Objectives Report, which then go to market.
While the main focus is on the next decade, the strategy proposes options which add between 14 GW and 24 GW of capacity over the next 20 years, depending on the modelled scenario. They are grouped into: ‘deliver now,’ meaning projects needed ASAP, ‘secure now,’ meaning projects that follow on from the first batch, and ‘plan for the future,’ which are on the 20 year  horizon.

These projects would represent about 5% of wholesale electricity costs over the next 20 years, EnergyCo says, but could unlock up to four times the value in generation, storage and firming infrastructure.
EnergyCo’s ‘deliver now’ projects, it says, consist of only ‘no regret’ options, meaning they benefit electricity consumers under all modelled scenarios. EnergyCo lists those projects as such:

While the state’s renewable energy zones will obviously require significant amounts of new network infrastructure, EnergyCo also notes it is “exploring options” for small-scale distribution network upgrades and storage projects in the shorter term while these bigger projects are being built. 
Transmission, and specifically community opposition to transmission, is heating up in Australia. In March, the NSW government published a review detailing the renewable energy sector’s conflicts with agriculture, which has driven much opposition, especially around renewable energy zones. “The friction that is emerging may be the most significant risk to policy success,” the government report states.
One of the things opposing communities often call for is the undergrounding of transmission lines. EnergyCo draws a pretty firm line around this in the document, pointing to a number of reasons why underground high voltage direct current (HVDC) are rarely appropriate. Not only is it more expensive, EnergyCo says the environmental benefits are overblown and underground lines are significantly harder to repair. “The costs and benefits of undergrounding were independently assessed for the HumeLink project in NSW,” it states. “The assessment found that an underground transmission for that project scope would cost more than three times that of the overhead options, with a two- to three-year delay in project delivery.”
Editions of the Network Infrastructure Strategy are set to come every two years, with EnergyCo noting that future updates will include more details on emerging technologies and markets like offshore wind, green hydrogen, and long-duration storage.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/25/nasa-makes-unusual-discovery-while-testing-perovskite-solar-cells-in-space/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"MAY 25, 2023",NASA makes unusual discovery while testing perovskite solar cells in space,"From pv magazine Global
NASA has revealed the results of an experiment it conducted to assess the performance and durability of perovskite solar cells on the International Space Station.
The agency said that it tested a perovskite absorber over a 10-month period in order to assess its resistance to vacuum, extreme temperatures, radiation, and light stressors simultaneously.
“There is no ground analog, no machine that will do all of those crazy things to it at the same time quite like the International Space Station,” said researcher Lyndsey McMillon-Brown.
The scientists attached the film to the outer side of the space station and exposed it to space conditions from March 2020 to January 2021. It then returned to NASA’s laboratories on Earth and its status was compared to that of a reference device on the ground. The research group said the space-traveling perovskite cell’s sunlight-absorbing qualities were surprisingly restored when hit by solar light on Earth, while the reference showed stronger degradation when exposed to the same conditions.
“The perovskite film was still dark black after spending 10 months on the International Space Station, proving her team’s innovative solar cell material is suitable for possible use on future space missions,” said McMillon-Brown. “We don’t know exactly what about the space environment gave our film this superpower.”
Looking forward, the NASA team said that it will try to find out which specific parts of the space environment transformed the perovskite.
“Not only do they survive, but in some ways, they thrived. I love thinking of the applications of our research and that we’re going to be able to meet the power needs of missions that are not feasible with current solar technologies,” said McMillon-Brown.
The results confirmed earlier research showing that the lack of moisture and oxygen outside of Earth’s atmosphere is actually beneficial to perovskite cells, and that the cells could be more suitable for operation in space without any major changes. The group said that there is huge potential for improvements in terms of stability and lifetime, and that proving the cell for long-term operation in space will be the next research step.

Chinese inverter manufacturer Sungrow has unveiled a new power optimiser for applications in rooftop PV systems.
“Thanks to the innovative shade-proof smart control technology developed by Sungrow, the SP600S can separately optimise mismatched modules,” the company said in a statement. “To cope with the ever-changing shading conditions, resulting from varying sunlight angles and orientations, Sungrow’s shade-proof control technology automatically detects the sun exposure status of the modules in real-time.”
The device has a rated input power of 600 W, with a maximum efficiency of 99.4% and a weighted efficiency of 98.8%. It offers a maximum output current of 16 A and a maximum output voltage of 80 V.
The device measures 86 mm x 108 mm x 25 mm and weighs 0.5 kg, featuring an IP68 enclosure. The manufacturer said the new product could increase the power yield of a PV system by 4% to 30%, depending on the operating conditions of the array.
“It can accommodate up to 30 modules per string to achieve the optimal installation capacity and it supports mixed installation of strings with different lengths and modules with different power ratings, making the system design process more flexible,” said Sungrow.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/25/pv-module-reliability-scorecard-released-by-pvel/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,QUALITY,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 25, 2023",PV Module Reliability Scorecard released by PVEL,"From pv magazine USA
PV Evolution Labs (PVEL), an independent test lab for the downstream solar industry and member of the Kiwa Group, published its 2023 PV Module Reliability Scorecard. This year’s Scorecard names 250 model types of PV modules from 35 manufacturers as Top Performers in PVEL’s testing, the most in the company’s history.
The Scorecard summarises results from the PV Module Product Qualification Program (PQP), a testing regime established by PVEL in 2012 to provide empirical data for PV module benchmarking and project-level energy yield and financial models.
Now in its ninth edition, the Scorecard provides more than just module testing, while its current iteration includes additional factors such as frames, glass, cells, backsheets, encapsulants and junction boxes. In the backsheet category, for example, 24 backsheet models were tested, 47% of which used a backsheet and 53% used rear glass to cover and protect the back of modules.
In terms of module technologies, p-type PERC is still the dominant technology across the Top Performers, TOPCon is also rising to the top. This year there are 37 TOPCon model types listed as Top Performers, up from just one in 2022. Heterojunction (HJT) is also on the rise, with nine HJT modules rated as a Top Performer, compared to just two last year.
Manufacturers of the thirteen top rated modules have had Top Performers for three years in a row. JinkoSolar and Trina Solar have been Top Performers since 2014, while Qcells and REC Solar since 2016.
The 2023 PV Module Reliability Scorecard shows Top Performers for six PQP test categories. To earn the rank of Top Performer, the modules must have < 2% power degradation following the particular test, a threshold that PVEL has used since 2018. For that reliability test they must not have experienced a wet leakage failure, a ‘major’ defect during visual inspection, or a diode failure.
“Solar technology and the manufacturer landscape continue to evolve rapidly, and with module supply issues persisting, buyers need guidance on how to procure the best possible modules for their projects,” said Tristan Erion-Lorico, VP of sales and marketing at PVEL. “Our 2023 Scorecard features a truly global list of module manufacturers. For buyers worldwide looking to understand the critical differences across cell technologies and module designs, our Scorecard provides many key insights and an easy way to search through the best commercially available options for developers.”
While it could seem that overall quality has improved because of the increasing number of Top Performer manufacturers and models, the percentage of manufacturers that experienced a failure also increased. Additionally, almost one third of the bills of materials (BOMs) tested suffered at least one failure during testing, and 15% of BOMs had a failure before stress testing.
Modules tested for the 2023 Scorecard were manufactured in 12 different countries, with sales worldwide. Also included in this year’s Scorecard are case studies from the factory and the field, showing how real-world performance is addressed through reliability testing.
Participation in PVEL’s PQP and Scorecard is voluntary for manufacturers and only top-performing module model types are named in the Scorecard. To date, PVEL has tested over 500 BOMs from more than 60 manufacturers for the PV Module PQP.
The Scorecard is publicly accessible in digital format, and includes a searchable and exportable database. Top Performers can be filtered by PQP test, cell technology, factory location, power class and more. Search results can also be downloaded and exported directly from the site.
