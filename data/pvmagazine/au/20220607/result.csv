The ACT’s Independent Competition and Regulatory Commission (ICRC) announced on Monday that regulated tariffs provided by government-owned retailer ActewAGL will decrease by at least 1.25% from 1 July, 2022.
ICRC senior commissioner Joe Dimasi said the ACT is the only jurisdiction in the national electricity market (NEM) where regulated tariffs would decline in 2022-23.
“The minimum average decrease of 1.25% will translate to an annual bill saving of $23 for an average residential customer consuming 6,500kWh,” he said. “For an average non-residential customer consuming 25,000kWh, the decrease in the annual bill will be $88,”
“The average annual bill for Canberrans on standing offers will be the lowest compared to the average standing offer bills faced by customers in New South Wales (NSW), Victoria, Queensland and South Australia (SA).”
Millions of households across the NEM face a major increase in their energy costs at the end of the month after the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) last week announced a double-digit percentage increase in the benchmark electricity price for some states.
The AER’s latest default market offer (DMO) determination finds higher coal and gas costs will leave consumers in NSW, southeast Queensland and SA paying much more for their electricity. The new DMO comes into effect on 1 July, 2022.

The biggest price hikes have occurred in the coal-power dependent states of Queensland and NSW. The DMO shows a rise of between 8.5% and 14.1% for standing offer customers in NSW, meaning customers could face a price hike between $119 and $227. In southeast Queensland there will be an increase of 11.3% meaning an additional $165 while South Australians will pay an extra $124, up 7.2%.
Small business owners in those jurisdictions will also suffer energy price increases, with the DMO increasing by up to 19.7%, 12.8% and 5.7% in NSW, southeast Queensland and SA respectively.
The AER cited rising wholesale costs, compounded by the conflict in Ukraine which has led to “significant” pressure on coal and gas around the world for the increase.
The AER said the pressures had been compounded by extreme weather events in NSW and Queensland affecting coal supplies and electricity demand, and unplanned outages at fossil-fuel fired generators.
The ICRC said the ACT government’s locking in of long-term renewable energy contracts to source the equivalent of 100% of the territory’s electricity consumption from renewable energy sources, including large-scale wind and solar farms, has more than offset the spike in wholesale electricity costs.
“The price reduction is driven by the reduction in ACT government scheme costs, which more than offset the increase in wholesale electricity costs. ACT government scheme costs put downward pressure on prices this year,” the ICRC said.
The ACT was the first jurisdiction in Australia to make the transition to 100% renewable energy, helped by an economy that lacks gas-dependent manufacturing and heavy industry.
The first step on the road to 100% renewable energy was a long-term contract with the 20MW Royalla Solar Farm, one of Australia’s oldest utility scale solar projects. The ACT also locked in deals with other large generators, completing the switch in 2020.
ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr was quick to respond to the ICHC’s update of regulated retail electricity prices, saying the early switch to renewables had protected the territory.
“In August 2015, I committed the ACT to achieving 100% renewable electricity by 2025. We got there ahead of time in 2020,” he tweeted. “One of the results of this policy ambition, and accelerated delivery, was on display today.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/07/rec-our-future-is-in-hjt/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,SINGAPORE",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"JUNE 7, 2022",REC: “Our future is in HJT”,"pv magazine: REC just introduced your newest module, the REC Alpha Pure-R. Its predecessor, the Alpha Pure, picked up the Intersolar Award this year in Munich. I understand that the fact that you were able to eliminate lead was a major reason the jury selected the module as a winner. How would you describe the module’s features?
Cemil Seber: The REC Alpha Pure-R integrates G12 wafers, with heterojunction (HJT) technology, half-cut cells, and we’ve maximized power in compact a format as possible with gapless interconnection. And as with every Alpha product it comes with the advantages of HJT technology, like high efficiency and a low temperature coefficient. With the compact size and two support bars, it means that customers can have a good feeling about the warranty – including with heavy snow or wind loads. We really feel we’ve hit the sweet spot in terms of aligning what is best with efficiency, size, sustainability, and on the usual product specs that everybody uses to benchmark PV panels.

I mentioned lead-free, how was it that you were able to do away with all lead entirely?
Some lead can be in the silver paste, but we use lead-free paste. Additionally, we are now using innovative solder-free foil and wire combination, eliminating again the lead-content here. The other place where lead is being used is on the cross connectors, where the lead is used for the soldering. Also, in the JB [junction box] lead is used for the solder. In the Alpha Pure-R, the cross connectors aren’t soldered with lead and there’s no soldering in the JB with lead. These things are easier said than done. But we reduced the lead in the Alpha and now we’ve eliminated it with the Alpha Pure Series.
The foil interconnection was called “busbarless” some years ago. Of course, initially, REC worked with Meyer Burger with the Smartwire technology. How have you moved forward without Meyer Burger on the cell interconnection?
We’re expanding our initial HJT production from 600 MW to 1.2 GW, and for the expansion we’re doing that with equipment that is not from Meyer Burger. REC has worked intensively for many years with its key suppliers to develop other methods that will still be foil and wire based, proprietary to REC.
Looking more closely at the expansion, Meyer Burger also provided the deposition tooling for the HJT cell production. How will you move forward without Meyer Burger providing support and the production equipment?
We have run more HJT cell production than anyone in the world successfully; we have produced close to 1.5 of HJT and have successfully put that on the market. You also have to remember that REC has been in the PV industry for 25 years. We had skeptics with the first Alpha [HJT] modules, but we’ve proven them wrong. HJT also has less processes than other cell technologies and when you have good process control you can have very stable production. The part where REC really excels is in the industrialization of these new technologies and we have a head start. We launched Alpha with HJT in 2019, so we did it 2.5 years before anyone else.
And where will the expansions beyond the 1.2 GW in Singapore take place? We have heard of a facility in France for some time now. And, of course, since REC’s acquisition by Reliance Industries, Indian manufacturing is also an option.
We were acquired by Reliance on December 1, 2021. And with regards to PV, we are the cornerstone of what they want to do. Singapore has been the center of excellence for REC and it will continue to be that way. We had 600 MW of Alpha Pure HJT production capacity and we are adding another 600 MW of Alpha Pure-R. We are currently working on that expansion plan for Singapore – and in August that production capacity will be operating.
In India, we are building cell and module capacities at gigawatt scale. Reliance is looking both upstream and downstream and wants to deploy in the hundreds-of-gigawatts of PV. Of course, REC will be supporting the expansion in India. Outside of that, we have our two main markets: the U.S. and Europe. And right now we are in the planning stages and considering our options in both of these regions.
Can you give me a bit more detail on the French factory?
What we can say is that we are in the planning stage and there are multiple scenarios for what we can do. There are geopolitical dynamics which are favoring manufacturing in both Europe and the U.S.
What about further upstream to wafers or even polysilicon – because this is where REC in Norway has its heritage?
We have a strong expertise across the whole value chain, from silicon in Norway up to modules in Singapore. This expertise is critical in order to control all processes and ensure high quality of the final product and it’s a strong value in our expansion plans.
Turning back to Europe, there seems to be a lot of energy in the market at the moment – for installations and manufacturing. What’s your message for the market?
I think a key message is: “We’re growing and we are hiring!” We need to enjoy the moment also. REC has launched a new product and we have bigger plans and some of those plans are very concrete and we are talking about them openly. Others are in the scenario planning phase. Our focus is HJT, and our future is in HJT.

“They rely on a new frame structure that provides better protection for the glass surface,” marketing manager Helga Ruscsák told pv magazine. “They can be used for pavement, terraces, driveways, sidewalks, parks, bicycle roads, marinas, and low-traffic roads, as well as for other industrial and off-grid applications.”
The modules come in variants featuring conventional monocrystalline and polycrystalline cells, with a choice of clear or opal glass. All of the products measure 359mm x 359mm x 41mm and weigh 6.5kg.
The polycrystalline products feature 156mm x 156mm 18.6%-efficient solar cells, with a nominal power of 18.2 W. It has an open-circuit voltage of 2.56 V and a short-circuit current of 8.9 A.
The monocrystalline panels have a power conversion efficiency of 22.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 2.72 V, and a short-circuit current of 8.89 A. They are fabricated with four cells measuring 158.7 mm x 158.7 mm.

The panels are covered by 10mm of tempered glass treated with an acid-etched pattern. They are also equipped with a frame made of a polymer composite based on low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) with matrix-forming material.
“The frame is made out of 100% recycled plastic,” Ruscsák said.
All the modules have a maximum allowed vehicle wheel load of 2 tons per module. The manufacturer claims a vehicle with a maximum weight of 8 tons could drive on the modules.
“We do not intend to build solar highways or solar roads with our products,” Ruscsák said.
Platio Solar said the solar cells have the same lifecycle of those used in conventional panels, despite being exposed to mechanical stress.
“Several tests have been performed at this regard during the CE certification process,” Ruscsák said, noting that the modules have a low-voltage system, which makes walking on them a safe option.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/07/australian-miner-seals-tesla-lithium-supply-deal/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 7, 2022",Australian miner seals Tesla lithium supply deal,"Perth-based miner Liontown Resources has formalised an offtake agreement to supply United States-based electric vehicle  manufacturer Tesla with up to 150,000 tonnes of lithium spodumene concentrate from the Kathleen Valley high-grade lithium project being developed in Western Australia.
Under the agreement, Liontown will supply Tesla, which expects to spend more than $1 billion a year on raw materials from Australia for its batteries, with 100,000 dry metric tonnes in the first year of the five-year deal, increasing to 150,000 tonnes per annum in subsequent years.
ASX-listed Liontown said supply of the spodumene concentrate, a critical mineral used in the production of lithium-ion batteries, is expected to commence in 2024, and the agreement is subject to the company commencing commercial production at Kathleen by no later than December 1, 2025.
Liontown managing director and chief executive officer Tony Ottaviano said the Tesla agreement represents approximately one-third of the project’s start-up production capacity.
“Tesla is a global leader and innovator in electric vehicles and having formalised arrangements for it to become a significant customer is a tremendous achievement,” he said.
“This means that we now have two of the premier companies in the global lithium-ion battery and EV space signed up as foundational customers, marking a significant step towards realising our ambition to become a globally significant provider of battery materials for the clean energy market.”
Liontown’s latest deal complements its existing agreement to supply South Korean electronics giant LG Energy Solution with up to 150,000 tonnes per year.
The Kathleen Valley project, being developed near Leinster, about 680 kilometres north-east of Perth, is expected to initially produce about 500,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate per annum, eventually ramping up to about 660,000 tonnes. Construction of the project is scheduled to commence by the fourth quarter of 2022.
Liontown said up to 60% of its planned production is now covered by long-term agreements with high-quality customers.
The company said it continued to receive strong interest from a range of parties for the remaining third offtake which, once completed, would result in about 85% of production from Kathleen Valley being contracted. The remaining production will be sold on spot or Liontown has an option to sell to existing customers.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/07/ultra-thin-inverted-perovskite-solar-cell-with-20-2-efficiency/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 7, 2022",Ultra-thin inverted perovskite solar cell with 20.2% efficiency,"Researchers at Peking University in China have fabricated an ultrathin perovskite solar cell based on parylene C, a chlorinated poly(para-xylylene) polymer that withstands high temperatures, with low moisture permeability to moisture and remarkable electrical and physical properties.
They used a commercially available 3-µm-thick parylene C and embedded it in the solar cell via a flip-over transferring (FOT) technique. They claimed that this ensured that the polymer had a smooth surface. They also used chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for the deposition of the parilene C on the pre-cleaned glass substrate.
In addition, the scientists used a 210-nm-thick zirconium (Zr), titanium (Ti) and gallium doped indium oxide (ITGZO) as the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) electrodes of the solar cell. They used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to compare the performance of the cell with a reference device based on parylene F, which is another type of polymer, and a cell with a glass substrate without the polymer.
“The perovskite films on parylene-F exhibited poor film coverage with several pinholes on the film surface and showed interfacial voids at embedded bottom interfaces which would lead to charge accumulation and induce the loss of device performance,” the scientists said. “For perovskite films prepared on parylene-C, better film uniformity same as glass-based films was obtained as evidenced by the disappearance of surficial pinholes and interfacial voids.”
The parylene-C-based PV cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 20.2%, which is a value that the researchers describe as in line with that of perovskite cells of common thickness.
“Due to the high PCE and light device weight of 6.67 g/m2 on parylene-C substrates, an outstanding power-per-weight of 30.3 W/g was realized, indicating the great promise of fabricating efficient, ultrathin and ultralight solar cells with parylene-C films,” they concluded.
The researchers presented their findings in “Ultralight flexible perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Science China Materials.
