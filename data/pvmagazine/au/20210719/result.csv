The Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) has identified that the nation’s energy market will be increasingly reliant on dispatchable storage to firm up the expanding volume of renewable energy as well as address the growing need for critical system security services as the fossil fuel-fired power stations retire over the coming decades.
According to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), the new capacity required to replace the nation’s existing fossil fuel generation will be in the order of 26-50 GW by 2040, and this will come from variable sources such as large-scale wind and solar.
As a result, AEMO anticipates that between 6 GW and 19 GW of new dispatchable resources will be needed across the National Electricity Market to provide firming support for this influx of new renewable capacity.
Sterling and Wilson Solar Australia chief executive Philip Sheridan said that demand for system strength has made it clear that batteries can improve returns on large-scale solar investments, allowing for maximum solar output at a time when investors have to price in factors such as grid congestion, curtailment and connection risks into their projects.
“We’ve seen some of the challenges with the PV plants at the moment through curtailment related to grid set-ups etc but we certainly see good opportunity for the solar PV and battery storage set-ups,” he said.
“Building in battery storage unlocks the untapped potential to harness solar energy. Being able to generate during the day and being able to store and then dispatch in periods of peak demand has certainly got real opportunity.
“It allows for intermittent solar energy to be stored for later use when it is needed, supporting the balancing of constantly changing levels of supply and demand through the day.”
Sheridan said data analysis conducted by Sterling and Wilson had determined that large-scale solar+storage compares well against gas as a source of peaking power.

“The value proposition in solar+storage plants is increasingly getting more advantageous, as the price of the batteries keep falling and is expected to decline 25-30% by 2025,” the analysis reads.
“The DC coupling option with the hybrid inverters, boosts a significant saving on the cost of balance of system and supports the case of solar+storage plants.”
Sterling and Wilson have forecast that with large-scale solar+storage becoming more economical, the cumulative solar+storage BESS capacity could reach nearly 4.2 GWh by 2025.
“However, we believe that the numbers are likely to exceed these projections as storage becomes increasingly central to managing grid stability,” the company said.
The analysis did however offer a caution, saying designing a solar+storage plant for a 24 hours RTC supply is not a commercially viable option and not a recommended one.
“As per our analysis, the solar PV projects coupled with battery storage up to four hours, will have a better LCOE ($/kWh) compared with the conventional gas/peaker plants,” Sterling and Wilson said.
“In today’s market pricing, two to four hours of storage is the sweet spot which most of the IPPs/developers are eyeing in.”
“We’re talking over a relatively short period but if you’ve got the opportunity to capture those few hours we certainly see that as advantageous,” Sheridan said.

Sheridan said the solar+battery storage combination offers other benefits when compared to traditional gas peaker plants with batteries able to ramp up quickly and provide a better frequency response.
“And from a costing perspective the time to design and build is significantly improved on a gas plant,” he said. “The timeframe for going through the planning, the build phase, the commissioning phase is advantageous.”
“So as things improve on the grid, this technology can be running in parallel or immediately behind to then bring that on, especially as some of these existing fossil fuel plants start to retire through the next few years.”
Sterling and Wilson’s Australian EPC order book includes five major solar PV projects with a cumulative total of more than 1.1 GW, including Neoen’s 460 MW Western Downs Green Power Hub in Queensland and the 174 MW Wellington Solar Farm being developed by Lightsource BP in New South Wales. None of the projects currently include battery storage but at least three have the provision for it to be added at a later date and Sheridan said clients are starting to explore the possibility.
“In our conversations with clients and potential clients we’re seeing that on some of our existing projects there’s a provision for that future investment and addition of storage facilities on the PV plants,” he said.
“A number of entities are already starting to move towards those grid-scale battery projects and we’re seeing some of our clients certainly looking at it and there are significant large-scale battery storage elements starting to happen now.”
Figures published by the Clean Energy Council (CEC) earlier this year show that since 2018, 8.9 GW of large-scale battery storage has been financially committed, proposed and/or approved in Australia.
This includes at least 15 large-scale battery storage projects announced this year alone, representing more than 6.6 GW of capacity and $4.3 billion in investment.
CEC chief executive Kane Thornton said he expects the commercial case for batteries will only get better as battery technology advances, greater economies of scale reduce the cost, and new markets are established to reward the services they provide.
“However, long-term investment certainty remains reliant on appropriate market reforms and forward-looking policies that incentivise new, flexible technologies that are needed to complement renewables,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/19/solar-export-charging-a-solution-or-just-added-confusion/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JULY 19, 2021",Solar export charging: a solution or just added confusion?,"In a few years a new complexity could be added to the mix: the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) is deciding right now if they should change the rules of the National Electricity Market and allow solar customers to be charged for exporting energy to the grid. This would become just another confusing factor that Aussie homes and businesses would have to consider when weighing up if they should invest in solar. 
The AEMC’s proposal is being put forward to alleviate grid constraints associated with a surplus of solar energy in the middle of the day – but the proposal is far from popular. The debate about solar export charging, also known as the ‘sun tax’, has divided energy stakeholders and even state governments. 
In recent submissions to the AEMC, both Victoria and Queensland argued that they don’t think export charging is justified at this time. Queensland’s submission goes further by saying: “Customers who invest in DER are contributing to a global effort to reduce the impacts of climate change and should continue to be appropriately rewarded for providing this service.”
A number of states, including Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania, are requesting that they get to choose if the new rules apply in their jurisdiction or not. If this goes ahead we’re going to see solar owners in some states protected while others are slapped with fees for exporting clean energy to their neighbours.
The debate about solar export charging is a hot button issue and many stakeholders in the energy sector are calling for more details about the AEMC’s proposal. How much will these charges be? Under what circumstances will they be applied to solar consumers? Will retailers pass on individualised export charges, and if so, what additional administrative costs will that incur?
The complexities of this proposal raise more questions than they answer, and without broad support from consumers, the energy sector and state governments, the AEMC should go back to the drawing board. 
There are alternative approaches that state governments and network service providers can implement that will allow for the continued uptake of rooftop solar, which include:
In response to the Australian Energy Market Commission’s proposal to allow solar export charging, key stakeholders have raised concerns about whether this proposal is firstly justified, and secondly the best approach to managing the continued growth of rooftop solar. 
To take stock of the extensive feedback the AEMC has received on the proposal, they’ve delayed the release of their final determination until August 12 – so we’ll have to wait and see to what extent they consider the concerns raised by State governments, consumers and experts in the energy sector.

Government-owned utility said it had earlier this month received approval for the 100 MW/200 MWh battery which will be housed at the decommissioned Kwinana Power Station south of Perth. The battery will store enough energy to power 160,000 homes for two hours, providing additional security and stability to WA’s power system.
Synergy said it the battery is a major component of its future asset mix and a demonstration of the gen-tailer’s commitment to the delivery of safe, reliable and affordable energy.
“Increasing levels of large-scale and rooftop intermittent renewable generation has led the rapid transformation of the energy sector, presenting a range of opportunities related to how electricity is produced, managed and consumed,” the company said.
“The battery project will enable Synergy to optimise the use of its existing generation assets and provide network and system services to increase system security, providing a more sustainable, reliable and effective power supply to the wider region.”
Major expansion planned for hybrid energy hub
Still on batteries and developer SAPGen has lodged an application to expand the battery energy storage system at its planned 422 MW Summerfield Power Station in South Australia.
SAPGen has already obtained Development Approval for the large-scale hybrid energy project, comprising 380 MW of natural gas combined cycle turbines, a 12 MW solar farm, and 30 MW battery storage system.
The battery system was originally only going to be used to assist with the ramping up of the CCGT plant, but SAPGen has spotted an opportunity due to the high levels of renewables in the state’s grid and has applied to increase the capacity of the approved battery storage facility by 210 MW. The developer is also considering expanding the solar PV farm to as much as 600 MW.
“The addition of the expanded battery seeks to build upon the objectives for the project whilst also assisting to address current network challenges,” the application reads.
“Battery systems will be a critical part of the solution to address the current network challenges and to ensure a low-cost and secure electricity system.”
While the expansion project includes both solar and battery, the development application is limited to the expansion of the battery component. A development application for the solar expansion is proposed to be lodged as a separate stage at a later time.

Gunnedah solar project rejected
A proposed $6.9 million solar farm set to be built at Gunnedah, west of Tamworth in regional New South has been rejected with the Northern Regional Planning Panel (NRPP) declaring the 5 MW facility “would not be in the public interest”.
The NRPP was unanimous in its decision to knock back the 5 MW solar farm after Gunnedah Shire Council had received about one dozen submissions opposing the project, including concerns about possible negative impacts on house and land prices.
The project is one of a handful of solar farms proposed by NSW Community Renewables, part of the Providence Asset Group.
The solar farm was to be built on agricultural land at 262 Hunts Road, Gunnedah, but the NRPP said there is potential for “land use conflict”.
“The site is reasonably close to residential areas and it is possible that it will be nominated as a future residential area in the current strategic planning review being undertaken by council,” the panel wrote in its decision.
The project is completely separate to Canadian Solar’s 110 MW Gunnedah Solar Farm.
That facility has already connected to the grid and began sending power into the New South Wales grid earlier his month. It is expected to reach commercial operation before the end of the year.
Study shows green hydrogen facility viable
Mining company QEM’s plans to produce green hydrogen at its Julia Creek vanadium and oil shale project in north Queensland remain on track after a pre-feasibility study found the site well suited for a wind farm.
QEM earlier this year engaged technical consultant DNV Australia to conduct a pre-feasibility study (PFS) focusing on the potential of solar PV and wind farms to power a green hydrogen production facility at the remote location.
The first stage of the PFS has been completed and provides a positive indication of the viability to develop a 126 MW wind farm on site. DNV is currently investigating solar farm potential as the second stage of the PFS.
“The results of the wind farm stage of the study brings QEM another step closer to becoming a pioneering Queensland producer of green hydrogen,” QEM managing director Gavin Loyden said.
The second stage of the PFS is expected to be completed by the end of the month.

The new product is based on monocrystalline PERC cells, is fitted with an Enphase IQ 7A microinverter and features tempered glass with anti-reflective coating, and an anodized aluminium frame.
The module can be used in operating temperatures of between -40 degrees Celsius and 60 degrees Celsius and its operating temperature coefficient is -0.34% per degree Celsius. It comes with a 25-year limited performance and product guarantee. The maximum annual degradation is claimed to be 0.45% and 25-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.2% of the nominal output power.
The company said the new panel with pre-attached microinverter offers installers more efficient installations, simplified logistics and stock management and more flexible system designs.
Maxeon Solar Technologies chief executive Jeff Walters said the panel provides residential customers with a system that can be designed to maximize power output and offers superior reliability in real-world conditions like weather events and shade.
He said the AC architecture also provides the flexibility to expand the solar system as energy needs evolve, accommodating electric vehicle charging, AC storage, and the electrification of home appliances.
“Today’s customers are increasingly demanding, they expect top quality and peace of mind from their solar systems,” Walters said.
Walters said there has been strong demand for the Maxeon 5 AC panels in Australia and the new Performance 3 AC panel will allow the company to tackle different market segments.
“We are excited about the market potential we are unlocking with this platform and are convinced that these products will help drive accelerated adoption of solar energy among homeowners,” he said.
Keera Single, CEO of Australian solar power provider Solargain, said the AC modules have had early success in Australia.
“SunPower AC Energy Solutions offer a unique solution to customers who may have not been qualified for a conventional string system, so it’s a great opportunity for us to reach new customers,” she said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/19/hydrogen-fired-gas-turbines-vs-lithium-ion-storage/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 19, 2021",Hydrogen-fired gas turbines vs. lithium-ion storage,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have conducted techno-economic analysis to assess the potential competition between hydrogen-fired gas plants and large scale lithium-ion storage in the role of replacing gas-fired thermal power plants in the United States, and have found that lithium-ion batteries may be the most efficient solution in terms of costs, although hydrogen may represent a viable alternative in certain cases.
According to their findings, which can be found in the paper Techno-economic analysis of balancing California’s power system on a seasonal basis: Hydrogen vs. lithium-ion batteries, published in Applied Energy, hydrogen-fired gas turbines (HFGTs) can currently be built at a cost of $1,320/kW and may replace natural gas-fired plants to balance the electricity network on a seasonal basis. Maintenance cost for HFGTs is assumed to be the same as that of gas-fired gas plants, at around $13/kW, per year, while transport costs for hydrogen are estimated at between $0.60/kg, for a 1,000km pipeline, to $2/kg for a 3,000km pipeline.
Furthermore, the MIT scientists calculated that green hydrogen can currently be produced at a cost ranging between $3 and $10 per kilogram, depending on operating conditions, while grey or blue hydrogen can be generated at a cost of $1 and $1.50 per kilogram, respectively. “Assuming 40% utilisation of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser and an input power cost of $10/MWh, green hydrogen can be produced at $5/kg,” they specified. “Green  hydrogen is currently more expensive than grey or blue hydrogen but these costs are projected to decrease on the order to 70% through 2050 as demand increases.”
As for lithium-ion storage, the academics estimated that a 100 MW/400 MWh battery may be built at a cost of $236.50/MWh.
The U.S. group compared the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of HFGTs and large scale lithium-ion storage in a scenario in which the two sources of energy have to meet the production achieved by natural-gas-fired gas turbines in California in 2019. It also assumed that the lifetime of any installed project is 15 years and the discount rate for any installed project is 10%. “The annual fuel consumption for the HFGT is calculated as the total cost associated with purchasing hydrogen to operate the facility, while the annual fuel consumption for the lithium-ion [facility] is equal to the total cost of the electric power stored in the system,” it further explained.
The analysis showed that the competitiveness of HFGTs is strictly dependent on the heat rate of the gas power plants they should replace. The heat rate indicates a power plant’s efficiency and represents the amount of energy it needs to generate a kilowatt-hour of electricity. According to the researchers, HFGTs become more competitive than lithium-ion storage when the heat rate is higher. Furthermore, they found that HFGTs powered by blue hydrogen produced with CO2 capture may be the more cost-competitive substitute for natural-gas-fired gas turbines. “We found the power prices in today’s market do not justify investment in this technology,” they concluded. “However, we noted the propensity for more extreme power price patterns within the market as the share of variable renewable energy grows within the market.”

Australia could hit 4 GW of rooftop PV this year, even amid Covid-19 movement restrictions, according to Steve Blume, president of solar, storage and smart energy trade body the Smart Energy Council (SEC).
The SEC chief was speaking at a two-day event organised by the Washington DC-based Global Solar Council which acts as an umbrella body for national solar associations.
Blume said Australia had witnessed 22% growth in its rooftop solar rate in 2019, with 2.2 GW installed; and that figure rose to 3.3 GW of rooftop panels last year with a further 30% rise in volume in the first half of this year.
The SEC president said the 40.5 GW of rooftop solar in Australia equates to 600 W of solar per person, per day, nationwide.
Stephan Singer, senior climate science and global energy policy advisor at the Bonn-based Climate Action Network group of civil societies, said it was time for the world’s wealthiest countries to prioritise driving down emissions above ever-expanding GDP.
“Rich countries such as Germany, Belgium, and [other] countries in Europe do not need economic growth,” he told the two-day Global Solar Council event. “They need to learn to leverage on what they have and change from fossil fuels and nuclear to renewables and solar PV.”
The event was organised with the help of trade body SolarPower Europe and backed by EU investment entity Get.Invest.
