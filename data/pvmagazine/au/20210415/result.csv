In its application, ARP said an estimated 230,000 solar PV modules will be installed on a 170-hectare site just south of Morwell in the Latrobe Valley. The facility is expected to generate enough electricity to power 23,000 average Victorian households a year, saving more than 146,500 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.
The solar farm will be spread across two sites located less than one kilometre from the defunct coal-fired Hazelwood Power Station. The sites will link via an underground cable and the solar farm will connect to the grid via another underground cable to the nearby Morwell Terminal Station.
ARP director George Hughes said the company had identified the site three years ago and proximity to the grid and associated infrastructure was one of the main reasons for choosing the location.
“Latrobe Valley’s legacy of coal-fired power generation has left an abundance of grid connection infrastructure in the district,” he said.
“The site has been chosen due to its proximity to the Morwell Terminal Station which is where the point of connection will be made.”
The Latrobe Valley has long been considered the heart of Victoria’s coal country and is home to four coal-fired power stations including the decommissioned Hazelwood, Loy Yang A, Loy Yang B and Yallourn.

Hazelwood was shuttered in 2017 and its demolition is expected to be complete by 2023. Owner Energie also operates the Loy Yang B power station while AGL owns Loy Yang A and Energy Australia owns Yallourn. AGL has flagged closing its facility by 2048, while Energy Australia has set a closing date of 2032.
Hughes said the Morwell Solar Farm would help “fill the void” left by the decommissioned coal-fired power stations.
“The Latrobe Valley area has played a key role in Victoria’s power generation and ARP wish to continue this with producing modern, clean, green renewable power,” he said.
“Hazelwood has been switched off, and Yallourn will be switched off, this is a much-needed development, we need many of these projects to fill the gap left by coal-fired power stations.”
Hughes said the solar farm would also help hit the Victorian Renewable Energy Target in which calls for 50% of the state’s electricity to be supplied from renewables by 2030.
“The project will have a substantially positive impact on the environment and the local area and we believe it will be great for the Latrobe Valley,” he said.

The proposed sites are currently being used for grazing and it’s expected this will continue should the project go ahead.
“We’re looking to have as little impact as possible and work with what is already there,” Hughes said when the project was first mooted.
“We don’t want to remove any agricultural productive land, so we looked for grazed land and identified a site which is grazed and will continue to be grazed throughout the life of the project.
“Sheep can be beneath the panels. That is very important, not removing the land from production.”
Hughes said he hoped the approvals would be finalised by August for construction to start early next year. It is expected the solar farm will create about 100 jobs in the 12-month construction period as well as a number of part-time jobs once it was operational.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/15/genex-powers-ahead-with-250-mw-pumped-hydro-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 15, 2021",Genex powers ahead with 250 MW pumped hydro project,"Genex Power announced on Thursday it had reached finance document contractual close after securing $660 million in external financing for the 250 MW/2 GWh pumped hydroelectric energy storage (PHES) facility to be built alongside the existing 50 MW Kidston Solar Farm in far north Queensland.
Sydney-based developer Genex had already secured a $610 million debt facility from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) and a $47 million project grant funding agreement from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and the EPC contractors McConnell Dowell Constructors and John Holland Group joint venture.
The final piece of the financing puzzle was a $3 million variation deed to the loan note subscription agreement it secured from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC).
The financing package, in conjunction with Genex’s fully underwritten fundraising of $115 million in late March, means the project is now fully funded and the company said construction is set to commence this month.
“Following execution of the construction documentation for the Kidston Pumped Storage Hydro Project, I am delighted that we have now executed all outstanding finance documents and, in doing so, secured all of the funding required to construct the Project,” Genex CEO James Harding said.
“We look forward to updating the market when we commence construction at the Kidston site toward the end of this month.”

The PHES facility, to be built at the site of the abandoned Kidston Gold Mine, is part of the Kidston Clean Energy Hub which comprises the already operational 50 MW solar farm. Genex has declared there is the potential for further multi-stage wind and solar projects.
The 250 MW PHES facility was initially scheduled to reach financial close in 2019 but has struck some roadblocks but is now on track to become the first pumped hydro plant to be built in Australia in almost 40 years, and the first to be used specifically to support the integration of variable renewable energy generation from solar and wind.
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said the project would provide reliable, dispatchable and affordable renewable energy to the grid.
“This is a landmark project for all involved and paves the way for renewables to play a larger role in Australia’s electricity grid,” he said.
“Genex will be delivering the first pumped hydro project in Australia since 1984 and the first to be used solely for energy storage and generation rather than water management.”
NAIF CEO Chris Wade said he was delighted the “transformational” project had reached contractual close.
“I congratulate the Genex team for successfully bringing together the parties required to develop this project and we look forward to continuing our partnership as they work towards construction and delivering the significant economic and employment benefits to the region,” he said.
The project is part of more than 400 MW of renewable energy and storage projects Genex has in development.
The 50 MW Jemalong Solar Project in New South Wales was energised in early December and commissioning is now underway. Genex is also developing a 50 MW/75 MWh standalone battery energy storage system at Bouldercombe in Queensland.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/15/south-australia-unveils-new-export-limits-for-rooftop-solar/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,INSTALLATIONS,INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 15, 2021",South Australia unveils new export limits for rooftop solar,"SA Power Networks (SAPN) has announced it will give new rooftop solar PV customers in some congested areas of the network the choice of a flexible solar export arrangement with a limit of up to 10 kW or a firm 1.5 kW export limit as part of a new trial tipped to be implemented within months.
South Australia households are currently restricted to a limit of 5 kW of export capacity but SAPN said the new flexible exports arrangement would allow for better integration of rooftop PV into the energy system as it looks to double the amount of solar on the state network by 2025.
The rapid uptake of rooftop PV in Australia has led to increasing network congestion and reliability concerns, prompting some electricity distributors in other states to introduce reduced or zero export limits in some areas, and SAPN said these will soon need to be trialled in some of Adelaide’s southern suburbs.
SAPN said the network in some areas is already nearing maximum capacity for solar exports, causing customer inverters to trip off or ramp down, and triggering voltage issues for other non-solar customers nearby. The distributor said without mitigating action, this has the potential to overload or damage network equipment, which may lead to blackouts.
The state last year introduced new inverter standards which allows for rooftop solar installations to be switched off remotely to protect the grid. That was actioned for the first time last month when energy authorities switched off thousands of rooftop solar installations on instruction from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) when electricity demand plunged to a near-record low.
SAPN said about 800 customers are expected to be affected by the new export arrangements. The electricity distributor said the trial will not yet impact existing customers, or those connecting or upgrading their systems in a part of the network that is not congested but it is expected the arrangement will eventually apply to all customers.
SAPN strategy and transformation general manager Mark Vincent said the initiative, which is part of an Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) funded trial, will mean more South Australians will have the opportunity to install solar and gain the benefits.
“Obviously, the outcome for individual customers depends on a host of factors and customers should talk to their solar installer about the specific benefits,” he said.

Vincent said the decision on where to introduce flexible exports would be based on local network and substation capacity.
“At this stage, a few localised areas serviced by substations in the southern suburbs are most likely to be involved, initially as part of an ARENA-funded trial. However, over time, we plan to expand the service so that all customers can get access to flexible export limits if they wish,” he said.
Under the flexible exports option, customers will have an export limit of up to 10 kW per phase, based on SAPN’s assessment of network capacity in the area in which the customer is located. Exports will be monitored and controlled through internet-connected smart inverters.
SAPN said customers will most of the time have the opportunity to export more than they would on a lower fixed export limit, subject to the size of their installation and consumption patterns, even in highly overloaded parts of the network. Export limits will only be lowered when necessary to avoid overloading the network and to help maintain a reliable electricity supply.
The flexible export arrangement, which received funding as part of ARENA’s Advancing Renewables Program, will see SAPN team with Victorian-based AusNet Services and inverter manufacturers, Fronius, SMA, and SolarEdge, and energy management software company SwitchDin to develop the technical capability needed to offer customers flexible rather than fixed export limits for solar.
Mike Stone, from the Clean Energy Council and chair of the Solar Industry Reference Group, which is working with SAPN on introducing the flexible exports initiative, said the distributor had shown a “genuine desire” to support the uptake of solar in South Australia.
“The flexible exports option is a lot smarter than imposing lower or zero fixed export limits in overloaded areas, as has happened interstate,” Stone said.
“In the long run it will mean more South Australians will be able to invest in and benefit from solar.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/15/debate-on-alleged-forced-labour-in-chinese-pv-industry-heats-up-in-europe/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,NETHERLANDS,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 15, 2021",Debate on alleged forced labour in Chinese PV industry heats up in Europe,"From pv magazine Global
Members of the Dutch parliament from the centre-right Christian democratic party (CDA), the Social-democratic party (PvdA), and the Green political parties (GroenLinks) have submitted a series of questions on the alleged use of forced labour in the Chinese solar industry to the Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, Sigrid Kaad.
The request for a hearing on the matter follows the publication of an article published by Dutch financial newspaper Financieele Dagblad (FD), in which the forced labour issue was addressed.
In their 21 questions, the MPs urged the government to explain if it is aware that solar modules imported from China, and used in the Dutch PV market, may contain raw materials from the Xinjiang region, in which the large-scale extraction of polysilicon allegedly involves forced labour.
They also called on the government to check if solar products related to the Xinjiang region may have been used in projects receiving public subsidies and invited the minister to explain the possible consequences for Dutch and European renewable energy markets if the imports of modules linked to the Xinjiang region may be stopped or suspended temporarily.
Moreover, the minister was asked to explain what it is being done at the national and EU level for the regional diversification of the global PV industry and to what extent it is possible for Dutch companies, which claim they are only aware of what is happening at the factory level where wafers, cells and modules are produced, to control what is happening in raw material production.
The MPs also urged the government to verify the trustworthiness of consulting firm Horizon Advisory, which published a report in January where it claimed that forced labour is being used in the Chinese PV supply chain. Since its publication, a discussion about the matter has begun in western countries and the existence and extent of the alleged forced labour in Xinjiang have been examined. However, to date, there are still many unknowns about the matter.
Going back to the Netherlands, it is interesting to note that the CDA division of North Holland, in a separate development, has urged the government of the region – an area with strong development of solar parks – to consider the possibility of introducing legislation for ethical purchasing in the PV sector.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/15/fraunhofer-ise-develops-front-back-solar-cell-with-26-0-efficiency/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 15, 2021",Fraunhofer ISE sets record efficiency for front/back solar cell,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) have demonstrated a p-type back junction (BJ) front/back‐contacted (FBC) crystalline silicon solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 26.0% and a fill factor (FF) of 84.3%.
Presented in the study Design rules for high-efficiency both-sides-contacted silicon solar cells with balanced charge carrier transport and recombination losses, recently published in nature energy, the device demonstrates the high performance of the reported back junction solar cell design with a full-area p-n-junction at the back surface, according to the scientists. “Currently, we are working on commercial production technologies to realise such cells at low cost,” research co-author, Armin Richter, told pv magazine.
The cell was built with a full-area passivating contact based on Fraunhofer ISE’s TOPCon technology at the back surface and a highly transparent front surface based on dielectric passivation layers. Compared to conventional industrial cells with a front side p–n junction, the cell features a p–n junction at the back surface in the form of a full-area polycrystalline silicon-based passivating contact.
“The very high FF (84.3%) of this cell, achieved without any full-area conductive layers at the front surface, proves the very effective charge carrier transport in the c-Si bulk to the local front-side contacts,” the paper notes. The cell also showed open-circuit voltage values of up to 732 mV.
The BJ approach, the researchers went on to say, was key to avoid the use of a conductive front surface layer. On the other hand, they also explained, the lateral current transport to the local front contacts is ensured by the crystalline silicon wafer, as it is a majority carrier transport with its inherent high conductivity.
The German group conducted a power-loss analysis which highlighted that the cell is able to balance electron and hole transport losses as well as transport and recombination losses, and concluded that the device exhibited some of the highest performance figures reported for FBC c-Si solar cells to date. “This study demonstrates the potential of these BJ solar cells as a candidate for future c-Si solar cells with efficiencies in the range of 27%, which are expected to play an important role in the next decade,” the researchers stated.
