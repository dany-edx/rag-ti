Previously known as the Melton Renewable Energy Hub, the project was first unveiled in August 2021 by Melbourne-based Syncline. The original design featured a 600 MW/2,400 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) backed by a 12.5 MWp solar farm to supply the battery’s ancillary cooling loads and ensure low cost, ‘net-zero’ operations. But Equis, which assumed full control of the project earlier this year, has since rebranded and resized the big battery.
The MREH, to be built on a 90-hectare site just 25 kilometres northwest of Melbourne, has been boosted to include a 1,200 MWh battery system while the storage capacity will remain at 2.4 GWh. The massive facility will connect to the National Electricity Market (NEM) via the state’s main 500 kV transmission link and will collect excess energy, store it and then release it back into the grid to satisfy demand.
Equis said it is expected the battery will be capable of stabilising about 1.6 GW of solar power or 1.2 GW of wind generation.
“Fully developed, MREH will be … the largest such system in Australia and Asia,” the company said. “MREH is Australia’s only BESS above 200 MW in capacity that connects to the NEM’s high voltage 500 kV transmission system, allowing a volume of electricity to be rapidly dispatched unmatched by other battery storage systems.”

The MREH, which has received all necessary planning approvals after being fast tracked by the Victorian government as a ‘project of state significance’, will be rolled out in two 600 MW stages with construction of the first phase scheduled to begin in early 2023 with operations anticipated to commence in 2024.
The battery project will utilise lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry batteries provided by Finnish technology group Wartsila.
Equis said the MREH had been “uniquely developed” with six separate 200 MW points of connection to the NEM, allowing the battery to satisfy different uses and grid responses simultaneously. The company said the project has been designed with innovative inverter technology to support the transmission grid’s voltage and frequency and replace ‘system inertia’ that is lost when coal and gas-fired power stations retire over the next decade.
“The scale and uniqueness of MREH’s approvals and development mean it will be capable of providing both short and long-hour storage and response services catering to the changing demands of the National Electricity Market,” Equis Managing Director David Russell said.
Equis anticipates the project will also facilitate the development of a large-scale battery recycling hub and hydrogen production facility.
Syncline, which is to remain involved with the project until major construction starts, said the battery is ideally sited because of its proximity to the main 500 kV line and expects the positioning will allow it to support Victoria’s Murray River, Western Victoria and South Victoria renewable energy zones.
Victorian government
“Four years ago, Syncline combed Victoria for the ideal location to build a large-scale grid storage battery which would partially replace the state’s ageing fleet of coal generation plants,” Syncline Managing Director Phil Galloway said. “We needed enough space to operate safely and to minimise the impact on the community. It also had to be at the metropolitan load centre, to ensure that we could improve the reliability and resilience of the grid and materially support regional wind and solar energy.
“Finally, we had to connect at 500kV to deliver the volume of energy that is required when Australia’s large thermal generators retire over the next 10 years. MREH was the ideal location.”
The MREH project is just one of a 39 renewable energy, battery storage and waste infrastructure projects worth more than $6.5 billion that Equis, which is backed by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, said it is currently developing in Australia.
While the MREH is the biggest of its battery projects, Equis has also announced plans to develop a 300MW/1,200MWh battery near Tamworth in New South Wales, a 200 MW/800 MWh energy storage system near Brinkworth in South Australia and two battery projects totalling 250 MW in Queensland.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/18/energy-supply-deal-to-deliver-solar-projects-on-nsw-south-coast/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 18, 2022",Energy supply deal to deliver solar projects on NSW South Coast,"Melbourne-based energy retailer Flow Power has committed to delivering “multiple” new clean energy projects in the New South Wales (NSW) South Coast region after penning a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Shoalhaven, Kiama and Shellharbour councils.
The 10-year PPA, to take effect from Jan. 1, 2023, will see Flow Power supply the councils with renewable electricity from wind and solar farms in regional NSW. The renewable power will be used to cover the operation of council facilities including pools, administration buildings, street lighting, and treatment plants.
The agreement will also anchor the development of multiple new clean energy projects for the region with Flow Power to deliver at least two solar projects totalling more than 8 MW projects on council-owned land.
“This energy deal delivers on our collective mission to create a renewable energy future, together with people and communities,” Flow Power General Manager of Energy Solutions Jacob Mahoney said. “The ability to choose your generators is key to bringing more renewables online and we are privileged to be able to make that happen for these councils.”
The renewable energy will be initially sourced from the Bomen and Cootamundra solar farms in the NSW Riverina region and the 270 MW Sapphire Wind Farm near Glenn Innes in the state’s north.
Flow Power said the 120 MW Bomen Solar Farm will be used as a renewable energy “bridge” until the new local renewable projects are completed and supplying energy to the grid.

The councils said they expect the energy supply deal will enable them to unlock further value from assets such as their water treatment facilities and control energy usage to help manage costs, improve local grid stability, and encourage more renewable development by concentrating their energy use during times of high renewable generation.
Amanda Findley, mayor of Shoalhaven City Council which has already collaborated with Flow Power on the development of a 3.9 MW solar farm in the region, said the PPA would also help council to achieve its net-zero targets.
“Our increased commitment to renewable energy will see Shoalhaven Council cut net carbon emissions by around 15,000 tonnes a year from 2025 and help us achieve our sustainability commitments,” she said. “The construction of two new regional solar farms with Flow Power will also provide local employment and educational opportunities for the community.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/18/rooftop-solar-powers-wa-to-renewable-energy-record/,"MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 18, 2022",Rooftop solar powers WA to renewable energy record,"The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has confirmed the new record for instantaneous renewable energy share was set at approximately 12.30 local time on Nov. 12, with rooftop solar contributing more than 61% of the total electricity generated in Western Australia’s (WA) main grid, the South West Integrated System (SWIS).
“Renewables supplied nearly 40% of total electricity generated in WA’s WEM last week, also setting a new instantaneous renewables record of 81% on Saturday, up 1.3% from the previous record,” AEMO said in a tweet.
“At the time, rooftop PV was estimated to contribute over 61% of underlying demand.”

AEMO said the new peak easily eclipsed the previous benchmark of 79% set in September, 2021.
The result is further evidence of the rapid change the WA energy system has undergone in recent years. Households have embraced renewable energy technology at record rates with approximately 3,000 homes installing rooftop solar each month.
Data provided by the government shows that in 2021, WA households added 191 MW of generation capacity to their rooftops, bringing the total amount of residential solar capacity in the state’s main grid to almost 2 GW of renewable energy generation.
More than 400,000 WA homes and businesses, about 36% of customers, now have PV systems connected to the SWIS, which is the state’s main grid, covering the south-western part of WA. That collective capacity means rooftop solar is the largest source of electricity generation in the state, far outstripping the capacity of state-owned generator Synergy’s 854 MW coal-fired Muja Power Station.
And it makes sense for WA residents to be tapping into solar as the state enjoys more sunshine than any other state or territory in the country. Bureau of Meteorology data shows that Perth, the state capital averages 8.8 hours of sunlight a day, eclipsing the likes of Darwin (8.5 hours), Brisbane (8.2 hours) and Adelaide (7.7 hours).

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/18/is-hydrogen-about-to-have-its-solar-moment/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"NOVEMBER 18, 2022",Is hydrogen about to have its solar moment?,"Longi Green Energy, the world’s largest solar panel producer, has been instrumental in driving solar to become the “cheapest energy in history,” according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The company is now joining a wide field of competitors as it sets its sights on hydrogen electrolysers.
Looking at the confluence of technological breakthroughs and rapidly growing investments in hydrogen, one cannot help but wonder if the price of the world’s lightest energy storage medium might soon collapse, much like the price of solar cells.
BloombergNEF’s hydrogen market outlook recently published a chart showing what looks to be the beginning of a dramatic S-curve. Remember – everyone underestimates the rate of change.

Longi expects to have 85 GW of solar module assembly capacity built by the end of the year.  pv magazine briefly conversed with Longi at RE+, where we asked the company about its green hydrogen plans.
The company has launched three electrolyser models.  At the company’s booth it was suggested that the 5 MW alkaline water electrolytic bath – the LHy-A1000 – was the most efficient of the three models. The unit generates approximately 90 kg of hydrogen per hour.

Longi said it hopes to expand its Wuxi manufacturing facility to 1.5 GW by the end of 2022, and to produce 5 GW to 10 GW of electrolysers by 2025. These targets imply a growth of multiple gigawatts per year.
The company began thinking hard about hydrogen in 2018, as wind and solar prices plummeted, and renewables expanded massively across China. Since electricity comprises 60% of the cost of producing hydrogen, excess solar was thought to be the perfect partner.
Meanwhile demand for net-zero industrial processes has been looming. Longi cited some of the key industries: cement, fertiliser, and oil refinement.
At its booth, pv magazine pried for pricing data for Longi’s electrolysers, asking whether they were below $1,000/kW. The company replied that their products cost less than $500 per kW. Bloomberg NEF recently reported that alkaline electrolysers produced by an unnamed Chinese manufacturer were less than one-third the price of those manufactured in the United States, at only $343/kW.
Because Longi is the largest producer of electrolysers, it is likely to be the manufacturer of the $343 electrolyser. However, since six companies are already producing more than 1 GW of capacity each year (per the chart, below), we’re not sure who is leading these cost reductions.

Bloomberg NEF’s analysis also predicts that we should expect an additional 30% reduction in costs due to scaling by 2025, though some of those gains will be offset by increases to the price of labour and commodities.
This scaling process is still in its early stages, so it is still very likely that the 20% price decrease, (associated with each doubling of capacity), should greatly outpace the relatively small increases to labor pricing that can be expected. External forces are playing a strong role in these developments, too. The Inflation Reduction Act in the USA pays $3/kg for green hydrogen. And as other forces cause energy pains, like the war in Ukraine, it appears likely that manufacturers will find new markets for these components.

It reportedly has a 13% higher efficiency than similar devices with the same materials at the research level.
“This technology is directly transferable to real production,” researcher Basudev Pradhan told pv magazine. “Few solar companies are already making perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells which are on the verge of commercialization. We believe all perovskite tandem solar cells also can be manufactured commercially without being much dependent on costly silicon wafers.”
The researchers used SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, which is a simulation tool for thin-film solar cells developed by the University of Ghent in Belgium.
“Through this software, different types of solar cells can be configured by varying up to seven layers for which simulation is carried out under both dark and illumination conditions of AM 1.5G 1 sun spectrum,” they said.
In order to make the simulation more realistic, they also considered bulk defects in all the layers and interface defects between layers. They built the cell with a top perovskite cell featuring a wide bandgap of 1.75 eV and a bottom perovskite cell with a bandgap of 1.25 eV.
The top cell is designed with an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, a hole transport layer (HTL) based on copper(I) oxide (Cu2O), a perovskite layer, a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, and tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer. The bottom cell relies on an ITO substrate, a hole-transporting material (HTM) based on PEDOT:PSS, a perovskite material, an electron acceptor made of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a SnO2 buffer layer, and a metal contact made of silver (Ag).
Simulated under standard illumination conditions, the top cell exhibited an efficiency of 12.37%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.806 V, a short-circuit current of 18.30 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 83.91%. The bottom cell achieved an efficiency of 19.93%, which brought the overall tandem device to 32.3%. The scientists said this compares to an efficiency of 23.72%, as achieved in similar devices built with the same materials at the research level. The tandem cell also has an open-circuit voltage of 2.047 V, a short-circuit current of 18.30 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 86.23%.
“This simulation work provides insights into quantifying PV parameters limitation and understanding interdependency of one upon another with respect to device performance,” the academics explained. “It also helps in finding an optimised value of various device layer thicknesses along with ETL-HTL combination and its relation with device performance.”
“We haven’t made an accurate cost estimation of the solar cell so far,” Pradhan said. “But the LCOE for perovskite modules built with this cell technology is definitely lower than the present mainstream crystalline silicon-based modules.”
The research team presented the solar cell tech in “All-perovskite two-terminal tandem solar cell with 32.3% efficiency by numerical simulation,” which was recently published in Materials Today Sustainability.
“This work provides a new direction for experimental realisation with higher power conversion efficiency and establishes a new route toward the development of all-perovskite tandem solar cells,” the group concluded.

According to ITRI, 96% of the materials in the module can be recovered, including all of the solar cells and encapsulation glass.
“The cells can be restored to the bare silicon wafer via a reverse dismantling process, and then produced into regenerated cells for use in the manufacturing chain of PV modules,” ITRI’s R&D team told pv magazine.

The two entities claim their technology improves on the traditional module structure, which uses thermoset ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) or polyolefin (PO) as encapsulants. These bond materials tightly together, complicating their separation during the recycling process.
By contrast, their new solution uses a thermoset EVA/PO and thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) bi-layered compound as encapsulation material. The bi-layer serves as a buffer, protecting the cells from cracking during the dismantling process. The solution also takes advantage of the melting point of TPE when the module is heated for disassembly.
“The designed low-temperate thermal process gradually decomposes the bi-layer film,” the R&D team said. “By the time the solar modules become obsolete, the module can be easily dismantled into various parts.”
Unlike the processing of commercial-use modules, ITRI says the improved process recovers glass and silicon wafers as a whole, rather than as pellets. It claims that this allows for silver to be extracted from the intact solar wafers.
The R&D team estimates that the technology increases the value of recycling PV modules from around $18 million to $74 million per gigawatt. The manufacturing process is purportedly the same as for standard modules.
ITRI developed the technology, while URE was responsible for the design and production. The module is in compliance with the IEC 61215 and IEC 61730 safety and reliability standards, certified by TÜV Rheinland.
