Last Friday, the Board published its long awaited ‘options’ for achieving this, promptly stirring outcry with its proposal of what essentially amounts to a subsidy for coal-fired power stations.
Today, in the first briefing regarding the Post 2025 Market Design Options Paper, Dr Kerry Schott, the Board’s Independent Chair, minced no words.
“Australia really is in a situation where we don’t have a lot of options,” she said, frankly. “It’s going to be a bit messy through this next decade or so.”
Her comment was in response to a question building on the estimation that Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) can only maintain its reliability with a renewables penetration of no more than 75%. The key question then is how does Australia handle this.
Energy Security Board
Naturally, clean energy advocates want to see the system shored by green technologies only – a position not lost on Schott. Unfortunately, the required technology and infrastructure is simply not yet there and in the interim, we need a Plan B, she outlined. Which is why the Board is proposing what it’s calling a “physical certificate scheme” for reliability.
“I know a lot of people people hate this – but [it’s being proposed to] leave open some management of [coal station] exits so that we can actually keep the system going while its occurring,” Schott said.
Essentially, Schott posited that the pathway as a means to “keep everything together while the technology catches up.”
“As coal leaves the system, it will be replaced by a mixture of pumped hydro and gas. That gas won’t necessarily run all the time, but will certainly be available to come up when its needed, and similarly with pumped hydro.”
“In due course, we will have hydrogen to complement the gas and possibly in due course replace it altogether,” she added.
Big grid-stabilising batteries are another touted clean energy favourite. While Schott noted that big batteries are proving economically lucrative and are certainly helpful for stabilising the grid, she said their limited durations mean that, as it stands, they just aren’t a viable replacement.
“[Batteries have a] duration at the moment that’s largely limited to about four hours and that will not be sufficient to get us through… so we do need backup,” she said.
The Board’s coal ‘subsidy,’ Schott said, is as its core about ensuring there is an “orderly” exit of traditional generators. This is especially important as coal becomes increasingly unviable economically (wind and solar power is now cheaper than coal), a fact which has already led numerous plants to announce early closures.

While the Board’s “physical certificate scheme” or coal-subsidy pathway has proven the most controversial and therefore received the most attention during the briefing, its Options Paper focussed on another three key areas in addition to coal-station retirements. Those include system security, the integration of distributed energy resources, and transmission and grid congestion.
Schott noted these focus areas are at very different stages of development. “The whole Distributed Energy Resources space is still very undeveloped and it’s an area where we need more work on going forward,” Schott said. On the other hand, the Chair noted system security was in a “pretty good” position with clear solutions.
Transmission line rules, she said, were a constant source of complaint, describing financial transmission rights and regional pricing rules as “close to satanic.”
“There are problems in that space that do need to be tackled,” she said. “If you’ve got any better ideas, let us know!”
This sentiment was repeated by each of the Board experts who spoke at the briefing, all of which stressed that feedback is not only welcome but encouraged.
Schott noted that Australia is “clearly” already on a trajectory towards a high penetration of renewables – the scenario the Australian Electricity Market Operator called, in its Integrated System Plan, a ‘step change.’
“If anything, we have more renewables than that,” Schott said. “But people don’t always want to hear it, for one reason or another.”

This fact, while wonderful for decarbonisation, means that Australia is catapulting into what David Swift, the Board’s Deputy Chair, described as an “overall more complicated system” – which urgently needs addressing but equally has no neat resolutions.
The publication of the Board’s Options Paper on Friday marked the beginning of the final feedback stage before the Board makes its recommendations to government ministers in the middle of the year.
Following these recommendations, the Energy Security Board is set to disband. The question of whether that’s a good idea was also put to Schott during question time, to which she replied “I don’t actually have a strong view about it.”
Schott said market bodies are currently working well together. Nonetheless, the question remains as to whether the Board is necessary to “corral the cats,” as Schott put it, or if they can be left to their own devices now that a plan has been laid out.
This, Schott said, is a decision for ministers, who she expected will consider the issue in the second half of this year and not a minute earlier.

Supported by $80 million of government money, the company is describing it as Australia’s first “net zero emissions” hydrogen and gas capable power plant.
The peaking station, which will be called on in times of high electricity demand, will run on a mixture of green hydrogen and natural gas. GE is set to supply the plant’s turbines, which it says will operate on a blend of around 5% green hydrogen.
Given that, EnergyAustralia expects to be buying around 200,000 kilograms of green hydrogen annually from 2025. EnergyAustralia’s Managing Director, Catherine Tanna, said the company plans to undertake engineering studies to increase the amount of hydrogen in the fuel blend to further ‘green’ the peaker plant over time.
Tallawarra B’s greenhouse gas emissions will be “fully offset” over its operational life, Tanna added.
The expansion of EnergyAustralia’s Tallawarra power station with the new hydrogen addition follows an agreement reached with the NSW government, which will see it provide $78 million in funding. The federal government have committed a further $5 million to make the project “hydrogen-ready.”
The Clean Energy Council described itself as “disappointed” with the plan, saying public money should not be used to underwrite fossil fuel generators.
Tallawarra hydrogen and gas power station will be the first dispatchable energy peaker project to be built in the state in over a decade, according to Australia’s Minister for Energy, Angus Taylor.
On Friday, the Energy Security Board published its Post 2025 Market Design Options Paper. In it, the Board highlighted one of the main issues Australia will face as it decarbonises is the loss of dispatchable energy assets, which typically run on fossil fuels. One of the ways it posited smoothing this transition would be to essentially subsidise coal plants to remain open for the sole purpose of providing the National Electricity Market access to dispatchable energy (essentially, electricity on command by way of burning) in periods of high market demand or low renewable output.
Unsurprisingly, the proposal has attracted criticism.
Hydrogen, though, may offer an interesting solution. Unlike other renewable sources, like solar and wind, it is dispatchable and can be stored and called on when needed. In a briefing session about the Options Paper held today, the Energy Security Board’s Chair, Kerry Schott, said that “in due course” hydrogen may well replace natural gas as Australia’s primary dispatchable energy source. As it stands, however, the technology and infrastructure needed for that are not yet available.
In its statement this morning, Angus Taylor’s office said the federal government had “called on the private sector to step up” with plans to provide up to 1,000 MW of dispatchable electricity generation in response to the impending closure of Liddell power plant, one of the country’s largest generators.
So far, it seems EnergyAustralia’s Tallawarra B plant is the first to answer such calls. The plant will provide the state with improved energy security, reliability and flexibility, EnergyAustralia’s Managing Director, Tanna, said.
“Our new open-cycle, hydrogen and gas capable turbine will provide firm capacity on a continuous basis and paves the way for additional cleaner energy sources to enter the system.
“The station will be operating in time for the summer of 2023-24, following the closure of the Liddell power station, and it will help to kick start the green hydrogen industry,” she added.
Tanna announced her retirement last week, becoming the latest in a number of top energy executives to leave their positions in April as transition plans ramp up. 
The NSW state government has also sought reliable electricity supply alternatives as Liddell’s closure draws closer. For instance, it has jointly underwritten a transmission interconnector upgrade between NSW and Queensland, and has also committed $75 million for its Emerging Energy Program to provide grants for new dispatchable generation.
The state’s prominently progressive Minister for Energy, Matt Kean, described the Tallawarra project as setting a “new benchmark for how gas generators can be consistent with NSW’s plan to be net zero by 2050 by using green hydrogen and offsetting residual emissions.”
The Illawarra was built on the back of coal and, as with state’s northern Hunter region, there is growing tension between the need for a clean energy future and the generations of coal miners and coal mining companies which have centuries-long roots in the region.
This year, the Independent Planning Commission (IPC) made a historic decision to block South32’s Dendrobium coal mine extension. The monumental and, for many, shock decision came just months after mining giant Peabody was given the green light to undertake a controversial long-wall mining operation directly below Woronora Dam, a Sydney drinking water catchment area.
The sagas around coal mining extensions being granted by the NSW government even as it targets net zero emissions by 2050 exemplifies Australia’s ongoing strain between necessary future and profitable past. One of the ways governments and industries are seeking to redirect this old loggerheads is by repositioning traditionally coal exporting regions as renewable energy hubs.
In the Illawarra, this includes plans to transform Port Kembla (Wollongong’s port) into a hydrogen hub and exporting epicentre. Presumably, the hope is that both infrastructure and workers can be redeployed in the new industry.
In the instance of EnergyAustralia’s Tallawarra B, the gas and hydrogen power station is expected to contribute $300 million to the economy, create 250 well-paid jobs during construction and power to around 150,000 homes.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/04/victorias-roadmap-to-halve-emissions-by-2030-includes-ev-subsidy-and-renewably-powered-government-operations/,"EV,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 4, 2021",Victoria’s roadmap to halve emissions by 2030 includes EV subsidy and renewably powered government operations,"Yet again, Australian state governments have opted to go it alone on climate change strategies after the Morrison federal government neglected to meet the moment spurred by Biden’s Climate Summit held in April.
On the weekend, Victoria unveiled its long awaited Climate Change Strategy, which includes a $3,000 subsidy for all new zero emissions vehicles which cost less than $69,000. It also announced that its government operations, from schools and hospitals to police stations and metro trains, will be powered with 100% renewable electricity by 2025 – an Australian first.
The state government has pledged $20 million for reducing emissions in the agricultural sector and committed a further $15.3 million for the Victorian Carbon Farming Program, which it says will help farmers store more carbon in shelterbelt trees and engage in agroforestry.
The state has essentially set three 50% targets for 2030, most notably to halve carbon emissions. It has also set a target of 50% of car sales to be net-zero vehicles and for renewables to generate half of the electricity in its grid.
Victoria described its targets as “ambitious, but achievable.”
In the nearer term, the state is seeking to cut emissions by between 28% and 33% by 2025.
“This strategy will keep Victoria on track to meet our target of net zero emissions by 2050, while also seizing the opportunities of climate action – advancing technology, investing in new industries and creating Victorian jobs,” the government said in a statement.
Transport is currently the second-largest and fastest-growing source of emissions in Victoria. Clearly hoping to address this, the state government has committed more than $100 million to transform the sector, offering up to $3,000 to Victorians who buy zero-emissions vehicles (ZEVs).
This includes both electric vehicles as well as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Australia’s automotive market currently doesn’t have any hydrogen fuel cells cars for public sale, but the Australian Hydrogen Council said it hopes the subsidy will help change this.
With the subsidy largely aimed at EVs, funds for additional charging infrastructure is also included in the plan, with the government set to add at least 50 charging points to the existing network of 24 sites. It plans to target major highways and locations across Melbourne city.
“Knowing that more charging infrastructure is on the way sends the right message to potential buyers, and renewable energy will play a crucial role to support the roll out of electric vehicles and to enable a zero-emission electric vehicle fleet,” Clean Energy Council Chief Executive, Kane Thornton, said of the plan.
The government wants half of all new car sales in Victoria to be ZEVs by 2030.
The move stands in stark contrast to the Victorian government’s much-criticised electric vehicle road tax, which in April was called the “worst EV policy in the world” in an open letter signed by 25 companies and organisations.
Within the next five years, Victorian schools, hospitals, police and train stations will all be powered by 100% renewable energy. The commitment is the first of its kind in Australia and will presumably be negotiated largely by Power Purchasing Agreements (PPAs) with renewable projects.
The Clean Energy Council’s Kane Thornton welcomed the move. “Reducing emissions through all government operations will be key in reaching emissions reduction targets and encouraging further investment in clean energy infrastructure,” he said.
He added that the strategy sends the right message to the renewable industry and builds on previous commitments.
While Victoria’s government is adamant that the plan is world leading, a number of experts have pointed out that it is not enough to keep global warming below the agree Paris target of 1.5°C. 
“By announcing targets of 45-50% by 2030, Victoria has almost matched the recent US pledge of 50-52%, but the science is clear we need to act much faster. Judged against what we need to do to stop the climate crisis, these targets fall far short,” Environment Victoria CEO Jono La Nauze said.

Tweed Shire (the Tweed), is looking to reach net zero emissions in its electricity usage by 2030, a feat which is already being pursued with more than 20 Council facilities sporting solar arrays already.
This next phase of REAP will see the Council nearly triple its solar capacity, reaching 2,200 kWp with an expected saving in excess of $220,000 annually.
Tweed Mayor Chris Cherry said it would be through a combination of “energy efficiency works, installation of renewable energy systems, carbon offsets and purchasing renewable energy we are aiming to meet Council’s target of reducing electricity-related carbon emissions by 25% next year (from 2016/17 baseline), 50% by 2025 and to have achieved net zero emissions by 2030.”
The purchase of renewable energy has been underway since October 2020, when Tweed Shire Council announced a 10-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Flow Power. The deal sees Council buy more than 50% of the electricity used to run its larger facilities from wind and solar farms, including the Bomen Solar Farm near Wagga Wagga.
Among the facilities to receive solar arrays as part of REAP’s second phase are the Tweed Regional Gallery, which is currently exhibiting Sidney Nolan’s Ned Kelly Series, and works from the Lismore-born great, Margaret Olley.
Other sites include the Banora Point Community Centre, Tweed Regional Aquatic Centre, Kingscliff Water Pump Station and the Tweed Regional Museum, all soon to be adorned with solar panels.

The South Korean Energy Agency has launched the first of the two PV tenders planned for this year.
In the procurement exercise, the agency intends to allocate 2,050 MW – the largest amount ever tendered by the Korean authorities to date – across five project categories: installations of less than 100 kW; projects ranging in size from 100 to 500 kW; PV arrays with a capacity between 500 kW and 1 MW; solar plants with an installed power of 1 to 20 MW; and, for the first time, solar parks exceeding 20 MW in size.
Selected projects will be awarded a fixed rate under a 20-year contract under the country’s renewable energy certificate (REC) scheme and will sell electricity to local power distributors.
The tender’s final results are expected to be announced on July 16 and the winning bidders should be awarded a final contract in August.
There are currently no domestic content requirements embedded in the tender but, starting from this year, projects relying on solar PV modules with a low carbon footprint are being prioritised.
In the two tenders held in 2020, the KEA allocated 1.2 GW and 1.41 GW, respectively, while in 2019 it contracted 350 MW and 500 MW. In 2017 and 2018, total allocated capacity was 600 MW in each year. Overall, South Korea‘s authorities should tender 4 GW of solar this year.
The country reached an installed solar power capacity of around 15.6 GW as of the end of December 2020. The newly installed PV capacity for 2020 was around 4.1 GW.
South Korea currently plans to install 30.8 GW of solar by 2030.

California-based storage specialist Gridtential Energy has secured around $12 million in funding from a group of investors led by U.S.-based venture capital firm 1955 Capital and has increased, to €28 million (AU$43 million), the capital it raised to date to boost the development of its “Silicon Joule” absorbent glass mat (AGM) battery technology.
“With Silicon Joule, we can use today’s battery manufacturing and recycling facilities to reduce vehicle emissions and put renewable energy storage into homes in high volumes right now,” said the company’s CEO, John Barton.
Gridtential’s flagship product is the lead-acid battery Silicon Joule 24V U1 — Deep-cycle Gen2 Battery, which it defines as the world’s first factory-ready, single-block, 24V, deep-cycle lead battery, and an alternative to lithium-ion batteries.
The 12-cell device measures 198x137x189mm and weighs 9.96kg. It has a nominal voltage of 24 V and a cycle use of 28.8 V, or 2.4 V per cell. The battery also features a maximum discharge current of 45 A and has an expected cycle life of 750 cycles.
Its gravimetric energy density is 40 Wh per kg and its volumetric energy density, 77 Wh per kg. The cycling temperature range is between -30 and 50 degrees Celsius.
The product is claimed to be ideal for personal mobility vehicles such as golf carts, scooters, and e-bikes, as well as for telecom backup and renewable energy storage in homes and offices.
AGM batteries are usually built with a special glass mat separator that absorbs the electrolyte solution between the battery plates. The Silicon Joule 24V U1 battery is manufactured with silicon wafers that are claimed to replace lead grids, to reduce battery weight.
“In conventional battery designs, electrons flow across the battery plate and high current is concentrated at the top contact,” the U.S. start-up explains on its website. “In Gridtential’s bipolar design, current flows through each silicon wafer evenly, making it a highly efficient conductor with a current path length equal to its thickness.”
The silicon wafers are said to reduce lead use by 40% and the battery weight by 30%. “Plus, they maintain the thermal stability and 99% recyclability of the conventional technology, creating a clear safety and sustainability advantage over lithium-ion,” the company said.

The Barcelona municipal authorities have chosen Plaça de Les Glòries Catalanes, a historical square, as the future site of a 50-square-meter demonstration project to test the feasibility of solar pavement. Spain’s Sorigué and Hungary-based Plati developed the winning technology.
The pilot project will be used to assess the potential of solar paving materials. The 340 mm x 340 mm x 61 mm solar panels feature electrical wiring and are covered with a highly resistant, non-slip glass. The modules function as normal urban paving stones that can be walked on. However, they have a combined power capacity of 9 kW.
In this first pilot test, the pavement will power a public bicycle rental service in Barcelona, in order to monitor the energy that is generated in real time. The developers expect to generate 7,560 kWh of electricity per year, which is equivalent to the total energy consumption of three households. A municipal commission will evaluate the results for a period of six months to determine the potential of installing the tech in other parts of the city.
