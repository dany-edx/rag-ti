GSEO, the renewables-focused offshoot of international investment giant Victory Hill Capital Partners, said the battery was commissioned late last month and, subject to authorisation by grid operator South Australia Power Networks (SAPN), is expected to reach full capacity in the coming weeks.
GSEO, which entered the Australian market in 2021 with the $25 million (USD 17 million) purchase of the solar farm at Murray Bridge and another operating 4.95 MW PV asset in Queensland, said the co-location of renewable energy generation with battery energy storage capacity forms a critical part of its investment strategy in Australia.
Victory Hill Capital Partners Co-Chief Investment Officer Richard Lum said the coupling of both technologies will allow for the optimisation of each technology.
“The complexity of managing the grid and ensuring stability when there is already such a high penetration of intermittent solar power generation in Australia is a real challenge,” he said.
“Its demands can only be faced with greater energy storage that will help provide smooth availability of power from renewable sources. Improving stability is also important to avoid curtailment of renewable energy.”
Lum said co-locating battery energy storage systems at GSEO’s Australian solar farms will provide more options to capture positive power price movements, prevent over exposure to negative prices, and allow the company to earn revenues from providing frequency response services to the grid.
The Murray Bridge hybrid project is just the first for GSEO which plans to co-locate battery energy storage systems with up to two hours of capacity at each of its Australian solar farms.
The company said it has already commenced development of a battery at its Queensland solar farm with work on optimising the grid connection of the energy storage system for the site now underway.
GSEO also expects to add battery energy storage systems at three solar projects currently under construction at Coleambally, Narrendera, and Dubbo in western New South Wales.
GSEO said all three 4.95 MW capacity solar farms are expected to be commissioned later this year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/20/brisbane-startup-launches-australian-made-home-ev-charger/,"EV,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 20, 2023",Brisbane startup launches Australian-made home EV charger,"Brisbane-based Evos said the Australian made SB7 charger is compatible with all electric vehicles (EVs) and has been designed to help homeowners to charge their EVs safely and conveniently while also empowering them to make smart energy decisions.
Evos co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Marcelo Salgado said the SB7 charger would connect to an app that allows drivers to monitor the cost of charging and features a built-in energy management system that can be programmed to charge EVs during off-peak periods or to leverage solar or battery power.
The charger is also Wi-Fi connection capable, ensuring Evos and/or the homeowner can monitor and control the charger.
“We asked ourselves what the EV owner needs from a charger,” Salgado said.
“It has to be easy to install with no restrictions as to where it can go on a property, be easy to monitor remotely and help them manage their costs in an era when everyone is concerned with energy prices.”
“And it has to look good.”

The SB7, which will be manufactured in Australia, is the first Evos equipment designed for residential applications after the company released a 22 kW charger for business fleets in 2021.
The charger is expected to be available between September and October, although its price had yet to be determined.
The SB7 charger, and the Fleet Home22 Charger, will be sold through Ampol after Australia’s largest transport fuels provider announced it will serve as the exclusive distributor of Evos’ EV charging hardware.
Ampol Energy General Manager James Myatt said the company had become “acutely away that our customer’s needs are changing” and moved into electricity distribution last year.
Myatt said the deal with Evos would help meet the needs of customers who plan to power up their vehicles outside service stations in future.
“The technology allows us to support customers wherever their journey is, whether they’re starting their journey at home, on the road, wherever they park their cars, or on the way home from work,” he said.
“If people are going to need charging at home, we want to provide the infrastructure to do that.”
Ampol said it will sell EV equipment directly to consumers and potentially through partners such as automotive brand BYD.
Ampol is also investing in public charging points at its petrol stations and intends to install 300 charging bays by 2024.
The launch of the SB7 EV charger comes after Evos earlier this month announced it had completed a funding round, securing $5 million (USD 3.41 million) from existing investors to help commercialise its charging and energy management software technology. The capital raise came after the company initially raised $1.7 million in 2021.

Recycling end-of-life solar panels thoroughly continues to prove a challenge with the individual materials, including glass, silicon, precious metals, wiring and plastic, integrated in such a way that makes them hard to separate. For the process to be viable, components need to be carefully separated to avoid contamination which has proven hard to achieve.
But now a team from the UNSW Process Modelling and Optimisation of Reacting Flow (ProMO) lab, led by Professor Yansong Shen, has announced a new process that allows them to quickly and efficiently sort the individual materials.
The process integrates conventional methods for the separation of large components, such as the aluminium frame and glass sheets, and crushing of the cell but relies on a very highly abrasive separation system to improve the process.
“The key to our new process is the addition of the sieving aids which help to crush the solar cells into smaller particles allowing a better separation of all the components,” Shen said.
“That makes it much easier to recover important elements such as the silver contained in the solar cells.”

The ProMO research team discovered that using stainless steels balls as a sieving aid provided the optimal solution for the process.
“We spent around three or four months working on that element, also testing with sieving aids made of clay or plastic,” team member Chengsun He said. “We can use different size sieving aids for different stages of the process. The main goal is to ensure that all of the PV cells particles can be crushed by the sieving aids, while the glass and other significant material remains intact at the top.”
The entire crushing and sieving process, which occurs inside a vibrating container, takes about 5-15 minutes to effectively separate 99% of the materials.
Once the material has been separated using the new patented process, the team is able to employ a traditional chemical leaching, as well as precipitation to extract the specific elements such as pure silica and silver, which accounts for about 0.05% of the total weight of a panel but makes up approximately 14% of the material value.
Shen said the team is already working with some industry partners “but we would like to engage in more industry collaborations to scale this process up and enhance the economic feasibility of the PV recycling process.”
“Our group of 30 researchers is the largest in Australia working on PV recycling technology development, not lifecycle assessment only, and probably one of the largest in the world,” he said. “This patent is just one part of one recycling process for end-of-life solar panels and we are also working on other solutions to the other steps.”
The International Renewable Energy Agency has projected that the cumulative PV waste volume on a global scale will reach up to eight million tonnes by 2030. And that figure soars to up to 78 million tonnes of waste by 2050 as successive generations of solar panels installed at the start of the century come to their end of life.

The Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) Integrated System Plan projects Australia will need 120 GW of installed solar capacity by 2050, representing a four-fold increase on current capacity.
Delivering this step change in solar capacity will require robust and reliable supply chains but Australia is currently heavily reliant on the availability of solar modules that are predominantly manufactured in China.
Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen said this dependency on a single external source raises concerns about Australia’s control over the solar supply chain and urgent action is required to secure the supply of the inputs into solar panels and find opportunities to reap the benefits of manufacturing at home.
“We’ve put 60 million solar panels on roofs in Australia in the last 10 years. One per cent of them have been made in Australia. We aim to change that,” he said.
“While we’ve been a global leader in solar PV deployment, we rely too heavily on overseas supply for our solar panels, which poses major risks due to production concentration and vulnerabilities in the supply chain.”
Bowen said Australia is well placed to become a major manufacturer of solar panels for the domestic market and an exporter to the rest of the world, noting the country has the required resources, people, and market scale.
“To achieve net zero, the world is going to need more reliable supply chains to meet surging demand for solar panels and Australia has what it takes to be a major supplier,” he said.
“Over 80% of today’s global solar PV manufacturing uses technology developed in Australian laboratories.”
The APVI will work with the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics (ACAP) on the S2S study, which will look at what is needed to establish a domestic manufacturing industry, including technical, commercial, regulatory and social licence issues.
Other industry partners involved in the study include Australia’s only commercial solar panel manufacturer Tindo Solar, solar technology innovators 5B and SunDrive, along with AGL, Aspiradac, Energus and Siemens.
APVI S2S Project Manager Muriel Watt said the study will explore the challenges and opportunities for manufacturing solar panels and components onshore, examine renewable energy export potential, and investigate the policy options required to achieve them.
“We’re excited to be working with industry partners to map out a strategy for Australia to develop local industry opportunities across the solar supply chain,” she said.
The study, which will receive more than $541,000 in grant funding through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), will include a market assessment of domestic and global solar demand and manufacturing capability.
It will also include an economic assessment of the value chain from polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells, module production to end-of-life treatment, to determine whether Australian manufacturing can be globally cost competitive at a scale that meets future PV demand.
The study is expected to be completed by October 2023.

The GEA-BEAC allocated 1,870.8 MW of ground-mounted PV capacity and 90 MW of floating solar power. It also assigned around 10 MW of rooftop PV capacity and 960.28 MW of onshore wind power.
It originally planned to allocate around 11.6 GW of renewable energy capacity, which means the auction was largely undersubscribed.
“The winning bidders were ranked based on their offers from the lowest to the highest bid price and stacked corresponding to the respective [renewable energy] technology per grid,” the authority said in a statement.
The selected developers will secure 20-year power purchase agreements.
In the first procurement exercise in the Philippines, which concluded in June 2022, the authorities allocated 2 GW of renewable energy capacity, with 1.49 GW coming from solar power.
