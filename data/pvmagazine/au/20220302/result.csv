The project would be designed in such a way that hydrogen production could to be scaled up to potentially export the fuel in future.
The energy giant has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Orica to conduct feasibility studies into the facility looking also at downstream value chain opportunities.
The study will assess the ways an industrial hydrogen hub could support meaningful use cases for green hydrogen in the Hunter Valley and beyond, including to supply heavy industry and transport, to blend into natural gas pipelines and potentially be converted into green ammonia at Orica’s existing Kooragang Island manufacturing facility.
Origin flagged the hydrogen could also fuel trucking and passenger bus operations in the Hunter, Central Coast and Greater Sydney regions and further support the NSW government’s goal of having 10,000 fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) by 2030.
The news comes just weeks after Origin announced it would close Australia’s largest coal-fired power station, Eraring, seven years early in 2025. Eraring is also in the Hunter Valley in northern New South Wales – with the new development possibly a way of breathing new hope of jobs into a region historically driven by rapidly-closing coal.

Last week, Origin hit back at some of the press which has unsurprisingly surfaced around its coal plant’s early closure. On its website, it published an open Letter to the Editor of The Australian, slamming Peta Credlin’s article ‘power of the woke cowboy capitalists’.
In her article, Credlin incorrectly stated that Origin had refused a NSW government request to buy or lease Eraring Power Station and keep it operating. Something the company said is absolutely untrue. “Origin did not receive, nor did it reject, any offer to buy or lease Eraring.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/02/organic-battery-progress-brings-adelaide-researchers-tantalisingly-close-to-full-biodegradability/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 2, 2022",Organic battery progress brings Adelaide researchers tantalisingly close to full biodegradability,"Researchers at Adelaide’s Flinders University have developed a 2.8 Volt organic polymer rechargeable battery. While the polymers used in the battery are not yet biodegradable, the team will soon switch to natural polymers like that found in seaweed – an application other Flinders researchers are examining.
The use of polymers in the battery are paramount, though hardly obvious. Plastic (a synthetic polymer) is typically used to insulate and stop electrical currents conducting, so it hardly seems a battery material frontrunner, especially for an electrode. 
How Dr Zhongfan Jia, a senior lecturer in chemistry at Flinders University’s Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, and his team have been able to use polymers is by chemically modifying them at a molecular level, something which they do in two different process to allow both the storage and cycling of energy. (More on this modification process below.)
Currently the Flinders polymer battery has an energy density just under 100mAh/g (milliampere hours per gram), though the team is now working on the next generation and hopes they can double that capacity. If the polymer battery could reach 200mAh/g, Dr Jia says it would bring it in line with the capacity of lithium batteries sold just a few years ago. “That will compete,” Dr Jia told pv magazine Australia.
What motivates the intercontinental researchers is the potential for biodegradable polymer batteries to solve the waste issue of batteries and global reliance on mined, rare materials. Moreover, the batteries could have novel high tech applications as the are flexible and non-toxic, making them suitable for fields like biotech and beyond. “That’s something we only talk about at scientific conferences, not too much to the general public,” Dr Jia said.
“We do know that we cannot completely replace the li-ion battery,” Dr Jia said, pointing to superiority of lithium-ion batteries voltage. “We don’t want to replace the Tesla car battery… but in our daily lives there’s so many small batteries in use that are discarded.” Alongside novel high tech applications, this is where Dr Jia sees the most potential for the batteries, including in things like electric toothbrushes and other rechargeable appliances. Currently his team have 100 to 200 cycles on their battery, though the plan is to reach 1,000.
Polymers and biodegradability
Most polymers used today are synthetic and come from petroleum, but they can also occur naturally in things like seaweed. Dr Gia and his collaborators’ plan is to use “materials directly from nature” in future iterations of the battery. “Next stage is we are trying to make the polymer that can degrade if you discard [the battery] in the environment only from sunshine, water and oxygen… within six months to a year.”
How it would be possible for these natural materials to store and cycle electricity is through, as mentioned, modification. The kind of battery the team has built is called a radical battery, because it uses a stable radical molecule called a TEMPO radical. A small molecule, this TEMPO radical needs to be attached to something, or else it “cannot make a certain shape, they don’t have mechanic force,” Dr Jia said.
Which is where polymers come in. “Polymers can make your chairs, desk, boat, any shape of material that you can make. That’s the beauty of the material,” Dr Jia said. “We are now making this radical on the polymer… because the polymer has the property you can use [to make the battery].”
This is the first polymer modification. The second comes in the battery’s electrode, which Dr Jia describes as “judiciously” designed. “We are now trying to store the energy in polymer,” the researcher said. “To achieve that is really difficult,” he adds, because polymers are not conductive. 
To make it conduct, the polymer has to be mixed with carbon materials on a molecular level. “Only when you do that can you use all your materials to store energy. Otherwise if there’s some aggregation, if the polymers aggregate together, then only the surface can store energy,” Dr Jia said.
“We try to modify the polymer not only with the TEMPO radical to store the energy, but we also modify that polymer with other function and that function can stick on the carbon materials.”
Dr Jia has been working with polymers for over 20 years, but only started researching their use in batteries around six years ago – a period which saw a marked increase in interest in this area. Dr Jia’s team in Adelaide has been working in collaboration with Dr Kai Zhang from the Zhejiang Sci-Tech University in China, who was a PhD student of Dr Jia’s in Australia. The team also collaborates with researchers in Japan, Texas, at the University of Queensland and the Australian National University (ANU). 
In terms of commercialisation, Dr Jia says that is still a way off. The materials needed to make the TEMPO radical are cheap, acetone and ammonium, but creating the radical does require a few steps, Dr Jia explained. “It’s not as expensive as you think, it’s pretty cheap. But of course when you make this into a real material to use for the battery, there’s some stages [for it] to be optimised and I think that’s probably something we need to consider in the following years.”
More details on the inner workings of the battery have been published in the Chemical Engineering Journal.

While the work of adaptation has begun, we have found the progress is uneven and insufficient, given the risks we face.
These findings are from our work as co-authors of the new Australia and New Zealand chapter in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 6th Assessment Report on Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation, released on Monday.
This new report represents the efforts of over 270 climate change experts to review and synthesise the latest information. These authors collectively examined over 34,000 peer reviewed publications about how climate change is affecting ecosystems and societies, future risks, adaptation enablers and limits, and links to climate resilient development.
Climate change is bringing hotter temperatures, more dangerous fire weather, more droughts and floods, higher sea levels, and drier winter and spring months to southern and eastern Australia, amongst other changes. These changes are increasing the pressure on our natural environment, settlements, infrastructure and economic sectors including agriculture, finance and tourism.
In low-lying areas along our coasts, where so many Australians live, homes, infrastructure and ecosystems will be lost to the rising sea if mitigation and adaptation are inadequate.

For our farmers and the agrifood sector, climate change brings unwelcome stresses and disruptions, making it more challenging to produce food profitably and sustainably. Intensified heat and drought will place yet more stress on our rural communities, particularly in Australia’s south-west, south and east.
Australians will experience more deaths and ill health from heatwaves, as will our wildlife.
Unfortunately, that’s not all we have to contend with. We have identified two new types of climate-related risk.
The first are the cascading, compounding and aggregate impacts on our cities and towns, roads, supply-chains and services, emerging from the interaction of disasters like wildfires, floods, droughts, heatwaves, storms and sea-level rise. Think of the rolling impacts from the Black Summer bushfires, which killed people and wildlife, destroyed homes and resulted in major economic losses for tourism, farming and forestry. Or think of the ongoing floods in New South Wales and Queensland.
The second is the slow speed at which governments and institutions are moving to deal with these changing risks, undermining the system-wide adaptation needed. What does this mean in practice? That the scale and scope of what we can expect to see happen may overwhelm our capacity to respond to these impacts – unless we address these risks quickly and strategically.
Climate impacts are powerfully and unevenly amplified by existing stresses affecting our environment and people. For instance, Australia’s coral reefs already face threats from pollution and invasive species. Climate change acts as a threat multiplier.
Climate change will pose more of a threat to vulnerable Australians, such as those with inadequate health care, poor quality housing and unstable employment.

We examined how much the projected damage could be reduced through better adaptation such as changes in policy, more effective planning and technical solutions.
Our ecosystems most at risk are our world-famous coral reefs and the huge biodiversity and ecosystem services they provide. Steadily warming oceans and sudden marine heatwaves have already pushed many areas to the edge.
The Great Barrier Reef is already at a very high risk of crossing a critical threshold where further warming may cause irreversible damage. Between 2016 and 2020, three marine heatwaves struck the Great Barrier Reef, causing major coral bleaching and death. Once the coral is gone, many of the fish and invertebrates do not survive.
In typical conditions, it takes a minimum of a decade for the fastest growing corals to recover from a single bleaching event. We are no longer in typical conditions. Warming beyond 1.5℃ would see marine heatwaves strike more often. Bleaching will go well beyond the reef’s natural ability to regenerate.
If we fail to address underlying vulnerabilities in our society and fail to reduce climate-related risks, we will make climate change impacts even worse and undermine our capacity to adapt, well into the future.
But if we step up adaptation now, we will see benefits both in the near- and long-term. This includes practicalities like making sure all strategic planning, land use planning and infrastructure developments take complex climate change risks into account – in a systematic, rather than siloed, narrowly focused, way.
On the positive side, Australia’s adaptation efforts have increased in ambition, scope and implementation across governments, non-government organisations, businesses and communities since the last IPCC assessment in 2014.
In recent years, Australia has created a government agency for recovery and resilience, a disaster risk reduction framework, and national adaptation guidance.
States and territories have introduced climate adaptation strategies, with some evidence of implementation. Local governments, regions, communities and associated alliances are becoming more active in adaptation. In the private sector, there is some rapid work underway to address climate risk and disclosure.
Laudable though this progress is, we found that progress on adaptation is distinctly uneven. That’s due to implementation barriers as well as limits to adaptive capacity. Barriers we found include competing objectives, divergent risk perceptions and values, knowledge constraints, inconsistent information, fear of litigation, up-front costs, and lack of engagement, trust and resources.
If we are to get better at adaptation, we have to shift from reactive to anticipatory planning, to better plan for and reduce climate-related risks. Systemic risks demand systemic adaptation.
We found there was a great deal to be gained from better integration and coordination between levels of government and sectors through more effective policy alignment and more inclusive and collaborative institutional arrangements.
Australia would benefit from a national risk assessment and a national climate adaptation implementation plan. Other ways to enable more effective adaptation include serious and stable funding and finance mechanisms, and nationally consistent and accessible information and decision-support tools.
The way we go about adaptation is also important. Climate planning that promotes inclusive governance, collective action and mutual support can make the process of change easier, fairer and more effective.
Supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their institutions, knowledge, values and self-determination is especially important. The knowledge, skills and experience held by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is relevant to climate change adaptation across society.
If we delay introducing effective adaptation methods and significant global emission reduction, the damage caused will be more expensive and require far greater change. We need robust, timely adaptation, and deep cuts to emissions.
That’s to have our best chance of keeping global warming to 1.5-2℃ and reduce the challenges of adaptation.
Although the climate impacts and risks we face are increasingly severe, it is by no means too late to avert the worst outcomes.
It is still possible to move to a pathway of “climate resilient development” in which we work together to rapidly contain global warming, adapt effectively and help secure a better future for all.

The Electrochemical Safety Research Institute at Illinois-based safety certification entity Underwriters Laboratories has undertaken a test program with US consultancy Stress Engineering Services (SES) to study the key technical attributes of redox flow batteries made by Australian battery specialist Redflow.
The program will investigate the operating and safety profile of Redflow’s redox flow batteries, their cycle life and aging properties, and will seek to understand how the batteries behave under “off-nominal” conditions of overcharge, over-discharge, and external short-circuits.
The research aims to enhance the knowledge base around the operating and safety characteristics of zinc-bromine flow batteries, enabling interested parties to better understand and compare a broad range of product chemistries.
Six Redflow batteries, bought by Underwriters Laboratories (UL), arrived at an SES facility in Texas in December. The test program started last month.
“As redox flow battery technology evolves, it’s important to determine its safety and performance limits under various conditions,” said Judy Jeevarajan, vice president and executive director of the Electrochemical Safety Research Institute at UL. “Our partnership with Redflow and SES will deepen our understanding of this energy storage alternative.”
Marketed as ZCell and ZBM2 products, Redflow’s 10kWh zinc-bromine flow batteries are designed for deep cycling, long duration stationary storage applications and can tolerate harsh conditions. The two models are the world’s smallest commercially available flow batteries and are scalable from a single system installation through to grid scale deployments.
Last year, Brisbane-based Redflow put the finishing touches to its latest model, the Gen3. The new product has several design changes from the previous two systems, such as a side-by-side tank design and a single, rather than double stack – both of which are expected to reduce production costs, according to the manufacturer.
“With Gen3 we are confident of achieving a 30% reduction in manufacturing costs through supply chain and engineering productivity impacts,” Redflow CEO and managing director Tim Harris said in a statement announcing customer trials of the product 13 months ago.
In an Australian Stock Exchange announcement today, Redflow said it achieved a 172% jump in revenue from July to December. The company said it generated AU$1.2 million (US$867,000) in the six month window and rolled out 2GWh of its zinc-bromine batteries to customers across the United States, South Africa, and Australia.
The manufacturer said its Gen3 ZBM battery remains on track to be introduced into production in the April-to-June period and reported a growing pipeline, including interest in megawatt-hour scale systems.
Over the half-year period, Redflow also completed a 2MWh project in California for Anaergia’s Rialto Bioenergy Facility, its largest single deployment to date. Touted as a significant milestone for the Australian manufacturer, the project is said to provide a “high level of exposure to the US, growing network and global markets”.
“The Anaergia project has generated significant interest in the Redflow solution by US and global corporations and governments, notably by a large US listed corporate who in June named Redflow in a request for information as an approved supplier of flow batteries,” Redflow said today.

European aircraft company Airbus has officially launched its multi-year demonstrator program to test a variety of hydrogen technologies on the ground and in the air. “Today, the A380 MSN1 test aircraft is earmarked for a new role: to take the lead on testing the technologies that will be vital to bringing the world’s first zero-emission aircraft to market by 2035,” wrote Airbus this week. The ZEROe demonstrator will carry four liquid hydrogen tanks in a caudal position, as well as a hydrogen combustion engine mounted along the rear fuselage. The liquid hydrogen distribution system will feed into a conditioning system in which the liquid hydrogen will transform into its gaseous form before it is introduced into the engine where it is combusted for propulsion.
A research team led by the China University of Geosciences designed ultrafine Pd100-xCux alloy nanodot-modified TiO2 photocatalysts via the NaH2PO2-mediated co-deposition route to keep high photocatalytic performance, while replacing platinum (Pt) with palladium as the cocatalyst. “The obtained Pd100-xCux alloy nanodots (2-5 nm) are uniformly dispersed onto TiO2 and their componential ratios can be well controlled by adjusting the molar ratio of Cu and Pd precursor. Based on in situ irradiated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ISI-XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) results, the as-formed Pd100-xCux alloy nanodots can effectively promote the separation of photo-generated charges and weaken the adsorption strength for hydrogen to optimise the process of hydrogen-desorption process on Pd75Cu25 alloy, thus leading to high photocatalytic H2-evolution activity,” the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics wrote on Tuesday.
The US states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to coordinate and develop a regional clean hydrogen hub. The signatory states will work together in developing the Western Inter-State Hydrogen Hub (WISHH) with supporting facilities in each state. “Each state commits that this is the only proposal(s) that they will participate in for a hydrogen hub, and that they will not submit to the DOE [Department of Energy] their own standalone proposal or a proposal in cooperation with other states or entities other than the signatories of this MOU,” reads the document published on Wednesday. Upon agreement of all four Rocky Mountain states, additional western states may be added to the group.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has presented its plans to establish the Takasago Hydrogen Park, calling it the world’s first centre for validation of hydrogen-related technologies, from hydrogen production to power generation. The centre will support the commercialisation of hydrogen gas turbines using hydrogen as fuel. The first part of the plan, which includes demonstrating operations of hydrogen production, storage, and hydrogen fuelling of gas turbines, should commence operations in the fiscal year 2023. “The Takasago Hydrogen Park will be successively expanded and developed going forward. Mitsubishi Power has announced it will use Takasago Hydrogen Park to commercialise small and large frame gas turbines on a path to 100% hydrogen firing starting in 2025,” the Japanese company wrote on Tuesday. 
Vertex Hydrogen, the joint venture between UK-focused downstream energy company Essar Oil UK and UK-based clean energy projects developer Progressive Energy, has unveiled a report detailing the development of the UK’s first-ever large-scale low carbon hydrogen production plant. “The hub will produce 1GW of low carbon hydrogen with the first production line starting in the mid 2020s,” Vertex Hydrogen wrote in a statement. Hydrogen is expected to replace fossil fuels in the industry in North West England and North Wales. The plant will sit at the heart of the HyNet low carbon cluster, the UK’s leading industrial decarbonisation hub. 
Genoa-based classification society RINA has announced the Approval in Principle (AiP) of Swedish designer FKAB Marine Design’s hydrogen-powered MR Tanker, saying it is “the first AiP of a design using currently viable technology and fuels that achieves IMO 2050 targets.” Conceived by the class society and designed by FKAB, the propulsion is based on combining the ship’s fuel (LNG) with steam to produce hydrogen and CO2. “The MR LNG/hydrogen-fuelled vessel is the result of a joint project with ABB and Helbio (a subsidiary of Metacon AB),” wrote Rina last week. The classification society explained that the design allows ships to meet full decarbonisation targets by either running the engine on 100% hydrogen or by producing all the power needed by fuel cells. “In this way, the owner can decide the rate of CO2 reduction.” No additional bunkering, aside from normal LNG, is required. The hydrogen produced can be used to power the main engine, or fuel cells, or a hybrid of the two. Meanwhile, the classification society Korea Register has signed a memorandum of understanding with STX Energy Solutions and Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering to work together to standardise and commercialise solid oxide fuel cells. “The agreement was signed to facilitate the development of a future power generation system through the sharing and application of technology and research resources to meet the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) increasingly rigorous environmental regulations,” Korea Register wrote on Thursday. A Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) produces electricity through the electrochemical reaction of oxygen and hydrocarbons from oxidising LNG. In other words: competing technologies are nearing a similar stage. Most of them, however, will focus on LNG-related shipping solutions. 
Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) encouraged hydrogen usage to accelerate the energy transition in the country. The message was conveyed directly by Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Arifin Tasrif on the sidelines of a bilateral meeting on Monday with the Republic of Korea’s minister of trade, industry and energy, Moon Sung Wook, in Jakarta. “The main strategy to be carried out towards carbon neutrality on the supply side is through the development of massive renewable energy, with a focus on solar, hydro and geothermal power plants as well as hydrogen,” said Arifin.
