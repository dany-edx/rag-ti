NSW Treasurer and Energy Minister Matt Kean announced the government would spark more than $39 billion (USD 26 billion) in private investment and support 13,000 jobs while protecting the state’s energy security.
“NSW can attract international capital, industry and talent if we seize the opportunity to be at the forefront of the low-carbon global economy,” he said.
“We need to reduce our reliance on energy sources that can be taken hostage by authoritarian regimes. By switching to locally made renewable energy, we can not only build a cleaner future, we can also protect our energy security.”
The new target comes just days after the NSW and federal governments announced a $7.8 billion investment to help finance the development of eight critical transmission and renewable energy zone projects as they look to accelerate the state’s clean energy future.
The funding package will help finance the construction of infrastructure needed to connect the state’s planned renewable energy zones (REZs) and the 2 GW Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project to the electricity grid.
The first of these zones, in the Central West and New England regions, are due to be established by 2030, with three others to follow in the southwest, Hunter-Central Coast and Illawarra regions.

One of the first Australian jurisdictions to commit to net zero emissions by 2050, NSW had previously announced its ambition to halve emissions from 2005 levels by 2030.
Kean said the latest projections show the state is on track to achieve its 2035 pledge and in the following five years will make even bigger gains in reductions, prompting the revised ambition.
“We’ve set our clear targets … we’ve got the policies legislated that will meet those targets,” he said.
The Climate Council was among those organisations which praised the NSW government’s new target of a 70% carbon cut by 2035, saying it could help deliver nationwide benefits.
“There is a real sense of momentum towards a clean future in Australia this year,” Climate Council Head of Advocacy Jennifer Rayner said in a statement.
“We’ve seen much stronger targets for renewable energy and emissions reduction announced in Queensland, Victoria and now NSW. It’s great to see states jostling to be at the front of the pack in the race to net zero and Australians will reap the benefits.”
“The further and faster states go on reducing emissions, investing in clean energy technologies like renewables, storage and energy efficiency and phasing out fossil fuels, the more benefits they’ll unlock.”
The new pledge puts NSW near the head of the pack when it comes to emissions reductions, beaten out only by Tasmania which is targeting net zero by 2030.
South Australia and Victoria are both targeting a 50% cut below 2005 levels by 2030, while Queensland is aiming to reach 30% by 2030. All states and territories have agreed to 100% by 2050.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/23/nz-developer-starts-work-on-first-in-suite-of-five-large-scale-solar-farms/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW ZEALAND",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 23, 2022",NZ developer starts work on first in suite of five large-scale solar farms,"New Zealand renewables developer Lodestone Energy said groundworks have commenced at the company’s 39.4 MW Kaitaia Solar Farm being built near the town of the same name in the far north of the nation’s North Island.
Lodestone confirmed the company reached financial close for project last month and that construction contracts have since been issued, all the required solar equipment has been ordered and early works have now commenced at the site.
The company said the first of the expected 60,000 solar panels will be installed in February 2023, and power generation is expected in the third quarter of 2023. The project is expected to generate 55 GWh of renewable energy a year.
Lodestone Energy Managing Director Gary Holden said breaking ground is an enormous milestone for the project which, when completed, will dwarf the country’s largest existing solar farm, the 2.1 MW Kapuni plant in Taranaki, which is operated by Nova Energy.
“For years we’ve had a vision to deliver Aotearoa’s largest solar project, giving New Zealanders an alternative power option and playing a key role in meeting the country’s zero-carbon goals,” he said.

The solar farm is being built on 20 hectares of farmland about three kilometres west of Kaitaia and Holden said the company is committed to maintaining farming practices and preserving and restoring pockets of native bush.
“Beyond the energy we’re generating, we’re also reforesting seven hectares with native trees,” he said. “Then once the solar panels are installed our design allows machinery and livestock to happily exist around the solar arrays, meaning agriculture and grazing can continue.”
The Kaitaia Solar Farm is the first in a suite of large-scale PV projects Lodestone has planned for New Zealand.
The company is developing solar farms in Dargaville, Waiotahe Valley, Edgecumbe and Whitianga, and is also looking for other sites to build on.
“While we’re proud to see works commence in Kaitaia, this is just the beginning,” Holden said. “We have a full construction pipeline already during the next 30 months.”
“These farms are a game changer for the electricity market and will increase New Zealand’s current solar generation eightfold.”
The development of utility scale solar in New Zealand has until now been sluggish compared to neighbouring Australia. About 80% of New Zealand’s electricity is from renewable sources, mostly hydro generation, but less than 1% is generated by solar power.

Data provided by the government-owned Electricity Authority shows that the roll out of solar is starting to accelerate. At the end of last year, New Zealand had 186.7 MW of grid-connected PV power installed, of which 72.4 MW was installed in the preceding 24 months.
Since then, domestic and international developers have announced multiple large-scale projects across the country.
Wellington-based Todd Generation, through subsidiary Nova Energy, is pursuing plans to establish a 400 MW solar farm at Rangitāiki on the North Island and New Zealand’s Contact Energy has teamed with Lightsource bp, the renewables arm of Britain-based BP, to develop a large-scale solar portfolio.
German investment manager Aquila Capital has partnered with Auckland-based renewables developer Far North Solar Farm (FNSF) to develop a suite of large-scale solar PV projects across the North and South islands and Helios Energy, formed by a group of United States and New Zealand entrepreneurs, is also pursuing grid-scale solar developments in the country while the New Zealand arm of UK-based Harmony Energy has announced plans build the 147 MW Tauhei Solar Farm in the Waikato region of the North Island.

Airbus Defence and Space, a division of Netherlands-headquartered aerospace corporation Airbus group, has selected the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney to conduct a multi-year research project that is expected to push the performance of PV cells for space to the limit, both in terms of efficiency and radiation stability.
Airbus said the 3.5-year project will focus on the solar cells that are presently used to power spacecraft. Those cells are composed of several different layers of semiconductor materials that selectively absorb different parts of the solar spectrum. This selectivity enables the cells to operate more efficiently than the standard silicon solar cells used on domestic rooftops.
Professor Ned Ekins-Daukes, from the UNSW Sydney School of Photovoltaic & Renewable Energy Engineering, said the project will explore the merit of introducing patterned, non-planar layers into the cell structure, a technique known as interstitial light-trapping, which can further confine particular wavelengths of light into particular layers of the solar cell.
“Our research on high-efficiency solar cells can help extend the operational life of a spacecraft and lead to light-weight, lower-cost solar arrays,” he said.

Ekins-Daukes, who has previously developed nanostructured, strain-balanced PV absorbers that have utility for solar power conversion in the space environment, said the partnership with Airbus has the potential to open opportunities for commercialisation of this technology in Australia and internationally.
“Partnering with Airbus’ experts will help us to understand the broader aerospace industry requirements for solar power and realise the full potential for these future solar power technologies,” he said.
Airbus Defence and Space UK Managing Director Richard Franklin said the project is a perfect example of industry and academia working together to develop and commercialise technologies to benefit and support the defence and space sectors in Australia.
“This is another example of the world-class research capabilities to be found in Australia, and in partnering with UNSW Sydney, we aim to bring these leading-edge research results to applications in space,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/23/how-closely-monitoring-households-energy-data-can-unleash-solar-outputs-and-possibly-make-them-more-money/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"DECEMBER 23, 2022",How closely monitoring households’ energy data can unleash solar outputs and (possibly) make them more money,"While customers would love to get paid for every bit of energy they’re able to export to the wider grid, operators have imposed a fixed or “static” limit on how much energy each household can export. This helps keep network voltages – or electric pressure – within a safe range.
The limits are needed because of uncertainty about the impacts on the network of fluctuations in households’ energy use and exports.
The network is connected to households via “low voltage” transformers that reduce the voltage to a level customers can use. The uncertainty arises because operators can see what’s happening at each transformer, but not what’s happening in each household.
This could allow households to safely export more solar, depending on local network conditions. People would arguably receive more money while speeding up the transition to zero-emissions electricity by providing more renewable energy to the network.

The electricity network was originally set up for “bulk” generation from centralised power stations. The flow was in one direction from coal, gas or hydroelectric stations to energy users, including households.
However, economic forces and ageing systems mean many of these power stations are being rapidly retired. They’re being replaced, in part, by so-called “distributed energy resources”. These resources include rooftop solar, household or community batteries, and electric vehicles.
The household export limit to the network is usually around 5 kilowatts (kW), regardless of time of day or what households are generating or consuming. But, because of the falling cost of solar, 10kW residential systems (capable of producing twice the export limit) are increasingly common.
The Australian grid operator, AEMO, envisages distributed solar generation will make up 69GW of network capacity by 2050, compared to around 21GW now.
Integrating this energy generation is a big challenge for the energy market, transmission and distribution network operators.
The Australian Standard for household voltage has “allowable” and “preferred” operating zones around 230 volts. Keeping the voltage within these zones is better for energy efficiency and appliance life.
But when energy flow is “two-way” and unpredictable, both to and from houses, it becomes more challenging to keep the voltage within these zones. When lights flicker or appliances are damaged, that’s a sign the voltage is outside these safe limits.

If the operators could see household voltage and current data in real time, they might be able to set “dynamic” limits on households for the import and export of energy. That means limits are allowed to fluctuate depending on local network conditions, instead of being static. Households might then be able export more energy overall than they do now.
A long-term project of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, Project SHIELD, aims to answer a key question here. That is, how much data do operators need to allow this flexibility, while still safely co-ordinating energy flows to and from the grid?
The project involves The University of Queensland, network operators and the private sector. A project partner, Luceo Energy (an offshoot of a company that formerly employed one of the authors), working with Energex, Ergon and Essential Energy, has rolled out 20,000 devices in households across Queensland that collect their energy data at one-minute intervals.
Smart meters installed in Victoria typically record energy data every 30 minutes. The new devices measure multiple electricity parameters, such as voltage and current, every minute.
This creates extraordinary amounts of data, which can be used in electricity studies and simulations. It also creates storage and analysis challenges.
The data collected are used to answer “what if?” questions. If an operator had perfect knowledge of conditions at every house attached to a transformer, they could create a safe dynamic limit. But would it still be safe if they could see the data for only 50%, or even 20%, of houses?
World-first simulation systems developed by Queensland company GridQube enable the operators to answer such questions. Data collected by the devices provide a key input.
Several representative locations and time periods have been chosen to see how network visibility can affect the envelope. The local network is simulated using a “power flow” with different network parameters, such as voltage. Then the key questions around safe limits can be answered.

Of course, this is only one level of the electricity network. We still need to build considerable amounts of high-voltage transmission to integrate increasing distributed energy resources. This will help provide a reliable and secure power supply.
The data generated by Project SHIELD will inform electricity modellers and data scientists about what is happening at the household level (both electricity usage and solar generation). It can improve forecasting and modelling as data on this scale have not been previously available.
As the roll-out of devices and gathering of data continue at speed, operators can start to relax the limits on household solar energy exports. Greater visibility of local networks offers clear benefits for both consumers and operators.

The draft declaration details the intended capacity, geographical area and required network infrastructure that will make up the Illawarra REZ – centred around the steel city of Wollongong, south of Sydney.
The Energy Corporation of NSW (EnergyCo), a government-controlled authority appointed to lead the delivery of the renewable energy zones, said the declaration is the first step in formalising the REZ under the Electricity Infrastructure Investment Act 2020.
EnergyCo said the capacity of the Illawarra REZ will be no less than 1 GW but said this “may increase over time with the growth of offshore wind and other emerging technologies.”
An initial expressions of interest process for the Illawarra REZ received commercial interest to develop 44 projects, including wind, solar, energy storage, pumped hydro and green hydrogen production totalling 17 GW of capacity and representing more than $43 billion (USD 28.7 billion) of potential investment.
The proposals include five large-scale solar projects, and. 16 energy storage projects including 11 batteries and four pumped-hydro projects. Investors have also proposed eight offshore and two onshore wind energy projects, and three new “load projects” including green steel manufacturing.

Energy Minister Matt Kean said the Illawarra region is an ideal location for the development of a renewable energy zone and will play a critical role in providing reliable and clean electricity to homes and businesses in NSW as coal-fired power stations progressively close over the next 10 to 15 years.
“The Illawarra is well placed to become a renewable energy powerhouse, thanks to its existing energy, port and transport infrastructure, its highly skilled workforce and strong demand from existing industries to decarbonise,” he said.
The Illawarra REZ is one of five renewable energy zones included in the NSW government’s electricity Roadmap. REZs are also being developed in the South-West, Hunter-Central Coast, New England and Central-West Orana regions and are expected to bring at least 12 GW of renewable energy and 2 GW of storage online.
That capacity is likely to be revised with the registration of interest process for all five of the renewable energy zones having been swamped by investors. While the Illawarra REZ attracted interest to develop 17 GW of capacity, the Central West Orana REZ drew 27 GW of interest when it had planned to coordinate 3 GW. The New England REZ attracted 34 GW for a proposed 8 GW of integrated assets, the Hunter-Central Coast REZ received more than 80 clean energy projects totalling almost 40 GW while the South-West REZ attracted 34 GW of potential generation and storage projects.
The draft declaration for the Illawarra REZ will remain on public exhibition until mid-February 2023.

The team surveyed 80 professionals from 10 professional groups involved in BIPV, including architects, engineers, researchers, PV installers, and property developers, across the globe.
The survey identified methods, approaches, and workflows in BIPV design and analysis under four key areas: solar irradiation, BIPV power output, building performance, and financial and design outcome.
It found that “there’s a lack of awareness among the respondents on the methods and models used to estimate [plane of array], power output, embodied emissions, heat island impact, thermal, daylighting, structural and fire requirements of BIPV projects,” the authors wrote.
With respect to shading, the survey revealed that more than 25% of respondents are unsure of what’s the most suitable method for estimating shading in BIPV projects. The ray-tracking approach was chosen by the largest cohort of professionals, followed by the shading percentage method, and then the far-field shading horizon map tool.
“To do that work right, we need better building design tools,” Rebecca Yang, associate professor at RMIT University in Melbourne and co-author of the report, told pv magazine.
Existing building design tools currently use suboptimal shading estimation methods, Yang said.
First, these tools often lack many PV products in their database, resulting in calculations using inaccurate parameters. Second, the shading estimates are usually done for large surfaces of the building and over a short time interval, rather than at the individual panel level over a long time period. The reason, according to Yang, is that the latter calculations would be very time-consuming and take a large amount of computing power.
BIPV professionals may also lack the technical knowledge to work with the existing tools, according to Yang. Information on how to use these tools is also often not readily available.
“A lot of firms don’t use complex building design software, which makes the simulation very conceptual and high level, and cannot provide very detailed simulations,” she said.
The IEA-PVPS report concluded that research and development into the most suitable methods for BIPV shading estimation, among many others, is required to improve its uptake.
“Due to the cross-functional nature of BIPV as a building material and an electro-technical device, there’s a need to improve the knowledge and awareness of both the [architecture, engineering, and construction] industry and BIPV industry professionals on the BIPV design and analysis methods and workflow,” the authors said.

The results have been confirmed by the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin (ISFH).
“Addressing the long-term pain point of HJT cells, Longi’s R&D team focused on market demand and technological innovation to achieve the new conversion efficiency for its commercial gallium-doped silicon wafer, 0.44% higher than the 26.12% announced in September this year,” the company said in a statement.
The Chinese PV module maker announced a power conversion efficiency of 26.12% for the same solar cell in September, and an efficiency rating of 25.47% in March.
For the indium-free HJT cells, the team replaced traditional indium-based transparent conductive film with alternative materials. It claims the different materials are cheaper and more environmentally friendly.
“The development also offers a potential solution to the industry’s dependence on indium for large-scale mass production, signaling a way forward for HJT to move towards terawatt scale production levels,” said Longi.
In November, Longi claimed a record-breaking 26.81% efficiency rating for an unspecified HJT solar cell. In addition, the Chinese manufacturer recorded an efficiency of 26.5% for a n-type heterojunction solar cell in June and a 25.19% rating for a p-type TOPCon solar cell in July 2021. In June 2021, it reported a 25.21% efficiency rating for an n-type TOPCon PV cell.

From pv magazine Germany
Scientists from Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) have once more broken the efficiency world record of tandem solar cells consisting of a silicon bottom cell and a perovskite top cell. The 32.5% efficiency record has been officially confirmed by the certifying institute European Solar Test Installation.
“This is a really big leap forward that we didn’t foresee a few months ago,” said Steve Albrecht from HZB’s perovskite tandem solar cell department. “All the teams involved at HZB, especially the teams from the PV Competence Center (PVcomB) and the HySPRINT Innovation Lab, have worked together excellently and with great dedication on this.
His team used an improved perovskite compound with a modificed surface. Silvia Mariotti and Eike Köhnen, both authors of the study, developed an interface modification in which charge recombination losses are largely suppressed. Furthermore, they applied special measurement methods to better understand the fundamental processes. These developments were then successfully transferred to tandem solar cells and combined with further optical improvements by Lea Zimmermann.
In recent years, there has been a continuous increase in efficiency values by various research institutions and photovoltaic companies worldwide. At the end of 2021, various teams from HZB achieved a then record value of 29.8% efficiency. To achieve this, they introduced special, periodic nanotextures into the solar cells. Then, this summer, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, was able to significantly surpass that value again, achieving 31.3% efficiency with a certified tandem cell.
Now the highest value of 32.5% efficiency was again achieved by the HZB. “We are very pleased about the renewed significant leap in efficiency. This demonstrates the high potential of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells to contribute to a sustainable energy supply and turnaround in the coming years,” said Albrecht.
HZB’s chief scientific officer, Bernd Rech, noted that “at 32.5%, the solar cell efficiency of the HZB tandems is now in ranges previously only achieved by expensive III/V semiconductors.”
Just last week, Meyer Burger signed a multi-year cooperation agreement together with several research institutes in Germany and Switzerland, including HZB. This involves the industrialization of perovskite tandem solar cells and modules.
