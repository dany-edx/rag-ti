The project, being developed near the town of Kununurra, is expected to commence operations in 2028, targeting 50,000 tonnes of green hydrogen and 250,000 tonnes of green ammonia per annum for domestic and export markets.
The East Kimberley Clean Energy Project will be planned, created and managed by the Aboriginal Clean Energy (ACE) partnership, a new company in which equal shares are held by the traditional owners of the land where the project is to be built.
The MG Corporation, representing the Miriuwung and Gajerron people, and the Balanggarra Aboriginal Corporation will each own a 25% stake in the ACE, as will the Kimberley Land Council and Pollination.
Pollination Head of Projects Rob Grant said the “first-of-its-kind partnership” provides a model for infrastructure projects in Australia that will ensure traditional owners benefit from the scale and pace of the transition to renewable energy.
“This project represents a just, ambitious and achievable vision for Australia’s clean energy future,” he said. “It leverages natural advantages and existing energy and port infrastructure already in place in the East Kimberley region to create a major new clean energy export hub that will help Australia and our region decarbonise, grow new industries and ensure transitional owners and local residents are shareholders, not just stakeholders, in the benefits.”
Grant said the involvement of the traditional owner groups directly in the project also offers attractive prospects to investors by mitigating risks associated with land use agreements and approvals.

The first stage of the project will involve building a 900 MW solar farm – more than double the size of the country’s biggest so far built – and a 50,000 tonnes per year green hydrogen plant on MG Corporation freehold land near Kununurra.
The resulting solar energy will be combined with fresh water from Lake Kununurra and hydro energy from the existing Ord Hydro Power Plant at Lake Argyle to produce green hydrogen that will then be transported through a new 120-kilometre pipeline to the “export ready” Port of Wyndham. There it will be converted into green ammonia.
About 250,000 tonnes of green ammonia is expected to be produced annually for both domestic and export markets in the fertilisers and explosives sectors.
While the project’s feasibility and funding are still pending, construction is expected to begin in late 2025, with hydrogen production starting by late 2028.
Grant said scoping studies have already been completed to define the project concept, and feasibility studies will now commence, including 12 months of environmental, engineering and approvals work.
The announcement of the project comes just 24 hours after the traditional owners of Yindjibarndi lands announced they would team with Philippines-based energy giant ACEN Corporation to develop more than 3 GW of wind, solar and battery storage in WA’s Pilbara region.

The factory, to be built in the Philippines’ free-trade zone at New Clark City about 130 kilometres north of eth national capital Manila, is expected to commence commercial operations early next year.
St Baker said the plant, dubbed the StB Giga Factory, would produce lithium-ion phosphate batteries for residential and commercial-scale energy storage applications. He also noted the batteries will be suitable for use in electric vehicles (EV) and EV charging stations.
“StB Giga Factory is positioned to capture the once-in-century transition towards a renewable energy electricity system, in which lithium-ion batteries are expected to play a pivotal role,” he said.
“Our battery products will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve fuel independence, improve electricity reliability, decrease the grid reliance for EV charging at peak system demand times, and with major electricity cost savings for households and businesses, and transport users generally.”
The plant, which will target domestic demand in the Philippines and export to Australia, the United States, India and countries in the Asia-Pacific region, is forecast to have an initial output of 150 MWh per year, rising to full first-stage production capacity of 1.2 GWh by 2030.
St Baker said he does expect the production capacity will continue to scale up as the global demand for battery energy storage systems grows.
The factory will be built in property develop Filinvest Innovation’s 120-hectare industrial park at New Clark City with St Baker Energy Innovation Fund having already signed a five-year lease for a 5,000 square metre factory unit.
The Filinvest facility is registered with the Philippine Economic Zone Authority which provides tenants with tax breaks and simplified import-export procedures.

The Maverick system is a ground-mounted solar array of up to 90 pre-wired PV panels which are fitted to frames that can be unfolded accordion style. The frames come preassembled on concrete blocks that replace conventional mounting structures, allowing for rapid installation on site.
5B claimed a new record for solar deployment last year when two crews of 10 people deployed 1.1 MW in a single day at AES’ Andes solar farm in Chile’s Atacama Desert.
WFA said 5B’s Maverick solution is revolutionising the solar industry by “streamlining the installation process, reducing costs, and enhancing safety.”
“By making solar deployment faster, more cost-effective, and safer, 5B aims to accelerate access to low-cost, gigawatt-scale solar energy,” it said in a statement.

WFA said 5B is continuing to shape the future of the solar industry by integrating robotics and automation in both field deployment and factory-based assembly, alluding to the company’s commencement of construction of an Advanced Manufacturing Pilot Line (AMPL) which has been designed to fast-track the delivery of its Maverick solar arrays.
5B said once fully operational, the mostly automated manufacturing, assembly, and deployment process line is expected to produce a 50-70 kW solar array every 30 minutes with minimal labour.
5B co-founder Chris McGrath said the WFA award is recognition of the role the company’s technology is playing in the energy transformation.
“Speed is key to decarbonising economies and managing the increasing scarcity of resources – that’s our strength,” he said.
To date, 5B has deployed its technology across more than 140 sites worldwide, with a total generating capacity exceeding 70 MW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/18/sodium-ion-battery-fleet-to-grow-to-10-gwh-by-2025/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"JULY 18, 2023",Sodium-ion battery fleet to grow to 10 GWh by 2025,"While still in its infancy, sodium-ion technology represents a viable alternative to lithium-ion battery technologies. With better raw material costs, enhanced safety, and better sustainability credentials, sodium-ion holds a promise of easing the strain on lithium-ion’s supply chains.
As global commercialisation efforts for sodium-ion batteries intensify, IDTechEx forecasts that by 2025, around 10 GWh of sodium-ion batteries will be installed as significant manufacturing capacities come online and existing lithium-ion lines are converted to sodium-ion production.
At a CAGR of 27%, sodium-ion is forecast to grow to just under 70 GWh in 2033, says the UK-based market research company. “There may be potential for more rapid growth than forecast once the technology is trusted, qualified, bankable, and available,” it added.
Earlier forecast from Wood Mackenzie is more conservative. According to the US-owned Scottish data company, sodium-ion batteries are expected to replace some of the lithium iron phosphate (LFP) share in passenger electric vehicles and energy storage, reaching 20 GWh by 2030 in the base-case scenario.
Presently, production is mainly limited to pilot plants, and a few smaller factories are starting up. However, IDTechEx calculates that “the capacities that have been publicly announced by various raw material manufacturers alone add up to well over 100 GWh over the next three years.”
IDTechEx said in its latest report that it has identified around 15 companies developing their own Na-ion battery technologies. It has also analyzed patents and found that China is taking the lead once again.
For instance, battery industry heavyweight CATL rolled out its first-generation sodium-ion battery in 2021, with an energy density of 160 Wh/kg and promised an increase to 200 Wh/kg. Earlier this year, it confirmed that China’s Chery will become the first automaker to use its sodium-ion battery tech.
HiNa Battery, which was spun off from the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2017, became the world’s first company to switch on a gigawatt-hour sodium-ion battery production line last year. It also revealed plans to expand the capacity to 5 GWh.
Last week, BYD’s subsidiary FinDreams said it had found a partner in Huaihai Holding Group to begin producing sodium-ion batteriesin the Xuzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone in the Jiangsu province. In a press release, the companies said the joint venture will be the world’s largest supplier of sodium-ion batteries for mini and micro vehicles.
Until now, sodium-ion batteries have mainly been used in electric two-wheelers and for stationary energy storage due to their lower energy density compared to lithium-ion batteries. Sodium-ion is three times heavier than its lithium counterpart and has a lower redox potential, which results in at least 30% lower energy density.
Sodium-ion batteries are quoted to be between 20% and up to 40% cheaper, but the challenge is bringing the technology to scale. Therefore, significant saving over lithium-ion batteries is unlikely, at least initially.
According to IDTechEx research, the average cell cost for Na-ion batteries is $87/kWh taking different chemistries into account. By the end of the decade, the production cost of Na-ion battery cells using primarily iron and manganese is likely to bottom out at around $40/kWh, which would be around $50/kWh at the pack level, the company calculates.
