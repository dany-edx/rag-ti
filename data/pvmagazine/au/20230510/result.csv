Using Tesla’s Megapack technology and grid forming advanced inverters, the total capacity of the project is 150 MW / 300 MWh.
Built in the state’s Riverina region, in the southwest, the project is made up of three separate battery facilities:
As outlined, 100% of the project’s output has been contracted to Shell Energy and EnergyAustralia for the next 10 years.
The project received funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and NSW government, which jointly provided $13.1 million to support the project’s use of advanced inverters which can increase hosting capacity in the region.
Exactly which inverter brand the project uses is not mentioned, but Edify Energy’s Chief Executive, John Cole, said the inverters operate in virtual synchronous generator mode, meaning they provide vital system strength services previously only afforded by fossil generators.
The project is 90% owned by Federation Asset Management, a fund manager specialising in private equity assets in the energy transition. The remaining 10% is owned by Edify Energy, which has developed and will operate the project.
Federation Asset Management said the Riverina and Darlington Point energy storage systems will be a seed asset for its  Sustainable Australian Real Asset fund (SARA), a pure play Australian energy transition fund currently open to institutional investors.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/10/clean-energy-takes-centre-stage-in-federal-budget-industry-reactions/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 10, 2023","Clean energy takes centre stage in federal budget, industry reactions","Described as a foundation, “building blocks” for Australia’s renewable pathway, the Albanese Labor government’s federal budget has been met warmly by advocates for renewables, for the most part. There are, of course, calls for the federal government to go further in its support, but the primary criticism revolves around the failure to demand more from polluters and cease fossil fuel subsidies.
Nonetheless, the change in rhetoric from the last federal budget, delivered by Scott Morrison’s previous Coalition government, is seismic. In total, the budget allocates an additional $4 billion towards Australia’s superpower vision, expanding on what was allocated in October’s budget and from previously announced programs. Half of this, $2 billion, is going specifically towards hydrogen.
Pv magazine Australia looks at what’s new in terms of funding, what’s been omitted and industry reactions.
As unsexy as it sounds, building the government’s internal capacity to do things like ensure emissions are correctly measured, green hydrogen is in fact green, carbon credits represent actual abatement and new buildings won’t leach energy are undeniably important for the energy transition.
The 2023 budget delivers funding for all these things – something Climate Energy Finance lead finance and energy analyst, Tim Buckley, describes as “sensible.”
To that end, the budget has allocated $46.5 million to the Australian Energy Regulator to regulate energy markets. The Regulator will also oversee Australia’s hydrogen ‘Guarantee of Origin’ scheme, which seeks to quantify the carbon intensity of hydrogen products, and has been awarded $38.2 million. This scheme, while generally welcomed, has been critiqued for not seeking to guarantee ‘time-matched’ renewable energy is being used for green hydrogen projects – something being demanded by the US and Europe. 
There is also $5.6 million for the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water to conduct analysis to ensure Australia keeps its competitive edge, skilled workforce and secure supply chains for renewable energy ventures.
On the topic of workforce, the clean energy skills and training sector will benefit from an additional $3.7 billion for the National Skills Agreement over the next five years, taking the total spend to $12.8 billion.
The government has also allocated $4.2 million for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, better known as ASIC, to enforce actions against greenwashing.
A further $18 million will go towards reforming the Australian Carbon Credit Unit (ACCU) scheme, which has been plagued by scandals over the last years.
Budget support for the renewables sector came in many different flavours – though is seemingly less direct than the support being offered to hydrogen and households.
Around $90 million will go towards progressing Australia’s new Capacity Investment Scheme which basically sets out to underwrite storage projects across Australia and firm renewable generation via an auction process. The scheme is aiming to “unlock” $10 billion in new investment.
To support Australian businesses manufacturing, commercialising and adopting renewable technologies, $14.8 million has been allocated as part of the Powering Australia Industry Growth Centre.
Critical minerals used to make renewable technologies also featured in the budget, with the government investing $57.1 million to develop Critical Minerals International Partnerships – building on $2 billion for the Critical Minerals Facility and another $1 billion targeted to value‑adding in resources, under the National Reconstruction Fund. The previously announced National Reconstruction Fund has up to $3 billion allocated for investment in low emissions technologies including green metals.
The federal government has leveraged $12 billion of its $20 billion investment in Rewiring the Nation to what it describes as “transformational transmission projects,” including:

Hydrogen has to be one of the budget’s biggest winners, attracting $2 billion for production incentives. The move seems to be in response to the growing upset around Australia’s hydrogen potential being undercut by the US Inflation Reduction Act, which heavily subsidises hydrogen.
Of the hydrogen funding, John Grimes, Chief Executive of the Smart Energy Council said: “Reverse auction tendering with a gigawatt scale hydrogen capacity to be delivered by the end of this decade – with funding for First Nations people to engage with Australia’s renewable hydrogen industry – that is a great shift forward.” The First Nations engagement part of the policy has been awarded $2 million.
The Clean Energy Council said the hydrogen funding would help leverage billions in private investment, describing it is a “substantial downpayment on Australia’s response to the United States Inflation Reduction Act.”
A number of hydrogen companies in Australia have also voiced support. “These will help bridge the commercial gap for early projects and put Australia on course for up to a gigawatt of electrolyser capacity by 2030 through two to three flagship projects,” WA-based hydrogen company Provaris said. The company also applauded the $38 million in funding for the Guarantee of Origin or GOO scheme, noting “credible certification has been a consistent discussion point” in its negotiations.
On top of $3 billion in rebates to directly reduce energy bills for over 5 million households, the budget has set up a Household Energy Upgrades Fund.

The total $1.3 billion fund will provide $1 billion to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) to finance home energy upgrades, like installing solar or energy efficiency appliances, for around 110,000 households.
The government has also delivered on a previous promise to co-fund a $600 million to upgrade social housing, for which it has allocated $300 million.
There is also $36.7 million to expand and upgrade the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme  (NatHERS) to apply to existing homes, which will give households better information for decisions on energy upgrades and renting or buying homes.
Like households, small businesses are also being encouraged to upgrade their energy systems. The government’s Small Business Energy Incentive will provide $310 million in tax relief to support small businesses to make investments like electrifying heating and cooling.
This particular policy was met cooly by the managing director of solar company Smart Commercial Solar, Huon Hoogesteger. “Forgive my scepticism of vote-grabbing headlines, but 95% of small businesses are not the ones that have the spare cash to be spending on non-core business items,” Hoogesteger said. “This cash won’t stimulate new markets and it’s a relatively small amount of money when you consider there are 2.4 million small businesses in Australia…that equates to less than $130 each.”
Perhaps the most defining two words of the energy transition, ‘not enough,’ have also been lobbed at the 2023 budget – which, having delivered Australia’s first surplus in years, clearly had more money to spend.
All this talk of a budget surplus, what is a surplus good for? Are we saving for a rainy day? People are starving. People are homeless. The environment’s collapsing before our eyes. The rainy day is now. It’s fucking pouring. The government should be spending every dollar it can.

“$4 billion in new funding to make Australia a renewable energy superpower, taking total funding to $40 billion including the previously announced programs,” Climate Energy Finance (CEF) lead finance and energy analyst, Tim Buckley, said. “But this is well below the cumulative $100 billion of public capital Climate Energy Finance considers is required to crowd-in $200-300 billion of private capital investment to position Australia as a global leader in energy transition and ensure our energy security and independence.”
Aside from fiscal conservatism, the Albanese government has also been criticised for its refusal to stop subsidising fossil fuel industries, and for failing to demand more money from polluters.
“Labor’s still spending $41.4 billion on fossil fuel subsidies, more than the $29.5 billion climate spend,” Greens leader Adam Bandt said. 
Australia can look to Norway to see how to tax oil and gas properly.
Norway taxes oil and gas at 78%, still has a highly profitable industry, and has the world's biggest sovereign wealth fund because of it.

Alongside the continuing subsidies for oil and gas, Buckley described the government’s failure to move on demanding proper corporate tax as “disappointing.” 
“We call on the government to refocus attention on multinational corporates operating in Australia to ensure they pay at least some corporate tax here, particularly those fossil fuel global giants who have paid nothing over the last decade, even as they use our finite public resources for private foreign gain. It is disappointing to see not even a reference to this in the 2023 budget,” Buckley said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/10/australian-scientists-warn-of-heat-induced-failure-risks-in-hjt-glass-backsheet-pv-modules/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 10, 2023",Australian scientists warn of heat-induced failure risks in HJT glass-backsheet PV modules,"From pv magazine Global
A research team from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) has investigated failure modes in heterojunction (HJT) solar modules with glass-backsheet configurations.
“We have identified four failure modes in the silicon heterojunction glass-backsheet module which has the potential to result in a power loss of up to 50% following damp heat testing,” researcher Chandany Sen told pv magazine. “We sought to understand the possible underlying causes of each failure mode and how to quickly detect them at the cell level.”
The scientists conducted their experiment on bifacial half-cut n-type silicon HJT solar cells sourced from industrial production lines of unidentified manufacturers. The products were divided into three groups: modules with encapsulated cells; modules with encapsulated cell precursors; and non-encapsulated cells. For the first two groups, the researchers used ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulant.
“All samples featured an n-type wafer, intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon (i-a-Si:H) passivation layers on both sides, and phosphorus-doped (n-a-Si:H) and boron-doped (p-a-Si:H) hydrogenated amorphous silicon layers on the front and rear sides, respectively, followed by indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) layer deposited on both sides,” they said.
All devices underwent a damp heat test at 85°C and 85% relative humidity (RH) for durations between 500 hours and 4000 hours.
Through this testing, the academics identified four failure modes for the encapsulated cells, resulting in power losses ranging from 5% to 50%. The first failure type consisted of cell darkening in localised points, and the second was represented by darkening around the interconnection of busbars and ribbon wires. The third failure mode involved intense darkening between the interconnected regions of busbars and ribbon wires, while the fourth showed darkening on the interconnected region of busbars and ribbon wires.
According to the group’s analysis, the first failure type was attributable to surface contamination, which may have occurred during handling or characterisation before module encapsulation. As for the second and third groups, the scientists attributed the failures to the involvement of soldering flux.
“The direct impact of flux and lead (Pb) solder in causing contact degradation after DH testing was also observed in other work,” they said. “It is essential to highlight that, in some cases, the usage of a different Ag paste also resulted in a Type-3 failure.”
For the fourth group, the researchers indicated that the failures likely originated from the byproduct of EVA used for encapsulation.
“Although the experimental design in this work cannot determine exactly how each failure mode occurred after DH testing, it demonstrates plausible situations that could happen in the industry environment and lead to the actual failure modes observed,” they concluded.
Sen said that comprehending and mitigating these failure modes, preferably at the solar cell level, will be crucial to realizing the low-levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) potential of HJT. She said that while glass-glass modules are frequently employed for HJT solar cells due to their reduced susceptibility to moisture ingress, similar failure modes are likely to occur in these modules over more extended periods.
The research team presented its findings in the study “Four failure modes in silicon heterojunction glass-backsheet modules,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.

A research team from the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland found that hydrogen was a significant energy vector in all future energy systems based on renewables. “Electrofuel storages were needed in all systems and their capacity was the highest in the northern Hemiboreal system. Absence of cavern storage potential did not hamper the significance of electrofuels but increased the role of ammonia and led to average 5.5 % systemic cost increase,” the researchers said in their paper “Impact of climate and geological storage potential on feasibility of hydrogen fuels,” published in Applied Energy. The term hemiboreal refers to areas halfway between the temperate and subarctic zones. In their optimisation-based framework for centralized planning of energy systems relying on renewable power generation, the Finnish team found that “with the adopted cost assumptions electrolysis was a cost-efficient technology in all of the studied climates.” In almost all systems, hydrogen use for direct power generation was insignificant but important for sectors that are hard or expensive to electrify directly, the researchers found. The results also showed that in some regions where cavern storages are unavailable, liquid hydrogen could assume the role of energy storage.
Fusion Fuel entered into a €2.46 million ($3.83 million) equipment supply contract with Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC) for a 550 kW solar-to-green hydrogen project in Zaragoza, Spain. The project comprises the development of on-premises green hydrogen production and dispensing system for mobility in Zaragoza, along with supplementary solar photovoltaic generation and an energy storage system. The project will be developed in cooperation with Zoilo Ríos service stations. Fusion Fuel will supply 22 of its HEVO-Solar units, along with the balance of plant equipment for water purification and hydrogen compression and storage to 500 bar. The company expects to deliver the equipment to the project in the third quarter of 2023. “Our business development team is focused on our core markets in Portugal and Spain as well as some of the priority markets that we have previously identified, like North America and Italy,” Fusion Fuel told pv magazine. The PEM electrolyser technology company explained that they perceive a disconnect in terms of project execution and technology deployment. “We are making a concerted effort to focus more on actionable projects and to communicate them to market once they have reached a sufficient level of development.”
AW-Energy and Kaoko Green Energy Solutions have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for hydrogen production in Namibia. “The MoU is devoted to the development of renewable energy and aims to produce green hydrogen from renewable energy sources including wave energy,” said the near-shore wave energy technology company. Namibia enjoys an “energetic and consistent wave resource,” added AW-Energy CEO Christopher Ridgewell.
CWP Global and Hydrogenious LOHC Technologies have signed an MoU for a joint feasibility study in 2023 that will explore a 500-tons-per-day hydrogen transport chain from Morocco to Europe using Hydrogenious’ liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) technology. “The 15 GW AMUN project near the city of Tan Tan in Morocco will be explored as a starting point in the feasibility study. This project is focused on producing ammonia locally from green hydrogen to support the decarbonisation of fertiliser and maritime shipping,” said the German LOHC technology company. 
Nikola Corporation and Voltera signed a definitive agreement to develop up to 50 hydrogen refueling stations throughout North America over the next five years. “This partnership underpins Nikola’s prior announced plans to develop 60 stations by 2026,” wrote the transportation company. Voltera will site, build, own, and operate the stations, while Nikola will supply the hydrogen fuel and provide technical expertise.
EWE and Salzgitter signed a declaration of intent to cooperate in the hydrogen sector. “As part of the planned cooperation, EWE and Salzgitter have agreed that EWE will produce and supply green hydrogen, which Salzgitter will use for virtually CO2-free steel production,” said the Oldenburg-based energy service provider.
