The three-year project will identify how best to manage the continuing influx of rooftop solar and other DERs, how the assets respond to contingency events such as the loss of a large generator or transmission line and how they can be utilised to protect the NEM from such events in the future.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), which along with solar monitoring company Solar Analytics is partnering with the UNSW on the project, identified in its Renewable Integration Study that the high penetration of rooftop solar presents critical challenges to Australia’s power system security.
Renewable energy generation has almost doubled in Australia in the past five years and now accounts for more than one quarter of the nation’s electricity supply.
Data provided by the Clean Energy Council (CEC) shows that Australia’s renewable energy generation rocketed from 14.6% in 2015 to 27.7% in 2020 with much of the increase due to rooftop solar with more than 3 GW of new small-scale capacity added in 2020.
Australia is now leading the world in rooftop solar PV installations, with more than 2.5 million systems across the country but research project lead Naomi Stringer, from the UNSW’s School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, said there is work to be done to effectively integrate them across the power system.
“How these systems behave when sitting on our rooftops can have material impacts on the broader electricity grid,” she said.
“Unexpected events such as lightning strikes and equipment failures take place every day in the power grid. Very occasionally major disturbances occur, and the ability of the overall power system to ride through and then recover is key.
“Impacts of rooftop solar can be particularly acute during disturbance events when the grid is already strained, posing new risks to power system security.”

Stringer said there is very little data showing how solar PV behaves during contingency events but said there are opportunities to harness rooftop solar capabilities to help restore power system security.
The aim of the research project is to improve data capture, assess inverter behaviour, inform the development of new standards and set up tools and frameworks for long-term monitoring of solar and DER asset behaviour.
The project findings will be used by AEMO to improve planning and operation of the grid power system. It aims to ensure that conservative measures that might adversely impact PV system owners and the public more generally are avoided.
AEMO chief member services officer Violette Mouchaileh said project partners will collaborate with stakeholders across the industry including inverter and battery manufacturers to investigate novel data streams.
“The findings of this project will help us build the smarter grid we need to operate securely, safely and reliably with much higher levels of distributed generation,” she said.
“It’s making sure we’ve got the tools in place and can support the decisions that consumers are making to invest in these kinds of resources.”
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) announced on Thursday it would provide $981,000 in funding for the project under its Advancing Renewables Program.
“UNSW’s project is an exciting step in developing the vital components for rooftop solar and DER and the benefits they bring to supporting the electricity grid,” ARENA CEO Darren Miller said.
“Integrating renewables into the electricity system is a key priority for ARENA, so the tools being developed throughout the project will help to ensure that Australia’s record-breaking solar installations continue to be of benefit to the grid and in helping with system security.”

CEP said the 200,000 square metre rooftop solar farm would be the largest in Australia.
The renewable energy fund has signed a 45-year lease agreement with the Pelligra Group, the current owners of the iconic former GMH factory site – now known as the Lionsgate Business Park – and intends to begin construction on the $200 million solar+battery project in early 2022.
CEP.Energy CEO Peter Wright said the 122-hectare Lionsgate Business Park was an ideal site for a big battery which would replace the existing temporary diesel generation on site, with clean, cost-effective electricity for Australian businesses.
“The Lionsgate site is zoned industrial and has the all-important existing grid connection capacity,” he said.
“Large-scale storage within the South Australian distribution network will assist with the management of local network voltages and solar supply peaks and troughs.
“Pelligra’s vision for the Lionsgate Business Park fits perfectly with the CEP’S business strategy to stimulate new jobs and economic activity in major manufacturing and commercial hubs by reducing operating costs.”
The Lionsgate solar+battery project announcement comes just weeks after CEP unveiled plans to build the world’s largest grid-scale battery in New South Wales, a 1.2 GW megabattery at Kurri Kurri in the Hunter Valley region.

The Lionsgate and Kurri Kurri batteries form part of a 2 GW battery storage portfolio CEP – which finances, builds, owns and operates renewable energy microgrids and virtual power plants (VPPs) in partnership with property portfolio groups – has planned for Australia.
“CEP’s grid-scale battery network is part of our dual-track strategy to generate and store clean, reliable and cost-effective electricity for Australian businesses,” Wright said, “and make excess power available to the national grid to firm up the increase in renewable generation.”
Wright has previously said CEP is aiming to have 1.5 GW of solar and 400 MW of battery energy storage within five years providing a steady flow of low-cost energy for commercial, retail and industrial tenants across the country.
South Australian Minister for Energy and Mining Dan van Holst Pellekaan said the Lionsgate Energy Storage System was a “fantastic initiative” and would transform the former Holden manufacturing site.
“The combination of a large solar array, grid-scale battery and virtual power plant on a large industrial site fits perfectly with our government’s energy policy,” he said.
“This style of project will deliver value for the tenants as well as all other South Australian electricity consumers by reducing peak demand on the grid.”
Pelligra Group chairman Ross Pelligra said the partnership with CEP was a key component in a plan to attract companies to the former car manufacturing site.
“Our plan is to develop a centre for the next generation of industrial businesses driven by rapid developments in skills and technology,’’ he said.
“The agreement with CEP for the on-site battery will deliver Lionsgate tenants cost-effective energy generated on the roof-tops above.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/01/sun-cable-lodges-plan-for-major-solar-module-manufacturing-plant/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 1, 2021",Sun Cable lodges plan for major solar module manufacturing plant,"The Singaporean consortium behind the $26 billion Australia-ASEAN Power Link (AAPL) announced this week it had lodged an application with the Northern Territory’s Development Consent Authority for a facility that will manufacture Maverick solar array systems designed by Australian company 5B.
The prefabricated, pre-wired Maverick system, designed by Sydney-based manufacturer 5B, has been tapped as the module of choice for the AAPL project – a 14 GW solar farm and approximately 33 GWh battery energy storage system to be constructed near Elliott, in the Barkly Region of the Northern Territory.
Sun Cable said the first stage of the proposed manufacturing facility will pilot a semi-automated production line which will provide opportunities to supply other solar farms across northern Australia with the Maverick solar array systems.
Phase two of the development will expand the facility to manufacture systems for the AAPL and establish a logistics and distribution centre to transport material and equipment by rail to Sun Cable’s proposed 14 GW solar farm site.
“This application is an important step in the ongoing development of the Australia-ASEAN Power Link, a solar energy infrastructure network that will provide Darwin and Singapore with competitively priced, dispatchable, high-volume renewable electricity from 2026 and 2027 respectively,” Sun Cable said in a statement.
Sun Cable is planning to build the manufacturing facility in Darwin’s East Arm Business Park – a location chosen due to its proximity to Darwin port and access to the Alice Springs to Darwin Railway – and said it will now work with ICN-NT to select a delivery partner for the project.
The development application is the latest step for the mega project, which shapes as Australia’s largest renewable energy infrastructure project.

The proposed AAPL includes a 14 GW solar farm to be developed on a 12,000-hectare site at Powell Creek. This would be coupled with an estimated 33 GWh of battery storage at the solar farm, in Darwin and in Singapore.
The project is expected to supply power to the Darwin region and to Singapore via a 4,500 km high-voltage direct-current transmission network, including a 750-kilometre overhead transmission line from the solar farm to Darwin and a 3,800km submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore, via Indonesia. The project is expected to generate enough renewable electricity to power more than 3 million homes a year.
The development application is the latest milestone for the project which has been awarded Major Project Status with the Northern Territory and Australian governments.
The Federal Government has also included the project on its Priority Initiative List while Sun Cable has already signed a project development agreement with the Northern Territory Government.
While the outlook for the project is favourable, there has been no indication from the company that any nation has signed up to purchase power from the project. Sun Cable however remains confident, saying construction for the project will begin immediately after financial close in October 2023, with commercial operations to commence in 2027.

Finding Infinity call it “A New Normal” and put on an independent exhibition at Melbourne Design Week that looks to demonstrate how Melbourne can become an entirely self-sufficient city by 2030, a demonstration with a solar pavilion at its centre. 
“Creating Space With Solar” is a solar pavilion and the centrepiece of “A New Normal City Hub” in downtown Melbourne. The brainchild of Mathew van Kooy, a partner at John Wardle Architects, the winner of the Melbourne Design Week Award provides a blueprint for the acceleration of Greater Melbourne’s transition from a consumer to a producer by 2030, a blueprint that calls for solar PV on every second rooftop in Melbourne. 
The solar pavilion itself consists of 68 260 W panels generating 56 kW/h daily and 18,000 kW/h annually, enough energy to power a 2030 Australian home for two years. Responding to the Design Week’s theme of “Design the World You Want”, van Kooy says “we created a pavilion that acts as a prototype…If all the rooftops in Greater Melbourne had solar panels, they could power 76% of the city. The pavilion is both a prototype and a pathway to a more sustainable future.” 
The solar array is accompanied by an artwork from Ash Keating Studio titled “A New Response,” which utilises vibrant colours as if light reflected from the solar panels had painted the adjacent wall. 
Melbourne is known for utilising its rooftop spaces for bars, restaurants and similar venues. With that in mind, there is a new solar architecture that could come into play, the tent-form, or perhaps we might call it the PV-Teepee. “The roofs that enclose them are steeply pitched to maximise the catchment area and to capture the sun.” The design tops off any space with the ability to provide the energy it needs, supporting a whole new layer of life in Melbourne. 

Behind the project entire is the plan to transition, and solar forms a vital piece of that. In addition to solar’s significant role in the electrification of transport, transitioning the grid and feeding energy storage, solar architecture is at the hard of the transformation. “Solar architecture is crucial to Melbourne becoming an energy producer,” the A New Normal Report states, “currently only one hundredth of solar PV potential within the Melbourne CBD has been realised…Maximising solar generation within the city reduces the need for new grid scale infrastructure…We need to expand take-up of PV in Melbourne significantly, aiming to cover every roof and unshaded facade that is financially viable and technically feasible.” 
Modelling from The Australian Photovoltaic Institute (APVI), the Institute of Sustainable Futures (ISF), and the University of New South Wales (UNSW), suggests Greater Melbourne is capable of generating 95% of its current energy needs through rooftop solar within its borders. 

Finding Infinity has therefore set a minimum target of installing solar PV on 50% of Melbourne’s rooftops. On rooftops with habitable space and plant space this may require agrivoltaic solutions and possibly facade PV. The report calls on government to incentivise the maximisation of rooftop space. 
According to the report achieving this goal would cost $22 billion, pay itself back in seven years, provide 42,500 jobs through to 2030 and 5,900 permanent jobs. 
The report also envisions a future in which the Latrobe Valley is heavily utilised with solar and wind generation, not just in commercial projects, but integrated with agriculture, horticulture and viticulture through agrivoltaics integration. 

Melbourne’s Lord Mayor, Sally Capp, said “Cities like Melbourne must play a leadership role in this ‘new normal’, working with our communities to demonstrate the social and economic advantages of new and better ways of thinking. We know Melbourne’s commitment to net zero emission by 2040 will be more important than ever to many people in the wake of our horrendous bushfires; a transition to 100% renewable energy for buildings and transport will play a major role in reaching that target.”
With a total required investment estimated at $100 billion, but an opportunity to generate approximately $14 billion in income annually, Melbourne’s transformation could pay for itself in less than a decade. 
The project will run to April 5 on the rooftop of 130 Little Collins Street.

In 2021, at a time when the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) is looking to tax solar feed-ins, VB is trying to set the world right, developing a platform in which solar owners can exchange their excess energy for slabs of the good stuff, the green grenades that are greener than ever before. 
VB, in partnership with Diamond Energy and Power Ledger, has launched Solar Exchange, a program allowing participants to exchange credit on their power bill – earned from generating excess solar – for beer. That’s right, the sunnier it is, the more free ice cold beer rains down upon you, which is to say, gets delivered to your door. You give VB solar, VB gives you slabs. 

“Last year we put the Australian sun to work and started brewing VB with 100% offset solar energy,” said Brian Phan, general manager marketing Victoria Bitter, “Now we’ve launched this Aussie-first program to thank those who have made the effort to go solar with some hard-earned VB.” 
“The only thing better than drinking the Big Cold Beer in the Aussie sun” continued Phan, “is earning beer while you do it. Plus it’s a real win-win for beer lovers and the environment.”

Basically, by utilising Power Ledger’s blockchain-powered platform for energy trading, VB will receive the excess solar credits on a solar owner’s energy bill from Diamond Energy and re-invest those credits into the program or other in-house sustainability efforts. 
Power Ledger’s co-founder and chairman Dr Jemma Green said that it was great their technology allowed solar owners to track how much beer they’ve earned (beer is delivered every quarter, like having four Christmases). “We are a global pioneer of peer-to-peer energy trading, and in a country that thrives on the beer economy, we are excited to be part of Australia’s first peer-to-beer energy exchange scheme.” 
We've partnered with Carlton United Breweries' @Vic_Bitter on the world's first peer-to-beer energy exchange, enabling Aussies to trade their excess solar energy for VB beer.

German renewables developer Baywa re has fleshed out some of the claims made about agrivoltaics by demonstrating the ability of solar panels to mitigate the effects of climate change on a redcurrant crop in the Netherlands.
Quite apart from the carbon emissions reduction represented by the clean energy generated by the 1.2 MWp array at Rini Kusters’ fruit farm in Wadenoijen, the structure has been observed to reduce extreme high temperatures on the crop and also shield the plants from damp.
“Weather excesses are becoming more and more common, and they are harmful to the plants,” said Kusters. “The development of fungus on the fruit due to a too-wet climate, for example, is a problem that is increasingly frequent.”
The expansion of what was installed as a pilot project last year has borne fruit, said the farmer. “On the hottest day last year it was 10 degrees [Celsius] cooler under the solar panels. On the wettest day, the plants remained dry. It’s a solution that I really believe in.”
Baywa, which yesterday said it has plans for 35 MWp of European agrivoltaics through next year, initially tested its solar array by shielding raspberries from the elements at Babberich, also in the Netherlands. The program was then expanded to several pilot schemes with the help of Wageningen University & Research, including Kusters’ crop, said Baywa in a press release issued to publicize the technology.
The solar array will replace the poly tunnels which typically protect such crops and Baywa said it is testing its application on other crops in Europe, including apples and pears.
“We had already created one of the largest and most technologically sophisticated ‘fruitvoltaic’ solutions in Europe in 2020, with our 2.67 MWp raspberry PV installation in Babberich,” said Stephan Schindele, product manager for agri-PV at BayWa. “Today, we are very excited to continue this fantastic journey and see our efforts rewarded by entering a new chapter of agri-PV with a new berry crop in Wadenoijen.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/01/solar-still-largely-underestimated/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 1, 2021",Solar still largely underestimated,"From pv magazine Global. 
The potential of solar PV to act as the main force to decarbonise the world’s energy mix is still being fully underestimated by different scenarios provided by several important institutions, including the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
This conclusion was drawn by two separate studies published this week by scientists at Aarhus University, in Denmark, and researchers from the German Aerospace Center (DLR).
In a study published in Joule, Aarhus University professor Marta Victoria and other scientists from universities and knowledge institutions in the U.S., Europe and Japan have shown how the 2050 integrated assessment modeling (IAM) scenarios from the IPCC have underestimated PV over the past 14 years, thus confirming the results of previous research conducted by scientists at the University of Geneva, in Switzerland. “Our paper reaches similar conclusions that the paper by [Marc] Jaxa-Rozen and [Evelina] Trutnevyte [did]” Victoria told pv magazine. “But we focus more on explaining the reasons behind that, which means the limitations of the model.”

The researchers analysed, in particular, the integrated assessment models and partial equilibrium models used by the IPCC experts and found that the estimated levelised cost of energy (LCOE) for the PV technology was set too high. “Solar PV modules have maintained a learning rate of 23% since 1976, i.e., their cost reduces by 23% every time the capacity [manufactured] doubles,” the paper notes.
“All the models used by the IPCC in [its] reports apply a cost that falls to a minimum of €1 per installed watt in the year 2050. However, the average cost today is already cheaper than this. In other words, 30 years before previously assumed,” Victoria stated. “The IPCC emphasises other energy sources and technologies and underestimates the contribution from solar cells.” According to her, the international institution should acknowledge the primary role of the PV technology in the global energy transition.
In another paper, published by Energy Strategy Reviews, researchers from the German Aerospace Center have compared cost assumptions for solar and wind technologies in global, regional, and national energy scenario studies from different institutions with the costs reported by the renewable energy industry. “Our results indicate that the trend of rapid cost declines has been structurally underestimated in virtually all future energy scenario analyses, and suggest that even the most recent studies refer to obsolete or very conservative values,” the authors of the study stated.
The German group selected scenarios that were released after 2015, including a long-term scenario of the energy system including the capacity structure for the power plant fleet, and provided cost estimates for capex and LCOE. “There are six regional or national studies that cover the USA, China, [the European] Union, India, Brazil, and South Africa, while the rest are … global,” the German paper specified. The studies were published by scientific researchers, government bodies, or non-governmental organisations including the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the European Commission, the Indian government, the International Energy Agency (IEA), and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), among others.
The paper notes that only one of the selected studies assumes that the LCOE of solar in 2050 will be lower than today’s auction values. “In other words, planning agencies use costs of PV for 2050 that have been invalidated in today’s market,” the paper’s authors emphasised.
They explained that the economic potential of solar and renewables keep being largely underestimated while energy transformation and mitigation costs, by contrast, are being overestimated. “Researchers should also update assumptions on economic lifetimes, full-load hours, systems’ degradation, and operation and maintenance costs,” concluded the German group.
