Such a scheme could set a threshold level for carbon emissions from the production process in order to classify it as being ‘clean’, similar to schemes in operation internationally, including in the United Kingdom and Europe.
In this Chart of the Week, we explore how ‘clean’ the hydrogen produced in Australia by a grid-connected electrolyser could be, depending on its location and change in variable renewable energy (VRE) penetration into the grid over time. Previously, we have also explored how the economics of grid-connected electrolysers can be improved through the addition of a battery or by accessing FCAS market revenues.
For a grid-connected hydrolyser, the emissions intensity of the hydrogen produced will be linked to the average emissions intensity of the grid’s generation sources at the time of its production. For benchmarking, we assume an electrolyser energy efficiency of 67% and use the U.K. Guarantee of Origin threshold (20 g CO2/MJ-H2, or 2.4 kg CO2/kg), which corresponds to a required grid emissions intensity of 48 kg CO2/MWh or below to produce hydrogen that meets the standard. For context, the average grid emissions intensity across New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland in 2022 is between 550-650 kg CO2/MWh.
As seen in the dashed lines in Figure 1, within the NEM, Tasmania is the only region where the average carbon intensity of the grid is already below the U.K. standard. According to our Benchmark Power Curve (BPC) forecasts, Victoria and South Australia will be the next two regions to fall below 48 kg CO2/MWh in 2035 and 2037, respectively, while NSW will follow in 2041. Queensland does not cross the threshold within the BPC forecast window to 2050. However, the recently announced Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan is expected to change this.

On a time-of-day basis, there is generally a higher share of VRE during the daytime hours, such that selectively producing hydrogen during the day would result in a ‘cleaner’ product. Wholesale energy prices are also generally lower during these times, so utilising lower daytime energy costs can be expected to reduce emissions intensity.
In the solid lines in Figure 1, we have modelled the carbon emissions over time from a 500 kW grid-connected electrolyser, capable of producing hydrogen at a maximum rate of 5 kg/hr but set to run at an averaged capacity factor of 30% (close to the typical capacity factor of solar and wind generators), with the simulation solving for the lowest cost of production. This analysis has not considered standby energy consumption (for keeping the electrolyser online while not actively producing hydrogen).
By utilising grid energy at the optimum times of the day, the emissions intensity of hydrogen produced in this scenario tracks ahead of the forecast of averaged grid emissions intensity over time, with hydrogen from SA crossing below the U.K. scheme threshold in 2031, Victoria in 2035 and NSW in 2036. Tasmanian-produced hydrogen is already well below the threshold, while Queensland-produced hydrogen still does not fall below the threshold within the forecast window.
Connecting a hydrogen electrolyser to the grid can offer several other benefits, including:

“We are losing money with this power station in the current environment,” AGL chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said on Thursday.
AGL said the decision was driven “in part” by the construction of the 900-kilometre EnergyConnect transmission link which is being built between South Australia and New South Wales and is expected to be ready by the middle of 2026.
The interconnector “will further impact gas-fired generation in South Australia and as a result the economic viability of the power station,” AGL said.
AGL mothballed one of the Torrens Island plant’s four units in October 2021. The remaining three units are now to be retired on June. 30, 2026, instead of 2035 as previously planned.
The decision to fast track the closure of the gas-fired power plant is the latest step in AGL’s strategy to transition from traditional baseload energy generation to more flexible sources as it navigates the shift to renewable energy.

The move comes just days after AGL announced that the 250 MW/250 MWh Torrens Island battery being developed at the site is one step closer to “full functionality,” after getting approval to start the energisation process.
AGL said it had received permission from the Australian Energy Market Operator to start energising the battery’s 275 kV cable and main transformer.
“That means the battery’s auxiliary equipment can now be progressively energised to facilitate commissioning, a key step before connecting the battery itself,” the company said.
The battery is part of AGL’s strategy to transform its Torrens Island site into a low-carbon industrial energy hub.
AGL said in the past four years it has invested $475 million (USD 320 million) in major energy projects on Torrens Island, including the big battery and the 210 MW Barker Inlet Power Station, which opened in 2019.
AGL also recently announced a feasibility study into the development of a green hydrogen facility at Torrens Island.
“Torrens Island will continue to play a crucial role in AGL’s current energy requirements and future generation plans as the site is transformed into an integrated industrial energy hub,” the company said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/24/lg-solar-battery-recall-expanded-nsw-reports-battery-fire-spike/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,LEGAL,QUALITY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 24, 2022","LG solar battery recall expanded, NSW reports battery fire spike","National watchdog the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is setting about directly contacting Australians who may have faulty solar batteries in their home, urging households to check serial numbers as the national recall has now been expanded to include new models, affected systems and dates of manufacture.
The ACCC said batteries may be branded LG, SolaX, Opal, Redback, RedEarth, Eguana, or VARTA, though a number of these brands including RedEarth and Redback clarified their work with the ACCC has previously been completed.*
So far, about 2,900 batteries have been replaced or removed from consumers’ properties, according to the ACCC. A further 1,400 batteries have been switched off or have had the maximum charge capacity reduced to 75% to minimise the risk overheating while they wait for a replacement or refund.
LG and SolaX are still trying to trace around 3,000 additional recalled batteries.

LG will replace recalled batteries manufactured between 29 March 2017 and 13 September 2018 free of charge. Alternatively, consumers can opt for a refund and have the recalled battery removed from their property at no cost. Households who have higher electricity bills as a result of not being able to use their battery as expected will also be compensated by LG, the ACCC says.
“Unfortunately, since October 2019 there have been nine reported incidents involving these types of batteries in Australia resulting in property damage and one injury,” ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard said.
LG has also told the ACCC it has identified about 10,000 additional batteries, manufactured from 21 January 2016 to 28 March 2017 and from 14 September 2018 to 30 June 2019, that may be at risk of overheating. To address this risk, LG will install diagnostic software to detect abnormal behaviour in battery cells pre-emptively. Faulty batteries, if identified by the software, will then be replaced for free. Electrical safety regulators are currently assessing LG’s proposed diagnostic software remedy, the ACCC said.
The revised recall comes on the same week Fire and Rescue New South Wales released a notice warning shoppers to be vigilant about batteries, as its crews had responded to over 180 lithium-ion battery fires since Jan. 1, 2022. This is compared with just over 16 in 2021, more than a 10-fold increase.
The NSW fire service did, however, note the majority of incidents were in small, portable devices like e-bikes and e-scooters.
The fire risk of lithium battery makeups has been a divisive issue in the industry, with some labelling it anti-renewable “fear mongering” while experts like UK Newcastle University Professor Paul Christensen believe the risks require serious consideration. In Australia, cognisance around lithium battery risks took on a new light when Neoen’s Victoria Big Battery caught fire during commissioning in 2021. 
While these concerns have served as a leg up for non-flammable battery makeups, like flow batteries, lithium-ion remains predominant due to its commercial availability and high energy density.
*Article amended on November 25 to clarify which brands are included in the recall. Additional brands listed by the ACCC are not  necessarily part of the recall. Both RedEarth and RedBack batteries stopped using LG components a number of years ago and their batteries are not part of the renewed recall campaign.

NHCE founder Tony Schultz said the Strategic Manufacturing Cooperation Agreement will see the two companies conduct a feasibility study and work toward a final investment decision on a 50:50 joint venture to manufacture VRFBs in Australia.
“NHCE and CellCube will collectively review and select the best sites to deliver initial annual production capacity of at least 40 MW/160 MWh, with a target of 1,000 MW/8,000 MWh per year and creating more than 200 new jobs in the short term,” he said.
Schultz said the partnership will target Australian commercial and industrial projects for the potential use of VRFB technology to meet demand driven by Australia’s rapid build out of utility-scale variable renewable energy and the accelerated shutdown of baseload coal-fired generators.
“We believe there are two factors behind our belief that VRFB is the right grid-energy storage technology to install in Australia at scale,” Schultz said. “The first is that VRFB technology, having been developed in Australia at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in the mid-1980s, is now on the road to being an accepted alternative battery energy storage technology globally while the second is Australia’s abundant vanadium resources.”
The first project executed by the partnership will be developing Australia’s largest VRFB, with a 4 MW/16 MWh VRFB system to be installed at an industrial customer’s site to showcase the various applications of CellCube’s proprietary technology.

CellCube said VRFB technology offers a viable alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), claiming on a levelised cost of storage basis, VRFBs already outperform LIBs while having none of the drawbacks associated with them. The company said flow batteries are inherently non-flammable or explosive and the chemistry is non-degradable and has an almost infinite life. Even when an end-of-life scenario for an individual deployed energy storage system is envisioned, the medium can be reused.
NHCE Executive Director of Development Steve Banning said the agreement’s objective is to provide 24/7 green power supply arrangements to support industrial and commercial customers looking to increase their use of renewable energy sources, and who face severe issues on power quality, grid constraints, rising network costs and high-power prices.
“We will be warranting the systems produced for 20,000 cycles or approximately 20 years of use,” he said.
CellCube Chief Executive Alexander Schoenfeldt said the partnership supports the company’s vision of large-scale production and deployment of VRFBs as the preferred energy storage technology long term.
“This cooperation with NHCE follows our business strategy to strengthen regional partnership, create a local product offering and enhance our work with Australian supply chain partners to build well-designed megawatt microgrids,” he said.
“In addition, Australia has around 20% of known global vanadium resources and it makes economic sense to use local vanadium instead of importing it from elsewhere.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/24/energy-optimiser-solaredge-expands-into-full-home-solution/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,INSTALLATIONS,INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"NOVEMBER 24, 2022",Energy optimiser SolarEdge expands into full home solution,"pv magazine: SolarEdge recently exhibited at the All-Energy conference in Melbourne. What’s the intel on how customer thinking has evolved over the past couple of years?
Gavin Merchant: A lot of customers are interested in SolarEdge home battery, which is our latest product this year, but real smart home systems are a big focus at the moment.
SolarEdge is most renowned for its solar optimisation technology. How has it built out from there?
SolarEdge started with optimised inverters. A SolarEdge system comprises an optimiser which converts the energy at the roof level and then provides the electricity for the inverter which is the conversion brain. Our aim has always been to make more solar energy accessible to the user. Over time, our inverters have been developed into a more comprehensive suite of load controls, home automation, EV charging, batteries, backup — a full suite. 
We also now provide solar panels, so we have this one-vendor solution for SolarEdge Home. 
A few companies now have the full-stack residential solution, and digital smart home managers are proliferating. How is SolarEdge Home different?
Other companies have a home solution that includes solar panels, batteries and some level of control. But this integrated, optimised solution is something that SolarEdge really invented. It was an industry first, when SolarEdge started with the concept in 2012, and now our Home Hub Inverter solution uses one inverter to manage solar energy, modular battery storage and smart consumption. 
The point to really clarify here is that often people think of smart homes as being able to turn on and off all those low power consumption devices like televisions, washing machines or lights, but we see the smart home as being able to truly control large loads, like pool pumps, air conditioners, EVs, and batteries, prioritising when and where you use your energy. 
Image: SolarEdge
Inverter manufacturers have had some challenges in responding to regulations on how their products integrate with and respond to the grid in Australia. How has SolarEdge managed the changes?
It hasn’t been arduous for the Australian team. Our personnel have helped write some of the standards for Australia, and SolarEdge is able to respond quite quickly to any mandated changes. For example, in South Australia, changes were recently put in place to enable dynamic control of voltage. We’re able to remotely adjust our deployed inverters because they’re live connected. We can even do remote fleet upgrades across the country, so we’re quite fortunate in having the power of that system to be able to respond to changing regulations.
How is Australia’s battery market viewed by SolarEdge?
We launched our SolarEdge Home Battery in Australia this year and it’s been extremely successful. We’ve installed over 1,000 units already and we’re looking for very rapid growth next year as well.
Battery prices were forecast to reduce as production and sales scaled, but that’s no longer the case, is it? How are market dynamics nonetheless favouring battery adoption?
Prices are going up and it’s mainly attributable to raw materials. At the moment there are supply shortages of lithium because of the global adoption of EVs. So there are constraints on raw materials, then add inflation and rising logistical costs, and we’ve seen prices increase. I think that will stabilise and we’ll see some efficiencies come through in the next few years, though probably not next year. 
Still, the economics are very much in favour of batteries at the moment because we’re seeing the price of electricity go up. The federal government forecast 58% rise over the next 18 months, which is significant. So customers are looking to maximise self consumption of their solar electricity; they want to store the excess that they generate during the day to use at night. 
What’s the differentiating premise behind SolarEdge batteries?
It’s very simple. We have a 10 kWh battery delivering a 98% efficiency round trip. Then, our batteries are stackable. So on the one inverter, you can have 10, 20 or 30 kilowatt hours.
I think Australians really like to be independent, and they like to have security of supply. One thing that’s not widely known is that just having a battery installed doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have access to stored power when the grid goes down. You must have a backup capability, a backup circuit, which SolarEdge has been offering since 2016.

Beyond empowering the independent home, SolarEdge has a strong presence in commercial and industrial (C&I) solar systems. What are you targeting there?
Our forte is what we call the C&I Rooftop. So far, we’ve had success in Australia with systems of up to five megawatts. Clients are very interested in SolarEdge because of its safety aspect. Optimisers offer an inherent safety technology and rapid shutdown, which is important to business owners who are looking to ensure safety on their rooftops. You know, if they’ve got people on the roof, maybe maintenance people working on other equipment such as air con, they want to be confident that the roof is de-energised.
Also optimiser technology allows you to utilise all available rooftop areas. On industrial roofs, you have soft zones created by roof access, stacks, air conditioning units — the topography can be very complex. You might also have shading from other buildings. So shading is a big deal. Using optimisers, you don’t have those areas of darkness that would be unavailable to traditional PV systems. We’re able to put more capacity on the roof and obviously you get more generation from that. 
SolarEdge is attractive to the Australian C&I market because of these features. And I expect that in 2023 with electricity prices going as much as 6 times higher for power purchase agreements, we’ll see a really big uptake of commercial solar systems.
How is SolarEdge managing supply chains, manufacturing and delivery to customers in the current environment?
The majority of our product is produced by contract manufacturing, but SolarEdge also has in-house manufacturing at a state of the art facility in the north of Israel.
I was there in June. It’s fully automated. Every component is pre-qualified and tested and then every sub assembly is tested and burnt in and then the final assembly is tested before it goes to the customer. So every product is perfect out of the factory. 
We also have factories in Mexico, Vietnam, China and Eastern Europe. It’s very much a global company, which helps support the business through supply challenges. The world has changed a lot again this year, and we need to be able to adapt quite quickly with a company of this size.
I started with SolarEdge in 2015 and we’ve seen a lot of development over the years. SolarEdge has been innovating very rapidly and has grown to become a multi-billion dollar company.

The two companies, which earlier this year announced plans to develop a renewable energy “superhybrid” project in Queensland, also confirmed they would be investigating other long-duration energy storage technologies, including flow batteries, solar thermal, compressed air, and hydrogen storage.
Sunshine Hydro Chair Michael Myer said the new JV had been formed in response to the accelerated closure of Victoria’s coal-fired power plants and the support given by the state government for new sources of clean energy generation as part of its ambition to reach 95% renewables by 2035.
“Our aim is to replace the dispatchable capacity which will be lost once the coal-fired power stations in the Latrobe Valley retire and support the development of a green hydrogen industry in Victoria,” he said.
“If the last few months have taught us anything it is that we need a lot more long-duration energy storage, not just to keep the lights on but to keep energy prices down. As we rapidly electrify and move away from fossil fuels, we need to all understand that building new large-scale deep energy storage is vital – for consumers and industry.”
The new JV builds on the existing partnership between the companies in Queensland where they are jointly developing a “superhybrid” project which would incorporate 1.8 GW of wind generation and 600 MW of pumped hydro with 18 hours of storage. The Djandori gung-i project, being developed near Miriam Vale in central Queensland, would also include 300 MW of hydrogen electrolysers, 50 MW of liquefaction, and a 50 MW hydrogen fuel cell.
The two companies said they have secured the land for the Queensland project and expect to make a final investment decision in 2025, with energy production likely to start from 2028.
No details were provided about locations for the Victorian projects but the companies said their initial focus will be on the state’s central regions.
Energy Estate co-founder Simon Currie said the developers will focus on how to “maximise the repurposing of existing transmission infrastructure in areas like the Latrobe Valley and how we can achieve enduring outcomes by using systems thinking to integrate projects to deliver multiple energy products and services.”
Currie said as well as exploring opportunities in Victoria and Queensland, Energy Estate and Sunshine Hydro intend to extend their collaboration into other markets in Australia and globally.
“At the heart of our joint venture with Sunshine Hydro is a commitment to partner with local communities, workers and traditional owners,” he said. “We can’t get to a cleaner future without building new projects and infrastructure but we can promise to do this in a way which puts outcomes for communities, workforces and the environment first.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/24/building-renewables-emits-carbon-but-building-them-faster-emits-far-less/,"RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 24, 2022","Building renewables emits carbon, but building them faster emits far less","From pv magazine USA
The construction of clean energy components produces carbon emissions. New research by Columbia University Climate School’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory looks at just how much carbon the world could emit as it mines, manufactures, transports, constructs, and maintains solar and wind resources.
The report shows that emissions related to the energy transition are non-negligible, but there is a positive feedback loop in which the faster we build, the less emissions we produce. Having non-emitting power on hand to build more renewable energy resources will only lower the embodied emissions and stem the tide of climate change more rapidly. The researchers published their findings in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The amount of emissions tied to an electricity generating facility from raw materials to operations is often referred to as “carbon backpack.” The current pace of renewables buildout is currently predicted to lead to about a 2.7 C temperature increase by 2100, resulting in 185 billion tons of carbon backpack. This is equivalent to about five or six years of global emissions at current rates. 
The backpack is lighter with a more aggressive path. If humanity is to build infrastructure quickly enough to limit global warming to 2 C, which international agreements aiming to come under the 2 C mark, the carbon backpack would be cut nearly in half to 95 billion tons by 2100. If the energy transition exceeds all expectations and we limit temperature rise to 1.5 C, the carbon backpack would be more of a handbag – amounting to 20 billion tons by 2100, or about six months of current global emissions.
“The message is that it is going to take energy to rebuild the global energy system, and we need to account for that,” said researcher Corey Lesk. “Any way you do it, it’s not negligible. But the more you can initially bring on renewables, the more you can power the transition with renewables.”
Lesk and his colleagues said that these are likely conservative estimates. The study includes generation-side emissions, and omits the cost of deploying energy storage and transmission. Distributed energy resources require much less of this type of infrastructure than centralised power, so the profile of solar and wind projects will impact this outcome greatly.
The study also modelled carbon emissions from adapting to sea-level rise. It found that construction of sea walls and moving cities inland where necessary would generate 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide by 2,100 under the 2 C scenario. More energy will need to be expended to control inland flooding, irrigation in areas that might become drier, and adapting buildings to higher temperature extremes.
Lesk remains optimistic. He said that given cost decreases in recent years for renewable technologies, 80% to 90% of what the world needs could be installed in the next few decades, especially if current subsidies for fossil-fuel production are diverted to renewables.
This global clean energy transition is estimated to cost USD 3.5 trillion per year every year through 2050 in order to reach net-zero emissions, according to one study, or up to about USD 14 trillion for the United States alone in the same timeframe, according to another report.
“Despite these limitations, we conclude that the magnitude of CO2 emissions embedded in the broader climate transition are of geophysical and policy relevance,” said the researchers. “Transition emissions can be greatly reduced under faster-paced decarbonisation, lending new urgency to policy progress on rapid renewable energy deployment.”
