France-based start-up Energiestro has developed a storage technology for residential PV based on a flywheel system based on concrete.
A flywheel system is able to store electricity by converting it into kinetic energy using a motor to spin a rotor. The flywheel rotates at such a high speed that the electrical power is transformed into mechanical power.
The proposed solution consists of a hollow, solid cylinder that is rotated around an axis and connected to an electric motor and generator. “When you have the energy to store, the engine drives the flywheel, which accelerates,” said the company’s co-founder and general director, André Gennesseaux. “In the other direction, the motor can act as a brake to discharge the electricity.”
To date, according to the manufacturer, most of the steering wheels used for this kind of storage were made of steel. “But steel flywheels have a limit: their price, while stationary storage users are looking, above all, for the best costs,” Gennesseaux explained. “Some companies are also developing carbon cylinders, which are much lighter but, again, very expensive while our approach is not to work primarily on the weight because in this type of applications, it does not matter.”
According to the general director, carbon flywheels currently cost around €250/kWh, steel flywheels €200/kWh and concrete ones around a few euros. “The particularity of our patented technology is that the concrete cylinder is pre-stressed by a winding of fibreglass and is held in a vacuum to avoid friction,” Gennesseaux stated. Thanks to this, maintenance operations are reduced because the mechanical part is sealed and the lubricating oil is also in a vacuum environment, without risk of oxidation.
The flywheel is guaranteed for 30 years and a change of its inverter is expected after 15 years. “At the beginning, we chose concrete for price reasons, but we quickly found that its life cycle analysis was also positive,” Gennesseaux went on to say. “We are around 10 grams of CO2 per kWh, while lithium-ion batteries are around 40g CO2/kWh, at the same level as steel flywheels.”
Currently, Energiestro offers a standard storage solution with a nominal power of around 10 kW, which corresponds to a charge and discharge cycle in one hour.
The steering wheel has a diameter of one meter and weighs three tons, and can be placed in the garden of a private house.
The system capacity should be increased, initially, to 20 kWh, and then 50 kWh, to eventually reach 24 hours of storage. “The size limit will be given by logistics as we have to find cranes capable of burying the flywheels in the ground, which is why we are limiting ourselves to 50 kWh in our current business plan,” Gennesseaux added, noting that the solution will be initially offered in France’s overseas territories and Africa.
The French company received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program. “As a beta-test, we have a demonstration project with Voltalia in Guyana,” Gennesseaux said. “In this context, we will install a 10 kWh flywheel which will manage fluctuations on the network for one hour if a cloud passes.”
According to him, in hot and humid regions, the steering wheels are much more robust and reliable than lithium-ion batteries. The company is also working in partnership with Engie on the Thémis solar power plant project in the Pyrénées-Orientales (3.4 MWp) where several 10 kWh flywheels will be installed with the objective of verifying the impact of this technology in frequency regulation, compared to lithium-ion batteries.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/22/australia-businesses-unhappy-with-electricity-contacts-with-62-keen-to-switch-survey-finds/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 22, 2021","Australian businesses ‘unhappy’ with electricity contacts with 62% keen to switch, survey finds","The survey found expensive rates, inflexibility, and a lack of routes to better control their energy usage were the main causes for complaint. The survey was commissioned by retailer and energy management company Flow Power, which highlighted that a strong majority of businesses (62%) would switch electricity providers if they were “given more options”.
“Our findings come at a time when renewable energy is becoming more and more available to Australian businesses and yet businesses feel shut out of the market,” Flow Power CEO Matthew van der Linden said.
“Flexibility is also hugely important to many businesses, with 46% of survey respondents telling us that they would be prepared to pay an additional two to three percent above market rate in their electricity contract to enable them to pay a lower rate when the market price dips,” he added.
Australia’s electricity provider market is dominated by AGL and Origin, both of which, especially AGL, have come under heavy fire recently for coal usage. Around 2008, electricity bills in Australia shot up, rising 117% between 2008 and 2018 – four times the average price increase across other sectors.
The high price of electricity has, however, supported the rise of solar with Australia now leading the world in rooftop solar capacity. Businesses, also known as the C&I segment, have not taken up solar with the same vigour.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/22/asia-pacific-to-hit-1-7-trillion-in-renewable-investments-by-2030-but-australias-to-fall-60-before-then-woodmac/,"MARKETS,POLICY,ASIA,OCEANIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 22, 2021",Asia Pacific to hit $1.7 trillion in renewable investments by 2030 but Australia’s to fall 60% before then: Woodmac,"The Asia Pacific region stretches all the way from Kazakhstan, Iran and Sri Lanka on the western edges to New Zealand, Fuji and Japan, and includes China, India and, of course, Australia. Australia has historically been the region’s renewable energy frontrunner, but consultancy and analysis company Wood Mackenzie expects renewable investments in the country to decrease substantially over the next five years.
In fact, it expects Australia’s wind and solar investments to drop by 60% in that period, before picking up again in the 2030s to average out around AU$9.3 billion a year.
“Australia is a leader in the energy transition in the Asia Pacific. The country has the highest variable renewable energy share in generation now and will accelerate the share from 20% in 2020 to 78% by 2050. The country is closing ageing coal-fired plants and facing reliability and cost challenges at least ten years earlier than other Asian countries,” Woodmac senior analyst, Le Xu, said.

Though Woodmac analysts did not detail the reasons behind the dramatic forecasted drop in Australian investments over the next five years, the predictions presumably stem from the fact the high penetration of renewables, namely solar, in the country has pushed electricity prices down to new daytime lows and caused major congestion issues on the grid, delaying numerous large-scale projects. Australia’s Commonwealth-run renewable energy schemes are also winding down and are scheduled to be phased out by 2030.
Unlike Australia, which already has a developed economy and renewables market, many of the other countries that populate the Asia Pacific region are still growing their economies. This coupled with population growth has seen the region labelled the future “engine room” of global power demand. The region is expected to account for nearly two-thirds of global power demand growth to 2050, according to previous Woodmac analysis.

“Asia Pacific power generation investments are leading the world and expected to hit US$2.4 trillion [AU$3.2 trillion] in the current decade, with renewables accounting for over half or US$1.3 trillion [AU$1.7 trillion] of power investments. We expect coal to make up 55% of fossil fuel investments until 2030 but shrink to 30% in the 2030s as gas dominates,” Woodmac’s research director Alex Whitworth said at the company’s Asia Pacific Power and Renewables Conference.
Nonetheless, as subsidies for renewable energy are rolled back across Asia, Woodmac forecasts in most of the region’s markets renewably generated power will not be able to compete with with coal power until 2025 or later.

 
Woodmac expects the top contributors to wind and solar investments in Asia Pacific will be mainland China, Japan, India, South Korea and Taiwan. “China’s 1,200 GW of wind and solar capacity target by 2030 will require more than 534 GW of renewables to be added over the next decade. This will boost annual wind capacity to over 40 GW from 2021 to 2030,” Woodmac’s Principal consultant Xiaoyang Li said.
In the decade to 2030, it foresees annual additional wind and solar capacities will average around 140 GW per year, accounting for two-thirds of average total power capacity additions in the region by 2030. 
Composed of 11 different countries, southeast Asia includes Brunei, Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Woodmac expects southeast Asia will collectively require around AU$18.6 billion a year of wind and solar investments to 2040, forming just under half of total power investments. 
“Southeast Asia is one of the hottest solar market regions in the world, with installed capacity more than doubling every year since 2018. There will be a momentary slow down with subsidies pulled back, but the region will add over 100 GW of solar in the next ten years,” Senior analyst at Woodmac, Rishab Shrestha, said

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/22/fortescue-signs-contract-with-tasports-progressing-250-mw-green-hydrogen-plant-in-bell-bay/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,TASMANIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 22, 2021",Fortescue signs contract with TasPorts progressing 250 MW green hydrogen plant in Bell Bay,"The Tasmanian Ports Corporation, commonly known as TasPorts, today announced it had signed an Option Agreement with Fortescue Future Industries for its export-scale green hydrogen plant planned for Bell Bay in northern Tasmania. The non-binding contract will allow Fortescue Future Industries to “exclusively negotiate” all land and operating access requirements with the state-owned authority, with Fortescue saying the contract marks “an important milestone” in the project’s development. 
Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), which is owned by Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest and chaired by former prime minister Malcom Turnbull, in May signed an agreement with Japan’s IHI Corporation to jointly undertake feasibility studies looking into 250 MW green hydrogen and ammonia production facility at Bell Bay which could supply to Japan in addition to domestic markets. The proposed project would have the capacity to produce 250,000 tonnes of green ammonia per year.
“FFI’s Tasmania green hydrogen project could be one of the world’s largest green hydrogen plants when commissioned, creating a significant export market for green hydrogen from Australia,” Fortescue Future Industries’ CEO, Julie Shuttleworth, said in a statement today.
“The signing of this agreement with TasPorts marks the beginning of a ground-breaking partnership, aiming for the first export of green hydrogen from an Australian port.
“After investing in research and feasibility studies, we are serious about utilising Tasmania’s comparative advantage in renewable energy generation,” Shuttleworth added.
Anthony Donald, Chief Executive Officer of TasPorts – a state-owned authority that manages all of Tasmania’s 11 ports – said the contract it has entered into with Fortescue will enable commercial growth opportunities for Tasmania. “Securing land is one of the critical ingredients to enable the realisation of green hydrogen developments at Bell Bay and TasPorts is proud to be taking a lead role to support the renewable energy industry,” Donald said.
Fortescue Future Industries noted economic analysis by consultancy Deloitte found the first 250 MW stage of this Bell Bay project could deliver a net $2 billion increase to gross state product over the its life and create an estimated 500 full-time jobs during development, construction and operation stages.
The Bell Bay project is targeted for an investment decision by the Fortescue Board in 2021.
Fortescue Future Industries isn’t the only company looking to use Bell Bay for hydrogen production and export. As an Advanced Manufacturing Zone, Bell Bay is Tasmania’s premier centre of manufacturing. Over 59% of Tasmania’s exports are produced in the Bell Bay area and it is Tasmania’s largest industrial precinct.
Three other major hydrogen projects are being proposed for the area in addition to Fortescue’s 250 MW facility. One of those belongs to giant and rival Origin, which is looking to build a green hydrogen and ammonia plant double the size at 500 MW. Origin is currently undertaking feasibility studies into the project, which have been supported by a $1.6 million grant from the Tasmanian Government.
Abel Energy is also considering an 100 MW electrolysis plant in Bell Bay, though unlike the majority of Australia’s other proposed hydrogen projects, Abel is targeting methanol production. Michael van Baarle, Abel Energy’s co-founder and CEO told the Australian Hydrogen Conference in May that the company is opting to export methanol, which contains four hydrogen atoms, as it has an “established market” as a chemical feedstock and fuel. Van Baarle also noted demand for methanol tripled in the last 16 years.
Abel Energy’s Bell Bay project also received funding for its feasibility studies from the state’s government under its Tasmanian Renewable Hydrogen Fund.
Petroleum company Woodside is also proposing its H2TAS project in Bell Bay, which at this stage involves a 10 MW production pilot which would see hydrogen blended into natural gas networks. Woodside says the project could eventually be scaled to 250 MW.
TasPorts, in its statement about its new contract with Fortescue, said: “Tasmania has an abundance of existing and expandable renewable energy resources and the Port of Bell Bay provides a perfect opportunity to support the export of green hydrogen, with land availability and access to a deep-water port.
“Further opportunities exist within the industrial precinct and TasPorts is continuing to work with other proponents as it supports the Government’s Tasmanian Renewable Hydrogen Action Plan,” it added.
Fortescue Future Industries said it plans to commence community engagement sessions in late July 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/22/commonwealth-opens-crucial-discussion-on-hydrogen-certification/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"JUNE 22, 2021",Commonwealth opens crucial discussion on hydrogen certification,"The Federal Government has released a discussion paper on an Australian hydrogen Guarantee of Origin certification scheme (GO scheme) as part of its National Hydrogen Strategy. A scheme that would seek to measure and track emissions from hydrogen production, which is to say, a scheme that would enable the clear distinction between green, blue, grey and brown hydrogen production. 
At the recent pv magazine Roundtables Europe 2021 event, Aurélie Beauvais, Deputy CEO SolarPower Europe noted one of the most important aspects of the development of green hydrogen at the moment is certification, which is to say, how we can know whether a hydrogen molecule is green or blue or grey or brown. “How can we define and certify renewable hydrogen,” Beauvais said, “and how can we make sure we are not double-counting the electron that’s produced?” 
In a recent forecast which predicted Australia’s low-carbon hydrogen export revenue could reach US$90 billion by 2050, Wood MacKenzie’s head of markets and transitions, Prakesh Sharma, “a stable and reliable source of low-carbon hydrogen supply becomes essential because it is impossible to tell how a given molecule of hydrogen has been produced. A guarantee of origin is therefore crucial to allow for minimal environmental impact, i.e., carbon leakage.” 
“Standards also help with risk assessment and transparent market pricing,” Sharma continued. “Australia stands to benefit as rules of hydrogen shipping, transport, storage and product quality are set and accepted internationally.” 
The Government’s approach outlines methodologies related to three main hydrogen production pathways: electrolysis, coal gasification with carbon capture and storage (CCS), and steam methane reforming with CCS. However the paper does mention the scheme’s likely need to evolve in the future to include further pathways and aspects of the hydrogen value chain such as storage, transport, downstream products and energy carriers such as ammonia. 
Of course, as the GO scheme is a product of the National Hydrogen Strategy, it is technology neutral, meaning hydrogen produced with emissions captured and stored is equally as green as hydrogen produced renewably. 
The scheme, which the government is working on as a member of the International Partnership for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells in the Economy’s (IPHE) Hydrogen Production Analysis Taskforce, is looking to build on the European CertifHy approach, which sets a minimum of emissions intensity and is currently in its third phase, EU-wide deployment. 
There are other GO schemes at various levels of advancement including Germany’s TUV SUD, France’s AFHYPAC, and GOs for fuels in general exist in North America, Taiwan and Singapore, although hydrogen is not specifically included. 
As yet, the government’s discussion paper rehearses a short history of stakeholder survey which resulted in its deciding on setting up an initial IPHE aligned domestic scheme (as opposed to a scheme developed with a trade partner or aligned with CertifHy) which would transition to an international scheme over time. 
The GO would be certified based on data reported over a 12-month period and according to a tonne of hydrogen, accounting for emissions (scope 1 and 2), the facility and location, the production technology and the primary fuel source. 
The paper proposes to use voluntarily surrendered Large-scale Generation Certificates (LGCs) issued under the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET) to track and verify renewable electricity claims of hydrogen producers. This proposed usage requires “an agreed understanding of what these certificates represent being 1 MWh of eligible renewable energy generation.” 
The paper uses the example of a grid-connected hydrogen producer in Queensland who voluntarily surrenders an LGC from a wind farm in Victoria. Because the producer is grid-connected, the actual electrons it is consuming would be a mix produced by coal, gas, renewables and other technologies. However, following a market-based method of emissions accounting whereby the percentage of electricity consumption attributed to the LRET is taken from the Renewable Power Percentage (RPP) for the given reporting year. So if the Renewable Power Percentage is 18.5 and the Queensland producer used 1,000 MWh of electricity for that reporting year, it may list 185 MWh as zero emissions. The zero emissions benefit would still be attributed to the Victorian grid. 
The paper concedes long term limitations on the use of Large-scale Generation Certificates in that it would not be internationally adaptable and the certificates cannot be created under the Renewable Energy Target legislation after 2030, when it is scheduled to be exited. So the paper suggests a further approach which would see the establishment of a “renewable GO certificate”, used to track and verify below-baseline renewable electricity. 
“A renewable GO certificate could be voluntarily surrendered using the Renewable Electricity Certificate (REC) Registry which is administered by the Clean Energy Regulator (CER). 
The Australian Hydrogen Council (AHC) welcomed the government’s discussion paper by saying that hydrogen certification “is crucial to build a credible hydrogen industry”, with AHC CEO Fiona Simon agreeing that the Clean Energy Regulator “is a credible and established body which would be well suited to administering the scheme in Australia.” 
“The AHC is eager to see a certification approach locked down in 2021” continued Simon, “so that producers and consumers can rest assured that Australia has a credible, valuable and differentiated hydrogen product.” 
The Clean Energy Council (CEC) similarly welcomed the consultation on GO scheme, noting that such a scheme “will be critical for Australia’s hydrogen producers to demonstrate to customers that their hydrogen is renewable or zero emissions.” 
“It’s clear that international customers and trading partners have a preference for renewable hydrogen,” said the CEC in a statement, “and we expect that over time customers will also be willing to pay a price premium for this renewable product. It is therefore critical that we can differentiate renewable hydrogen from other fuel-based sources.” 
The CEC is also supportive of the CER’s credibility and “we support the proposal for the CER to lead the administration of this scheme.” 
The Australian Government today finally, finally released its discussion paper on certification of #hydrogen projects. It was due to be released in 2020.
The discussion paper is welcomed, but we have strong concerns.
Here are our thoughts (a thread):
— SmartEnergyCouncil (@SmartEnergyCncl) June 21, 2021

CEO of the Smart Energy Council, John Grimes, however, voiced concern around the government’s technology agnosticism and embrace of hydrogen made with fossil fuels. “It’s disappointing that the Australian Government is so focused on hydrogen from coal and fossil gas, rather than renewable hydrogen, renewable ammonia and renewable energy [and] the paper provides no certainty for renewable hydrogen, ammonia & metals producers & buyers,” Grimes said in response to the news.
“The discussion paper is a useful, if long-delayed, start by the Australian Government on critical certification issues but it reinforces our view that the Government is failing Australians by refusing to develop a national energy or a national climate change policy or to commit to strong short and long-term emission reductions strategies.”
He added that it was “disappointing” the government did not once mention the Smart Energy Council’s Zero Carbon Certification Scheme, which now has 12 Australian and international founding partner institutions and companies.
Both the Smart Energy Council and the Clean Energy Regulator have said they look forward to cooperating on guaranteeing the origin of Australian hydrogen, with the Regulator seeing its role as providing government-backed certificates, leaving plenty of space for players like the Smart Energy Council to distribute and validate those.
Read the discussion paper and have your say on our consultation hub. Submissions close on 30 July 2021.

The green hydrogen project, HySustain, uses electrolysis of demineralised water and solar energy. AGV’s intention behind HySustain is to use project-specific solar farms to provide 100% of the renewable resources needed for green hydrogen production. In turn, the VRFB will enable large, scalable and long-life energy storage.
TNG’s managing director and CEO, Paul Burton, said that the company is very “pleased to have secured this Heads of Agreement with AGV Energy, opening up an exciting pathway to collaborate with them on the development of their exciting green hydrogen HySustain technology.”
Burton said that HySustain is a “great opportunity to showcase an integrated VRFB storage solution. We also intend to work with AGV Energy on the potential rollout of HySustain in Australia, given the significant momentum within Australia and the resources industry to move towards a hydrogen-based economy.”
Through an already incorporated joint venture with Singaporean-based battery technology and development company, V-Flow Tech (V-Flow), TNG is also looking to develop its VRFB business throughout regional Australia.

Solar manufacturers Jinko Energy and JA Solar Technology are each set to acquire a stake in the Xinte Energy unit which is planning to have a 100,000-tonne-annual-capacity polysilicon fab up and running within two years.
The Chinese manufacturers will each hand over RMB315 million (AU$64 million) for a 9% stake in the Inner Mongolia Xinte unit of TBEA-owned poly manufacturer Xinte Energy. With the parent company injecting a further RMB2.81 billion (AU$578 million), the subsidiary’s registered capital will rise from RMB60 million (AU$12 million) to RMB3.5 billion (AU$7 million), provided Xinte Energy shareholders approve the plan.
An update issued by Xinte to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Friday revealed the manufacturing facility will, in return for the investment, “prioritise the supply of polysilicon to the investors,” with a poly supply deal due to be drawn up by July 18.
Under the planned investment, Jinko and JA Solar will have the right to demand Xinte repurchase their 9% stakes if the manufacturing plant produces less than 50,000 tons of polysilicon per year in successive years. Xinte said such a development would cost it no more than RMB857 million (AU$176 million).
Xinte said details of when and where the shareholder vote on the proposed tie-up will take place will be published by August 6.
