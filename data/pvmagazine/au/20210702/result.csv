The final report on the proposed reforms was due to be published later this month but the AEMC announced on Thursday it had extended the date until August 12, having received a large number of “diverse views” which it wants to consider in detail.
“Stakeholders have presented us with valuable and differing options – exploring these fully deserves some more time,” AEMC chair Anna Collyer said.
“Extending the publication date for a further month will help us work through the key considerations.”
The draft rule determination – Access, pricing and incentive arrangements for distributed energy resources – was handed down by the AEMC in March and focuses on the integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) into the grid.
The reforms put forward by the AEMC include a raft of proposed rule changes but the proposal for a two-way pricing mechanism has garnered the most attention.
The proposed rule change would give network service providers the option to reward owners of DER for exporting power to the grid when extra energy is needed, and charging them a fee for exporting at times when the system is already well served.
The idea, designed to accommodate the shift from one-way power delivery to rooftops delivering large-scale exports to the grid during the day, was immediately met with outcry from community and industry groups, with critics labelling it a ‘solar tax’.
The AEMC however insists the proposal does not mandate default charges for exporting power and that if network companies do opt for export charging, they would need to consult extensively with customers and have transition plans approved by the Australian Energy Regulator.
The AEMC said its intent is to design rules that will to accommodate the predicted growth of rooftop solar and allow for the effective integration of new technology like home batteries and electric vehicles.
“We are committed to designing a long-term solution that works for all energy consumers,” Collyer said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/02/powerlink-eyes-bespoke-solution-to-system-strength-issues/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 2, 2021",Powerlink eyes bespoke solution to system strength issues,"The state-owned Powerlink announced the approach after a study addressing system strength issues associated with the connection of large-scale renewable generators to the National Electricity Market (NEM) highlighted tailored solutions would be key to maintaining grid stability.
Powerlink chief executive Paul Simshauser said the study, partly funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), delved into the complexity of managing system strength issues arising from renewable energy projects connecting to the grid and analysed options to address the resulting challenges.
“System strength is a complex issue, with the study highlighting there is no one best form of system strength remediation that can be applied to all renewable projects,” Simshauser said in a statement.
“The reports demonstrate the merits of each different approach, but really confirmed that solutions have to be tailored for renewable proponents by thoroughly reviewing the particular circumstances of the network connection.
“It’s been an incredibly valuable process for Powerlink, and one that has really shaped Powerlink’s, and our renewable customers’ understanding of system strength, and how to best manage the challenges.
“The study will also assist in supporting the energy industry more broadly as more renewable projects come online.”
System strength has emerged as a prominent challenge impacting renewable generation projects and the NEM.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has previously declared a system strength gap in parts of the North Queensland grid after the issue prevented several renewable energy generators to export their full capacity.
AEMO has also declared system strength shortfalls in South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales, where five solar farms have had their output curtailed by 50% for more than seven months.
The Powerlink Cost-Effective System Strength Study, supported by solar farm operator Sun Metals, renewables developer Pacific Hydro and engineering and construction firm GHD, examined three reports in a bid to identify solutions to the system strength issue.
The study explored several existing options including the installation of synchronous condensers, changing inverter settings, and strengthening transmission infrastructure.
Simshauser said the study highlighted that a centralised synchronous condenser solution could provide significant network and financial benefit when compared to renewable proponents having to provide their own.
The study also confirmed the key role battery storage could play.
“The final report demonstrated the role grid-forming batteries can play in enabling renewables and supporting the safe and stable operation of the power system,” Simshauser said.
“We’ve found grid-forming batteries can supply system strength, as well as other key services which support the network and assist renewable connections to effectively operate.
“Powerlink will now apply these learnings to reduce the time, cost and risk of renewable connections to the grid, benefiting both Powerlink and customers in the long-term.”
Queensland is yet to welcome a big batteries to its grid but the first, the 100 MW/150 MWh Wandoan South BESS project being developed by Singapore-based Vena Energy, is nearing completion with connection to the transmission network now in the final stages.
It is among a raft of battery storage projects being progressed across the state.
The state-owned energy company Stanwell is developing a 150 MW/300 MWh battery adjacent to the 1.4 GW Tarong Power Station site near Nanango in the South Burnett while the state government has announced plans to install five large-scale, network-connected batteries, with a combined capacity of 40 MWh in regions across the state as part of a community battery trial.
Simshauser said the roll out would assist Powerlink to further explore the merits of battery storage.
“With the recent influx of battery interest by generators and developers in Queensland, we now have a number of opportunities to pilot grid forming batteries and validate our report findings through field studies,” he said.
“Our key goal is delivering a safe, reliable and secure transmission network for Queensland and facilitating the transition to a low carbon future.  This study has been another step in the right direction to achieve this.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/02/looking-back-at-a-q2-2021-period-thats-been-anything-but-boring/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,QUEENSLAND,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,TASMANIA,VICTORIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",,"JULY 2, 2021",Looking back at a Q2 2021 period that’s been anything but boring,"From Paul McArdle, CEO & founder of WattClarity
I’ve promised a few people that I would publish my review of Q2 prices (as I have in previous years) in order to sum up the pricing activity for a quarter that has been ‘anything but boring.’
Longer-term readers might recall that I chose Q2 deliberately, in order to look more at underlying patterns of outcomes (hence have some insight into fundamentals) – less affected by seasonal variables like summer heat prevalent in Q1 and the occasional winter chills of Q3. This line of questioning has been continuing for a number of years, as noted below:
Back (what seems a lifetime ago) on 4th July 2016 I posted this review of spot prices for energy in Q2 2016 where I’d noted about some changes to the underlying patterns that had persisted (pretty stubbornly) for at least a decade beforehand.
At the time I labelled the change in pattern ‘truly remarkable’.
We picked up the same theme in July 2017 to review Q2 prices for 2017 and concluded that “price outcomes for Q2 2017 were off the chart”.
These thoughts were picked up in various news media organisations, including in the AFR:
A year on from all the news media attention, we saw that prices had backed off somewhat from the extreme outcomes of Q2 2017 – though we cautioned that ‘we’re far from out of the woods, yet’!
In that analysis for Q2 2018 we extended what we’d done:
Enhancement 1 = I added in prices for the electricity market in south-western WA (i.e. the ‘WEM’);
Enhancement 2 = I used the access we have to end-of-day clearing futures prices for QLD, NSW, VIC and SA to see what the expectations had been for Q2 prices in 2018;
Enhancement 3 = we looked at the rising incidence of negative prices (in part because of the ‘wind correlation penalty’ particularly in South Australia and the ‘solar correlation penalty’ particularly in QLD).
I did not have time to complete the analysis started on FCAS prices.
I took a break from this line of analysis in 2019 with so much else on, including being swamped by what followed on from the release of our inaugural Generator Report Card 2018 , which proved exceptionally popular.
For a variety of reasons, including the presentation to a Vestas audience about ‘NEM merchant pricing – is this the new normal?’, I picked up this line of questioning again for Q2 2020 here.
Top of mind in review of Q2 2020 was that the quarter:
1)   occurred in the aftermath of a massive summer 2019-20 period with extremes in temperature and demand, and the repetitive incursions of bushfires; and
2)  was been beset by the flow-on impacts of COVID-19.
Through Q2 2021 we were busily occupied with the development of new versions of our dashboard-style software to take account of Five Minute Settlement that begins at the end of Q3 2021:
1)  there’s NEMwatch v10 (the entry-level dashboard); and
2)  ez2view (higher-end dashboard),
3)  But there’s also the deSide® displays (specifically configured for energy users participating in demand response via spot exposure).
… so there’s been plenty of distractions this quarter with both the Callide C4 Catastrophe (from 25th May 2021) and the Yallourn flooding (from 11th June 2021) ratcheting up further what had already been escalated spot pricing compared to Q1.  It certainly was not a boring quarter!
Amongst this all we’ve also been pressing forward with GenInsights21, looking forward to a Q3 release.
More on that later – but, for now, let’s share this overview of pricing patterns for Q2 2021.  This will be our last review published for Q2 with thirty minute pricing in the NEM!
Looking ahead a year (to Q2 2022) we’ll be able to change our analysis of how Q2 to see how the move to Five Minute Settlement has impacted on price outcomes in the physical and financial markets!
Given the keen interest in what’s been happening through Q2 2021 amongst our readers, it was with considerable interest that I’ve powered up NEMreview v7 to have a look at just how different Q2 2021 has ended up being, compared to Q2 2020…
Like in prior years, for this year we’ve only had time to look at the pattern of prices for ENERGY – FCAS will have to wait for Q2 2022 (though there will certainly be a focus on FCAS in Generator Insights 2021!
Starting at the top of the NEM and working our way around, we see that time-weighted average prices jumped significantly (compared to Q2 2020):
It’s clear to see that (in terms of Q2 outcomes) price outcomes for QLD in Q2 were the highest they have ever been since the start of the NEM:

Clearly it is understandable that the Callide C4 Catastrophe (from 25th May 2021) played a significant role … as we will see below.
1)  Highest trading price in the quarter ($15,000/MWh) was up at the Market Price Cap.
There were three half hours (17:00, 17:30, 18:00) on 25th May 2021 that ended up being up at that level.
2)  The lowest trading price in the period was down at –$179.81/MWh (11:30 on 21st April 2021 … a few hours before this spike).
Moving south of the border we see a similar pattern in NSW:

In this case we see that the time-weighted average price ($111.18/MWh) was exceeded only in one other year in the 23 year time range shown – that of Q2 2007 (the year that the ‘Millennium drought’ impacted the NEM):
1)  The highest trading price seen in the quarter was $8,022.05/MWh (at 18:00 on 10th June 2021);
2)  The lowest trading price seen in the quarter was just below zero, at –$85.28/MWh (at 17:30 on 11th June 2021, a day after the highest price … and also following this spike for the 17:00 dispatch interval).
Further south into Victoria we see average prices were up again, but not to the same extent as in QLD and NSW …

Simple time-weighted average price at $70.11/MWh was the 5th highest in the 23-year historical range – helped along later in the quarter by the impact of Yallourn flooding event:
1)  The highest trading price seen in the quarter was $7,443.23/MWh (18:30 on 18th May 2021 – no article on that day); whilst
2)  The lowest trading price seen in the quarter for VIC was –$299.76/MWh (17:30 on 2nd June 2021 – following the 17:05 spike in NSW and QLD in a quirk of the 5/30 issue).
Taking a turn west into South Australia, we see the same underlying pattern, layered with South Australia’s own uniqueness …

The simple time-weighted average for the quarter in SA was (at $69.87/MWh) was beaten in 6 other years:
1)  The highest trading price seen in the quarter was $7,038.75/MWh (at 18:30 NEM time on 18th May 2021 – same as for the VIC region above);
2)  The lowest trading price seen in the quarter was down at  –$183.33/MWh (at 11:00 NEM time on 7th June 2021).
Upping anchor and sailing down to Tassie over Bass Strait, we see that Tasmania continues to sing its own tune at times …

Though up on Q2 2020, the simple time-weighted average for the quarter in TAS for Q2 2021 (at $45.11/MWh) was well below prior ‘bad’ years in the Apple Isle:
1)   The highest trading price seen in the quarter was $2,386.31/MWh (at 17:30 on 21st June 2021 – prior to this NEM-wide spike captured for the 17:40 dispatch interval);
2)  The lowest trading price seen in the quarter was below zero, at –$69.49/MWh: (at 07:00 on 19th April 2021)
I noted in the report for Q2 2018 that we had commenced the process for the addition of data into NEMreview v7 for the spot market of the South-Western Interconnected System (SWIS) in WA.
It’s not been our focus to fill out the data sets available for that market, yet.   Let us know if you would like to speak with us about what we could do with respect to the SWIS?
However we can show you how pricing patterns have progressed over the two subsequent Q2 periods:

In this case we see that Q2 average prices have been fairly consistent with other recent years (at $50.62 for Q2 2021) – which is understandable given that capacity payments should be covering any scarcity premium that would exist in an ‘energy only’ market like the NEM:
1)  The highest price for the quarter was (understandably) low, at only $182.77/MWh (at 19:00 NEM time on 22nd April 2021); but
2)  The lowest price in WA was similar to the NEM regions, at –$73.83/MWh (at 14:00 NEM time on 3rd June 2021).
So here’s the summary trend:

We see prices are up in all regions (and in WA) compared with Q2 2020 – but especially so in QLD and NSW.
There will certainly have been some winners and losers created by the volatility … particularly as it was unexpected in the ‘market consensus’ as shown below.
We’ve noted before on WattClarity® ‘the NEM is a complex place’ – and as Allan stated in January 2020, ‘the NEM is a market where the details matter’.
Whilst time-weighted averages are easily calculated, and readily digestible, for an increasing number of stakeholders they are less and less relevant (including most Semi-Scheduled generation operators).   It’s for this reason that we started taking a closer look at the distribution of prices back in 2016 – and in 2020 we noted that ‘a new paradigm’ appeared to be emerging.
One of the fundamental reasons for this new paradigm was discussed in the Generator Report Card 2018 – in which we wrote how ‘the level of Risk in the NEM is increasing’:

This was done as Theme 2 within Part 2 of the 180-page Analytical Component.
One of the illustrations of this increased risk came where we highlighted that there is less and less volume of capacity offered in the ‘green’ range of prices (above $0/MWh but below $300/MWh):

This is a NEM-wide phenomenon … and it means that the contingency size required to have the price shooting from very low to very high is reducing in size.  Or, in other words, the NEM is becoming more volatile.
What we saw happen in Q2 2021 makes sense, understanding this, because we saw pricing outcomes ‘up at both ends’… in other words:
1)  More high prices; but also
2)  More low prices as well
3)  … which means fewer prices inside the ‘normal’ range.
Makes it more important to ensure you hit the high prices and avoid the low prices if you are a spot-exposed generator (or the inverse, if you are a spot-exposed energy user).  Makes for accelerating divergence of LWA Prices, as discussed in other articles on WattClarity.
We’re looking forward to publishing updates to these trended, aggregated bid stack views to incorporate the most recent 30 months of history in GenInsights21 …
Again, we’re starting at the top of the NEM to work our way around:

In the strange inverse world that was 2016-2019 we can clearly see uplift in ‘everyday high prices’ that (combining also with a spike in prices above $100/MWh) delivered the much higher average prices for the Q2 periods over those 4 years.  We see that 2020 saw a different paradigm start to emerge, with an increase in the number of negative prices.
In 2021, in contrast, we see a combination of two factors:
(i)  Too Low for Zero
As noted on 17th February 2021 (i.e. part-way through Q1 2021), there is an accelerating rise of Negative Prices in the NEM.  This is causing all sorts of challenges in commercial operations … and leading to some changes to NEM Rules as well.
We can clearly see in the chart above (top-right corner) that this trend has continued … summed up also below.
(ii)  High Price incidence
The incidence of prices above $100/MWh is somewhat lower than some earlier crazy years.
However the incidence of prices above $1,000/MWh was the highest it has ever been!
… i.e. truly ‘up at both ends’!
Moving into NSW, we see a similar story unfolding:

Reviewing the two extremes in this chart:
(i)  Sub-Zero
It’s a noticeably flatter curve at the lower-priced end compared to QLD for Q2 2021 (i.e. fewer low and negatively prices trading periods).  This makes sense, given that NSW is strongly interconnected on both sides so somewhat immunised from this latest malaise.
We wonder how this will start changing as the Liddell units begin to retire in the not-too-distant future?
(ii)  Higher-end Prices
For Q2 2020 we saw 809 half-hours with trading prices in NSW above $100/MWh:
1) Which is almost 10x the number of half-hours above that mark in 2020 (i.e. 99 half-hours);
2)  Though it is still below the massive 1,474 half-hours experienced above that level in Q2 2017 (the largest of the three years with higher incidence than Q2 2021).
… but watch for the discussion below of incidence of trading prices > $1,000/MWh (i.e. a ‘high-high’ level).
Further south into Victoria the ‘up at both ends’ picture is similar:

The same pattern can be clearly seen, with 2007 (drought) and 2016-2019 being clear outliers, with distribution curves shunted to the left (i.e. higher price end).  As is the case for QLD and NSW we see that there’s a distinct tail at either end of the curve for VIC in Q2 2020 (104 half-hours above $100/MWh and 170 half-hours below $0/MWh).
Adding in Q2 2021 we see that it neatly overlays the distribution for Q2 2016 … with the exception that there are many more instances of low and negative prices.  One might think that this would mean the time-weighted average for Q2 2021 would be lower than Q2 2016 as a result … but that is not the case, for reasons discussed below.
In South Australia we see a similar sort of picture emerging:

Again, the distribution is generally similar to the ‘remarkable’ Q2 2016 … except:
1)  Like VIC, there are many more instances of low and negative prices for Q2 2021 (almost 3x as many);
2)  Unlike VIC, there are fewer instances of prices >$100/MWh compared to Q2 2016.
3)  This does mean (unlike VIC) that the time-weighted average price for SA in Q2 2021 was below that for Q2 2016.
Down in the apple isle there is the same type of underlying pattern, but with its own Tassie style …

As was the case for Q2 2020, TAS saw the second highest incidence of negative price (290 half-hours, second to SA at 355 half-hours) in the quarter of all NEM regions (WA actually managed second on a Australia-wide basis).
It was also the lowest incidence of of prices above $100/MWh in the NEM (388 half-hours), but again was pipped by WA on an Australia-wide basis (lower, at 339 half-hours).
Over in the west, we still have not yet compiled a longer-range history for the WEM in the SWIS.  What we have is shown here:

Intriguingly (given their Capacity Market) the market there showed the highest incidence of prices above $100/MWh (i.e. 339 half-hours) in the 5 years for which we have compiled history to date – though (as noted above) this incidence was lower than any NEM region.
It also had a decent number of negatively prices periods (308 half-hours, which was approximately 10x the incidence in NSW, and higher than the other NEM regions).
Let us know if WA is of particular interest to you?
I’ve noted above how the pattern of Q2 2021 was generally ‘up at both ends’ (i.e. increased incidence of high price – and increased incidence of low price … which means a hollowing out of the middle (one artefact of the increased risk we’re facing in the NEM)).
Let’s have a look at the high and low extremes…
Looking at the number of times the trading price period exceeded $100/MWh, we see a particular pattern:

As it did last year, the first thing that jumps out in review of these trends is that the levels in Q2 2020 have reduced markedly from the sky-high levels seen in the preceding four years (2016-2019), and are also lower than in the drought year (2007).
However for Q2 2021 we see that the incidence has increased for all regions from the Q2 2020 low point – but particularly for QLD, NSW, VIC and SA.
However it’s when we set a higher benchmark (trading prices exceeds $1,000/MWh) that we see something much more pronounced:

We see here that:
1)  For the QLD region, the incidence (highest in the NEM, at 102 half-hours … or more than 2 days solid, in total!) is more than 3x higher than the next highest years – which were the drought period of Q2 2007, the Q2 2002 year, and the ‘not yet AC interconnected’ period of Q2 2000.  There will surely be some winners and some losers in that!
2)  For the NSW region, the incidence is almost 2x as high as the previous high points – again the drought affected Q2 2007 and Q2 2002.
3)  For VIC, SA and TAS, the incidence was up a little on Q2 2020 but not to the point of historical maximums.
4)  As we would expect there are no price spikes above $1000/MWh in Western Australia (its capacity market means a lower Market Price Cap is possible).
Looking at the number of times the trading price period dropped to, or below, $0/MWh, we see a pattern that’s common to all regions:

It truly is looking like ‘up, up and away!’ with the incidence of negative prices in all regions (and WA as well) … except for NSW.
1)  For those 5 affected regions, we’ve accelerated past 5% of all trading periods and the pattern of plant development would suggest that this trend is not going to change soon.
2)  These increased instances of negative prices are one reason that average revenue ($ per MW installed) are suffering for Wind and Solar Farms outside of NSW – as Marcelle noted on 17th March 2021 for Solar Farms … and for Wind Farms on 18th May 2021.
Time permitting, we would look forward to extending this analysis further, and (for instance) trending over a number of years via GenInsights21.
3)  It would seem to be only a matter of time for the pace of cannibalistic renewables development in NSW to catch up (relative to the higher demand level) and force the same outcome there as well).
As noted above, there will be some winners and some losers in the jump in spot prices seen in the time-weighted averages for Q2 2021 above in all regions.
However these winners (and the losers) may not be who you would initially expect to be lining up on either side of that finish line – and this will be, at least in part, because of the varying expectations that they might have had in advance of this quarter.  Performing a function that’s similar to the ‘Forecast Convergence’ function in the ez2view software, I’ve extracted some data for 4 regions from NEMreview v7 and give you a view of ‘Futures Convergence’ to illustrate the point:
Again from the top of the NEM, we’ll start with Queensland and work our way around:

As highlighted in this progression, the bulk of the market was clearly surprised by where the huge increase in where time-weighted average price for Q2 2020 actually landed.  This suggests that there are a number of stakeholders who ended up considerably out of the money.
1)  Remember that there are a number of causes in this escalation:
(a)  The Callide C4 Catastrophe was clearly a significant cause … just look at the steep jump that followed 25th May 2021;
(b)  However also note that prices had already been climbing through the quarter because of other challenges that pre-dated Callide … such as the lower black coal unit availability discussed on 16th June.
2)  In the example given, if you were an energy user who’d purchased cover for Q2 2021 back in April 2020, you would be thanking your lucky stars that you had hedged at that point (or really any time up until the end of Q1 2021) instead of buying on spot.  Of course, this simplistic comparison does not account for all factors (like risk), but it is illustrative.
Moving into NSW, we also see a steep (and unexpected) escalation during the quarter:

I don’t have time to explore currently (perhaps a knowledgeable reader can explain why) but I note that the expected price dropped further during Q1 2021 … before escalating sharply when issues (such as these) became apparent.  We’ll also see the same for VIC and SA below as well?!
Further south into Victoria the chart is very similar:

We noted above that the time-weighted average price for Q2 2021 was lower in VIC than NSW and QLD (which means the BASE hedge settled lower as well).  However there is still:
1)  The dip in Q1 2021;
2)  Followed by the escalation through Q2 2021.
3)  Interestingly as well, I’ve noted on the image that the futures price hit a temporary peak on 20th May (at $69/MWh buoyed high daily averages on Monday 17th May (TWA $248.37/MWh) and Tuesday 18th May (TWA $411.28/MWh)) … but then subsided somewhat, only to be accelerated again by the Yallourn flooding.
In South Australia we see the following:

Again we see that:
1)  Where the time-weighted price cleared for Q2 2021 was significantly above where it was expected to be at Q1 2020.
2)  That expectation softened up until the end of Q1 2021 … and particularly inside of that quarter.
3)  But then escalated from the start of Q2 2021.
This again begs the question … what was it that ‘the market consensus’ missed so significantly in
The ASX does not offer hedge contracts for the Tasmanian region, so we do not have visibility of the markets prior expectations for the quarter just passed.
The ASX does not offer hedge contracts for the SWIS, so we do not have visibility of the markets prior expectations for the quarter just passed.
 
It’s not all that often that we see quarters in which the market has been so completely wrong, in terms of how where prices ended up being, compared to expectations.
(a)  This was the case even (or, more accurately, especially – for NSW, VIC and SA (given the softening of expectations through Q1)) right up to the start of the quarter!
(b)  This will be worth drilling into this at a later point in time…
In prior years I have endeavoured to complete analysis of FCAS pricing … but not quite found the time.
Given everything else we have going on in 2021 I knew right at the start this would not be possible – though we have started to pull together some interesting analysis of the FCAS services for GenInsights21 that we’ll look forward to sharing in that report.

As the transition to renewable energy continues, network operators are being required to find new ways to maintain the stability of the network and maximise the value of individual consumer-owned assets like rooftop solar and home batteries.
Luceo Energy CEO Patrick Matweew said the move from a centralised, fossil-fuel electricity system to a smart decentralised, renewable energy ecosystem had redefined the role of energy distribution networks.
Matweew however said network operators currently have very little real-time data available in the low-voltage segment of their networks and that visibility is critical to ensure safe and secure operation of distribution networks which are being inundated with very high penetrations of DER.
“The new world of energy networks requires flexibility and more dynamic solutions to manage intermittent sources like renewables,” he said.
“Distributed and diverse renewable energy resources require different network capabilities. Safety and cost-effective management of the consequences of an increasing penetration of rooftop PV systems in Australia is at the forefront of most network executives’ minds.
“These PV systems, as well as other renewable energy sources, are often very variable in their generation and managing that has emerged as one of the key challenges that must be addressed.
“To overcome the variability challenge in a secure, reliable and affordable way, network operators need access to real-time data and advanced analytics to react quickly and effectively.
“To successfully transition to this new dynamic operational model, it requires data from every feeder in the network to enable data driven decision-making to predict and manage changing network conditions.”

Matweew said the cloud-based Luceo Platform gives operators real-time visibility and critical insights from data it collects across the energy network to proactively control distributed loads and manage fleets of distributed renewable resources, such as rooftop solar.
“The platform and the applications that run on the platform have been developed to address one of the largest obstacles in the transition of the energy systems to a decentralised, renewable future – the lack of data and visibility on what is going on in the electricity networks,” he told pv magazine.
“With the Luceo Energy platform, the network operators can now see in real time what is happening within their network. Sounds simple but there are quite a lot of things to be looking into when thinking about the operation of the electricity network.
“The Luceo platform provides solutions for safety, operating parameters as well as important high-level insights.”

The platform’s modular design lets network operators choose the features suitable for their specific situation. This ranges from analytics for network data assets, machine learning to predict future constraints, dynamic control of loads and DER, alerts and notifications, and a customisable dashboard that puts all information and insight into a single place.
“The Luceo Energy data platform is architected and built to manage high volumes of incoming energy data streams and process these data streams to provide the needed visibility to the network operators,” Matweew said.
“The incoming data is analysed and the result of such analysis is then displayed in a specific user interface.
“Once you have this kind of visibility, you can see how your network breathes and act on demand response and dynamic load control, such as giving commands to solar inverters, pool pumps or hot water tanks to turn on or off, to manage distributed loads.”
Luceo Energy, a part of Brisbane-based start-up Redback Technologies, said the network-scale platform is hosted in Microsoft Azure and resides in Australian data centres, addressing data sovereignty requirements for customers.
Government-owned utility Energy Queensland is among those bodies to show an interest in the platform, introducing it to its network as part of a large-scale pilot program.
“We have been working with Energy Queensland very closely since 2018, resulting in the roll out of 20,000 Luceo Energy network devices across the state in combination with the Luceo Energy platform,” Matweew said.
“There are about 2.4 million connection points in Queensland and 20,000 are now equipped with a Luceo Energy network device, reporting data in one-minute intervals.”

Luceo Energy’s software has also attracted the attention of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) which has provided $2.6 million funding as part of a $5.7 million project which will see the company develop a proof-of-concept platform.
Luceo Energy will integrate data from network infrastructure, smart meters and smart consumer-owned energy assets such as batteries and inverters to help distribution network service providers (DNSPs) overcome challenges associated with managing DER within low-voltage networks.
“The ARENA project utilises the same Luceo Energy platform but provides funding to develop, test and release new functionality for the platform and for integration with third party solutions,” Matweew said.
“This new functionality, that is supported through the ARENA Shield project, is very specifically aimed at DER hosting capacity and the question how networks can allow more DER on their networks without additional investment or risks to the operations.”
In announcing the funding earlier this year, ARENA CEO Darren Miller said there is a growing industry consensus that a lack of reliable, low-voltage network data is limiting DER’s true value for both customers and networks.
“It is incredibly difficult to acquire, sort and integrate multiple data sets into a single source. Tackling this complex and challenging task is what makes Luceo Energy’s project so innovative,” he said.
“The project could increase the value delivered by renewables by determining a sweet spot between investment in data monitoring and visibility of DER to ensure that the right level of investment is applied, ultimately benefiting all key stakeholders from DNSPs, regulators and ultimately the customer.”

China’s National Energy Administration (NEA) has attempted to move the dial on small scale PV in the nation by asking its provincial offices to nominate counties where a trial program to push blanket rooftop solar can be carried out.
The state entity wants selected counties to have at least 20% of all residential rooftops equipped with solar, as well as at least 30% of commercial and industrial structures; 40% of non-government public buildings, such as hospital and schools; and half of the roofs on the government estate.
NEA provincial offices will be pressed for time, however, with the national office requiring the pilot counties to be identified within a fortnight.
Under the plan, installers will be selected to develop all of the rooftop capacity in each county and, two days after the policy was promulgated, the State Power Investment Corporation informed its subsidiaries it would be involved in the distributed PV pilot schemes.
With the provinces of Fujian, Guangzhou, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Gansu, and Zhejiang having, since March, published plans for similar programs, the NEA decision appears to have rolled out their actions across the rest of the nation.
Trade body the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA) says the key feature of the new policy refers back to a document released in 2018, which attempted to enable the private sale of rooftop electricity to third-party consumers, referred to as ‘neighbour trading.’
With no net-metering in China, the earlier document attempted to regulate for solar households to be able to sign sale agreements with nearby energy consumers in return for paying just a grid-use fee to their utility. The power generated would be injected into the grid and the amount signed for by the customer would be paid for, to the generator, at a rate cheaper than grid electricity.
That earlier attempt at neighbour trading made little progress, thanks to unwillingness by electric companies, and ensured there is little incentive to invest in rooftop PV in China unless it is entirely for self-consumption. The CPIA said the new NEA policy regulates the trade in rooftop electricity under the terms originally suggested three years ago, in a move which could unleash a wave of distributed solar in the world’s biggest PV market.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/02/from-toothbrushes-to-saving-the-planet-how-ultrasonic-delamination-could-hold-the-key-to-battery-recycling/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM",MARIAN WILLUHN,"JULY 2, 2021",From toothbrushes to saving the planet: How ultrasonic delamination could hold the key to battery recycling,"From pv magazine Global
Ultrasonic toothbrushes could be the key to a novel, highly efficient battery recycling method.
New research from the U.K.’s Faraday Institution has suggested ultrasonic delamination could offer a fast, sustainable approach. Not only is the technique apparently quicker and more eco-friendly than hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical processes, but researchers say it could also yield higher-purity materials.
The key to unlocking battery recycling lies in reclaiming active materials from the cathodes, which contain the bulk of a device’s precious metals. For instance, it is the cathodes which contain the nickel, manganese and cobalt which give NMC batteries their initialism.
Those components are glued in a porous layered film 200 μm thick onto copper and aluminium foils – the current collectors – using a special binder. Commonly used binders include polyvinylidene difluoride, mixed carboxymethyl cellulose, and styrene-butadiene rubber.
Recyclers typically shred batteries and treat them with fire or aqueous solvents to recover such precious metals, with attendant energy consumption and toxic waste drawbacks.
Researchers from the universities of Birmingham and Leicester, working under Faraday Institution battery recycling research project ‘ReLiB’, however, have suggested a new mode of recycling. They published their findings in the paper Lithium-ion battery recycling using high-intensity ultrasonication, in Green Chemistry.
The team used a commercial ultrasonic system with a 20mm sonotrode, operating at 20 kHz with a power of up to 2,200 W. At that frequency and power, vapour-filled cavitation bubbles formed randomly, oscillating heavily and expanding before collapsing again. Bursting at the surface of the active components, the cavitation bubbles’ blasts were stronger than the polymeric binder, resulting in complete delamination of the current collector.
“This novel technique works in the same way as a dentist’s ultrasonic descaler, breaking the adhesive bonds between the coating layer and the substrate,” said Andrew Abbott, from the University of Leicester, who led the research. “It is likely that the initial use of the technology will use production scrap from battery manufacturing facilities as the feedstock and feed recycled material straight back into the battery production line, possibly at the same site. This could be a real step-change in battery recycling.”
For the new process, the electrode is submerged in a solution of de-ionized water and moved past the, similarly immersed, sonotrode at a distance of less than 3mm. It takes around ten seconds to clean an electrode sheet using the method, the academics found, translating into an improvement of the amount of material that can be processed in a given time by a factor of around 100.
Keep volume low or muted when watching
The researchers retrieved 99.5% of the active materials of the anode and cathode in the experiment, with the remainder comprising particles of less than 3 μm – too small for filtration recovery. The researchers assumed those particles were carbon black additives. By comparison, current hydrometallurgical processes using sulfuric acid solutions achieve a recovery efficiency of around 67% of active materials.
The academics said the efficacy of ultrasonic delamination is dependent on the binder used but modifying the pH of the solution, and potentially adding wetting agents to the process, could optimise it for any binder.
The team from the English Midlands said ultrasonic recycling would cost $0.10 per 150 gram of recovered electrode material but may require more expensive pre-treatment as the batteries need to be disassembled very carefully and the fully intact electrode sheets fed into the ultrasonic device. However, added the researchers, 5-20% of battery waste comes as production scrap, which needs no disassembly. For that sort of application, ultrasonic recycling is already suitable, according to the Faraday Institution team. The researchers have filed for a patent for their technique. 
The researchers had published a separate paper in Green Chemistry in October, describing how battery manufacturers could apply a ‘design-for-recycling-approach,’ featuring comprehensive labelling, easy-to-open structures, and solid busbars to enable robots to perform dangerous disassembly. The paper also advocated connecting cells in a bulk structure rather than multiple modules. That has already been realised with cell-to-pack and blade battery devices which have been brought to market, albeit primarily with the aim of improving the capacity and power of lithium-iron-phosphate products.
