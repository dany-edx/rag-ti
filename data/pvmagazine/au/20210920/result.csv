The Summit plant is close to the last of SA Water sites to be solar energised as part of the state-owned utility’s $300 million plan to “offset SA Water’s electricity needs, help lower costs and reduce emissions”, as David Speirs, South Australia’s Minister for Environment and Water described it back in May.
Nicola Murphy, Senior Manager of the ground-breaking initiative that has been internally designed and planned by SA Water, welcomes viewers in the video below to a “glimpse” of the future “where the need to provide reliable water services to customers is perfectly balanced with the need to protect the environment”.

The Zero Cost Energy Future project is not only about installing a total of 368,000 solar panels on SA Water sites across the state, but also implements intelligent demand scheduling and energy efficiency measures, and seeks to surf the National Electricity Market (NEM) — buying electricity when prices are lowest, and selling excess solar stored in a fleet of battery devices back to the NEM, to further offset costs.
In the 2019-20 financial year, the utility’s operating energy expenses reached $86 million, and now, with the project to slash costs nearing completion, Murphy says, “We’re excited to finalise the connection of all our 30-plus locations to the national grid ahead of the warmer months” of the Australian spring and summer, when she says “the real benefits of solar power” will come to the fore. 
The huge task of solar powering SA Water has been achieved in less than two years, although the project’s intentions were announced and tenders called for in late 2017/early 2018, when it also soft-pedalled off the mark with a pilot project for 100 kW of floating PV at the state’s Happy Valley reservoir.
In February 2019, Adelaide-headquartered contractor Enerven was awarded a $304 million framework agreement contract to deliver the landmark solar + storage program.
That first floatovoltaic installation suggested there would be nothing cookie cutter about the SA Water solar-powered sites. And indeed, some are wastewater treatment plants by the sea, such as Christies Beach with its 3.5 MW ground-mounted array; others are purely pumping, such as the Geranium Plains pump station, one of four channelling drinking water from the River Murray along 358 kilometres of pipeline to the Upper Spencer Gulf, and which now has 14 GWh per annum of clean energy at its disposal; and then there’s the Adelaide Desalination Plant, which will draw its huge fully operating energy requirement from 35,000 solar panels on east-west trackers, generating 21 GWh of electricity per annum — with much of that energy being sold into the NEM when higher rainfall patterns reduce demand for the processed water. 
Integrated battery energy storage with PV, says Murphy, will consistently “allow us to capture and use solar energy as required, and better manage the volatile and often fluctuating prices of the energy market.
One of the largest renewable energy projects in the Australian water industry,  Zero Cost Energy Future won this year’s Australian Construction Achievement Award, with judges commenting that the project sets a significant precedent for both the construction and water industries, developing standards and a general methodology for delivering projects at this scale.
They said SA Water had provided “the entire water industry with a pathway towards zero-cost energy and materially reducing its carbon footprint, which is a significant societal outcome given it is a carbon intensive industry”.
The project is expected to reduce SA Water’s emissions by around 89,000 tonnes per annum, which is the equivalent of planting seven million trees, or removing more than 32,000 cars powered by internal combustion engines from the road.
On the announcement of the Summit plant energisation, Murphy proudly said, “This initiative was designed by our people and shows South Australians leading the way with the smarts and skills to integrate renewable energy across existing plants, pump stations and other land holdings.”
Summit itself, she said, is now “ready to capture the spring sun rays”, and “the 1,766 kilowatt hours of solar generated by these panels is roughly the equivalent of powering 290 South Aussie houses each year”.

This weekend, the daily updated cumulative annual average of electricity delivered by the more than 1.2 MW solar array and the 3.712 MWh Tesla Powerpack was shown to be 74.35%.

For the past six months, the microgrid, which is integrated with the existing diesel-generation capacity and managed by a Tesla Microgrid Controller, has been supplying the island community of some 350 permanent residents, and its dormant-during-Covid-19 tourist facilities, which typically host 16,000 visitors each year.
Its successful operation was celebrated by Photon Energy Group headquarters in Amsterdam in an announcement on Friday.
“The experience we have gained through the delivery of the project demonstrates that solar power and energy storage not only reduce emissions and other environmental risks but are instrumental in ensuring energy security,” said Michael Gartner, Managing Director of Photon Energy Australia, and Co-founder of Photon Energy Group.
In August, the Dutch developer had cited grid-connection delays at two solar farms near Leeton, in New South Wales as part of the reason for a $1.4 million loss in the second quarter of this year, compared to earnings of $1.5 million in Q1.
This island microgrid, although it posed unique challenges, was at least free of the tyranny of National Electricity Market connection travails.
Lord Howe Island’s community, isolated some 700 kilometres north east of Sydney in the Pacific Ocean, has long relied on shipments of diesel every two to three weeks for its energy needs. 
The shipments themselves posed a risk to the island’s coastal environment and its coral reef, which is the world’s southernmost reef formation; and reliance on diesel also exposed the community to fluctuations in global fuel prices and threats to its energy security.
A statement from Photon Energy says that since the system was installed, it has at times provided the island with renewable energy “for stretches of up to five consecutive days and nights in August without any diesel-generated power”, showing the reliability of solar-plus-battery technology, “even during the less sunny winter months”.
Partly funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), which contributed $4.5 million, the $1.1 million project also secured a loan of $5.9 million from the New South Wales Government and provided the balance of funds from its own capital.
The business case for the renewable energy project was first developed in 2014 by the Lord Howe Island Board, the statutory authority that manages the island.
Its plan originally included wind turbines as part of the hybrid mix, but a Lord Howe Island Lessons Learnt Report, published by ARENA in late 2019, said the wind component could not be delivered. Further feasibility studies undertaken since 2017, “identified that a reconfigured and resized solar PV and battery storage generator would provide the same benefits”.
Photon Energy won the tender for engineering, procurement and construction of the project in 2019, and implemented a value-management consultation process between the clients and its design and management teams — a thought-provoking step it has found beneficial in all its projects, which have so far racked up a combined global solar-generation capacity of 110 MWp.
On Lord Howe Island, the process “resulted in substantial cost savings”, and “an increase of 8% to the size of the PV component and 14% to the battery component”, as well as permanent public toilet facilities at the site which is passed by tourists on one of the island’s many stunning scenic walks.
The Lessons Learnt Report concluded that, “Allowing a short period within the project timeframe for a value-management dialogue can result in a project delivering more ‘wins’ for the community and within the scope tolerance of the project.”

Given the island’s reliance on diesel for its electricity, it was also critical that the integration of solar and battery storage be seamless and maintain an uninterrupted supply.
The remote location of the island, often inclement weather conditions and the site of the power plant posed access, design and geotechnical challenges for the contractors. In addition, says the Photon Energy Group website, the project “required a great deal of adaptability and problem-solving due to complications resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic”.
Despite such difficulties, Photon Energy Engineering Australia successfully negotiated the constraints of this environmentally sensitive site and the project, commenced in February 2020, was completed in 14 months.
Mick Pettit, Acting CEO of the Lord Howe Island Board said on Friday, “The announcement of this project is a fantastic result for the Lord Howe Island community and visitors alike.” He added that improving the island’s energy security, along with reducing the environmental impact of its electricity supply, “without detracting from the World Heritage values of Lord Howe Island, is a result that everyone should celebrate”.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/20/let-there-be-sunlight-in-the-public-parks-of-high-density-communities/,"COMMUNITY,HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",NATALIE FILATOFF,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2021",Let there be sunlight … in the public parks of high-density communities! ,"Heliostats, or concentrating solar power (CSP) systems, may have been pushed aside in electricity production due to the competitive cost of photovoltaics, but other applications of the technology are emerging, as is demonstrated by a sunlight-reflecting structure atop a new residential tower in the Sydney suburb of Rhodes.
Like a Luna Park ride or a giant escalator to the sky, the crowning glory of the Rhodes Central apartment and shopping centre development by Billbergia is a standout golden-aluminium-clad steel structure that captures sunlight and reflects it into an overshadowed section of Union Square below.
“When we started working on the Rhodes Central project, we saw pretty quickly that there was an existing overshadowing issue,” and that the new development would block the light to a further section of the park, says Saul Moran, Development Director of Planning and Design for Billbergia.
He tells pv magazine Australia, “We thought we could create not only a great piece of public domain within our own project but also improve the existing town centre through the heliostat technology.”
Globally, this is the second-known use of heliostats positioned on top of buildings to improve the environment experienced by humans below. The first was installed at One Central Park in 2014, to shine sunlight down into the atrium of that multi-award-winning mixed-use building near Sydney’s Central Station, on the former site of Carlton and United Breweries.
Alex Lehman, Research Scientist at Heliosystems has been involved in the design of both projects, and says that although heliostat technology has been deployed since the 1970s — typically in remote, high-radiance areas to collect energy for solar-electric plants — it has recently been adapted for architectural use, and “we are only just beginning to understand what you can do with active and passive lighting in our cities”.
The mind springs instantly to dark, dank city plazas and pedestrian precincts surrounded by buildings, where no-one would willingly linger, and where plants have no chink of opportunity to grow towards; this in a world where the benefits of being outdoors in green areas are well documented, and people long for community spaces as more and more workers are doing their jobs from home due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and councils are encouraging high-density developments around transport hubs to cut the costs of extending services far and wide.
Sunbeams without the burn
The Rhodes Central project was devised and structurally tested by Lehmann in collaboration with SJB Architecture, Inhabit Technical Design and Samaras Engineering.
Its heliostat captures light with a series of roof-mounted smart mirrors that autonomously tilt towards the sun and bounce the light to a second set of reflector mirrors in the 27-metre-high crown structure, which then direct it through UV-filtering plastic sheeting back down town Union Square plaza.

“We were down there the other day, it was about 22 degrees and as the sun came around at about 11am, half the park was in direct sunlight and half the park was in sunlight from the heliostat,” says Moran. He adds, “It’s a beautiful, soft light, it felt quite warm and it was really compelling to see how well it works.”
Some of the creative nuances of lighting public areas with redirected sunlight, says Lehmann, are in designing where the light falls to interesting effect. He tells pv magazine Australia that at One Central Park, the lighting not only helps grow the plants even below street level in the food court area, but the plants then “disperse the light in a lovely way” that’s more subtle and appealing than casting illumination onto a hard surface.
At Rhodes Central, he’s used the heliostat’s beams to highlight certain trees: “I’ve placed some lights to shine through a gum tree that’s quite sparse, for example, which means it creates an interesting shadow on the ground — there are lots of fun things you can do with the way the light arrives down in the park.”
The bespoke Rhodes project was funded by Billbergia via a voluntary planning agreement (VPA) with the local council, but Lehmann envisages future tradeoffs between developers who want to maximise the returns on a property by increasing the heights of buildings, and councils who want to enhance public amenity. The cost of building an effective, automated heliostat, Lehmann says, could be more than met by the real estate value of  additional levels.
Increasing the value and bliss factor of south-facing real estate
Although the overall design of the heliostat will more than likely remain bespoke for larger projects like Rhodes Central, which also incorporates a weather station that signals reflectors to adopt a brace position in response to high winds, or turn towards the rain on wet days for a free wash, the possibility is also to fit much smaller iterations of the technology to illuminate dwellings that get little direct sunlight.
Sun-tracking mirrors could be used, he suggests, to direct sunlight from the inner surface of a balcony into an apartment, or from a neighbouring garage roof towards the south-facing windows of a house.

Before designing the Rhodes project, Heliosystems had been focused on the concentrating solar thermal power industry, which, says Lehmann, is probably no longer viable in its current form.
But, he adds, the future looks bright for applications of CSP to generate heat directly for industrial uses such as metal smelting, solar fuel production for shipping and air transport, or direct hydrogen production without the need to first generate electricity.
“It’s about finding the niches where solar photovoltaics haven’t already solved the problem,” he says, “and the electricity network is a problem thoroughly solved by photovoltaics and wind power.”
Lehmann is currently working on a high-temperature thermal receiver for industrial-process heat applications, while fine-tuning the Rhodes Central heliostat to light up pedestrian lives.

A self-heating coat, a “wifi-programmable dress” and two garments featuring flexible organic PV films which will enable them to charge electrical devices on the go, form part of a wearable solar fashion collection launched by a Silicon Valley start-up.
Harvard and Cambridge University graduate Kitty Yeung, who is also senior program manager for quantum computing at Microsoft, has debuted her e-textile collection with the help of a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign opened in June, with 5% of the proceeds to be donated to non-profit organisations concerned with promoting science, technology, engineering, arts and math; and environmental protection.
The ‘Lotus’ overcoat and ‘Guilin’ dress in the range feature organic PV films manufactured by French ink and chemicals company Armor which can offer up to 5 V of charge for electronic devices.
Yeung’s start-up, Art by Physicist, said yesterday, the e-textile range is available to order from the company website and items can be shipped from next month. The company said each item will be digitally printed on demand and the flexible organic solar films can be removed and disposed of in the same manner as any other electrical devices.
The full e-textile range also includes customisable LED fabric designs and Bluetooth accessories.
“Now that I have all these different kinds of technologies, the next step for my brand will be to go even further in … production-on-demand by enabling customisation,” said Yeung, in a press release issued by Art by Physicist. “In the near future, customers would be able to add the desired technology on the garment of their choice.”

State-owned Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) today announced it has commissioned India’s largest floating solar plant. The 25 MW project, occupying a water surface area of 100 acres, is located at NTPC’s Simhadri thermal power station in Andhra Pradesh.
Besides producing clean power, the project will also reduce water evaporation by shading the water. It will offer a higher energy yield than conventional, ground-mounted solar projects, due to the cooling effect of the water on the panels.
BHEL said it designed an innovative floating array to meet the unique requirement of anchoring the support structures without touching or loading either the reservoir floor or the retaining wall ‘bund.’ The module array was designed—for the first time in India—to withstand gusts of wind of up to 180km/h. Corrosion-resistant platform structures and other equipment were used due to the coastal location of the project.
Bharat’s scope of work in the project included design as well as engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) of the solar array. The project was executed by BHEL’s recently formed Solar Business division.
The installer offers EPC services for solar projects including ground-mounted, rooftop, floating, and canal top installations. The company said it has an Indian solar EPC portfolio of more than 1.2 GW and claims the nation’s largest portfolio of floating solar, with more than 45 MW commissioned and 107 MW or so under execution. BHEL also manufactures space-grade solar panels, and batteries for space applications.
