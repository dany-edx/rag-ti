It’s momentous: having a genuinely two-sided wholesale electricity market in Australia, in which energy users can benefit from being flexible in the times they choose to use or not use electricity in a way that serves the grid when demand is high, and also promotes efficiency in the amount of grid-balancing assets Australia needs to build to complement a burgeoning renewable energy supply.
In an announcement this morning, Enel X declared itself the first registered demand response provider to the new market. As the operator of Australia’s largest virtual power plant (VPP), boasting more than 350 MW of available capacity (available at various times) from commercial and industrial (C&I) energy users, Enel X has already successfully offered C&I-based frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) to AEMO since 2017.
But Jeff Renaud, Head of Enel X Asia and Oceania, said, “Today marks a huge milestone for the wholesale market, and an opportunity for businesses to earn a significant new revenue stream while supporting Australia’s most affordable path to decarbonisation.”
Renaud told pv magazine Australia that businesses and sites such as commercial buildings, supermarkets, water utilities hospitals, agricultural sites, manufacturers and data centres can be paid in the range of around $10,000 to more than a million dollars a year — depending on the energy capacity they can be flexible with — to switch off their electricity loads at times when demand on the grid is greatest. 
“The nice thing, and a critical element of the demand-response mechanism and other forms of two-sided market participation, like frequency control,” says Renaud, “is that businesses can do this outside of their retail power supply contract. They can use any retailer they like, and can then separately participate in the Demand Response Market (DRM) and get paid for doing it.”
Enel X
The Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) first received a rule change request on 31 August 2018  — from the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, the Total Environment Centre and The Australia Institute — to introduce a mechanism for wholesale demand response. 
It was one of three separate rule change requests the AEMC received that year relating to the proposed new mechanism. After industry and public consultation processes, the Commission made a final determination in June 2020 that the wholesale demand response mechanism (WDRM) would come into force on 24 October, 2021, allowing a new category of registered participant, “a demand response service provider (DRSP) to bid demand response directly into the wholesale market as a substitute for generation”, says the AEMC website.
Although the determination officially came into force yesterday, the market actually started trading today.
The Australian Energy Market Operator estimates that by 2040 Australia will need up to 19 GW of new dispatchable resources to balance renewable power and replace retiring coal-fired power stations; the WDRM is designed to stimulate participation by large electricity users, and by investors in energy storage.
Enel X, the innovations spinoff of Italian energy utility Enel, asserts that “Each megawatt of demand response in the WDRM will lessen the need for investment into other more expensive resources.”
Enel X has been talking to C&I energy users since it entered the Australian market in 2011, forming its VPP from their existing assets — boilers, heat pumps, cooling systems, compressors, manufacturing lines and so on.
“We’re using lots of industrial equipment that already exists, for secondary purposes,” says Renaud. Linking such a distributed set of energy resources is not easy, he says, but the Enel X VPP platform has been constantly evolving over the past 10 years, and he’s proud of the sophisticated dual-asset use that it enables — ”It’s inherently very economically efficient.”
From the participant’s point of view, the FCAS market and the demand response market differ in two main ways: reaction time and the duration of downtime required. 
The Enel X VPP automates FCAS such that participating C&I assets can respond in less than one second to a frequency wobble in the grid, and may only remain offline for 10 to 15 minutes (which may suit cold-storage facilities that won’t lose their cool during that time, or data centres that can quickly switch to auxiliary systems, such as battery power, without mishap).
Participating in DRM allows more like a five-minute response time and up to a 15-minute response time. The Enel X VPP platform notifies those who have signed up and waits to get the go-ahead to take a nominated load offline for one to two hours when the grid risks being overloaded by demand and prices are high — typically in the evening hours of summer (the first and fourth quarters of the year).
“A customer that can respond in five minutes can earn more value than the customer that can respond in 10 or 15 minutes, but each can participate,” says Renaud. “We explain the economic spectrum of participation and then work with the customer to explore the options and approach that they’re comfortable with, that works with their IT systems and their operational policies.”
AEMO recently noted that the market for FCAS related demand response has greatly encouraged the growth in available resources bidding into the market; Enel X itself registered some 150 MW of new resources over a period of 12 months, bringing its total participating fleet of customer assets to 250 MW. 
AEMO’s Quarterly Energy Dynamics report for Q1 of 2021 referred to the positive impact this has had on market outcomes, including that it contributed to a reduction in the cost of electricity to consumers.
Enel X says it intends to work with its business customers to replicate its FCAS success in the WDRM.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/25/sea-electric-builds-and-badges-8-5-tonne-capacity-clean-fuel-trucks-in-melbourne/,"EV,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"OCTOBER 25, 2021",SEA Electric builds and badges 8.5-tonne capacity clean-fuel trucks in Melbourne,"SEA Electric, an Australian company specialising in the assembly and 100% electrification of commercial vehicles for a global market, today announced the first of its 8.5 tonne SEA 300-85 trucks to roll off its Melbourne production line.
The truck, with a 138 kWh battery driving a motor with 1,500 Nm torque, has been delivered to Mineral Resources (MRL), a mining services company that provides services to clients throughout Western Australia, and also operates iron ore, lithium and other mines in the Pilbara and Goldfields regions of the state.
MRL will use the SEA 300-85 to transport materials between mine sites, and this particular vehicle will serve as a flagship for the company’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint — that is, it will take pride of place at community events and roadshows.
“We’ve developed a transition plan to a low-carbon future and that includes reducing our reliance on diesel,” Mike Grey, MRL’s Chief Executive of Mining Services, said in a statement.
He added, “Our mission is to grow our mining services and operations responsibly,” and transport offers the company a low-hanging-fruit opportunity for reducing carbon emissions.
SEA Electric
The SEA announcement comes just weeks after the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) invested $5 million in New South Wales Hunter Valley-based battery technology producer 3ME Technology which enables miners to swap out diesel engines with innovative modular battery electric systems.
Direct and indirect (from energy used to power operations) emissions from oil, gas, mining and metals processing industries in Australia contribute more than a quarter of the country’s total greenhouse gas emissions, which has led the CEFC to increase its focus on decarbonising Australia’s resources sector
CEO of the CEFC, Ian Learmonth, said earlier this month that, “The decarbonisation of Australia’s resources sector is critical to our clean energy transition and electrification has an important part to play.”
SEA Electric has been performing driveline swaps on existing internal combustion-engine powered trucks since 2017, and it says the move to become an Original Equipment Manufacturer, constructing vehicles “from new” on its new Melbourne production line will reduce the cost of its trucks, increase efficiencies, reduce waste and accelerate the speed of manufacture.
The SEA300-85 is one in a full range of pure electric truck models — from 4.5-tonne trucks that can be driven with a car licence, to 22.5-tonne three-axle rigid transporters — available through a network of 12 dealerships around Australia.
Founded in Australia, SEA Electric is now headquartered in Los Angeles in the US and supplies customers in the US, New Zealand, Thai, Indonesian and South African markets.
Less than a week ago it announced its largest ever order, for 1,150 SEA Hino M5 EVs, from GATR EV a division of GATR Truck Center which has five dealerships across the US states of Iowa and Minnesota.
GATR has a partnership with Merchants Fleet, a fast-growing US fleet-management company which has committed more than $2 billion towards electrifying 50% of its mobility fleet by 2025, and 50% of its clients’ fleets by 2030.
To meet such demand, GATR Truck Center is developing an e-commerce system that will sell purely electric vehicles and its strategic partnership with SEA Electric, said Jay Klemp, Director of Sales at GATR EV, means “we can build enough of these Hino trucks to provide demonstration vehicles and also solutions to our future fleet partners.”
Nick Casas, SEA Electric Vice President of Sales and Marketing, said last week, “This is our first four-digit order and it comes in a non-incentive state, which proves that commercial EV solutions can expand in areas with no incentives”.
SEA Electric is in the process of replicating the production techniques it has developed in Australia for other global markets.
“Australian manufacturing and ingenuity is alive and well, said Bill Gillespie, President of SEA Electric in the Asia Pacific region.
”The response from the transport industry since the launch of our local volume production is heartening,” he added, saying the company hoped to pass many more milestones on the road to its stated mission, which is to eliminate more than a billion kilograms of CO2 emissions over the coming five years.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/25/philippines-ac-energy-finds-another-way-to-grow-its-renewable-energy-holdings-in-oz/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"OCTOBER 25, 2021",Philippines’ AC Energy finds another way to grow its renewable energy holdings in Oz,"AC Energy Corporation (ACEN), a subsidiary of the Filipino conglomerate Ayala Corporation, has achieved board approval to increase its ownership in the joint venture UPC\AC Renewables Australia to 100%, and with it fully acquire a large pipeline of Australian renewable energy projects that includes Australia’s largest solar farm to date.
The acquisition for a quoted US$243.3 million (around AU$326 million), is subject to regulatory approvals, including the non-objection of the Foreign Investment Review Board of Australia, but if successful will mark “a strategic pivot for ACEN, as the company embarks on its first wholly owned development and operations platform outside of the Philippines”, said ACEN President and CEO Eric Francia in a statement last week.
He added, “We are excited to scale up investment in our Australia platform, as we expect the country to accelerate its energy transition.”
The announced UPC\AC Renewables pipeline in Australia so far includes the above mentioned 720 MW New England Solar Farm near Uralla in New South Wales, the first 400 MW of which is expected to start commissioning next year.
Also in the portfolio are the 400 MW Stubbo Solar Farm and associated 200 MW/200 MWh battery energy storage project, which achieved New South Wales Department of Planning and Environment approval in July this year and are expected to commence construction in 2022 ; a share in the Rise Renewables 250 MW Baroota Pumped Hydro Project in South Australia, which is seeking support from Traditional Owners, the Nukunu Wapma Thura Corporation, before progressing to a final investment decision; the proposed 600 MW Birriwa solar farm and battery project near Dunedoo in New South Wales, which is currently at the scoping stage; and 160 MW Axedale Solar Farm in Central Victoria, which may also come to include a battery energy storage system (BESS).
Patrice Clausse, Chief Operating Officer of AC Energy International, said ACEN  will fully integrate the Australian operations into ACEN, including the platform’s “highly capable team”.
UPC\AC Renewables was formed as a joint venture in 2018, and Brian Caffyn, CEO and Founder of the international company UPC Renewables says, “The joint initiatives we have established in the renewable energy sector are a testament to what the teams can bring together and take ACEN to the next stage of growth.”
Through ACEN, Ayala Corp aims to become the largest listed renewable platform in Southeast Asia, and Forbes magazine reports the company has raised US$1 billion so far this year from a combination of initiatives, including green bonds, a rights issue, and a private placement to Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, to support its expansion plans.
UPC Renewables itself is headquartered in Boulder, Colorado in the US. With completed early projects in the US, Canada and Europe, it more recently turned its  focus to the Asia-Pacific region where it has a 1 GW portfolio of operating renewable energy assets and 10 GW of projects in the pipeline.
UAC Energy, jointly owned by ACEN and UPC\AC Renewables, was last year involved in a takeover battle for Infigen Energy, Australia’s then largest ASX-listed renewable energy generator, developer and retailer, which it lost to Spanish energy giant Iberdrola. 
Separately to the ACEN acquisition, UPC Renewables and its Australian CEO Anton Rohner have agreed to buy up to 942 million AC Energy shares for a total consideration of US $210 million, which will give them a stake of around 2.5% in AC Energy.
