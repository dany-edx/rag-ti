Energy Bay will purchase Stockland’s existing ~17 MWp of solar panels already installed on the property developer’s town centre locations. Energy Bay has agreed to then install an additional ~34 MWp of solar infrastructure across Stockland’s assets by 2025 and to exclusively sell that energy to Stockland for 15 years at agreed rates.
Stockland’s Executive General Manager, Workplace, Emlyn Keane, said the partnership allows Stockland to use its own rooftops rather than requiring additional land for solar farms. This allows Stockland to avoid the premium cost of renewable energy power purchasing agreements.
“The use of our existing commercial property assets combined with our $6.4 billion logistics pipeline will see approximately 250,000 square metres of solar panels installed on our roofs, the equivalent of around 35 football fields,” Keane said.
The scheme allows energy to be traded among Stockland assets, which number more than 50 properties, making use of the abundant roof space and low energy usage at Stockland’s logistics and warehouse properties so that excess energy generated can be used at other properties across the Stockland Group that include residential, workplace and retail locations.

Energy Bay Chief Executive Officer James Doyle said “through this partnership, Energy Bay will develop, install, and operate a major renewable energy platform, right on the rooftop of Stockland’s vast commercial assets, on-selling the energy produced back to Stockland at a competitive price point.”
Established in 2016, Energy Bay works with its subsidiary Solar Bay, which specialises in providing renewable energy infrastructure for commercial and industrial properties.
In April 2020, Solar Bay committed $350 million to a solar buyback initiative to fund solar projects in the commercial and industrial sectors throughout Australia and the Asia Pacific. Solar Bay’s offerings include electricity supply agreements, battery storage, electric vehicle charging infrastructure and demand response services.
Both Energy Bay and Stockland have strong background in finance and know the value of environment, social and governance (ESG) reporting, which is rapidly becoming as important for a company’s financial health as its financial reports.
The agreement with Energy Bay will not only secure renewable energy resources but also allow Stockland to significantly reduce its scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions – a key element of ESG reporting. The first two, scope 1 and 2 emissions, are caused by a company’s direct operations, which will be diminished with the provision of renewable energy facilitated by Energy Bay and Solar Bay.
Scope 3 emissions – those caused upstream and downstream of a company’s activities in interaction with both their suppliers and customers – can also be reduced thanks to this collaboration.
The two companies say that as the partnership progresses, Stockland will explore how its tenants can drive down their emissions, reducing Stockland’s scope 3 emissions as well. The expectation here is that Stockland will be able to halve its scope 3 emissions by 2030.
According to Stockland, prior to the agreement with Energy Bay, it had already achieved a 13% reduction of emissions across its commercial property portfolio since the 2020 financial year, which exceeded its own targets of 10% and 80% since 2006. The property giant said this was due to its steadily growing onsite renewable energy generation. The agreement with Energy Bay should take this to a whole other level, enabling Stockland to reach its target of net zero scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/07/energyaustralia-pushes-ahead-with-335-mw-pumped-hydro-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,PUMPED HYDRO,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 7, 2023",EnergyAustralia pushes ahead with 335 MW pumped hydro project,"Electricity gen-tailer EnergyAustralia has unveiled design details for its proposed Lake Lyell Pumped Hydro Project, providing an overview of key project elements including the upper reservoir design, site access roads, underground powerhouse, the switchyard and water intake location.
It is expected the pumped hydro facility, located approximately 110 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, will be capable of producing 335 MW of renewable energy for up eight hours during periods of peak demand.
EnergyAustralia, which is also seeking to develop a battery energy storage system at the Mt Piper site which will be able to dispatch up to 500 MW of power for up to four hours, said the pumped hydro facility will provide firming and other ancillary grid services in the Central West region, and across the state.
The project proposes to use the 32-gigalitre Lake Lyell, which was specifically built to supply water to the 1.4 GW Mount Piper coal-fired power station that is scheduled to close in 2040, as a lower reservoir with a new upper reservoir to be built in a gully on the southwest flank of the adjacent Mt Walker.
The concept design also outlines plans for a new underground powerhouse which will contain two pump-turbines and electrical transformers. This will be accessed via two tunnels from portals built on the north side of Farmers Creek.
The project will also incorporate existing transmission assets, with the facility connecting to the National Electricity Market (NEM) via a new switchyard that will link to the existing 330 kV transmission lines that pass through the project area to the south of Mt Walker.

EnergyAustralia Project Director Michael de Vink said the concept design emphasises the company’s commitment to mitigating environmental, cultural heritage and other important impacts through “site-sensitive” design.
“This includes changes made following consultation with the community and initial environmental studies,” he said. “The siting of key elements of the project takes advantage of the natural geography of the site to avoid visual impacts, mitigate environmental impacts and maintain lake recreational access for the community.”
De Vink said the concept design will allow EnergyAustralia to plan further studies to assess the project’s environmental impact and “progress with more detailed engineering design work.”
“The next step for the project is more detailed assessments and continuing community engagement,” he said, adding that environmental studies are currently underway with findings to be included in the project’s Environmental Impact Assessment which is expected to be on public exhibition towards the end of next year.
EnergyAustralia, which is owned by Hong Kong-based CLP Group, said the Lake Lyell project is currently in the feasibility stage with a decision on proceeding likely to be made in the second half of 2025. It is anticipated construction would take at least four years, meaning the earliest the facility could be operating is 2029.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/07/australia-ranked-fifth-most-attractive-market-for-renewables-investors/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 7, 2023",Australia ranked fifth most attractive market for renewables investors,"Australia has risen to fifth position in the 62nd edition of EY’s biannual Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index (RECAI). This is up from seventh place in the previous index and comes on the back of what the report describes as a “series of positive renewable energy and related infrastructure developments.”
“Australia has granted federal approval for one of the world’s largest batteries to be built at the Melbourne Renewable Energy Hub,” EY said, adding that the decision “signals a breakthrough for energy storage” in Australia.
EY also noted that the federal government has “earmarked up to $3 billion (USD 1.97 billion) from the National Reconstruction Fund for renewables manufacturing to combat supply chain challenges.”
The release of the report follows the federal government’s recent announcement that it would expand its Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) to drive the development of new renewable energy projects as it seeks to achieve its target of generating 82% of Australia’s electricity from renewable sources by 2030.
The revised CIS, announced late last month, will ramp up from 6 GW of storage to more than 9 GW of dispatchable capacity, and will add 23 GW of variable renewable energy generation. Currently, Australia boasts about 32 GW of renewable energy within its grid.
“The country has set itself ambitious targets to increase the share of energy produced from renewable sources and, as indicated by the recent government measures announced, to facilitate access to these sources,” EY said in a statement.
Since 2003, the biannual RECAI has ranked the world’s top 40 markets on the attractiveness of their renewable energy investment and deployment opportunities.
Australia’s fifth place ranking on the index, with a RECAI score of 70.2, places it behind the United States with 73.9, Germany (71.4), China (71.4) and France (70.6). Rounding out the top 10 are India (69.2), the United Kingdom (68.3), Spain (67.1), Denmark (66.3) and the Netherlands (66.1).
EY said Australia has performed even more impressively in the “normalised index” which takes the gross domestic product (GDP) of each nation into account.
“In this way, the normalised index helps reveal ambitious plans for energy transition in smaller economies, creating some attractive alternatives for potential investors,” EY said.
Here, Australia has risen to fourth place, edged out by Denmark, Morocco and Greece.
Australia has also maintained its ranking in the power purchase agreements market, remaining steady in sixth place as “more and more corporates” target new deals.

When fully operational, the solar plant will be capable of generating about 11,000 MWh of clean energy each year.
Originally developed by Japan-headquartered Bison, the solar farm was acquired in early 2022 by renewable energy investor and fund manager Green Squares Energy, in partnership with superannuation firm Future Super.
Bison has remained involved as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor as well as the operations and maintenance (O&M) contractor on the project.
The Cosgrove Solar Farm is one of a suite of solar and battery energy storage projects that Bison is progressing in Victoria and New South Wales. The company said it is working on a portfolio of solar projects ranging from sub 5 MW – including the 4.95 MW Bostock Creek Solar Farm which is currently being built near Cobden in southwest Victoria – to larger-scale projects from 60 MW up to a new 800 MW solar and battery energy storage project which has just commenced development in southern NSW.
Bison is also working on a pipeline of standalone battery energy storage projects ranging from 5 MW to 100 MW with a mix of 2-4 hours storage. Among these is the 60 MW/240 MWh Bairnsdale battery energy storage system being developed in southeast Victoria.
In addition to its Australian assets, Bison has four solar projects in New Zealand with a combined capacity of almost 100 MW under development.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/07/empirical-approach-shows-pv-is-getting-cheaper-than-all-the-forecasters-expect/,"FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"DECEMBER 7, 2023",Empirical approach shows PV is getting cheaper than all the forecasters expect,"From pv magazine Global | Opinion & Analysis
Energy-transition forecasts have regularly fallen short in the past. The global change in energy supply is taking place faster than expected but such knowledge has not led to more accurate forecasts.
With empirically-based modelling the most reliable approach, DR Dahlmeier Financial Risk Management has applied it to the anticipated growth of PV to 2030 – with surprising results.
Previous technological transitions, as analysed by Doyne Farmer and his Oxford University team, have begun with exponential growth followed by linear growth before levelling off, in a characteristic “s-curve.”
The volume of PV deployed worldwide has roughly doubled every two years over the past 48 years. Each doubling has brought a price reduction of around 23% and there is little variance from that pattern.
At some point the incline should become more gentle but when will that happen for solar?
The graph below shows the energy markets where new-build solar or wind sites were cheaper than new coal and gas power plants, during the first half of 2022. Current solar panel prices already make the estimates used below look costly.

Source: BloombergNEF
In almost all industrialized countries, wind or solar energy is the cheapest source of electricity from new large-scale plants. Photovoltaic power plants undercut production costs of around $0.01/kWh in 2020, in sunny regions, and the current PV price trend enables even lower production costs. The average costs shown in the Bloomberg chart above could be significantly undercut with new systems. Since November 2022 alone, PV module prices have roughly halved, to a record low. To put that into perspective, electricity prices on the European Energy Exchange in Leipzig averaged €30 ($49) per megawatt-hour in 2020 and have fluctuated between €77/MWh and €102/MWh since March 2023. Photovoltaic electricity from large systems has, therefore, not only long been competitive it is now by far the cheapest source of electricity from new systems.
Pricing is different for small systems, where final electricity consumption price is the decisive factor. Self-generated solar power is already cheaper than grid electricity almost everywhere, making home solar systems economically attractive.
Solar module prices have fallen more than 99.8% since 1976. Study of almost 3,000 forecasts has revealed just how unambitious analysts have been in predicting solar panel price declines. Between 2010 and 2020, the most ambitious analysts predicted a 6% annual fall in price, with predictions averaging out at 2.6% per year. Prices actually retreated 15% per year.
Those inaccurate price predictions affected the resulting solar deployment forecasting models, particularly the integrated assessment models (IAMs) which dominate economic modelling. pv magazine has reported on unambitious modeling and forecasts, particularly by the IEA.
What alternative modelling approaches exist?
Using an empirical approach, my team estimates solar’s exponential expansion phase will continue beyond 2030. We expect the volume of installed solar generation capacity to rise from 1.24 TW, in 2022, to around 14 TW in 2030. The module price will fall from USD 0.22 per Watt-peak of generation capacity, in summer 2023, to USD 0.097/Wp in 2030. Global volume will rise by a factor of 11 and the price will more than halve. The following chart shows the expected volume growth and price reduction from 2023 as a forecast based on previous developments.

Trend extrapolation from 2023 to 2030, shown in double logarithmic scaling
Conservative estimates indicate the result would be a consistent solar energy generation cost of less than USD 0.02/kWh in central Europe and below USD 0.01/kWh in Southern Europe and the southern United States.
Our empirical modelling is characterized by transparent, comprehensible assumptions and lower complexity than the dominant approach. The modelling developed by our team – independently of Farmer, at Oxford University – delivers fundamentally identical results. Thus, our methodology can be regarded as independently validated by that of Oxford University. While other models do not aim to apply to historical development, empirical modelling integrates historical figures and builds on them.

Presentation of the historical and expected development in PV until 2030
The expected deployment figures are reflected in the chart above.
The modelling is based on a large number of technology transitions. Deviations from the trend are possible. Solar development may be faster or slower but the trend provides the expected value, or forecast, of 14 TW globally and a module price of USD 0.097/Wp. We do not derive any statements about national or regional development from the model at this point.
As pv magazine has reported, non-empirical modelling approaches have prompted much lower forecasts. For example, analyst Wood Mackenzie’s “Q3 2023 Global solar market outlook update” produced a 2030 figure of 3.65 TW of solar. Our estimate is for 2.8 TW of solar in 2029 alone.
Is that too optimistic, given the much-publicised problem of storing electricity generated by intermittent renewables? This issue has been resolved in principle. US-based investor Warren Buffett’s Gemini solar project provides round-the-clock solar power, supported by battery storage, for USD 0.033/kWh. The ultra-high-voltage, direct current transmission system installed by ABB in China transmits electricity 3,200 km – between Changji and Guquan – with low losses. Those two projects demonstrate 24/7 solar power can be delivered economically almost anywhere. The United Kingdom is planning the “Xlinks Morocco-UK Power Project” and Egypt, Cyprus, and Greece are planning similar infrastructure.
Based on empirical evidence, the long-term global exponential trend for solar is unlikely to slow down before the end of the decade and probably not before 2034, if only due to the favorable prices of solar power from new systems. How this global trend will continue, whether it will increasingly focus on sunny regions, and whether such regions will sell us energy in the form of electricity in the future or whether PV electricity will be produced and stored locally, depends on politics.
Renewables not only have the potential to enable a CO2-neutral economy. They are already a basis for stable economic growth on the path to global climate neutrality and they help to reduce energy costs. We should utilize the opportunities that present themselves, also in terms of limiting climate change and of carrying out our responsibility for the planet.
