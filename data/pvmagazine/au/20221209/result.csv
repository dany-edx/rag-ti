The Australian Silicon Action Plan (ASAP), commissioned by the CSIRO and authored by PricewaterhouseCoopers Australia (PwC), urges Australia to “quickly” develop a fully-fledged domestic supply chain for silicon and solar cells to improve the nation’s energy independence and sovereign capability.
CSIRO Senior Principal Research Scientist Dr Chris Vernon said the report highlights that Australia has great potential when it comes to the leading role it can play in the global energy transition but its current reliance on concentrated silicon and solar cell supply chains risks holding it back.
“Australia already has the highest per capita deployment of rooftop solar in the world, and there are several mega-projects in the solar development pipeline,” he said. “But one of the greatest risks to Australia’s solar ambitions and energy future is our reliance on overseas supply chains for solar cell technology.”
Modelling conducted by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) shows that the deployment of solar power technology, at increasing scale, will be critical to the success of the global energy transition.
Solar’s contribution to the energy mix in Australia is expected to increase from 12% to approximately 50% by 2050, while IRENA estimates annual global solar power generation capacity must increase more than five-fold by 2030, and 14-fold by 2050 to stay on track for net-zero targets.
To keep pace with these solar capacity forecasts, annual global production of silicon and its purified form polysilicon – critical for its importance to new economy technologies such as solar cells, semiconductors (chips), optical fibres, aluminium alloys, and its potential use in energy storage batteries – will have to materially increase.

Australia currently imports about 80% of its solar panels from China, which also controls the vast amount of materials processing for other renewable technologies. China currently controls about 90% of the global production of refined rare earths, and the majority of critical minerals. About 70% of silicon is produced in China, and it also dominates the production of polysilicon. The conversion of polysilicon to solar cells is even more concentrated, with China accounting for between 75% and 97% of these stages of production.
The CSIRO said increasing production of silicon in Australia is the first step for the nation to develop its own capability and capacity in the solar cell supply chain.
According to the report, Australia can develop a fully integrated silicon and solar cell supply chain, from quartz mining through to manufacturing, end-of-life processes, and recycling to support and de-risk the overall solar supply chain.
“This supply chain starts with our endowment of high-quality quartz, which can be processed to metallurgical grade silicon, then to solar grade polysilicon,” Vernon said, adding “energy independence should be a top priority for Australia.”

To achieve the desired goals, the ASAP outlines “achievable” recommendations and actions for government and industry to pursue, including incentivising the supply of raw materials and building Australia’s capacity in silicon production; developing ingot, wafer and solar cell manufacturing capabilities; and expanding the nation’s supply chain activity.
Vernon said the vision will not be achieved without “a high level of collaboration between all stakeholders, from miners and refiners to state and federal governments, to R&D providers, to the manufacturing industry.”
Federal Industry Minister Ed Husic said the ASAP is a welcome contribution to discussions about how best to establish new manufacturing capabilities in Australia and noted the potential alignment with the recently announced National Reconstruction Fund, including value-adding in resources and for renewables and low-emissions technologies.
“The report highlights the part silicon plays in new technologies such as solar cells, semiconductor chips, optical fibres, aluminium alloys and its potential for use in batteries,” he said.
“As I’ve said previously, if we mine it here, we should make it here.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/09/epic-views-battery-option-as-part-of-mannum-solar-farm-expansion/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 9, 2022",Epic views battery option as part of Mannum Solar Farm expansion,"South Australia-headquartered energy infrastructure company Epic Energy will explore the potential to add battery energy storage capacity at its Mannum Solar Farm as work continues on a 39 MWdc expansion of the large-scale solar project in the state’s Riverland region.
Epic Energy, which already owns and operates a 6.8 MWp solar farm at Mannum, around 90 kilometres east of Adelaide, said the company the project is part of the company’s strategy to grow its portfolio of renewable energy assets as part of the transition to a new energy future.
The company, which owns two of South Asutralia’s major gas transmission pipelines as part of a gas network spanning more 1,200kms, has in recent years branched out into renewable energy generation. Its portfolio of renewable infrastructure includes the IKEA Adelaide solar and battery microgrid, and the Timboon West and Yawong wind farms in Victoria’s northwest.
“We are investing in a portfolio of renewable energy assets for our customers, with infrastructure ranging from wind and solar farms to microgrids and standalone storage,” Epic Energy Chief Executive Clive D’Cruz said.
“We also have plans to further build our wind portfolio, with another approximately 120 MW under development in Victoria to add to our existing Timboon West and Yawong Wind Farms.”

D’Cruz said the expansion leverages Epic Energy’s expertise to support the energy market’s transition to renewables.
“The Riverland’s consistent sunlight and location on the electricity grid presents a significant opportunity to meet the growing renewable energy needs of industrial customers,” he said.
Epic Energy acquired the initial stage of the Mannum Solar Farm from Chinese-Canadian solar heavyweight Canadian Solar in November 2020, and exercised an the option to purchase the second stage of the project in August, 2022.
The 39 MWdc second stage of the Mannum Solar Farm is expected to commence operations in late 2023. The $50 million (USD 33.5 million) facility will have its own connection to SA Power Networks’ distribution network and will operate independently of the initial 6.8 MWdc solar farm which was commissioned in 2019.
The second stage will utilise bifacial panels, along with Sungrow inverters and a single-axis tracking system while Hengtong Cable Australia has been awarded the cable supply contract.
Construction and the first two years of operations and maintenance will be managed by Enzen Australia.
Epic Energy said the second stage is supported by a power purchase deal with Orora Packaging Solutions which has secured the offtake to help power operations at its glass manufacturing facility at Kingsford near Gawler.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/09/six-tips-for-renewable-energy-tender-writing/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"DECEMBER 9, 2022",Six tips for renewable energy tender writing,"To that end, governments and private investors have poured money into the research and development of large-scale solar projects, with many adopting a tendering process for the procurement of suitable solar industry service suppliers.
Here are some practical tips and strategies to make your bid stand out.
It is important to understand the goals of the company whose work you are bidding for. Doing research to recognise their financial, environmental, and quality concerns, as well as their brand, vision, and other goals is vital when producing a winning solar energy proposal.
By making sure you not only meet the requirements specified in the Request for Proposal (RFP), but also the values and concerns shared internally by your potential client, you give them a sense you are the right service provider for them.
One aspect of tendering for solar projects that is regularly overlooked, or undervalued, is a thorough, detailed description of all the equipment and technology your company uses. PV cells use varying technologies.
Elaborate on which technologies you use. For example, explain whether you use crystalline silicon-based, thin-film solar cells, or a hybrid version — detailing the method with which they are constructed. Elaborate further on the benefit of said technologies as well as the brand, or brands you deal with.
Detailing these specifications in your proposal will give the client certainty you are using high quality equipment and technology, and not low cost, poor quality solar panels that will fail and cause losses in money, time, and energy.
Solar industry clients want a partner who is committed for the long-term. Include in your proposal information about your company’s history, experience, and qualifications in completing renewable energy projects. Including the total number of megawatts installed, projects completed, and how many years your company has been operating.
Detail which specific areas of the project your company will complete, and which parts will be handled by partners you work with, or factories you have contracts with to provide services. Provide details on how you conduct due diligence on your partners to ensure they share your commitment to quality, values and the environment.
Having all your services and experience listed, as well as the contractors you use, can make your proposal more attractive and it relieves the workload on the client to procure a broad range of services. Lastly, provide profiles of your board and management, so they know who’s who and what experience you have. Providing evidence of company certificates, licenses, insurance, and any other affiliation you may have with industry bodies is often a requirement, and it is best to include these even if they haven’t been requested
Displaying dedication to maintaining your solar systems will give your desired client confidence in your abilities and long-term commitment. Solar farms are often located in harsh, desert locations, with high temperatures and dusty conditions.
While high-quality solar equipment is reliable, it is important under such conditions to constantly clean and maintain all components of the farm, ensuring the entire system runs smoothly for the projects lifespan. Once again, disclose whether your company completes the maintenance, or whether you use a contractor.
High-quality graphics and infographics are becoming more prevalent in proposals, particularly ones involving specific data or technical information. Ensuring they have meaning is crucial.
When incorporating images of your services into a proposal, utilise a call out box and elaborate on where you added real value. Evidence your performance claims with facts and figures — display data from a previous solar project you provided a service to, or a problem you solved. For example, demonstrating the number of kilowatt-hours compared to watts installed is an effective way of showing how much energy they are saving by running a project on solar energy.
Finally, once you have completed all your research it is time to put it into writing. Like your team, the client will have a team of highly experienced solar, civil, and electrical engineers, as well as procurement and renewable energy management professionals. Submitting a proposal with high-quality marketing, full of technical terms and data won’t be enough to persuade professional and experienced reviewers. Neither will they want to read about the services you will deliver without a detailed and specific plan of how you’ll achieve it.
Your bid needs to be written in a concise manner, one tailored to the specific project and backed up with evidence.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/09/energy-ministers-sign-off-on-capacity-mechanism/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 9, 2022",Energy ministers sign off on capacity mechanism,"Australia’s federal, state and territory energy ministers have signed off on a Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) that will incentivise new investment in renewable energy generation backed by batteries, pumped hydro and other long-duration storage technologies to support the ongoing decarbonisation of the grid.
The CIS, agreed to at a meeting of energy ministers in Brisbane on Thursday and to be underwritten and guaranteed by the Commonwealth, will provide the national framework to ensure there will be a reliable supply of clean dispatchable power, regardless of conditions in the market.
Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the new revenue underwriting mechanism will unlock about $10 billion worth of investment in renewable electricity backed by storage technologies to support reliability and security as the energy market undergoes its biggest transformation since the industrial revolution.
“It will firm-up our grids, providing extra capacity as more and more power stations leave the power grid. As more and more coal-fired power stations inevitably close, we will firm the grid going forward,” he said.
As part of its legislated target of net zero emissions by 2050, the Australian government is targeting a 43% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030. Meeting the government’s 2030 target will mean boosting renewable energy production to 82% of the nation’s electricity supply.
With at least five of Australia’s coal-fired power stations set to close before the end of the decade, Australia needs to install 45 GW of new supply by 2030, including about 36 GW from renewable generation like solar and wind.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has forecast that about 9 GW of new firming capacity like pumped hydro, batteries, and lower-emissions gas generation will be needed by 2030 to unlock those renewables but warned that by 2050 that figure will climb to about 60 GW.

Bowen said by accelerating new investment, the CIS will encourage the ideal mix of storage and renewable technologies needed in the system over the coming decade.
“It’s a ‘keeping the lights on’ mechanism, you’ve heard us talk about it many, many times, it’s been in the too-hard basket for a long time,” he said.
“This is a sensible, carefully designed mechanism, which will unleash investment in clean dispatchable energy right across Australia.”
The government will conduct auctions for dispatchable renewable energy in close consultation with the jurisdiction for the capacity and agree to floor and ceiling revenue for the projects to help cover project operating costs and debt repayments. If revenue is below the floor, the Commonwealth will pay the difference, and if the ceiling is exceeded, it will share in the profits.
The scheme will not include payments to coal-fired plants, which had been part of a separate capacity market scheme prepared by energy regulators earlier this year.
Bowen said the capacity scheme would complement existing state and territory schemes, such as the NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap, and therefore not alter competitive tenders currently underway.
While further details on how the CIS will be structured are yet to be announced, its anticipated the first auction as part of the capacity mechanism will occur in 2023.
Clean Energy Council (CEC) Chief Executive Kane Thornton described the scheme as a win for investors but cautioned that more work needs to be done to support investment in renewable energy projects.
“While measures to accelerate storage rollout are important, we also need to develop the markets and technical frameworks that will enable stable, long-term investment in storage,” he said.
“Renewable energy is the only answer to keep energy affordable in the long term.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/09/how-clean-energy-technologies-achieve-commercial-success/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 9, 2022",How clean energy technologies achieve commercial success,"From pv magazine USA
Research and development is vital in the development of new technologies, yet they have many obstacles to overcome before they can move from the lab to the marketplace. Analysts from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Joint Institute for Strategic Energy Analysis (JISEA), and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) analysed case studies of the first commercialisation of four clean energy technologies: thin-film photovoltaic (PV) solar panels, wind turbines, dual-stage evaporators for refrigeration, and fuel cells for material handling equipment.
Findings across the case studies—published in a Frontiers in Energy Research article—revealed three components common to successful advancement to commercialisation: (1) a good fit among public-private partnerships, R&D infrastructure, and the technology itself; (2) appropriate alignment of government regulations, R&D priorities, and market forces; and (3) the right timing between technology readiness and market opportunity.
“These findings can help inform clean energy investment decision-making, maximise benefits from R&D, and advance transition to a productive, low-emission future,” said Wyatt Merrill, DOE technology manager and co-author.
The thin-film solar case study focuses on First Solar, a U.S.-based manufacturer that benefited from DOE solar research, and directly received DOE funding in research partnerships from the 1980s to 2000s. The researchers credit First Solar’s early success to the fact that the company addressed regulatory needs within the thin-film PV technology’s first major market and established a proven product at a price and time for a market that was ready for it.
A notable advance in the early stages of thin-film research demonstrated a record (at the time) of 15.8% cell using a cadmium chloride (CdCl2) heat treating process. First Solar co-developed a high-rate vapour transport deposition manufacturing technique to produce CdTe-based modules at a larger scale, which was an alternative to the slower, costlier close space sublimation manufacturing process. With suitable device efficiency and scalable manufacturing procedures in place, the R&D focus shifted to testing and validation of product reliability. First Solar used testing standards, product quality certifications, and outdoor testing facilities funded by DOE and led by Arizona State University and NREL to prove by 2003 that its modules were ready to enter the solar market.
First Solar entered the strong Germany solar market in the 2000s. But first its modules needed to meet energy performance and regulatory requirements, which included electronic waste regulation and restrictions on the use of certain toxic substances like cadmium. A 2004 effort helped resolve concerns about emissions and recyclability of CdTe PV modules with independent, peer-reviewed studies. Later in 2004, First Solar secured its first contract for its compound thin semiconductor modules in the German PV market, which was a commercial turning point for CdTe PV. In 2005, First Solar announced a module takeback and recycling program to respond to evolving EU policy directives, an effort that helped communicate First Solar’s responsiveness to regulatory issues, and they addressed public perception of risk sufficiently to access key markets.
While CdTe modules are less efficient than silicon-based panels, they cost less to manufacture and achieved the lowest price per watt from the mid-2000s until the mid-2010s. At the same time, demand for PV products in Europe outpaced supply, and First Solar was able to capitalise on its technology.
“The thin-film PV case study shows the importance of addressing regulatory needs within the technology’s first major market,” said Marie Mapes, DOE technology manager and co-author. “In addition, establishing a proven product at a price and time when the market was ready for it led to its early success.”
The key findings in the thin-film PV case study identified the successful use of three key commercialisation strategies: development of technology with many commercially relevant inputs through public/private partnerships, alignment of set technology cost goals and product development that achieved them, and timing compatibility of technology readiness and market opportunity. First Solar’s thin-film development benefited from government funding over decades, which enabled foundational materials research and consistent testing standards. What resulted was a prepared company with the right product at the right time. CdTe photovoltaics of proven reliability were a lower-cost replacement in a clean energy market with an open window of opportunity, allowing the early commercialisation success of this solar technology.
The four case studies highlight how a good balance of technology, R&D, and public-private partnership—along with regulatory and market force alignment and the right timing—can lead to successful first commercialisation of clean energy technologies.

This is a considerable increase compared to 2020, when renewable energy loans accounted for 74%, according to the fifth edition of Coal vs Renewable Financial Analysis by Climate Trends and Centre for Financial Accountability (CFA).
A total of INR 33,893 crore (USD 4,598 million/$6,832 million) flowed to renewable energy projects, all of which were solar and wind. The total capacity across all projects identified was 8.5 GW. Like in 2020, solar power dominated with a 83% share of renewables financing deals. Wind’s share stood at 17%.
L&T Finance replaced State Bank of India (SBI) as the biggest financier for renewable energy projects in 2021.
“The total funding for new energy projects in 2021 was 60% down from 2017 levels, and no new finance went to coal power projects in the year 2021. Financing for renewable energy projects, on the other hand, recorded a 39% year-on-year increase from 2020,” said the authors.
The study assessed 44 project finance loans across 42 coal and renewable energy ( hydroelectric, geothermal, wave, wind or solar) projects in India that reached a financial closure between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021.
“The writing is on the wall. Lending institutions are increasingly moving away from coal lending given the risks. After Federal Bank, the first commercial bank to have announced a coal exit policy, Sarvodaya Small Finance Bank has also announced an end to financing coal projects. This should signal to institutions who have either provided loans or underwriting services, or have shareholdings in coal companies to rethink their lending,” said Joe Athially, Executive Director, Centre for Financial Accountability.
L&T Finance poured INR 4,214 crore into the RE sector in 2021. Rajasthan (INR 22,187 crore) followed by Gujarat (INR 4,025 crore) were the top beneficiaries of renewable energy lending. Collectively, these two states accounted for 77% of all renewable energy loans.
