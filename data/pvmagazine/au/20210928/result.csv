The Peak Demand Reduction Scheme, as it’s named, will provide NSW households and businesses with discounts to install technologies like smart pool pumps or household batteries which can shift when electricity is used, with the government claiming the scheme to be a “world-first”.
“If all the backyard pool pumps and filters across NSW were used outside of peak periods, we could save up to 450 MW – that’s more than the capacity of a generating unit at the Liddell Power Station,” NSW Energy Minister Matt Kean said in a statement.
The scheme is set to kick into action in time for the 2022-23 summer, with the NSW government saying it has additionally invested $25 million “to support the development of emerging technologies and software that allow households and businesses to use power when it is cheap and abundant.”
Why managing demand is key to decarbonising
Due to the massive penetrations of rooftop solar in Australia, many regions’ grids now experience what’s known as a duck curve – when too much renewable energy is generated during daylight hours, only for production to cease before evening demand peaks.
This misalignment of demand and supply means that much solar electricity is currently wasted. As software develops, however, it’s possible to program appliances, and even homes and businesses to consume power for non-time sensitive activities (like pumping a backyard pool or charging batteries) so as to soak up excess renewable electricity during the hours it’s abundant (and therefore cheap) rather than when the sun goes down and everyone starts switching on their ovens for dinner. 
Household batteries are the most obvious way to ‘solar shift’ but increasingly energy management platforms and smart appliances are proving helpful. In May, minister Kean also launched electricity distributor Endeavour Energy and smart metering company Intellihub’s Off Peak Plus program on the state’s south coast. It involved 2,500 homes across Albion Park, being installed with smart meters to dynamically control homes’ hot water systems, meaning they can be switched on during the day when there is cheap surplus energy in the grid.
“There are so many easy ways to reduce our peak consumption without impacting our way of life,” Minister Kean said.
Fuel switching activities covered
The government also said “fuel switching activities” will be added to its existing Energy Savings Scheme. “This will include incentives for households to switch to solar and heat-pump hot water systems, and for businesses to replace gas, diesel or grid supplied electricity with renewable energy technologies like a biogas boiler,” it said.
“By reducing peak demand we can supply power to everyone who needs it, when they need it, at a lower cost,” Kean said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/28/australias-biggest-battery-cleared-for-testing-following-fire-fallout/,"ENERGY STORAGE,LEGAL,LOOKING BACK,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2021",Australia’s biggest battery cleared for testing following fire debacle,"The investigation into the fire which broke out during the commissioning of Australia’s biggest battery has today had its findings released, with the most likely root cause deemed to be a leak within its Tesla Megapack cooling system.
One of the largest battery energy storage systems in the world, the fire at the Neoen-owned 300 MW / 450 MWh Victorian Big Battery unsurprisingly led to renewed global discussions around the safety of lithium-ion battery technologies.
The multi-party independent investigation into the fire uncovered that the system in place to detect faults didn’t set off alarms because it hadn’t been given adequate time to ‘map’ the control system, which generally takes around 24 hours. 
The Megapack which caught fire had been switched to offline mode after just 13 hours in service, meaning the protection systems which should have been operating and providing oversight did not do so.
In its Statement of Technical Findings published this morning, Energy Safe Victoria said: “the cause of the fire was identified as coinciding short circuits in two particular locations likely initiated by a coolant leak external to the battery compartment… Enabled by this unlikely sequence of events the fault was able to go undetected and initiate a fire in the adjacent battery compartment.”
“Mitigating actions have been put in place at the facility and across Tesla’s global Megapack fleet, including a combination of firmware enhancements, as well as monitoring and process improvements,” Energy Safe Victoria’s statement read. You can find the list of those actions at the end of this article.

Following the conclusion of the investigations, which additionally involved the Country Fire Authority, WorkSafe Victoria, and the Environment Protection Authority, regulatory authorities have provided Neoen and Tesla with approval to resume energisation testing from tomorrow, September 29.
Energy Safe Victoria said in its statement that learnings from the event are currently being compiled by two independent expert groups, Energy Safety Response Group & Fisher Engineering, with an Independent Report to be released by November. “Information and insights, including lessons for fire management and emergency response, will be publicly shared to support the industry and relevant authorities in the deployment of battery storage technology.”
“We have taken the time to understand the cause of the incident and we have implemented actions to ensure it will not happen again,” Louis de Sambucy, Neoen Australia’s Managing Director said. “We are now actively working with all stakeholders to complete commissioning and testing of the project and we look forward to sharing the lessons learnt with the industry in coming weeks.”

Prompted by the Victorian fire, the issue of large-scale battery performance and safety is also the topic of pv magazine’s upcoming Insight Australia event, which which will include a case study of the event.
It was around 10:30am on July 30 when 150 firefighters responded to a fire at the site of Victoria Big Battery being developed near the Moorabool Terminal Station at Geelong. Fire crews arrived to a 13-tonne lithium battery ablaze in a shipping container, which wasn’t brought under control until the afternoon of Monday August 2, three days later.
The fire destroyed two of the project’s 212 Tesla Megapacks.
Originally slated for completion by November, Neoen said today it is still aiming for the battery to be operational in time for Australia’s summer, typically the period of highest grid demand. 
In November 2020, AEMO in fact awarded the Victorian Big Battery a 10-year contract under the System Integrity Protection Scheme, which will require the battery’s operators to reserve 250 MW of its capacity to participate in increasing the capability of the Victoria-to-New South Wales Interconnector (VNI) and respond to unexpected network outages.

Neoen could be considered a preeminent force in Australia’s push for grid-scale battery storage projects, with the company recently securing tenders for the first stage of the Goyder South project in South Australia and a big battery in Canberra. The French firm also owns the soon-to-be commissioned 20 MW/ 34 MWh Bulgana green power hub in north west Victoria, and of course the project which brought its preeminence, the Hornsdale Power Reserve, better known as the South Australian Tesla Big Battery.
Be that as it may, the recent fire wasn’t the only heat the French developer has been feeling.

Just last Friday, the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) instituted proceedings in the federal court against the company in regard to its 150 MW/194 MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve (HPR) for alleged breaches of the National Electricity Rules. The AER claimed Neoen’s South Australian facility did not provide the frequency control services it was paid for.
“Between July and November 2019, HPR made offers to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and was paid to provide market ancillary services which allegedly it could not in fact provide, including when required to provide those services after a frequency disturbance,” the AER said in a statement.
The AER is seeking pecuniary penalties, declarations and costs.
Neoen Australia’s MD Sambucy has chosen not to comment on the specific allegations but in a brief statement said HPR had repeatedly delivered on high expectations since opening for business in 2017, in terms of “its performance and market impact, positively impacting ancillary service prices and proving itself to be a critical component of the South Australian electricity network”.
“Whilst we are disappointed by the AER decision, we will continue to maintain our collaborative relationship with them,” he said.
In regard to the Victorian Big Battery fire, the following actions have been enforced:
Designers are also working to ensure that Megapacks are engineered to fully mitigate the risk of fire propagation from one unit to another under Victorian climatic conditions, with proposed mitigation procedures to be rolled out to applicable Megapacks globally.

The Indian government’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for gigawatt-scale manufacturing of high-efficiency solar modules has received bids for 54.8 GW of capacity, with participation from existing manufacturers and new players alike. Half of the 18 bidders are new to solar manufacturing.
The shortlist includes Adani Infrastructure, Jindal India Solar, Reliance New Energy, and Shirdi Sai Electricals, with each of them winning top marks because they offer the full extent of integration up to the polysilicon production stage and a maximum capacity of 4 GW each. U.S. thin-film module maker First Solar is also a strong contender.
The shortlist also includes Coal India, CubicPV, Larsen and Toubro, and ReNew Power, which submitted bids for module fabs integrated up to ingot-wafer production from outsourced polysilicon. Avaada Energy, Acme Solar, Emmvee PV, Jupiter Solar, Megha Engineering, Premier Energies, Tata Power Solar, Vikram Solar, and Waaree Energies are also bidders for cell and module manufacturing.
The shortlisted applicants will file bids based on the level of PLI funding they will require for five years after their planned factories are commissioned. The maximum incentive to a single manufacturer will be tied to 2 GW of its annual production capacity, or half of the planned output of its facility – whichever is lower.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/28/china-pledges-not-to-build-new-coal-plants-abroad-yet-questions-remain/,"MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,CHINA,WORLD",ILIAS TSAGAS,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2021",China pledges not to build new coal plants abroad yet questions remain,"From pv magazine Global
“China will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad,” said China’s President Xi Jinping via a video recording at the United Nations General Assembly annual summit, which this year follows a hybrid virtual-physical presence format after being hosted almost entirely online a year ago.
China is using its so-called ‘Belt and Road Initiative’ (BRI) to finance and build several infrastructure projects in developing nations, including power plants, ports, and roads, among others.
The announcement is welcome news because it holds the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the developing world. However, Xi Jinping’s pledge did not include enough details to see climate activists celebrating just yet. Specifically, it remains to be seen when China’s pledge will come into force, whether it includes older coal plants that have been approved but not yet built, and whether financing coal plants to be built by others remains on paper.
To many, the news of China’s recent pledge did not come as a surprise. For example, about a year ago, Pakistan’s prime minister said Pakistan would stop commissioning new coal plants. Although the announcement did not include existing projects under development, the decision nevertheless demonstrated that partners to China’s BRI do not have to take whatever China offers.
Similarly, a report published in January by the Global Energy Monitor (GEM), a non-profit organisation funded by the U.S.-based Ford Foundation, the German Institute for International Cooperation, and the European Climate Fund, found that since 2014, the coal project pipeline of the world’s leading coal power nations has shrunk by around two-thirds. Of these countries, only South Africa is not in Asia.
Despite the promising market trends and China’s pledge to stop building new coal plants abroad, the transition from coal to low carbon energy sources won’t necessarily be immediate.
pv magazine recently published a feature examining the factors that inhibit solar power in Asia. The analysis showed that such factors include the lack of an adequate business and regulatory infrastructure to help smaller businesses develop and deliver PV and the associated supply chains; institutional inertia, with many of the developing nations’ institutions (e.g., large electric utilities) exhibiting an outdated attachment to fossil fuel investments; and the availability of financing, given that Asia’s new coal-fired power investment is predominantly underpinned by export credit agency finance.
What is urgently needed is a set of reforms across the Asian and other developing nations to bring competition in their electricity markets and, thus, allow their countries to grasp the new opportunities afforded by low-cost renewables like solar PV.
China’s pledge to stop building new coal plants abroad will also mean nothing if it continues to finance coal plants built by others.
A few months ago, Michael Grubb, a professor of International Energy and Climate Change Policy at University College London (UCL), and lead author in several reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) – the United Nations’ body for assessing the science related to climate change – told pv magazine that China finances “a lot of everything” and it is unclear whether the country’s leadership has arrived at a decision as to whether it favours coal over renewables.
“Still, I’ll predict one thing: almost all those countries keen to host Chinese-funded coal plants will end up regretting it – so even might China,” he said.
It appears China has realised that building coal plants abroad is not a wise business. It now remains for the other nations to realise that coal is an economically and environmentally disastrous business; as well as China to stop building coal plants at home.
