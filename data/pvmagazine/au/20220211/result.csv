In an update released earlier this week, Banana Shire Deputy Mayor Colin Semple welcomed the beginning of construction of the 110 MW solar power plant, a first for the region widely known for its coal mining heritage.
Council said the renewable energy project, being developed about 12 km north-east of Moura and 6.5 km south-west of town of Banana, is expected to inject “significant revenue” into the local economy, generating an estimated 250 jobs during construction.
“We look forward to seeing the innovative new technology that the Moura Solar Farm will provide and watch with interest to see how the industry progresses, particularly in our region,” Semple said.
The solar farm, which will connect to the Moura Substation via an overhead transmission line, will comprise an estimated 185,000 solar modules mounted on a single axis tracking system, spread across approximately 203 hectares. There is also scope to add a battery energy storage system at a later date.
Construction company Vikcon has commenced civil works on site while fellow Queensland-based company All Energy Contracting said it had started trenching and cable lay.
Network operator Powerlink said the construction of the required connection infrastructure, including a new feeder bay at the Moura Substation and associated connection work, has already been completed.
Construction of the solar farm is expected to the completed around August 2022.

Once operational, the project is expected to generate enough renewable electricity to power more than 43,000 Australian homes. But even before it comes online, more than half of the output has been allocated through a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) with Queensland government-owned generator CS Energy.
Originally developed by Esco Pacific, the project was acquired by Mytilineos in late 2020 and is part of a growing portfolio of solar farms the Greek company is developing in Australia.
According to the company, its Australian portfolio totals 400 MW including the 75 MW Wyalong, 40 MW Corowa, and the 40 MW Junee solar farms in New South Wales (NSW). The 40 MW Wagga Solar Farm and a planned 23 MW extension, labelled Wagga 2, are also part of the portfolio.
Mytilineos said work on the Corowa, Junee and Wagga solar farms has commenced and the remaining projects in its Australian portfolio are “reaching the maturity stage and will be ready to start construction during 2022”.
Nikos Papapetrou, general manager of the RSD Business Unit, said this would further consolidating Mytilineos’ position in the wider Australian and Pacific market.
“Australia is a key market for Mytilineos’ global renewables development strategy, extending across the Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Latin America regions,” he said.
Mytilineos said the Australian projects are part of a worldwide pipeline of solar PV and energy storage projects under various stages of development that exceeds 4 GW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/11/councils-unite-to-secure-renewable-energy-purchase-agreement/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 11, 2022",Councils unite to secure renewable energy purchase agreement,"Six councils in the New South Wales’ (NSW) Hunter region have signed a 10-year power purchasing agreement (PPA) with Sydney-based retailer Mojo Power, ensuring the participating councils’ combined electricity requirements of 100 GWh for large sites and street lighting will come from renewable sources.
The six participating councils are the Upper Hunter, Muswellbrook, Lake Macquarie, Maitland, Cessnock City and Central Coast councils.
Central Coast Council chief financial officer and corporate affairs director Natalia Cowley said combining the council’s energy load with neighbouring local government areas to increase purchasing power helped leverage competitive market pricing and made good commercial sense.
“This power purchase agreement provides council with value for money, increases our use of renewable energy sources and further demonstrates council’s steadfast commitment to productivity improvements,” she said.
Muswellbrook Mayor Steve Reynolds said the agreement, which commenced in January, followed an open tender process which was conducted in September 2021, and said the winning bid from Mojo Power provided “the best value for money outcome”.
“The PPA agreement combines participating councils’ electricity requirements of 100 GWh for large sites and streetlighting and will increase sources and consumption of renewable energy within the councils’ regions,” he said.
“This agreement means stable and lower electricity costs in comparison with recent years, as well as supporting the construction of a new renewable electricity project in the region.”

The Upper Hunter Shire Council said renewable energy projects identified in the contract agreement with Mojo Power include the Upper Hunter Energy Park (UHEP), a planned wind and solar farm being developed at Owen’s Gap near Scone by Sydney-based property development and renewables company Pamada.
The planned energy park includes a 10 MW solar farm and 80 MW wind farm with plans for future storage capacity.
Pamada has said the project received planning approval from the state government in 2010 but the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment is still to make a determination.
The council said the structure of the PPA will see councils source electricity from the UHEP when the project is eventually completed but the agreement with Mojo Power allows the councils to source renewable energy from other solar and wind farms in the meantime.
Reynolds said the agreement was a great outcome for all of the councils involved.
“(This agreement) will result in stable and lower electricity costs and support the construction of new renewable electricity projects in the region,” he said.
In addition, the council said each local government area will determine how they manage environmental certificates to support their individual environmental targets over the course of the contract.
“Some of the participating councils will achieve 100% renewable electricity from the outset, while others will progressively ramp up their promotion of renewable electricity in line with their targets,” the council said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/11/what-does-the-future-hold-for-wind-and-solar-in-the-nem-seen-via-geninsights21/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"FEBRUARY 11, 2022",What does the future hold for wind and solar in the NEM – seen via GenInsights21?,"The national electricity market (NEM) – including when the money is made – is changing.  The share of renewable energy (including large-scale wind and solar, hydro and rooftop PV) in the NEM has risen from 14% at the start of 2017 to around 35% at September 2021, and with it, we see a widening difference in the relative value of generation in the evening peak compared to at midday.
It’s not just the headline average market price for a region (the time-weighted average) that’s of interest to generators. GenInsights21 calculates a GWA (Generation-Weighted) average price across generator types and compares this to the time-weighted average (what a flat-output generator would earn), finding that the discount seen by solar generators in particular has increased since 2018.  This table comes from Appendix 25 (of the 28 Appendices included):

This is a somewhat predictable outcome from increasing penetration of solar farms – that the value of solar generation will fall as the sun shines at approximately the same time across a region – but it’s worth having a detailed look, as GenInsights21 does, at what’s happening across the day.
The chart below shows spot revenue per MW of capacity across different generation types and time of day, for four years (with 2021 up to end-September). The dark purple is the 2021 data, showing the middle of the day dipping lower in value especially for solar farms, and the evening peak increasing in relative contribution to a plant’s revenue, which the wind farms are capturing but solar aren’t.
Running an hour or two later in the evening (for example with some storage) could make a large difference to a solar farm’s revenue.


You only have to look at the example of what happened in the Queensland region last week, with solar farms just missing the prize, to see a significant example of this.
Our analysis shows that forecasting of wind and solar generation is becoming more important to the secure operation of the NEM, and that semi-scheduled (large renewable) plant are becoming more active participants in the market through self-forecasting and auto-bidding.
One of the key challenges for the NEM identified in the GenInsights21 report is that variability and uncertainty are increasing, given the increasing weather dependence of supply and demand for electricity, and so the market is becoming more reliant on forecasting.
I’ll focus here on wind and solar forecasting in short-term timescales, covering the day-ahead and five-minute-ahead dispatch.
The NEM is an energy-only self-commitment market, meaning that generation with slow ramping and/or energy limitations makes its own decisions about when to make itself available to generate.
Critical inputs to this decision making include AEMO’s pre-dispatch forecasts (up to a day and a half ahead) of prices and demand for each region. The quality of these pre-dispatch forecasts depends on the forward forecasts of wind and solar generation, currently prepared by AEMO’s AWEFS and ASEFS forecasting systems.
In GenInsights21 we investigated how well these forecasts performed, looking at the availability among other measures. The availability is the forecast of the output the generator would produce if dispatched to run without limit.
The graphs below show the spread of difference across a month between the 24-hour-ahead forecast and the dispatch forecast, aggregating all units – from Appendix 16. The top graph in each pair below shows the range in MW, while the lower graph shows the relative size of the range adjusted for the capacity of generation.
For wind, the top pair of charts below, while the forecast difference range is increasing with time (as more capacity is installed), the relative difference is falling, showing some benefit of diversity between the generators. In the long‑term, our analysis of wind availability differences in the NEM suggests the magnitude of the 90% range is proportional to the square root of maximum capacity. Applying this relationship to future projections of wind capacity, we expect increases in capacity to result in weaker increases in aggregate forecast uncertainty.

In the solar charts below, the trend in the 90% difference range has increased in conjunction with increases in installed capacity across the NEM. Relative to maximum capacity, the 90% range remains steady.
This suggests that forecast availability differences among solar generators in the NEM may be more correlated than wind availability differences.
Note that the September 2021 point is anomalous due to constraints that limited inverter enablement at several farms being visible in the dispatch availability (the “actual” here) but not the pre-dispatch forecast availability figure, which while affecting our forecast evaluation here, would have had no practical impact on the accuracy of the pre-dispatch outcomes.

The charts above looked at day-ahead forecasting up to the last forecast of generator availability. The next question is whether the wind and solar farms delivered what was forecast.
One measure of this is “Raw Off-Target”, which we calculate as the dispatch target (what AEMO thinks the generator will do) compared to what it actually generated at the end of the dispatch interval – also taking into account any Regulation FCAS enablement allowances.
It’s expected that there will be some uncertainty in the output of wind and solar farms given the uncertain fuel inputs, and the NEM can manage small deviations through existing FCAS services, but larger deviations (especially above 300 MW) can be risky to power system security.
This chart below shows the aggregate off-target across semi-scheduled units (wind and solar farms that receive a dispatch instruction from AEMO), where a positive is under-generation and negative is over-generation – from Appendix 17. This is calculated in aggregate across all the semi-scheduled generators, so allows some over- and under-generation to cancel out. The darker colours indicate intervals where large deviations were seen.
In the last few years it’s clear that there are fewer intervals with very low off-target, and many more in the 100-200 MW range, plus increasing incidence of higher-deviation intervals.

Wind and solar generators are now able to provide their own self-forecast to AEMO for the dispatch (5-minute-ahead) forecast, instead of AEMO’s AWEFS/ASEFS forecast. The first self-forecast used in dispatch was Tailem Bend solar farm in September 2019.
The idea is that wind and solar farms have better information than AEMO on the local conditions and plant status and should be able to make better 5-minute-ahead predictions.
More accurate dispatch forecasts would improve the aggregate off-target numbers shown above. In GenInsights21 we looked at the uptake of self-forecasting across wind and solar farms, finding that as at the end of September 2021 around 50% of solar farms and 40% of wind farms were using self-forecasting – from Appendix 6.

With increasing incidence of negative pricing and constraints, wind and solar farms are needing to be more sophisticated in their bidding strategies.
In GenInsights21 we charted the number of rebids made by generation type, showing a large uptick in the number of rebids made by wind and solar in the last two years – from Appendix 22. Note that this is a log-scale chart!

We also tabulated our estimates from public data of which generators are using auto-bidders, and where we could tell, which auto-bidding supplier was used.
What is meant by 100% renewables? We have Appendix 26 in GenInsights21 that tries to untangle what’s meant by this – with one major distinction being between instantaneous or sustained 100% renewables.
In July 2021 AEMO’s new CEO Daniel Westerman talked about a 100% instantaneous renewables scenario by 2025.
GenInsights21 considered some of the major barriers, finding that there would likely at current installation rates be sufficient renewable capacity to meet this goal, in the right conditions (remember this is instantaneous, not sustained), but that getting the thermal units down to zero would be a much harder proposition.
Challenges to reach zero-thermal include the need for system security services such as inertia and system strength, the current low participation in FCAS provision by wind and solar, and the limited ramping capabilities of thermal plant (to come back up as the renewables came off).
Considering the concept of 100% sustained renewables (or somewhere near it), GenInsights21 Appendix 27  analyses historical wind speed data at hundreds of weather stations across the NEM to find the prevalence of “wind drought” periods, similar to June 2017 where some wind farms generated a third of their median generation for the month.
There were two other “droughts” identified in the past 15 years, in July 2006 and May 2010, where our estimated 30-day average capacity factor (for hypothetical wind farms) was similar to that of June 2017.

EDL chief executive officer James Harman said the town, which had previously been powered by diesel generators associated with the now defunct from the Ranger Uranium Mine, had been powered entirely by solar PV earlier this week as part of the final commissioning of the new hybrid power plant.
“The Jabiru Hybrid Renewable Power Station is now providing the town with stable, reliable energy that is at least 50% renewable over the long term, enabling the community to realise their vision of being an ecologically sustainable tourism and cultural hub for the region,” Harman said.
EDL will own and operate the new off-grid power system which comprises a 3.9 MW solar farm and a 3 MW/5 MWh battery energy storage system backed up by 4.5 MW of diesel-fired generators.
Chief Minister Michael Gunner labelled the commissioning of the power plant a “milestone” for the Territory.
“For the first time, Jabiru became the first town in the Territory to be powered by 100% solar for a day,” he said, adding the renewable energy power plant will provide Territorians will be able to “access better and more reliable services”.
Gunner said the new hybrid power station is part of a $135.5 million budget allocation to transition Jabiru from uranium-mine support community to Indigenous cultural hub and tourism centre.
“We are investing millions into Jabiru to transform it into the tourism and services hub we know it is well positioned to be,” he said.
Horizon Power
The 100% solar PV milestone follows a similar achievement in the Western Australian town of Onslow.
State-owned utility Horizon Power successfully powered the Pilbara community with renewable energy during a trial of the Onslow Distributed Energy Resource (DER) Project.
Horizon said electricity was powered by 600 KW of utility solar PV and 700 KW of rooftop solar, supported by battery technology.
For EDL, the Jabiru Hybrid Renewable Power Station builds on its success with the 56 MW Agnew Gold Mine microgrid project in Western Australia’s northern Goldfields region.
The Agnew microgrid integrates a 4 MW solar array, 18 MW wind farm and 13 MW/4 MWh battery energy storage system, backed by a 21 MW gas/diesel engine power plant.
EDL has also been contracted to build, own and operate a 4 MW solar plant and 4 MW/4 MWh battery energy storage system that will connect to the existing mini-grid at Weipa on Queensland’s Western Cape York Peninsula.
The new solar plant and battery storage system will complement the existing 1.7 MW solar farm and connect directly to the Weipa electricity network, helping provide reliable power for mining giant Rio Tinto’s Weipa bauxite mine and processing facilities as well as the surrounding community.
Construction of the project is expected to be complete by late 2022.

Chase published the prediction in an article surveying the current state of solar, and its future prospects, for sustainable energy journal Joule which was also published on the ScienceDirect website.
The article, View from the Solar Industry: We Don’t Need COP26 to Shine, But What Should We Worry About? included Bloomberg’s estimate for the volume of solar which will have been installed worldwide in 2030, with the analyst having estimated 183GW of photovoltaics were installed last year and this year will bring “comfortably more than 200GW.”
Chase cited the polysilicon shortage which drove up solar panel prices last year as one possible headwind, although the solar analyst expects the situation to ease with the arrival of new poly manufacturing capacity this year.
Shortages of land and grid connection points in some of the biggest solar markets could also pose problems for PV although Chase points out the industry’s biggest developers don’t seem to have been significantly slowed by those hurdles yet, with the solar expert adding: “Solar and wind deployment could not now be stopped if we wanted to.”
In terms of how much renewables are needed to hit a net zero world in mid century – with Chase remarking upon how much faster the scale of solar capacity is growing than that of wind – BloombergNEF’s renewables-focused “green” scenario would require 5.3TW of solar this decade – with 1TW of it to power green hydrogen production – and 19.7TW by 2050.
Alternative routes mapped by the analyst lean on the nuclear and carbon capture, use and storage technologies which, as yet, are not developing with sufficient speed, and Chase sounded a positive note to readers daunted by the scale of the job required by remarking, in relation to historic forecasts for clean energy roll-out: “As analysts, we are far better at seeing problems in each country than we are at imagining transformative change to world energy systems.”

Can you tell me about the Zinc Battery Initiative and why it was established?
The initiative is a consortium of battery companies and stakeholders that use zinc-based battery technology, as we realized it’s very important to have a common voice to represent this industry sector.
We have a very wide spectrum of members with different approaches and we believe it’s better to have a platform with different choices, almost like a menu, so you can best choose what suits your needs. And from what we hear, everybody wants safety and now, with supply chain issues and EVs being so successful, it’s not practical to rely solely on lithium.
What advantages do zinc batteries offer over other chemistries?
Zinc is very versatile and you can apply it to all kinds of applications and configurations, starting from very small formats. We just had a new member joining, Imprint Energy, which makes printed zinc batteries and they have found their niche in tracking sensors and the internet of things. Before zinc, they tried to use lithium-based technologies in a coin cell or other small formats but with lithium, there is so much packaging required to ensure safety. So, in the same volume, zinc-based technologies are almost 10 times better than lithium. Of course, in terms of energy density, lithium takes the win.
On the other end of the spectrum, if we look at large scale applications, there are zinc-flow batteries. One of our members, Australia-based Redflow, has just finished the installation of a 2MWh zinc-bromine system in California. We also have zinc-air flow batteries, such as the ones supplied by Canada’s Zinc8, where the size of your electrolyte tank determines the hours of storage. So you can go to 10 or 50 hours, even 100 hours of storage, but after that it makes sense to consider hydrogen.
These are the extreme ends, but there also is a lot in between. For instance, in data centers and server farms you need short-duration, reliable, instantaneous power, and this is where nickel-zinc excels. Two of our members, U.S.-based ZincFive and AEsir, are supplying this technology, and the latter one has recently secured financing for a gigawatt manufacturing facility in South Dakota. AEsir has … 30-year experience in zinc-based systems and is working on new cathodes they call rechargeable hybrid cathodes. They use lower cost components and circumvent nickel, the price of which has been rising.
What other configurations are there to see in the market?
There also are zinc batteries that are using low-cost, manganese-based cathodes. One of our other members, New York-based Urban Electric Power, is producing manganese-zinc batteries with an alkaline electrolyte and its focus is on residential storage. Also, we have two more members both looking at residential applications, Sweden-based Enerpoly and Canada-based Salient Energy, pursuing another way of doing manganese-zinc batteries. That is the newest approach in this chemistry, where manganese-dioxide is tweaked in a way that it works like a lithium-ion battery in mechanical terms and has zinc ions moving back and forth but with twice the charge than that of lithium. This tech can share production infrastructure with lithium-ion but it’s a water-based system, so there is no need for a dry room that lithium-ion batteries need as they don’t tolerate moisture.
Also, there are zinc-air batteries. Unlike flow batteries that require pumps and more moving parts, Canada-based e-Zinc has a system which uses a container that can be sized from two to 50 hours of storage. Their system is gravity based, with zinc generated in the upper section of the unit cell and moving to the lower section where it is used. We also have U.S.-based Enzinc among our members. They have commercialized a zinc sponge electrode and aim to get into the mobility market, to be used in e-bikes, golf carts or small-distance cars. In general, I think there’s great opportunity for zinc-based technology. We know it works but it just needs to be applied and deployed at scale.
And from all these configurations that you just mentioned, which one has gone the furthest in terms of the deployment?
Those would be nickel-zinc systems for data centers and transportation hubs. On the upper end, we have the zinc-flow systems and zinc-air systems which are in demonstration phases. Many of these systems still are not in the stage when you can just go and buy a unit, but we’ll get there.
So what does the future hold for zinc-based battery storage systems?
Right now, the market share of zinc-based technologies is very little but we think it will go to around 25% by 2050. So based on [the] BloombergNEF NEO 2020 [New Energy Outlook report] forecast for storage batteries, and [the] percentage of zinc market share estimates based on consultation with French company Avicenne Energy, the zinc energy storage market share is forecast to stand at 10% in 2030, 18% in 2040, [and] 25% in 2050.
Another interesting aspect in the supply chain [is that it] can be completely westernized. Zinc is globally mined and refined in 50 countries so supply is secure and conflict free.

The first nickel zinc batteries were invented by Thomas Edison but quickly fell out of favor. What has happened in the meantime that we are now seeing all these manufacturers emerging?
The fate of all batteries is determined by application. You have a need, and then you have a certain battery type to go with it. In the 90s, there was so much research going into lithium, and zinc-based batteries were considered an old technology. But now, 20 years later, things are different. We also are aware of the problems with lithium-ion batteries and researchers are thinking what other types of batteries can be made and what is needed. So they were looking at the drawbacks of the zinc-based battery systems, such as shape change and dendrite formation, and resolved these issues. It’s a very old technology but often companies decide to use their secret mixes and don’t give away all their ingredients. Of course the common goal is to control shape change so that you don’t lose energy over cycles, as well as to address forming of dendrites and thus prevent an early system failure. Those two issues were the reason behind the short life in zinc-based batteries but they have been resolved.
Can you say something about the technology’s technical aspects?
Zinc-based batteries have a wide operating temperature range [of] between -40 degrees Celsius to 75 degrees Celsius, depending on the application and recommendations of individual manufacturers. Overall, [the] life of the systems depends on the chemistry you use, for instance in flow batteries there is no degradation, so you’ll probably shoot for 20 years but of course you’ll need some maintenance. This is if you do accelerated testing, and we’ll know the real lifespan in 20 years, as the installations are just starting.
Charge cycles depend on which cathode you use and what your chemistry is. For example, zinc-ion can last as long as lithium-ion batteries. In manganese-zinc and alkaline configurations, the cycle life will mostly depend on how deep you discharge, similar to lead acid but still better performance. For zinc-flow it could be, even, up to 20,000 cycles. Depending on the zinc-based battery technology applied, the energy density can be similar to lead acid batteries and can go from 70-150Wh/kg. With zinc-air systems, which has theoretical energy densities in excess of 1,000Wh/kg, higher values may be attainable
Where do the zinc batteries fall in with all the other available chemistries on the market and what are their best applications?
Nickel-zinc batteries are a great fit for data centers and server farms where, still, mainly lead acid batteries are being used today, as well as for military applications such as submarines. Then, manganese-zinc systems will be used in applications where two to six hours of storage is needed. As we go along with demonstrations and the need for longer-duration storage grows, we will eventually have zinc-based batteries providing baseload power in combination with renewable energy sources.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/11/latent-heat-thermal-storage-with-pv-for-nearly-zero-energy-buildings/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 11, 2022",Latent heat thermal storage with PV for nearly zero-energy buildings,"Researchers at Politecnico di Torino in Italy are testing how latent heat thermal storage (LHTS) could be used in combination with rooftop PV to achieve nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEB). NZEBS are residential and commercial buildings that have very low primary energy requirements, which have to be met to a significant extent by renewable sources.
“In the European project RE-cognition, we are using LHTS and PV independently of each other to meet the electrical and thermal demand of our pilot building – the Energy Center at our campus,” researcher Giulia Manco told pv magazine. “In general, however, it would be possible to couple photovoltaics to this type of heat storage if you had a heat pump capable of converting the electricity produced by photovoltaics into thermal energy.”
He said the configuration would facilitate the accumulation of surplus electricity from photovoltaics in the form of heat, thus increasing the self-consumption of renewable energy.
“A heat pump is currently not included in this specific project,” said researcher Alessandro Colangelo. “Therefore, the LHTS will allow increasing the flexibility of the thermal demand of the pilot building, while photovoltaics will increase the share of renewable electricity consumed on site.”
The 47kW PV system consists of a southwest-oriented solar array on the rooftop and several southeast-oriented PV panels integrated into the hall windows. The pilot building also has other renewable energy technologies such a geothermal heat pump, a district heating substation, and two small experimental wind turbines.
The latent heat thermal storage system is described by the scientists as able to accumulate significant amounts of thermal energy to use when heating is needed. The system is based on a special kind of phase change material (PCM) related to bio-based paraffin, with a melting point at 74 C.
PCMs are substances that absorb and release heat energy when they change phase and are able to store and release large amounts of latent heat over a defined temperature range. In the construction business, combining building materials with PCMs is an efficient way to improve the thermal energy storage capacity of construction elements. The cost of PCM is strongly dependent on the type of material.
“Organic PCMs are the easiest to use and cost between 2-10 €/kg,” Manco said. “The specific energy content is also rather variable, but approximately organic PCMs are able to store 200 kJ/kg”
The LHTS  appear as a tank filled with the PCM, crossed by several pipes where the water of the heating system is flowing.
“To enhance the rate of the heat exchange between the water and the PCM, extensions made of high conductive material are added to the pipes, thus facilitating the charging and discharging processes,” the research group explained.
In the charging phase, the initially solid PCM melts gradually, heat is stored and hot water can be supplied through the pipes. In the discharging process, the initially liquid PCM solidifies when heat is released and cold water can be supplied through the same pipes.
“The energy required for these transformations is very high since the molecular structure of the PCM is modified. Hence, a large amount of heat can be accumulated in a relatively small volume, up to five times lower than a traditional water tank,” the academics said.
The proposed system was built with two tanks that can store up to 40kWh of thermal energy each and different internal pipe extensions.
“Following a topological optimization approach in the design phase, the same quantity of high conductive material was arranged differently around the tubes to increase the LHTS performance,” the scientists said.
The two storage tanks can purportedly release most of their energy content in less than one hour. Experimental tests are currently being made by the group, which said the real potential of this technology should be well known by this spring.
“It would be immediately transferable to commercial production and there is already a start-up here in Turin working on this type of devices,” Colantuono said.
