Construction of the Townsville green hydrogen hub, which will co-locate producers and users of hydrogen, is due to start next year and be complete in 2026, with commercial operations scheduled to start in 2027.
Edify and its partners will deliver a 17.6 MW demonstration production facility with integrated renewable energy generation and battery storage.
The initial stage of the hub will support the production of 800 tonnes of green hydrogen per year, before ramping up to about 3,000 tonnes per annum for domestic supply with a view to scaling up production to 150,000 tonnes per year for export.
Sydney-based Edify has already been granted development approval to build and operate a green hydrogen production plant of up to 1 GW, as well as a behind-the-meter solar and battery storage facility within the Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct, about 50 kilometres south of Townsville.
Australian Energy Minister Chris Bowen said renewable hydrogen shapes as a “game changer” for the country’s economy, opening the door to green metals, green fertiliser, green power and supporting industrial decarbonisation.
Bowen said the Townsville region is perfectly positioned to take advantage of the growing global demand with its infrastructure, workforce capacity, and proximity to Asian trading partners making it an ideal location for a green hydrogen hub.
“With its port, expertise in exports and access to Queensland’s abundant solar resources, Townsville is ideally placed to help power the world with Australian renewable energy and create jobs in regional Australia,” he said.
The Townsville hydrogen hub has attracted more than $137 million of combined investment, including $20.7 million from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA). Funding is also being sourced from industry and the German government.
The Australian government’s contribution is part of more $500 million in Commonwealth funding for hydrogen hubs in regional centres including Gladstone, Bell Bay, Kwinana, the Pilbara, Port Bonython and the Hunter.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the investment will help unlock the benefits of an industry which could inject an additional $50 billion into the Australian economy by 2050.
Albanese said the global shift to clean energy and decarbonised economies presents a huge economic opportunity but warned the competition to secure a share of the market is hotting up.
“We need to recognise that globally there is competition, there’s a race on for who can position themselves to take advantage of the shift that is occurring globally,” he said, adding that he is “determined to grasp this opportunity.”
The Townsville announcement was welcomed by Zero Carbon Hydrogen Australia General Manager Joanna Kay who said it solidifies a promising beginning for Australia’s hydrogen industry in 2024.
“Hydrogen hubs hold the potential to boost local economies, creating jobs and reducing carbon emissions in industries still tethered to fossil fuel energy,” she said.
“However, it’s crucial to note that … to truly thrive, hydrogen hubs must actively build community support, emphasising the broader benefits they bring to the table.”
The federal government has estimated that the Townsville hydrogen hub will create 200 direct jobs, as well as 300 ongoing jobs.

Isaac Regional Council approved Iberdrola’s request to develop the temporary accommodation on condition of compliance with general, environmental, and hazard-reduction conditions. These include a requirement to submit a rehabilitation and decommissioning plan one year prior to the closure of the site and that the accommodation will be removed completely within three years following its commencement of use.
The Broadsound Solar Farm, first announced in 2022, is currently in the planning with construction expected to begin in 2025.
Being developed on a 3,600-hectare former cattle station near Clarke Creek, about 160 kilometres northwest of Rockhampton, the project will comprise approximately 645,000 solar modules and once operational will be capable of producing 392 MW of power for about 140,000 homes.
The facility will connect to the National Electricity Network (NEM) via Powerlink’s existing 275 kV Broadsound substation.
The Broadsound project is part of Iberdrola’s increasing focus on the Australian market with the Spanish company having committed to investing more than $4 billion (USD 2.64 billion) to grow its renewable energy capacity to 4 GW in Australia.
The company, which entered the Australian market in 2020 with the acquisition of Infigen Energy, has approximately 2 GW of renewable projects in its Australian operational and in-development portfolio and expects to add 2 GW more in the coming years.
Iberdrola has also established a networks business to be involved in Australia’s transmission infrastructure and meet demand for expanding solar resources and transport power to coastal population centres.
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland last week, Iberdrola Executive Chairman Ignacio Galan said the growth of green energy is expected to accelerate in Australia over the next 10 years.
He advocated for increased investment in, and faster development of, electricity distribution networks and storage including batteries and pumped hydro.
Galan said the technology, finance resources and ambition already exist to accelerate developments, but he stressed the importance of involving local communities in promoting renewable installations.
“I have 25 years of experience,” he said. “I grew up in a village; I know countryside people, and big companies must get involved with local communities, and agreements must be reached with local communities before starting anything and communities must see an opportunity not in electricity production but in creating a new economy around it.”
The Broadsound project is being built across the road from Squadron Energy’s Clarke Creek wind and solar farm that is to include up to 400 MW of PV and an 800 MW wind farm that is currently under construction.

Origin Chief Executive Officer Frank Calabria said the Mortlake Power Station battery is another “significant step” in the company’s ambition to lead the energy transition through cleaner energy and customer solutions.
The company’s aim is to grow renewables and storage capacity within its portfolio to 4 GW by 2030.
“Origin’s strategy is to accelerate renewable energy and storage in our portfolio and we expect large-scale batteries and other storage technologies to play a vital role in Australia’s energy transition,” he said.
The approval for the Mortlake battery comes after Origin last year pressed go on its first large-scale battery project, approving the 700 MW/2,800 MWh battery planned for the Eraring site in the New South Wales (NSW) Hunter Valley. Construction of the first 460 MW stage of the Eraring battery has already commenced.
Calabria said the proposed Mortlake battery energy storage system, located in Victoria’s South West Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), will provide system strength to the National Electricity Market (NEM), capturing excess power during periods of high renewable generation and discharging to meet peak demand.
“With the proliferation of wind and solar farms, particularly in Victoria’s South West REZ, the Mortlake battery will help keep the grid stable and support more renewable energy coming into the system as the market continues to decarbonise,” he said.
The project will also contribute to Victoria’s drive to meet legislated energy storge targets of at least 2.6 GW of storage capacity by 2030 and 6.3 GW by 2035, when it aims to reach 95% renewable share.
Calabria said contracts have been signed with global energy storage systems supplier Fluence for the supply of the 300 MW battery energy storage system.
The project will use Fluence’s modular Gridstack energy storage product backed by a 15-year service agreement. The system will also utilise Fluence’s AI-powered asset performance management software, Nispera, to optimise the battery’s operational performance.
Origin said site preparation and civil works are expected to commence over coming months with the battery expected to be commissioned in the final quarter of 2026.

Steve Ruskin, vice president of sales at FranklinWH Australia, said the dual approvals pave the way for the company to roll out its Franklin Whole Home (WH) energy management system in Victoria and South Australia and positions the company as a key player in the Australia’s clean energy transition.
“This is a significant step towards realising our vision of making sustainable energy solutions accessible to a broader audience,” he said.
Ruskin said the FranklinWH home energy system improves the efficiency of residential solar installations by better integrating them with the rest of the home’s energy supply and by storing excess solar production to be used when the sun isn’t shining.
The energy storage solution, which is manufactured in China, integrates a 5 kW / 13.6 kWh lithium iron phosphate ‘aPower’ battery with adaptive learning, which is part of the included ‘aGate’ smart control system that integrates solar, batteries, grid, and generator power sources and manages them to optimise consistent energy supply.
The company said the battery is compatible with any PV inverter technology, and it can connect with existing solar systems while scaling up to 15 units for a total of 204 kWh of capacity. In the event of a power failure, its “black start” feature creates a micro-grid for the home.
The system comes EV charger ready and is designed to turn a home into a microgrid when the grid is down.
The inclusion of FranklinWH’s energy management system on the SAPN and Solar Victoria battery product lists comes after the Clean Energy Council (CEC) listed it in its Battery Assurance Program.
The CEC said the products included on the list have been independently tested and have been approved to meet the necessary electrical safety and quality standards of the program.

Germany’s AEG has launched a new n-type solar module based on all-back contact (ABC) cell technology.
“Everything electric happens behind the curtains: the contacts are placed on the back of the module, thus allowing a ‘gridless’ effect,” Conny Axel Hulverscheidt, the CTO of AGE’s Solar Solutions Group, told pv magazine, referring to the cell design. “Not only does this allow a larger active area on the module surface to convert sunlight to electricity, it also ensures an absolute sleek black look. Furthermore, the low-temperature coefficients and the robust dual glass design make this solar module a real flagship product.”
The AS-M1089B-GA(M10)/HV solar panel is currently available in three versions with a power output of 445 W to 455 W. Power conversion efficiencies range from 22.8% to 23,3%, while the open-circuit voltage is between 40.15 V and 40.35 V and the short-circuit current spans from 13.68 A to 13.80 A.
The panel is based on M10 wafers, measures 1,722 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm, and weighs in at 24.0 kg. It relies on 2.0 mm glass, a black frame made of anodized aluminum alloy, and an IP68 rating. It can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and temperatures ranging from -40 C to 85 C. It features a temperature coefficient of -0.29% per degree Celsius.
AEG offers a 40-year product warranty and a 40-year power output guarantee. The 40-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 83.4% of the nominal output power.
“To underline the premium approach, this module design gives us the confidence to offer market-leading warranties of up to 40 years,” Hulverscheidt stated. “The series will soon also include a 460 W version and will be available in two variants: a glass-glass product and a glass-backsheet module. Both panels with have a 108-cell design.”
