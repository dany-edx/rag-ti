https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/23/sa-labor-unveils-590-million-green-hydrogen-initiative/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 23, 2021",SA Labor unveils $590 million green hydrogen initiative,"On the same day the State Government announced it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to study the feasibility of exporting green hydrogen to Europe’s largest port, the South Australian Opposition unveiled its Hydrogen Jobs Plan, outlining its strategy to establish a “world-leading” hydrogen industry, including one of the world’s largest hydrogen electrolyser facilities by 2025.
South Australian Opposition leader Peter Malinauskas said a Labor government would build 250 MWe of hydrogen electrolysers, a 200 MW hydrogen-fuelled power station and storage capacity capable of holding 3600 tonnes of hydrogen, or the equivalent of two months of hydrogen power generation.
The plan also calls for the creation of government-owned entity Hydrogen Power SA which would own and operate the hydrogen production and power plant.
“As we move into the post-COVID recovery phase, South Australia needs a vision which will set our state up for the future,” Malinauskas said.
“Hydrogen is central to the world’s energy future – it’s cleaner, it’s cheaper and South Australia is uniquely positioned to become a world leader, with our abundant wind and solar resources.”
Malinauskas said building a 200 MW hydrogen-fuelled power station would provide firming capacity in the South Australian Electricity Market.
He said the electrolysers would use excess renewable energy to produce hydrogen, reducing the need to remotely switch off rooftop solar for households and businesses, and would help unlock a $20 billion pipeline of renewable energy projects in the state.
“South Australia has a proud legacy of leading Australia and the world on renewable energy and this is our next leap forward,” he said.
“We have all the ingredients; we just need a vision.”
Labor said the Hydrogen Jobs Plan will deliver cheaper power to industry and businesses, pointing to an independent analysis by Frontier Economics which indicates South Australia’s hydrogen plant will reduce the wholesale cost of electricity to industry by 8%.
Labor said if elected, all elements of the Hydrogen Jobs Plan will be operational by the end of 2025.
Shadow Minister for Energy Tom Koutsantonis said the cheap production of hydrogen would be a “gamechanger”.
“Its uses are diverse, including manufacturing, firming energy to lower electricity prices, manufacturing green steel, being injected directly into furnaces to offset coal use and use in heavy vehicle and passenger vehicles to lower emissions and lower costs,” he said.
“We are going to be at the forefront of this because this is where the jobs are, and this is where the future is.”
Labor’s plan also aims to take advantage of emerging international markets with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) forecasting the hydrogen export industry will be worth $1.7bn to the Australian economy by 2030.

The current South Australian Government is already exploring hydrogen export opportunities, announcing on Tuesday it had signed an MoU to study the feasibility of exporting green hydrogen to Rotterdam, Europe’s largest port.
The Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands is at the vanguard in the transition to renewable energy and has developed an ambitious masterplan to become a major hydrogen import hub to supply north-west Europe with renewable energy.
Rotterdam currently imports vast quantities of oil and coal but hydrogen is expected to replace these to a large extent in the years to come, as part of the decarbonization of the European economy.
SA Minister for Energy and Mining Dan van Holst Pellekaan said Europe is set to remain a net importer of energy and its “gradual shift from grey to green” will pave the way for South Australia to establish itself as a world-class renewable hydrogen supplier.
“The South Australian Government intends to become a national and international exporter of clean power, through new power interconnectors and carriers such as hydrogen,” van Holst Pellekaan said.
“These could lead to South Australia producing around 500% of its current grid demand in renewable energy by 2050.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/23/agl-pushes-ahead-with-plans-for-200-mw-big-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 23, 2021",AGL pushes ahead with plans for 200 MW big battery,"AGL confirmed on Tuesday it had lodged an application with the Victorian Minister for Planning and the Department of Environment, Water, Land and Planning for a 200 MW, four-hour duration grid-scale battery to be built adjacent to the brown coal-fuelled Loy Yang Power Station.
The energy giant has previously declared its aim to add at least 850 MW of new large-scale battery storage to its portfolio by the end of 2024 and said the Loy Yang project is part of the company’s energy transition.
AGL chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said batteries will be an important part of the technology mix needed to deliver Australia’s energy needs in the decades ahead.
“This project will play a critical role in transforming the reliability of renewables in Victoria, providing essential firming capacity and storage,” he said.
“With the commissioning of Loy Yang A in 1985, the Latrobe Valley has a long and proud of history of generating electricity to thousands of Australian households and businesses.
“The region will continue to play an important role in providing reliable and affordable energy, this project is part of both the AGL and the region’s transition and path to a lower emissions future.”
AGL has already laid out plans for the deployment of about 1.2 GW of utility-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) across multiple locations, including a 250 MW, four-hour-duration battery system to be built at the site of its Torrens Island power station in South Australia.

The company has plans to build utility-scale batteries at its Liddell power station (150MW) and at Broken Hill (50MW) in New South Wales and has announced support for battery projects at Wandoan (100 MW) in Queensland and Maoneng (4 x 50 MW) in NSW. It is already operating the 30 MW/ 8 MWh BESS at Dalrymple in South Australia.
The energy provider as also signed non-exclusive framework agreements with energy storage technology companies Fluence and Wärtsilä to supply up to 1 GW of large-scale battery storage.
AGL, which earlier this year was branded the nation’s biggest polluter, emitting more than 42 million tonnes of carbon emissions in 2020, has promised to transition to “full decarbonisation”  by 2050 and said batteries would be crucial in that process.
“It is through low-emission firming technologies like batteries that we can create sustainable energy for our customers as well as deliver on our Climate Statement commitments which include net-zero emissions by 2050,” Brokhof said.
AGL is one of a number of gen-tailers, developers, network owners and service providers to announce new battery projects in recent months as the search for essential stabilising services to the grid ramps up as coal-fired generators are retired.
EnergyAustralia earlier this month announced it would replace its Yallourn coal-fired power station in the Latrobe Valley with a four-hour 350 MW capacity big battery.
Others who have joined the big battery race include French renewables developer Neoen, which announced in January plans for a 500 MW / 1000 MWh big battery to be built west of Sydney, while later that month Origin Energy announced it would build a 700 MW mega-battery with a dispatch duration of four hours at the site of its ageing Eraring Power Station in the NSW Hunter region.

UPC\AC Renewables CEO Anton Rohner said work has already started on stage one of the 720 MW solar farm which will be coupled with a 400 MWh Battery Energy Storage System (BESS).
“It is exciting to reach this milestone,” he said. “UPC\AC Renewables Australia first walked these lands with the farmers three-and-a-half years ago and today we’re starting construction on one of the southern hemisphere’s largest solar farms.”
The New England Solar Farm will comprise more than 2.4 million solar panels, 150 power conversion units, and a lithium-ion battery storage facility. It will connect to TransGrid’s existing 330 kV transmission line that crosses the 3,362-hectare development site.
The solar farm will be installed in two stages. Stage one includes a 400 MW solar farm comprising about 980,000 PV modules mounted onto a horizontal single-axis tracking system.
The first stage will also include 50 MWh of integrated battery storage and a 33/330kV substation.
The first stage is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2023 with the company hopeful it will be able to commence construction on the second stage prior to then.

Once fully operational, the facility is expected to produce 1,800 GWh of electricity annually, enough to power more than 250,000 homes.
“Once fully complete, the solar farm and battery project will be Australia’s largest hybrid solar and battery energy storage facility. It will play an important role in the energy transition already underway across the country,” Rohner said.
“The local community, our project landowners and civic leaders have been very supportive of the project over the past three years. We’re extremely excited to see construction start and the opportunities that are being returned and created for local business and workers.”
The project will help build out the New England REZ, one of five renewable energy zones included in the NSW Government’s electricity “road map“, which is designed to support more than $32 billion of investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission in the state.
Elecnor Australia has been awarded the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for the first stage of the project. The Spanish-owned renewable energy group will perform the job through its Green Light Contractors subsidiary.
Elecnor will also be responsible for operation and maintenance in the two years following start-up.
Initial works will include upgrades for the local road network connecting to the New England Solar Farm site.
UPC\AC Australia, a joint venture between UPC Renewables and AC Energy, a subsidiary of Ayala Corporation in the Philippines, said up to 700 jobs are expected to be created from the solar farm and battery project during peak construction.

The Element e-bus, which will run between the Sydney beachside suburbs of Bondi and Bronte during the two-week trial, was designed and built by Sydney-based bus and coach manufacturer Custom Denning.
“Until now we’ve seen the conversion of diesel buses to electric and buses built overseas, but this is the first fully fledged Australian-made bus in the state,” Transport Minister Andrew Constance said.
“The state’s first trial of a locally built electric bus takes us closer to an emissions free future.”
The state’s 8,000 buses currently operate on diesel fuel and compressed natural gas but there are plans to roll out 50 new e-buses across Sydney this year with the government aiming to replace the entire fleet by 2030, in line with its net zero by 2050 plan.
“I want to scale up our efforts towards tackling climate change,” Constance said.
“Over the last 18 months we’ve been trialling five electric buses in the Inner West, and the feedback from drivers and customers has been positive.”
Custom Denning managing director Scott Dunn welcomed the trial and government support.
“The NSW Government has supported our business since I purchased it three years ago, now we can help them build a better future for both commuters and the environment,” he said.

The Element e-bus features recyclable Lithium Metal Polymer (LMP) Solid State batteries which come with a 10-year warranty.
Custom Denning said the Element bus can operate for approximately 16 hours or 450kms on a full charge, which takes about five hours to deliver.
The Element is the latest in the rollout of electric buses on NSW roads with a new BCI-manufactured e-bus taking to the roads in Sydney’s south west last month.
BCI said the bus is capable of running for up to seven hours on a full charge.
As part of the 2021 rollout, another nine electric buses, are due to be delivered by the end of the year while a further 70 are on order from Truegreen’s Nexport, which is establishing a manufacturing facility in the southern Highlands.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/23/stanwell-signs-up-to-600-million-solar-thermal-plan-for-mt-isa/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 23, 2021",Stanwell signs up to $600 million solar thermal plan for Mt Isa,"Sydney-based Vast Solar is looking to develop a $600 million hybrid power plant in Mount Isa combining solar PV, a large-scale battery and gas engines with a 50 MW solar thermal facility powered by the company’s proprietary technology.
Energy giant Stanwell announced on Monday it had signed a joint development agreement with Vast Solar. Stanwell will initially provide $5 million towards a feasibility study, with Vast Solar also providing $5 million.
Vast Solar unveiled plans for the North West Queensland Hybrid Power Plant last year. The project will integrate solar PV, battery storage and gas engines with Vast Solar’s own concentrated solar thermal (CSP) power technology, using mirrors and receiving towers to gather and store the sun’s energy.
Unlike traditional CSP technology that uses molten salt both as a heat transfer and for storage, Vast Solar has developed low cost, modular, technology with integrated thermal storage that uses sodium for heat transfer and molten salt for on-demand storage, both of which create steam to drive a turbine.
The technology has been trialled at Vast Solar’s 1 MW pilot plant, which has been delivering electricity to the grid since early 2018, and the company claims it allows plants to be configured with 4-16 hours of storage and generators of up to 500 MW.
Vast Solar said 85% of the output at the North West Queensland Hybrid Power Project would be zero carbon, with the rest generated from gas, and the project would deliver cheaper energy than alternative baseload generation options over its 30-year life.
The feasibility study, which will examine logistical details, planning requirements and financing, is expected to be completed later this year, with approvals expected early in 2022, followed by two years of construction. Early generation would start in 2023 due to a staggered build plan.
Stanwell CEO Richard Van Breda said projects such as the North West Queensland Hybrid Power Project “are integral to the development and diversification of our energy portfolio around the state”.
“This project illustrates our values by delivering a better Queensland through transitioning to a lower carbon future while still contributing to the economy, creating jobs and delivering low-cost energy to homes and businesses,” he said.
Stanwell was the original generator of power in Mount Isa before it shut its 218 MW Mica Creek Power Station at the end of 2020.
That has left the APA Group with its gas power stations the dominant generator in the region, which is not connected to the National Energy Market (NEM).
The region is however set to be linked to the NEM with state and federal governments fast-tracking support for the massive CopperString 2.0 high voltage transmission line connecting Mount Isa with Townsville.
Construction is yet to begin on the $1.5 billion transmission link but earlier this month CIMIC Group’s UGL and CPB Contractors announced they had signed early-stage contracts to construct the 1,100km high-voltage transmission line.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/23/down-55-but-not-out/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",,"MARCH 23, 2021",Down 55% – but not out,"From Watt Clarity,
It would be easy to start apportioning “blame” for this near-miss event to a whole raft of factors – the shouting match over the recent unmitigated disaster in Texas provides a sorry template for that – but I think it’s more useful to start by looking at themes that might emerge from events like this one.
I’ll then examine a few micro-details of what must have been a white-knuckle ride for AEMO, AGL, and South Australian transmission operator ElectraNet, evident in the detailed market data.
While there’s a lot of understandable interest in the granular detail of Friday evening’s events, too much focus on that risks missing some larger themes brought home by this and other notable events that have affected the NEM (mostly South Australia) in the last five years:
And that’s not an exhaustive list.
I’ve picked out three themes for discussion here.
Power system reliability draws a lot of focus, hundreds of pages of dense reports, and terabytes of modelling data, but is fundamentally a pretty narrowly defined statistical process for quantifying the chances of having enough supply to continuously meet demand, and the extent of any deficits. It’s all based on modelling of “mathematically expected” probabilities of failure etc.
Power system resilience is a much more loosely framed topic dealing with the ability of a system to manage through unexpected disruptions and shocks. So far it hasn’t garnered nearly as many pages or terabytes, but I suspect it’s more likely to keep system operators awake at night.
A feature of all but one of the events listed above is that parts of the power system were hit by multiple contingencies that took out significantly more supply capability in one hit than registers in any traditional reliability (or system security) analysis – or if it does register, only at such low probability levels that it’s essentially ignored in the formal reliability metrics like “expected unserved energy” or “loss of load probability”.
Another feature of some events was the extended nature of the triggering contingency and ensuing disruptions.
Texas provides an even starker illustration of the difference between reliability and resilience, if one was needed.
The kinds of event relevant to a resilience analysis are – almost by definition – those that fall beyond the statistical reach of reliability modelling, but as these real world examples show they seem to happen often enough. It’s just that we don’t yet seem to have good ways of characterizing and planning for them, in a generalized sense.
It’s more than high time we developed some! Paul has made a similar specific suggestion in regard to AEMO’s next ESOO.
 
This one is more specific, but has become a personal bugbear of mine.
Low output from renewables in South Australia last Friday evening was not a direct cause of the supply “crisis”. We should henceforth cancel any discussion and comparison of the capability or “performance” of fundamentally different supply sources that simply uses megawatts as a measuring stick.
OK that’s a bit extreme, but frankly, talking about “poor performance” or “unreliability” of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources like solar and wind generation in some system event, using short term megawatt output relative to nominal megawatt capacity (aka short term capacity factor), almost completely misses the point.
Equally missing the point is to discuss “replacement” of the retiring 1,400 MW Yallourn Power Station in Victoria with X thousand megawatts of VRE generation, whatever the value of X.
The point is that VRE generation is variable and we’ve known that forever. So we shouldn’t pretend for an instant that it’s surprising or unacceptable that VRE produces very little output when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing. Nor should we pretend that any number of VRE megawatts is somehow a like for like substitute for dispatchable capacity.
Regarding VRE “performance”, pointing the finger at South Australia’s renewables for producing at only (say) 2% of nominal capacity late on a calm evening makes about as much sense as castigating householders for all turning on their air conditioners when the temperature reaches 40 degrees. It’s an entirely expected outcome in both cases; of course balancing supply and demand would be easier if things were different, but atmospheric physics and human behaviour being what they are, these are just phenomena that need to be planned for and accommodated.
More than a few commentators, on discovering that VRE generation is – shock, horror – variable, next leap to a conclusion that it must be completely useless. These commentators evidently don’t get the distinction between capacity (megawatts) and energy (megawatt hours), nor do they understand generation economics.
Traditional dispatchable generation sources deliver both capacity and energy, at a cost, with a relatively predictable (“firm”) profile; VRE sources essentially deliver energy, at an increasingly lower cost, but with a stochastic capacity profile that has to be “managed around” – just like variable demand with all those annoying consumers turning on air conditioners also has to be “managed around”. Providing dispatchable capacity to complement the stochastic profiles of VRE and demand is one of the costs of this “managing around”. So are any measures increasingly required to deal with potentially excessive VRE output and low demand.
If the cost of VRE is low enough that after adding these “managing around” costs it’s still the cheapest source of system energy, then build more of it (when needed).
If the total of the VRE energy costs and the “managing around” costs becomes excessive, that’s the time to think about changing strategy.
Most of the time, the popular discussion of all this never gets to the economics – despite, for example, the earnest efforts of AEMO in its ISP – and instead gets hung up on arguments that “my megawatts are better / greener / cleaner / firmer than yours”.
We could even extend this discussion to comparisons between “dispatchable” megawatts at offline slow-start plant – clearly not of any use in a sudden supply shortfall like last Friday – versus dispatchable megawatts at batteries – good in short bursts – versus dispatchable megawatts at fast-start hydro or thermal plant. They’re all different, depending on circumstances.
{/rant}
 
Another characteristic shared by most of the events I listed earlier is that transmission limitations and / or exposure of the transmission system to environmental risks played a very significant role.
This is really one specific domain of the wider reliability vs resilience space, but it’s very important in the NEM because relative to the electrical size of the system, it’s a very long and stringy transmission grid with relatively low redundancy compared to the more typical strongly meshed grids in densely populated regions of the world.
And although transmission equipment is inherently pretty reliable, it’s unavoidably exposed to the elements, and also requires regular maintenance that can further reduce redundancy and cause significant, albeit temporary, capacity reductions. Just like we saw last Friday.
Building more of it to more tightly integrate the NEM should on the face of things improve reliability and resilience, but careful attention will need to be given to avoiding unintended consequences – a region which becomes more reliant on energy flows across lengthy interconnections which remain exposed to multiple failure modes and risk factors may not end up with much higher resilience.
I haven’t seen firm evidence one way or the other (and any assessment would need a hypothetical counterfactual), but I do wonder how much resilience – as opposed to lower average energy costs – South Australia has gained with the significant upgrade in capacity on the interconnection via Heywood in recent years. The flip side of this increased capacity may have been larger disruptions in that capacity when failures or maintenance occur (perhaps in conjunction with other events, such as last Friday’s), with at least the possibility of poorer overall resilience outcomes.
 
As Paul has already produced a very detailed timeline of events, and I’m time-limited for this analysis, I’ll just pick out three details relying on some further market data mostly not available at the time of his write-up.
Without going into the schematics of the Torrens Island switchyard, my understanding is that the failure that forced off AGL’s Barker Inlet plant took out one of the two high voltage buses that also connect Torrens Island B, leaving its three units online at the time (B2, B3 and B4) more exposed to a consequential risk of tripping. Also in the aftermath of the incident, it was apparently unclear that these units would be able to remain online while damage to the switchyard was being assessed.
This led to a constraint on TIPS B that initially limited output to 270 MW (out of 800 MW registered capacity), and then from DI 19:20 (two hours after the initial incident) additional constraints and rebids that should prima facie have taken TIPS B3 and B4 offline, leaving just 60 MW running at TIPS B2. However for reasons that are not clear, TIPS B3 and B4 remained online each at a minimum load of 40 MW for a period of over an hour despite market dispatch targets to go offline. This is all summarized in the chart below:

A possible reason for TIPS B3 and B4 not following dispatch targets, and their owner’s own declared zero availability, from around DI 19:30 is that at this point there was virtually no spare dispatchable capacity remaining in South Australia, interconnector flows were at limit (reduced by the transmission work in Victoria), and removing another 80 MW of supply might have been the “straw that broke the camel’s back” and led to forced load shedding. This is speculation, but I have no doubt there were intense discussions at this time between AEMO, ElectraNet and AGL, and it’s just possible that AGL was asked to hold off tripping its two B units while the situation was assessed, and while a second gas turbine at Engie’s Pelican Point power station was in the process of starting up.
Whilst the above situation was evolving at Torrens Island B, the overall supply position began easing from DI 20:05 when Pelican Point synchronised its second gas turbine – whose capacity had been bid unavailable for some days prior to the event.
Rebid volumes and reasons for Pelican Point appear to indicate that this second unit was only started in response to a direction from AEMO, issued some time before 19:05 NEM time (actual time of issue is not visible in public market data, we just have to infer from things like rebid reasons and times). Presumably this is the direction referred to in a slightly later public market notice from AEMO:

The impact of the direction on Pelican Point’s offered capacity is summarised in the following panel of four rebids received by AEMO between 18:46 and 20:17 NEM time:

The additional 100 – 170 MW of capacity made available from DI 20:05 by this direction, together with TIPS B3 and B4 staying online, were clearly vitally important factors in maintaining uninterrupted supply over the critical period between DI 19:25 and DI 20:10, during which the spot price sat continuously between $11,000/MWh and $15,000/MWh.
 
Once Pelican Point’s second GT had started and the question of keeping Torrens Island online was resolved, it might have seemed that the worst of the supply crisis was over by around 21:00 NEM time. But then another extended period of price volatility emerged between DIs 22:35 and 23:35.
 

It seems that the driver for this was probably an outage-related  system strength constraint centered on generation in the south-east of South Australia and south-west Victoria that effectively forced flows out of South Australia once Mortlake Power Station went offline at 22:30. Mortlake is the predominant source of system strength in this region, and when offline (and when there is a single-contingency risk of the region becoming isolated from the rest of Victoria, as there was due to the transmission line work in progress), the constraint “V_MLMO_VS_LB_CAN_50” – what’s in a name eh? – became binding and limited total westward flows from this region into the rest of South Australia to 50 MW (see the constraint description below).

With local generation (predominantly at Ladbroke Grove) higher than this 50 MW figure, the only way for the excess to flow was out of South Australia, shown on the following chart.

This effectively reduced available supply into South Australia by over 200 MW, and likely accounted for the final period of volatility on a night that had already proved quite difficult enough.

The report shows solid progress in some quarters, but a long way to go if we are to reach the 700% renewables by 2050 needed for superpower status. 
On the surface, the scorecard reveals little that we don’t know, Australia’s states are leading the race to become renewable superpowers and the federal government’s policies are lagging behind. 
The scorecard ranks the progress of various Australian governments based on three measures of renewable ‘superpowerdom’, namely, cleaning up the electricity system, electrifying transport, buildings and industry, and exporting renewables and renewable-powered products to the world.
The scorecard 
Across these metrics Tasmania has made a break from the peloton of other states with South Australia (SA) close behind and New South Wales (NSW) along with Victoria (VIC) in hot pursuit. Tasmania has already achieved 100% renewables, is legislating the largest renewable energy target in the world, and is ambitious in its progress toward green hydrogen production. 
South Australia’s 500% renewables aspiration puts it in clear second-place, further propelled by its early adoption of utility-scale energy storage and grid balancing. 
WWF-Australia has NSW and VIC tied in third place with the federal government lagging all the way back in seventh. and as Nicky Ison, WWF-Australia’s energy transition manager made clear, Australia is extraordinarily blessed with the renewable resources that will power the world in this century and centuries to come, and the federal government’s sluggardly pace is not requisite to our “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to harness this potential to create jobs and wealth for all Australians long into the future.” 

“The federal government should be the primary agents selling our renewable energy to the world,” continued Ison, “but our analysis shows the states are currently doing the heavy lifting. Despite some positive programs, the focus and scale of action at the national level currently falls short of what is needed to give Australia the best chance of becoming a renewable superpower.” 
Also lagging, but not to the dawdling extent of the federal government, are Western Australia (WA) and Queensland (QLD), which WWF-Australia’s analysis shows are under-capitalising on their resources. 


Ison stressed that WWF-Australia’s analysis shows that as a whole, Australia is not doing near enough to achieve the superpower status promised by its resources. With roughly $7 billion in clean energy stimulus measures invested across all governments in 2020, there is far more that needs to be done if we even want to draw level with countries like South Korea, France and Germany. 
“Our analysis shows that to become a real superpower,” said Ison, “we should look to use renewable energy to produce seven times the amount of electricity we currently consume. That would allow us to meet our electricity demands, transition our transport, industries and buildings to renewables from gas, coal and oil, and export excess power and zero-carbon products to the world. Australia can become the world’s leading exporter of renewables by 2030 if we act now.” 

WWF-Australia is also offering solutions, calling on the federal budget to back initiatives like Renewable Energy Industrial Precincts for the transition of manufacturing industries. On top of that WWF-Australia calls on all states, territories and the federal government to develop costed Renewable Energy Exports Industry Strategies, to accelerate the renewable energy rollout, to deliver necessary infrastructure and, citing Canada’s “Just Transition Task Force”, to ensure that this energy transition is not merely a repetition of old unsustainable forms of power, but that Indigenous Australians, workers, regional communities and low-income earners are all included and benefitted by this brave new world. 
The reception
Ross Garnaut, the man who has driven much of Australia’s general ambition to become a renewable energy superpower, said that “there is a chasm between a world that quickly breaks the link between modern economic growth and carbon emissions, and a world that fails to do so. The side of the chasm we are now on is a dangerous place. The other side has immense opportunity for Australian prosperity. WWF in their Renewables Superpower Scorecard does us a great service in measuring our position against the chasm.” 
Smart Energy Council (SEC) chief executive John Grimes added that Australia needs a strong economy and a safe climate, and “you can’t have one without the other and Australia won’t have a strong economy and a safe climate unless it becomes a global renewable energy exporting superpower. I commend WWF on this critical work.”

An international research group has sought to establish which form of energy vector between hydrogen transport and high-voltage submarine cables is the most economical solution for energy transport among countries separated by water.
The scientists stressed that, as a general rule, the relative cost of electricity transmission, both in terms of power and distance, is higher than that for fuel transportation. They wanted to assess, however, if this principle would also apply to hydrogen transported through submarine pipelines or by ships in liquefied and compressed states, noting that transforming hydrogen into electricity does not happen without energy losses, and that hydrogen costs may vary depending on electricity prices. “The main source of losses originates from the electrolysis, regardless of the distance,” they stated. “For long distances, the permeation through the pipeline is noticeable.”
The researchers were also able to assess for the first time under which conditions it can be cheaper than the full electric alternative.
The academics outlined four different scenarios under three different electricity prices of $20/MWh or $5.6 per gigajoule (GJ); $40/MWh or $11.1/GJ; and of 60 $/MWh or $16.7/GJ. “The first two scenarios evaluated the power transmission of 2 GW between two shores separated by either shallow or deep waters,” they specified. “Whilst the remaining two scenarios analysed the power transmission of 600 MW between an offshore platform, close to an offshore wind farm, and its hinterland, in shallow and deep waters.”
Their analysis showed that the competitiveness of hydrogen transport increases when the distance between the two shores is higher, depending on the electricity price. For example, in the first scenario, called Onshore to onshore shallow waters, at a price of $20/MWh, the cheapest option, for short distances, is the electric cable. When a distance of 1,690 km is crossed, however, hydrogen transport becomes the most competitive solution. At a price of $40/MWh, the hydrogen pipeline becomes the best option after 2,100 km and at a price of $60/MWh the threshold shifts to 2,480 km.
In the second scenario, dubbed Onshore to onshore deep waters, the three thresholds were found to be 760 km, 960 km, and 1,160 km, respectively.
In the first of the two offshore-to-onshore scenarios, called Offshore to onshore shallow waters, the hydrogen alternative becomes more convenient after 3,640, 3,960, and 4,250 km respectively, while in the second Offshore to onshore deep waters scenario, the favourable conditions for hydrogen materialise after 1,990 km, 2,150 km, and 2,320 km, respectively.
“For the offshore-to-onshore in shallow waters and deep waters, with a power rating of 600 MW, the electric cable is clearly the best energy vector,” the research group found. “In contrast, for the onshore-to-onshore scenarios with power rating of 2 with the electricity price at the exporting end cheaper than $40/MWh ($11.1 /GJ), the hydrogen alternative of the liquefied hydrogen ship represents better prospects than the electric solution for distances above 2,000 km for shallow waters and 1,200 km, for deep waters.”
It also concluded that the best LCOE option for short distances is the submarine cable, while hydrogen sent by ship is preferable when the distance exceeds 1,000 km and electricity prices are low. “From the results of this analysis, it can be seen that, under the assumptions made, the compressed hydrogen ship alternative does not present very good prospects of applicability in the future, unless some disruptive technological breakthroughs are made to significantly drop the associated costs or increase the capacity of the compressed hydrogen ships,” the researchers affirmed.
What makes compressed and liquified hydrogen ships still attractive, however, is that they can export energy almost anywhere, and that electrolysis and liquefaction plants are relatively easy to expand compared to marine cables. “I think that hydrogen and electricity have specific niches where each energy vector performs better than the other,” research co-author Rafael d’Amore-Domenech told pv magazine. More chemical energy vectors will probably appear in the future, and depending on the boundary conditions of each application, the “ranking” of the energy vectors will vary, he added. “I do not believe that they will compete. Instead, I think that all the alternatives will harmoniously complement each other in the future green economy.”
The findings of the research were presented in the study “Bulk power transmission at sea: Life cycle cost comparison of electricity and hydrogen as energy vectors,” published in Applied Energy. The research team comprises scientists from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and Spain’s Technical University of Madrid.

The contribution made by falling panel costs to the future price of solar power will be minimal, according to one executive at Sino-Canadian manufacturer Canadian Solar.
Yan Zhuang, president of the CSI Solar manufacturing operation of the company which is set for an IPO in China next quarter, today stated: “The era of ever-declining solar module prices is largely behind us.”
The comments were made on the Canadian Solar website as the company presented its fourth-quarter and full-year figures, and explain why the business is moving into energy storage on a big scale. In fact, Canadian Solar chairman and CEO Shawn Qu predicted the business would claim around 10% of this year’s U.S. battery storage market.
The manufacturer and project developer had highlighted shortages of panel raw materials polysilicon, PV glass and backsheets in its third-quarter results and, although the associated hit in shipment volumes, margin and revenue was not as stark as feared in the final three months of the year, Zhuang said: “We are approaching the bottom of the solar cost curve,” and indicated near term module price rises.
The CSI Solar business unit chief said polysilicon prices had leapt another 25% “recently” although solar glass costs had started to come down and shipping expenses had shown signs of returning to normality after a Covid-affected year. The hit to Canadian Solar had been partially mitigated by the efforts of its “customers and partners,” said Yan, “who were able to share a portion of the higher costs.”
Canadian appears to be readying to draw a line between its manufacturing and project development operations with the planned IPO, which is expected to take place in the next quarter. CSI Solar will house the manufacturing operation and, Canadian revealed yesterday, its Chinese solar project business will also be bundled into the unit, with the remaining business devoted to non-Chinese project development–generation and battery storage assets.
The storage portfolio held by the company has trebled from less than 3 GWh a year ago to almost 9 GWh, according to Canadian Solar corporate VP Ismael Guerrero, with almost 1 GWh under construction. On the traditional generation side of operations, Canadian said it has a 20.2 GWp solar project pipeline, with 1.6 GWp under construction plus 3.8 GWp within four years of completion. That is despite an accelerated project sell-off in Mexico, Japan, Canada, Italy and the U.S. to help mitigate the revenue hit caused by rising solar production costs.
The bottom line saw fourth-quarter shipments fall 5% to 2,998 MW and, although revenue rose 14%, quarter-on-quarter–to US$1.04 billion–the net income for the company fell from the US$9 million banked in July-to-September to US$7 million. In full-year terms, net income fell sharply from US$172 million in 2019, to US$147 million last year, despite net revenue rising from US$3.2 billion to US$3.48 billion over the same period.
With the company repeating its intent to sell off 1.8-2.3 GWp of solar project capacity this year–rising to 4-4.5 GWp in 2025–Canadian said it expects to have shipped 3-3.2 GW of modules this quarter, to generate US$1-1.1 billion in revenue, at a margin of 16-18%. The company expects to ship 18-20 GW of panels this year for revenue of US$5.6-6 billion.
