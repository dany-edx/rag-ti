It’s come to this. The Australian Energy Markets Commission has produced a draft decision that will make households and small business with solar panels pay to inject their surplus production into the grid.
It suggests an annual charge of about A$100 per solar-connected household.
The arrangement will only apply to small producers — almost all of whom are solar-enabled households. It won’t apply to large producers who will continue to export to the shared grid without charge.
The Victoria Energy Policy Centre’s analysis of 7,212 household electricity bills finds the typical Victorian household with solar panels exports about 2,200 kilowatt hours per year. This is about the amount of electricity an electric vehicle needs to cover about 12,000 kilometres, which is about the average annual mileage in Australia.
On the basis of feed-in rates that will soon apply in Victoria, we estimate that the typical solar system will provide the typical Victorian household with feed-in income of around $120 per year.
The proposed export charge of $100 will therefore almost totally offset the feed-in income, meaning households with rooftop solar would effectively get nothing for the surplus power they deliver to the grid.
However the proposed annual fee of $100 from the 2.7 million households with solar panels will raise $270m per year.
The Commission says it wants this sent back to all households in the form of lower charges. Before accounting for other factors that this change will effect, our calculations suggest this will cut the typical bill for households without solar by about 1.7%. After accounting for the Commission’s sun tax the typical bill for households with solar will increase by about 7%.
When the ABC and others reported the decision, it drew irate responses.
The Commission argues that small consumers should pay to use the grid whether they are injecting electricity into it or withdrawing electricity from it, and that if charges only applied to withdrawals then those customers that injected would be subsidised by those that withdrew.

At first sight, it seems reasonable. On closer inspection, it isn’t.
This is because the households that inject electricity also withdraw electricity and injections are typically much smaller than withdrawals and do not meaningfully increase network costs.
Residential connections are usually limited to at least 40 amps which, at 250 volts, allows a flow at the rate of 10 kilowatts.
Only a tiny number of rooftop solar systems produce this much – the median system is less than half that size.
This means networks can easily accommodate residential injections without incurring significant expenditure apart from a few adjustments such as balancing the voltage across phases of a circuit or adjusting transformers.
This is seldom more than routine work and it shows up as small claims approved by the regulator as “distributed energy integration”.
For Powercor, the Victorian distributor that has the highest rooftop solar penetration, the regulator and Powercor has agreed distributed energy integration expenditure for the next five years that will add just 0.1% to its allowed revenues.
The proposed injection charge seems to reflect the Commission’s view that injectors should pay for sunk as well as incurred costs. Standard welfare economics treats sunk costs like it treats taxes. It says the best way to recover them is to raise them from the activities that the tax will change the least.
Households have little choice but to withdraw electricity from the grid (when the sun’s not shining or their battery is running low – if they have one), but they can easily choose not to install solar.
Since the Commission’s proposal will reduce typical injection income to almost zero, it is very likely to slow the uptake of solar.

This will destroy welfare. Distributed solar provides benefits for all consumers since it is close to where it is needed (and so reduces the need for transmission) and it displaces more expensive fossil fuel generation and so reduces wholesale prices.
The 2.7 million households that already solar have another reason to be upset. It will reduce the return on the investments that governments encouraged them to make.
The Commission might feel that the consumer backlash is not its problem: it has done its job in recommending an economically sensible charge. But it is wrong: it has proposed a distortionary and welfare-destroying “sun tax”.
The Commission reports to the states and Commonwealth. There must surely be little chance the states will accept the recommendation. If they do, to avoid confronting an administrative behemoth, they are likely to water down the recommendation to the point where all that is left is more pointless bureaucracy.
But even this relatively benign outcome would be a mistake. It would undermine consumers’ and investors’ already fragile confidence in national energy policy.
In a previous article I argued that the states should take back control of electricity from organisations such as the Australian Energy Markets Commission.
Victoria and then New South Wales passed laws last year to begin to do that and are rapidly developing their own arrangements.
The proposed sun tax is likely to encourage the states to pull away yet further.

Part competition, part business program – how it works is Australians with a cleantech startup concept apply by sending in a short description of their business idea and what technology they are looking at. Climate-KIC Australia, which is a sister organisation of Europe’s Climate-KIC funded by the European Union, then selects around 40 teams to proceed into its program, which includes a three day bootcamp in capital cities across the country built around developing pitch decks and customer offerings.
“We don’t shy away from it, it’s a business competition,” Lee told pv magazine Australia. After this process, finalists are selected and mentored before a state-based final, followed by a national final. The winner of which will be awarded a $50,000 grant put forward by Humanitech, a think+do tank established by the Australian Red Cross in partnership with Telstra.
Winner will then proceed to the global finals, in which over 50 different countries last year took part (virtually, of course).
“Our motivation as the Australian Red Cross is to have that impact perspective in the use of technology,” Alastair Pryor, Humanitech’s Lab Manager, told pv magazine Australia. “The power and impact we can create out of something like this really demonstrates to the sector, and also to state and federal governments, that this is achievable – that cross sector approach.”
The program itself is a global offering and is operated the same everywhere, from its birthplace in Europe through to Australia, Southeast Asia and Africa where it runs today. In Australia, it’s funded by the Commonwealth government’s incubator program, making it entirely free for participants to take part in, granted their applications are accepted.
The program is focused on developing early-stage ideas – for instance, applicants can’t have already starting selling their products to customers. Though the competition isn’t looking for any particular kind of cleantech, Lee said once it get into the evaluation stages aspects like viability, climate impact, social impact, and team strength will all be part of the criteria.
“Our mission is to drive systemic change,” Lee says.
For Humanitech’s Alastair Pryor, the key is “supporting and identifying technologies that have impact and result, beyond just commercial viability. We want to see technology that is scaleable,” he said, adding that Humanitech already has funding allocated to help successful finalists scale their concept.
Previous Australian ClimateLaunchpad program participants include green shopping app Greener, organic waste recycler Localcycle, circular economy consultants Coreo, solar thermal PV tech company Sunovate and sodium-ion battery builders Elevenstore.
“If you have an emerging tech idea to tackle climate change then we want to help you get it off the ground,” Lee said.
Applications for this year’s competition are now open and close on April 22. Participation in the program is completely free of charge. You can apply here.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/31/regulator-pivots-approach-unveiling-new-mechanisms-to-crackdown-on-installer-misconduct/,"LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 31, 2021","Regulator pivots approach, unveiling new mechanisms to crackdown on accredited installer misconduct","In a seismic shift to how it regulates Australia’s solar industry, the Clean Energy Regulator, the Commonwealth government agency overseeing the integrity of Australia’s extensive solar certificates scheme, will now start proactively and directly going after rule-flouting installers.
“We’re mounting a major campaign on this and our hope is that any [installers] who have been doing the wrong thing mend their ways pretty quickly,” Executive General Manger in the Regulator’s Scheme Support Division, Mark Williamson, told pv magazine Australia.
In Australia, it is mandatory for an accredited installer to be on-site supervising the start, halfway point and end of solar installation at minimum. This is a requirement for the solar system to be eligible for small-scale technology certificates (STCs), the government scheme which underlies solar rebates.
Despite being a long-standing rule, the Clean Energy Regulator’s data analysis has revealed some installers continue to submit written statements claiming to have been on-site although it is logistically improbable, if not impossible, they were there.
“If accredited installers continue this practice of signing off on those written statements without having been [at the installation site] at least at the start, middle and end, they will lose their livelihood, they’ll be removed as a [Clean Energy Council] accredited installer and they’ll face either criminal or civil proceedings… and also we will disclose [the misconduct] to state and territory regulators, so they may lose their electrical license as well,” Williamson said.

Installers falsely signing off on written statements “is effectively a Commonwealth fraud,” Williamson added, noting the Regulator will be taking a zero-tolerance approach.
Recently, the Regulator has automated and improved its data analytics model, enabling it to be more proactive with identifying installers who may be submitting false claims.
As a government body, the Regulator has access to a wide range of data and also shares information with other government agencies and state and territory co-regulators. The Regulator has used this data to create its automated model which analyses trends and flags suspicious activity.
Precisely what metrics the model examines are naturally sensitive, but it includes information like the number of installations carried out by installers over a period of time, where they were done, and how far apart they were.
To test its efficacy, the Regulator ran its model to see if periods where installers were out of the country could be accurately accounted for. The findings were then cross referenced with Commonwealth records, which confirmed its accuracy.
With its analytics model verified, Williamson says the attention is squarely on using it to identify misconduct. Essentially, suspicious activity flagged by the model is then investigated and potentially substantiated by the Regulator through a range avenues covered below.
Coinciding with the development of the Regulator’s automated analytics model was a governmental review of the rooftop solar sector which spurred greater cooperations between solar industry regulators.
In August 2020, the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction announced a review into the rooftop solar PV sector, known as the Rooftop Solar Sector Review – its findings are expected to be released in the coming months.
The Review was requested following unprecedented growth in the sector (total capacity of rooftop solar installations grew from 750 MW in 2016 to almost 3 GW by 2020 – roughly a 300% increase in four years). This growth was accompanied by increasing reports of defective installations, misuse of accreditation details, and safety and quality concerns.

“If [the solar industry] wants to keep growing at this pace, it needs to put quality there and that means people need to comply,” Williamson said.
Previously, the Regulator had primarily pursued registered agents, like in the instance of One Stop Warehouse Finance, for the creation of fraudulent Small-scale Technology Certificates (STCs). While solar agents still hold the ultimate responsibility for certificate creation, the Regulator recognises agents rely on information from installers and retailers to create certificates. For that reason, it has now shifted its attention to what it sees as the root of the problem: installers – which had in the past primarily been the domain of the Clean Energy Council (CEC).
“The CEC under the current law regulates the accredited installers, but it does so under its own powers effectively. In other words, it has its point system and it can exit them, but it sets the rules around it,” Williamson said. “When we first ran that analytics model back in late 2019, that was when we started to give the Clean Energy Council information on installers we thought were doing the wrong thing, and that certainly was the start of us realising that on things like that it was important to work closely.”
During the [Solar] Review, the Regulator needed to seriously engage with CEC around how its regulatory framework actually works, lending the federal government agency and the industry peak body greater insight into how the other worked.
“During the course of the review, we engaged in a very thorough way with all stakeholders in the industry and stakeholder groups. We spent a lot of time with the CEC because under the regulatory model, it’s effectively a co-regulator,” Williamson said.
“That was the start of us starting to work closely together and we’ve been progressively working more closely together.”
In the coming weeks, the CEC is expected to contact all its accredited installers, informing them about what types of records they will now be required to keep, following input from the Regulator.
“We’ve decided jointly with the CEC, that enough is enough and we are going to be jointly messaging that the gloves are really off now,” Williamson said.

The Regulator told pv magazine Australia it already has a number of investigations on foot. That is on top of the investigations carried out by the Regulator last year which led to 36 installers having their Clean Energy Council accreditation cancelled.
“We are pursuing criminal investigations on a number of those,” Williamson said.
“Where our analytics model shows that we believe people are misbehaving, then they may get a statutory notice from us to present those records, or they’ll get a letter from the CEC,” Williamson said of the new investigations. The Regulator clarified that a records order from CEC will be issued to installers where suspicious activity has been flagged, whereas a statutory notice from the Regulator will be used when it is “very confident” the installer is indeed misbehaving.
The Clean Energy Regulator has two avenues for court proceedings at its fingertips: civil penalty proceedings or criminal prosecution.
Typically only the most egregious cases involving fraud go through the criminal system, which is both more drawn out and involves separate government agencies. “We provide evidence to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions who will independently assess the evidence and lay charges in the criminal court. A convicted person may receive a custodial sentence,” General Manager of the Clean Energy Regulator’s Compliance Branch, Daniel Bartlett, told pv magazine Australia.
The more common and far speedier type of proceeding is a civil case. “Our legislation creates civil penalty provisions for conduct such as giving false or misleading information to a registered agent. If we suspect a person has breached those provisions, we can apply to a court for a civil penalty order. The court may then order a person pay money to the Commonwealth. In enforcing that court order we may pursue a person’s assets,” Bartlett said.
“Criminal and civil proceedings are in addition to administrative action such as the Clean Energy Regulator suspending a person’s registration as a registered agent or the CEC cancelling an installer’s accreditation.”
From the Regulator’s point of view, one false submission is too much, Executive General Manger Williamson said. “An accredited installer completing or supervising the entire installation is one of the key controls in the [STC] scheme,” he added, noting the scheme has been the driving force behind Australia’s world leading rooftop solar uptake, making its integrity paramount.
“We’re essentially saying there’s going to be zero-tolerance for any installers who continue that practice.” The Regulator also plans to re-examine rule-flouting installers past installations for suspect behaviour too, capitalising on its ability to go back in time to investigate wrongdoings.
“We believe that most are doing the right thing, but those who aren’t have had ample warning. It’s always been clear-cut in the CEC guidelines that you must supervise the start, middle and end, so there is no excuse as far as we’re concerned.
“If anyone hasn’t changed their ways to doing the right thing, they need to do so now or they will face effectively the loss of their livelihood, prosecution and being exited by the CEC,” Williamson warned.
The Regulator’s ultimate goal is to see checks verifying accredited installers presence linked with the Solar Panel Validation (SPV) initiative. Launched in 2018, the SPV program aimed to address the installation of unapproved solar panels under the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme, and has been largely hailed as a success. The program uses smartphone apps, which scan serial numbers and checks them against a database to ensure the panels are approved. 
Today, about 73% of Small-scale Technology Certificate claims are made using Solar Panel Validation apps, General Manager of the Clean Energy Regulator’s Renewable Energy Target Branch, Matt Power, told pv magazine Australia.
Some of these apps have photo capability which can be taken along with locking in geo-coordinates, the date and time. “Opportunity exists to augment SPV apps to include photo capability to lock in geo-coordinates which could be used to show an installer has been on site at the beginning, middle and end of an installation,” Williamson said.
“That would be our preferred method because technical solutions can play a great role in supporting installer compliance,” he added.
Over 90% of claims made using SPV scheme are being processed in less than 24 hours. The speed and ease of the process is behind the scheme’s high uptake, and is yet another reason the Regulator would like to see installer compliance integrated into the program.
The Regulator is now actively working with SPV providers to streamline the evidence that can be used to show that installers are complying with STC eligibility requirements, with work on that still in the early stages.

Now, the company has taken its core offering and redesigned it for the purposes of mass production, set on becoming a frontrunner in what the company’s CEO and Managing Director, Tim Harris, sees as major shift in the energy storage market.
“I think there’s increasing recognition that there are many different technologies around energy storage and perhaps lithium is not the answer to all the needs of the market, especially as the market is moving away from that sole focus on grid stabilisation and FCAS type markets to solar-shifting,” Harris tells pv magazine Australia.
“There’s a drive towards demonstration of renewable energy throughout the day, which is where medium-duration energy storage really comes into its own.”
Wood Mackenzie
Flow batteries are an intrinsically different beast to the predominant lithium-ion batteries, the domain of giants like Tesla. Lithium-ion batteries are what’s known as solid-state batteries, storing energy in metal. Flow batteries, on the other hand, store energy in electrolyte liquids. They are usually designed to have two tanks, one containing a positively-charged anode and the other with a negatively-charged cathode, separated by a membrane.
Using liquids allows flow batteries to produce electrical currents without degradation, giving the batteries a longer cycle life and allowing them to store charge for longer periods compared to lithium-ion batteries. Flow batteries can also be fully discharged without damage, and are easily scaleable – able to be fitted to one another to increase capacity.
Flow batteries also lend themselves to recycling, which is an aspect Harris thinks will become increasingly relevant for Redflow’s overall offering – especially given just 2% of Australia’s annual 3,300 tonnes of lithium-ion battery waste is currently recycled.
Their pitfall? Size. Tanks of fluid can, by nature, only be made so small. Which is part of the reason lithium-ion batteries have been far quicker out the gate – we’ve needed small, high-powered batteries a lot longer than we have utility-scale ones. Despite being arguably less well suited for larger scale applications, lithium-ion batteries have benefited massively from their ubiquity and visibility, having been used for decades in our phones, laptop chargers and now in our EVs.
Yet, as Harris notes, lithium-ion technology start to lose their commercial attractiveness when it comes to storing energy for more than four hours. “That leaves a gap for medium-duration storage companies like us to address.”
Image: Redflow
And address it, they have. The first three months of 2021 have already been huge for Redflow – it began customer trials for its new Gen 3 model and it closed its biggest sale to date, selling 192 of its zinc-bromine flow batteries to waste conversion specialists Anaergia for $1.5 million.
“It’s been a pretty exciting couple of months for us,” Harris says.
Redflow
The company’s growth spurt (Redflow has sold 1.2 GWh of energy to customers to date) comes after a period of pandemic-induced hibernation. “Gen 3 has been in the works for sometime but Covid has allowed us to spend time and resources on that,” Harris explains. “It’s a major milestone for us. It’s our key vehicle to get costs out of the battery.”
Redflow’s next generation model has seen a major design overhaul from its previous ZCell and ZBM2 models. Its new model includes a single rather than double stack design, tanks which sit side by side, a new electronics board and cooling system. The changes have all been made with the goal of mass production in mind, with the company aiming to get 30% out of the price through the reengineering and supply chain savings.
“Customers won’t see a difference, it will still be a 10 kWh battery but the supply chain savings we can make and the simplicity around production and manufacturing of our battery is a major advancement.”
The company expects the Gen 3 to be in full production by the second half of this year, with its eyes on further driving down costs through economies of scale. “As we start to produce that Gen 3 battery, in manufacturing them we clearly think there’s further savings that we can get to as we ramp up volumes.”
Redflow
The batteries are currently manufactured in Chonburi in Thailand, an automotive manufacturing hub southeast of Bankok. Redflow relocated its production there at the start of 2018, drawn by the parallels between its own processes and the skills needed to manufacture cars. “It’s a very high quality labour force we’ve found there,” Harris says.
“[Our] facility now, we’ve designed that to do up to 60 MWh, so its flexible in terms of the next growth ambition that we have.”
Nonetheless, Harris isn’t ruling out shifting or partially shifting Redflow’s manufacturing base – especially as the company explores a new frontier: automation.
Harris says Redflow is now looking at automating certain processes within its existing manufacturing approach.
“We think there’s a lot of opportunity for us to do that and we haven’t really touched the sides of the benefits from automation in terms of our manufacturing yet… and that’s a function of volume manufacturing approaches that we’re excited about.”
Redflow’s batteries are still fairly labour intensive to create, making labour costs an important factor. Yet through automation Harris is hopeful the company can develop its production potential into other markets. “Or even take some of that manufacturing facility, especially elements that can be automated, and relocate it to markets where it’s beneficial for us to do so,” he says.
“So if we saw some major demand here in Australia and there’s opportunities for automation, then clearly that adds to the potential attractiveness of Australia in the future.”
Harris still sees Thailand as good base for Redflow’s immediate growth, but as the company starts to see more demand, questions about moving production closer to its core market have arisen. Currently Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and parts of Asia are Redflow’s main customers.
Image: Redflow
Redflow’s recent $1.5 million sale to Anaergia’s California waste facility has opened up a new horizon for the Brisbane company though. “We want to use the [Anaergia deal] as a launchpad to hopefully expand our presence here in California,” Harris says. “We’ve always had a strategic eye on the US market, it’s one of the biggest markets for storage in the world and its growing significantly.”
As part of the deal, Redflow designed what it refers to as ‘energy pods’ – essentially, an enclosure containing 16 of its flow batteries and the power electronics necessary to operate them. “We think that’s probably the start of the building blocks that we need to go and target larger megawatt hour systems,” Harris says.
“It allows us to step into that higher voltage space that’s going to be necessary for large-scale industrial and commercial and potential utility elements, so that’s a major development for us.”
Flow batteries come in a range of different chemistries, the most common of which include vanadium, zinc-bromine and zinc-iron. Recently, vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) have been the primary subject of flow battery adoration, finally experiencing market interest after spending decades largely ignored.
Redflow, however, has chosen a different path, opting instead to use a zinc-bromine solution. “Zinc-bromine has the natural advantages over other flow battery chemistries such as vanadium,” Harris says.
Redflow
Firstly, vanadium, the metal at the batteries core, has seen significant pricing volatility recently, which is hardly ideal for manufacturers. “The second thing we have is higher energy density and efficiency than vanadium systems,” Harris says.
Anaergia apparently considered using vanadium flow batteries at its facility, before settling on Redflow’s zinc-bromine solution – with Harris saying Redflow’s solution was better able to meet the facility’s available footprint.
As just one of a handful of zinc-bromide flow battery producers in the world, too much competition is far from the company’s main issue. Given that, Harris relishes the success of any chemistry of flow battery, noting increased market acceptance ultimately benefits all flow battery producers.
The CEO is eager to see Australia to realise its potential as a clean energy powerhouse and an exporter of leading edge products. “There’s a fantastic opportunity for Australia as a nation to embrace that.”

Historically the function of keeping frequency and voltage in the electricity grid within safe limits has been performed by coal and other ‘synchronous’ generators, mostly gas and hydro. Now, with the Energy Security Board redesigning the National Electricity Market with its ‘Post-2025’ proposal to be agreed upon by ministers this year, the Australia Institute is proposing rule changes so these functions are not automatically relegated to fossil fuel-based sectors.
The technical study underpinning the report was carried out by the Victorian Energy Policy Centre with an aim to provide input into the Energy Security Board’s ‘Post-2025’ review, which is currently being concluded.
“The technical study finds that batteries and renewable energy are becoming competitive with conventional sources of inertia and system strength. There is no technical obstacle to them replacing the system security which has been provided by coal and gas generators,” the Australia Institute’s energy policy and regulatory lead, Dan Cass, said in the report.
“The rules governing the provision of inertia and system strength are not fit for purpose for the Post-2025 market. They are a brake on the clean energy transition and undermine state-based Renewable Energy Zones,” he added.
New inverter-based sources are already proving themselves cheaper and better than legacy technologies, Cass said, pointing to a project in North Queensland which had tuned its inverters at four large solar farms for around 4% the cost of a conventional synchronous condenser solution.
“Batteries can deliver far more system security than a coal generator of the same power capacity. When EnergyAustralia announced that the 1,480 MW Yallourn coal power station would close in 2028 it also announced a new 350 MW battery will be built in 2026. The battery is likely to be able to provide at least three times as much inertia as Yallourn, despite a capacity a quarter as large,” Cass noted.
Clean energy resources have traditionally been excluded from providing system security, the report says, but adds this began to shift in 2017. “Regulatory barriers continue to be the key limitation on batteries and renewable energy providing system security,” Cass concludes, however.
The Australia Institute also found there was popular support for using clean energy technologies to support the grid, rather than coal and gas. In March 2021, the institute conducted a national opinion poll of 1040 people which revealed 51% of Australians would prefer to pay for new batteries to keep the grid secure, where 26% prefer to continue to pay coal generators.
The Australia Institute is proposing three key objectives for the Post-2025 redesign: an increase competition, promotion of innovation, and pragmatism in accommodating state policies.

Following on from its recent announcement 
The news followed on the momentum of recent announcements from AGL including the forging ahead of plans to establish a 200 MW grid-scale battery at its Loy Yang power station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, the start of construction on its 250 MW one-hour-duration battery at the site of its Torrens Island power station in South Australia, its entering into a joint venture with the UK’s Ovo Energy for the exclusive rights to the company’s energy management platform, and AGL’s recent acquisitions of Epho and Solgen Energy Group – making it the largest commercial solar provider in Australia. 
All of these examples are the kind of long-overdue moves with the current of the energy transition that AGL had been resisting for so long, but is this partition another one? 
AGL’s plan is to partition itself into two energy businesses with separate strategies. Both have been given placeholder names, the first of these is “New AGL”, which will be Australia’s largest multi-product energy retailer by number of services to customers, providing electricity, gas, internet and mobile service to more than 30% of Australian households. The other is “PrimeCo”, Australia’s largest electricity generator, generating around 20% of the electricity demand in the National Electricity Market (NEM). 
This separation entails an entire restructuring of AGL’s business model and capital structure. According to AGL managing director and CEO, Brett Redman, “The accelerating market forces of customer, community and technology are driving the imperative to create this new path and separate AGL into two distinct organisations.” 

The idea is to give the retail business and the generator business the individual freedom to pursue their own agendas, “while playing an equally important, but different,” stressed Redman, “role in Australia’s energy transition.” To power its own transition, AGL will be reducing its operating costs by $150 million and selling soon-to-be-obsolete assets such as the Newcastle Gas Storage Facility and Silver Springs gas project. 
“An accelerating desire for action on climate change, shifts in government policy and rapidly falling technology costs, have changed our market,” said Redman
Redman added that New AGL would be carbon neutral for scope one and two emissions from the get-go, and have a clear structured pathway to full carbon neutrality. Although, as Redman said in his Investor Day speech, New AGL will “retain AGL’s leading low-cost thermal generation position and strong fuel supply position,” which is to say, AGL’s three coal-fired power stations. 
Image: AGL
Moreover, “This strong customer base would be backed by a leading energy trading capability and a 2.1 GW portfolio of flexible generation and storage assets to manage peak demand events.” 
As for PrimeCo, the generator sibling, this business will focus on the “safe and reliable running of its generation portfolio. As the low-cost backbone of the NEM it would be well positioned from day one to support the Australian economy as the energy market continues to evolve. PrimeCo’s strong base generation position brings with it a capacity” continued Redman, “to invest in development options including the transformation of existing generation sites into the energy hubs of the future”. 
Criticism
According to the Australian Financial Review, “investors believe a full demerger is on the cards for Australia’s oldest energy utility after AGL Energy said it would hive off its huge coal power plants into a separate business. This will allow the core retailing activities to emerge as a zero-carbon electricity supplier.”
Despite the optimism and advertised movements in the right direction from AGL in recent times, it seems as if these moves may have been largely performative, at least, that is what the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) thinks and has criticised AGL’s plans for partition. 
ACCR’s director of climate and environment, Dan Gocher, said that the move to split the company in two was AGL abandoning its responsibility on coal closure. “Just seven years after it acquired the last of its coal-fired power stations,” said Gocher, “AGL is walking away from managing their closure, by spinning them off into PrimeCo, which any responsible investor will surely avoid.” 
“Following a halving in AGL’s share price over the last year,” continued Gocher, “CEO Brett Redman is attempting to sell the demerger as a win for shareholders, claiming it would give both companies the ‘freedom’ to pursue their own ‘growth agendas’. This is optimistic at best, and delusional at worst.” 
Gocher points out that the partition will do nothing for the company’s emissions reduction, “but it may appease some institutional investors who have been demanding AGL do something to reduce its carbon exposure. AGL has chosen the easy way out, leaving the heard decisions around coal closure to whoever is chosen to run PrimeCo.” 
Effectively, Gocher argues that AGL has thrown in the towel and selected a scapegoat. “AGL has no plans to encourage electrification and continues to promote the use of fossil gas in order to justify its planned Crib Point gas import terminal. Despite the 2021 AEMO Gas Statement of Opportunities highlighting the flatlining of industrial demand for fossil gas, along with the opportunity to further decrease demand through household electrification, fuel switching and energy efficiency.”
Recent news coming out of AGL has suggested the company, which generates 8% of Australia’s emissions, was beginning to take the lead when it came to the energy transition. Gocher argues instead that “AGL had the opportunity to embrace the energy transition by accelerating its decarbonisation, but it has chosen to spin off its most polluting assets to the detriment of us all.”

Not only will the site house a 200 MW grid-scale battery which is already in the application process, but now AGL is exploring proposals for floating solar developments for contribution to the Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain project (HESC). 
The pilot plant for the HESC is already producing hydrogen from the Loy Yang coal mine for export to Japan, but of course, in the future, Japan will only be in the market for green hydrogen. 

“Over time,” said AGL COO Markus Brokhof, “Loy Yang will grow to a more diverse hub of different energy uses that leverage the unique attributes of the Loy Yang site and Latrobe Valley more broadly.” 

In addition to Loy Yang, it also looks like AGL is looking at the potential of partnering the now under construction 250 MW battery at the site of the company’s Torrens Island power station in South Australia. 
According to Brokhof, “The development plan comprises battery sites, waste to energy, electrothermal solar storage, as well as site specific development opportunities using our strategic asset base such as the Antiene coal unloader in the Hunter Valley to develop a distribution hub and the Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain project at Loy Yang.”

Munich-based energy technology company Siemens Energy announced plans last week to produce green hydrogen at $1.50/kg by 2025 “based on large-scale commercial projects in operation.” Currently, the project is based on wind energy. The underlining assumptions are a cost of $16/MWh and a 100 MW electrolyser running 16.4 hours a day on average. The German company is set to roll out its in-house proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis technology to implement a gigawatt production of electrolysers. Siemens Energy describes green hydrogen as “the second stage of the energy transition.”
British energy company BP and UK gas distributor Northern Gas Networks (NGN) signed a memorandum of understanding last week to collaborate on hydrogen projects in the north of England. The two companies will study the impact of BP’s Teesside hydrogen plans on local industrial and domestic consumers. BP also announced last week a project to build a 1 GW blue hydrogen facility in the conurbation around the River Tees, covering 20% of the UK’s hydrogen target by 2030. “It’s fantastic to see BP planning to invest in hydrogen production at Teesside, placing our region at the forefront of a green recovery,” said NGN CEO Mark Horsley. The gas distributor said the conversion of the UK gas network to transport 100% hydrogen was economically viable. Pending regulatory approval expected in the next three months, NGN will start delivering a blend of 20% hydrogen to 670 properties in Winlaton, near Gateshead, while working to demonstrate the safety of hydrogen-fuelled appliances to earn the local population’s support.

Industry partners Arcelor Mittal Bremen, EWE, FAUN, Gasunie, swb and Tennet launched the Clean Hydrogen Coastline project in northern Germany on Wednesday. The project is aimed at integrating hydrogen technology into the German and European energy systems. Around 400 MW of electrolysis capacity should be deployed by 2024, with corresponding storage of hydrogen in the energy system. The project envisages total investments of up to €1.3 billion, Arcelor Mittal Bremen said in a statement. “We have the best conditions in northern Germany — the wind power region — to integrate hydrogen as an integral part of the energy system and lay the foundation for a European hydrogen economy,” commented EWE CEO Stefan Dohler.
South Korea-based industrial conglomerate Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings (HHIH) and Saudi state-run oil company Saudi Aramco signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly developed hydrogen and ammonia-related businesses. The two companies are looking for cooperation opportunities in joint research and development and using subsidiaries to promote specific projects. Hyundai Oilbank, the oil refinery unit of HHIH, is to import liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for conversion into blue hydrogen. It plans to open 300 hydrogen charging stations in the country by 2040. In the next three years, Hyundai Oilbank also expects to receive blue ammonia from Saudi Aramco and use it as fuel for liquefied natural gas (LNG) boilers. “The two parties will also strengthen cooperation in the shipbuilding business. Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering will be the first shipbuilder to develop a ship that can carry both liquefied petroleum gas cargoes and captured carbon dioxide at once,” HHIH said in a statement.
Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala Investment Company and Italian gas infrastructure specialist Snam signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on hydrogen projects in the United Arab Emirates. They will carry out technical and economic feasibility studies to promote hydrogen development in the Gulf and elsewhere. The companies have not explained what type of hydrogen they are focusing on. “This signing with Snam is an extension of our joint efforts to develop a hydrogen economy for the UAE, and we are committed to advancing the role hydrogen will play to meet future energy demand globally,” said Musabbeh Al Kaabi, CEO of UAE Investments at Mubadala Investment Company. Snam said it considered the UAE and Gulf region of strategic importance “because of their crucial role in the energy transition.”
The UK government announced an £11.2 million project to manufacture low-cost hydrogen fuel cell technology for buses and create a hydrogen centre in Ballymena, Northern Ireland. “This will continue to level up our local economy, allowing Wrightbus to continue producing the next generation of world-leading hydrogen buses,” commented Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis. Wrightbus Executive Chairman Jo Bamford aims to increase production and significantly lower costs. The investment is part of a £54 million package, including a project for electric propulsion systems for heavy goods vehicles in Wales and a second project for energy-saving technology for cars and vans in Warwickshire.
French industrial gas provider Air Liquide, through its majority-owned joint venture Air Liquide Far Eastern (ALFE), has completed the first phase of the construction of hydrogen electrolysers in Taiwan. The €200 million plan announced in April 2020 aims to produce up to 5,000 Nm3 of ultra-high purity hydrogen per hour. The hydrogen will be used by the semiconductor industry and emerging hydrogen applications in the island. The group will continue the construction of its phase 2 to phase 5 hydrogen electrolyser plants in Taiwan over the next two years for a total capacity of 25 MW.
The California Energy Commission, the primary energy policy and planning agency of the US state, awarded Sierra Northern Railway and GTI nearly $4 million to fund the design, integration and demonstration of a hydrogen fuel cell switching locomotive at the Port of West Sacramento. The project includes advanced hydrogen fuel cell, hydrogen storage, advanced battery and system control technologies. The demonstration project will collect data on the performance and the costs of the technology. “The potential California market for new hydrogen locomotives includes more than 260 switcher locomotives and up to 500 intrastate locomotives,” Sierra Northern Railway said in a statement.
Boeing subsidiary Insitu announced earlier this month that it completed the first flight of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) powered by a hydrogen-fuelled, proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. The 30-minute flight conducted in December 2020 lays the ground for test flights using a Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) storage tank on the aircraft later this year. “The 3-D-printed LH2 tank is an industry first, and is expected to support 10+ hours of endurance for ScanEagle3,” the company said in a statement, explaining that fuel cells showed improved reliability and significantly lower logistics costs in comparison to small IC engine propulsion solutions. “For our global defence customers, fuel-cell-powered UAS [unmanned aircraft systems] in this Group 2 space represents a significant game-changer in the battlespace,” said Andrew Duggan, managing director of Insitu Pacific.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/31/oci-increases-production-capacity-at-malaysian-polysilicon-factory/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,MALAYSIA,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 31, 2021",OCI increases production capacity at Malaysian polysilicon factory,"From pv magazine Global. 
OCIM Sdn Bhd (OCIMSB), the Malaysian unit of South Korean polysilicon producer OCI, will ramp up the annual production capacity of its polysilicon factory in the Samalaju Industrial Park in Sarawak, Malaysia, by 5,000 metric tons (MT).
“OCIMSB’s SoG Poly-Si production capacity is 30,000 MT/year, and it will be expanded to 35,000 MT/year by the second half of 2022,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
OCIM will invest around $55 million in the Malaysian plant, which resumed manufacturing in mid-July. The group raised the plant’s capacity from 10,000 MT to 27,000 MT between 2018 and 2019.
With the new capacity additions, the group’s total annual polysilicon output – including its 3,000-MT factory in Gunsan, South Korea – will reach 38,000 MT.
“The Malaysian plant is currently in full operation, and the maintenance schedule has not been decided as of now,” the spokesperson said. “The Korean plant is currently not fully operational, and is scheduled to be fully operational from next year.”
The company shut down the Gunsan plant in February 2020, due to downward price pressure in the South Korean polysilicon industry. However, polysilicon prices are now much higher, and PV demand remains strong, the company noted.
