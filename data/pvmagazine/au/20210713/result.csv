The lab was officially opened on Tuesday by the Australian Capital Territory’s Chief Minister, Andrew Barr, who said the facility will “cement” the state’s position a leader in renewable energy innovation and collaboration, as well as unlock new opportunities in the economy and jobs markets.
The lab was announced back in 2019 and supported by $1.5 million in funding from the ACT government. The project of designing and constructing the facility was a partnership between ITP Renewables, University of New South Wales Canberra, Evoenergy and ANU.
We're super charged ⚡️to officially launch the Distributed Energy Resources Lab today!
The lab mirrors our electricity grid & allows us to test the new tech driving our low-carbon energy future before the switch is flicked on — like EVs! 🚗https://t.co/9Inp0383DQ pic.twitter.com/vKbWSMY1bT

“Now more than ever, Australia must design an energy system fit for the 21st century,” ANU Vice-Chancellor Professor Brian Schmidt said.
“As Australia moves away from large centralised fossil-fuel powered generators to a decentralised grid consisting of a vast array of distributed renewable energy assets, we need to find innovative ways to enable this vast amount of renewable energy to safely and effectively enter the electricity grid.
“It is through the research carried out in the Distributed Energy Resources Lab that we, as a society, will be equipped with the technology and capabilities that will help smooth out and accelerate this vital energy transition,” Professor Schmidt added.
The ANU lab opens just a few weeks after Victoria’s Deakin University attracted million dollars of funding from both the state and federal governments for two new research and development facilities, one dedicated to battery research and the other to hydrogen.

In a statement, Hyzon said it will deliver five 154-tonne hydrogen trucks to Ark Energy, owned by global giant Korea Zinc, for use by sister company, Townsville Logistics. Hyzon claims to have the world’s first and the only ultra-heavy-duty hydrogen truck.
“When we scoured the world for fuel cell trucks, we found that Hyzon Motors was the only hydrogen mobility company that could manufacture fuel cells stacks with a sufficient power density to meet our requirements including the ultra-heavy payload and built to Australian Design Rules,” Ark Energy CEO, Daniel Kim, said in a statement. “In addition, Hyzon Motors was the only OEM [original equipment manufacturer] that was interested in supplying the Australian market in the next 18 months.”

The trucks are expected to be fuelled by Ark Energy’s own hydrogen refilling station, with hydrogen produced through a solar farm and electrolyser. “By generating hydrogen from a renewable energy source, Hyzon and Ark Energy aim to create a green solution for both supply and utilisation, enabling the first refinery to produce green zinc,” the company’s statement read.
Korea Zinc’s Sun Metals refinery is currently Queensland’s second largest single-site energy consumer. In November of last year, it pledged to power its entire operations with 100% renewable electricity by 2040, with an interim target of 80% by 2030. 
“Through Ark Energy, Korea Zinc leads this notoriously hard-to-abate sector – demonstrating that decarbonisation can happen now,” Hyzon’s CEO, Craig Knight, said. “This initial order and Ark Energy’s hydrogen hub lays the foundation for an emissions-free future.”
The news comes just weeks after Hyzon signed its first memorandum of understanding for its 154-tonne hydrogen truck with a European customer, making giant Korea Zinc its second customer for the heavy-duty vehicles. “As the world’s first and the only ultra-heavy-duty hydrogen truck, the Hyzon 154-tonne class hydrogen truck is winning market momentum,” the company said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/13/historic-50-gw-renewable-hydrogen-hub-proposed-for-wa-by-consortium-behind-recently-rejected-project/,"HYDROGEN,UTILITY SCALE PV,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JULY 13, 2021",‘Historic’ 50 GW renewable hydrogen hub proposed for WA,"CWP Global and InterContinental Energy, two of the main proponents behind the recently rebuffed Asia Renewable Energy Hub, today announced they are proposing a new, even more ambitious project in Western Australia’s Goldfields–Esperance region, in the state’s south east.
The proposed Western Green Energy Hub intends to scale to a massive 50 GW of solar and wind, the electricity from which would go towards producing millions of tonnes of either green hydrogen or its derivative, green ammonia. The project is estimated to cost up to $100 billion and would be spread across 15,000 square kilometres in the Shire of Dundas and the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder.
To put into perspective the scale of the proposal, Australia’s largest coal plant is just 2.9GW. Or, another way of putting it, is that the generation capacity of all of the coal, gas and renewables currently in the national energy market (which includes all states except WA and the Northern Territory) is just over 50 GW.
Western Australia’s Minister for Hydrogen Industry, Alannah MacTiernan, put out a statement this morning saying she “welcomed the announcement” and confirmed the project’s proponents had secured a licence to collect data and to develop the project’s feasibility on the proposed site. That the application was supported by the traditional owners, the Mirning people, she added.
The proposal comes less than a month after Australia’s federal environment minister Sussan Ley rejected the environmental approvals for the 26 GW Asia Renewable Energy Hub, proposed by a consortium including CWP and InterContinental Energy. When revealed in June, Ley’s decision caused controversy and led to accusations of double standards among renewable versus fossil fuel projects.  The consortium behind Asia Renewable Hub has said it will work to amend its plans so the  project can go ahead.

Chairman of the new Western Green Energy Hub’s (WGEH) board, Brendan Hammond, described the project as “historic” both in terms of its scale and its partnership with First Nations Land Owners. According to the project group’s statement, Mirning Green Energy Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Mirning Traditional Lands Aboriginal Corporation, will have a “meaningful carried equity stake” in the project and a permanent seat on the project’s consortium board.
“As First Nations Land Owners, the Mirning People are excited to hold such an integral and defining stake in this historical partnership with WGEH,” Trevor Naley, Chairman of the Mirning Traditional Lands Aboriginal Corporation and inaugural Mirning Board Member for the project, said. “This partnership through robust governance and a seat at the table for Mirning People will provide opportunities never before available to Indigenous Corporations. This representation alongside sustainable financial and substantial social benefits will provide security for future generations.”
The project is proposed in WA’s Goldfields–Esperance region, described by the Western Green Energy Hub’s (WGEH) statement as a prime area for renewables development. “The region provides an optimal diurnal profile for renewable energy, with consistently high levels of wind and solar energy over a 24-hour period,” it said.
The consortium plans to build the project in phases, eventually scaling up to produce 3.5 million tonnes of zero-carbon green hydrogen or 20 million tonnes of green ammonia per annum to be used domestically and exported.
“Green fuels produced at the site will meet massive future demand from multiple sectors, including in co-firing in power generation, the shipping sector, heavy industry such as steel, chemicals and mining, as well as the aviation sector,” the statement added.
The consortium estimates green hydrogen sector will become a US$2.5 trillion (AU$3.4 trillion) market by 2050.
“The Western Green Energy Hub is a truly massive proposal that would see WA home to one of the world’s largest renewable energy projects,” state minister MacTiernan said. “Importantly, this project is a powerful collaboration between the Mirning traditional owners and industry, and would be a transformational opportunity for the community.” MacTiernan has previous said the state government aspires to have 200 GW of renewables for creating green hydrogen by 2040.

A group of scientists from the Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, in Saudi Arabia, has assessed the performance of several cooling techniques in solar PV systems subject to the country’s harsh environmental conditions.
The researchers’ analysis embraced passive cooling systems based on a heat sink or a heat sink embedded into phase change materials (PCMs), as well as active cooling relying on micro-flat heat pipes, either immersed or not immersed in an immersion fluid.
The passive technologies were assessed under two different configurations: an 11%-efficient polycrystalline solar module with a power output of 15 W, equipped with six aluminium heat sinks on the back panel; and the same panel equipped with heat sinks placed into a highly thermally conductive aluminium container filled with TPM350, which is a phase change material offering a high thermal conductivity and melting at 50 degrees Celsius. In all configurations, the solar panels were tilted at 25 degrees and south-oriented. Measurements took into account output power, the surface temperature of the modules, and power conversion efficiency.
Active cooling was considered in two forms: a system consisting of a row of four heat pipes cooled by flowing water and place onto the back of the panel; and another one consisting of four heat pipes immersed in a box of liquid, as liquid bulk, integrated with the back of the solar panel. “This technology is interesting for cooling purposes because it uses buoyancy flow of liquid and evaporative cooling in the heat pipes, as a means of transferring thermal energy,” the scientists explained, referring to the second system and noting that three different liquids, such as engine oil, ethylene glycol, and regular water, were tested.
The two passive techniques were found not to be performant enough to ensure proper cooling. That technique with the simple heat sinks was able to lower the module operating temperature by 10 degrees Celsius, on average; and that based on the PCM was able to guarantee sufficient cooling only for the first two hours. “When melting was completed, the PCM became ineffective, allowing the panel temperature to rise sharply, becoming greater than that of the uncooled panel due to the thermal resistance of the PCM,” the Saudi group stated, adding that a PCM with a higher melting point should be utilised.
As for the active system, the most effective was that based on four heat pipes immersed in water, which was able to reduce the panel temperature by up to 53%; followed by those immersed in ethylene glycol, which results in a 48% reduction; and those immersed in engine oil, which lowered the module temperature by 25%. The lowest percentage – 21% – was obtained by the row of four heat pipes cooled by flowing water. “Lower panel temperatures and higher open-circuit voltages at the solar panel terminals were found if the panel was actively cooled using heat pipes immersed in regular water,” the academics emphasized. “In this configuration, the voltage increment was 13%, relatively compared to the uncooled panel configuration.”
The findings of the research can be found in the paper Innovative technique for achieving uniform temperatures across solar panels using heat pipes and liquid immersion cooling in the harsh climate in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, published in Alexandria Engineering Journal.

The head of India’s solar trade body has told an online event the much-delayed manufacturing-linked solar tender which he said will commission 2 GW of annual photovoltaic-equipment production capacity and 6 GW of solar project generation, will be worth $6 billion.
Subrahmanyam Pulipaka, CEO of the National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI) told a two-day event organised by the Global Solar Council (GSC) the tender has been subscribed in a nation which expects to add at least 6-8 GW of module production capacity and 3-4 GW of cell output in the next two years.
The NSEFI chief also made the astounding claim developed countries had not paid a penny of what he described as a commitment to donate $100 billion to promote renewables in the developing world.
Referring to past UN climate change conferences, Pulipaka said: “Before COP 21 – of the Paris agreement – back in COP 18, developed countries [accepted they] have been polluting the world and are responsible for more than 75% of global emissions in the last three decades, equal to almost 894 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. [They] pledged $100 billion for developing countries back in 2012-2013. The same pledge was used again in article 9, point 11 of [the] COP 21 Paris agreement, re-emphasising that developed countries will pay 100 billion to developed countries. There is a 2015 agreement and now, in 2021, not even a single penny has been made.”
Warming to the theme, Pulipaka said his country had registered the world’s lowest price for an energy storage facility last year, and added: “India is the only G20 country and the only country among … four countries globally, which is in line to achieve its Paris commitment [of] decreasing its emission by 30%. As a developing country, India is leading by example to developed and developing countries on how to honour their commitments.”
The chief exec of the Indian solar trade group was speaking at an online event held by the Washington DC-based GSC, which is the umbrella organisation for the world’s national solar bodies. The event, held on Thursday and Friday, was organised with SolarPower Europe and EU investment entity Get.Invest.
Alejandro Labanda, head of regulation and studies at Spanish solar organisation Unión Española Fotovoltaica, repeated the oft-heard call to simplify the permitting of solar projects, and called for a presumption of approval in the absence of objections to such plants, something he referred to as ‘positive silence.’
Labanda said that principle should be applied to grid connection access as well as to planning and other permits and also called for full transparency on spare grid capacity and access availability for all players, rather than just for the electric utilities which, in many nations, still own the infrastructure they are bidding for access to alongside independent power producers who lack such network data.
