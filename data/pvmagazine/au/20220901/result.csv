Energy Renaissance founder and development director Brian Craighead said the new 4,500-square-metre Renaissance One plant at Tomago, just north of Newcastle in the Hunter Valley, will have an initial battery production capacity of up to 300 MWh per annum, with plans to scale the operation up to 5.3 GWh.
“Just a few years ago we were told it wasn’t possible to manufacture in Australia. Today, in the shadow of our soon-to-be-completed Renaissance One facility I can tell you that it is absolutely possible to manufacture in Australia,” he said.
The shift to the new facility follows the successful completion of a pilot program backed by the federal government’s Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre (AMGC). The pilot program, conducted at Energy Renaissance’s existing facility at Tomago, allowed the company to develop, test and document its technology, systems and processes and commence operations to supply to customers ahead of full-scale manufacture.

Energy Renaissance is currently producing up to 4 MWh of lithium-ion batteries per month for use in industrial and commercial applications but that will scale up significantly when operations are transferred.
The company said the Australian-made batteries, designed to cope with high temperature and humidity environments, will be used in stationary (grid and microgrid, renewables, community storage, mining electrification) and transport (buses, light commercial and industrial vehicles) applications. It is looking to supply both the local and export markets.
Energy Renaissance is aiming to leverage local suppliers and supply chain to make batteries that are as close to 100% Australian content as possible. The company, which continues to import battery cells, said supply partnerships mean 92%, or 32 of the 35 components that make up the company’s superStorage range of batteries are produced by or sourced from Australian companies.

“With the support of organisations such as AMGC and our partners, we have been able to develop a world-leading lithium-ion battery for domestic and export use and soon, we hope to expand the impact of this program to add value to Australia’s abundant raw materials by embarking on cell manufacture,” Craighead said.
AMGC managing director Jens Goennemann said Energy Renaissance is “proof positive” that Australia can be a world leader in the renewable energy industry.
“Energy Renaissance’s approach typifies how we should be seeking to move away from our reliance on raw commodities and tap into our abundant human, commodities and manufacturing prowess to transform it into complex goods for local and export markets,” he said.
“Energy Renaissance didn’t stop when they developed a battery for hot and humid climates, they embarked on commercialising the technology … they are a shining light for others to follow.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/01/h2x-goes-to-market-with-hydrogen-electricity-generators/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2022",H2X goes to market with hydrogen electricity generators,"H2X Global said the Australian-developed 5 kW fuel cell generator, which uses hydrogen to generate electricity with zero emissions, has been sold to the Plumbing Industry Climate Action Centre (PICAC) for use at its new $20 million Hydrogen Centre of Excellence in Queensland.
The Power H2 unit, which is powered by a hydrogen fuel cell and comes equipped with a small hydrogen storage tank, will be installed at the PICAC facility being developed at Beenleigh in the state’s southeast. Due to open next month, the centre will serve as Australia’s first dedicated training facility for training jobs of the future in hydrogen.
H2X Global chief executive Brendan Norman said the sale of the demonstration model marked a turning point for the use of renewable energy in emergency and off-grid power supply.
“We have developed a range of fuel cell generators delivering differing power outputs to be the alternative to fossil-fuel generators in the energy transition to zero emissions,” he said. “The generator is a turnkey hydrogen power solution with a zero-emissions operation.”
Norman said the hydrogen fuel cell gensets, which will be available in sizes ranging from 2 to 100 kW capacity, are ideal as a back-up power system for hospitals and businesses, or a power provider for off-grid locations such as construction and mine sites.
“The H2X generators are ideally suited to replace standard petrol or diesel generators, allowing you to switch to an emission-free hydrogen fuel cell operation,” he said.

The sale of the demonstration model was overseen by Sydney-based company Pure Hydrogen, which owns a 23% stake in H2X Global.
“This power generation unit has at its heart, a hydrogen fuel cell and a powertrain that have been developed over several years,” Pure Hydrogen managing director Scott Brown said.
“This technology is at the forefront of the hydrogen revolution, and it is great to see it being implemented commercially.”
ASX-listed Pure Hydrogen expects to receive about $55,000 from the sale of the generator and supply of hydrogen in the first year.
While the transaction is the first sale of a Power H2 unit in Australia, H2X said it has sold generator units into Malaysia and to buyers in the Netherlands. The company said it is currently gaining the required certification for the generator to allow its sale for public use.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/01/cec-warns-labour-and-skills-shortages-threaten-clean-energy-transition/,"EMPLOYMENT,POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2022",CEC warns labour and skills shortages threaten clean energy transition,"The Clean Energy Council (CEC) has warned that Australia’s capacity to deliver on its transition to a clean energy future is at risk unless the current and growing labour shortages and skills gaps across the renewables industry are filled.
Ahead of the two-day national jobs and skills summit which begins in Canberra today, the CEC has published a report calling for government, industry, the tertiary education sector, and professional associations to work together to address the labour challenges it said could throttle the success of Australia’s clean energy transition.
“This is the key decade, not only for Australia’s emissions reduction efforts but also in developing the workforce to drive this economy-wide change,” CEC chief executive Kane Thornton said.
“Now is the time to take stock and put in place measures to ensure that people and jobs are a focus of Australia’s clean energy transition.”
Over the past decade, the share of renewable electricity generation in Australia has doubled, rising from 15% in 2013 to 33% in 2021. With the Senate expected to pass Australia’s legislated 43% by 2030 and net zero by 2050 emissions reduction targets later this month, that growth is destined to accelerate.
In the Skilling the Energy Transition report published this week, the CEC said the transition to a clean energy future presents an enormous opportunity but comes at a time where the existing workforce is “riddled with challenges, gaps, and unmet demand from industry”.
The report makes six recommendations, including coordinating higher education to meet clean energy industries’ interests, positioning vocational educational and training to respond to industry needs, and establishing pathways to attract international workers.
The report also recommends the establishment of a transition authority to work with government to support and coordinate local efforts and community-led initiatives, and to map career pathways into emerging sectors within each region.
“The clean energy sector needs policy, and therefore investment, certainty, clear targets, strong leadership and genuine collaboration,” the CEC said.

The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has outlined the case for building 141 GW of large-scale wind and solar capacity, 63 GW of storage and hydro capacity, and 69 GW of small-scale solar and household batteries needed by 2050 to maintain reliability and keep prices down. This represents a ninefold increase in large-scale renewable generation installed in the National Electricity Market and a fivefold increase in small-scale generation.
“Delivering this transformation will require an enormous number of workers,” Thornton said.
The CEC said the Australian clean energy industry currently employs about 30,000 people across large-scale renewable energy construction, operation and maintenance, and small-scale rooftop solar design and installation. Modelling suggests that the ongoing rollout of renewables could see 604,000 additional direct and indirect jobs created by 2030.
Electrical Trades Union (ETU) acting national secretary Michael Wright said with the Australian clean energy sector preparing for a period of extraordinary growth and development, prioritising the skills and training of energy workers and tomorrow’s trades is vital for the national interest.
“This report shows that investing in a secure, skilled and well-trained workforce is the first step towards powering Australia’s future,” he said.
“It’s the absolute foundation of the pathway to meet climate targets and reduce emissions.”
The jobs and skills summit will bring together representatives from politics, unions, business, and key community groups. All ideas will be fed into an employment white paper to be published in the next 12 months.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/01/polysilicon-price-relief-in-2023-as-industry-scales-to-500-gw/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2022",Polysilicon price relief in 2023 as industry scales to 500 GW,"From pv magazine USA
The China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association said last week that polysilicon prices touched US$45.47/kg (AU$66.25), before settling a bit lower. This is an increase of more than 600% from the low pricing of under US$7/kg (AU10.2/kg) seen in the second quarter of 2020.
It takes about 3 grams of raw polysilicon to create each watt of a solar panel, so a 400 W residential solar panel uses 1.2 kg of polysilicon. The largest panels – 700 W utility-scale modules – use 2.1 kg. The 700 W utility-scale panel contains US$90 of polysilicon.
Spot market prices are likely much higher than the prices being paid in long-term contracts. The cost of polysilicon inputs hasn’t risen nearly to the same heights, so companies that produce their own polysilicon are actually paying much less for their input costs. Multiple parties have suggested that the industry should see significant volumes of polysilicon manufacturing come online as the year ends, which would lead to decreases in pricing starting in 2023.
Clean Energy Associates (CEA), in its PV Price Forecasting Program Q2 2022 report, said “significant expansions among ingot and wafer suppliers are expected to create a competitive market scene when these suppliers can once again source lower-priced polysilicon.” It said that by the end of 2022, the world will have approximately 285 GW of polysilicon manufacturing capacity online.
While the executive preview version of the report does not share future polysilicon pricing, CEA does suggest that the average 2022 wafer pricing of US$0.13/W could fall by as much as 23% by the end of 2023. This implies that polysilicon pricing could fall by roughly US$10 per kg. BloombergNEF recently suggested that by the end of 2023, there will be enough polysilicon manufacturing facilities to supply 500 GW of solar modules.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/01/solaredge-under-investigation-for-alleged-patent-violations/,"INVERTERS,LEGAL,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2022",SolarEdge under investigation for alleged patent violations,"From pv magazine USA
Ampt, a power electronics specialist based in Colorado, has filed a lawsuit against SolarEdge, a major player in the power electronics space, for allegedly violating its patents.
The company said that SolarEdge violated patents on “power optimisers that contain high-efficiency power converters that both allow maximum power-point output and use operational boundary conditions that continue producing power during conditions that might otherwise require the optimiser to be bypassed.”
Now, the US International Trade Commission (ITC) has accepted the complaint from Ampt, and will launch an investigation into the alleged patent infringement. The ITC set a target of 45 days from the announced investigation to complete the review. Ampt is seeking a ban on imports of SolarEdge products as well as a ban on the sale of such products in the United States after they are imported.
Ampt string optimisers have two inputs and one output back to the inverter. The string optimisers are located between the PV source circuits and the combiner box on a PV system. The optimiser performs MPP tracking on each input and delivers full available power to the output at a voltage set by the inverter. This is done without requiring communication between the inverter and optimisers.
“We appreciate the commission’s decision to investigate SolarEdge’s unlawful use of our proprietary technology without asking our permission or compensating us,” said Levent Gun, Ampt’s chief executive officer.
Ampt has also filed a patent infringement action involving claims from eight of its US patents in the US District Court in Delaware against SolarEdge seeking a finding of patent infringement, substantial monetary damages and an injunction.
“SolarEdge and Ampt have been litigating a dispute involving a patent family filed by SolarEdge and a patent family filed by Ampt before the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for many years,” SolarEdge told pv magazine. “Recently, the USPTO awarded priority of invention to SolarEdge, canceled the claims of Ampt’s patents, and awarded the patent claims in these Ampt patents to SolarEdge. It appears that having lost before the USPTO, Ampt is now shopping around its claims to other courts. SolarEdge anticipates a vigorous defence of these new cases.” 
SolarEdge, along with other players in the solar industry, is expected to grow significantly following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes record spending for renewable energy technologies. JP Morgan recently increased its 12-month share price target for the company from US$373 to US$419. The target implies a 51% increase from its current share price of US$277.
