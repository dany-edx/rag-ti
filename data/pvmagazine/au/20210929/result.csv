In July, AVL was awarded a $3.69 million federal government grant which it says will allow it to design, build and operate a $7.4 million commercial vanadium battery electrolyte plant as well as develop vanadium redox flow battery prototypes for both off-grid and residential settings. Conditions of the grant dictate the manufacturing project must be fully completed by March 31, 2024.

Shortly after being awarded the grant, AVL signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with specialty chemical producer U.S. Vanadium LLC (USV) for the supply of vanadium oxides and, perhaps more importantly, gives AVL an exclusive technology licence for Australia and New Zealand to use USV’s proven electrolyte manufacturing technology.
This, the company says, will “simplifying design, construction, and startup” of its future manufacturing plant. The goal with the plant, AVL’s managing director Vincent Algar said, is to “cement” AVL’s downstream processing capability here in Australia.

While this plan has only just entered its first stage, the company is far more progressed with the vanadium mine its establishing in Gabanintha, almost smack bang in the middle of Western Australia. The Australian Vanadium Project, as its called, has been awarded Major Project Status by the federal government.
There are currently just a handful of vanadium mines operating in the world, with Australia home to some of the world’s biggest untapped deposits. AVL’s managing director Vincent Algar told pv magazine Australia in July that Western Australia “easily dominate the battery supply chain for vanadium inside and outside Australia.”

The company is pursuing these two avenues, mining and manufacturing, as part of its vision of vertically integrate the business and “value add” – moving from Australia’s traditional role of simply extracting and exporting raw minerals to instead creating products from those materials onshore, which typically has far higher profit margins. 
AVL plans to supply vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) from the Australian Vanadium Project to manufacture vanadium electrolyte which will then be supplied to VRFB projects in Australia and in the Asia Pacific Region.
The manufacturing facility will start on a scale producing enough electrolyte per annum to fill vanadium redox flow batteries capable of storing 33 MWh. “For comparison, a single Tesla Powerwall stores 13.5 kWh of energy, with the electrolyte plant producing the equivalent energy storage capacity of 2,444 Powerwalls per year,” AVL’s statement said.

In Parts 1 and 2 of this series, pv magazine reviewed the productive lifespan of residential solar panels, and inverters. Here, we examine home batteries, how well they perform over time, and how long they last.
Residential energy storage has become an increasingly popular feature of home solar. A recent SunPower survey of more than 1,500 households found that about 40% of Americans worry about power outages on a regular basis. Of the survey respondents actively considering solar for their homes, 70% said they planned to include a battery energy storage system.
Besides providing backup power during outages, many batteries are integrated with technology that allows for intelligent scheduling of the import and export of energy. The idea here is to maximise the value of the home’s solar system. And, some batteries are optimised to integrate an electric vehicle charger.
Although deployment of energy storage is on a steady climb, attachment rates of batteries remain low: in 2020 8.1% of residential solar systems attached batteries, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL).
Many options exist with multiple battery chemistries available for home energy storage. Bottom line, however, is that in the United States two brands dominate the space. More than 90% of the market is served by LG Chem and Tesla Powerwall, which are lithium-ion batteries, according to LBL. Tesla has more than 60% of the entire market share.
The Tesla PowerWall has a limited warranty that says the device will be free from defects for 10 years following installation. It also warrants that the PowerWall will start its life with a capacity of 13.5 kWh, and will retain energy capacity based on a degradation schedule.
LG warrants that its system will retain at least 60% of its nominal energy capacity (9.8 kWh) for 10 years. The battery must operate between -10 degrees Celsius and 45 degrees Celsius to remain warranted. Total throughput of energy within the warranty is limited to 27.4 MWh.
Solar installer Sunrun said batteries can last anywhere between 5-15 years. That means a replacement likely will be needed during the 20-30 year life of a solar system.
Battery life expectancy is mostly driven by usage cycles. As demonstrated by the LG and Tesla product warranties, thresholds of 60% or 70% capacity are warranted through a certain number of charge cycles.

Two use-scenarios drive this degradation: over charge and trickle charge, said the Faraday Institute. Overcharge is the act of pushing current into a battery that is fully charged. Doing this can cause it to overheat, or even potentially catch fire.
Trickle charge involves a process in which the battery is continually charged up to 100%, and inevitably losses take place. The bounce between 100% and just under 100% can elevate internal temperatures, diminishing capacity and lifetime.
Another cause of degradation over time is the loss of mobile lithium-ions in the battery, said Faraday. Side reactions in the battery can trap free usable lithium, thereby lowering capacity gradually.
While cold temperatures can halt a lithium-ion battery from performing, they do not actually degrade the battery or shorten its effective life. Overall battery lifetime is, however, diminished at high temperatures, said Faraday. This is because the electrolyte that sits between the electrodes breaks down at elevated temperatures, causing the battery to lose its capacity for Li-ion shuttling. This can reduce the number of Li-ions the electrode can accept into its structure, depleting the lithium-ion battery capacity.
It is recommended by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to install a battery in a cool, dry place, preferably a garage, where the impact of a fire (a small, but non-zero threat) may be minimised. Batteries and components around them should have proper spacing to allow cooling, and regular maintenance check-ups can be helpful in ensuring optimal operation.
NREL said that whenever possible, avoid repeated deep discharging of batteries, as the more it is discharged, the shorter the lifetime. If the home battery is discharged deeply every day, it may be time to increase the battery bank’s size.
Batteries in series should be kept at the same charge, said NREL. Though the entire battery bank may display an overall charge of 24 volts, there can be varied voltage among the batteries, which is less beneficial to protecting the entire system over the long run. Additionally, NREL recommended that the correct voltage set points are set for chargers and charge controllers, as determined by the manufacturer.
Inspections should occur frequently, too, said NREL. Some things to look for include leakage (buildup on the outside of the battery), appropriate fluid levels, and equal voltage. NREL said each battery manufacturer may have additional recommendations, so checking maintenance and data sheets on a battery is a best practice.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/29/nsw-to-halve-emissions-by-2030-injecting-transformative-37-billion-into-clean-energy/,"EV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2021","NSW to halve emissions by 2030, injecting ‘transformative’ $37 billion into clean energy","The New South Wales government today released an update on its plan to get to net zero, describing itself as “on track” to halve emissions by 2030 – leading it to formally increase its target from 35% to 50% emissions reduction compared with 2005 levels.
By setting clear plans for its emissions reduction journey, the state is hoping to send signals to clean energy investors and is expecting its policies to attract more than $37 billion in private investment. In fact, off the back of its new low-carbon leadership, New South Wales (NSW) is seeking to become Australia’s first trillion-dollar state within the decade.
The measures, introduced by state environment and energy minister Matt Kean, build on the 2020 plan to attract 12 GW of renewables and 2 GW of pumped hydro to NSW by 2030, part of its NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap.

The state’s The Net Zero Plan: Stage 1 Implementation Update was published this morning, and builds on the original Net Zero Plan from March, which set out visions for state’s renewable energy zones, electricity grids, electric vehicles, hydrogen, technology industries and more. “As a result of our policies, the state’s emissions are projected to fall by 47-52% on 2005 levels by 2030 under independently peer reviewed modelling,” Kean said in a statement today.
Such a dramatic drop would push NSW ahead of Victoria, which is currently targeting a 45-50% emissions reduction by 2030, putting it on par with South Australia, which has one of the most progressed electricity grids in terms of renewable penetration in the world.

The NSW government’s suite of climate-related plans focus heavily on attracting green investment, framing the state as the country’s future renewables haven.
“This is about putting the policies in place to give industry and investors certainty, not only to protect our planet but to future-proof our prosperity and way of life,” NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
The Clean Energy Council’s chief executive, Kane Thornton, applauded the move. “NSW has a solid plan to deliver emissions reduction with a clear energy policy and focus on renewable energy zones, recognising that firmed renewable generation is now the most cost-competitive way to generate power, reduce electricity bills and deliver jobs into regional NSW,” Thornton said.
He described the announcement of halving of emissions by 2030 “transformative”.

In addition to driving high-end investment, the government also believes the Net Zero plan will save NSW households around $130 on their electricity bills.
Importantly, its Implementation Update also outlines a commitment to disclose the state’s climate related financial risks and opportunities for the first time. A measure it says is now consistent with the Taskforce for Climate Related Financial Disclosures framework.
As Australia’s most populace state, NSW has its biggest economy – as well as the country’s largest coal-fired fleet. Nonetheless, the state’s Liberal government has powered ahead with its clean energy plans, even gaining the support of the notoriously climate action averse National Party.
With most of the clean energy investment set to be in the state’s regions, NSW Nationals leader and deputy premier John Barilaro has publicly supported the new targets, saying: “The entire state will benefit from the economic and employment opportunities in low-carbon technologies.
“Whether it is in modern manufacturing, minerals or agriculture, regional NSW is home to the skills, infrastructure and resources needed as the demand for low emissions technologies like batteries and hydrogen grows,” Barilaro said.

It seems Kean’s prudence in framing climate action as an economic driver rather than a threat to Australia’s way of life is enjoying widespread success. “Taking action on climate change does not come at a price to our prosperity – the fact is our state’s fortunes are tied to the fortunes of our planet,” Kean said in his foreword in the update.
This state level cooperation between the Liberal and National parties stands in stark contrast to the current federal situation, which has descended into fresh infighting between National leaders publicly opposing targets and inner-city moderate Liberals whose seats are now in jeopardy of being taken by climate-focussed independent candidates. 
It’s also worth noting the NSW Liberal party’s climate targets are now almost double those of their federal colleagues, who remain glued to just a 26% – 28% reduction in emissions by 2030, conceding only that net zero by 2050 would be “preferable”.
 
Australian Conservation Fund (ACF)
While the federal government’s targets are clearly not enough, it’s unclear if even the state’s more ambitious aims will cut the mustard. Kean seems to acknowledge this though, saying: “this plan should not be seen as the final word on emissions reduction between 2020 and 2030, but a foundation on which we will build.”
And the state’s building is indeed happening. From the beginning of this month, the NSW government began providing rebates and phasing out stamp duty for some electric vehicles (EVs) as part of its strategy to boost EV sales. It’s also committed to spending $171 million over the next four year on electric vehicle charging infrastructure as part of the plan, which will see almost half a billion invested in the technology in total.

Additionally, in September Kean told ABC’s Radio National that the state could “absolutely” phase out coal-fired generators by 2030. “We’ve got the biggest renewable energy plan that’s been legislated in the nation’s history right here in New South Wales, and that means as our coal fired power stations come to the end of their lives over the next years that will be replaced with renewables,” Kean said.
While Kean’s big vision has multiple components, it rests heavily on the development of the state’s five renewable energy zones (REZs). And the reaction to those has already been massive, with the state government revealing in August that more than 80 new solar, wind and energy storage projects, totalling a huge 34 GW, had been proposed for the New England renewable energy zone, Australia’s largest.

Mark Widmar, chief executive officer of US-based thin-film module manufacturer First Solar, has called the Indian government’s production-linked incentives scheme for solar ideal for manufacturers to come to India. The US manufacturer is hopeful of getting successful in receiving an award or a grant through the production-linked incentive scheme for high-efficiency solar module manufacturing. And will continue with its India plans whatever be the tender outcome.
Widmar said the Indian government’s approach of a strong balance between industrial policy as well as trade policy, makes it an ideal opportunity for companies like First Solar to establish manufacturing in India. The government has committed to ensuring domestic capabilities as it pursues long-term climate goals and objectives with focus on energy independence and security.
“I think the alignment of what the Indian government is trying to accomplish couldn’t be better for companies that are looking to manufacture in India,” said Widmar. “The environment is pro-business and there is more opportunity for us to be successful to help India achieve its goal of establishing [solar] manufacturing base. India is taking a leadership role on a global stage as far as renewable sources of energy are concerned.”
India has set ambitious RE targets of 175 GW by 2022 and 450 GW by 2030. The Government has taken a number of steps to enhance domestic manufacturing of solar PV cells and modules as it chases these goals. These include Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS) Scheme, production-linked incentive scheme for gigawatt-scale manufacturing of high-efficiency solar modules, preference to ‘Make in India’ in public procurement in renewable energy sector, imposition of basic customs duty on import of solar PV cells and modules with effect from April next year.
First Solar is planning a 3.3 GW vertically integrated thin-film solar module manufacturing facility in India. It has bid under the government’s production-linked incentives scheme.

Bouygues Energie & Services, a unit of French industrial conglomerate Bouygues, has built a solar-powered hydrogen facility at a site operated by the Bordeaux Area Control Centre (ACC) in Sarlat, in the Dordogne department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine in southwestern France.
Developed with the support of the Direction des Services de la navigation aérienne (DSNA), which is the French government agency responsible for air traffic control, communication and information, the Be Greener hydrogen pilot project is intended at powering the site’s radio communication antenna, which was previously operated through an off-grid power generator.
The system was built with two fuel cell systems with a capacity of 2.2 kW each, a 5 kW electrolyser, and lithium nickel-cobalt-aluminum oxide (NCA) batteries with a storage capacity of 23.4 kW.
The 19.8 kW PV system is used mainly to provide power directly to the antenna and, when it produces more energy than needed, the surplus is used to produce hydrogen which is then utilised to produce new electricity via a fuel cell system and provide power to the antenna during a period of up to five days.
If the energy needs to be stored for periods that are shorter than 24 hours, however, excess electricity can be stored in lithium-ion batteries for short-term storage. “The system is expected to reduce non-renewable primary energy consumption by 78% and greenhouse gas emissions by 79% compared to a conventional diesel generator solution,” said Caroline Mazzoleni, deputy director of smart energy at Bouygues Énergies & Services.
The system was constructed at a cost of €680,000, with the electrolyser and the fuel cell system requiring €110,000 and €180,000, respectively. Partners in the project were, French start-up PowiDian, and BG Consulting Engineers.
