Eneos, which earlier this year announced it would develop a 204 MW solar farm in western Queensland in partnership with fellow Japanese company Sojitz, is now looking to expand its renewable energy reach into South Australia.
In a statement, Eneos said it is looking to develop a large-scale supply of cost-competitive hydrogen and is striving to establish an international supply chain.
“As a part of these initiatives, Eneos plans to conduct a study for collaboration with a local company in Australia to build a supply chain for an affordable and stable supply of green hydrogen produced from renewable energy,” the company said.
“This will be achieved by utilizing Australia’s excellent potential for cost-competitive hydrogen production due to its favourable climate conditions, including wind and sunlight, and expansive land.”
The joint study will examine the potential for manufacturing green hydrogen from renewable-energy-derived power through water electrolysis in Australia.
The study will also look at the conversion of manufactured green hydrogen into methylcyclohexane (MCH), a form of efficient hydrogen storage and transport and the transporting of MCH to Japan by tankers.
Eneos expects its existing petroleum-related infrastructure, including tankers, storage tanks and dehydrogenation facilities, can be utilized in the hydrogen supply chain, enabling development of a new energy supply system while curbing new investment.

Neoen’s involvement in the joint study will include investigating the stable renewable energy supply and water electrolysis cells for hydrogen production.
The French company is one of the world’s leading independent renewable energy power producers and already has more than 2 GW of renewable energy generation in operation or under construction in Australia.
Its South Australia portfolio includes the $3bn Goyder South project which secured government approval earlier this year.
Neon has also received approval to develop the Crystal Brook Energy Park, another hybrid renewables + storage featuring 125 MW of wind, 150 MW of solar PV and 130 MW/400 MWh of lithium-ion battery storage.
“These projects combine wind, solar and battery storage to provide a firm renewable energy power supply, overcoming the limitations of wind or solar only projects,” Eneos said.
Eneos said the South Australia government’s support for renewable energy industries, including hydrogen, and the planned expansion of facilities at its leading port, also factored in its decision to target the state as the base for hydrogen export to Japan.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/06/aemo-white-paper-points-to-inverters-as-possible-path-to-100-renewables/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 6, 2021",AEMO ‘white paper’ points to inverters as possible path to 100% renewables,"The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has published a ‘white paper’ aiming to accelerate the introduction of grid-scale inverters to support Australia’s future power system as it transitions from synchronous generation towards inverter-based resources (IBR) such as solar PV, wind energy, and battery energy storage systems (BESS).
The Application of Advanced Grid-scale Inverters in the NEM paper outlines how the shift from synchronous generation towards IBR is changing the way the industry must plan for the secure operation of the National Electricity Market (NEM).
AEMO said this includes developing a power system capable of running at 100% instantaneous penetration of renewable energy, including grid-scale solar, wind, hydro and rooftop PV.
AEMO future energy systems manager Chris Davies said the engineering white paper focuses on the potential of advanced grid-scale inverter technology to support the operation of the NEM as the penetration of IBR increases, particularly through the use of grid-forming capabilities that can help stabilise the grid.
“The NEM is undergoing a once-in-a-lifetime transition from synchronous generation, such as thermal and hydro, to variable inverter-based renewable generation,” he said.
“When offline or decommissioned, synchronous generators can no longer provide the critical system stability capabilities that the grid relies on, requiring these capabilities be provided by different technologies.
“AEMO has been working with stakeholders to understand the potential of grid-forming inverters to address many of the challenges facing the future power system.”
The supply of electricity in the NEM has historically been dominated by large, fossil-fuel fired synchronous generators. The design of the NEM was based on the capabilities provided by synchronous generation but the network has undergone transformational change in its generation mix with IBR including wind and solar being deployed at a scale and pace not seen anywhere else in the world.

AEMO said some regions of the NEM are leading the world in demonstrating operation of a gigawatt-scale power system with low levels of synchronous generation. Figures provided by the market operator show South Australia and Tasmania have recorded periods with 93% and 82% IBR generation respectively.
While the generation mix in the NEM is changing, the physics that determine the grid’s secure operation remain the same, meaning the attributes provided by synchronous generation will continue to be required during periods of high IBR penetration.
Davies said advanced inverter technology may be able to address many of the challenges facing the NEM today for the integration of renewable resources but warned that at present this potential is not demonstrated at the necessary scale, and focused engineering development is urgently needed to address the remaining issues and realise the promise of this technology.
“To realise the potential of this technology, we need to quickly come together as an industry to prioritise the time and resources needed to prove this technology at scale and support an effective transition,” he said.
The paper identifies four key areas of application for advanced inverters, including connecting IBR in weak grids, supporting system security, island operation, and system restart.

Developed as part of AEMO’s Engineering Framework, the paper recommends prioritising the deployment of grid-forming capabilities on grid-scale battery energy storage systems, saying the technology provides capability to deliver firm, flexible energy behind the inverter.
AEMO said with a growing number of grid-scale batteries committed or proposed on the NEM, there is a rare window of opportunity to build grid-forming capabilities into this battery fleet today.
This would enable testing and demonstration of these capabilities at scale and begin to build a fleet that can support the power system as it transitions to high IBR penetrations.
While large, standalone BESS provide one way to deliver grid-forming capability, AEMO also suggested smaller batteries coupled to variable renewable energy (VRE) plant might also provide a flexible resource mix to cater for the applications described in the paper.
AEMO said further collaboration with stakeholders will be needed to develop effective pathways toward the application of advanced inverters and it will continue to work with industry to identify additional priority actions needed to prepare the future power system.

The Perry Bridge Solar Farm, a 44 MW solar PV and 50 MWh battery project, has already secured planning approval from the Victorian government while the planning process has commenced for the Fulham Solar Farm, a proposed 80 MW solar PV facility and 80 MWh battery energy storage system set to be developed about 12 kilometres west of Sale.
Octopus Australia and the CEFC have purchased the rights to develop the projects from Melbourne-based management team Solis Renewable Energy which, along with Gippsland-based Marathon Electrical and construction firm WK & MA Ferguson, is part of the  Repowering Gippsland joint venture.
Octopus Australia’s head of investment and development, Dennis Freedman, said the three parties will be working closely together to bring the projects to financial close.
“They have a vision for their region and we are excited to work alongside them to turn it into reality,” he said.
Victoria’s Gippsland region has a rich history in energy generation, producing approximately 85% of the state’s electricity but it is undergoing a transition due to the decline of coal-based generation.
Octopus Australia’s Managing Director Sam Reynolds said with the early retirement of the Yallourn coal-fired power station having been announced recently, the Perry Bridge and Fulham developments form part of the suite of new energy generation that will be required to replace the asset.
Reynolds said the projects offer an exciting new pathway for the Gippsland community to benefit from the clean energy economy.
“Gippsland has its roots in the electricity industry, and these projects help the region continue that journey,” he said.
“As the first renewable energy projects to be built at scale in the region, the Perry Bridge and Fulham solar farms symbolise how the region can be transformed into a green energy powerhouse for the 21st century.”
Octopus Australia is a subsidiary of the United Kingdom-based Octopus Group, self-described as one of the world’s largest investors in clean energy with more than $6 billion deployed across more than 250 projects.

The Perry Bridge and Fulham solar farms will bolster its Australian portfolio which already includes joint ownership of the 275 MW Darlington Point Solar Farm in western New South Wales, currently the largest solar farm generating into the National Electricity Market (NEM).
The development, construction and operation of the Perry Bridge and Fulham solar farms is expected to create more than 250 direct jobs during the construction period.
The projects are also expected to showcase the ability of sheep grazing and solar farming to co-exist, providing a diversified revenue stream to local landholders.
Reynolds said the experience of the CEFC would be crucial to the successful delivery of the two projects.
“Through its investments, the CEFC has helped Australia’s renewable energy sector achieve rapid growth in recent years, delivering substantial amounts of clean energy across Australia,” he said.
“This experience will be critical as we develop these renewable energy assets for Gippsland.”
CEFC executive director Monique Miller said the ongoing investment in new, clean generation, storage, transmission and infrastructure is critical to support the security and reliability of Australia’s energy grid.

Associate Professor Ziv Hameiri has secured $530,000 to develop an Australian-made inspection system for next-generation solar PV cells.
The system is expected to allow for fast measurements of large-size tandem solar cells for the first time and will also help determine key parameters that can’t be measured by current methods.
The system’s capability is expected to generate new knowledge in the areas of perovskite and tandem solar cells.
The UNSW said the project will improve the quality of advanced solar PV cells and enhance Australia’s capabilities in building sophisticated characterisation instruments.
The research team said the project could lead to cheaper solar energy and the development of a local inspection industry.
Almost $590,000 has been allocated to develop a long-life, stable, high-performing and green chalcopyrite solar-powered building steel.
It’s expected the steel will be a truly green building integrated PV (BIPV) product for building deployment.
It is anticipated the project, to be led by Associate Professor Xiaojing Hao, will help accelerate the transition to the zero-emission building and establish Australia’s excellence in green steel for BIPV.

Dr Michael Nielsen will receive just over $417,000 to develop nonlinear optical metrology of electronic interfaces for silicon devices in partnership with Femtometrix.
The quality of these silicon-dielectric interfaces, which are affected by trapped charges and defects, are critical for microelectronic and optoelectronic device manufacturing.
It’s hoped the SPREE project will improve a technology which could be useful for the development of new PV materials.
The three UNSW projects are among 67 new research projects which received a total $31.7 million in the latest round of the Australian Research Council’s (ARC) Linkage Project Grants scheme.
ARC chief executive Professor Sue Thomas said the scheme brings together higher education and industry to conduct research and development which is fundamental to transforming industries.
“The Linkage Projects scheme is about encouraging collaboration between researchers, industries and communities to find solutions to real, everyday challenges and issues,” she said.
“It’s about bringing together the scientists in our research institutions with those who can apply the outcomes of research to create meaningful outcomes that benefit the Australian community.”

Meanwhile, researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) will focus on making solar modules more accessible for renters after securing funding in the latest round of Energy Consumers Australia’s (ECA) Grants Program.
With Australians who live in rental properties seven times less likely to have rooftop solar, researchers from ANU have been granted $77,070 to discover and advise on what policies will best address the discrepancy.
ECA chief executive Lynne Gallagher said she sees huge value in the ANU research project and the ability it has to fill a gap in the policy-making sector’s knowledge.
“Renters are a cohort who have often been excluded from achieving the benefits of rooftop solar: greater energy independence, cheaper bills, and lowered emissions,” she said.
”We need to better understand the policy interventions that can address this gap, and this project is set to provide that knowledge in a highly collaborative way.”

A Vietnamese-Korean research group has developed a four-terminal perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell with a special bifacial configuration for albedo reflection. The cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 30.09% (taking into account the rear side performance).
The tandem device was built with a bifacial crystalline silicon perovskite-filtered heterojunction sub-cell, which the scientists described as able to absorb the solar spectrum from both the front and rear sides and achieve a significant enhancement compared with semitransparent amorphous silicon sub-cells, as it absorbs all solar spectra in the short-wavelength range.
The perovskite used in the sub-cell is methylammonium-lead (ΙΙ) iodide (CH3NH3PbI3). The hole and electron transport layers were developed with nickel(II) oxide (NiO) and PCBM, which is a solubilised version of the buckminsterfullerene C60, respectively.  The NiO was deposited through an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, while spin coating was used to coat the PCBM on the absorber layer. Commercial Czochralski-grown n-type crystalline silicon wafers with a thickness of 200 microns were utilised for the heterojunction cell. Layers of the amorphous silicon were grown on the cell via plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition in a cluster system.
The researchers explained that in a traditional four-terminal perovskite/silicon configuration, the solar spectrum in the short-wavelength range is absorbed by the perovskite top sub-cell, while the remaining light is absorbed by the silicon heterojunction sub-cell beneath. “However, not all photons corresponding to bottom sub-cell’s optical bandgap can be yielded,” they further explained.
In the proposed cell configuration, the bifaciality increases the number of absorbed photons. “As a result, short-circuit current and the conversion efficiency of the crystalline silicon heterojunction bottom sub-cell improved from ~ 15.15 to 33.5 mA/cm2 and from 8.68 to 12.99%, respectively, when the albedo reflection increased from 0 to 0.5 sun,” the academics stated. “The albedo reflection intensity can be accurately adjusted in the range of 0–0.5 sun by altering the distance between the cell holder and illumination source.”
This efficiency increase was able to raise the cell’s overall efficiency (including light reflected to the rear side) from 25.78 to 30.09%. The solar cell is presented in the paper Over 30% efficiency bifacial 4-terminal perovskite-heterojunction silicon tandem solar cells with spectral albedo, published in scientific reports. The research group comprises scientists from the Incheon National University and the Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) in South Korea, as well as the National University and the Ton Duc Thang University in Vietnam.
“This approach achieved a conversion efficiency exceeding 30%, which is higher than those of both the top and bottom sub-cells,” reads the study. “Notably, this efficiency is also greater than the Schockley–Quiesser limit of the single-junction c-Si solar cell (approximately 29.43%).”

The reaction has not been faint-hearted. 
What happened?
The Senate blocked the Morrison government’s previous attempt to illegally siphon finds away from ARENA two months ago. But last Friday, the Taylor made a renewed attempt at shifting the remit of ARENA to include fossil-fuel related technologies including carbon capture and storage (CCS) and hydrogen generated by fossil-fuels. 
“From today,” said Taylor in a statement, “new regulations take effect that broaden ARENA’s mandate to enable the agency to play an important role in stimulating investment that will help achieve the Technology Investment Roadmap stretch goals as well as energy efficiency measures.” 
Of course, this is not the first nor even the second time a Coalition government has tried to rout ARENA. In 2014 the government tried to scrap ARENA altogether, and in 2016 $500 million in ARENA’s funding was cut. 
The reaction
The Climate Council reacted strongly to the Senate’s maintenance of the government’s controversial changes. Climate Councillor, former ARENA chair, and former president of BP Australasia, Greg Bourne, said “the Federal government’s latest move has sullied ARENA by allowing it to invest in CCS as well as hydrogen made with gas. This retrograde step will prop up fossil fuels using taxpayer money.”
“The nation’s renewable energy agency should not be spending money earmarked for renewables on CCS technology,” continued Bourne. “If any investment is made, it should be paid for by the fossil fuel industry. CCS is expensive, unlikely to be effective, and the industry has always over-promised and under-delivered.” 
The same goes for hydrogen produced from gas, said Bourne, for “gas has no place in Australia’s zero emissions future. Only hydrogen made with renewable energy is worth investing in, as customers demand ‘green hydrogen’ in a decarbonising global economy.” 
Instead, says Bourne, the government should be accelerating efforts to scale up and improve renewables and battery storage as climate solutions and job creators. 
Just over a month ago, Greens, Xbench & Labor united to say there's no place for coal or gas in the Renewable Energy Agency.
Public money should go to saving our climate, public schools & hospitals, not coal & gas.
Now, Libs are trying to break ARENA again. We won’t let them.
— Adam Bandt (@AdamBandt) August 3, 2021

What is more, John Grimes, Smart Energy Council (SEC) chief executive, told AAP that the energy industry body representing thousands of companies, may sue the Morrison government for this (yet another) blatant attempt to subvert the energy transition and prolong the obsolescence of fossil fuels. 
Australian Solar Council
“Our sector is now at the point where if you just roll over on these things it’s just never ending,” said Grimes. “This has been an ideological attack from the outset and you’ve just got to call it for what it is.” 
Grimes is ready to take the government to court. “It contravenes the Act, the Act is really clear about the definition of renewable energy,” Grimes continued. “We are absolutely right now talking to legal representatives and our intention is if it has a good prospect of success we would launch legal action.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/06/novel-plant-design-for-agrivoltaics-improves-yield/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 6, 2021",Novel plant design for agrivoltaics improves yield,"From pv magazine Global
A group of researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China has developed a special design for agrivoltaic projects that, compared to other approaches, is claimed to reduce the shading effect of the PV installation and improve crops’ light environment and the crop growth process, yield and quality.
“The system has a cost that is 10% higher than conventional agrivoltaic project, but the improved crop yield ensured by the optimised lighting management would compensate for this slightly higher investment,” research co-author, Jan Ingenhoff, told pv magazine.
In terms of economic feasibility, a system developed with the proposed approach should be built at a cost of approximately €715 (AU$1145) per kW installed and a yearly cost for maintenance of about €6.5 (AU$10) per kW.
Called Even-lighting Agrivoltaic System (EAS), the novel design methodology consists of utilising metal brackets as mounting structures, conventional solar panels, and a grooved glass plate placed between the solar panels. The latter occupies an area that is one-third of the light-receiving area of the entire system. “With the installation of the glass plate, the density of PV panel arrays is the same as conventional photovoltaic power stations and very close to the optimum design for energy production,” the scientists affirmed.
According to Ingenhoff, any regular glass with a high transmission coefficient can be used, as there are no special requirements, and silicate glass and ultra-white glass may be perfectly suitable.
The metal brackets are placed on columns that are high enough to allow the growth of tall plants and the use of big agricultural machinery. The optimum tilt angle for modules was determined at 23 degrees, which the research group described as a good compromise between electricity generation and construction costs.
The scientists initially calculated and simulated optically the design of the grooved glass plate and then built a first pilot 35 kW agrivoltaic project in Fuyang city, in China’s Anhui province. Common vegetables such as lettuce, broccoli, garlic sprouts, garlic, rapeseed, Jerusalem artichoke, among others, were then planted.
A second pilot system was deployed more recently in Hefei city, in the same Chinese province.
The EAS system provided improved growing conditions for some plants. For example, the Jerusalem artichoke harvest increased by over 20%. The reason behind this may be due to better soil moisture retained within the facility area, or that the plant can remain under photosynthesis between 11:00 and 2:00 pm in good sun radiation days, which is typically entering a dormant state for the plant outside, as leaf photosynthesis reaches a maximum in the late morning.
For both facilities, the height at which the solar panels were placed was 2.5 meters. Some of the plants also grew under the system equipped with supplementary LED lamps powered by the solar panels, which provided plants an extra 2 h light time every day compared to other treatments.
“The comprehensive economic benefits of EAS consist of the installation and maintenance costs, the electricity generation benefits and the crops harvest benefits,” the academics explained. “To accurately evaluate the comprehensive benefits of planting different crops, we considered the time required to plant different crops and the amount of electricity generated by the PV panels during the crop growth.”
According to their measurements, the use of the transparent grooved glass plate improved the irradiation collected by crops in one day by 47.38% compared to a conventional system, and the yield of Jerusalem artichoke, which needs at least six hours of sun a day, improved by 23%.
Including solar power generation, the system has shown that a farmer’s average income increases by 5.14 times and performed a high land equivalent ratio (LER), which is the measure the productivity and effectiveness of intercropping. It also improved the economic benefits on the farmland per hectare.
“Under the EAS, crops grew fast, and the yield was similar or better than that under the natural state,” the Chinese group noted. “By adding supplementary LED lamps into the EAS, the soluble sugar content of lettuce increased by 72.14% and the nitrate content of lettuce decreased by 21.51%.”
More details on the system design can be found in the paper Increasing the comprehensive economic benefits of farmland with Even-lighting Agrivoltaic Systems, published in Plos One.
