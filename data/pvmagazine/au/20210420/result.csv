He decided to no longer offer string inverters. Instead, his boutique company, Pentrith Solar, would only install solar systems with the less common and more expensive microinverters.
The switch garnered a number unforeseen responses. Firstly, the company’s conversion rate – the amount of enquiries which turn to actual sales – increased. “We’re actually getting less price objections,” Warner told pv magazine Australia, “the opposite to what I expected.”
Trouble, it seems, has come from an entirely different source. “The biggest thing I’ve found difficult to handle is, we’re still servicing string inverters,” Warner explained. The issue is that when past customers discover the company has stopped offering string inverters, they’re left feeling lumped with a subpar product. “I didn’t really think about it, but I do have to think about how that makes people feel.”
Warner is quick to clarify that he isn’t trying to wage any wars on string inverters. “This is not about rubbishing string inverters. If that’s what you can afford at the time, that’s fine.”
“Coal is the opposition here, not other solar companies and not string inverters,” he said.
Penrith Solar
Founded in 2017, Penrith Solar averages about six installs every day. The company doesn’t use subcontractors at all, instead providing customers follow up support through its in-house service team.
Stemming from that commitment, the company recently undertook an internal audit looking at
how often its team was called to service solar systems with microinverters compared to those with string inverters. What he found was stark: his team were eight times less likely to be called to fix microinverters than they were string inverters.
“This is just our own study,” Warner qualified. “In our experience, we found [microinverters] to be eight times more reliable.”
Specifically, Penrith Solar has been using Enphase’s IQ range (including the IQ 7, IQ7+ and IQ7 A), and Warner noted that his findings are particular to those products. He found just four failures among the 13,000 microinverters Penrith Solar has installed, according to its internal audit. “We’ve had a tremendously low amount of failures.”
It wasn’t only that Warner has found microinverters to be substantially more reliable, he also thinks they are easier to manage from a warehouse perspective. Instead of having to stock a range of string inverters to fit different system sizes, Warner now just orders one microinverter for every panel coming into his stockroom.
The third factor that swayed Warner was the safety. He says his in-house service team get called out to DC isolator fires weekly. “It sucks, but we’re almost used to it,” Warner said. “It doesn’t even surprise us anymore.” Some clients don’t even realise there has been a fire, according to him, but when his team look at the isolator, they’ve found it burned. “It’s pretty bad.”

While Penrith Solar has been installing microinverters on solar systems for a number of years, the decision to use them exclusively is relatively new. Which is to say, while the company’s conversion rate has increased in the last two months, it may be more symptomatic of Australian’s eagerness to install solar following the pandemic.
Rather than drawing conclusions from the fluctuating rate, Warner is relying on his interactions with customers, who he says have been exceedingly receptive of microinverters value proposition.
Warner has a home-spun theory which he says explains the warm reception, he calls it cost bandwidth.
“When you ask a consumer what they expect to pay for a 6.6 kW system, their response is somewhere from $2,500 to $6,600. They rarely expect to pay more than $1 per watt for a string inverter.
“Now when you start talking about microinverters, the client doesn’t expect to get that for $2,500. The client’s mindset starts at about $6,500 and ends somewhere around $10,000 – that’s around where they think is reasonable.”
On the boutique end of the spectrum, a string inverter solar system installed by Penrith Solar used to come in at around $6,900. Its systems fitted with microinverters, on the other hand, start at $7,700.
“So with string inverters, [Penrith Solar] are not in that price bandwidth. But with micro-inverters, we’re well and truly within the clients expectations.”
It’s led the company to have less price objections, with customers overwhelmingly understanding the added value offered microinverter’s ability to monitor both panels and consumption, as well as their longevity.
It’s important to note here that solar companies typically charge around 30% more for systems with microinverters, but Penrith Solar have now managed to get this figure down to about 10% through increased installation efficiency. Which means that while its microinverter systems are still more expensive than its string inverters were, the price difference is less than half of many of its competitors.

While Warner has found little price pushback, he admits he underestimated the severity of hurt feelings.
When we spoke, Warner had just left an inspection for a 90 kW system to be fitted at the business of one of his past residential customers. “The client said to me, ‘how come we’re not using string inverters? We did that on my house, remember?” Warner then had to explain Penrith Solar had stopped offering string inverters, even though he had installed a system on the man’s house with them. “I had to handle his emotions on site, which were – he felt, not betrayed, but wondered if he got the best value for money.”
“I had to explain to him how much the price difference was when he bought his system, and remind him of the saving he’s actually getting right now, as well as informing him that in today’s market, microinverters are the best choice for [his business].”
This delicate juggle between continuing to advocate for the value of string inverters while pitching discontinuing their use has, for Warner, been the hardest part of the transition.
Warner said Penrith Solar is the only company he knows of which has decided to exclusively install microinverters, though he could name a number of other solar companies he believes are using them for a majority of installs.
In terms of other companies operating in Western Sydney and the Blue Mountains, Warner said he has already seen them follow suit and gearing towards microinverter systems. “We’ve done the research for them. We know that it [microinverters] fail less.”
“I’m not saying [microinverters are] always going to be the best choice – there may be in the future something else – 2025, who knows – but right now, with the ammunition and knowledge I have today and the in-field experience, [microinverters] are the best on the market,” Warner said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/20/hydrogen-plant-in-sa-would-already-return-millions-in-profit-research-finds/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 20, 2021","Hydrogen plant in SA would already return millions in profit, research finds","If a hydrogen production plant were already up and running this summer in Australia’s renewable energy powerhouse, South Australia, it would have returned a profit of $2.3 million, according to research by Cornwall Insight Australia.
The analysis comes just days after South Australia’s Liberal government signed a $1 billion-plus energy deal with Morrison’s federal government that has a disconcerting focus on gas extraction as a primary grid stabiliser.  The plan hypes gas production and downplays renewable-energy benefits, though a number of important clean-energy-boosting projects also got a funding leg up through the deal.
The state’s Labor opposition, on the other hand, is already focussing on hydrogen, unveiling a $220 million plan in March for a hydrogen production, storage and electricity generation facility, including a 250 MWe of hydrogen electrolyser. The plan also included $31 million for 3,600 tonnes of liquefied hydrogen storage and $342 million for a 200 MW combined-cycle power plant power station. Labor’s plan might just prove lucrative, according to Cornwall.
“Our research shows that if such a plant were in operation at the stated capital costs, it could be profitable,” Senior Storage Consultant at Cornwall Insight Australia, Benjamin Macey, said.
In fact, Cornwall found it could have been profitable to the tune of $47 million in the case of 2020’s summer, given the hydrogen could be sold in line with the government’s goal of $2 per kilogram. This figure, however, is starkly different to the modelled outcome if a hydrogen plant had been operational in the summer Q1 of 2019, in which case Cornwall found it would be suffered a $2.3 million loss.
Cornwall based its analysis a 20% utilisation and included repayments, interest, operating costs and the net cost of energy in its modelling.
“In addition at the 20% utilisation factor, approximately 1,517 tonnes of hydrogen would have been effectively produced. This also could have been stored in the proposed storage facility,” Macey added.
“It should be noted that the financing arrangements using government debt make the project viable and would be difficult to finance on a commercial basis without a clear off-take market and incentive to invest.
“If Australia is to compete globally in hydrogen exports, governments will need to assist the industry and be a first mover. Similarities can be made to the support government has given to battery storage. We estimate there is now over 1 GW of battery projects proposed in South Australia with at least seven virtual power plants in operation.”
Cornwall did not take into account the potential value added from job creation, economic growth and supporting the transition to cleaner fuels in its commercial business case.

The loan will see innovative distributed energy generation models installed at Rubix Connect Estate in Victoria and the Horsley Park Estate in New South Wales with onsite solar, battery storage and a biodiesel generator.
Frasers Property energy retailer Real Utilities will provide also provide carbon neutral electricity to the properties’ common areas and its tenants.
Of the loan, $75 million was provided through the Australian government’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC). CEO of the corporation, Ian Learmonth, highlighted the potentially positive ramifications for industrial property development following from Frasers Property’s plans. “This new model has the potential to revolutionise energy use in industrial property,” Learmonth said in a statement.
It is understood Frasers Property plans to introduce a range of sustainability features in addition to solar and energy storage, including  passive design, LED lighting with advanced controls, energy monitoring systems and building electrification.
The sustainability linked loan marks Frasers Property’s fifteenth green financing credit since 2018. As of December 2020, the development group had secured sustainability linked financing totalling AU$3.8 billion.
This $300 million loan was awarded to incentivise sustainable practices and has a reducing pricing structure with interest cost reduction from the second year onwards if Frasers Property’s subsidiaries maintain a four-star rating or above in each of their Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarks.
In 2020, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency chipped in over $700,000 to help Frasers Property Australia build 51 energy efficient homes complete with a solar embedded network. The idea is to demonstrate to the wider housing sector that energy efficient homes can be built at scale and be cost-effective to the customer.
Frasers Property Group states on its website that it has installed 13.69 MW of solar PV across its portfolio, which includes both residential and industrial developments.
The group’s Australian branch has set a target to be net zero carbon by 2028.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/20/wa-green-hydrogen-project-grows-from-1-gw-to-8-gw-following-commitment-from-french-powerhouse/,"HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,FRANCE,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 20, 2021","WA green hydrogen project grows from 1 GW to 8 GW, following commitment from French powerhouse","French company Total Eren, which is 30% owned by multinational oil and gas company Total SE, has signed a binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Western Australia company Province Resources, agreeing to complete a scoping study which could potentially lead to each company holding a 50% stake in the proposed HyEnergy Zero Carbon Hydrogen project.
The agreement marks a big step for Province, which originated as an gold and nickel exploration company and has only just entered the renewable energy game. Despite the excitement around its proposed HyEnergy project, which initially proposed installing 1 GW of hybrid solar and wind capacity to produce of 60,000 tons of green hydrogen per year, the company could hardly be considered a major player.
The backing of Total Eren, however, changes the game entirely. Total Eren has 3.3 GW of global renewable energy power plants around the world, and successfully developed, financed and constructed Victoria’s largest solar farm, Kiamal Solar Farm. It has a team of 20 renewable energy professionals in Australia.
Its support gives the HyEnergy project significantly more prowess, offering it far more robust financial backing and expertise. It has also seen ambition sky rocket, with the two companies now saying they plan to install 8 GW of renewable energy at the Gascoyne site.
The MoU will see the companies perform a feasibility study for the hydrogen project, with the pair aiming to execute definitive agreements within four months.
Each company will bear its own costs during the MoU, and if they decide to move forward with the partnership, each will have a 50% stake in the project. In which case, the development of the integrated hybrid renewable energy capacity would be led by Total Eren, and will take place in two stages.
The involvement of Total Eren will also likely de-risk the project, which is Province Resources first foray into the world of utility-scale green energy.
Province Resources
Fabienne Demol, Executive Vice-President and Global Head of Business Development of Total Eren, said the company is pleased to partner with Province on its “ambitious” project, highlighting its potential significance.
“This new step demonstrates our strong commitment to the Australian market towards the decarbonisation of the country and is also a concrete opportunity to kick-off our Hydrogen strategy worldwide.
“After solar, wind, and storage, we believe Hydrogen is the next step of growth of renewable energies.
“We are determined to leverage our development and technical skills to make our first of several Hydrogen Projects in Australia a success.”
Earlier this month, Province announced it had applied for additional 864 square kilometres of tenure for the HyEnergy project, in addition to the 2,272 square kilometres it is securing in Gascoyne. The region of Gascoyne was selected in part because of its infrastructure, which includes the Dampier Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline and the North West Coastal Highway.
It also has considerable wind speeds and solar exposure. Province has appointed Sydney-based technology company Fulcrum3D to collect preliminary wind and solar data every 10 minutes within the project area to further assess the natural resource potential. In March, Province also appointed multinational ERM to de-risk the project for the raft of necessary approvals.
The cracking pace of the project, which has seen Province’s share price increase by over 400% since Februar, is seeking to capitalise on Australia’s wave of hydrogen enthusiasm. As the company has noted, Western Australia’s Hydrogen Strategy has devoted $10 million worth of funding to green hydrogen, while the the Australian Renewable Energy Agency has earmarked $70 million and the Australian Government’s Advancing Hydrogen Fund has set aside $300 million.
“Given the recent drive by state and federal governments to quickly develop and advance the green hydrogen industry in Australia, I am confident this project will be of strategic national importance,” Province Resource’s Managing Director, David Frances, said.
“Management is excited to have a global renewable energy leader such as Total Eren as a partner with the technical and financial capability to help Province deliver this project as part of the backbone of the nation’s hydrogen strategy.”

A group of scientists from the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore has examined the challenges of bringing green hydrogen to a distant location and whether it is better to transport renewable electricity there via a long-distance electric cable to produce the clean fuel on-site or to first produce it and transport it to the distant location via a gas pipeline.
In the paper “Long-distance renewable hydrogen transmission via cables and pipelines,” recently published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, the researchers assessed the economical feasibility of both options. “The cost only considered the ‘transmission’ portion but the upper stream cost is also added as a ‘lump sum,’” research co-author Miao Bin told pv magazine. “So the cost is doorstep hydrogen from a renewable source to energy importer’s terminal.”
The academics started from the assumption that large-scale batteries are still unviable in storing grid electricity and that the capacity factor of renewable energy sources is still incapable of sustaining a stable grid operation.
Analysing the electric line option, they stressed that the high voltage alternating current (HVAC) cables and the high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission lines that are usually built for the transport of electricity to distant locations suffer from losses that reach 6.7% and 3.5% per 1000 km, respectively. “The AC cable possesses higher dissipative losses and higher material cost over high voltage and long-distance energy transmission due to the skin effect of the alternating current,” they explained. “The longest power transmission projects are HVDC overhead transmission cables and are mainly located in the continent countries.” In the cost assessment for an HVDC line, they considered the renewable sources, AC transmission lines, an AC to DC converter station, HVDC transmission lines, a DC to AC converter station, and AC transmission and distribution lines.
As for the second option, the research group considered the cost for setting up the power-to-gas facilities, gas buffer storage tanks, compressors, the gas pipeline itself, and receiving infrastructures. “The hydrogen pipeline cost was assumed to be similar to that of natural gas pipelines with an additional 10% increase,” it specified.
The electricity cost is assumed to be $78.67/MWh, which the scientists described as the simple average from solar PV, onshore and offshore wind costs, while the averaged capacity factor is assumed at 32.7%. Power transmission losses for the cable line are estimated at 3.5% per 1000 km and the fugitive emission from the high-pressure gas pipeline is assumed to be between 0.02% and 0.05% per 1000 km per year. One gigawatt of renewable power was assumed to be transmitted in the cable or pipeline.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/20/first-solar-claims-lowest-module-degradation-rate-in-the-industry/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 20, 2021",First Solar claims lowest module degradation rate in the industry,"From pv magazine Global
US cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar module manufacturer First Solar has announced that its most powerful products — the Series 6 CuRe panels — have achieved what it claims to be the lowest degradation rate in the PV industry.
The company said the panel degradation rate was 0.2% per year and its temperature coefficient -0.28% per degree Celsius. “This unprecedented degradation rate is up to 60% lower than conventional crystalline silicon (c-Si) products, and ensures that the module will retain at least 92% of its original performance at the end of its 30-year warranty,” it explained, without disclosing whether the results were confirmed by an independent entity.
The panel maker specified the module’s increased stability was achieved thanks to its Copper Replacement (CuRe) program, through which it replaced copper with elements from the fifth column of the periodic table (Group V). This group includes elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth.
Copper was removed as it may easily change energy states and diffuse spatially, thus creating a risk of instabilities. The novel doping technology was developed in 2019 in partnership with the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and presented in a study published in nature. The NREL said at the time that elements from the fifth column of the periodic table (Group V), such as antimony or arsenic, were placed onto tellurium crystal sites.
“Series 6 CuRe represents innovation in its truest form,” said First Solar CEO Mark Widmar. “From engineering the atoms in the semiconductor to its ability to withstand extreme weather events such as hailstorms, and from the social license that comes built-in to being able to recycle over 90% of each module, this responsibly-produced technology is packed with innovation designed to address many of our customers’ biggest challenges.”
According to the product sheet, the module is available in six wattages from 450 to 480 W and has a power conversion efficiency ranging from 19.3% to 19.0%. It has a size of 2,024×1,245 mm and a weight of up to 39.4 kg. The open-circuit voltage is between 221.7 and 226.0 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 2.66 to 2.67 A. The maximum system voltage for the module is 1,500 V.
The panels can be used with operating temperatures of between -40°C and 85°C. They come with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 12-year product guarantee.
