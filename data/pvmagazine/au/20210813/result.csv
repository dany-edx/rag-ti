The project will centre on the small Central Highlands community of Derwent Bridge which continues to struggle with power quality and reliability issues and is often forced to rely on mobile generation.
The project, which will also involve Brisbane-based clean energy company Redback Technologies and knowledge sharing institute API, will investigate and implement a feasible and resilient power supply option for Derwent Bridge and other remote communities, some of which still rely on diesel generators.
A key objective of the project will be to develop tools that can assess the technical and economic viability of a microgrid at a site, in addition to an analysis of the impact on the local economy.
Project leader Dr Jahangir Hossain, from the UTS’ Faculty of Engineering and IT, said the team will investigate whether establishing a microgrid, or upgrading existing off-grid technologies, would better meet the energy needs of regional and remote communities.
The federal government has awarded UTS and its three industry partners a $1.6 million grant from its Regional and Remote Communities Reliability Fund to launch the project.
Hossain said the project will provide measurable economic, social, environmental and technical benefits.
“The main outcome is to provide a cost-effective and resilient power supply solution for the local businesses and communities while the associated negative effects from technical and economic perspective are either eliminated or minimised,” he said.
“The advanced mathematical optimisation models developed in this project will be capable of handling forecasting, operations and planning of microgrids in an integrated, novel and improved manner.”
The planning tools will also provide a solution for reliable energy supply for remote communities in the event of natural disasters, during peak demand and localised blackouts.

Hossain said one of the big challenges the feasibility study will seek to address is the low availability of solar resource at Derwent Bridge.
Tasmania is a shining light for renewable electricity, reaching its 100% renewable energy target last year. In November, Tasmania became fully powered by renewable electricity, thanks primarily to the island state’s wind and hydro-electricity projects.
But while the state’s high rainfall and mountainous topography mean it is well suited to hydro-electric and wind energy projects, it is lagging far behind all other states and territories in the solar stakes.
Figures provided by the government reveal that about 31,000 customers in the state have connected solar PV systems and solar contributes an estimated 200 GWh per year, or about 2% of consumption.
There are no operational utility-scale solar farms. The state’s largest solar project – the 12.5 MW Wesley Solar Farm – was given the green light in 2018 but has not been heard of since. The project was proposed by renewables developer Epuron, which previously secured approval for another utility scale project – the 5 MW George Town Solar Farm, which has not been commissioned to date.
Despite the slow uptake of solar PV, there have been success stories, including the recent unveiling of a 280kWh Redflow battery-based microgrid at a property in the state’s northwest.

Simon Hackett, a systems integration architect with Australian energy storage company Redflow, has installed of 100 kWp solar array and energy storage system at his sheep farm in northwest Tasmania.
Tasmanian Minister for Energy Guy Barnett said the Derwent Bridge study would evaluate whether a microgrid would provide an alternative energy solution to the town’s existing power reliability issues.
“Microgrids reduce reliance on diesel generation, cut emissions, and provide a secure source of electricity for households and businesses,” he said.
The project is one of 20 remote and regional microgrid projects to receive federal government financing as part of a funding boost designed to increase the use of renewable energy in regional Australia.
A total of $25.6 million in funding was last month issued under the second round of the Regional and Remote Communities Reliability Fund. A total of 20 projects will share in funding – spread across every Australian state – to test and demonstrate new innovations in microgrid projects.
Federal energy minister Angus Taylor said regional and remote communities face unique energy challenges and the federal government is committed to ensuring they are not disadvantaged by unreliable and expensive energy.
“The Regional and Remote Communities Reliability Fund is all about shoring up the supply of secure, reliable and affordable energy for regional Australians and empowering communities to make the choices to best suit their energy needs,” he said.
“Every Australian, no matter where they live, should be confident that they will have the power they need, when they need it and at an affordable price.”
The first round of the Regional and Remote Communities Reliability Fund, announced in June 2020, focused on transitioning power supplies in remote communities to renewable options and the use of renewables in agricultural operations.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/13/energy-giants-2-06-billion-loss-labelled-a-titanic-failure/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 13, 2021",Energy giant’s $2.06 billion loss labelled a ‘Titanic’ failure,"Australian energy utility AGL acknowledged the rise of renewable energy assets and the impact of uncertain energy policy and increased pressure on margins had contributed to its financial pain after reporting a 34% decline in its underlying profit for the 2021-22 financial year to $537 million.
“There has been continued uncertainty regarding energy policy and an acceleration of the market forces that determine our strategy,” AGL chair Peter Botten said.
“Our financial results for FY21 reflect these ongoing challenging market and operating conditions facing the energy industry, as well as the impact of the decline in wholesale electricity prices that has occurred over the past two years.”
The financial pain looks set to continue with AGL, the country’s biggest operator of coal-fired power plants, warning on Thursday it expects its profit to drop to between $220 million and $340 million for the year to June 2022 as lower wholesale power prices continue to weigh on its financial performance.
“The short-term outlook remains challenging,” Botten said.

Greenpeace Australia Pacific senior campaigner Glenn Walker said the performance was a “Titanic failure” on the part of the company to navigate the changing energy market.
“Watching AGL fail is like watching the Titanic hit the iceberg, only this time the iceberg’s made of coal,” he said.
“AGL and other big energy companies, like Origin and Energy Australia, have written down billions over the last year. That trend is only going to accelerate as even more renewables come onto the grid and the growing gap between cheaper clean energy and coal and gas prices becomes a chasm.”
AGL hopes to stop the bleeding by splitting into two businesses as it looks to navigate the transition to renewables, with a shareholder vote expected by June 2022.
Accel Energy will retain the company’s coal-fired power plants and wind farm contracts, and would spin off AGL Australia, the country’s biggest retailer of electricity and gas, into a separately listed company.
AGL Australia will own and operate Australia’s largest private hydro fleet, fast start gas-fired power stations, a growing battery development portfolio and a 20% investment in renewables firm PowAR, which includes the Broken Hill Solar Farm in its portfolio of renewable assets.
“Financial year 2021 was one of the toughest energy markets we have seen, wholesale electricity prices were at levels not seen since 2012, while demand was impacted by lockdowns, mild weather and increasing penetration from rooftop solar,” AGL Energy chief executive Graeme Hunt told analysts at an investor briefing.
“As we see the pace of change continue to accelerate, we are further assured and committed to our proposed demerger strategy. Subject to approval, the proposed demerger will create two new entities with clarity of purpose and strong foundations, which will position them well to lead the energy transition, while protecting and delivering value to shareholders.”

Hunt said despite the tough market conditions, AGL had made good progress in its transition towards renewables.
AGL has announced plans to establish 850 MW of grid-scale battery projects at its thermal generation sites across Australia by 2024. The 250 MW/250 MWh at the site of its Torrens Island power station in South Australia is scheduled to be the first to commence construction.
The energy retailer has also acquired commercial and industrial solar businesses Epho and Solgen Energy Group. The acquisitions will see AGL deliver more than 70 MW of C&I solar each year, making it the largest commercial solar provider in Australia.
“I am excited for the opportunities ahead as we continue to execute on our strategy and undertake the demerger,” Hunt said.
The results posted by AGL on Thursday do not reflect this week’s announcement from Tomago Aluminium Smelter, AGL’s biggest customer, that it plans to replace its contract with AGL’s Bayswater plant in New South Wales with renewable energy when it that contract expires in 2028.
Dan Gocher, the director of climate and environment at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said the announcement should signal the end for the coal-fired power station, which is scheduled to close in 2035.
“Tomago’s announcement is the final nail in the coffin for the Bayswater coal-fired power station,” Gocher said. “Without its largest customer, AGL is unlikely to make a profit from Bayswater beyond 2029.”

Darlington Point, jointly owned by Edify and Octopus, is the largest solar farm connected to the National Electricity Market (NEM), with an estimated 1,000,000 solar modules spread over 1,000 hectares and an output equivalent to powering about 115,000 Australian homes.
Octopus has confirmed U.S.-based technology provider Fluence’s AI-powered Trading Platform will be deployed to ensure the project maximises generation during favourable market conditions and responds to market price signals to avoid generation at times of over-supply and negative prices.
“We are always striving to find innovative solutions that will improve asset performance for our investors,” Octopus Australia managing director Sam Reynolds said.
“Solutions like this will help maximise revenue and investor returns by reducing price volatility, minimising costs and mitigating constraints.”
Darlington Point has a signed power purchase agreement (PPA) with Delta Electricity, the owner of the Vales Point coal-fired power station, for 150 MW or approximately 55% of its output.
A 100 MW/ 200 MWh lithium-ion battery project is also set to be constructed alongside the solar farm after the statre government earlier this year announced a $3.2 billion 10-year contract with Edify and Shell Energy.

The Riverina Energy Storage System, to be built by early 2023 and operated by Edify, will provide critical dispatchable electricity prior to the closure of the Liddell Power Station.
Australia’s energy market is among the most complex in the world, with energy and ancillary services requiring assets to trade at five-minute intervals while integrating increasing amounts of variable renewable energy.
Renewable energy generation and battery asset operators in the NEM are having to deal with exposure to negative prices, physical grid constraints, frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) costs, and managing trading strategies.
Fluence chief digital officer Seyed Madaeni said automated bidding solutions are becoming a critical tool for asset owners in the NEM, where renewable energy assets need extremely accurate price forecasting capabilities to navigate “an increasingly volatile market”.
“The deployment of our AI-based trading platform at the largest solar farm in the NEM confirms that automated bidding tools are now firmly established as critical tools for operating renewable assets in the NEM,” he said.
“We’re excited to be supporting Octopus Investments and look forward to helping them navigate price volatility and constraints in an increasingly complex market.”

Fluence, the result of a joint venture between U.S. utility AES and global power giant Siemens, said its trading platform analyses thousands of variables to provide leading price forecasting and optimisation using proprietary machine learning algorithms.
The company claims it can increase revenue for standalone renewable energy assets by more than 10% and can increase revenue and operational efficiency for battery-based energy storage by 40-50%.
Fluence said the software-based trading platform is currently used to optimise about 1.5 GW of wind and solar energy assets bidding into the NEM.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has detailed that 30% of grid-scale solar and wind assets in the NEM had started using automated bidding solutions in the past two years.
Edify is among those developers who have embraced the technology, deploying an AI-backed trading platform at all of its projects to help navigate the increasing price volatility and maximize returns in the NEM.
The list of operational solar farms that the Australian developer manages and partly owns includes Daydream (180 MW), Hayman (60 MW), Whitsunday (69 MW), Hamilton (69 MW) and Gannawarra (60 MW).

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/13/lithium-sulfur-battery-with-shorter-charging-time-longer-lifespan/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,JAPAN,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 13, 2021","Lithium-sulfur battery with shorter charging time, longer lifespan","From pv magazine Global
One of the main issues with lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is that they cannot be recharged enough times to make them commercially viable. This is due to the formation of lithium polysulfides during the fabrication process and is the reason for the rapid deterioration of their capacity.
Scientists from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) in Japan claim to have overcome this issue by using two new materials – titanium oxide (TiO2) and titanium nitride (TiN).
During the fabrication of a lithium-sulfur battery, the lithium always reacts with sulfur, they said, noting that initially this combination produces lithium polysulfide, which can easily dissolve into polysulfides and negatively affect device performance. To improve the batteries, the lithium polysulfide should immediately begin to transform the final product into either lithium sulfide (Li2S) or lithium persulfide (Li2S2).
In the new battery configuration, the use of TiO2 is designed to absorb undesired polysulfides, while the TiN accelerates the absorption process. The scientists developed the best-performing battery by coating a carbon nanotube framework (CNT) with 10 nm of TiN and 5 nm of TiO2 and adopting an annealing post-treatment, which resulted in a uniform TiN-TiO2 heterostructure with high catalytic ability.
“The corresponding lithium-sulfur battery shows enhanced electrochemical performance with high specific capacity of 1289 mAh g−1 at 1 C and capacity retention of 85% after 500 cycles at 2 C,” the Japanese scientists stated.
This performance translates into shorter charging times, longer life between charges, and greater overall lifespans, they claimed. They described their battery and the related manufacturing process in “Long-life lithium-sulfur batteries with high areal capacity based on coaxial CNTs@TiN-TiO2 sponge,” which was recently published in Nature Communications.
The University of Maryland and the Argonne National Laboratory have also recently conducted research on the polysulfide issue for sulfur-lithium batteries.

Ambri Inc., an MIT-spinoff long-duration battery energy storage system developer, secured US$144 million (AU$195 million) in funding to advance calcium-antimony liquid metal battery chemistry.
The investment round was led by Reliance New Energy Solar Ltd, a unit of Reliance Industries Limited; Paulson & Co. Inc., a group that includes Ambri’s largest shareholder, Bill Gates; and new investors, including Fortistar, Goehring & Rozencwajg Associates, Japan Energy Fund, and others.
The company plans to use proceeds to commercialise and grow its long-duration system technology and to build manufacturing facilities, both in the U.S. and internationally.
Ambri also entered into a long-term antimony supply agreement with Perpetua Resources.  The agreement helps secure a domestic source of antimony for its supply chain.
The liquid metal battery is comprised of a liquid calcium alloy anode, a molten salt electrolyte, and a cathode comprised of solid particles of antimony, enabling the use of low-cost materials and a low number of steps in the cell assembly process.
The company said that the active materials in its cells reversibly alloy and de-alloy while charging and discharging. The electrolyte is thermodynamically stable with the electrodes, avoiding side reactions such as film-formation that can lead to performance degradation. The negative electrode is fully consumed when discharged, and reformed on every cycle, resulting in what the company said is a “highly repeatable process with no memory effect.”
Ambri’s chemistry is being developed to meet the demands of large industrial energy customers, such as data centres. Late last year, Ambri agreed with TerraScale, a clean infrastructure design and development firm, to deliver  250 MWh of Ambri systems to TerraScale’s Energos Reno data center project. The site’s battery will be bolstered by a reported 500 MW of on-site renewable generation.
Ambri said that following the funding round it now is able to scale for projects from 10 MWh to over 2 GWh around the globe, with durations ranging from 4 to 24 hours.
