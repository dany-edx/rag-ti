https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/04/queensland-company-promises-to-turn-noxious-weeds-into-green-coal/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 4, 2022",Queensland company promises to turn noxious weeds into ‘green coal’,"Green Day Energy is proposing to construct a biomass plant in the central Queensland town of Richmond using a weed, prickly acacia, as its input material. The company says it has developed a torrefaction process which will turn the invasive species into woodchip pellets suitable for use in power plants. It has also signalled it could produce agricultural product biochar from the weed, and potentially even hydrogen.
The $30 million plant would be capable of producing 100,000 tonnes of biomass per annum, requiring 300,000 tonnes of raw material, which in this case appears to be exclusively prickly acacia plants. This could represent a removal of around one million weed plants per year.
Originating in Africa, the prickly acacia is a problem across Queensland and the Northern Territory, taking over grasslands and depleting soil.
Last week, Green Day Energy signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Richmond Shire Council giving it access to 10,000 hectares (100 square kilometres) of prickly acacia-infested land. 
Putting aside the project’s promise of turning a noxious weed into a valuable product, and consequently ridding northern Australia of it, it’s worth noting each of the output options would substantially shift the project’s green credibility. 
Biomass is not a zero emissions energy source. It emits carbon and other pollutants – arguably as much or more than coal itself – but it is classed as “carbon neutral” because, theoretically, the carbon emitted from wood when burned can be sucked back into trees as they grow.
The biomass industry has many critics, with some – including Australian Conservation Fund’s Suzanne Harter –  skeptical about establishing a biomass or wood pellet industry in Australia, after the methods have come into widespread disrepute in North America and Europe.
On the other hand, biochar – which is not burned but rather buried in the ground to promote healthy soil in the agriculture industry – easily classifies as ‘green.’ Biochar in an increasingly in demand product, though perhaps not enough in itself to build a business case on. 
Green Day Energy founder Brad Carswell has also gestured at the potential for the project to produce hydrogen through a patented process of “pressure swing adsorption,” according to regional newspaper the North Queensland Register.
Carswell estimates the method can produce 200 kilograms of hydrogen from every tonne of biochar.
Realising this would require the company to extend its plant proposal, for which it has now began capital raising. It is hoping to begin work on the plant by mid-year.
Central Queensland University (CQUniversity) is also partnering on the project, assisting the company with research and development.
Biomass to hydrogen projects have become increasingly popular in Australia over the last year. In September, Sweetman Renewables, born of the century-old Sweetman’s Timber sawmill, announced its plan to produce hydrogen by gasifying woodchips using partner CAC-H2’s technology.
Since then, CAC-H₂ announced project partnerships with Patriot Hydrogen and Clean Holdings. Verdant Earth Technologies and Port Anthony Renewables Limited are also developing biomass to hydrogen plans, with energy investor Liberty Energy Capital supporting both companies as well as Sweetmans.

As of March 25, a Tesla Powerwall will now set Australian customers back an extra $950, with prices rising from $12,750 to $13,700.
The Powerwall system today is significantly more expensive than it was when it launched in 2017 costing just $9,600. 
This isn’t the first time Tesla has changed its Powerwall system prices, having bounced between the $12,000 to $13,300 mark since 2018, though it’s worth noting the recent price hike takes it to its most expensive price point yet.
Nevertheless, Tesla remains Australia’s most popular battery brand. 
Maintaining its penchant for dashing all hopes and forecasts, Australia’s storage market – and indeed the world’s – looks like it will only continue to increase in terms of pricing. 
In March, business data company IHS Markit has predicted lithium-ion battery prices will not fall until 2024, thanks to rising metal prices, soaring demand for electric vehicles (EVs), and China’s near monopoly on the industry.
Analyst Wood Mackenzie is slightly more optimistic, predicting the heaving demand for batteries and wanting supply of materials will begin to ease by next year.

On Saturday, the company announced its partnership with Victoria-based Climate Capital, saying it plans to source the electricity for its plant from Climate Capital’s planned 5MW ground-mounted solar farm in George Town, which neighbours Bell Bay, just north of Launceston. 
While both the solar farm and the hydrogen plant are still in the planning stages, Line Hydrogen says it expects to break ground on the project by mid-year and is targeting first production on January 31, 2023.
The $100 million project is seeking to produce 1,500 kilograms of green hydrogen daily and is targeting heavy haulage and mining industries for offtake.
Our goal is to provide locally produced, commercial scale green hydrogen fuel, along with the technology and equipment to produce the fuel and the engines to run on them #LINEhydrogen #GreenHydrogen #NetZero pic.twitter.com/6OpvRmPVcs

Line Hydrogen founder and chairman Brendan James estimates Australians consume around 84 million litres of diesel daily, with the company noting that transitioning diesel-reliant industries will be its primary market focus. James is a metallurgical engineer and co-founded the company with what is presumably his wife, Nicole James (though their relationship is unconfirmed).
The company plans to list on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) this year, and is also planning a project double the size of the Bell Bay plant for southern Queensland’s Toowoomba, Line Hydrogen told The Australian over the weekend.
It wants the $200 million Toowoomba plant to be ready by March 2024 with the company targeting production of 3,000kg of green hydrogen daily. It said it has been working on this project for the last two years, since the company’s founding. 
In addition to the terms sheet agreement for the Bell Bay solar power offtake, the pair have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to “identify, develop and deliver co-located green hydrogen production plants across the country.” No further details about what this entails, nor whether Climate Capital will be a partner on the Toowoomba plant are known.
Victoria’s Climate Capital holds two solar farms in Australia in addition to Bell Bay, including the Boonanaring Solar Farm in Western Australia which is already operating and the Tregalana Solar Farm in South Australia, from which stage one is currently under construction.
The $8 million Bell Bay solar farm has secured development approval for its site and is expected to be completed within the year, shortly before the hydrogen plant.
As Tasmania’s primary port, Bell Bay has been proposed for a number of hydrogen projects in the last year by some of Australia’s biggest players. Fortescue Future Industries, Woodside and Origin have signalled they will be exploring the potential of developing green hydrogen projects in the area.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/04/australia-plans-to-be-a-big-green-hydrogen-exporter-to-asian-markets-but-they-dont-need-it/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,ASIA,AUSTRALIA",,"APRIL 4, 2022",Australia plans to be a big green hydrogen exporter to Asian markets – but they don’t need it,"From the Conversation
In its latest budget, the federal government has promised hundreds of millions of dollars to expand Australia’s green hydrogen capabilities.
Green hydrogen is made by electrolysis of water, powered by solar and wind electricity, and it’s key to the government’s “technology not taxes” approach to meeting its climate target of net-zero emissions by 2050.
The government aims to create a major green hydrogen export industry, particularly to Japan, for which Australia signed an export deal in January. But as our latest research suggests, the likely scale may well be overstated.
We show Japan has more than enough solar and wind energy to be self-sufficient in energy, and does not need to import either fossil fuels or Australian green hydrogen. Indeed, Australia as a “renewable energy superpower” is far from a sure thing.
“Green” hydrogen could be used to generate electricity and also to form chemicals such as ammonia and synthetic jet fuel.
In the federal budget, hydrogen fuel is among the low-emissions technologies that will share over A$1 billion. This includes $300 million for producing clean hydrogen, along with liquefied natural gas, in Darwin.
Australia plans to be a top-three exporter of hydrogen to Asian markets by 2030. The idea is that green hydrogen will help replace Australia’s declining coal and gas exports as countries make good on their promises to bring national greenhouse gas emissions down to zero.
Underlying much of this discussion is the notion that crowded jurisdictions such as Japan and Europe have insufficient solar and wind resources of their own, which is wrong.
Our recent study investigated the future role of renewable energy in Japan, and we modelled a hypothetical scenario where Japan had a 100% renewable electricity system.
We found Japan has 14 times more solar and offshore wind energy potential than needed to supply all its current electricity demand.
Electrifying nearly everything – transport, heating, industry and aviation – doubles or triples demand for electricity, but this still leaves Japan with five to seven times more solar and offshore wind energy potential than it needs.
After building enough solar and wind farms, Japan can get rid of fossil fuel imports without increasing energy costs. This removes three quarters of its greenhouse gas emissions and eliminates the security risks of depending on foreign energy suppliers.
Our study comprised an hourly energy balance model, using representative demand data and 40 years of historical hourly solar and wind meteorological data.
We found that the levelised cost of electricity from an energy system in Japan dominated by solar and wind is US$86-110 (A$115-147) per megawatt hour. Levelised cost is the standard method of costing electricity generation over a generator’s lifetime.
This is similar to Japan’s 2020 average spot market prices (US$102 per megawatt hour) – and it’s about half the cost of electricity generated in Japan using imported green hydrogen from Australia.
So why is it much more expensive to produce electricity from imported Australian hydrogen, compared to local solar and wind?
Essentially, it’s because 70% of the energy is lost by converting Australian solar and wind energy into hydrogen compounds, shipping it to Japan, and converting the hydrogen back into electricity or into motive power in cars.
Thus, hydrogen as an energy source is unlikely to develop into a major export industry.
What about exporting sustainable chemicals? Hydrogen atoms are required to produce synthetic aviation fuel, ammonia, plastics and other chemicals.
The main elements needed for such products are hydrogen, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, all of which are available everywhere in unlimited quantities from water and air. Japan can readily make its own sustainable chemicals rather than importing hydrogen or finished chemicals.
However, the Japanese cost advantage is smaller for sustainable chemicals than energy, and so there may be export opportunities here.
While large-scale fossil fuel deposits are found in only a few countries, most countries have plenty of solar and/or wind. The future decarbonised world will have far less trade in energy, because most countries can harvest it from their own resources.
Solar and wind comprise three quarters of the new power stations installed around the world each year because they produce cheaper energy than fossil fuels. About 250 gigawatts per annum of solar and wind is being installed globally, doubling every three to four years
Densely populated coastal areas – including Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam and northern Europe – have vast offshore wind resources to complement onshore solar and wind.
What’s more, densely populated Indonesia has sufficient calm tropical seas to power the entire world using floating solar panels.
Will international markets need Australian energy for when the sun isn’t shining, nor the wind blowing? Probably not. Most countries have the resources to reliably and continuously meet energy demand without importing Australian products.
This is because most countries, including Japan (and, for that matter, Australia) have vast capacity for off-river pumped hydro, which can store energy to balance out solar and wind at times when they’re not available. Batteries and stronger internal transmission networks also help.
Getting rid of fossil fuels and electrifying nearly everything with renewables reduces greenhouse emissions by three quarters, and lowers the threat of extreme climate change. It eliminates security risks from relying on other countries for energy, as illustrated by Europe’s dependence on Russian gas.
It will also bring down energy costs, and eliminates oil-related warfare, oil spills, cooling water use, open cut coal mines, ash dumps, coal mine fires, gas fracking and urban air pollution.
Australia’s coal and gas exports must decline to zero before mid-century to meet the global climate target, and solar and wind are doing most of the heavy lifting through renewable electrification of nearly everything.
But as our research makes clear, while Australian solar and wind is better than most, it may not be enough to overcome the extra costs and losses from exporting hydrogen for energy supply or chemical production.
One really large prospect for export of Australian renewable energy is export of iron, in which hydrogen produced from solar and wind might replace coking coal.
This allows Australia to export iron rather than iron ore. In this case the raw material (iron ore), solar and wind are all found in the same place: in the Pilbara.
While hydrogen will certainly be important in the future global clean economy, it will primarily be for chemicals rather than energy production. It’s important to keep perspective: electricity from solar and wind will continue to be far more important.

The Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue 2022, which was held on Mar. 29 and 30 in the German capital, has inevitably seen the war in Ukraine dominate discussions and has also clearly shown that politicians, stakeholders, and analysts all agree that there is no way back to old mindsets and conventional approaches to energy supply.
“We are not on track to stop climate change and we have to be very aggressive at this stage,” said Francesco La Camera, the Director-General of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) during the opening session of the event.
“Germany wants to become fully energy independent from Russia,” said the German Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs, Annalena Baerbock during the same session. “Going alone, nationally, won’t work. We need a common European approach, which means Europe may become the world’s first continent in becoming climate-neutral.”
The German Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, Robert Habeck, said there is a need for a common European effort to reduce energy dependence on Russia, although he admitted this will not be easy to achieve, noting the high costs German households and businesses may be forced to face in the near future. “We need to upscale renewables and bring back renewable energy manufacturing to Europe, even if it will be costlier,” he said. “We have to ensure prosperity while protecting the peace.”
In a short conversation with pv magazine after the opening session, La Camera stressed the centrality of green hydrogen in the long transition phase that we are likely to experience in the years to come. “Green energy capacity and demand should grow together, but when we speak for hydrogen producers they all say they are ready, but demand is still too low,” he said. “The problem is that big energy consumers that want to transition from one fuel to another have to adapt their infrastructure and this is probably not the right moment to add these costs. If we want to accelerate this process, policymakers will have to take the right steps.”
According to La Camera, the world will increasingly rely on green hydrogen, although at the current pace it may not be enough to help reduce carbon emissions and comply with Paris climate targets. “We need incentives of any kind, from tax credits to investment support,” he said. “There are many tools available and reducing tax burdens on new investments by businesses that want to rely on clean and climate-neutral fuels is a key move in this turbulent transition phase.”
La Camera suggested a granular approach should be considered for implementing these policies, depending on the particular regional characteristics of each market. “And this is not only about hydrogen,” La Camera said, “because its development goes hand in hand with that of renewables. We need electricity grids that can absorb the huge potential we have. For example, in North Europe, we could add immediately enormous amounts of wind power, but we don’t have enough network capacity. Improving and building infrastructures is one of our biggest task.”
According to IRENA Director-General, the market may help solve most of the issues that politics will not address. “Inevitable, the market will select the less expensive energy generation sources,” he said. “The problem is how quickly this scenario may materialise. Once we will have filled the gap between several sectors and the cheapest options, we will see an unprecedented deployment of renewable and green hydrogen. For this, creating a hydrogen demand is crucial and incentives for helping enterprises reconvert their energy supply to the clean fuel.”

French chemical company Axcentive and solar module manufacturer Photowatt, a unit of France-based energy giant EDF, are jointly developing a self-cleaning coating for solar panels under the umbrella of the European project PV Impact, which is being coordinated by the Association of European Renewable Energy Research Centres and is aimed at stimulating the private sector to spend more on PV research, development and innovation in Europe.
The coating will be based on photoactive nanotechnology and commercialised under the brand name Exocoat. It is described by the two companies as a self-cleaning coating for glass substrates, activated by light. “Under light radiation, the coating creates radicals which breakdown any organic soil or contamination,” they said in a joint statement. “Airborne particles such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitric oxide (NOx) are also eradicated.”
The coating relies on a super-hydrophilic surface that makes the water spread out on the module surface immediately, thus avoiding light scattering effects upon rain. Furthermore, this surface is said to increase the self–cleaning effect by letting water flow under the dirt and remove it by gravitational forces. “A more practical method to follow the effects on the surface is its response to a powdered substance that would cause fouling, and the effect to water spray. The hydrophilic surface of the coating will be less statically charged and, as a result, will attract less dirt,” the statement reads.
Scientists from the two companies tested the coating on a carbon powder against a plate that was half coated with Exocoat itself. They sprayed water on the plate and found that the coated side showed full wetting and self–cleaning due to the water sheeting effect. “A vital point for the performance of Exocoat as self-cleaning coating is its correct application on the glass/solar panel surface,” said Arno Schut, innovation manager at Axcentive. “Incorrect application can lead to inferior technical performance. Axcentive has written application protocols based for hand and automatic spray application that were developed in the lab and need to be tested on site.”
The two companies are currently seeking to improve their technology by seeking spray equipment manufacturers.
