The situation has led Australia’s only manufacturer of solar modules, Tindo Solar, to release a stockpile of 1000 panels to the wholesale market. The Adelaide-based company says it opted to release the stocks “to help installation companies who are facing the prospect of cancelling their pre-Christmas installs because they can’t access China-sourced panels.”
“We’ve been fielding calls for more than a month, with solar installation companies desperate for panels,” Tindo Solar’s Chief Executive Officer, Shayne Jaenisch, said. “Not only are they faced with not enough panels to fulfil their installations, but the panels they can buy are 30 to 50% more expensive than they were mid-year.”

Jaenisch said installers are being warned by wholesale panel suppliers that the current conditions will get worse, a sentiment mirrored by One Stop Warehouse’s Head of Product Procurement and Marketing, Andy Cheng, who told pv magazine Australia last month that prices would continue to rise into 2022. 
China is the world’s largest solar supplier, dominating not only panel manufacturing but the entire upstream supply chain. Which means the ramifications of the country’s energy crisis combined with shortages of polysilicon and price hikes for solar glass, aluminium and other materials (which have risen between  9% to 35% since the first quarter of the year) have been felt globally. 
Australia, as Cheng noted, is in a particularly delicate position though, competing for stock against Europe and the United States – both of which are far bigger markets and better able to absorb the pricing turbulence. Adding to that, Australia doesn’t have what one would call a diversified portfolio – sourcing around 80% of its solar panels from China, according to the Clean Energy Regulator.
One of China’s largest solar manufacturing companies, Longi, said it is working to secure supply to Australia. According to the Managing Director of the company’s Australian arm, Stephan Zhang, Longi’s vertical integration has allowed it to weather the current storm better than smaller outfits.
Longi recently refocussed on its longterm partnership with One Stop Warehouse, Australia’s largest solar distributor, saying it had signed an agreement with it to guarantee a significant supply of solar modules to Australia in 2022.
Longi said it was able to do so because it creates all of the key components that go into its modules, rather than purchasing them from third party suppliers. As such, it said, Longi Solar Australia is able to make sure that they have enough stock for their Australian customers.
Coming back to Tindo Solar, Jaenisch said as Australia’s only manufacturer, the company has received an “overwhelming number of enquiries” as industry turns to it for stock. In response, Tindo is releasing 30 Pallets (33 panels per pallet) of its Karra330P modules. The wholesale-only release includes a 25-year product warranty at the standard pricing of $221.10 per panel ($0.67 per watt). Jaenisch said Tindo Solar is already looking at further release of 500 panels, given the demand.
Tindo Solar is currently in the process of commissioning its new factory in Adelaide which will have almost three-times the output of its old factory, if only it were ready now!

LAVO’s ‘green hydrogen batteries’ containerise metal hydride to store hydrogen’s energy. Coupled with rooftop solar, the systems can store 40 kWh of electricity, with LAVO describing its product as the first and only commercial-ready hydrogen energy storage system in the world designed for everyday use by residential homes and businesses.
LAVO will establish itself in Queensland with the help of the state government, which is supporting the manufacturing facility through its Invested in Queensland program, though it is unclear whether the state will front the full $15 million budget.

Construction of the new facility is set to begin in early 2022 with delivery as early as the end of that year. Manufacturing will begin there under a joint venture agreement LAVO has with Netherlands-based company Nedstack, which develops polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell technology.
While this facility will focus on producing fuel cells, LAVO is expected develop “more advanced manufacturing capabilities” in Queensland by 2024, including the assembly of additional hydrogen-based powered units and other hydrogen components such as electrolysers and hydride vessel production. The company chose to set up its manufacturing base in Springfield following two years of negotiating with Trade and Investment Queensland, which sought to attract the company to the state.
Queensland’s lobbying seems to be working rather well as the news of LAVO’s manufacturing plans come less than a week after Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) progressed its manufacturing ambitions in the state. FFI received its planning approval for its 2 GW electrolyser factory at Gladstone on Queensland’s southern coast just five weeks after it announced the plan, a wildly fast turnaround.
FFI, chaired by billionaire Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest, is also planning to build a 1 GW solar PV module manufacturing plant in Queensland, though the exact location is yet to be determined.

Back to LAVO, the company’s CEO and Executive Director, Alan Yu, said it will work to maximise the use of local suppliers in the manufacturing process and will be supplying both domestic and international markets across the residential, off-grid, telecommunications and commercial sectors.
Queensland’s Assistant Minister for Treasury, Charis Mullen, said LAVO’s decision was a vote of confidence in the region, which is aiming to become a hydrogen superpower. “This is an Australian-first and could be one of the largest hydrogen fuel cell facilities in the southern hemisphere, so it’s great news for workers and our community,” Mullen said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/24/queensland-to-build-common-user-vanadium-processing-plant/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 24, 2021",Queensland to build “common-user” vanadium processing plant,"The Queensland government plans to build and own a new vanadium processing plant in the northeastern coastal city of Townsville in a bid to start local production and get small operations off the ground. Vanadium is a key resource for the burgeoning flow battery market and is also drawing increased attention as a cathode material for lithium-ion batteries.
“Australia has the world’s third largest deposits of vanadium resources, but right now we don’t produce a single kilogram of processed vanadium,” Queensland’s Treasurer and Minister for Trade and Investment, Cameron Dick, said.
Queensland’s Minister for Resources and Member for Townsville, Scott Stewart, said his department would go to market in the new year for detailed engineering assessments and costings for the plant, for which the state government would front at least $10 million from its $520 million Invested in Queensland program. The final investment amount though will depend on the outcome of the construction tender.
The government said it is in the final stages of site selection within Townville, and expects construction to start in 2022, with the plant scheduled to begin operating in 2023. The facility is part of what the Palaszczuk government described as its push for the state to become a leading producer and exporter of “new-economy minerals” and “the home of new industries.”
In September, the state government announced it had given the go-ahead to its first vanadium mine, Multicom Resources’s $250 million Saint Elmo mine near Julia Creek, in the state’s north west. The Saint Elmo mine is forecast to initially produce up to 5,000 tonnes per annum of vanadium pentoxide, eventually scaling to 20,000 tonnes per annum. 

The mine is just the first planned for what the Queensland government calls the ‘North West Minerals Province’, an area of the state particularly rich in resources useful for the clean energy transition, include cobalt, nickel, rare earth elements, copper and, of course, vanadium.
Queensland’s north west has been earmarked as potential vanadium hub with other mine plans progressing alongside the Saint Elmo plan, like Critical Minerals Group’s Lindfield vanadium and High Purity Alumina (HPA) project, which covers 295km² in Julia Creek. The government also pointed to projects like the Townsville Energy Chemicals Hub at the Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct as part of its push into downstream and value added minerals industries.
Multicom Resources
“Vanadium is used for the construction of large-scale grid batteries that store their charge in tanks of liquid,” Queensland’s Treasurer Cameron Dick said. “Because they hold their charge in a liquid form, redox batteries can be built to a much larger scale, powering larger communities for longer,” he added. Redox flow batteries are, after a long time in the market, beginning to gain traction in the utility-scale storage stage. 
Treasurer Dick said a common-user facility like that to be built by the Queensland government can be used by multiple, smaller mining companies. “This is an important step in attracting further investor interest and future off-take agreements. 
“Once producers can see for themselves how processing occurs, they will have the confidence to invest in more manufacturing infrastructure and more jobs.”
The news was welcomed by Queensland community group Solar Citizens. “This is a smart investment by the Queensland government that is a step towards turning Townsville into a renewable industry hub,” Stephanie Gray, Energy Strategist at Solar Citizens, said.
“North Queensland’s mineral deposits and natural renewable resources mean Townsville is perfectly placed to process minerals for clean technology and produce renewable hydrogen for export. Investing in these opportunities will create good, future-proof jobs for the region.
“It’s a shame that the Morrison government is not taking this potential as seriously.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/24/uk-business-claims-to-have-worlds-most-sustainable-lithium-ion-battery/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM",MAX HALL,"NOVEMBER 24, 2021",UK business claims to have ‘world’s most sustainable lithium-ion battery’,"From pv magazine Global
An advanced-battery company based in the West Midlands of England claims to have developed “the most sustainable, low-waste lithium-ion battery in the world.”
Aceleron says its “compression technology method” has enabled it to produce products in which every component can be accessed for repair, replacement or upgrade. The company claims its ‘Essential’ product is fully recyclable, effectively giving the device an “infinite lifespan,” according to co-founder and chief technical officer Carlton Cummins.
Cummins said the Essential is the same size as a group-31 device – 330 by 173 by 240mm – and weighs around half as much as a traditional battery, with the company website listing a 15kg figure for the 12 V/100 Amp-hour (Ah); 24 V/50 Ah; and 48 V/25 Ah products listed on its website.
The developer states the Essential offers “up to” four times the cycle life and three times more continuous power than equivalent lead-acid devices.
The company says the modular design of the Essential means it can be used in series to power applications ranging from onboard motor home systems up to providing an uninterrupted power supply for data centres.
“As technology evolves, we have the ability to upgrade individual components without the need to discard the entire battery, staying true to our company ethos of promoting reuse and re-manufacture over waste, contributing to the increasingly crucial circular economy,” added Cummins.
That circular manufacturing approach has also been used in the Bromsgrove-based business’ new residential product, the Offgen, which Aceleron claims can offer storage capacity ranging from 4-11 kWh, thanks to its modular design.
The fact each battery pack in the residential system can be upgraded adds value to the investment, according to the developer, which said its home storage product can be installed in one electrical-grade cabinet which contains the device or devices, a hybrid inverter, a communications interface, and the switchgear.
The company founder with a flair for an eye-catching quote said of the residential system: “A house lasts for many decades and we believe your battery system should too.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/24/inexpensive-line-of-supply-no-longer-acceptable-federal-politicians-move-on-consequential-ban-for-solar-industries/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,EMPLOYMENT,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 24, 2021",‘Inexpensive line of supply no longer acceptable’: federal politicians move on consequential ban for solar industries,"On Monday, Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie introduced the ‘Customs Amendment (Banning Goods Produced by Forced Labour) Bill 2021’ into the federal House of Representatives, building on a bill of the same name initially proposed by independent Senator Rex Patrick.
While the current bill is not specific to one particular region, Senator Patrick’s earlier proposition centred on allegations of forced labour of China’s Uyghur population in the Xinjiang province, making it particularly consequential for the solar industry. Many Chinese polysilicon and metal silicon producers, key building blocks in crystalline silicon PV modules, operate production facilities in the Xinjiang region.
While China has strenuously denied the allegations of forced labour, the United States began detaining vast quantities of solar module imports from China in June of this year after legislating a ban on imports suspected of using forced labour.
Senator Patrick believes it’s time Australia’s solar industry took note. “The signals are already being sent to the industry that that inexpensive line of supply is no longer acceptable from a moral and ethical perspective,” Senator Patrick told pv magazine Australia.
“Businesses have to operate in a manner that is profitable, but also moral and ethical,” he said. “I’m not going to shy away from putting those moral and ethical obligations ahead of the bottom line of some people … They have to make changes, and I make no apology for that.”
Around 80% of solar panels installed in Australia are sourced from China, according to the Clean Energy Regulator.
The situation as it stands
MP Sharkie’s bill comes off the back of Senator Patrick’s bill of the same name which passed the Senate in August but languished in the Coalition-controlled House of Representatives without the Morrison government’s support. Senator Patrick was subsequently in discussions with MP Sharkie, who introduced a second iteration of the bill into the lower house this week.
“Australia cannot turn a blind eye to what is essentially profiteering from forced labour,” MP Sharkie told pv magazine Australia. “The United States has taken a stand on this issue. Australia needs to do the same.”
“Passing this legislation sends a clear message to the Chinese government,” Sharkie added.

What’s next
It’s possible the Sharkie bill, like Senator Patrick’s earlier attempt, will not pass the House of Representatives without Morrison government support. On Monday however, the Human Rights Law Centre, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Uyghur Tangritagh Womens’ Association, and Be Slavery Free called on the government to back the legislation.
The groups also asked the Coalition to implement all recommendations made by the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which earlier this year heard testimony of alleged mass internment and forced labour by Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims. Those recommendations include ensuring legislation can be robustly enforced, including additional investigative powers and resourcing for Australian Border Force and a rebuttable presumption that goods will be detained where evidence reasonably indicates the use of forced labour.
Whether or not MP Sharkie’s bill passes the lower house, Senator Patrick has vowed to keep pushing to ban imports suspected of using forced labour. “Governments are like big concrete balls rolling down a hill, you can stand in front of them and get squashed or you can push on the side for some period of time and it will change course. What I’m doing is pushing on the side of that concrete ball and looking to get a change in direction,” the senator said.
Solar industry blackout
In terms of what this could mean for Australia’s solar industries, Senator Patrick likened it to South Australia’s infamous state-wide blackout in 2016, which compelled the state to make investments which helped it become the global leader – but made for a bumpy transition. Likewise, he said if Australia’s solar industry fails to shift problematic supply chains, they too run the risk of having to be forced to gracelessly transition to more ethical practices. “We can bring along a bill that causes the solar panel blackout, but we’d be much better off doing it the right way around,” Patrick said.
The senator described himself as “proud” that his home state, South Australia, today leads Australia’s renewable energy transition, and believes a stronger stance on forced labour would actually bolster Australian solar businesses. Last week, the senator told Sky News: “solar panels are a good example of a product that could be made here in Australia but Australian businesses have no way of competing…”
Despite being largely credited as the birthplace of modern silicon solar cells, Australia currently has just one solar manufacturer, Tindo Solar in South Australia. While industry responses to allegations of forced labour have been strikingly muted here, the push to bring more renewable industries onshore enjoys widespread support. For Senator Patrick, a ban on suspected forced labour imports is crucial for making that happen.
Phased transition concession
While his initial bill did not recommend a phased introduction, Senator Patrick said he would be supportive of such an amendment to help with the logistics of transitioning supply chains. He also conceded additional intelligence capabilities would likely need to be established.
Speaking to the issue of verifying supply chains, however, Senator Patrick said: “I don’t think it is as big of a problem as what it’s made out to be and, indeed, I would suggested that we would cooperate very closely with the Department of Homeland Security in the United States and other likeminded customs organisations around the world and approach this in that multilateral manner.”
“I think there are ways to find solutions, but you have to have a will,” he added.
The senator also noted technological advancements are making it easier to track the origins of raw materials, though it is not clear to what extent this applies to solar industries, which of course will not be the only industry affected by the proposed ban. Textiles industries, for example, would also be impacted by such legislation.
Global pressure mounts around forced labour issue
In her address to the lower house on Monday, Sharkie said it is estimated between 38 to 46 million people globally are subjected to modern slavery, of which more than 10 million are children.
“This bill is too important to be subject to the usual politicking of this House,” Sharkie said in her introduction. “It must not be sent off to committee to be left on the table to expire. We have the opportunity to actively join the international community and make a positive difference to the lives of the most disadvantaged people in the world.”
The proposed bill is a substantial progression on Australia’s Modern Slavery Act, which requires all businesses with an annual turnover of $100 million to publish “modern slavery statements” each year. The Act passed in 2018 and is due for its three year statutory review on Dec. 10.  While Australia’s Modern Slavery Act has been broadly welcomed, it is largely focussed on oversight and does not penalise companies that fail to comply.
“Australians would be horrified to know there is no law in place to stop goods made with forced labour ending up on our shelves. The Australian government should take this opportunity to strengthen its modern slavery laws, by introducing a robust and transparent forced labour ban that places the onus back onto importers to show their goods are slavery-free. We should all have confidence the goods we purchase are not made at the expense of other peoples freedom,” Freya Dinshaw, Senior Lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre said of the bill yesterday.
