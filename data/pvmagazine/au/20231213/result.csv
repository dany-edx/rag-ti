The pair plan to develop a range of large-scale projects, including wind, solar, battery and hybrid projects, Atmos said in the announcement.
“The partnership with Nomad is Atmos’ first investment in renewable energy in WA and provides a compelling opportunity to grow the company’s renewable energy investments in that state,” Atmos CEO, Nigel Baker, said.
Atmos Renewables holds interests in 15 large-scale renewable energy plants, including eight 100%-owned and two majority-owned projects. Meanwhile, Nomad Energy was a founder, shareholder and equity partner in Stellata Energy which developed Western Australia’s largest operating solar asset, the 132 MWp Merredin Solar Farm, though this project was not part of the Atmos – Nomad partnership.

They estimated the “extreme haze” caused by the smoke and fine particulate matter in the air across New South Wales (NSW) caused solar output to drop by around 35 to 175 GWh. This equates to financial losses between USD 4 million to 19 million, or $6.1 to $29 million, for rooftop and utility PV system owners and investors.
Authors of the study, Ethan Ford, Ian Marius Peters and Bram Hoex, analysed 30-minute energy data from 160 geographically separated residential PV systems in NSW with a total capacity of 312 kW between November 6, 2019 and January 15, 2020. The team also looked at 17 particulate matter sensors distributed across NSW. 
The total energy loss over the 71-day period for all 160 systems is estimated at about 4.2% to 0.8%. For one system in Wagga Wagga, the authors pointed wildfire smoke reduced PV power output by around 17% to 3% over the course of a “moderately hazy day (PM2.5 of 111 µg/m³).”
The study, to appear in the journal iScience, says “wildfire smoke attenuates solar irradiance and leads to soiling via the deposition of particles on the solar modules’ surfaces.” This impacts solar energy yield, which has implications for the reliability and commercial sustainability of PV installations, they added, especially as extreme wildfires are becoming more frequent as a result of climate change.
“Hence, a thorough and accurate understanding of how exactly wildfires impair PV output is vitally important for ensuring the service security of the future Australian power grid,” the authors said.
“As PV systems are sensitive to smoke and become ubiquitous, we propose employing them to support wildfire detection and monitoring,” they added.
The paper, ‘Quantifying the Impact of Wildfire Smoke on Solar Photovoltaic Generation in Australia,’ was conducted by researchers at UNSW’s School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering and the Forschungszentrum Jülich in Erlangen, Germany.

The two companies have agreed to work collaboratively to size and design gravitational energy storage systems. If found to be feasible, the partnership could deliver more than 100 MWh of storage within the greater Sydney metropolitan area, Green Gravity says. The study will also assess the positive impacts to mine closure, rehabilitation, and ecological impacts that Green Gravity’s technology can enable.

Headed up by former BHP executive Mark Swinnerton, Green Gravity is proposing to lift and release ultra heavy weights in legacy mine shafts to turn a turbine that creates electricity – essentially providing an alternative to pumped hydro or batteries without the need for water or chemicals. Swinnerton is adamant his company has distinct merits, many of which stem from the fact its concept is rooted in redeploying abandoned but very abundant infrastructure, lowering both the capital and environmental outlay of the projects.
This year, the startup signed similar deal with another miner, Yancoal, as well as with Romanian state-owned energy company Complexul Energetic Valea Jiului SA, seeking to examine opportunities in Europe. In total, these deals pertain to 23 different sites.
The company commissioned its Gravity Lab demonstration plant earlier this year in Port Kembla, also on the New South Wales south coast. “The facility enabled accelerated technical research, resulting in the need for site deployment studies,” Swinnerton said.
Of the Wollongong Resources partnership, he added: “Wollongong is an ideal location… the region has large industrial power demand combined with a rich coal mining history.”

“Green Gravity provides important diversification in the energy storage mix. The technology benefits from having no waste streams, minimal land and aesthetic impacts, and offers energy security benefits by reusing infrastructure we already have right here in Australia.”
Green Gravity’s technology is flexible in two keys ways, Swinnerton previously told pv magazine Australia. “The first one is the power of the system is associated with how fast we move the weights through the mine shafts. Of course a motor can go at different speeds, therefore we can elect to change the duration and ratings of that dynamically, if we need to.”
“We’re also designed to have multiple durations and we think these deep mine shafts [which can be double the height of the Sydney tower in depth] have a real opportunity for mid or long duration storage.”

PI Berlin, a technical adviser for PV projects has developed a root cause analysis (RCA) procedure to detect failures in operational inverters.
The company, now part of the Kiwa Group, said the new tool combines operational data review, field inspections, and on-site measurements with a Python-based tool that merges SCADA data and on-site information.
The new approach is implemented on the ground, where PI Berlin carries out forensic analysis. In addition, PI Berlin technicians interview the operators of PV plants.
“Beyond conventional practices, additional measurements are carried out to examine the operating characteristics of key elements such as capacitors, inductances and printed circuit boards,” a PI Berlin spokesperson told pv magazine. “Particular attention is paid to the evaluation of the actual switching of the IGBTs during operation.”
Researchers analysed PV plant documentation provided by clients, combining field inspections and SCADA data analysis. They used a Python tool to synthesise field measurements and plot graphs, streamlining the processing of operational data.
Root causes include problems such as defective printed circuit boards and communication failures.
“This procedure is useful for PV plant operators, PV plant owners or EPC companies whose warranty is still active,” the spokesperson said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/13/reconfigurable-series-parallel-photovoltaic-modules-with-high-shading-tolerance/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 13, 2023",Reconfigurable series-parallel photovoltaic modules with high shading tolerance,"From pv magazine Global
A group of researchers at the Netherlands’ Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) has developed a new design for reconfigurable PV modules that can reportedly provide a 10% higher energy yield than conventional shade-resilient PV panels with fixed interconnections and six bypass diodes in partial shading scenarios.
“Typically, a reconfigurable PV module consists of two or more blocks of solar cells that are connected to a switching matrix,” the scientists explained. “The switching matrix can dynamically modify the electrical interconnections between the blocks according to the illumination conditions and maximise the module’s output power.”
In the study “Electrical performance of a fully reconfigurable series-parallel photovoltaic module,” published in nature communications, the research group said their work represents the first attempt to validate reconfigurable modules using prototypes installed under realistic operating conditions.
The academics implemented switching matrix with MOSFETs, which they said allows the module to adopt 27 different series-parallel electrical configurations. These are classified as s1p6, s2p3, s3p2 and s6p1, with the first number indicating how many blocks are connected in series forming a string, and the second number indicating how many strings of series-connected blocks are connected in parallel.
The scientists said they could identify the best module configuration by considering illumination conditions via a synchronous reconfiguration algorithm, which measures the short-circuit current of the six blocks of cells.
“When the PV module is uniformly illuminated, configuration s6p1 is chosen since it delivers the lowest current and minimises Joule losses,” they explained. “On the other hand, when the PV module becomes partially shaded, configurations with parallel interconnected blocks will be chosen to reduce current mismatch losses.”
The team compared the performance of a prototype reconfigurable panel with that of a reference panel with fixed interconnections for four months under different shading conditions. “Different bar lengths were used to progressively shade and unshade the blocks during sunrise and sunset,” it said.
The tests showed that, without any shading, the reference panel produced 1.9% more energy than the reconfigurable module due to additional resistive losses in the latter’s switching matrix. By contrast, the reconfigurable PV module produced from 4.8% to 13.7% more power than the reference panel under shading conditions, and a higher average yield of 10.2%.
The group specified that the yield of the reconfigurable module doesn’t include energy consumed by the switching matrix and the sensing circuitry.”
“During all the shading experiments, about 40% of the energy was delivered by the s1p6 configuration, in which all six blocks of cells are connected in parallel,” the researchers stated.” Although the s1p6 is the most shading tolerant of the 27 possible configurations, it is also the one that generates the highest currents and thus may lead to the highest losses at system level.”
Looking forward, they said they want to test asynchronous algorithms and utilize a microcontroller in the  smart junction box.
