Fortescue Metals and its prominent chairman Andrew ‘Twiggy’ Forrest (also Australia’s richest man), recently wrapped up a world tour scouting green energy projects and resources, with a particular focus on green hydrogen. The company has rarely slipped out of the news cycle in recent months, announcing a slew of green hydrogen and decarbonisation plans.
So far this year, Fortescue has announced deals with South Korea and Brazil, and now it seems the company is budding plans in Jordan.
Fortescue are yet to put out media on the meeting, but according to the Jordanian Minister’s statement, the pair met “to explore and discuss investment opportunities… especially in the field of green hydrogen production and ammonia, with the aim of exporting to international markets.”
The Minister apparently gave the Fortescue delegation a presentation on the “attractive investment environment” in the Jordanian Kingdom and briefed the company on the government’s plans to promote the use of clean energy.
The Australian ambassador to Jordan also attended the meeting.
Fortescue became the giant it is today on the back of iron ore, but the company has now become vocal about embracing a green future. It recently set up Fortescue Future Industries, which wants to build a renewable energy portfolio of more than 235 GW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/14/wagga-solar-farm-extension-enabled-by-ppa-despite-cultural-artefact-destruction/,"BLOCKCHAIN,LEGAL,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 14, 2021",Wagga Solar Farm extension enabled by PPA despite Indigenous artefact destruction,"Greek company Mytilineos, which acquired Metka EGN in 2019 to form a separate division called Renewables and Storage Development Business Unit, will add a 23 MW extension to its Wagga Wagga Solar Farm.
The extension, which the company is calling Wagga 2, is a separate project that will be located next to Wagga Wagga Solar Farm (Wagga 1) and share common connection infrastructure, a spokesperson for Mytilineos told pv magazine Australia.
The solar farm made news in January after Indigenous stone manufacturing artefacts and hunting tools were destroyed while earthworks were conducted at the site. The company was fined $1500 for breaching its Aboriginal Heritage Impact Permit following the discovery.
Wiradjuri man Mark Saddler told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation the fine was far too low, saying it showed a complete disrespect for the cultural importance of the artefacts.
Metka EGN told pv magazine Australia that it “deeply regrets” the breach and has offered its unreserved apologies to the local Indigenous community. “At no time did Metka EGN intentionally damage Aboriginal objects. This incident was caused by an administrative error and, when potential disturbance of Aboriginal objects by preliminary works was identified, it immediately ceased all activity and self-reported the incident to the Department,” it said.
“Metka EGN is committed to following cultural heritage best-practice at all of its Australian projects, including early engagement with local Indigenous representatives. Since this incident, Metka EGN has improved internal protocols and procedures to ensure such an administrative error cannot be repeated and has commissioned cultural awareness training for all Wagga site employees, as well as subcontractors and service providers.”
Information about the Wagga Wagga Solar Farm is still available on the website of its original owner, Terrain Solar. Terrain Solar subsequently sold the project to Metka EGN which was absorbed into Mytilineos’ Renewables and Storage Development Business Unit in June 2019.
The 23 MW extension to the project was enabled by a 10-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) which Mytilineos signed with QEnergy, owned by Ion Limited, this week. Under the deal, QEnergy will purchase the majority of energy produced at Mytilineos’ Wagga North Solar Farm (Wagga 2), equipping the company to begin the extension this year.
The PPA, which allows organisations to lock in a price for electricity over an extended period, was secured through WePower’s energy trading platform, which is based on blockchain technology.
Mytilineos said the platform enabled it to introduce a new approach and method for buying and selling energy based on extroversion and innovation for the first time in Greece. WePower’s energy procurement platform is one of the largest of its kind and allows international transactions, making it particularly useful for companies like Mytilineos which has many international projects and has been vocal about wanting to extend its reach even further into the Australian market.
“Having worked through WePower’s standardised contracts and processes on the Wagga transaction, we envisage using WePower to market and contract other projects in our growing pipeline,” General Manager of the RSD Business Unit, Nikos Papapetrou, said in a statement.
The growing pipeline Papapetrou is referring to includes the 110 MW Moura Solar Farm in Queensland which Mytilineos acquired in December 2020. That very same month, the Greek company also bought the 75 MW Wyalong Solar Farm in New South Wales, both of which have PPAs in place – most notably with supermarket giant Coles.
Mytilineos also has another 120 MW in its Australian pipeline, with three projects under construction in NSW. As of December 2020, the company’s Australian portfolio sat at 400 MW.

Professor of solar economy Christian Breyer and his team, at the Lappeenranta University of Technology in Finland, have revised upwards their outlook on the share that solar PV will have in the global electricity mix by 2050, from 68% to 76%.
In the Low-cost renewable electricity as the key driver of the global energy transition towards sustainability study, the Finnish team utilised its energy system transition model to demonstrate the economic feasibility of a global energy market based on a 100% share of renewable energy, and predicted solar, thanks to a global installed capacity of around 63.38 TW, may even reach a 69% share for total primary energy supply by the end of the first half of the century.
In the proposed scenario, in which the target to limit global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius is achieved, end-use sectors such as transport and heating are almost fully electrified. Despite the strong drop in prices for electricity provided by solar and other renewables, however, the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of the whole system is expected to remain constant at between 50€ and 57 €/MWh (AU$78 and AU$89/MWh) over the next three decades, as the energy transition will be also implemented with storage technologies, increased flexibility and the production of synthetic fuels. “We do not consider, any more, single-technology LCOE, but least-cost energy system solutions, which shifts the focus on[to] integrated solutions,” Professor Breyer told pv magazine.
In the study, however, the capex of all technologies required for system LCOE was indicated. “The PV capex is the most decisive,” Breyer added.
According to the group’s estimations, for example, the capex for a residential PV project is forecast to drop from €1,169/kW-installed (AU$1825/kW-installed) in 2020, to €826 (AU$1290) in 2030, €650 (AU$1016) in 2040, and €537 (AU$840) in 2050.
The cost for commercial PV is expected to reach €397/kW-installed (AU$620/kW-installed) by 2050, from €907 (AU$1420) in 2020; €623 (AU$974) in 2030; and €484 (AU$756) in 2040.
As for the industrial roofs, the capex is predicted to decrease from €682/kW-installed (AU$1066/kW-installed) in 2020, to €459 (AU$717) in 2030, €353 (AU$550) in 2040, and €289 (AU$450) in 2050.
Looking into the large scale business, the group provided prices for two PV plants: fixed structure and with single-axis trackers, and found the second category will experience a price drop from €638/kW-installed (AU$997/kW-installed) in 2020 to €429 (AU$670) in 2030, €330 (AU$515) in 2040, and €271 (AU$423) in 2050. As for the first category, it is predicted to achieve a capex of €246/kW-installed (AU$384/kW-installed), from €580 (AU$906) in 2020; €390 (AU$609) in 2030; and €300 (AU$470) in 2040.
The report also forecasts that renewables-powered desalination will be able to resolve the water scarcity issue, providing 3 billion cubic meters of clean water per day, and that power-to-x technology will be fully implemented.
“The results in our study describe a scenario that has been claimed as impossible according to IPCC reports,” Breyer said. “We are, however, able to show that with … comprehensive direct and indirect electrification of the energy system, and renewables-based electricity supply, the climate targets can be met without increasing the [cost] per unit of energy.”
Two recent studies, on the other hand, have separately shown that Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios assessing global decarbonisation pathways are still predicting too-low future PV capacity and too-high LCOEs for the solar technology. A study from Aarhus University, in Denmark, has shown how the 2050 integrated assessment modelling (IAM) scenarios from the IPCC have underestimated PV over the past 14 years, and previous research conducted by scientists at the University of Geneva, in Switzerland, found that European entities expect a sharply higher compound annual growth rate for solar PV than their Asian and North American counterparts. It also noted that the growth scenarios of the IPCC are more conservative than other predictions.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/14/strong-growth-ahead-for-international-battery-storage-markets/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",,"APRIL 14, 2021",Strong growth ahead for international battery storage markets,"From pv magazine 04/2021
Large-scale battery deployment was subdued in the first quarter of 2020, but this slowdown was only temporary, as more than 1 GWh was deployed globally in each subsequent quarter. IHS Markit’s latest company and project database report highlighted the fourth quarter in 2020 as a record-breaking period, with more than 2.2 GWh of installations (not including residential). This brought the total in 2020 to over 5 GWh, compared to 3.2 GWh in the previous year.
Project sizes also increased significantly in 2020. In the United States, the Moss Landing project – built on the site of a former gas power plant – became the largest single-sited battery energy storage project. It even surpassed the 202.8 MWh Qinghai Solar Farm, which was completed earlier that year – although note that IHS Markit is tracking more than 5,200 projects in its project database and invites companies to submit project lists.
The first energy storage project above 100 MW came in 2017. It took another three years for both the 200 MW and 300 MW barriers to be broken. Projects in the order of 400 MW and above have been announced and are likely to be in operation before the end of 2025. Project sizes are increasing because they are inversely proportional to system prices, which have continued to decrease, making larger projects more economically feasible.
In 2021, the United States is forecast to account for 50% of the global market, following a threefold increase from 2020, as energy storage project owners take advantage of the federal solar investment tax credit (ITC). In Europe, a 70% increase in annual installations will be realised in 2021, driven by new frequency response, capacity market, and renewables co-location opportunities.
This year will be a record period for growth, but it also marks the start of a longer period of sustained growth for the industry through to 2030. Much of this growth will come from the front-of-the-meter segment, and we anticipate that larger utility-scale projects will become the real engines of growth for the energy storage industry in the coming years. The United States will continue to extend its dominance of the global market, gaining market share until 2023. However, from 2025, decarbonisation plans in mainland China will lead to rapid growth in the region, driving Asia Pacific to account for 44% of annual installations by 2030.

The IHS Markit residential energy storage index highlights that in the fourth and final quarter of 2020, shipments saw an increase of 19% quarter on quarter, and five countries reported shipments exceeding 100 MWh. Germany saw shipments fall significantly in the final quarter of the year as inventory was cleared and system suppliers waited for delivery of batteries.
In 2020, both Germany and the United States recorded shipments of over 1 GWh. Tesla ranked first in terms of capacity because of its dominance of the U.S. market, but also geographic coverage. Sonnen was the leading supplier on a MWh basis in Germany (the largest market) in 2020.
In the latter stages of 2020, customers in Germany, Italy, and the United States were experiencing delays of between three and nine months, as demand had begun to exceed supply. Installations in 2021 are expected to rise to 1.6 GW/4.1 GWh, representing a year-on-year increase of 26%, after deployments in 2020 surpassed 1 GW for the first time (1.3 GW/3.2 GWh – annual installations in 2020). Self-consumption of rooftop solar PV generation and backup power continue to be the main drivers for new installations, as markets with support schemes keep growing rapidly.
In the short term, subsidy schemes will drive deployment, encouraging installations as solar and storage is supported. Current leading markets – Australia, Germany, Japan, and the United States – all have the same things in common: They have strong solar markets with schemes in place to encourage new and retrofit storage installations.
Toward 2030, the introduction of other revenue streams will aid future deployment. Aggregation, community balance structures, and enabling access to wholesale or capacity markets will allow owners of home battery energy storage systems the ability to stack revenue streams.
The C&I space continues to lag behind other sectors, despite promising economic value propositions for businesses. A short-lived boom in 2018, caused by lucrative renewable energy credits for renewable generation paired with storage, saw 71% of all global installations deployed in South Korea. Hindered by fires related to poor cell production – as well as the integration and management of operational systems – South Korea accounted for 35% and 24% of global C&I installations in 2019 and 2020, respectively. That was before the expiry of the REC scheme, and ultimately the demise of the C&I storage opportunity, at the end of 2020.
Globally, the C&I sector has undergone rapid consolidation, as many key players have pivoted, exited the industry, or been acquired. The developers with the strongest project pipelines through early 2021 all have access to capital from their parent companies.
The storage sector has overcome the short-term project delays caused by Covid-19. However, the long-term economic consequences of the pandemic will have a significant impact on developers’ end markets and sales pipelines. The major challenge for C&I energy storage is that the economic benefits vary significantly from customer to customer. This makes it very difficult to offer a standardised solution, which, in turn, increases the cost of building systems and acquiring customers.
California continues to lead in C&I storage deployments, which are bolstered by the state’s strong incentive programs and high demand charges. IHS Markit forecasts that the state will capture more than 50% of the North American market in 2025. The sector will lag behind the residential sector until 2030, when it is forecast to surpass it with annual installations of 3.5 GW/9.5 GWh.

Battery materials startup Group 14 Technologies has brought its first commercial-scale factory online in the northwest United States. The factory can produce up to 120 tons per year of the company’s innovative silicon-carbon material SCC55, designed as a direct replacement for graphite in lithium-ion batteries.
Since it has around 10 times the energy density of graphite, silicon has attracted plenty of attention from researchers as a potential anode material for lithium-ion batteries. Challenges with the material’s tendency to expand when used in batteries, however, have largely held back commercial applications until now.
Group 14 says that by focusing on large-scale solutions from the start it has been able to design a material that can both be produced at large-scale and serve as a ‘drop in’ solution for battery manufacturers already working with graphite. “We leveraged our team’s deep commercial manufacturing experience to prioritise process development and designing for cost from the beginning,” said CTO Rick Costantino. “The process to manufacture SCC55 was designed from the start to be scaled quickly and efficiently, an approach that has kept us on track to bring our technology online to help power consumer electronics, electric vehicles and more — immediately.”
The material consists of a carbon “scaffold”, inside which is a 3-5 nanometer particle of amorphous silicon. Void space inside the scaffold gives the silicon some room to expand, while the carbon surface creates a stable interface with the electrolyte. Batteries using only SCC55 as the anode have shown stability over more than 500 cycles. It can also be combined with graphite in various ratios for stability over 1000-2000 cycles, with customers able to find the optimal balance. “We have a lot of customers looking at the blending approach, and others also working only with our material to get a 50% plus boost to their battery capacity,” Group 14 CEO Rick Luebbe told pv magazine. “So with all of the billions being invested in Li-ion, our material can be integrated seamlessly.”
Group 14 has not shared information on the cost of its material, though says it will be competitive with graphite when the improved performance is taken into account.
The company says it has already delivered SCC55 to consumer electronics and vehicle manufacturers around the world, and that battery manufacturers are currently validating for use of the material in electric vehicle batteries.
And Group 14 already has plans for more manufacturing, expecting to double its capacity by the end of this year. It has partnered with solar polysilicon producer REC Silicon, taking advantage of its large capacity to produce silane gas. Group 14 also plans to break ground on a new factory at its Moses Lake site later in 2021. “We built our technology for real-world impact,” says CEO Rick Luebbe. “This commercial factory is the first big step forward towards fulfilling our mission, and we’re excited to play our part to ensure more equitable access to cleaner electric vehicles of all forms.”

Ever falling solar project costs are set to flatten out around 2035, according to a new publication by Norwegian quality assurance and risk management company DNV.
The More than the sun: The solar outlook report emphasises the need for solar developers and investors to start focusing on driving up the value of the electricity generated, to avoid dwindling returns caused by price cannibalisation. Increasing competition between developers and falling hardware costs are fast driving down the levelised cost of energy generated by rising global volumes of solar generation capacity, reducing profits for investors.
Faced with that prospect, developers can try to bear down further on costs and/or provide better quality electricity by firming its supply and dispatchability. Digitalisation can address both strategies with, of course, DNV offering a range of such services.
While the price cannibalisation issue has been around for a while, DNV has predicted when it will start to kick in and posited 2035 as the point at which reductions in module and inverter costs and, separately, total solar project costs will level off.
Though the report estimates the current global average $250/kW module-plus-inverter cost–and $725/kW total project expense–will fall to around $120/kW and $412.50/kW, respectively, by mid century, the associated graph offers little change after 2035.
Similarly, DNV predicts the volume of new solar generation capacity deployed in Europe and North America will begin to slow from 2030 and will plateau from 2040, thanks to price cannibalisation. The company noted the solar ‘duck curve‘ already seen in PV-rich California, which sees gas peaker plants ramped up as electricity demand rises in the evening, as well as the grid capacity constraints which have delayed solar deployment in Australia.
Referring to its 2020 Energy Transition Outlook report, DNV reiterates the prediction the world will have 1.5 TW of solar capacity by 2026 and 2.9 TW by 2030 but adds, in one chapter heading: “Solar’s success won’t depend solely on the lower cost or greater nameplate efficiency of the hardware,” but will also require greater dispatchability through the use of short and long term energy storage, demand response, and smarter inverters.
