That figure grows to 35% by 2050.
Solar, alongside natural gas, is far and away the most vulnerable of all the generation types, the Index noted. It found that for solar, 95% of dedicated sites were in one of the three highest risk categories due to susceptibility to events like storms and hail.
As Zurich’s APAC CEO, Justin Delaney, noted: “much of the focus to date has centred on the risk of the energy grid to climate change, rather than on the risk of climate change to the grid.”
But the climate is changing and unfortunately a grid based on renewable generation is vulnerable to these changes. How to future-proof Australian solar farms was discussed by representatives from insurance company AON, lender Commonwealth Bank, developers Engie and Energy Estate, contractor PCL, and equipment supplier Nextracker at All-Energy trade show in Melbourne in October. There was unanimous consensus among panelists that much more attention needs to be given to future-proofing in light of growing weather risks.

This is especially pertinent since a number of Australian states are putting Renewable Energy Zones (REZs) at the heart of their transition plans, and aggregating assets also aggregates risk.
Australia has already seen fire warnings around big energy nodes. Climate change is also anticipated to make parts of Australia more arid, meaning the problems of dust soiling and flooding are set to grow.
Solar’s biggest weather threat though is hail. “Hail is dwarfing everything,” Nextracker’s Vice President of Global Asset Management, Andrew Griffiths, said during that panel. “That’s become sort of the first order problem I think the industry needs to solve.” 
From the south of Sydney to above Bundaberg in Queensland is Australia’s ‘hail alley’ – but the fact this coast is among Australia’s most populated stretches means renewable generation is needed here. Traversing this tension is only becoming tricker with some insurers refusing to cover for hail, or severely limiting their coverage. “From an insurance perspective, we’re definitely starting to see [a gap] develop,” said Pat Behan from insurer AON.

Extreme hail, storms and other weather events will inevitably happen, probably with increasing regularity. This, in turn, will result in higher insurance premiums – which are already today threatening the bankability of some projects. “We certainly are seeing insurers that are now sort of either blanket carving out flooding and hail events or, or perhaps sort of taking a more limited approach to it,” Anna Hedgcock, Engie’s Head of Portfolio Growth and Commercial in Australia, said.
Or, as Gopinath Govindraj, Country Manager at construction company PCL, put it: “it’s like seeking insurance for pre-existing medical condition, which means that no coverage, or partial health [coverage] and then the gap risk is left for someone else to foot.” These gaps can sometimes equate to hundreds of millions of dollars, with Behan flagging a $300 million solar farm which could only get hail coverage up to $20 – 30 million.

While weather risk and future-proofing are front of mind for insurance companies, signified by widespread changes to coverage and growing premiums, other stakeholders have spent a lot less time with these questions. Simon Currie, Cofounder & Chief Projects Officer at renewable developer Energy Estate, pointed out he has never been asked by a bank about a project’s future-proofing strategies.
Hedgcock also noted that while global giant Engie has spent a lot of time looking at climate modelling and data, that information isn’t necessarily extrapolated to assess potential future risks on individual projects. While there is certainly a growing maturity, most industry stakeholders have a ways to go to ensure projects are as future-proof as possible, the panel agreed. 
While, of course, no one controls the weather, there are a number of design and operational choices that can been made to minimise project risk. Opting for technologies that, say, are designed to address particular weather events and fitted with responsive software is something the Commonwealth Bank’s Executive Director of Natural Resources & Energy, Neil Fraser, described as “absolutely crucial.” 
“From a bankability perspective, we would far prefer to see the mitigation or risk minimisation strategy than having to go for insurance rectifications,” Fraser added.
This year, Nextracker launched its Hail Pro solution which the company says automatically moves modules into an optimised vertical stow position in about 60 seconds across an entire plant. The software can be adjusted based on the project owner’s requirements and the kind of hail predictions they feel comfortable with. In other words, the automated stowing can be adjusted to be more or less risk averse.

Nextracker’s Andrew Griffiths also pointed to shifts in the solar module market to address weather risks. “We’ve seen thicker modules now for glass, people going way beyond the IEC [International Electrotechnical Commission] testing standards for modules, which I think is important as we’re seeing these severe storms, or convective storms causing larger size, larger diameter, hail stones.” Hail is becoming a particularly fierce problem in the US, where Nextracker is based. Hail related losses exceeded USD 1 billion ($1.5 billion) there in 2021 alone.
Panelists also agreed more weather stations close to projects and particularly throughout Renewable Energy Zones would be helpful to ensure weather data accuracy. “We are going to be clustered around these areas, we’ve actually got to go and collectively invest in the weather stations, so that we’re getting as much predictive analytics as we can… and that helps our communities as well,” Energy Estate’s Simon Currie said.
PCL’s Gopinath Govindraj said that from his own experience, localised weather stations are important, noting situations where the nearest station might be over 20 kilometres away and predicts storms which in fact never hit the project area.
Self-insuring was also raised as a possible path away from skyrocketing insurance premiums. “While certainly self-insurances is one option, that’s not, I think, really easy for many developers to do, and I think you really have the portfolio to be able to do that,” Engie’s Anna Hedgcock said.
There is no easy solution to weather risk, nor can any project be certain about severity. For this reason, panelists united around the importance of having frank discussions early across the entire stakeholder chain. 
As it stands, AON’s Pat Behan says the discussions and relationships have tended to be advisorial, but he wants to see them become more collaborative. To his eyes, that means doing things like explaining to the raft of stakeholders how technological solutions like hardware and software function. “That is working with the financiers, the lenders, to kind of demonstrate how these products work, and how they work in conjunction with each other,” Behan said.
He also flagged the intractability of weather risk in a rapidly changing climate might mean insurance products change. “It might look a little bit different than what a traditional insurance product will be, but it’ll end up providing the same level of compensation at the end of the day. That feeds back into that that bankability as well,” he added.
Panelists said fostering relationships between insurers and equipment manufacturers and developers could lead to better leveraging of important information. That is, insurers have huge amounts of data from their global books outlining the types of weather events and losses in particular areas. This information could help both manufacturers as well as project developers make more informed decisions in the product development and design stages respectively. 
Commercial considerations means contractors and developers working on projects within the same area are rarely in discussions with one another, Currie pointed out. Given weather events will likely impact all projects in the same vicinity, Currie said industry needs to breed more openness on the topic, and on mitigate strategies, even among competitors. 
Developers and project owners also need to become more transparent about how they are assessing their projects. As PCL’s Gopinath Govindraj said: “We don’t know if all the location risks, given the weather challenges, are factored into the business model or strictly based on providing convincing CAPEX and OPEX model to the lenders.”
Following these discussions, there needs to be greater recognition around the value of future-proofing projects, Engie’s Hedgecock noted. “As developers, I think we do want to employ best practices and future projects,” she said. 
“But the reality is that the the returns on these projects are on a knife edge – it’s so hard to get these projects up. So if we’re going to make an investment like that [future-proofing via design, operational and technology choices], then I want to know that it’s going to be recognised in the terms I get from all the other stakeholders,” she added.
This topic of risk sharing – of better allocating risk along the whole chain – was paramount in the discussion. Extreme weather impacts everyone – grid operators, consumers, project proponents, insurers and lenders, yet many felt the project contractors and owners had to shoulder all the responsibility for mitigation and, in the event of an incident, also the losses. 
“There comes mitigation plans, due diligence, product selection, technologies, division – everything is at this stage as we stand,” PCL’s Gopinath Govindraj said. “There is a misalignment of lack of equitable risk understanding and allocation.”

Energy Estate’s Simon Currie echoed this, saying: “I cannot believe the attitude that people are happy to have EPC [engineering, procurement and construction] contractors go under and not make decent margins. We’re gonna kill ourselves guys – we’ve got to fix us at the net, we’ve got to get the risk allocation right.”
“They [contractors] have to make money and you can’t expect them to take unreasonable risks,” Currie added.
Off-takers, those signing the power purchasing agreements, also need to mature their understanding of the risks, panelists agreed. A race to the bottom on price only undercuts project quality. Panelists agreed there was a dire need to educate off-takers that a cheaper project is a more vulnerable project, which ultimately is not in their interest either.
“We have to be as industry prepared to spend the money to build better projects,” Currie said. “Particularly if we’re talking about 35 year assets, which will catch up on us into the future,” he added.
“I think this goes back to the off-taker being in that conversation as well, because ultimately the revenue that you’re going to drive off your project is going to allow you to do different things at that design and build stage,” Behan added. “If you’ve got a little bit more margin… you can do more in terms of that upfront development.”
Industry’s ability to work through these tricky problems with maturity also has stakes beyond Australia’s borders, Currie noted. “We are massive fans of Australia as an export hub… If the Japanese and the Koreans are relying on us, how will we continue to be a trusted supplier if we haven’t thought about how we mitigate extreme weather events?”
On November 29, pv magazine is hosting a panel discussion webinar on ‘Balancing the books on big solar’s weather risk,’ where we will plunge into this topic in greater depth, also giving audience members the opportunity to pose questions to panelists.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/23/pacific-green-unveils-1-5-gwh-big-battery-plans-for-south-oz/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,UNITED KINGDOM",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 23, 2023",Pacific Green unveils 1.5 GWh big battery plans for South Oz,"Pacific Green has unveiled plans to develop what would be South Australia’s largest grid-scale battery energy storage system with the proposed Limestone Coast Energy Park to comprise a 500 MW, three-hour (1.5 GWh) battery energy storage system.
The company said it expects to commence construction in 2024 having secured exclusive rights to a site adjacent to the 275 kVA South East Substation near Mount Gambier, about 400 kilometres southeast of Adelaide. Pacific Green said the site is “strategically located” with the substation linking to the Heywood Interconnector that connects the electricity grids in South Australia and Victoria.
Joel Alexander, managing director of Pacific Green’s Australian arm, said the big battery will “significantly strengthen” the region’s grid stability and increase the flow of renewable energy between South Australia and Victoria.
“Our Limestone Coast Battery Energy Park can act as a load during the day, increasing the viability of even more solar and wind generation, whilst shifting energy to the times it is most valuable in the evening peak,” he said.
The Limestone Coast battery project is currently going through the approvals process and Pacific Green said once operational, the facility will have the capacity to store nearly 60% of South Australia’s residential solar output for up to a four-hour period.
“This momentum allows us to accelerate progress towards South Australia achieving 100% net renewables by 2030,” Alexander said.
The Limestone Coast Energy Park development is the first of several proposed battery projects Pacific Green has planned for Australia with the company aiming to build a “multi-gigawatt platform” that will be deployed across the country.
The second of those projects is likely to be built at Portland in Victoria with Pacific Green confirming it has secured the project rights to develop a 1 GW/2.5 GWh battery energy storage system in the state’s southwest.
The company said it has entered into an exclusivity agreement to secure land for the project with development approval expected to begin early in 2024. It is anticipated construction of the Portland Energy Park will commence later that year, with the battery to begin operations in 2026.
“Since launching Pacific Green’s Australian office in Melbourne last year, we have initially focused on building an experienced management team to create our platform,” Alexander said.
“By acquiring this site and project rights, we have now positioned Pacific Green to become one of the largest battery park developers in the Southern Hemisphere.”
Pacific Green’s Limestone Coast Energy Park announcement comes after Danish investment group Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) unveiled its plans to build the 240 MW/480 MWh Summerfield Battery Energy Storage System in South Australia’s Murraylands region.
The two companies are among a host of international players exploring battery energy storage opportunities in Australia, including BlackRock’s Akaysha Energy, Macquarie’s Eku Energy, Spanish energy major Iberdrola, and French renewable energy giants Neoen and Engie.

Canadian Solar will supply its Solbank technology for the battery energy storage system with CIP saying a final investment decision on the project is due next year, with construction to begin by 2025.
CIP said the Summerfield project will initially have two hours of storage but there is scope for expansion to meet future market demand.
“The 240 MW Summerfield battery will provide much-needed storage and grid stability, storing excess supply during low demand periods and delivering power back to the grid when it is needed most,” the company said. “This is vital to maintaining a reliable and affordable electricity supply to South Australia, Victoria and the wider national energy grid.”
The project is being developed on land at Tepko, about 60 kilometres east of Adelaide. CIP said the site is “strategically positioned” on the proposed 275 kV South East transmission line expansion which will bring in new renewable generation from the South East Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).
“We are excited about the role this battery will play in ensuring continued energy reliability for South Australians, and to be a catalyst for the transmission investment needed to unlock the South East Renewable Energy Zone,” CIP Australia head Jørn Hammer said.
“This is an easy win as far as transmission investment goes.”
CIP said the Summerfield battery is the first of multiple large-scale battery projects it has planned for Australia and part of a $100 billion development pipeline that includes offshore and onshore wind, renewable hydrogen, pumped hydro and battery storage.
A leading player in developing renewable energy projects in Europe, CIP is seeking to expands its presence in Australia to capitalise on opportunities in the energy transition.
Among the projects in its portfolio is the proposed Bowen Renewable Energy Hub project, a 1.4 GW integrated energy generation and storage project being developed in Queensland, and the gigawatt-scale Evergreen green hydrogen production hub planned for South Australia’s Eyre Peninsula.
It is also developing the 2.2 GW Star of the South offshore wind project off the Victorian coastline and the 5.2 GW Murchison Hydrogen Renewables project being developed near the Western Australian coastal town of Kalbarri.

The initial aim of the CIS, signed off by the Commonwealth, and all state and territory governments in December 2022, was to drive investment in 6 GW of “dispatchable” clean power projects. That ambition will now be lifted to 9 GW of storage capacity and 23 GW of variable renewable generation, for a total of 32 GW nationally.
“This investment will supercharge available power in the energy grid, delivering the long-term reliable, affordable and low-emissions energy system Australians deserve as our grid changes,” Bowen said in a statement.
The CIS, to be delivered in cooperation with the states and territories, involves the government underwriting new investments in renewable generation and storage through ‘contract for differences’ that are won through a competitive tender.
These contracts include pre-agreed floors and ceilings for revenue earned by any one project. If the revenue is lower than agreed, the federal government pays the shortfalls, guaranteeing projects a baseline income. If revenues exceed the agreed price ceiling, the government will take a share of profits.
Bowen said the scheme seeks to provide certainty for renewable investors which has historically impeded the progress of renewable generation and storage projects.
“We’ve had some very good progress, but we need more progress,” he said. “We’ve got a massive pipeline of renewable energy investment in Australia. But we want it moving to final investment decision more quickly, and we want it making its way through the planning systems more quickly, and really, what we’re announcing today will see that happen.”
“It’s also an indication that we are competing in a world very hungry for capital, hungry for supply chain elements where every country in the world really is on the same journey as us, moving to a very high proportion of renewables, and we’ve got to make sure Australia is as certain and as welcoming an investment environment as we can for renewable energy.”
The expanded CIS will hold auctions at six monthly intervals until 2027, in partnership with those state and territory governments that sign onto renewable energy transition plans. The first of the auctions is expected to be launched in April 2024.
The government said the costs of the CIS contracts will not be disclosed to ensure that the “reverse auctions achieve the best bang for buck for taxpayers.”
“We need to keep bidders with their pencils sharp, we want them competing against everyone else and not knowing what the Commonwealth expects,” Bowen said.
CIS tenders have already been rolled out in South Australia and Victoria, and in New South Wales (NSW) where the results of the first pilot auction were announced this week. The successful projects, three large batteries and three virtual power plants, will deliver more than 1 GW of dispatchable power across the state.
“I think that shows what sort of results we can achieve with a well‑designed, well-calibrated policy like the one we’re announcing today,” Bowen said.
As well as delivering its portion of the underwriting, the federal government said it will negotiate agreements with the states and territories to ensure renewables are rolled out and reliability is enhanced through objective benchmarks, an orderly transition, and potential strategic reserves.
The federal government said 18 GW of the 32 GW capacity offered under the expanded CIS will be subject to these bilateral agreements. Capacity may be re-allocated from any jurisdictions that don’t make agreements to those that do.
Commonwealth underwriting will only support renewable projects but the individual jurisdictions can determine the form of the strategic reserve.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/23/perc-inventor-from-unsw-discusses-the-future-of-the-technology/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"NOVEMBER 23, 2023",PERC inventor from UNSW discusses the future of the technology,"pv magazine: What role do you feel PERC will play in the longer term now that alternative technology such as tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon), heterojunction (HJT) and back-contact solar are vying to displace PERC and become the next mainstream PV choice?
Aihua Wang: The solar industry is developing rapidly. The pace of technology development is faster than ever, which puts pressure on the industry to find ways to increase efficiency, scale up and reduce costs. PERC cells’ low manufacturing cost and high performance means they have the majority market share.
Over the past 35 years, PERC cell research has underpinned significant progress and paved the way for new materials, processes, and structures such as TOPCon and HJT – technologies that bring further advantages.
I can envision that as the industry continues to progress and its scale increases, new technologies will continue to emerge and evolve. Nevertheless, the fundamental principles that have proven to be so effective for PERC cell technology also apply to these new structural innovations.
Do you think perovskite solar devices will ever become a viable, mass-produced option for solar power generation?
Perovskite solar cell technology has developed rapidly within a short timeframe. Ongoing research efforts are focused on enhancing stability, scalability, and overall performance. In contrast to silicon, perovskite materials exhibit sensitivity to moisture, potentially leading to degradation over time. Addressing stability and scaling issues is therefore paramount but such efforts require time and cost efficiency. There is a lot yet to be discovered with perovskite solar technology but it is a novel and promising method.
What is your experience as a female engineer in the solar sector?
Personally, I try not to pay much attention to my gender. In a competitive environment, special treatment ought not to be the norm. However, within the semiconductor industry, of which solar cell technology is a part, female engineers who I’ve worked with have shared several traits that provide an advantage in this discipline. Whether it is their impressive attention to detail, an instinctive understanding of when the direction of an experiment or observation needs to change, or the tenacious pursuit of the goal, I know many female engineers who are as consistently brilliant as their male counterparts.
I have had the privilege of knowing many brilliant female engineers in the solar sector who collectively drive rapid progress in the industry.
My goal has always been to perform my job and work together with fellow researchers to the best of my abilities. Australia and its institutions have provided many opportunities to pursue my goals and the QEPrize has recognized me and my colleagues for achieving them. For this, I am eternally grateful.
 What does it mean to be the first female winner of the QEPrize?
There are a lot of bright and talented young women in every corner of the globe but it is true that only a small proportion pursue careers in engineering. Accomplished female engineers who have achieved success in our profession can serve as role models not only to aspiring engineers but to all young people who are curious and who want to make an impact and have fun while doing so. Making female-led accomplishments in science and engineering more visible is vital if we are to inspire a new generation of women in engineering – hence the importance of accolades like the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. Our discipline will not reach its full potential without more women in the sector and so I hope that more are encouraged to achieve remarkable things through engineering, cultivating a brighter future and making contributions to both their communities and humanity. As the first female recipient of the QEPrize, I hope that this achievement increases the visibility of women in engineering and inspires more brilliant minds to explore the boundless realm of creativity within this field.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/23/northvolt-unveils-160-wh-kg-sodium-ion-battery/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SWEDEN,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"NOVEMBER 23, 2023",Northvolt unveils 160 Wh/kg sodium-ion battery,"From pv magazine Global
Northvolt, Europe’s battery manufacturing torchbearer, has announced the development of its first-generation sodium-ion battery cells. They are designed to provide the foundation for the company’s next-generation energy storage solutions, with subsequent generations to deliver higher energy density, opening opportunities to enable cost-efficient electric mobility solutions.
Its sodium-ion technology has been validated at more than 160 Wh/kg at its R&D and industrialisation campus, Northvolt Labs, in Västerås, Sweden. This level of performance makes the technology competitive with today’s dominant energy storage chemistry – lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries.
“Thanks to the global abundance of ingoing materials as well as the robustness and sustainability of the sodium-ion technology, Northvolt sees sodium-ion technology as a key part of the company’s product portfolio in the long term,” Wilhelm Löwenhielm, Northvolt senior director of business development ESS, told pv magazine. “With its first-generation sodium-ion product, Northvolt will bring to market a solution at scale that is competitive with LFP solutions. Over time, the technology is expected to surpass LFP significantly in terms of cost-competitiveness.”
According to Löwenhielm, Northvolt aims to address the energy storage market with a complete plug & play battery solution to allow for fast market entry and scale-up.
“Key activities for bringing this particular technology to market is scaling the supply chain for battery grade materials, which Northvolt is currently doing together with key partners,” he said.
So far, the company has revealed few details about the technology’s performance.
“We’ve also demonstrated the cell’s robustness and cycle life – something that’s key for energy storage systems,” the company said on its website, without providing any hard figures.
However, Northvolt has said that its sodium-ion cell is based on a hard carbon anode and a Prussian White-based cathode, which makes it similar to the first generation of sodium-ion cells unveiled by Chinese battery industry heavyweight CATL in 2021.
At the time of the launch, CATL said it had been dedicated to the research and development of sodium-ion battery electrode materials for many years. It also revealed plans to establish a basic industrial chain by 2023.
It said its first generation of sodium-ion battery cells could achieve energy densities of up to 160Wh/kg and promised an increase to 200 Wh/kg for the next generation. Earlier this year, it confirmed that China’s Chery will become the the first automaker to use its sodium-ion battery tech.
“At the surface level, it should be the same technology as announced by CATL in 2021, but the Chinese manufacturer is also pursuing layered oxide cathodes as well – both with similar performances (160 Wh/kg),” Max Reid, principal electric vehicle and battery analyst at Wood Mackenzie, told pv magazine. “In the early days of sodium-ion, it makes sense for a company like CATL to keep developing several technologies and attempt to overcome the challenges of each to hedge its bets.”
Northvolt, on the other hand, has adhered to nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) battery chemistry, which is favored by electric-vehicle customers. The company’s ESS platform is based on the same chemistry, which is seen as less sustainable than LFP due to cobalt and nickel content.
The Swedish startup, which has secured the backing of big investors such as Volkswagen, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs since its establishment in 2016, has however always claimed that it is building the world’s greenest lithium-ion batteries with a minimal CO2 footprint.
The company has managed to reduce its lithium-ion cell carbon footprint to 33 kg CO2/kWh — a two-thirds reduction compared to an industry reference. Its goal, however, is to establish 150 GWh of annual cell production by 2030 at 10 kg CO2/kWh with 50% of material for its lithium-ion cells coming from recycling.
In December 2021, Northvolt bacame the first manufacturer to produce battery cells fully designed, developed and assembled by a homegrown European battery company. Those first cells rolled off its manufacturing lines at Northvolt Ett – its first gigafactory, in northern Sweden, which has an installed capacity of 16 GWh. In the meantime, the company has revealed plans for three more plants in Germany, Canada and Sweden.
Northvolt has also been engaged in development of energy-dense lithium-metal battery technology for aviation and high-performance vehicles at its subsidiary Cuberg based in San Leandro, California. The Stanford University spinoff has developed a 20 Ah commercial-format lithium metal pouch cell with an energy density of 405 Wh/kg and integrated those cells into an aviation-specific battery module offering gravimetric and volumetric energy density of 280 Wh/kg and 320 Wh/L respectively.
Around a year ago, Northvolt announced an investment in Altris, a Swedish tech company that has developed a proprietary technology to produce Fennac (Prussian White), a key component in sodium-ion batteries that consists of sodium, iron carbon and nitrogen.
In October, Altris announced a milestone in its technology development, presenting a 160 Wh/kg sodium-ion battery cell.
“Now, we have our eyes set on achieving 200 Wh/kg and beyond, while keeping our chemistry pure and sustainable”, said Björn Mårlid, CEO of Altris.
Northvolt, which developed its sodium-ion cells in partnership with Altris, said that its focus is on the industrialisation of this technology and developing solutions for its integration into energy storage solutions for global deployment.
“The low cost and safety at high temperatures make the technology especially attractive for energy storage solutions in upcoming markets including India, the Middle East and Africa,” the company said in a press release.
The industry placed high hopes were placed on sodium-ion battery technology due to last year’s price increases and predicted lithium-ion battery material shortfalls. Although the initial hype has waned, with prices returning to a downward trajectory, sodium-ion technology is still considered a viable alternative to lithium-ion batteries.
The two battery technologies have much in common in terms of structure and working principles and can often even use the same manufacturing lines and equipment. However, sodium-ion offers superior environmental credentials, enhanced safety, and better raw material costs than lithium-ion. Generally, Na-ion cells are quoted to be even up to 40% cheaper, but the challenge is bringing the technology to scale.
