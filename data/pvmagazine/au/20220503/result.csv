Andy McCarthy, CEO of RACV Solar said his company – which has one of the industry’s largest in-house teams – has certainly grappled with the issue. “Everyone has,” he told pv magazine Australia.
McCarthy said the shortages are so pervasive the best members of his team are getting approached weekly by companies looking to recruit. 
The situation has led RACV Solar to pursue a range of measures. In April, the company acquired the Cola Solar, having bought Great Ocean Solar and Electrical not long before. These were, McCathy said, “capability acquisition as much as pipeline acquisitions.”

Which is to say, their workforces were among these companies most valuable assets. This approach, McCarthy noted, requires not only strong due diligence but is really only available to companies big enough to fork out major capital.
A sentiment Kosta Bourandanis, co-founder of industry group Solar Cutters, echoed, telling pv magazine Australia that while big companies have been able to cope, smaller companies are struggling and some are even stalling, unable to find enough workers to keep up with demand.
Platinum Solar Designs, a small and exclusively in-house solar company based on the New South Wales south coast, is one such example. “We’re stuck and we’ve been stuck now for about two years,” general manager Scott Mason, who formerly founded and owned Australian Solar Designs, told pv magazine Australia. 
The system of Clean Energy Council (CEC) accreditations is where Mason thinks the real heart of the issue lays. To be precise, it isn’t so much that Mason is struggling to find staff (though that is also true), but rather that his business can’t keep staff.
The primary reason for this retention problem, he says, is that as soon as young electricians finish their apprenticeships, they can become CEC accredited installers within a matter of days. With this accreditation, they can earn much more money subcontracting for big solar companies like Sunboost and Arise Solar. 
Why work for $45 an hour, Mason said, when it’s possible to earn as much as $1600 per job installing as a sole trader?

His company now has to watch the amount of sales it makes because it refuses to use subcontractors, a practice Mason believes disables proper quality control. “My business cannot grow because I’ve only got a certain amount of CEC accredited people within my business and at the end of the day, it falls on that number. I can only do so many solar installations a week because I’ve only got so many solar installers that are CEC accredited.”
He believes this system where it is easy and lucrative to work as a sole trader is depressing the quality of the solar industry in Australia. Newly finished apprentices, even if they are legally permitted through the current accreditation process, are too inexperienced to be signing off on installs, Mason says, and are the reason why pages like ‘Crap Solar’ exist.
“This a problem the CEC has created,” Mason said. “It’s too easy to get a CEC license.”

The Clean Energy Council responded by noting Australia’s labour market has widely suffered skills shortages. “So this challenge is not unique to rooftop solar, it’s an issue right across Australia,” Anita Talberg, the CEC Director of workforce development told pv magazine Australia. 
“There needs to be a bigger pool of licensed accredited electricians available to work in installation, and this is something the Clean Energy Council is actively tackling on many different fronts.”
Mason believes, however, the Council should be more stringent about who it accredits rather than less. “The industry doesn’t have skill shortage, the problem is they’re off by themselves,” he said. “We’re pushing the market into sole trader type workers.” 
Mason believes the industry has found itself in a position where its regulatory system has enabled companies with the most aggressive marketing tactics offering rock bottom pricing to thrive while higher quality teams with in-house staff and aftercare services are being thwarted and cannot grow.
Facebook
“It’s a monopoly game now,” Mason said. “I don’t see [solar] as an electrical field – it’s crazy I say that and it’s a shame to say that.” 
Much of Platinum’s work now involves fixing “stuff ups” from large companies, Mason said. “We’re finding the quality of workmanship is getting worse.”
This quality crisis, he added, is more pronounced in the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment than in residential. The reason for this, Mason believes, is because most installers have been trained as residential electricians and have rarely or never worked on industrial sites – a whole different ballgame to houses.
“We’ve got to lift the quality within our industry. But the problem is, we can’t do that due to the structure the CEC has made.”
Mason believes it could help to put a limit on the number of sole trader installations permitted, saying this would force retailers to take more care with ensuring quality. Beyond that, he hopes the takeover of the Clean Energy Regulator as the solar industry’s sole regulator will help ease the issue. He is particularly eager for accreditation processes to be revised.
While RACV Solar’s McCarthy agrees the current state of affairs where sole traders can earn way more churning out installations than working within high quality companies is a sad one, he is somewhat more optimistic about solutions.
He said RACV has spent a long time dwelling on the staff issue – which, like Mason, he sees not as a new problem but a longstanding dilemma. “We identified the problem early,” he said, and devised a set of strategies to develop a “sticky” staff culture. One that goes beyond simply paying a 20% salary premium – a solution which McCarthy thinks does little more than create a false economy.

Outside of expanding its workforce through corporate acquisitions, RACV Solar has invested heavily in programs for staff. One of those programs is for mental health first aid training, enabling willing staff members to become accredited providers. This, he said, demonstrated to staff that the company cared about them as people rather than “workhorses” and has helped instil a sense of pride.
The company has also invested in a skin checking program, noting that installers are particularly at risk of skin cancer since they spend their days outside. Finally, RACV Solar has a program to identify future leaders among its ‘blue collar’ workforce. That is, it nominates internally for leadership, giving staff a clear pathway up the ranks.
“You’ve got to be really careful to nourish the people in the business and not just the numbers,” McCarthy said. The company, he added, has spent a lot of time sitting down with staff, doing skills maps and listening to where they want their careers to progress. “You need to show people that if you stay here for ten years, this is the roadmap.”
He also noted, however, that these measures to win staff loyalty aren’t cheap and the business has had to absorb the cost of taking workers off the tools. Enacting these measures has been easier for a company like RACV Solar due to its scale. (For reference, the company has 78 in-house staff currently).
McCarthy said RACV would be “happy to help” smaller solar companies to enact professional development programs to help them retain staff, which he agrees is paramount to building quality within the solar industry.
The measures RACV have enacted have been paying off too – with McCarthy saying the company has lost just one of its workers in the last 18 months.

Coming back to Solar Cutters, an industry group premised on developing a culture of quality solar, the group recently launched its formal membership program. It is seeking to formalise its community to better position it to tackle some of these pervasive and growing quality issues.
The group’s co-founder Kosta Bourandanis said it intends to run more training and events within the industry, as well as further educate consumers, raising awareness that cheaper usually does not mean better. 
Moreover, Bourandanis says he wants to see the solar industry sell systems more ethically – something which has also been at the fore for Mason, who only sends out actual electricians to sell systems, saying the company needs to be represented by people who understand the ins and outs of what they are selling.
Employing aggressive marketing tactics, professional salespeople, and rock bottom pricing might get more systems on roofs in the short term, but these practices ultimately harm the industry longterm and decay consumer confidence, all three of the industry insiders agreed.

With his investment firm Grok Ventures now AGL’s largest single shareholder, Cannon-Brookes is seeking to block the company demerger at the upcoming shareholder meeting on June 15.
The demerger is cornerstone of AGL’s new corporate strategy, so stopping it could seriously disrupt Australia’s largest “gentailer” and presumably put Cannon-Brookes’ vision of a complete takeover for the purposed of decarbonisation once again on the table. 
Grok Ventures has now launched a website Keep it together Australia to “actively encourage” AGL shareholders to also block the demerger which it says will threaten the company’s transition, noting AGL’s emissions alone are more than those from Sweden, New Zealand or Portugal.

Given Cannon-Brookes now owns almost half of the 25% stake needed to derail the demerger, it appears the play is well within the realms of possibility. 
It is made all the more feasible given in September last year, 55% of AGL shareholders voted for the company to adopt Paris-aligned climate targets in what was reportedly the largest ever contested resolution in Australian corporate history.
AGL has been slow to transition and its stock price has reflected the growing disquiet, having lost 73% of its value over the past five years. No institutional investors held more than a 4% stake in AGL until yesterday.
In February, Mike Cannon-Brookes and then partner Brookfield Asset Management, a Canadian investment giant, put in a bid to takeover AGL. Their stated plan was to take control of the 185-year-old company, close its substantial coal fleet and replace it with billions of dollars worth of renewables by 2030. 

Cannon-Brookes claimed it would be the world’s largest single decarbonisation project – a staggering call, but one backed up by Tim Buckley, director of  Climate Energy Finance, who previously told pv magazine the play would cumulatively avoid 289 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.
AGL promptly rejected the takeover bid, as well as a subsequent bid made by the duo in March. Following the rejection, Cannon-Brookes and Brookfield announced it would be “pens down” – though both alluded to continued interest.
This brings us back to today’s news of Cannon-Brookes’ campaign to foil the AGL demerger, which he has repeatedly labelled as “value destructive.”
On the new website, Grok Ventures spells out the three primary reasons why the demerger is a bad strategy. The first is that it will destroy shareholder value, primarily because AGL would no longer hold unified control of the generation and distribution assets, making decarbonisation trickier. 

Secondly, Grok Ventures said Accel Energy, the proposed name for the future ‘demerged’ coal carry asset, will not be a viable, standalone public company. This view is widely shared among analysts pv magazine Australia has spoken to, with Buckley likening the plan to cutting the Titanic in half in the hopes one side would float. Moreover, it is believed the company would struggle to pay for the remediation of its polluted sites, as the tide of finance has rapidly turned against fossil companies.
Finally, the letter says the demerger would be “globally irresponsible” as it will “entrench a position that is inconsistent with limiting climate change.”
AGL is Australia’s largest polluter, and generates around 20% of the electricity traded in Australia’s National Electricity Market, primarily from coal. The company also supplies almost one-third of the country’s households – the main reason, it has been suggested, Cannon-Brookes is so eager to takeover the company.
The news comes just hours after AGL announced a failure at one of the units at its Loy Yang A coal power station in Victoria could cost it around $73 million. The failure has led the company to downgrade its profit expectations, with the unit potentially remaining offline for months.
“Sweating old coal plants which are expensive to run, and increasingly breakdown like we’re seeing today with Loy Yang A is not economical or responsible. It makes no sense…or cents,” Cannon-Brookes said in a statement.
AGL is also currently in the process of shutting down one of its other major coal stations, Liddell in New South Wales, in line with a plan made some years ago by the company’s dramatically ousted boss Andy Vesey.

This news will no doubt generate much attention in the fortnight before Australians head to the polls in the culmination of an election campaign where energy and climate policy were among the hottest issues. 
This political turmoil comes on the backdrop of massive electricity cost increases in the eastern states which have seen wholesale prices in the NEM increased 141% in the past year – and 67% in the last three months. While the price hikes are largely to do with the deterioration of coal, it has reflected badly on the renewable energy sector with mass media often pointing to the energy transition as the price spike culprit.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/03/us-startup-claims-hydrogen-output-for-1-2-kg-or-less-via-new-water-vapour-electrolyser/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"MAY 3, 2022",US startup claims hydrogen output for $1.2/kg or less via new water vapour electrolyser,"From pv magazine Global
Milwaukee-based Advanced Ionics has launched a new water vapour electrolyser that is designed to operate in conjunction with commonly available waste or process heat from industry. The Symbiotic Electrolyses system runs at temperatures below 650 C, and is reportedly able to produce hydrogen for US$0.85/kg (AU$1.2/kg) or less.
“This electrolyser is the first to work across a wide range of temperatures, from 100 C to 650 C,” Chad Mason told pv magazine. “Our Symbiotic technology is a new class of electrolyser. It is not alkaline, PEM, or Solide Oxide (SOEC).”
Alkaline, anion exchange membrane (AEM), and polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) are cold electrolysers using liquid water. Solid oxide electrolysers are hot electrolysers working with heated steam, corresponding to higher efficiency. As said, the company’s electrolyser operates with temperatures in between. The idea is that temperatures in between allow for high efficiency, while also using cheaper materials for the large-scale assembly, including the stack.
The industry is currently trying to step away from platinum. Just last week, two different research teams (the first led by Imperial College London, the second by Clemson Nanomaterials Institute) presented ways to substitute the metal.
Russia is currently the second-largest platinum producer in the world, accounting for more than 15% of world production. Similarly, Advanced Ionics does not use platinum and iridium metals.
“We use common materials more regularly found in an alkaline electrolyser, but in a unique configuration,” Mason said. 
The technology uses engineered porous metal electrodes and composite ionic materials for its electrolyte. It does not require “delicate” perfluorinated membranes or “expensive” ceramics, said Mason. Advanced Ionics did not provide any additional details about the membrane. 
Andras Perl, a scientist at EnTranCe Centre of Expertise Energy at the Hanze University of Applied Sciences, explained that the charge carrier in the membrane would be a pivotal element in understanding the future of this technology. 
“Our electrolyser works in tandem with process and waste heat already being produced at industrial sites. By tapping into this existing energy source, we are able to dramatically reduce the electricity requirements for electrolysis, which is the dominant factor in the cost of green hydrogen production. Other electrolysers require a minimum of 40 kWh per kilogram of hydrogen, and usually closer to 50 kWh. We can produce hydrogen for below 35 kWh, and that results in a dramatically lower cost,” Mason said, noting that this assumes that economies of scale have been achieved.
Economies of scale are now key for competing technologies. The timing of funding is also essential. Last week, Advanced Ionics announced the closure of US$4.2 million (AU$5.9 million) of initial financing, led by Clean Energy Ventures. 
“Leveraging this new funding, Advanced Ionics will be developing a series of demonstration projects during the next year with partners before expanding to deploy larger-scale projects. In the near future, they will also build a large-scale electrolyser manufacturing facility to serve key markets such as Europe and North America,” Mason said. 
The company is currently in negotiation with private pilot deployment partners. It expects to take commercial orders in 2024 and ship in 2025. 
“We are being very aggressive on our timelines to match the desperate need for green hydrogen supply to decarbonise all aspects of our economy,” a spokesperson told pv magazine.
Clean Energy Ventures said it is optimistic about the technology.
“After more than five years of evaluating the sector, we backed Advanced Ionics because we believe this leadership team can scale a highly competitive technology to produce the lowest-cost green hydrogen at a scale,” said Daniel Goldman, co-founder and managing partner of Clean Energy Ventures.
According to IHS Markit, the levelised cost of green hydrogen produced through electrolysis was around US$4/kg  to US$5/kg in 2021 (between AU$5.6 – $7). Advanced Ionics claims to be able to provide clean hydrogen without the green premium, for less than US$1/kg ($1.4/kg) using Symbiotic steam electrolysis in many industrial locations. 
“The levelised cost of the hydrogen will depend roughly on the cost of heat, electricity, and the capital cost of the setup. If they get cheap heat, almost free electricity, and no expensive materials, then it seems feasible,” said Perl.
He noted that the results of their first demonstration projects would test the feasibility of the technology at a larger scale and in industrial environments.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/03/shell-to-acquire-indian-solar-developer-for-2-2-billion/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"MAY 3, 2022",Shell to acquire Indian solar developer for $2.2 billion,"From pv magazine India
Shell has announced plans to acquire Indian renewable energy developer Sprng Energy and expects to close the transaction later this year. Group subsidiary Shell Overseas Investment will acquire Sprng Energy from UK investor Actis, which owns Sprng through its Mauritius-based arm, Solenergi Power. 
Shell Overseas Investment has agreed to acquire 100% of Solenergi Power for $1.55 billion and, with it, the Sprng Energy group of companies. 
Established by Actis in 2017, Sprng has more than 2.9 GWp of assets in India (2.1 GWp operating and 0.8 GWp contracted) with a further 7.5 GWp of renewable energy projects in the pipeline. It supplies solar and wind power to electricity distribution companies in India. 
Shell has 1 GW of renewable generation capacity in operation globally. The acquisition of Sprng Energy’ solar and wind assets will triple its present renewable capacity in operation. 
The deal also positions Shell as one of the first movers in building a truly integrated energy transition business in India. In India, its gas business (Shell Energy) serves customers through a fully owned and integrated value chain. It has also invested in companies like Husk Power Systems and Cleantech Solar Pte. Ltd.
Wael Sawan, Shell’s Integrated Gas, Renewables and Energy Solutions Director, believes the acquisition will enable Shell to become a leader across the power value chain in a rapidly growing market where electrification and strong demand for renewables are driving the energy transition.
“Sprng Energy generates cash, has an excellent team, strong and proven development track record and a healthy growth pipeline. Sprng Energy’s strengths can combine with Shell India’s thriving customer-facing gas and downstream businesses to create even more opportunities for growth,” he said.
Sprng Energy will retain its existing brand and operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell within Shell’s Renewables and Energy Solutions Integrated Power business.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/03/elon-musk-wins-solarcity-lawsuit-avoids-2-8-billion-judgment/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,LEGAL,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 3, 2022","Elon Musk wins SolarCity lawsuit, avoids $2.8 billion judgment","From pv magazine USA
Tesla founder Elon Musk will avoid paying more than US$2 billion (AU$2.8 billion) in a shareholder lawsuit related to the acquisition of former top residential installer SolarCity.
“The Tesla board meaningfully vetted the acquisition, and Elon did not stand in its way,” said Delaware court Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights.
The suit alleged that Tesla’s purchase of major installer SolarCity was an attempt to bail out Musk’s cousin’s struggling company, of which Musk was the largest investor and chairman. The shareholders’ suit also accused Tesla’s board of having a lax approach to corporate governance.
Much of this lawsuit revolved around why SolarCity was purchased to begin with. Peter and Lyndon Rive founded SolarCity in 2006 with encouragement from their cousin, Musk. By the time Tesla purchased the company, Musk owned 22.2% and was chair of the board. Although it had grown to become the largest US installer in 2016, earning record revenues of US$730 million, losses were mounting, with US$820 million in net losses that year. The company had accumulated more than US$1.5 billion in debt by the year of the purchase.
SolarCity’s business model relied on marketing, spending heavily on advertising and door-to-door sales, all while offering low-priced, long-term leases. Post-purchase, the strategy changed, as Tesla began to slash marketing costs, moving sales to direct-from-website and in-store sales. Musk noted in a 2019 deposition on the lawsuit that the door-to-door methods and other sales channel strategies did not match Tesla’s brand.
Musk said in the deposition that problems with the Tesla Model 3 caused the company to reassign much of its SolarCity workforce to bolster its vehicle production operations. He could not confirm exactly what portion of the workforce was reassigned. In his testimony, Musk argued that SolarCity could not have raised capital if it had not been acquired by Tesla. There is no doubt that Tesla’s shareholder value has increased impressively since the acquisition.
The development of Tesla’s solar roof program has taken things in a different direction than SolarCity’s model. SolarCity installed panels and equipment from top manufacturers and focused on getting customers signed to long-term leases. Tesla’s solar program now focuses on direct sales and uses proprietary solar tiles in their “solar roof” installations.
“Tesla continued to rely on other solar companies to manufacture, produce, install and sell parts of its solar products. In other words, the synergistic integration that Tesla hoped for is still a work in progress. Despite these challenges, Tesla’s value has massively increased following the Acquisition,” said Slights.
Tesla’s power division is now mostly focused on the home energy storage system, PowerWall. The product accounted for the largest portion of the power division’s US$1.99 billion ($2.8 billion) in revenue last year. Meanwhile, solar installations have fallen behind, with 205 MW installed in 2020, a fraction of the 803 MW SolarCity deployed in 2016. Recently, Tesla fell out of the top three ranking for residential solar installers, being squeezed out by Freedom Forever, a company that posted an impressive 80% installation volume growth in 2021.
Also included in the purchase of SolarCity was a US panel manufacturing plant in Buffalo, New York. Tesla aimed for a 1 GW a year of solar production, but its partner, Panasonic, has since walked away from the project. It is now unclear what volume of panels or roof tiles Tesla currently produces at the facility.
Musk’s victory means he avoided paying more than US$2 billion (AU$2.8 billion) in the shareholder suit – something that may be of relief as he attempts to buy social media platform Twitter for an estimated $44 billion ($62 billion).
