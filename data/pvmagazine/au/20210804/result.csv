Carbontrack launched in Australia in 2015 and has been on a speedy global ascent. Its technology has both hardware and software components which allow users to monitor and control electricity consumption. It can be retrofitted and isn’t limited to smart appliances, homes or brands.
The solution also has an autopilot feature, essentially an algorithm which automates energy use to get the most cost-effective outcome by assessing appliance use and deeming it essential and non-essential.
Carbontrack has been awarded a $877,000 share of the funding, including $428,500 in grant funds, which CEO Brenton Spear said would go towards the continued development of its technology.
Managing Director of the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre, Dr Jens Goennemann, said Australia’s manufacturing industry was ready to get to work. “All 15 co-funded manufacturing projects are expected to generate higher-paying, more resilient jobs onshore, while providing significant export opportunities of high-quality Australian products abroad,” he said.
“These projects also demonstrate the multiplier effect of manufacturing, not just in terms of industry committing significant funds, but also in the fact that for every direct manufacturing role, 3.6 complementary jobs are created elsewhere in the economy.”
Carbontrack’s technology is currently being used by energy companies in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Botswana, Kenya, USA and the UK.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/04/laying-foundations-for-transformation-queensland-startup-answers-network-need-for-grid-digitalisation/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"AUGUST 4, 2021",Laying foundations for transformation: Queensland startup answers need for grid digitalisation,"The truth is electricity grids are exceedingly complicated and only tenuously grasped by most, to put it generously. Digitalising them, which essentially involves collecting live data, collating it and turning it into something comprehensible, then becomes something of a bridge too far, often neglected in conversations about transformation.
But grid digitalisation form the foundation from which clean energy markets can be built. In other words, it’s crucial.
Electricity network operators currently have no visibility over what’s happening on the household to household level of the grid. In the past, they really haven’t needed to. You can easily calculate traffic on a one way street. But today, with one in five Australian homes exporting electricity into the network from their rooftop solar, it’s a staggering oversight.
“The networks across Australia, and also most places across the world, are totally blind. They don’t actually know what’s going on there… they use calculations and professional estimations based on engineering experience,” Luceo Energy’s CEO, Patrick Matweew, told pv magazine Australia.
Endeavour Energy
Network’s lack of visibility on the low-voltage segment of the grid, which connects households and makes up most of the network, has been flagged as one of the country’s most pressing problems by the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC). It has meant that networks often use the blunt tool of limiting solar exports, curtailing the amount of cleanly generated electrons which make it into our grid, mirroring some of the issues which plague large-scale renewable projects in this country.
Digitalisation, data, is a solution to this impasse. And Luceo Energy, a Brisbane-based startup believes it has the platform to make it happen. “Basically what [the Australian Energy Market Operator], the AEMC, all the people that operate the networks, that’s ultimately what they want because then you see all of Australia live and breathing and you see all your households, all your network paths being visible and you can see what’s going on in terms of solar production, you can see what’s going on in terms of safety and so on. So that’s kind of the ultimate goal here – how do we digitise the grid in a full way and basically make it live and visible.”
“Once you get data and visibility, you can do a lot of other things,” Matweew said.
Luceo Energy was actually born at the behest of Energy Queensland, one of the state’s network operators.
It approached Redback Technologies – Luceo’s parent company – to ask for help with its stability woes. Redback, established in 2015, is a solar energy storage company that works heavily with software and platform technology.
Energy Queensland sought the company out really to ask if it could use the data collected by its systems. “It was so good what they saw, because the data comes basically live, they said ‘we would need more of that to help us run our network.’ And that resulted into a project,” Matweew explained.
The partnership saw the two companies develop a large commercial trial, and it didn’t take before Redback realised the platform could become a business unto its own. And so Luceo was established in October 2020, commercially offering its cloud-based platform to give network operators real-time data and analytics to manage fleets of distributed resources like rooftop solar.

In terms of Luceo’s vision, giving network’s visibility is something of a happy byproduct. What it is really striving to create is a platform which collates data and digitalises the grid in such a way that it enables two-way green energy markets to be built.
“You want to create a single point of truth that all transaction parties can relate to and accept as their platform for settlement,” Matweew said.
Opening up these new markets, he says, benefits not only operators, but retailers and consumers, who can then engage and trade in new ways. “Technology is an enabler for such a future market.”
“I think you’ll see a lot of innovation in the next decade around how you can actually make money and provide services in the energy market,” he added.
Matweew is cognisant of how ambitious it is for startup that hasn’t even celebrated its first birthday to set  sights on providing the “single point of truth” for future energy trading. “How can an Australian startup manage that? Well, we partner with one of the biggest providers of data services, Microsoft, and they provide that infrastructure and we provide that front end solution,” he said.
Luceo’s platform is hosted on Microsoft Azure which, Matweew says, gives it access to “huge amounts of computing power” making it “almost indefinitely scalable.”
At the moment, its platform has tens of thousands of data points, but Matweew says it’s designed to take millions, and is capable of doing so now. “We’re not talking about intent, it’s there today.”

Given that data forms the nub of Luceo’s offering, this is sticky point. As it stands, Luceo has developed its own hardware to collect its bounty. A grey container the size of a child’s shoe box is installed next to a household’s switchboard and owned by the network operator. This solution, Matweew admits, is far from ideal.
The company is currently working on a way to make this hardware component less intrusive and more attractive for networks to install – a necessary innovation curve for Luceo.
Preferably though, Luceo would import its data not from its own hardware but rather from smart meters or smart inverters and batteries. The biggest hurdle to clear here is not technology, but regulation.
The platform is already capable of integrating data from these external sources, Matweew said.

Smart meter data today is lumpy, scarce and difficult to access if you’re outside of Victoria. Currently, smart meters’ primary job is to provide information to retailers for the purposes of billing. Outside of Victoria, if networks want to access data collected by smart meters, they need to buy it. Which is costly and by the time they get their hands on it, just a record of the past which is not particularly granular. “If you had a real ‘smart’ smart meters, you wouldn’t need a Luceo device,” Matweew said. For now, you still do.
Smart inverters and batteries also hold promise for collecting data – and can do so with far more granularity, gathering information on a minute by minute basis. Matweew riffs that if the company were able to access data from all the solar inverters in Australia, it would be possible to provide national data, collating information on all the solar systems in Australia from one single source which could then be provided to parties eligible to see it. “That’s basically the vision.”
In the meantime, Luceo has teamed up with another Australian startup, GridQube, the University of Queensland, and networks Essential Energy and Energy Queensland to develop a use-case of its technology. The consortium is developing what’s known as Project SHIELD (Synchronising Heterogeneous Information to Evaluate Limits for DNSPs) and last month secured $2.6 million in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).
The intention is to help networks make data-driven decisions around how much solar they can accomodate on each of their “feeders” (basically a part of the network) a before upgrades need to be made. It’s about giving networks a safe “operating envelope” so they don’t have to constrain customer’s solar exports.
The project, Matweew said, also has safety benefits, allowing the sources of outages to be detected more quickly and accurately, as well as help with voltage management. “Once you have visibility and you have notifications and alerts, your operational efficiency as the operator is significantly improved,” he said.

Luceo’s platform works on a subscription model, paid for by customers month to month based on the services they use. Most customers, Matweew said, pay an amount equivalent to cents per day, though pricing could amount to a couple of dollars daily.
While its main customer-base remains in Queensland, Luceo is in early stage discussions with networks in other states. It is also speaking with companies in the United States and southeast Asia. “We have quite an attractive proposition there,” Matweew said.
He believes that Australia has an opportunity, afforded by its unique position with world-leading rooftop solar penetration, to develop technology that can benefit the global energy transition and provide massive economic opportunities along the way.
“There a humungous transformation happening and Australia is really spearheading that,” Matweew said. “A lot of focus is given to certain aspects of this transformation but the redesigning and re-envisioning of the underlying infrastructure is very often overlooked.”
“If we want to be leading in renewable energy… we have to have agile collaboration between all the different stakeholders, including households.”

Joining South Australia’s Tindo Solar in the Australian made and owned solar manufacturing game, Sydney-based MSquare Energy (MSquare) claims to have ambitions of becoming the largest solar panel manufacturer in Australia with a fully automated facility. 
In what will be news to few, Sydney is currently in strict Covid-19 lockdown, meaning pv magazine Australia is not currently able to visit the MSquare’s facility, located in the western Sydney suburb of Toongabbie. 
However, what we know from an MSquare statement is that it’s currently claiming a 300 MW manufacturing capacity through fully-automatic assembly factory making panels up to 445W, with plans to bring M10 panels up to 590W all black into the line by October 2021. 


MSquare says it has already begun exporting some of its products to the United States, and has purchased a site in Kelso, near Bathurst, for a second manufacturing facility which it says will triple manufacturing capacity. 
According to MSquare, its “business goal is to become the leading solar panel manufacturing company in Australia”, an ambitious goal considering Tindo Solar secured $1 million federal funding in June to help it transition to new M10 cell technology and boost production capacity with a new $6 million state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Adelaide nearing completion.
What can be said for certain is that Australian module manufacturing industry is at a pivotal stage of development, and that MSquare is throwing its hat in the ring. 
Update: MSquare claimed that its panels were CEC approved, but the CEC has told pv magazine Australia that MSquare was delisted in 2020 for “failure to meet the specified power rating in Clean Energy Council testing.” However “all corrective actions required to be completed after their de-listing were addressed, and a new application for listing was processed earlier this year.” This is an evolving story with more pv magazine Australia coverage to come.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/04/powering-australian-renewables-completes-2-7-billion-tilt-renewables-takeover/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW ZEALAND",BLAKE MATICH,"AUGUST 4, 2021",Powering Australian Renewables completes $2.7 billion Tilt Renewables takeover,"Mercury NZ and Powering Australian Renewables Fund (PowAR), a consortium consisting of AGL Energy (20% stake), the Future Fund and Queensland government-owned investment manager QIC (80% stake), took full control of New Zealand’s Tilt Renewables yesterday after an almost $2.7 billion takeover back in March 2021. 
In an announcement to the NZX and ASX, Tilt Renewables confirmed “that its New Zealand incorporated subsidiaries were acquired by Mercury Wind Limited this morning and, following that, 100% of the shares in Tilt Renewables were acquired by Powering Australian Renewables.” 
With the change of ownership, trading on the bourses of Tilt’s shares have officially stopped today, and PowAR has become the largest owner of wind and solar in Australia, not to mention the largest renewable energy generator (after Snowy Hydro), and all on the same day that CEO of PowAR, Geoff Dutallis, told the Australian Financial Review that it was time for the Australian federal government to make a net zero commitment. 
It’s time to “put a target on the hill like everyone else,” he said, “We already have the technology [to decarbonise the grid]”. And after the acquisition of Tilt Renewables, PowAR now plans to expand its pipeline of projects (which now includes the 100 MW Dysart Solar Farm in QLD, and the 80 MW Illabo Solar Farm in NSW), specifically on the east coast section of the National Electricity Market (NEM). 
“In the near term, Liverpool in NSW is very attractive,” Dutallis told AFR, “- the central states of the NEM. The Wadding project in WA is in a different market but we want to enter.” 
Dutallis said there remained a strong need of utility-scale solar and wind projects, as well as storage, to “do the heavy lifting” even despite the world-leading rooftop solar integration. “At the utility scale there’s more than enough to keep us busy. You need reliance of the grid, you can’t solve everything with the metre rooftop solar.” 
QIC’s head of global infrastructure, Ross Israel, also spoke to AFR, saying the demand for tangible assets in an uncertain world was driving the recent spate of takeover bids. Speaking of the assets involved in the Tilt Renewables takeover, Israel said, “Some of the assets in question will be resilient and essential in the nature of a potentially more inflationary environment.”

A traditional gas-powered light-duty car costs about US$1,260 (AU$1700) a year to fuel, an EV lands at about US$1,058 (AU$1430) per year when a public charger is used. With home solar, EV owners can power their car for as little as US$415 (AU$560) annually, according to a new consumer report run by SolarReviews.
Over a 25-year span, a typical warranty period for home solar, SolarReviews estimated that charging an EV with home solar could lead to average savings of US$16,250 (AU$22,000).
The DOE also reports that scheduled maintenance for light-duty vehicles costs at about ten cents per mile, while battery electric vehicles only cost about six cents per mile to maintain.

A battery electric vehicle lacks engine oil, timing belts, oxygen sensors, spark plugs, and many more components and the maintenance costs associated with them. This means, over their lifetime, EV’s cost 40% less in scheduled maintenance costs than traditional gas-powered vehicles.
SolarReviews compared a gas-powered Hyundai Kona, and an all-electric Hyundai Kona, and found that in a 13,500-mile year, the gas-powered Kona would spend US$1,260 (AU$1700) on gas, while the EV charged at home would spend US$662 (AU$900) per year in California, and as little as US$450 (AU$600) per year in a state like Florida.
Plus, home solar energy is cheaper and greener than pulling your EV’s power from the grid. Grid-sourced energy can range from US$.10 to US$.40 per kWh, and averages about US$.13 per kWh, while the levelised cost of energy for home solar across the country landed at US$.11 per kWh, according to SolarReviews. Both of these options are significantly cheaper than a public charger, which ranges from US$.28 to US$.69 per kWh.
From a carbon standpoint, home solar performs the best as well, reported SolarReviews. Home solar has an implied emission of 368 lbs (167 kg) of carbon dioxide per 3,780 kWh, while grid power and EV chargers stand at 1,531 lbs (695kg) , and 450 gallons of gasoline (an equivalent to 3,780 kWh) would emit a whopping 8,830 lbs (4,005 kg) of CO2.
Curiosity for EVs and their integration with home solar is on the rise, as SolarReviews reported a 1000% year over year increase in requests to estimate the solar requirements of charging a Tesla on their website. They suggest that an average of five additional solar panels would be sufficient for the average driver to meet the needs of a Tesla Model 3 charged on a level 2 charger.
“Home solar is the key to unlocking the most value from an EV investment, representing the cheapest charging method with the lowest carbon footprint when compared to public EV chargers, grid power and gasoline,” said Andy Sendy, Founder and President of SolarReviews. “Home solar is the clear solution for consumers looking to get the most out of their electric vehicles and realise consistent and sustainable cost savings.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/04/solar-powered-large-scale-microbial-food-production/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 4, 2021",Solar-powered large scale microbial food production,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists at the Göttingen University in Germany have proposed to combine solar power generation with the production of microbial proteins, which they believe may be an alternative to plant and animal proteins and ensure food security while reducing land consumption. 
The production of microbial proteins, which consist of a powder that can be used as protein-rich feed for animals or as food for people, can be done by bacteria, fungi, yeast, and algae and is considered an alternative to growing conventional crops. The scientists note that a quantitative comparison between traditional agriculture and photovoltaic-driven microbial protein systems, in terms of land use and energetic efficiency, had not yet been made.
“We show that the production of microbial foods outperforms agricultural cultivation of staple crops in terms of caloric and protein yields per land area at all relevant solar irradiance levels,” the academics stated in the paper Photovoltaic-driven microbial protein production can use land and sunlight more efficiently than conventional crops, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS).
The German group modelled the large-scale production of microbial biomass, which is also known as single-cell protein (SCP), by combining ground-mounted photovoltaics, air, water, and nutrients to grow the microbial proteins. Under this configuration, PV is used to convert atmospheric CO2 derived from direct air capture into microbial biomass.
First, the electricity generated by the solar plant is used to produce chemical energy that is stored in electron donors such as hydrogen, methanol, and formate. This is then converted into chemical energy stored in biomass by microbial growth. In the final filtration step of the process, nucleotides, fatty acids, and carbohydrates are discarded from the biomass and only the protein is retained.
According to the researcher’s findings, the solar-powered production of SCPs requires only 10% of the land area compared to soybean, which is the most efficient plant crop. In addition, the report notes plants and animals use approximately 100 and 10,000 times more water to generate equivalent calories, respectively.
“The study calculated that even in northern climates with less sunshine, the yields of solar-powered microbial foods could far outproduce staple crops, while minimising water and fertiliser use,” the academics emphasised. “Importantly, this production could also be located in regions not suitable for agriculture, such as deserts.”
They also acknowledged, however, that SCPs may have to deal with a difficult consumer acceptance in the food market or pressure on prices in the feed market.
