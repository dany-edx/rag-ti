So how do we make demand more flexible?,"New South Wales (NSW) has other new policies to “get the energy transition back on track”. These include expanding “customer energy resources”, such as solar panels and batteries, and increasing “demand flexibility” (broadly, using smart technology to shift the times when businesses and homes use power).
With more variable supply from solar and wind energy, demand flexibility is a cheaper and cleaner way to keep the electricity grid stable.
Modelling for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) shows this approach could save consumers up to A$18 billion to 2040. Shifting demand can avoid:

Examples of flexible demand include:
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) estimates NSW needs an extra 191 megawatts (MW) of capacity to maintain reliability when Eraring closes.
Another way to cover that capacity shortfall is more flexible demand. Queensland already has almost 150 MW of remote-controlled air conditioning. Other types of demand management that Queensland grid operators can call on total about 900MW.
In Western Australia, a newly signed contract will provide 120 MW of demand flexibility.

ARENA commissioned the Institute for Sustainable Futures to review the pilot demand flexibility projects it has funded. Many didn’t deliver as much as hoped.
Sometimes, this was because businesses were too busy with day-to-day operations or payments for households were too low to catch their interest. But often it’s a matter of putting policies, technical standards and regulations in place to make demand management seamless and efficient.
ARENA has spent about $180 million on 55 projects with at least some focus on flexible demand. They include air conditioning, pool pumps and hot water systems in homes, commercial building air conditioning and electric vehicle charging.
ARENA is looking at innovative ways to maintain system security and reliability. Flexible demand is a solution that can make greater use of variable renewable energy, while supporting Australia’s power system.

What do these projects tell us about how to increase demand flexibility?
1. Better technical standards
The technical standards required of manufacturers often don’t ensure devices can be used to shape demand. Many air-conditioners couldn’t be controlled in ARENA pilots.
There is also no technical standard for “inter-operability” of devices within homes. Batteries, hot water systems and other devices with different companies’ technologies don’t always work well together.
Vehicle-to-grid charging for electric vehicles will be the largest opportunity for demand flexibility, but there is no common technical standard. It’s vital to have one before the mass uptake of electric vehicles.
Outside Victoria, smart meters that provide real-time information on home energy use are rare. The Australian Energy Market Commission has recommended governments accelerate roll-out of smart meters to 100% by 2030.

2. Simpler measurement systems
The measurement systems to calculate payments for demand flexibility are a barrier to expansion. It’s tricky as you need to measure how much electricity was used relative to what would otherwise have occurred.
ARENA pilots that tried to precisely measure residential demand flexibility found it was financially unviable at the smaller scale.
The system used for AEMO’s Wholesale Demand Response Mechanism (WDRM) effectively limits participation to businesses with predictable, flat consumption profiles. This excludes as much as 80–90% of sites. International measurement models could be trialed here to open up participation.
3. More certainty about payments
Earnings from providing demand flexibility depend on weather, market prices and so on. This uncertainty makes it hard to get businesses to sign up.
Overseas, some energy markets guarantee payment for making demand flexibility available. These have the highest participation.
The federal government is consulting on a capacity investment scheme. Because it will have the same measurement system as the current mechanism, participation is likely to be limited.
4. Fresh policy approaches
Businesses that sign up under the Wholesale Demand Response Mechanism make bids in the National Electricity Market to be paid for reducing their power use when demand and prices are high. This should reduce prices for all consumers and improve energy security when the grid is under stress. However, it has attracted only one participant – mainly due to the complex measurement system – and isn’t open to households.
Another incentive scheme for electricity networks to invest in demand management is chronically under-used.
There are simpler alternatives that have worked before. The national Renewable Energy Target and state energy efficiency certificate schemes fund rooftop solar or energy retrofits based on average output or energy savings from past experience. These simple calculations offer a relatively stable incentive, which could work for demand flexibility.
NSW’s Peak Demand Reduction Scheme, launched last year, could provide a model for using certificate schemes to boost demand flexibility.

The focus of NSW’s development of a customer energy resources policy appears to be on “virtual power plants”. These co-ordinate household solar and battery systems to store solar power and export to the grid when it’s most needed.
Batteries are part of the solution, but cheaper options exist. An electric water heater with a 300-litre tank can store as much energy as a second-generation Tesla battery at much less cost.
Modelling for ARENA finds hot water systems could store as much energy as more than 2 million household batteries. Retrofitting these systems will spread savings more widely to include low-income households as well as those that can afford a battery.
It’s time we got serious about developing a holistic demand flexibility strategy. It will be cheaper and cleaner than paying coal plants to stay open.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/13/engie-partners-with-posco-for-pilbara-green-hydrogen-study/,"HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 13, 2023",Engie partners with Posco for Pilbara green hydrogen study,"Posco and Engie have announced they will conduct a pre-feasibility study for a major renewable hydrogen project, including utility scale wind and solar generation, to be developed near Port Hedland in Western Australia’s Pilbara.
The two parties said the study will determine the feasibility of using renewable hydrogen to fuel Posco’s proposed hot briquetted iron plant that would provide feedstock for the company’s South Korean steel-making operations.
While no details about the capacity of the green hydrogen project were made public, the state government said the study will support development plans for inland renewable energy sites, including wind and solar generation, a hydrogen electrolyser, large-scale storage capability and a pipeline capable of transporting green hydrogen to South Korea to decarbonise Posco’s assets.
The study is expected to be completed in early 2024.
The proposed project is the second large-scale green hydrogen venture Engie is pursuing in the Pilbara, having commenced construction of a facility that will provide feedstock into Yara Pilbara Fertilisers’ existing ammonia operations near Karratha.
The Yuri project will include a 10 MW electrolyser and 18 MW of solar coupled with an 8 MW/5 MWh lithium-ion battery energy storage system for firming. The project is scheduled for completion in 2024.
The new project is a continuation of Engie’s alliance with Posco which began with the signing of a memorandum of understanding in 2022, when the two companies agreed to explore joint development opportunities for green hydrogen production and related infrastructure in Australia, the Middle East and Latin America.
The agreement feeds into Engie’s aim of generating 80 GW of renewable capacity and 4 GW of electrolyser capacity by 2030, and Posco’s ambition for a green hydrogen-based steel business by 2050.
Posco senior Executive Vice President Byeong-Og Yoo said at the time that steel manufacturing is undergoing significant transformation as governments and businesses increasingly embrace the shift toward carbon neutrality.
“At Posco, we intend to establish a hydrogen production capacity of seven million tonnes by 2050 to become a top 10 producer globally in support of the transition to green steel making,” he said.
The first of the projects being pursued under the agreement was announced earlier this year with Engie and Posco heading a consortium that will develop a green hydrogen and green ammonia project in Oman.
The project will include up to approximately 5 GW of new wind and solar capacity, battery energy storage and a renewable hydrogen plant with a capacity of up to 200 ktpa. The hydrogen will be used to produce about 1.2 million tonnes of green ammonia per year that will be exported to South Korea.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/13/bouldercombe-blaze-sparks-safety-message-for-manufacturers/,"ENERGY STORAGE,QUALITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 13, 2023",Wärtsilä urges industry to improve in wake of Bouldercombe battery fire,"Amid concerns about lithium-ion battery fires, similar to the blaze that broke out at Genex Power’s Bouldercombe battery project in central Queensland last month, Finnish technology group Wärtsilä said safety needs to be the top priority for manufacturers as the global rollout of utility scale battery energy storage gathers pace.
Andrew Tang, vice-president of energy storage at Wärtsilä, said the risk of lithium-ion batteries catching fire cannot be entirely eliminated but there are measures that can, and are, being taken which reduce that risk.
While fires in large-scale batteries are rare, Tang said it is incumbent upon the energy storage industry to invest in fire safety testing and adhere to the industry’s most stringent safety standards,
“Fire safety should be the first priority for everyone involved in the energy storage industry right now,” he said. “Manufacturers must ensure that technological innovations are not being introduced at the expense of safety.”
The fire that erupted at the 50 MW/100 MWh Bouldercombe battery project near Rockhampton in Queensland last month underscores the risks inherent in large-scale storage.
The blaze broke out in one of the 40 Tesla Megapack battery modules at the Bouldecombe site. Genex said the damage had been contained to a single unit with the project back online just 48 hours after shutting down.
The battery had been operating at or near full capacity in the days leading up to the fire as Genex worked through the final phases of its commissioning process. Genex said it is now working with Tesla to investigate the root cause of the fire.
The Bouldercombe incident is the second major fire at a large-scale battery project in Australia. In 2021, Neoen’s 300 MW/450 MWh Victorian Big Battery in Geelong caught fire only days after it began operations, with two Tesla Megapacks damaged. It was later found the fire, which burned for three days, was “most likely” caused by a cooling system leak that short-circuited a Megapack.

Wärtsilä Product Manager Chris Groves said the investigation conducted by Energy Safe Victoria in the wake of that fire had provided “some valuable lessons” for the industry.
“Fire in the energy storage industry is a complex challenge,” he said, noting that there’s no one reason why fires occur.
“One issue the industry has encountered is foreign materials, like condensation or dust, entering the outer shell of the battery system or even the battery modules themselves if they are not sealed properly. This can trigger fires through short circuits or surges,” he said.
“Another major risk associated with lithium-ion batteries is thermal runaway, which is an uncontrollable chain reaction within the battery that can start from a short circuit, manufacturing defect, external heat, overcharging or physical damage.”
Groves said to avoid fires, manufacturers must focus on their hardware, invest in software and improve testing practices.
The industry’s model fire codes (IFC and NFPA 855) require that testing is done as per the test method UL 9540A, but Groves said manufacturers need to be completing large-scale testing that is designed to simulate how the system would react in the worst-case fire scenario.
“From a hardware perspective, manufacturers should design and implement high IP-rated enclosures and modules to create a strong barrier that seals crucial components away from the elements,” he said.
“This has to be paired with proven cooling systems to control the internal temperature of the battery system and surge protection systems that can withstand irregularities and prevent damage to the battery cells.”
Groves said hardware is just one part of an integrated strategy to mitigate fire risk with “advanced software that can monitor for potential risks, alert staff to issues and implement automatic responses is equally important.”

Wärtsilä has been selected to provide the batteries for some of Australia’s largest energy storage projects, and is currently in negotiations to supply the recently approved Melbourne Renewable Energy Hub project being developed on the outskirts of the Victorian capital by Singapore-headquartered Equis. It is expected the 1.2 GW/2.4 GWh battery energy storage system will utilise lithium iron phosphate technology.
Wärtsilä also provided the batteries for AGL’s 260 MW/260 MWh Torrens Island battery storage project in South Australia has been chosen by Origin Energy to deliver the first 460 MW/920 MWh stage of the Eraring battery being developed in New South Wales.
Tang said the company has a 100% safety track record for its GridSolv Quantum energy storage systems.
“That’s the priority at Wärtsilä,” he said. “We don’t sacrifice safety as a top priority.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/13/king-honours-australian-solar-pioneers/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 13, 2023",King honours Australian solar pioneers,"Australian scientists Martin Green and Andrew Blakers, alongside former University of New South Wales (UNSW) alumni Jianhua Zhao and Aihua Wang have been awarded the 2023 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering for the invention and development of Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell (PERC) solar technology, which has underpinned the global growth in high-performance, low-cost solar electricity.
The quartet were announced as winners of the QEPRize earlier this year and presented with their awards by King Charles III in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace overnight (AEST).
The four were part of a team at the UNSW that developed PERC technology, improving the quality of both the top and the rear surface of standard silicon solar cells. Their work helped increase the conversion efficiency of standard solar cells by more than 50% in relative terms from 16.5% in the early 1980s to 25% in the early 2000s.
The team’s innovations and advances in solar technology are considered instrumental in the global transition to renewable energy, helping reduce the cost of solar panels by 80% in the last decade with solar now the lowest cost option for bulk electricity supply.
Green, who led the UNSW team, said he was proud of the major impact the achievements of many of his former students, including his fellow awardees, have had on the world.
“As engineers, we are constantly striving to improve the world we live in,” he said. “As the world feels the devastating impacts of our changing environment and collapsing ecosystems, I feel passionately that we must rapidly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels if we wish to maintain the trajectory of human civilisation on our shared planet.
“I hope that PERC technology winning the QEPrize will highlight the importance of accelerated solar adoption to address climate change.”

Wang, who along with her husband Zhao spent almost two decades working on PERC cells at UNSW before they returned to China, said she was grateful their work has played such a critical role in achieving energy efficiency targets.
“Achievements in engineering can have a remarkable impact all over the world,” she said.
Green’s lab at the UNSW held the global record for solar cell efficiency for 30 of the 40 years from 1983 to 2023. The awardees opted not to patent their pioneering work, freeing PERC technology to be widely adopted.
PERC technology is now the most commercially viable silicon solar cell technology for use in solar panels, accounting for almost 90% of the global solar cell market.

The $14.2 billion (USD 8.96 billion) project is expected to provide 2 GW of dispatchable generating capacity and approximately 48,000 MWh of large-scale storage to the National Electricity Market.
Queensland Hydro also said the state’s Coordinator-General has declared the project, being developed at the 46,000 megalitre Borumba Dam near Gympie, a coordinated project, enabling an assessment of social, economic and environmental matters to begin.
The project involves building a new dam wall at Lake Borumba that will increase the dam’s storage capacity to 224,000 megalitres. A new dam will also be created at a higher altitude with the two reservoirs connected by an underground power station. Water will be pumped to the upper dam during periods of surplus renewable energy and low demand, and then released back to generate electricity during times of high demand.
Pending successful planning and environmental approvals, the project is targeting first power in 2030.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the project, the first of two large-scale long-duration energy storage projects planned by the Queensland government, will play a key role in the state’s renewable energy transition.
“Pumped hydro is proven technology, ready to go now,” he said. “Borumba will allow us to replace expensive fossil fuels with Queensland’s sun, wind, and water, putting the Sunshine State on the map as a global renewable energy hub.”
The Queensland government is aiming to have 70% renewable energy by 2032 and 80% by 2035, up from about 25% of total power generation at present.
De Brenni said the Borumba project will be subject to Queensland procurement policy with the state government looking for Sunshine Coast companies and tradespeople to be part of the build. At peak construction, the project is expected to deliver an estimated 2,300 jobs.

The Dutch team is driving a so-called Challenger Class vehicle, which limits the solar PV plate to four m2 size, according to the race’s regulations limits. “There are about 400 tandem cells in the entire solar deck array,” Stewart Hooper, manager of Product Realisation and Advanced Products, Oxford PV, told pv magazine.
“The tandem cells are a custom size, cut from our regular M6 size production cells,” said Hopper, adding that the standard Oxford PV cells were cut down to 100 cm2 for the vehicle’s solar plate. In addition, to keep the weight in check the solar deck array is not enclosed in glass.
This is the first time that Oxford PV is participating in the competition. It has been making efficiency progress in recent months with heterojunction-perovskite tandem cells made at its production facility in Brandenburg, Germany.
“Over the past year our team has been studying how to capture the sun’s energy as best as possible using new, innovative technologies that will allow us to compete against teams with over 10 years of experience. Tandem silicon solar cells from Oxford PV can outperform traditional silicon solar cells by at least 20% and represent the next big leap forward for solar power, as silicon cells approach their theoretical limits,” said Laura de la Fuente Esteban, PV Engineer at Top Dutch Solar Racing.
The Bridgeston World Solar Challenge will be on 20-27 October 2023. There are 32 entries in the Challenger Class from 18 locations around the world. Competitors participate from schools and universities around the world. In the The competition was last held in 2019. The 2021 event was cancelled due to the travel restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic.
