The research team, led by Dr Rhys Grinter, PhD student Ashleigh Kropp, and Professor Chris Greening from the Monash University Biomedicine Discovery Institute in Melbourne, isolated and analysed the genetic code of an enzyme that enables a common soil bacteria to consume hydrogen and extract energy from it.
Their findings, published in the Nature journal, reveals that this “hydrogenase” enzyme, or Huc, uses the low amounts of the hydrogen in the atmosphere to create an electrical current.
“We’ve known for some time that bacteria can use the trace hydrogen in the air as a source of energy to help them grow and survive,” Greening said. “But we didn’t know how they did this, until now.”

A hydrogen molecule comprises two positively charged protons held together by a bond formed by two negatively charged electrons. The research team said Huc breaks this bond, the protons part ways, and the electrons are released. In the bacteria, these free electrons then flow into a complex circuit called the “electron transport chain” and are harnessed to provide the cell with energy.
Grinter said Huc is extraordinarily efficient, able to convert even minute concentrations of hydrogen directly into electricity, which can power an electrical circuit.
“Unlike all other known enzymes and chemical catalysts, it even consumes hydrogen below atmospheric levels – as little as 0.00005% of the air we breathe,” he said.
Laboratory work also shows that Huc is very stable, able to withstand temperatures from 80℃ down to -80℃ without activity loss. The research team also said the bacteria that produce enzymes like Huc are common and can be grown in large quantities, ensuring access to a sustainable source of the enzyme.
The scientists acknowledged that it is early days for the research and said several technical challenges will need to be overcome to realise the potential of Huc as a power source.
“For one thing, we will need to significantly increase the scale of Huc production,” they said. “In the lab we produce Huc in milligram quantities, but we want to scale this up to grams and ultimately kilograms.”
“Once we produce Huc in sufficient quantities, the sky is quite literally the limit for using it to produce clean energy,” Grinter said.

“We are building our first utility-scale battery in South Australia, the state where it all began for Zen,” Zen Energy Chief Executive Officer Anthony Garnaut said.
Zen said the project, being developed near Gawler about 60 kilometres north of Adelaide, has already received approval to connect to the grid, and praised RES for having run an efficient Generation Performance Standards (GPS) approval process in partnership with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and SA transmission company ElectraNet.
“The team at RES did a fantastic job in guiding the project through the last round of approvals that a project like this requires, and our team have been able to hit the ground running,” Garnaut said.
The Templers Battery Project is expected to reach financial close in the coming months with construction planned to commence shortly after. Zen expects the project to take no more than 15 months to complete and is expecting the battery, which will utilise lithium-ion battery cells, to be fully energised and providing services to the grid before the end of 2024.
Once completed, Zen plans to use the battery to support the delivery of energy to its existing SA-based customers, with the battery also expected to perform grid-stability services to the wider National Electricity Market (NEM), paving the way for more renewable energy generation.
Garnaut said the move to add battery energy storage to Zen’s baseload renewables portfolio is consistent with AEMO’s 2022 Electricity Statement of Opportunities update released in February 2023. In that, the market operator said “urgent” investment in long-duration energy storage, generation and transmission is needed to avoid power supply becoming unreliable later this decade as coal power plants close.
”Storage plays a critical role in allowing more renewable energy into the grid,” Garnaut said. “When it is commissioned in late 2024, the Templers battery will have the most storage capacity of the batteries in South Australia, and it will quickly be followed by bigger batteries supported by ZEN and others.”
“At the rate we’re going, South Australia will be 100% well before 2030, enabling the revitalisation of core industries and for Australia to evolve into a renewable energy superpower.”
The Templers Battery Project is just one of the renewable energy assets Zen is developing as it looks to grow its generation portfolio to supply customers through long-term, fixed price retail contracts.
The company, which has offtake agreements in place with 20 solar and wind farms, including the 132 MW Nevertire, the 56 MW Moree and the 120 MW Hillston solar farm in New South Wales, is also pursuing plans to develop a large-scale hybrid solar and battery project between Burra and Morgan in SA’s mid-north.
Zen said the Solar River project will be nominally 230 MWdc and the battery will be at least 100 MW with three hours of capacity. The project will connect to the ElectraNet network via a new 275 kV switchyard located outside of Robertstown.
Zen said the project has been issued a development approval and the company is now working through the final stages of a grid connection application process. Construction is expected to commence later this year and renewable energy from this project will be delivered to the NEM in 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/10/province-looks-at-port-development-to-support-8-gw-green-hydrogen-project/,"HYDROGEN,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 10, 2023",Province looks at port development to support 8 GW green hydrogen project,"Perth-based Province Resources has appointed geotechnical engineering firm Marine & Earth Sciences to undertake a marine geophysical survey to inform a feasibility study into establishing a port north of Carnarvon after taking back full ownership of the HyEnergy hydrogen project.
The proposed port would be located about 20 kilometres north of Carnarvon on the Western Australian (WA) coast, near the proposed production facilities for the HyEnergy green hydrogen project.
Conceptual plans for the port include a loading jetty, cyclone haven for tugs and a materials offloading facility. Landside facilities would include production operations, light industrial areas and opportunities for third party users.
Province Resources Managing Director David Frances said the company had engaged a number a consultants with expertise in port developments to progress plans for the facility.
“Our discussions with government and the local community have indicated strong support for a port in this area,” he said. “While the port would primarily service the HyEnergy project, it is clear there are a number of additional stakeholders that would benefit from such a facility.”
The launch of the marine study comes after Province confirmed that a term sheet inked with the Australian arm of French developer Total Eren on the development of the HyEnergy project had expired without the companies signing a binding term sheet.

The companies completed a scoping study for the project and finalised key terms for a co-development agreement in August 2022, but Province said the two firms were now “not fully aligned on the objectives of the project” and it will continue to take the project forward alone.
“The company is fully funded to undertake pre-feasibility studies and definitive feasibility studies,” it said in a statement. “It will also continue to advance its land tenure position.”
The proposed HyEnergy project comprises a total of up to 8 GW of co-located solar and wind energy which would be used to produce green hydrogen for domestic use and export. The project is to be developed in two stages. Phase one of the project would comprise up to 5 GW of wind and solar capacity with the generated electricity used to produce approximately 300,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year. Province said phase two would expand to meet market demand as the hydrogen economy grows.
While Province is now exploring the possible construction of a new port to facilitate export of the green hydrogen, the offtake solution for the HyEnergy project is yet to be finalised. Province said it is continuing to work with WA renewables company Provaris Energy on a compressed hydrogen concept.
Engineering services firm GHD has been appointed to undertake a prefeasibility study for the downstream component of the HyEnergy project.
The scope of the study includes energy storage systems, water production, electrolysis, ammonia synthesis and product storage, loading and export. It will also cover construction phase support facilities, including an accommodation camp, and marine import facilities, including a materials offloading facility.
The downstream PFS is expected to be completed in the third quarter of this year, while a tender is expected to be awarded soon for a similar study on the upstream components.
“We are now well-placed to significantly increase the pace of this development,” Frances said.

TrendForce said it expects prices of polysilicon, solar cells, and modules to drop slightly on the month in February, when Chinese manufacturers unexpectedly raised prices across the entire supply chain.
“Polysilicon prices began to plummet in December last year, so the major polysilicon suppliers started to limit market supply,” the analysts said, noting that the price decrease was related to a strong increase in polysilicon capacity across the Chinese industry. “Subsequently, polysilicon prices in China started to rally before the Lunar New Year holiday this January, rising rapidly to the current range of CNY 220 ($47) to CNY 240 per kg.”
They said they believe that the average price of polysilicon will fall by 3.2% from CNY 222/kg in February to CNY 215/kg in March. Wafer prices, meanwhile, will likely drop by 4.3%, from CNY 6.22 per piece to CNY 5.95 for M10 products and from CNY 8.2 to CNY 8 for G12 products.
Average prices for solar cells should decline 3.6% from CNY 1.12 per watt to CNY 1.08 for both M10 and G12 products. The price of M10 and G12 monocrystalline panels, meanwhile, should fall from CNY 1.77 per W in February to CNY 1.74 in March.
“Wafer suppliers significantly raised their capacity utilisation rates because polysilicon supply was expanding again. Therefore, wafer prices will not be able to maintain their upward momentum as supply becomes more plentiful,” TrendForce said. “The temporary tightening of wafer supply also put pressure on cell supply. Nevertheless, there was already widespread anticipation for this round of hikes, so cell buyers mostly accepted higher prices.”
The analysts said module prices will align with the usual range following a drop in prices of materials and components.
“Falling module prices will effectively spur installation demand, and the peak season for installations is expected to arrive earlier compared with the preceding years,” they explained, warning that the Chinese PV industry could face sharp price fluctuations over the short term. “Therefore, module suppliers are mostly optimistic about the market situation from this March onward.”
“In sum, there is still a considerable degree of uncertainty in the development of the global PV market this year,” they concluded.

The BCDA has issued a tender for the construction of a 25 MW solar power plant in New Clark City, in Tarlac province, the Philippines. The authority, which is in charge of transforming former military bases and properties into industrial and economics centers, is leasing a 37-hectare surface for the project. Prospective developers have until April 21 to submit their bids.
“BCDA is offering an initial lease period of 25 years and renewable for another 25 years, upon mutual agreement of the parties,” said the tender document.
In 2021, BCDA signed an agreement with Sunray Power Inc. (SPI) to lease a 260-hectare area in New Clark City for the construction of a 100 MW solar facility. Earlier, BCDA also signed a lease agreement with SSR C-Solar Power Inc. for a 20 MW solar farm. The projects will be developed in what BCDA calls the “buffer zones” of the selected areas, in order to maximise their use through leases.
