CitiPower, Powercor and United Energy – who between them oversee a large proportion of Victoria’s electricity distribution network – said they are offering third parties an opportunity to develop and implement solutions to address load capacity limitations during peak periods for more than 240 sites across their combined grids.
The DNSPs are seeking “non-network or demand-side solutions, such as embedded generation, grid-connected or behind-the-meter battery storage as well as other load management solutions and resources” as part of a plan to enable new energy use, including the increasing penetration of distributed energy resources and “flexibility” markets.
CitiPower and Powercor head of network planning Andrew Dinning said it is the first time all three networks had opened their low-voltage network up to third parties to provide solutions to address constraints that could limit supply or reliability.
“As a distribution system operator, we want to access existing capability and create new markets to help us manage peak demand in the most cost-effective way for our customers,” he said.
“We’re expecting this tender to spark innovative ideas from market participants on both the supply and demand side.”
The distribution companies said the sort of non-network solutions they are seeking could include embedded generation, such as grid-connected or behind-the-meter battery storage, or other demand management solutions and resources.

The projects will predominantly support residential customers and will need to be operating by November. Detailed data and locations of the more than 240 selected sites have been released to the market and are available at United Energy and Citipower and Powercor. The tender closes on 30 May, 2022.
“This is an important step in developing the capability for publishing data on network capacity and constraints that can enable a whole range of new, creative energy solutions for customers as the energy market transforms,” Dinning said.
The network operators are already using demand management programs to address areas of the network reaching their capacity limits. United Energy is trialling pole-top batteries to manage peak demand and improve grid reliability in areas where the low-voltage distribution network is constrained, while Powercor is investing in a community battery that is expected to be in place later this year.
The launch of the tender comes after Powercor earlier this week announced the amount of rooftop solar power being shared between homes and businesses in its network had increased by more than 16% in 2021 to 175,000.
CitiPower and Powercor electricity networks general manager Mark Clarke said more than 23% of Powercor’s customers have a solar system installed on their properties. This increased by more than 23,500 customers during 2021, and combined they are now generating over 700MW – larger than any gas-fired power station, coal-fired generation unit, windfarm or solar farm in Victoria.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/06/territory-reveals-plans-to-reduce-solar-feed-in-tariff/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 6, 2022",Territory reveals plans to reduce solar feed-in tariff,"The Northern Territory (NT) government has announced a new renewable energy scheme which will see rooftop solar PV customers transitioned off the existing premium feed-In tariff (FiT) in favour of a standard rate, a move which is expected to cost an estimated 13,000 customers up to $12 million collectively.
In the countdown to next week’s Budget announcement the NT government on Friday outlined planned changes to government-owned electricity retailer Jacana Energy’s existing premium FiT system.
From 1 July 2022, customers on the electricity retailer’s premium FiT (26.65 cents per kilowatt-hour) will transfer to the standard rate of 9.13 cents per kilowatt-hour after four years – the average time the government estimates it takes to recoup the initial investment costs of a rooftop solar system.
In a statement, the government said the premium FiT, which closed to new entrants in April 2020, was “originally designed to incentivise Territorians to install solar at a time when the industry was in the early stages of development and installation costs were high”.
“Since that time, costs to install solar have drastically declined,” it said.
Renewables and Energy Minister Eva Lawler said the new measures will save the government $12 million annually, which she said will be reinvested into other clean energy initiatives, including community batteries and virtual power plants (VPPs).
“It’s about making sure that we have fairness and equity across all of our solar customers,” she said. “We want clean and affordable power for all Territorians. Budget 2022 sees the Territory focus on renewables – supporting our grid and reaching our 50% target by 2030.”
Lawler said the changes to FiT will be done progressively to ensure customers on the premium rate have realised significant savings during the time they have had solar installed.

Meanwhile, the NT government has confirmed that its Home and Business Battery Scheme will continue with a further $2.4 million allocated in the Budget to extend the scheme in 2022-23.
This is expected to enable more than 400 additional Territory households and businesses to access the program which provides Territory homeowners and businesses with assistance to purchase a battery to suit their needs with a grant of $450 per kilowatt hour of battery system capacity, up to a maximum grant of $6,000.
Lawler said more than 1,330 Territory households and businesses have already submitted applications, with more than 1,000 applications worth $6 million approved.
“We want Territorians to have access to the latest and best technology as we build a stronger and more resilient power system for Territory households and businesses,” Lawler said.
“Extending the Home and Business Battery scheme is one way this government is creating stability in our grid and creating more jobs for Territorians.

To be constructed on a 330-hectare site about four kilometres north of Narrabri, the Silverleaf Solar Farm will comprise approximately 440,000 solar panels installed on single axis trackers. A transmission corridor will also be constructed, supporting 132kV power lines which will connect to Transgrid’s existing Narrabri substation.
Engie has not yet determined a start date for construction but expects the project will take between nine and 12 months to build.
The project builds on Engie’s Australian portfolio which includes 1.1GW of operating gas-fired power plants, 165 MW of operating wind farms and a 2GW pipeline of solar, wind and large-scale batteries under development.

The Australian arm of Canadian clean energy investment firm Amp Energy has announced that the 85MW Hillston Solar Farm in the Riverina region of south-western NSW has achieved 100% generation.
Amp Australia head Dean Cooper said the Hillston solar farm in the state’s south-west has reached full production in less than three months from first energisation.
”Reaching full output ahead of schedule is a testament to the cooperation of all stakeholders, in particular the distribution network service provider Essential Energy, and the proactive management from our local team,” he said.
The Hillston project will generate approximately 235,000MWh of clean energy annually, the equivalent annual power consumption of approximately 48,000 households.
The generation milestone increases Amp’s operating portfolio in Australia to 115MW after the successful energisation earlier this year of its Molong Solar Farm.
The company is also moving ahead with the development of the 1.3GW Renewable Energy Hub of South Australia. The $2 billion hub is to include large-scale solar projects at Robertstown, Bungama and Yoorndoo Ilga totalling up to 1.36GWdc of generation supported by a total battery energy storage capacity of 540MW.

Infrastructure investor Federation Asset Management has agreed to buy a majority stake in the Riverina and Darlington Point battery energy storage project being developed in NSW’s southwest by Australian renewable energy and storage company Edify Energy.
The project, which has a combined 150MW/300MWh of storage capacity spread over three individual but co-located assets, is being developed in the state’s Riverina region. The project comprises the 60MW/120MWh Riverina Energy Storage System 1, the 65MW/130MWh Riverina Energy Storage System 2 and the 25MW/50MWh Darlington Point Energy Storage System.
Federation Asset Management, which paid an undisclosed sum for a majority share in the  project, said it will serve as the seed asset for its Sustainable Australian Real Asset (SARA) fund, pitched as the only energy transition fund focused on Australia.
Edify, which will retain a minority stake in the assets, will manage the construction and commissioning of the battery projects and will act as asset manager for the project.
The project, which plans to connect into Transgrid’s network via the Darlington Point substation, seeks to utilise Tesla’s Megapack systems to provide flexible, dispatchable capacity to the NSW market, and complement the region’s renewable generation, including the 275MW Darlington Point Solar Farm, developed by Edify Energy and UK-based investor Octopus. 
Construction on the project is due to start later this year and be completed by early-2024, with enough potential to power more than 46,000 homes for two hours of peak demand.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/06/sumitomo-says-hydrogen-project-can-show-way-for-sector/,"HYDROGEN,PUMPED HYDRO,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 6, 2022",Sumitomo says hydrogen project can show way for sector,"Japan’s Sumitomo Corporation will partner with Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto to develop a 2MW green hydrogen production facility at the miner’s Yarwun refinery in Gladstone and explore the potential of using hydrogen to replace gas in the alumina refining process.
The pilot project, which is expected to produce up to 300 tonnes of green hydrogen per annum, will also supply the Gladstone Hydrogen Ecosystem, a collaboration comprising Sumitomo, the Gladstone Ports Corporation, Gladstone Regional Council, Australian Gas Networks and CQUniversity Australia.
Sumitomo said the ecosystem has been formed to explore opportunities to develop a hydrogen industry in the region and will initially pursue domestic offtake and mobility solutions before moving to enable large-scale export.
The ecosystem will be complemented by the use of hydrogen to replace gas in the alumina refining process at Yarwun, a project which Sumitomo Australia national hydrogen commercialisation manager Alana Barlow said could provide a pathway for reducing emissions in otherwise hard-to-abate industries.
“The project will produce up to 300 tonnes of green hydrogen per annum, but it is how that hydrogen will be utilised which is critical,” Barlow told the Smart Energy Expo in Sydney on Thursday.
“50% of the hydrogen will be used to seed hydrogen ecosystem projects in Gladstone such as mobility. The other 50% will be used by Rio Tinto to test hydrogen in the alumina refining process at Yarwun to demonstrate over a 24-month period the tolerance levels of hydrogen blends with natural gas where we will provide up to 100% hydrogen.
“If successful, this demonstration will be a critical technological victory for reducing carbon emissions and optimising refineries.”

Barlow said the pilot project, and others like it, are crucial to the development of the hydrogen industry is Australia, saying players need to “show, don’t tell” the community about the benefits.
“It is critical to demonstrate the use of opportunities it presents,” she said. “Small-scale pilot and demonstration labs are essential to this. We need to help people prepare for and take advantage of impending opportunities.”
Barlow said Gladstone is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the global transition to a low-emission energy future, with its established infrastructure, manufacturing capabilities, deep-water port, and skilled local workforce.
“Gladstone, and indeed Australia are at the forefront of this new industry and will be well placed to innovate and develop new technologies,” she said.
Rio Tinto said the green hydrogen pilot plant, which was first announced last year, aligned with its emissions reduction targets and would help decarbonise the the aluminium business, which is a heavy user of electricity.
“Rio Tinto has a long relationship with Sumitomo and we are delighted to partner with them to explore the possibilities of hydrogen, not only for our own refinery, but for Sumitomo to supply industry more broadly in Gladstone,” Rio Tinto Australia chief executive Kellie Parker said in a statement.
“Reducing the carbon intensity of our alumina production will be key to meeting our 2030 and 2050 climate targets. There is clearly more work to be done, but partnerships and projects like this are an important part of helping us get there.”
The Sumitomo pilot project is among a suite of green hydrogen projects planned for the Gladstone area, including a massive “superhybrid” project unveiled this week by Queensland developer Sunshine Hydro and Energy Estate.

Valued at up to $5.5 billion, the Flavian project would incorporate 1.8GW of wind generation and 600MW of pumped hydro with 18 hours of storage. The project would also include 300MW of hydrogen electrolysers, 50MW of liquefaction, and a 50MW hydrogen fuel cell.
Sunshine Hydro chair Michael Myer said once fully operational the Flavian superhybrid project will provide 65 tonnes per day of competitively priced green hydrogen for transport and local industry, as well as 220MW of green energy being supplied 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.
“We will apply our innovative closed loop hydropower model, which selects of a clever mix of energy inputs, outputs, and storage, which we call a superhybrid, to generate reliable green power and green hydrogen,” he said.
The project, to be built at Miriam Vale south of Gladstone, is the first of three similarly sized super-hybrid projects that Sunshine Hydro and its partners are developing in Central Queensland.
“The combination of the long-duration pumped hydro combined with the fast-acting response of PEM (polymer electrolyte membrane) electrolysers can provide grid services second to none,” Myer said.
“Our proprietary software AESOP (Advanced Energy Storage Optimising Program) ensures that these services are available around the clock every day of the year even though the renewable energy sources are variable.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/06/storing-renewables-with-high-rise-elevators/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRIA,BRAZIL,GERMANY,POLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 6, 2022",Storing renewables with high-rise elevators,"An international research team has developed a gravitational energy storage technology for weekly cycles in high-rise buildings in urban environments.
Lift Energy Storage Technology (LEST) is a proposed long-term storage solution. It relies on the use of elevators in buildings to lift solid masses in charging mode. It lowers the same mass to produce electricity in discharge mode.
“Energy is stored as potential energy by elevating storage containers with an existing lift in the building from the lower storage site to the upper storage site,” the scientists said. “Electricity is then generated by lowering the storage containers from the upper to the lower storage site.”
The proposed system could detect the position of containers and optimize available storage capacity in the upper and lower storage sites through dedicated software. Building owners could choose to only operate the system during periods of low elevator demand, in order to minimize its impact on building occupants. The elevators can run at different speeds, depending on storage requirements.
“When the lifts are not being used, such as during the night, the autonomous trailers can fill the lift with containers and the lift can be used to provide ancillary services to the power grid by lifting and descending the mass continuously on grid requirements,” the academics said.
The economic viability of the system depends on the cost of the storage space. If this is low, the scientists said that a mixture of sand and water could be a feasible solution. The number of storage containers depends on a building’s ceiling-bearing capacity.
The researchers assumed that the elevators have regenerative braking capabilities and that the cost of renting the containers’ storage space in the upper and lower sites would be zero.
“The only cost requirements are the containers, the material selected to increase the mass of the containers, and the autonomous trailers,” they said.
Considering an average height difference between the upper and lower reservoirs of 100 meters, the cost of installed capacity energy storage cost was found to be approximately $62/kWh.
“The cost of LEST with an average height difference of 300 meters is $21/kWh, whereas an average height difference of 50 meters costs $128/kWh. This is half of the cost of storing energy with batteries.”
The technical lifetime of the system is estimated between 20 and 30 years and its capacity will be strictly dependent on the number of existing lifts.
“The higher the height difference between the lower and upper storage sites, the lower the cost of the project,” the research team said.
They noted a multi-elevator lift developed by German industrial conglomerate Thyssenkrupp that only uses magnetic force to move the lifts, as an ideal solution for the LEST system.
“This allows the lift to move vertically, horizontally and diagonally, and it is particularly interesting for high-rise buildings because several lifts can travel up or down at the same time in the same shaft,” they said.
The scientists presented the gravitational tech in “Lift Energy Storage Technology: A solution for decentralized urban energy storage,” which was recently published in Energy. The research team includes academics from Austria’s International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), the Federal University of Espírito Santo in Brazil, the Wrocław University of Science and Technology in Poland, and the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences in Germany.
“LEST systems are particularly interesting in buildings with rope-free elevators, and they can also provide tuned mass damper services on the top of very high buildings,” they said. “LEST systems are particularly interesting during the night when most lifts are not being used, as the autonomous trailers can continue to fill the lifts with containers to provide ancillary services to the power grid.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/06/new-water-draining-device-for-rooftop-pv-systems/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,PORTUGAL",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"MAY 6, 2022",New water-draining device for rooftop PV systems,"Portuguese startup Solarud has unveiled a water-draining device that can be clipped to solar modules, in order to resolve dust and soiling issues.
“The piece is usable on panels that have frame heights of 40 mm, 35 mm or 30 mm, and thickness between 8 mm and 11 mm. It is suited for modules with slopes between 3 degrees and 20 degrees,” the company’s co-founder, António Peres, told pv magazine.
The device was designed with rooftop installations in mind, where difficult accessibility and height-related risks make soiling an even greater concern for operations and maintenance contractors. While the device cannot replace cleaning, which remains essential, “the goal is to improve the energy production between cleaning cycles by preventing the soiling impact,” Peres said.
The company claims energy gains of 3.5% on average, with better performance being achieved with solar panels in portrait position, when soiling at the bottom of the module affects all its three substrings.
In a case study, the company showed the gains between two equal strings in the same installation – one installed with Solarud and one without.
“The modules were all cleaned on week zero and we then compared the performance of the strings on week 13,” Peres said.
The company developed and produces the device in Portugal. It is available for bulk purchases, starting at 50 units for $150 (€100), or $3 (€2) per unit. Each piece weighs six grams and is made of UV-resistant recyclable plastic for longer durability.
The company is focused on the European market but distributes globally. Its main clients are investors and project owners seeking fast returns on investment, as well as O&M companies looking to provide better performance alongside their cleaning services.
