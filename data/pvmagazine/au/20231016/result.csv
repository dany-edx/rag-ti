Adam Champion, business development manager for renewables at Ampcontrol, said while the Hydrogen Integrated Stand-Alone Power System (HiSAP), is not yet commercially available, it has been created to explore technical factors across design, integration and operation.
“We will be using these learnings as input into our future renewable energy products,” he said.
The first of the HiSAPS, developed in conjunction with Sydney-based hydrogen energy storage system specialist Lavo and Melbourne-headquartered inverter manufacturer Selectronic Australia, has been installed at Ampcontrol’s LED manufacturing facility at Ringwood in Victoria.
Boundary Power General Manager Simon Duggan said the system utilises the company’s Solar Qube, an integrated, foldout, solar-battery-generator combination, but the traditional diesel generator has been swapped out for a self-contained hydrogen power system developed by Lavo.
“Through the collaboration with Lavo and Selectronic we’ve been able to come up with a uniquely designed solution that paves the way for what we can do in the future with standalone powers systems and renewable energy generation,” he said.
“It allows us to demonstrate the capabilities of this Solar Qube unit being powered by a hydrogen electrolyser and storage system rather than using your traditional diesel generator. This is a really, really, really exciting time.”
The demonstration unit includes two systems: The standalone SAPS comprises a 4 kWp rack-mounted solar array, a 16 kWh battery energy storage system and a 7.5 kW inverter. This is coupled with a 20 kWh metal hydride hydrogen energy storage system (HESS) with an additional 6 kWp solar array (part of a rooftop array at the Ringwood facility) and 5 kWh of battery storage. The HESS also incorporates its own 2.3 kW electrolyser and 3 kW fuel cell to ensure all hydrogen used is renewably created on site.
“One of the unique things about the HiSAPS unit compared to standard stand-alone power systems is that it generates its own fuel internally,” Ampcontrol Research Engineer Thomas Steigler said. “It’s generating hydrogen and storing that within the unit.”
The entire system, including communications equipment for integration into metering and reporting systems, is contained within a weatherproof enclosure.
The newly unveiled demonstration unit will supply solar power to Ampcontrol’s Ringwood facility during daylight hours to meet daytime energy demand. Excess energy will be used to charge the battery energy storage system (BESS) and then the HESS. The BESS will be discharged to meet the power demand at night and during peak periods. The HESS will meet energy demand gaps where solar and BESS energy are not available.
The project was partly funded by the Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action (DEECA) Victoria as part of the state government’s Renewable Hydrogen Commercialisation Pathways Fund.
Duggan said the project has offered an insight into the technology required to build hydrogen systems to store and provide electricity and the demonstration plant will provide crucial insight into the technical, regulatory and safety aspects of integrating hydrogen systems into a stand-alone power system.
“The funding allowed us to collaborate with experts in the field to design an innovative solution to demonstrate real-world application, paving the way for future commercialisation of HiSAPS,” he said.

Andy Scullion, founder and Managing Director of ACE said the partnership with OGEO is an exciting milestone for the Sydney-headquartered company which has a pipeline comprising more than 6 GWp of wind, solar and battery projects.
Included in that are the already approved 129 MW Burdekin and 72 MW Mareeba solar farms in Queensland, and the 150 MW Narrabri and Forbes solar farms in NSW. ACE said all of the projects are to include battery energy storage systems.
Scullion said the partnership with OGEO underscores ACE’s long-term commitment to delivering renewable energy projects in key regions of Queensland and NSW.
“We look forward to developing these projects with OGEO and bringing them towards construction, whilst contributing to both OGEO’s and Australia’s net-zero targets,” he said.
The joint development activities of the partnership, known as Project Genesis, will initially focus on the development of the circa 500 MW solar and storage portfolio but also allows either party to add more projects into the development pipeline.
For OGEO, the joint venture marks the company’s first utility-scale renewable investment in Australia since 2009 when it invested in the 132 MW North Brown Hill Wind Farm at Hallet, in South Australia.
OGEO Director Yo Otsuka said the partnership with ACE affirms the company’s commitment to the energy transition and the development of renewable energy alternatives.
Osaka Gas, one of Japan’s largest energy service providers with more than 7 million customers, is actively pursuing investment opportunities consistent with its promise to achieve carbon neutrality across its global operations by 2050.
As a part of that vision, Osaka Gas plans to deploy 5 GW of renewable energy assets internationally, including solar, wind and biomass power projects, by 2030.
“The partnership with ACE launches our revived focus on renewables investments, in line with our carbon neutral vision which has significant strategic synergies with our long-term goals,” Otsuka said.

CleanCo Chief Executive Officer Tom Metcalfe said the 3 GW total includes project development acquisitions, joint venture investments, and offtake agreements.
“I’m incredibly proud to lead an organisation that has such an ambitious growth agenda. One that is focused on advancing Queensland’s energy transformation, and helping our customers thrive in a net-zero future,” he said.
“We’re looking for renewable energy and firming projects that will help us reach our 2030 goals and contribute to Queensland’s clean energy future.”
“This is a pivotal moment in our journey, and we’re excited to partner with innovative minds and organisations who share our vision and can help deliver the best sustainability solutions for our customers.”
Submissions for the 3 GW close on November 17.
The Queensland government’s renewable energy targets call for an additional 22 GW of new wind and solar projects by 2035, supported by at least 12 GW of storage, firming and dispatchable technologies including grid-scale batteries and pumped hydro storage.
In June, the state government announced it would spend $500 million through CleanCo “to propel the development of large-scale solar and wind projects” in central Queensland.
Last month, CleanCo released an expression of interest seeking up to 400 MW of renewable generation and storage projects to support the development of its Swanbank Clean Energy Hub near Ipswich in Queensland’s southeast.
CleanCo has also been provided funding to install a 250 MW/500 MWh big battery at the Swanbank energy precinct.

Fortescue, which is planning to construct a large-scale green hydrogen production plant near Centralia in the state of Washington, is among a network of hydrogen suppliers and off-takers that make up the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub.
The hub, which includes projects in the states of Washington, Oregon and Montana, is expected to receive up to $1.59 billion in funding, in part to support the development of Fortescue’s Centralia project.
The proposed facility, to be developed adjacent to Washington’s last coal-fired power plant, which is scheduled to be retired permanently in 2025, would produce green hydrogen at scale for use locally in the Pacific NorthWest in heavy-duty transportation, grid reliability, industrial processes, and other hard-to-abate sectors.
Fortescue said the funding will allow it to advance the planning, detailed design, environmental permitting, and procurement of long-lead equipment.
“There is no place better in the world to be investing in renewable and green energy projects right now than the U.S.,” Fortescue Executive Chairman Andrew Forrest said.
“Federal funding like this, alongside other incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, go a long way to helping reduce risk and accelerate the wide-spread production of green hydrogen.”
Fortescue said the Centralia project is currently in the design stage, with full permitting to follow. Project construction is anticipated to start in 2026 and continue into 2028, subject to a final investment decision by the Fortescue board.
The White House said the Pacific NorthWest and the other six selected regional clean hydrogen hubs are collectively expected to produce more than three million metric tons of green hydrogen annually, which is estimated will eliminate 25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions from end uses each year.

Solar panel company Maxeon Solar Technologies will lay off 15% of its total employees by the end of the year to manage the impacts of reduced shipments from one distributed generation (DG) client in North America and an “industry-wide demand slowdown” in global DGl markets, the business announced in a press release yesterday.
Bill Mulligan, Maxeon’s CEO, said in the statement that the company has decided to “streamline” operations, invest in new technologies and develop a mix between DG and utility-scale markets due to the “rapidly changing market and industry conditions.”
“We believe that Maxeon is well positioned to weather this market disruption and come out stronger on the other side,” he said.
The press release mentions that the company’s largest North America-based DG customer recently “breached their payment obligations” and the company paused shipments in late July as a result.
“While this customer has recently made several payments on their outstanding balance and is now close to becoming current, we continue to pause our shipments and engage in good faith towards [the] resolution of certain ongoing claims of breach under the Master Supply Agreement,” Mulligan explained.
“We do not have visibility into how quickly such resolution can be achieved. It is our position that we have firm quantity and pricing contracts in place.”
The 35-year-old Maxeon – based in Singapore but with a presence in 13 0ther countries – expects its third quarter 2023 revenue to be in the range of USD 224—229 million ($355 –362), with shipments between 622 MW—632 MW. The company’s EBITDA, meanwhile, is slated to drop by roughly USD 30 million in Q3 2023 due to the reasons listed above and “inventory adjustments.”
The company will provide further details on Q3 2023 results and Q4 2023 guidance, as well as more information about restructuring activities, during its Q3 2023 earnings call, currently scheduled for November 15, 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/16/combination-of-half-cut-bifacial-solar-cell-designs-may-contribute-to-hotspot-formation/,"QUALITY,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"OCTOBER 16, 2023","Combination of half-cut, bifacial solar cell designs may contribute to hotspot formation","From pv magazine Global
Cutting silicon cells in half, and making them able to generate electricity from sunlight hitting both sides, are two innovations that brought the possibility of increased energy yield at little extra production cost. Consequently, both of these have grown rapidly over the past few years, and now represent the mainstream in solar cell and module manufacturing.
New research, which was among the winners of a poster award at the EU PVSEC conference held in Lisbon last month, has demonstrated that the combination of half-cut and bifacial cell designs may contribute to hotspot formation and performance issues, under certain conditions. And current testing standards, the study’s authors warned, may not be equipped to spot modules vulnerable to this type of degradation.
The researchers, led by Spain-based technical consultancy Enertis Applus, covered parts of a PV module to observe its behaviour under partial shading. “We forced shadowing to take a deep dive into the behaviour of monofacial and bifacial half-cell modules, focusing on hot spot formation and the temperatures these spots reach,” explained Sergio Suárez, global technical manager at Enertis Applus. “Interestingly, we identified mirrored hot spots that emerge in the opposite position with respect to normal hot spots without apparent reasons, like shadowing or breakages.”
The study indicated that the voltage design of half-cell modules may cause hotspots to spread beyond the shaded/damaged area. “The half-cell modules presented an intriguing scenario,” continued Suárez. “When a hotspot emerges, the module’s inherent voltage parallel design pushes other unaffected areas to develop hotspots as well. This behaviour could hint at potentially faster degradation in half-cell modules due to the appearance of these multiplied hotspots.”
The effect was also shown to be especially strong in bifacial modules, which reached hotspot temperatures up to 10 C higher than the single-sided modules in the study. The modules were tested over a 30-day period under high irradiance conditions, with both cloudy and clear skies. The study is soon set to be published in full, as part of the proceedings of the 2023 EU PVSEC event.
According to the researchers, these results reveal a route to performance loss that is not well covered by module testing standards.
“A singular hotspot on the lower part of the module might instigate multiple upper hotspots, which, if not addressed, could accelerate the module’s overall degradation through increased temperature,” said Suárez. He further noted that this could place additional importance on maintenance activities such as module cleaning, as well as system layout and wind cooling. But spotting the problem early on would be preferable to this, and require new steps in testing and quality assurance at the manufacturing stage.
“Our findings spotlight a need and an opportunity to re-evaluate and possibly update standards for half-cell and bifacial technologies,” said Suárez. “It’s essential to factor in thermography, introduce specific thermal patterns for half-cells and adjust the normalisation of thermal gradients to Standard Test Conditions (STC) for bifacial modules.”
