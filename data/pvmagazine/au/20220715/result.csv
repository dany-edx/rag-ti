Labor is framing the transition not just as decarbonisation but as a green economic boom through manufacture of electrolysers, green steel, green cement and green fertiliser. If successful, this will amount to a green industrial revolution.
This radical new vision was laid out in Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s speech this week to the Sydney Energy Forum. He proposed a new era for Australian energy industries and exports as well as using our wealth of renewables to drive deeper involvement in our region.
It makes good commercial and climate sense for the federal government to target the Indo-Pacific for this green industrial revolution, since the region is already the world’s leader in clean energy investments.
As of 2021, our region accounts for over 80% of the world’s private investment in clean energy. India, China, Japan, Korea, Indonesia and Pacific nations are natural partners for Australia in this new green push as well as leaders creating the market for clean energy and green products.

For a sign of what’s to come, look to the massive Sun Cable project, launched four years ago with early funding by Australian billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes of Atlassian and Andrew Forrest of Fortescue Minerals Group.
The project’s ambitious goal is to become the first intercontinental exporter of renewables, by generating massive amounts of energy from solar farms in the Northern Territory and transmitting it to energy-hungry Singapore through a 4,200 km-long high voltage undersea cable. Government backing will help it progress faster.
The project has gained strong support from both territory and federal governments, and is now attracting support from the Indonesian and Singaporean governments. Indonesia’s government has given in principle approval for the cable’s undersea route through its national waters and has approved the undersea survey permit. There will be spillover benefits, such as $1.5 billion earmarked for a marine repair base in Indonesia.
Sun Cable and other renewable megaprojects, such as Western Australia’s proposed Asian Renewable Energy Hub, show the move away from reliance on fossil fuel exports is actually happening. The Albanese government has signalled its intention to promote clean energy exports as well as green industrial development across the Indo-Pacific.
Our research project on the clean energy shift in north-east Asia has captured the progress made by major regional economies China and Korea in powering ahead with their own green transitions since the 2000s. These ongoing transitions offer major opportunities, such as exporting Australian-made green hydrogen to fuel cars in these countries.
Since Labor took office, we’ve heard a lot about our future as a renewables superpower. Often overlooked is the fact this would mean not just generating renewable electricity and green hydrogen at vast scale but also investing in new industries and processes to grasp as many opportunities as we can.
This would mean investing in upstream industries such as solar array fabrication and electrolyser manufacture, as well as downstream industries such as green steel, green cement and green fertiliser. These new green products would be produced using locally generated supplies of green hydrogen and cheap clean renewable power, as economist Ross Garnaut has outlined.
Green energy is no longer a niche concern. Australia’s largest companies are leading the way.
Andrew Forrest’s new spin-off company, Fortescue Future Industries, has begun constructing a $1 billion project building green hydrogen manufacturing components, cabling and renewable generation in central Queensland. This single project is expected to double the global production capacity of green hydrogen. It will make Queensland home to a new green hydrogen fuel and components export industry.
If our new government can pull this off and turn vision to reality, we could embrace a new green growth economy and begin our own green industrial revolution.

For decades, Pacific nations have seen climate change as the single greatest threat to their people. As a result, Australian investment in exportable renewables will become a key diplomatic tool as geopolitical competition between China and the US intensifies in our region.
China isn’t standing still either. Until recently, China focused its regional aid and investment on traditional infrastructure projects such as airports, roads and stadiums. Now Beijing is ramping up its climate responses to the region, with climate change issues at the top of the agenda at the China-Pacific Islands forum held in 2019.
In light of China’s growing green activism in the Pacific, the Australian government has a lot of ground to make up.
It should start with a major rethink of Australia’s traditional approach to financing energy projects, which has seen us support fossil fuel power in the region.
We can no longer keep propping up fossil fuels, with the costs of this support not only environmental, but geostrategic as well. Partnering with China on Pacific projects, as Pacific minister Pat Conroy has flagged, could also help.
Albanese’s speech this week was promising. He laid out a very different role for Australia in our region – one where our regional engagement policy is in line with a new domestic policy on climate goals, and where renewable energy provides a means of deepening regional cooperation on tangible investment projects. Now comes the hard part: delivery.

FRV Australia, which has established itself as one of Australia’s largest solar developers since its arrival in 2010, said the refinancing package was led by French corporate and investment bank Natixis. Canadian government-owned credit agency Export Development Canada (EDC), and NordLB, one of the largest commercial banks in Germany, were also involved in the refinancing manoeuvre.
Christopher Curtain, the senior managing director of Asia-Pacific operations for Omers, which acquired a 49% stake in FRV Australian last year, said the strong support for the refinancing package demonstrated growing investor interest in Australia’s renewables sector and pointed to a bright future for the industry.
“As a long-term investor, we are pleased to note the enthusiastic interest from the broader market in this specific refinancing opportunity,” he said. “This sentiment speaks to lenders’ steadily growing appetite for opportunities to back high-quality renewable assets, which bodes well for Australia’s green energy transition.”
The Lilyvale Solar Farm has been dispatching electricity to the grid since 2019. Located about 50 kilometres northeast of Emerald in central Queensland, the facility has a net annual energy production capacity of approximately 277,150 MWh, capable of meeting the energy demand of up to 45,000 households while also avoiding emissions of 218,900 tons of carbon annually.
FRV Australia managing director Carlo Frigerio said the refinancing package would ensure the asset continues to contribute towards the energy demand and economic development of the local area, while helping to drive Australia’s transition to green energy.

The Lilyvale project was the third solar farm completed by FRV Australia and its first in Queensland. It is underpinned by a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) with Queensland government-owned utility Ergon Energy.
Frigerio said the Lilyvale Solar Farm forms an important part of FRV Australia’s clean energy portfolio, which includes more than 800 MW of utility scale solar PV projects already operational or under construction.
FRV’s Australian portfolio includes the 125 MW Clare Solar Farm in northern Queensland and the 106 MW Winton Solar Farm in Victoria. It also includes the 69.75 MW Goonumbla, the 56 MW Moree, and the 300 MW Walla Walla solar farms, all in New South Wales (NSW). It has also started work on a 5 MW solar-storage hybrid power plant near Dalby in southern Queensland. The Dalby Hybrid Power Plant will comprise 2.4 MW of solar PV capacity and a 2.5 MW/5 MWh battery, making it the first battery energy storage system FRV has developed in Australia.
The company also owns the 115 MW Metz and the 90 MW Sebastopol solar farms, which earlier this year began sending power to the grid in NSW.
Abdul Latif Jameel Energy deputy president and vice chairman Fady Jameel said the company remains committed to paving the way towards a carbon-free world and solar PV is a key element of its strategy.
“Solar farms remain one of the most effective ways to increase sustainable energy generation,” he said. “By supporting Lilyvale solar farm we are further reinforcing our deep commitment to Australia’s transition to green energy.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/15/south-energy-progresses-plans-for-392-mw-of-solar-and-storage-projects/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 15, 2022",South Energy progresses plans for 392 MW of solar and storage projects,"Melbourne-based South Energy said it has secured a string of approvals for three of its proposed solar power and battery energy storage projects, located in Victoria and Western Australia, totalling 392 MW of new generation capacity.
South Energy said the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) had provided Generator Performance Standards (GPS) approval for the 205 MW Campbells Forest Solar Farm being developed on a 360-hectare site near Raywood, about 20 kilometres north of Bendigo in central Victoria.
The large-scale solar and battery project, which secured planning approval in 2020, will include approximately 609,000 solar panels installed on single-axis trackers, a 20 MW/20 MWh battery energy storage facility, and a new terminal station for connection to the existing Bendigo-Kerang 220 kV transmission powerline.
Once complete, the project is expected to generate enough green energy to power about 70,000 average Australian households, helping to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 421,000 tonnes per year.
South Energy described the GPS approval as “one of the most complex and significant milestones for the project” which is being developed in the troubled West Murray Zone of the National Electricity Market (NEM) that straddles northwest Victoria and southwest New South Wales.
Renewable energy generation projects in the weak-grid, high-resource area have had to deal with curtailment issues but South Energy said AEMO has provided its backing for the Campbells Forest project.
“Despite the challenges in the West Murray Zone … AEMO has determined that the project can operate in accordance with the required standards, after completion of a range of detailed studies including a full impact assessment,” the company said in a statement.
“This reflects the project’s technical robustness and South Energy’s meticulous forward thinking when developing large-scale projects at strategic locations.”
South Energy said it will continue to work with AEMO and other parties to complete the connection contracts in the coming months, with the aim of achieving financial close in early 2023.  Construction of the Campbells Forest Solar Farm is targeted to commence in Q2 2023, with commercial operations expected by the end of 2024.

South Energy Technical Director Johan Laban said the company has also secured GPS approval for its $110 million Frasers Solar Farm being developed near Toongabbie in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley.
“The GPS approval is an extensive and at times complex process,” he said. “We are very pleased to have received this approval and would like to express our gratitude to both AEMO and AusNet for their continued support throughout journey, culminating in South Energy achieving this great milestone for the project.”
The 77 MW solar farm is being developed on a 110ha site about 2km south of Toongabbie in the state’s east. The project, which could potentially include an up to 20 MW/40 MWh battery energy storage system, will comprise an estimated 228,000 solar panels and is expected to generate enough clean energy to supply an estimated 29,000 homes.
The project will connect to the grid via AusNet Services’ existing Morwell-Maffra 66 kV distribution powerline which is adjacent to the project site.
South Energy has already obtained planning approval and construction is expected to commence in Q1 2023 with a target commercial operation date of Q3 2024.
The company is also progressing its $150 million Benger Solar Farm project in Western Australia. The Regional Joint Development Assessment Panel (JDAP) has approved South Energy’s plan to build a switchyard as part of the 110 MW solar farm being developed near Wellesley, approximately 140km south of Perth.
Image: South Energy
The switchyard will allow South Energy to establish a micro-grid, offering power generated at the proposed solar facility to commercial clients in the nearby Kemerton industrial area. The company said any excess green power will be exported to the main Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM).
South Energy anticipates commencing construction of the solar farm and switchyard in the first half of 2023 with the project, which also includes capacity for a battery storage system of up to 10 MW/40 MWh, becoming fully operational by the end of 2024.
The Benger Solar Farm is one of two South Energy is developing in WA’s southwest. The company is also pushing ahead with the development of the 210 MW Waroona Solar Farm near the town of the same name, about 115km south of the Benger project.
In its home state of Victoria, South Energy has three more PV projects in the development pipeline, including the West Mokoan (190 MW), Kennedys Creek (145 MW) and Goorambat (75 MW) solar farms.

The market report shows that on average 68.3% of the state’s daily power needs were met by a combination of wind and solar in 2021-22, an increase of 7% on the previous financial year. Large-scale wind provided 45.2% of the state’s energy needs while utility scale and rooftop solar delivered another 23.1% of the state’s energy needs.
“These results show that there is no doubt that South Australia continues its leadership in renewable energy,” Deputy Premier Susan Close said.
“Wind and solar coupled with the new green hydrogen industry will see our state lead the way in decarbonisation and lower power prices for all South Australians.
“South Australia’s aspirational goal towards carbon neutrality is now within reach.”
SA has committed to reach net 100% renewables by 2030 with plans to generate renewable electricity locally equal to 100% of its annual demand.
The state could achieve that ambition well before the end of the decade with the OpenNEM report showing that on some days in the 2020-21 financial year, SA’s solar and wind resources provided more power than the state needed, including 150% of requirements on November 27 last year.
There was also a six-day period leading up to December 29 when renewables provided more than 100% of the electricity used while on October 11 last year the state’s power grid was powered completely by solar. It is reportedly the largest jurisdiction in the world to achieve the milestone.

Close said with more than $6 billion investment in large-scale renewable energy and storage projects to date and more than $30 billion in the investment pipeline, SA’s use of green energy is expected to grow further during the next 12 months.
“We will supply South Australians with affordable, clean, green energy, with enough left over to export to other countries, providing additional income streams for our state,” she said.
South Australia has a growing number of new projects being developed. French renewables developer Neoen has started early works on its Goyder Renewables Zone, a project which has been granted development approval for a total of 1200 MW of wind generation, 600 MW of solar generation and 900 MW of battery storage capacity. GFG Alliance is building the 280 MW Cultana Solar Farm near Whyalla while
Amp Power Australia has set out plans for a 1.3 GW Renewable Energy Hub which would include solar projects at Robertstown (636 MW), Bungama (336 MW) and Yoorndoo Ilga (388 MW), supported by a total energy storage capacity of 540 MW.
The SA government has also targeted renewable hydrogen projects with plans to to transform state  into a renewable energy exporter of world standing within the next decade.

BOC will supply and install the refuelling station at bp’s Port of Brisbane service station in Lytton, using technology developed by parent company Linde.
The refuelling facility will dispense green hydrogen produced by BOC at its nearby Bulwer Island production site. The green hydrogen will be produced by a 220 kW electrolyser powered by a 100 kW solar installation.
BOC said the Bulwer Island facility will produce up to 2,400 kilograms of green hydrogen a month, with up to 50kg made available daily for the refuelling station. It is expected the hydrogen refuelling station will have capacity to refill a hydrogen car in 3-5 minutes with the Queensland government’s current fleet of five hydrogen-powered Hyundai NEXOs set to be the first to use the facility when it opens in the next few months.

BOC South Pacific managing director John Evans said the partnership with bp Australia is an important step forward in developing a hydrogen refuelling service station network in Queensland.
“BOC is committed to supporting the development of hydrogen as a zero-emissions fuel and decarbonising the transport sector in Australia,” he said. “Working closely with our partner bp we will demonstrate how state-of-the-art hydrogen refuelling stations can be safely integrated into the existing service station network, paving the way for more infrastructure to facilitate hydrogen trucks and buses.”
For bp, which has committed to become a net zero company by 2050 at the latest, the facility serves as a pointer to the future with the company predicting green hydrogen will play a critical role in the future energy and mobility mix.
Frédéric Baudry, the president of bp Australia and head of its fuels and low carbon solutions business in the Asia Pacific, said hydrogen will “be essential in decarbonising industry and transport”.
“Bp has extensive industrial experience with hydrogen and is now linking that with our expertise in supplying energy to the world, creating end-to-end offers and decarbonisation solutions for our customers,” he said. “We are excited to be developing and deploying innovative offers that meet the changing mobility needs of our customers’ today and for the future.”

Queensland Energy Minister Mick De Brenni said the hydrogen refuelling stop will serve as a critical link in the vision for an east coast ‘hydrogen superhighway’, saying it is critical that locally made fuel continued to be available to power the nation’s heavy transport sector as it moved to lower its emissions.
“The importance of this for our economic future cannot be overstated because this is another link in the supply chain, ensuring Queensland cements its status as a global force in the hydrogen industry,” he said.
“From hydrogen-powered trucks and coaches to trains and marine vessels, we are exploring every opportunity to capitalise on the opportunities of Queensland’s energy transformation.
“And here at Lytton, it will help Queensland power its way towards an emissions-free future as hydrogen-powered vehicles start to hit the road.”
The Lytton facility, which has been partially funded by ARENA and the Queensland government, joins two other publicly available hydrogen refuelling stations in Australia: one in Canberra run by ActewAGL, and another operated by Toyota at its former factory in Altona, Victoria.

That was partly because so many of the world’s large-scale solar projects have a long lead in times and contractual clauses limiting cost increases, according to a new report published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) this week. The result was a global solar electricity cost of US$0.048/kWh, according to the IRENA study. China once again posted the lowest solar LCOE at US$0.034/kWh in 2021, but there were notable reductions in Australia, where solar was 21% cheaper than in 2020, at US$0.042/kWh. Japan, meanwhile, recorded a 17% year-on-year decline to US$0.086/kWh.
India offered the world’s second cheapest solar power, at US$0.035/kWh, in part thanks to the world’s lowest PV project costs which, at US$590 per kilowatt of generation capacity installed, were 6% lower than Chinese solar farm prices. Most of the world’s biggest markets saw their solar plant investment costs fall in 2021, but policy uncertainty in pre-invasion Ukraine drove up project expenses by 17%, year on year, resulting in a solar LCOE of US$1.117/kWh.
Spain also saw project costs rise by 3%. That reflected the hyper-competitive, unsubsidized plants that came online in 2020, but did not appear on the same scale last year, when developments cost an average $916 per kilowatt and the LCOE was US$0.048/kWh. Vietnam posted a solar LCOE of $0.046/kWh last year, with solar electricity costing US$0.055 per unit of power in the United States, and US$0.064 in Turkey.
The report’s authors suggest the solar price rises bottled up last year are likely to feed into the market this year in the shape of 3% to 5% project cost increases – of US$20 toUS $60 per kilowatt installed – in the world’s 10 biggest solar markets. That would translate into a 2% to 4% rise worldwide for utility-scale solar and a 2% global rise in the cost of solar electricity.
The document pointed out, however, the soaring price of fossil fuels this year, in particular gas, means the solar capacity added last year – and accumulated to date – has brought huge savings. The report stated: “It remains remarkable that more effort has not been made to accelerate renewable power generation deployment in 2022, over the past nine months.”
IRENA estimated the solar capacity added last year reduced power generation costs by around US$11.3 billion, compared with today’s fossil fuel costs, including a US$1.3 billion saving in non-OECD countries. The solar added in such nations from 2010 to last year is saving around US$2.7 billion per year at today’s fossil fuel prices, the report added.
For its headline figure, IRENA said almost two-thirds of the clean power generation capacity added in 2021 (some 163 GW) was installed at a lower cost than the cheapest fossil fuel-based alternative.

GlobalData has predicted that growing public support and rapidly expanding low-carbon hydrogen capacity will drive the global electrolyser market to 8.52 GW by 2026. In a new report, it noted that electrolyser capacity has doubled over the past five years, to around 0.3 GW by the middle of 2021. Global hydrogen production from electrolysers could exceed 8 million metric tons by 2030, it said, adding that the Asia-Pacific region has thus far dominated demand for electrolyser capacity.
BP and Thyssenkrupp have signed a memorandum of understanding to develop long-term supplies of low-carbon hydrogen and renewable power for steel production. The companies will explore supply options for blue and green hydrogen, as well as power from wind and solar generation through power purchase agreements. Thyssenkrupp Steel aims to replace coal-fired blast furnaces with direct reduction plants where iron ore is reduced with low-carbon hydrogen, in order to make steel production climate-neutral over the long term, said the German industrial group. 
Nel Hydrogen has secured a purchase order from Viva Energy for a MC500 containerised PEM water electrolyser. “The electrolyser will be the biggest in Australia and provide green hydrogen to a fleet of heavy fuel cell vehicles,” said the Norwegian company. Earlier this month, Nel Hydrogen won a purchase order for an alkaline electrolyser system from Skovgaard Energy Aps in Lemvig, Denmark. The electrolyser system will be used to produce green ammonia with wind and solar.
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said that international trade via pipelines and ships could support about one-quarter of global hydrogen demand. “With falling costs of renewables and the hydrogen potential exceeding global energy demand by 20-fold, three-quarters of global hydrogen would still be produced and used locally in 2050. This is a significant change from today’s oil market, where the bulk is internationally traded,” said IRENA. It sees about half of all hydrogen being traded through repurposed gas pipelines, while shipped green ammonia would account for most of the other half.
Peugeot has allowed journalists to test its e-EXPERT Hydrogen van for the first time in trials in Rüsselsheim, Germany, where its production line is located. The van is based on a system featuring a battery that can be recharged from the mains, with a fuel cell-powered by hydrogen in the canisters under the vehicle floor.
The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia’s national science agency, has agreed to collaborate with the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the hydrogen sector. “A 100% renewable system would not be entirely made up of wind and solar, but include other renewables such as hydropower, biomass, and green hydrogen,” said CSIRO, noting that electrolyser costs are falling rapidly.

An international research team has developed a new approach to energy storage technologies that does not exclusively consider costs, as it also considers their interaction with energy systems.
The scientists said their “market potential method” can be used to simultaneously analyse multiple energy storage systems. “We show that current cost metrics can be misleading for technology design decisions,” they said. “A narrow cost focus on designing energy storage is not enough.”
The researchers stressed the importance of discovering the “hidden values” of storage technologies. They said network or peak plant deferral, or reduced solar and wind power plant curtailments, are hidden variables that are often neglected in storage cost analysis.
They apply their method in two phases. It initially focuses on a market potential indicator (MPI) and then defines market potential criteria to support design decisions.
“The MPI is not a new metric,” the scientists said. “It is a result of energy system models that analyse scenarios in future energy systems and describes the total quantity of a particular storage technology in a cost minimised electricity system.”
The scientists used the new approach to look at how different hydrogen storage technologies could be adopted across several European markets. They found that technologies with high or low levelised costs of storage (LCOS) could have good market potential.
“Not always a technology with the lowest investment or LCOS is most valuable,” they said. “It can also be the more expensive technology that can lead to a cheaper future electricity system.”
They described their findings in “Beyond cost reduction: improving the value of energy storage in electricity systems,” which was recently published in Carbon Neutrality. The research group includes scientists from the University of Edinburgh, Technische Universität Berlin, and the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO).
The team said the “market potential method” could help to identify potential growth markets, assess future cost reductions, and reduce the structural uncertainty of linear programming energy system models.
“The results suggest looking beyond the pure cost reduction paradigm and focus on developing technologies with suitable value approaches that can lead to cheaper electricity systems in future,” they said.
