In addition to purchasing the consortium’s patented recovery process, La Mia Energia’s co-founder Dr Francesco and his team of engineers will come to Australia to assist in setting up the first processing plants and to oversee the replication of the company’s European business model in Australia.
The companies say La Mia Energia’s patented clean technology recovers more than 99% of “all types” of end-of-life solar panels without using crushing, chemicals, thermal processing, or pyrolysis techniques.
The first two processing plants will be in Biloela, in central Queensland, and Townsville, on the state’s north coast. The plants are expected to fully operational by March 2022.
Solar Recovery Corporation says it is planning a national expansion “within the next 24 months.”
The partnership will see Solar Recovery Corporation exclusively secure La Mia Energia’s patented clean technology for both Australia and New Zealand.
Solar Recovery Corporation is headquartered in Victoria and hasn’t specified why it has opted to set up both plants in Queensland. The company appears to have been incorporated in January last year, with little information available online to date.
The company’s advisory board chairman, Rob Gell, who is also executive director of ReThink Sustainability said circular economy technology is where the solar industry must head.
“Beyond recycling, materials recovery, product stewardship and Extended Producer Responsibility are the new order,” Gell said.  “We cannot afford to dispose of valuable materials that can be revalued and repurposed, ideally into new solar panels, through the adoption of leading technology such as this.”
The panels’ recovered materials will be made available for repurpose into a range of manufacturing streams, which the company says will reduce CO2 emissions, the need for virgin minerals, and provide a circular economy solution for Australia’s growing panel problem.
Australia has one of the highest uptakes of rooftop solar in the world, with more than 3 million homes now using solar panel power but an increasing number of modules are entering the waste stream as they reach their end-of-life while others are being discarded prematurely as technological advances increase efficiency and reduce costs of new modules.
Researchers from the University of South Australia have estimated that more than 100,000 tonnes of solar modules will enter the waste stream by 2035 and currently almost all expired or discarded solar panels in Australia go into landfill.
An increasing number of bodies in Australia are looking to jump-start solar recycling and recovery, with Reclaim PV expanding its operations last year. Likewise, in December the University of Melbourne and RMIT University announced their partnership with the Melbourne-based company OJAS to develop a solar ‘upcycling’ facility.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/21/billionaire-to-pursue-agl-takeover-despite-board-rejection/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 21, 2022",Climate-driven billionaire to pursue AGL takeover despite board rejection,"On Saturday, a consortium made up of Mike Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures and fund manager Brookfield put in a bid to acquire 100% of AGL Energy, Australia’s largest electricity generator and the nation’s largest carbon emitter, for approximately $8 billion.
This morning, AGL rejected the “unsolicited” offer, saying it “materially undervalues the company” and was “not in the best interests” of shareholders. 
The consortium remains undeterred. It will continue to work with AGL’s board to reach an acquisition agreement, Cannon-Brookes said. The news pushed AGL’s share price up more than 12%.

Driven by what he sees as one of the country’s greatest economic opportunities, as well as a climate imperative, Cannon-Brookes told ABC’s RN Breakfast this morning that the consortium’s shock takeover bid was a “sensible play” it is committed to pursuing. 
On top of its acquisition budget, he said the consortium has access to $20 billion to invest in decarbonising AGL, and more broadly Australia. With this capital it plans to invest in new renewable assets, contracting external renewable developments, as well as storage, firming and “the infrastructure required to make [the transition] happen.”

“We have $20 billion to fund the transition ourselves, and obviously as a private company we can fund the transition faster than as a public company,” Cannon-Brookes said.
The consortium plans to replace AGL’s 7GW of fossil-fuel capacity through a “build-out of at least 8GW of clean energy and storage,” it said.
Cannon-Brookes added that he believes one unified AGL is the best way to bring this plan to fruition, describing the consortium’s takeover as a “far better option than the demerger which is on the table.” 
Cannon-Brookes is among Australia’s richest people having made billions from co-founding software company Atlassian, where he remains CEO. He is an ardent advocator for climate action and has invested significantly in the renewables sector.

With the bid, Cannon-Brookes and Brookfield are seeking to accelerate the retirement of AGL’s extensive coal-fired power plants in New South Wales and Victoria. 
The consortium has flagged it plans to retire all three of AGL’s sizeable coal plants by 2030 – far more ambitious than AGL’s schedule to have its Loy Yang A plant in Victoria remain open until 2045 and its New South Wales Bayswater plant until 2033. The Liddell coal power plant is already on track to close next year.
Cannon-Brookes said the consortium plans to cut 15 years from AGL’s net zero target, which would be crucial for aligning it with Paris targets keeping global warming below 1.5°C, he told ABC Radio.

AGL accounts for over 8% of Australia’s emissions, with Cannon-Brookes pointing out the company is responsible for more carbon pollution than the entirety of Sweden, Ireland or New Zealand.
“If successful, this will be one of the biggest decarbonisation projects in the world today and show Australia is capable of globally significant projects,” Cannon-Brookes said. 
The Toronto-headquartered fund management company Brookfield would invest in AGL via its Brookfield Global Transition Fund. 
The fund in the “final stages” of raising US$15 billion (AU$21 billion), Brookfield said, claiming the title of world’s largest fund focused on transition investments. “The investment in AGL would be the largest investment from the fund to date, not only in terms of capital invested but also in terms of the expected renewables build out and carbon reduction,” Brookfield added.

Brookfield recently acquired Victorian network utility AusNet Services, which owns and operates the majority of the state’s transmission network infrastructure, as well as a large proportion of its electricity and gas distribution network. 
It has been flagged that any takeover of AGL by Brookfield would likely be closely examined by the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC).
As a company, AGL has been struggling. AGL stocks are currently at a 20-year low with its demerger plans failing to excite enthusiasm on the stock market. At the end of 2021, AGL’s share price was less than one-fifth of its 2017 peak.
In September, 55% of AGL shareholders voted for the company to adopt Paris-aligned climate targets in both of its demerged businesses. The vote was hailed as the largest ever contested resolution in Australian corporate history.
This is an incredibly momentous event in the history of climate in Australia. Wow. Wow.
👏🏻 @brynnobrien and @AustCCR team on their @AGLAustralia resolution.
You put a dent in the future timeline of the world today. https://t.co/0HH6WeslLp

Cannon-Brookes and the consortium look to be leaning into this shareholder upset, with the billionaire saying of its takeover plan: “ultimately, I believe the decision is up to the shareholders, so we are putting our case forward.”
The Brookfield & Grok Venture consortium offered AGL $7.50 a share, a 4.7% premium on Friday’s closing price of $7.16. The consortium said its offer represented a circa 20% premium to the three-month volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of AGL’s $6.28 per share.
After meeting to discuss the offer on Sunday, AGL’s board deemed the bid short.
Yet the consortium insists the offer, and presumably the future offers it is alluding to, would be far more valuable to shareholders than AGL’s current demerger plan, which would see the company separate into AGL Australia, the forward-facing ‘green’ business and Accel Energy, which would retain the company’s fossil fuel generation assets.
The consortium sees this plan as highly unattractive, saying it would  “significantly dis-synergies” AGL in a letter to the company’s management. “The pressure to fund decommissioning and energy transition with reduced balance sheet capacity will undermine investor appetite and the financial viability of Accel Energy and, when added to significant one-off costs, diminish the potential benefits of any prospective demerger,” it said.

Funding will be available for light vehicle fleet operators for charging and electrical infrastructure, while heavy fleet operators are eligible for funding towards enabling infrastructure and some support for vehicle costs. 
ARENA is also looking to fund projects that incorporate hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and refuelling infrastructure.
Under Round 1, ARENA awarded $24.55 million to five companies for the construction of 403 electric vehicle fast charging stations spread across every state and territory. 
ARENA CEO Darren Miller described it has “the largest ever expansion of public fast charging infrastructure in Australia.” The first of these charging stations opened for public use in November 2021.
“Assisting fleet users to move to zero emissions vehicles (ZEV) means getting more zero emission cars and trucks on the road sooner, driving the road transport sector toward a net zero future,” Miller said.
“By getting these vehicles on the road as soon as possible we’ll reduce emissions in the short term and help to create a market for second hand vehicles in the future, giving more consumers the option of switching to a ZEV with their next vehicle purchase.”
With the additional funding, the total value of the Future Fuels Fund has been brought to $250 million. The fund aims to deliver on the Future Fuels and Vehicles Strategy released by the federal government at the end of 2021.
Future targeted funding rounds under the program will focus on further expansions to the electric vehicle public charging network, including regional areas, as well as increasing the use of smart chargers in drivers’ homes, ARENA said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/21/india-introduces-green-hydrogen-policy/,"HYDROGEN,POLICY,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"FEBRUARY 21, 2022",India introduces green hydrogen policy,"From pv magazine India
India has unveiled its green hydrogen policy as a step towards meeting the objectives of the National Hydrogen Mission launched by the prime minister last year. 
The National Hydrogen Mission aims to make India a green hydrogen hub, enabling the nation to meet its climate targets while reducing its fossil fuel import bills. It targets the production of 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 and the related development of renewable energy capacity.
Hydrogen plays a critical role in the Indian economy, with roughly 6 million tons of hydrogen consumed annually, primarily in ammonia and methanol production and for use in refineries. A report from the Energy and Resources Institute estimates that demand for hydrogen could grow to as much as 28 million tons by 2050. 
Virtually all the hydrogen consumed in India today is grey (hydrogen produced using fossil fuels), the production of which emits roughly 9 tons of CO2 per ton of hydrogen. Therefore, enabling cost-effective domestic production of green hydrogen (utilising renewable electricity) is critical for India to reduce the carbon intensity of heavy industry and help achieve its energy security and emissions targets.
With hydrogen and ammonia envisaged as the future fuels, the government is determined to facilitate their production using renewable sources of electricity instead of fossil fuels/fossil fuel-based feedstocks.
The policy is designed to promote the production of green hydrogen and green ammonia by easing the process of renewable energy purchase, storage, and transmission for the manufacturers. 
Green hydrogen/ammonia manufacturers can purchase renewable power from the power exchange or set up renewable energy capacity themselves or through any other developer anywhere. For such plants, open access will be granted within 15 days of receipt of application. They can bank their unconsumed renewable power, for up to 30 days, with the distribution company and take it back when required.
Distribution licensees can also procure and supply renewable energy to the manufacturers of green hydrogen/green ammonia in their states at concessional prices, which will only include the cost of procurement, wheeling charges, and a small margin as determined by the State Commission.
Further, green hydrogen and green ammonia manufacturers shall be allowed a 25-year waiver of inter-state transmission charges for the projects commissioned before June 30, 2025. ISTS connectivity for the renewable energy capacity set up to manufacture green hydrogen/green ammonia shall be granted priority.
Hydrogen and ammonia producers and distribution licensees will be eligible for incentive benefits from the renewable purchase obligation (RPO) for the consumption of renewable power.
Among other measures, the ministry of new and renewable energy is setting up a single portal to carry out all the activities, including statutory clearances, in a time-bound manner.
Green hydrogen and green ammonia producers will be allowed to set up bunkers near ports for storage of green ammonia for export and use by the shipping sector. The land for the storage for this purpose shall be provided by the respective port authorities at applicable charges.
To further encourage the usage of green hydrogen by industries, the fuel has been included under RPO regulations.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/21/mobile-solar-pump-for-remote-areas/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"FEBRUARY 21, 2022",Mobile solar pump for remote areas,"From pv magazine India
Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar have designed and developed a solar system for water pumping which can easily be moved from one farm to another. The kit is useful for pumping water in remote areas and helps small scale farmers who could pool money to use the equipment on a shared basis.
The technology has already been deployed in hard-to-reach areas of the state of Odisha.
IIT Bhubaneswar academics Srinivas Bhaskar Karanki, of the school of electrical sciences, and Satish D Dhandole, from the school of mechanical sciences, led the project.

Karanki told pv magazine: “We have used a tractor trolley for the movable system. The trolley is designed to have a foldable structure to accommodate six panels. The trolley needs to be attached with the tractor head to move from one place to another. The system works with two different types of pumps, one submersible and the other surface-mounted. The surface-mount is taken along with the movable SPV [solar photovoltaic] system. Further, the movable structure is equipped with an inverter.”  
The system can generate enough power to operate submersible and monoblock-pump AC motors even at low irradiation. The inverter circuitry is designed to achieve maximum solar energy harvesting with single-stage power conversion from DC to AC, thereby increasing reliability and reducing the overall cost.
The system can also be operated from a single-phase grid electricity supply, if needed, and is designed to operate a 2hp AC pump with the inverter able to accommodate up to 5hp loads.
The mobile solar pumps have been installed in 13 locations in districts including Angul, Dhenkanal, Puri, Bhadrak, Korput, Keonjhar, Nayagarh, and Mayurbhaj. Three more systems have been installed in the villages of Podapada, Kanaspada, and Khudupur, with those settlements having been adopted by IIT Bhubaneswar under the government’s Unnat Bharat Abhiyan policy, which aims to leverage scientific advances developed in academic institutions in rural settings.
The mobile solar project is funded by the Directorate of Agriculture and Food Production of the government of Odisha under the central government’s Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana agricultural development program.
