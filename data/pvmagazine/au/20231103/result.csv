Genex said the completion of the approximately 1.5-kilometre tunnel ensures access for the power station cavern lower bench excavation works and ultimate fit-out activities.
Genex Chief Executive Officer Craig Francis said the completion of the tunnel marks a major milestone for the project after it was forced to adjust the course of the tunnel following a drilling incident late last year that set construction back. The incident, in September, resulted in water unexpectedly leaking into the tunnel.
“We are extremely pleased with the way in which the Genex and EPC contractor teams responded to the water ingress event last year, completing the redesign and recommencing production with minimal delay,” Francis said.
“Importantly it moves us one step closer toward commencing the power station fit-out works ahead of energisation later in 2024.”
Being developed at the site of two abandoned gold mine pits near Kidston, about 270 kilometres northwest of Townsville in northern Queensland, the Kidston Pumped Hydro Storage Project involves the transfer of water between the two disused gold mine pits which are located at different elevations. Water stored in the upper reservoir will drop about 220 metres down two vertical inlet shafts through reversible turbine-generators – to be located approximately 250 metres below ground level – into the lower reservoir to generate electricity.
Once complete, the facility will have the potential to generate up to 250 MW of rapid response, flexible power to the National Electricity Market. It will have a start-up time of less than 30 seconds, allowing it to respond quickly to any shortages of electricity supply.
The facility will generate enough electricity to power more than 140,000 homes for eight hours.
Electricity provider EnergyAustralia will operate the pumped hydro storage asset for up to 30 years having finalised a binding energy storage services agreement.

Larrakia, a joint venture initiative between Aboriginal organisation Larrakia Development Corporation and Perth-based resource and renewables company Progressive Green Solutions, is part of a consortium of Australian and international partners aiming to develop a 300 MW solar farm on land near the Middle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct.
Earlier this year, Larrakia and South Korean government-owned Korea Midland Power signed a memorandum of understanding with the Northern Territory government to progress the development of the proposed Green Energy Project.
Perth-based Tivan has now signed an agreement to source clean energy from the proposed solar farm to support its plans to develop a facility at Middle Arm, for processing vanadium sourced from its Speewah project in northern Western Australia.
It is the second power purchase deal signed by Tivan this year, having already signed a letter of intent with the developer of the giant Sun Cable solar and battery project planned for the Northern Territory.
Tivan Executive Chairman Grant Wilson said the company’s intent is to process vanadium into electrolyte at Middle Arm as part of a plan to build a full battery value chain across northern Australia.
“We are advancing the renewable value chain for long duration energy storage in rapid time, including with local and global counterparts,” he said, adding that the agreement with Larrakia will add further momentum to these initiatives.
The company said the proposed plant would be capable of producing 500 MWh of vanadium electrolyte per annum.

Located within the Sun Metals Green Industrial Precinct in Townsville, SunHQ will produce green hydrogen through a behind-the-meter connection to the neighbouring 124 MW Sun Metals Solar Farm. Compression, storage and refueling facilities will be located adjacent to the electrolyser.
SunHQ is expected to produce approximately 155 tonnes of green hydrogen per annum, about 90 tonnes of which will be used to power five of the world’s heaviest fuel cell electric trucks (FCET) that will ply the 30-kilometre route from the Sun Metals refinery to Townsville Port, and back.
Ark Energy will acquire five Hyzon Motors’ 140-tonne rated FCETs and lease them to sister company Townsville Logistics (also a subsidiary of Korea Zinc) which will use them to transport zinc concentrate from the port to the refinery and zinc ingots from the refinery to the port. The trucks will replace five existing diesel prime movers, avoiding an estimated 1,300 tonnes of carbon emissions every year.
Ark Energy Chief Executive Officer Daniel Kim said he expects the project to demonstrate the functionality and versatility of hydrogen fuel-cell electric trucks, helping to accelerate the decarbonisation of the heavy transport sector.
“We’re excited about the catalytic potential of SunHQ to build the domestic hydrogen economy of north Queensland and bring forward the decarbonisation of Australia’s ultra-heavy transport sector by several years,” he said.

It is anticipated that the production and testing of green hydrogen from SunHQ will commence early next with the first FCET expected to be delivered by the end of Q2 2024.
Kim said in addition to Ark Energy’s own requirements, there will be additional capacity for the facility to supply green hydrogen to third-party customers.
“We have deliberately oversized the capacity of SunHQ to ensure there is surplus green hydrogen to support other major industrial customers achieve their emissions reductions targets,” Kim said.
Further phases of the project are expected to build on the domestic market and develop export opportunities for green hydrogen into Korea.
The SunHQ project has received a $3.02 million grant from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and is being supported by a $12.5 million debt finance facility from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC). It has also been supported with funding of up to $8 million from the Queensland government’s Hydrogen Industry Development Fund.

Solar module microcracks are emerging as an increasing, recurring issue detected by visual inspections combined with electroluminescence (EL), a new report from Clean Energy Associates (CEA) shows.
The Denver-based clean energy advisory company came to this conclusion by testing samples from 16 countries over eight years.
“EL testing of more than 300,000 PV modules at 148 sites has shown that 83% of the sites had line cracks, 78% had a soldering anomaly, and 76% had complex cracks,” the report said. “The most surprising finding was the recent massive increase in microcracks.”
According to the report, published yesterday, CEA experts found that about 29% of the sites were impacted by edge-ribbon cracks, as well as 81% of sites with half-cut cells. There was an exponential growth of microcrack cases in the first half of 2023, with line and complex cracks both growing 47% compared to a year earlier, the report said.
CEA said roughly 55% of the sites had unwanted substances or debris that were not present within the module, and 52% had cell-to-edge glass defects. The report said that 45% of the sites had glass stains and encapsulant defects, while 41% had stringing wire/ribbon offpad defects.
Additionally, the survey found 41% of sites had cell-to-cell defects and laminate bubbles.

New Mexico-based CSolPower LLC is partnering with Sandia National Laboratories to research and develop the use of landscape gravel as a thermal energy storage medium for intermittent sources of generation like solar and wind.
The system is comprised of rocks held in a bed that are heated or cooled with air to store thermal energy. Sandia’s researchers said the gravel from landscaping companies can be successfully used for the system without requiring extensive washing or preparation.
Sandia designed a small 100 kWh test project at its National Solar Thermal Test Facility. PV panels are installed at the site, which is being tested for its ability to store intermittent generation.
“One of the advantages of thermal energy storage in rocks is that it can be built anywhere,” said Walter Gerstle, co-founder of CSolPower. “It can be commodified and doesn’t require extensive permitting. We believe it can be implemented more quickly and economically than other approaches.”
The rock bed is a long-duration energy storage system, a category of energy storage that has introduced creative solutions like gravity-based storage, rusted iron pellets, and thermal bricks.
Sandia tested the bed by charging it with heated air greater than 900 F (482 C) and maintained that temperature for up to 20 hours. The system was successfully discharged, and Sandia said the performance of the system has been in-line with modelling and predictions. The lab said prototype testing will continue until June 2024.
CSolPower said it intends to make the product ready for utility-scale use, but first it will develop small-scale versions.
“A natural approach is to store excess electricity generated during the day as heat, and then use it to heat water and homes at night,” said Gerstle. “This is an example of the small-scale use of this storage option.”
If the current phase of testing is successful, several greenhouses in northern New Mexico are prepared to use the rock bed storage in another pilot project.
“Instead of curtailing solar energy production, we would store it and use it during cold nights to keep the greenhouses warm enough to grow plants year-round,” said Gerstle.
The project is financed by the Technology Readiness Gross Receipts Initiative. Sandia’s economic development department administers the tax-funded program, which enables New Mexico businesses to work alongside scientists and engineers from Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories.
