Initially planned to have a capacity of 200 MW / 800 MWh, the company today confirmed its scope had grown and the battery will now be targeting a storage duration of 1,244 MWh. While the battery’s revised power output has not be confirmed, it will presumably sit at around 311 MW. 
The Victorian government approved the Elaine battery’s Planning Application just weeks ago, on November 17, but the public documents relating to the project still revolve around the initial proposed capacity of 200 MW / 800 MWh.
The project was initially forecast to require an investment between $400 – $500 million (USD 260 to 327 million). Again according to those earlier planning documents, the battery project was anticipated to cover a six hectare area. It is to be located 5 kilometres north west of the Victorian town of Elaine, sitting directly adjacent to the Elaine Terminal Station.
Akaysha Energy, which was acquired by US investment giant BlackRock in 2022, has been kicking goals in the Australian storage market. That same year it was awarded the contract for the 850 MW / 1,680 MWh Waratah Super Battery Project in New South Wales, despite not yet having developed an Australian battery project.
On Wednesday, it was announced the company had also won the NSW tender for its 415 MW / 1,660 MWh Orana battery.
Like the Orana battery, the Elaine battery is set to have four hours of storage. Until very recently, almost all Australia’s big lithium battery proposals and projects had no more than two hours of storage. Akaysha Energy’s CEO and managing director, Nick Carter, says four hours is set to be the “new normal” for duration in Australia.
“At Akaysha Energy, we are bullish on longer duration systems such as this four-hour system. Our in-house markets modelling, engineering and technical teams have all combined to provide us a strong view that four hours is the new normal for BESS duration in Australia,” he said.

Testing and commissioning on the 130 MW (DC) Glenrowan solar farm began early this month, with Cimic announcing it achieved first energisation on November 21. It expects the solar farm to begin exporting in early December and to ramp up to full production by the end of March 2024.
“Achieving on-time energisation just one year after construction began is testament to the team’s detailed planning, coordination and great working relationship with AEMO,” Pacific Partnerships’ Managing Director Simon Nicholls said.
It may be slightly too early to begin celebrating though – just last week, the commissioning of stage two of Vena Energy’s 180 MW Tailem Bend solar farm in South Australia was completed. It took the project around nine months to go from energisation to complete commissioning.
Coming back to Glenrowan, the solar farm has a 10-year power purchase agreement in place with the Victorian government. Its site is around 245 hectares and is located in Victoria’s North East Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).
Cimic said the solar farm’s next milestone announcement will be its first round of $50,000 in benefit sharing funding to be allocated from the project’s community benefit program.

Rest’s Chief Investment Officer, Andrew Lill, says the company is aiming to provide strong long-term financial returns to its members via next-generation infrastructure in Australia and beyond.
Specifically, Rest is looking to “provide exposure” to assets like as solar and battery projects and green data storage centres, including Quinbrook’s Supernode green data campus in Brisbane – believed to be the largest in the southern hemisphere.
“In a world increasingly reliant on data, and through the global growth in cloud-based technologies and AI, data centres have become big business and demand for this critical infrastructure is expected to accelerate,” Lill said. “Repositories for the storage, management and dissemination of data require significant investments and huge amounts of energy.”
“Maximising their energy efficiency and minimising their environmental impact through our commitment to Quinbrook is just one way we believe we can contribute to strong long-term financial benefits for Rest members, while supporting our objective to achieve a net zero carbon footprint for the fund by 2050,” the Chief Investment Officer added.
Superannuation funds have emerged as some of the strongest investment vehicles for accelerating – or decelerating – the energy transition. In separate news, Origin shareholders have now cast their votes to decide on the company’s acquisition by Canadian giant Brookfield. 
Origin will hold a meeting on Thursday November 23 revealing its future. The acquisition has been loudly opposed by superfund and shareholder AustralianSuper, which has reportedly upped its stake in Origin to 17.5% over the last weeks in its campaign to block the deal. Brookfield’s takeover has hinged on a promise to invest more than $20 billion into transitioning Origin’s fleet to renewables.

It eventuated in six projects being selected to deliver a total of 1,075 MW of firmed capacity and 2,790 MWh of storage at a project value of $1.8 billion.
The six winning projects include:
All these projects are targeting commercial operations by December 2025 – the year the state’s biggest coal plant, the 2.88 GW Eraring, is currently scheduled to close. Its closure is set to open up a major energy supply and reliability gap in the state and was the focus of much attention earlier this year when the state’s new Labor government was elected and entertained the possibility of extending the plant’s life. NSW Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said specifically of these six projects that they will help ensure “we do not need [Eraring] to be open one day longer than they need.”

The successful projects are required to deliver at least half their capacity in the event of a supply shortfall declared by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). The projects from this tender alone are equal to 8% of the total 2022/23 NSW summer peak demand. They are underpinned by a 10-year agreement with government.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Minister Sharpe said part of the reason why the governments expect these projects to be able to be commercially operating within two years is because “they don’t rely on those very big transmission projects that we’re working with.” 
In the last years, shuttered power plants like Liddell have become extremely populate sites for battery proposals due to their infrastructure and grid connections.
The tender was run by AEMO Services, acting as the NSW Consumer Trustee. The auction originally sought 380 MW of firming infrastructure and demand response from the market but was expanded to 930 MW after the federal government came onboard to support an additional 550 MW through its own storage tender scheme, known as the Capacity Investment Scheme.

Few details of Enel X’s successful virtual power plant projects, or VPPs, has been included in the announcement. During her press conference, Minister Sharpe provided only an overview of the technology, which will aggregate distributed technologies like rooftop solar and battery systems to provide a total of 95 MW of capacity.
The three successful VPPs are part of Enel X’s Demand Response Project, which looks to create flexibility to respond to demand peaks and troughs in the grid. Enel X has been playing in the VPP space in Australia for quite some time and has a number of projects currently on the go.
Demand response is an interesting way to help manage the grid as it relies on using power differently (flexibly) rather than a more classic pathway of generating power, storing it and then dispatching it when required. The approach needs less infrastructure and technologies, but is inherently complex as it requires the orchestration of privately own assets like home batteries. 
“We need innovative thinking and new funding models to avoid the risk of blackouts,” Carl Hutchinson, Country Manager of Enel X Australia, said. “The result of this highly competitive tender proves that demand response is a cost-effective solution to meet this challenge. Using energy assets intelligently at key times keeps the lights on and rewards businesses.”
Akaysha Energy was acquired by US investment giant BlackRock in 2022. Since then, it has kicked goals in the NSW storage segment, awarded the contract to build the state’s 850 MW / 1,680 MWh Waratah Super Battery Project. The project is intended to act like a giant “shock absorber” and is underpinned by novel contracts with transmission company Transgrid and the state government’s EnergyCo. It too is being built at the site of a decommissioned coal-fired power station, Munmorah, near Doyalson north of Sydney.

The Orana BESS is the company’s second major storage goal – with the company noting it will be Australia’s first gigawatt-scale four-hour battery. “At Akaysha Energy, we are bullish on longer duration systems such as this four-hour system. Our in-house markets modelling, engineering and technical teams have all combined to provide us a strong view that four hours is the new normal for BESS duration in Australia,” Nick Carter, Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director at Akaysha Energy, said.
Alongside the Orana and Waratah big batteries, Akaysha is also developing the Elaine battery project in Victoria’s southwest. The project is set to have four hours of duration, with the company most recently saying the project would have 1,244 MWh of storage.

Enphase Energy is expanding to the commercial-scale market with its new IQ8P-3P commercial microinverters. They are designed for small-scale commercial installations. 
The US-based microinverter specialist said that the microinverters support up to 480 W of peak output power, suitable for three-phase commercial installations and high-powered solar panels, accommodating a range of panel types from 320 W to 640 W.
Enphase said its distributed architecture makes designing commercial rooftop applications more seamless, enabling flexibility in design for maximising yield on crowded or shaded small commercial rooftops. 
“We have been installing Enphase products for more than 13 years,” said Jason Szumlansky, owner of Florida Solar Design Group. “Enphase commercial microinverters are a game changer — simplifying installation, improving energy harvest, and satisfying client requirements. Our first project was successful and we found that commissioning a new Enphase commercial system is as simple as commissioning a residential installation.” 
The microinverters are backed by an industry leading 25-year warranty for projects in the United States and Canada and 12-year warranties for projects in Mexico. 
“If low-voltage power and module level rapid shutdown, production optimisation, and monitoring are a priority for a project, then the new commercial IQ8 Microinverters are an excellent solution,” said Jason Jackson, co-founder and chief executive officer, Hakai Energy Solutions.
The commercial Enphase system includes the IQ Gateway Commercial 2, an internet-connected portal that enables over-the-air updates and the ability to connect to the Enphase App production monitoring platform. Enphase Kiosk Software is provided to display system performance in real-time, offering marketing, brand value, and sustainability-tracking by showcasing on-site clean energy generation. The new microinverters also feature Enphase Burst Mode technology, allowing panels to start earlier and turn off later in the day where other systems would stop generating power.
Enphase said the commercial microinverters are available for distributor orders today, with shipments expected to begin by the end of 2023. Shipments are expected to begin from Enphase’s US contract manufacturing facilities in the first quarter of 2024.
