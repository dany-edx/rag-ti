During the conference, the company also announced an 8,000 cycle battery life for its products, which sits alongside the 10 year warranty. “While your warranty is 10 years, the life of the battery, if you are cycling once per day, is actually 21 years,” Redback’s Chief Technology Officer, Dr Adrian Knack told pv magazine Australia.

Coming back to Redback’s latest hybrid storage product, the DC-coupled, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery stacks from 9.6 kWh to 14.4 kWh.
Much emphasis has been placed on the latest model’s connectivity capabilities, making it suitable for dynamic connections and virtual power plants (VPPs), Knack said. At this stage, the battery integrates with VPPs from Energy Australia, Amber Electric and Pilco in Western Australia. “We are going to be bringing in more soon,” Knack added.

Ease of use and install has been a major focus for Redback too, Knack said. The new generation battery has differentiated compartments so homeowners can easily access all necessary switches, while the sections for installers or maintenance people sit elsewhere to avoid confusion.
Like many new residential batteries, Redback will have a target install time on its new hybrid model, but exactly what the target install time will be is not expected until early 2024.
The model is set to hit the Australian market in Q2, 2024, with Knack saying Redback will be offering “special” pricing for early customers, though details on the deal will again not be made public until next year.

Earlier this year, Redback pushed down its retail prices across a range of its batteries, offering discounts of between $500 and $1000. “We’re in a little but of a consumer recession,” Knack said, noting the cost cut not only related to improved lithium prices by sought to address the increasing cost of living in Australia.
With Australia and New Zealand the company’s two main markets, Knack also stressed Redback’s testing program. Redback has a test facility in Brisbane where it has been testing systems since its inception in 2015. It currently has 21 systems in full-time testing to assess endurance in various weather conditions as well as aspects like rusting for batteries in close proximity to the coast.
Redback introduced its first hybrid battery product to the Australian market in 2015, with over 50% of the company’s sale originating from hybrid products today. Knack added that Australia’s  storage market has picked up significantly in the last two years – a trend borne out by recent data.

AEMO Services, which is administering the tender process in its capacity as NSW Consumer Trustee, said while the latest tender will focus on new generation, it will also feature access rights, which provide successful projects with the right to connect to the grid in the state’s planned renewable energy zones.
The access rights are available for up to 5.8 GW of capacity in the Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), in the region surrounding Dubbo in the state’s northwest.
AEMO Services said projects located anywhere in NSW are eligible to participate in the fourth tender which will open on 31 October.
Projects can bid for only Long Term Energy Supply Agreements (LTESAs), that provide a minimum guaranteed price that helps reduce risk for investors, or a combination of LTESAs and access if located in the Central-West Orana REZ.
The tender is the latest in a 10-year program which will see tenders held approximately every six months as part of NSW realising its ambitious Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap.
This fourth Roadmap tender follows the first tender, which concluded in May, with three generation projects contracted at a total capacity of 1,395 MW, and one long-duration storage battery project.
Successful proponents from the second tender, for firming infrastructure, and third tender, for both generation and long-duration storage, are expected to be announced by the end of the year.

MPower Chief Executive Officer Nathan Wise said the agreement with Trina covers the first five mid-scale solar farms which form part of the company’s planned wider rollout of grid-connected renewable energy assets with total capacity of more than 200 MW.
“With this partnership, MPower can accelerate the rollout of its build-own-operate strategy with best-in-class components and technology, and build additional traction in what is shaping up as a multi-billion dollar addressable market opportunity,” Wise said.
Under the agreement, Trina has agreed to supply an initial 39.5 MWp of solar modules and 31.2 MWp of TrinaTracker Vanguard 1P trackers before the end of 2024.
The modules are the large format Vertex N bifacial module with iTOPCon (NEG21C.20) and the Vertex bifacial module (DEG21C.20).
Andrew Gilhooly, Trina’s head of utility solutions and storage for Asia Pacific, said the MPower agreement is the first MSA in Australia to include both panels and trackers, and will give the developer greater certainty over product supply and pricing.
“The innovative contract structure under this arrangement enables MPower to navigate pricing uncertainty on modules and trackers with confidence over a prolonged implementation timescale, where individual project characteristics on the entire portfolio of sites may initially be unknown or uncertain,” he said.
“For the sub-5 MW segment in Australia this is important, as it enables them to scale quickly and successfully execute more projects within a more expedient timeframe.”
MPower has already started construction on a 5 MW solar farm in Narromine in central New South Wales, the first of the mid-scale projects the company intends to build across the grid.
Other projects in MPower’s development pipeline include a shovel-ready 5 MW solar project at Faraday in Victoria and a ready-to-build 5 MW solar farm with a 5 MW/10 MWh battery storage project at Kadina in South Australia.

The Innoptus, which features a PV panel with 257 standard-sized interdigitated back contact solar cells, set the pace in the Challenge Class from the outset, reaching speeds of more than 100kph.
The Belgian’s aerodynamic Infinite, with a fin designed for stability, seemed to revel in the windy conditions that proved tough for many in the event.
Innoptus crossed ahead of the Netherlands’ Team Twente RED X which finished with a time of 34 hours, 24 minutes, 58 seconds. Dutch team Brunel in Nuna 12 arrived in Adelaide around two hours later, to take third place.
German team Sonnenwagen in Covestro Adelie were in fourth place before being forced to retire after a crash south of Port Augusta. The team said the driver lost control of the vehicle after a road trains had passed.
In the Cruiser Class, that demands production-style vehicles capable of transporting multiple passengers, the unseasonal headwinds caused havoc with none of the teams able to complete the 1,000km second stage, the first time this has happened in the history of the class.
Half the field had made the first time point, driving nearly 1,000km before charging, but they were unable to complete the second stage.
At the end of the first stage Australia’s Sunswift, in Sunswift 7, was leading the field.
The Cruiser teams are expected to complete the final stage today before presenting for practicality judging on Saturday. The on-road scoring component will be calculated from the last completed stage.
This is the first timethe Challenge has been staged since 2019 with the 2021 event cancelled due to the complexities presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/27/climate-jobs-campaign-warns-skills-shortage-threatens-energy-transition/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 27, 2023",Climate jobs campaign warns skills shortage threatens energy transition,"Careers for Net Zero, a joint campaign led by the Clean Energy Council (CEC) and the Energy Efficiency Council (EEC), has warned that Australia must urgently upskill its workforce to achieve its clean energy ambitions and realise its potential as a renewable energy superpower.
Globally, it’s estimated the renewable energy transition will create 14 million new clean energy jobs by 2030, while another 16 million workers will need to move into new roles in renewables, energy efficiency and electrification.
In Australia, the recent Jobs and Skills report estimates 200,000 new roles are required to meet the federal government’s 2030 target of 82% renewables in the grid, while modelling suggests at least two million new jobs are required to meet net zero emissions by 2050.
EEC Chief Executive Officer Luke Menzel said the Careers for Net Zero campaign, which is backed by Boundless Earth, a philanthropic venture backed and chaired by Atlassian co-founder Cannon-Brookes, has been designed to entice more Australians to consider switching their careers to one in the clean economy sector.
“Immediate action is needed,” he said. “The current talent pool simply isn’t matching up with demand, and many of the roles desperately needed by 2030 already face major skill shortages at a national level.”
“If we fall short of meeting these targets, it will come at a huge cost.”
Kane Thornton, chief executive of the CEC, said global competition for talent across a diverse range of skills and occupations means filling Australia’s skills gap and encourage job seekers to pursue a clean economy career is a top priority for the sector.
“Upskilling needs to occur on a colossal scale,” he said. “We need to double our energy workforce by 2030 and double it again by 2035.”
The new campaign includes an online ‘career explorer’ tool available through the Careers for Net Zero website.
The online platform provides the growing list of careers needed for Australia to reach net zero, highlights the most in-demand jobs, and explains what students, graduates and experienced workers need to do to obtain those roles.
The new campaign announcement coincided with the launch in Australia of clean energy jobs board Terra.do, with about 4,500 clean energy jobs available locally.
Anshuman Bapna, chief executive and co-founder of the online platform, said he is aiming to shift 100,000 Australian workers into clean economy roles by 2027.
“Australia is a relatively small economy but potentially a very big deal for the global climate transition – from critical minerals to hydrogen derivatives,” he said. “But it’ll take a massive mobilisation of talent.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/27/spain-rockets-to-fourth-in-global-utility-scale-solar-listing/,"MARKETS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,SPAIN",ANGELA SKUJINS,"OCTOBER 27, 2023",Spain rockets to fourth in global utility-scale solar listing,"Wiki-Solar, an online solar database, published a list of the world’s top 19 utility-scale solar developers this week. The data, which compiles project developers’ total global output as of the third quarter of 2023, shows that a growing number of projects are being built in Spain.
“The recent pace of deployment in Spain is sensational,” Wiki-Solar founder Philip Wolfe said. “This is almost entirely unsubsidized projects – showing how competitive solar has become.”
There are 546 solar plants operating in Spain, producing roughly 20.8 GW of energy as of the third quarter, according to Wiki-Solar. Major project developers operating in the Mediterranean country include Enel Green Power, run by Spanish utility Endesa, as well as independent power producers such as X-Elio and Naturgy.
According to Wiki-Solar, this means that Spain is closely following PV’s three big international players – China, the United States and India, with project developers reaping the rewards.
“Spain held [the] top position in the world between 2007 and 2011 on the back of its generous feed-in tariff scheme,” the report said. “When this was controversially dismantled, the country slid down the table to No. 7 in 2017-18. It is now back up to No. 4 with a lot of clear water ahead of the chasing pack led by Germany.”
Wiki-Solar acknowledges that there will be “some omissions” from the top 19 developer listings. This is because the website’s database only records roughly 88% of projects. It said that its figures could be understated by an average factor of 1.1.
