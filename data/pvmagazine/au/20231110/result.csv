Genex said the project is now able to operate at its full 50 MW capacity but will initially operate with only 38 of its 40 Megapack units, with battery technology supplier Tesla due to replace two modules by early December after fire broke out at the facility in September.
The fire, since found to have occurred at the grid side of the battery unit, damaged one Megapack unit while a neighbouring module that could have been impacted by the heat of the fire is also being replaced. The units have already been shipped and are expected to arrive and complete installation and commissioning in early December 2023.
Genex Chief Executive Officer Craig Francis said while the fire had caused a minor delay, the project has been completed within budget.
“The completion of construction and commencement of operations at our 50 MW/100 MWh Bouldercombe Battery Project is an exciting milestone for Genex,” he said.
“Bouldercombe is our first battery energy storage project and after the fire event in late September, delivering it with only a modest delay and within budget is a fantastic outcome for Genex and its partners.”
The battery is to be operated by Tesla with Genex saying that full operational dispatch rights of the battery can now be handed over as part of a long-term offtake agreement that includes a revenue sharing arrangement.
Tesla will use its Autobidder algorithm technology to optimise the battery’s performance and “maximise revenues across the arbitrage and frequency control” services.
Francis said the timing for commencement of full operations for the project could not be better, coinciding with the new Fast Frequency Response ancillary services market which commenced last month and a looming El Nino summer which is expected to place significant stress on the electricity network.
“The commencement of operations will mark the next step-change in revenues and cash flows for Genex, and we are also extremely pleased that Bouldercombe will be able to play its part in supporting the Queensland energy system over this period,” he said.
Bouldercombe is Genex’s first battery investment. The developer is also building the 250 MW/2,000 MWh Kidston Pumped Hydro Project in north Queensland, and operates the nearby 50 MW Kidston Solar Farm and the 50 MW Jemalong Solar Farm in New South Wales.
The Bouldercombe battery is the second big battery to be switched on in the Queensland grid, after Singapore-based developer Vena Energy flicked the switch on the 100 MW/150 MWh Wandoan South battery in the state’s south-west in August 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/10/feasibility-first-value-selling-a-turbocharger-for-commercial-installer-growth/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",,"NOVEMBER 10, 2023",Feasibility-first value selling – a turbocharger for commercial installer growth,"Is the traditional sales approach working for solar and battery installers, or could there be a better way?
In this article, I will explore the concept of ‘Feasibility First Value Selling’ and how it can be adopted to transform your sales process. If you’re not currently closing at least 80% of the proposals you send to businesses buying solar and batteries, this method could be a game changer for your company.
You’re probably thinking, “not possible,” right? I challenge you that it is possible and that some leading solar sellers already claim this. With the right tools and approach, it is absolutely possible to achieve sales that are less lumpy and with net profit margins increased from a typical industry average of around 2% to well over 5%.
In this article, we will explore:
Solar companies commonly start as a couple of people with a truck, operating from their kitchen table and selling residential and small business solar systems as fast as they can screw them to a roof. Some of the biggest and best solar companies started like this including Gippsland Solar (acquired by RACV) and GEM Energy (acquired by RACQ).
As solar companies grow, they develop business processes and implement systems to streamline their operations. Solar sales software is commonly implemented to enable a solar business to efficiently and quickly design and price residential solar solutions. Unfortunately though, this has had the effect of locking in a “traditional sales” approach applied to all project sizes.
The traditional sales approach typically involves the following steps:

Figure 1 – Traditional sales approach used by solar installers
There are several problems with this approach:
As they grow, many solar installers take on more ambitious opportunities, selling increasingly larger systems to business customers. Many solar installers continue to employ these traditional sales approaches. These problems don’t go away, they get worse. The bigger the systems and the larger the clients, the more opportunity risk there is and therefore more time is needed to develop a proposal and the more wasted effort if the opportunity is not won.
When selling to businesses, solar installers also run into a new challenge – they start selling to individuals that are looking for a return on their investment.
A new approach: feasibility-first value selling
Feasibility-first is intended to flip the typical sales process, bringing forward the financial feasibility of projects that ultimately determine whether the project proceeds, and reserving more expensive engineering resources until the deal has a much higher chance of being closed.
The key principles behind this approach are as follows:
In summary, this consultative selling approach builds trust with the customer and identifies the solution that best meets the customers drivers, importantly without wasting any engineering effort. 

Figure 2 – An example of creating the “the why” in technology selection using Orkestra. Here we determined that a 600kW north-facing solar solution is optimal for this a manufacturing site as it generates the best Net Present Value (determined on a 15-year pre-tax basis).
The feasibility first sales approach is as follows:
This is where you need to stop. This is where we recommend forcing a go/no-go decision by the customer. Here we’d suggest trying to obtain a period of exclusivity or go as far as signing a contract where the customer pays for the engineering and design of a solution if they don’t proceed with your solution. This is easier said than done, but should definitely be the aspiration of all solar companies. It does not make sense that customers force the detailed design of a solar system by multiple installers.
Steps 4 – 7 for the feasibility-first sales approach then follow the same steps as the traditional sales – site assessment, technical design, proposal generation, negotiation and close. The difference is that the engineers have clear direction on what solution will meet the customers drivers and that the high cost resources are only deployed with confirmed/higher likelihood of sale.

Figure 3 – The feasibility-first sales approach
Sounds great – but is it possible to implement?
Yes, because technology is changing the game.
Feasibility value selling is not a new concept, but for a long time it has been just out of reach for most solar installers as it generally requires expensive engineering and analytical resources. The top solar companies in the country developed their own tools, typically built on Excel Spreadsheets. The problem with these solutions is that they are fragile and difficult for anyone but the original developer to use, making these tools unscalable.
Excel also suffers from a few other issues you may have experienced yourself:
This is where technology comes in, as a critical enabler for supporting faster, more accurate analysis and reporting. Feasibility modelling software solutions like Orkestra are solving all these problems (and more), finally enabling feasibility-first value selling to be undertaken by all solar installers, not just the “big guys” that can afford the best analysts.
Using feasibility modelling software, a solar and battery sales person or analyst can whip through hundreds of technology combinations and site adjustments like tariff changes in minutes. This process not only identifies the solution that best meets a customer’s drivers, but creates the rationale (i.e “the why”) for why it is the best solution and other options are not.
Feasibility-first value selling can be used to increase net margins
Organisations that embrace feasibility modelling software and feasibility-first value selling will discover they can:
Most solar installers run on wafer thin margins, typically taking home a net profit margin of just 2% – 3%. We estimated all the benefits of feasibility-first selling and value selling, determining that it is possible to increase net profit margins to over 5%.
How do I start?
Your primary task is to empower your sales team to do easy, fast and accurate feasibility analysis. This requires you to:
If you invest in your sales teams like this, you’ll be enabling a game changing new sales strategy for your business.
Feasibility-first value sales can be a powerful growth and profit enabler for any solar and battery installer selling to business customers. Through this strategy, solar installers can increase their net margins by up to 177%.
All together, data-driven, feasibility-first value sales will lead to lower cost of sales, greater sales conversions, higher capacity, faster processing times, better project scoping and ultimately greater business success.

The parties will assess the technical, economic and environmental aspects of converting CEVJ’s existing coal mines into energy storage facilities, using Green Gravity’s energy storage solution which moves heavy weights vertically in legacy mine shafts to capture and release the gravitational potential energy, providing long-duration storage to the grid.
The two companies will also evaluate the potential benefits and challenges of integrating the energy storage system with the existing power grid and renewable energy sources.
Green Gravity Chief Executive Officer Mark Swinnerton said the agreement underpins the export potential of clean energy technology from Australia and places the company at the forefront of commercialising gravitational energy storage globally.
“Our technology offers a unique solution to store excess renewable energy using gravity, which can help balance the power grid and support the EU’s climate goals,” he said.
“Successfully implementing gravitational energy storage in the Valea Jiului will provide a leading example for successful transition of a coal mining region. This project has global implications for climate, jobs and investment.”
Green Gravity’s technology harnesses the fundamental principles of gravity and kinetic energy to generate clean, dispatchable energy. The system relies on lifting and lowering ultra-heavy weights in legacy mine shafts and in doing so, turning a turbine that creates electricity.
Swinnerton said the technology “represents a breakthrough in the search for economic long-duration storage of renewable energy.”
“By re-using mining assets, costs can be kept low,” he said. “By using gravity as the fuel, we dispense with consuming the critical water, land, and chemicals which other storage technologies rely on.”

Green Gravity, based at Wollongong on the New South Wales South Coast, has already struck early-stage collaboration deals with the likes of Australian coal producer Yancoal and international engineering heavyweight GHD.
CEVJ Managing Director Eusebiu Durbaca said in a statement that the collaboration with Green Gravity has the potential to transform Romania’s coal sector into a renewable energy storage hub as the country shifts from fossil fuels to renewables.
Romania is aiming to increase the share of renewable energy in its energy mix and reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, targeting 30.5% renewables by 2030 and committing to phasing out coal by 2032.
“This project is part of our strategy to diversify our energy portfolio and explore new opportunities for value creation from our coal assets,” Durbaca said. “We believe that gravitational energy storage is an innovative approach to energy transition, and we are committed to contributing to Romania’s and Europe’s energy transition and green recovery.”

The purchases include the 11 MW Williamsdale Solar Farm and the 2.3 MW Mount Majura Solar Farm in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), and the 1 MW Karratha Solar Farm in Western Australia.
The Williamsdale and Mount Majura solar farms are backed by a long-term offtake agreement with the ACT government, while the output of the Karratha solar plant is contracted under a long-term agreement with the local council.
The deal, reported by the Australian Financial Review to be worth between $30 million (USD 19.1 million) and $40 million, marks further growth of Sydney-based CleanPeak’s growing ground-mounted solar portfolio.
Earlier this year it acquired the 13 MW Mugga Lane Solar Park near Canberra and only last week announced it had broken ground on the 30 MW (40 MWp) Wangaratta Solar Farm project being developed in northeast Victoria. In addition to the solar asset, the Wangaratta project also includes scope for a 15 MWh battery energy storage system.
The solar farms add to CleanPeak’s portfolio of C&I energy projects which include more than 50 MW of rooftop solar and 35 MWh of battery energy storage either in operation or under development.
Among those assets are a 5 MW PV system at the Tonsley Innovation District in Adelaide, a combined 5.4 MW of rooftop solar atop biscuit manufacturer Arnott’s two biggest Australian production facilities, and a suite of embedded network projects at shopping centres throughout Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/10/solar-plus-storage-outperforms-diesel-in-us-military-survival-analysis/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"NOVEMBER 10, 2023",Solar-plus-storage outperforms diesel in US military survival analysis,"From pv magazine USA
Analysis by NREL shows that solar energy systems, when paired with 14-day long duration energy storage (LDES), can outperform military-grade emergency diesel generators (EDGs) in both survivability and financial viability for military applications.
Historical statistics comparing the failure rates of EDGs to solar plus LDES technologies demonstrate that, over a 14-day standard military uptime evaluation, solar plus LDES’ survivability probability exceeds 95%, while the diesel generators’ survivability hovers around 80%.

The study also suggests that a more strategically sized solar-plus-storage system could achieve nearly perfect reliability, with uptime approaching 100% over a two-week period. NREL differentiates between the 95%+ ‘Intermediate’ battery energy storage system (BESS), which is currently available for field testing and provides a 38% round-trip efficiency, while the 100% ‘Goal’ BESS, still in the conceptual phase, is expected to provide a 48% round-trip efficiency and cut the energy storage system costs in half. However, since the ‘Goal’ BESS is currently under development, future costs may deviate from these projections.
The analysis also found that the Intermediate solar-plus-storage projects had a positive net present value, meaning that they paid for themselves over the long term. The same could not be said for the EDGs. The theoretical Goal BESS sized projects with 100% uptime over the 14-day window were projected to have a net present value positive over their lifetimes.
