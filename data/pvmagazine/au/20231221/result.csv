The 2023-24 GenCost draft report, an annual collaboration between the CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), shows that new build costs across the board have generally stabilised since the 20% increase reported last year, albeit with some outliers.
The cost of large-scale PV generation fell by 8%, while onshore wind rose by the same proportion. Battery costs were steady, rising only 2%, offshore wind decreased by 9%, and the cost of gas turbine technologies increased by 14%.
Costs for technologies such as pumped hydro, wave and tidal energy increased after not been updated in more than a year, reflecting a combination of new information and inflationary pressures.
Nuclear small modular reactors (SMRs) emerged as the highest-cost technology explored in the report with the CSIRO suggesting it will take another 15 years before the first one could be built.
The report reveals that utility-scale solar and onshore wind costs, including transmission and storage, are two to seven times cheaper than new coal and small modular nuclear reactors.

The CSIRO said the drafting considers inputs sourced on real-time engineering and construction cost data points in Australia, as well as overseas parallels, information from equipment manufacturers, software and literature.
The new report also incorporates pre-2030 integration costs, such as storage and transmission for variable renewables in the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) data. This addresses the concern that leaving out pre-2030 projects under-estimates the cost of the renewable transition.
While the change has led to higher cost estimates, variable renewables were still found to have the lowest cost range of any new-build technology.
Australian Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the report reaffirms that “renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy in Australia now and in 2030, even when accounting for storage and transmission costs.”
“Its conclusions this year are unimpeachable and very, very clear,” he said. “The cheapest form of energy is renewable energy, even including the costs that go with renewable energy around storage and transmission. Even including those costs, it’s very, very clear renewable energy is the cheapest.”
CSIRO Director of Energy Dietmar Tourbier said the report is one of several economic analysis documents designed to help the Australian energy market plan for future electricity generation, with technology costs a crucial piece of the larger puzzle.
“GenCost uses the best available data in each cycle to provide important insights into our electricity market that are unbiased and up to date,” he said. “As we work to reduce our emissions, GenCost plays a pivotal role in guiding decision-makers to plan and build reliable, low-cost energy solutions that will help power the future of Australia.”
The draft report is open for consultation until 9 February 2024 with the final GenCost 2023-24 report expected to be released in the second quarter of 2024.

The $8 million (USD 5.39 million) microgrid, jointly funded by Endeavour and the state and federal government-backed Bushfire Local Economic Recovery (BLER) Fund, will act as a self-contained energy system, harnessing electricity from about 2 MW of residential solar and 430 kW/1.2 MWh of subsidised residential batteries installed in about 100 homes in the two communities, along with the 3 MW grid-connected battery. This configuration empowers the microgrid to operate autonomously during outages, forming an island of power for the community.
The microgrid replaces an existing 1 MW diesel-fuelled generator and connects to the main electricity grid, and is strategically sited to provide a reliable and secure power supply for the two towns that are frequently required to deal with power outages.
“These two towns, like many other rural and regional communities across Australia are vulnerable to catastrophic weather events,” Endeavour Chief Executive Officer Guy Chalkley said. “The grid independence provided by this community microgrid becomes essential for safeguarding our regional communities.”
Chalkley emphasised the microgrid’s role in empowering the coastal towns during bushfires, storms, and peak periods.
“The community microgrid will mean that shops such as the local supermarket can stay open and life can continue rather than coming to a halt every time there is an outage,” he said.
“This is a first for NSW, and once proven successful, will become a benchmark for similar towns across the state.”
Local leaders, including NSW Member for the South Coast and Bawley Point resident Liza Butler, have hailed the project’s impact.
Butler, who experienced the bushfires that ravaged the region in 2019/2020 said that “when the power goes out, we can’t carry out the basics such as boil water, flush the toilet, and in times of emergency, we also lose telecommunications and our water source.”
Endeavour, which has a network spanning 25,000 square kilometres and incorporating 250,000 residential solar connections, said the Bawley Point and Kiola initiative is not just a standalone project, but rather a blueprint for the future.
Endeavour said it is already exploring other locations that can benefit from similar installations, underscoring the potential for this model to be replicated across Australia.

The six shortlisted projects are spread throughout Queensland, New South Wales (NSW), Tasmania and Western Australia and represent a total electrolyser capacity of more than 3.5 GW across various end uses, predominantly in hard-to-abate sectors such as ammonia.
The successful projects include the Murchison Hydrogen Renewables Project that will feature at least 1,625 MW of electrolyser capacity and bp’s H2Kwinana project that is to include a 105 MW electrolyser, both in Western Australia.
In NSW, Korea Electric Power Corporation’s (KEPCO) planned Port of Newcastle Green Hydrogen Project that includes 750 MW of electrolyser capacity has been shortlisted, along with Origin Energy’s Hunter Valley Hydrogen Hub that is to include a 50 MW electrolyser in the first phase, with the potential to expand to 200 MW in subsequent phases.
Chile’s HIF (Highly Innovative Fuels) Global’s planned Tasmania eFuel Facility that includes a 144 MW electrolyser has also advanced to the next stage, along with the Central Queensland Hydrogen Project that comprises at least 720 MW of electrolyser capacity being developed by Queensland government-owned generator Stanwell Energy.

ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said the shortlisted projects involve deploying large-scale electrolysers of at least 50 MW in size, making a significant and faster impact on implementing a new renewable hydrogen industry.
“The applicants shortlisted for the next stage provide us with the best opportunity at fast tracking our renewable hydrogen industry,” he said. “It’s great to see the commitment from Australian companies who are looking to invest in and utilise hydrogen in their own decarbonisation efforts.”
Miller said the Hydrogen Headstart program is “a crucial step towards keeping Australia on the path to become a global hydrogen leader, creating new export opportunities, while helping to decarbonise our economy.”
Announced in the 2023-24 budget, the Hydrogen Headstart program aims to catalyse Australia’s green hydrogen industry. Under the program, projects seeking to produce green hydrogen or derivatives, such as renewable ammonia or methanol, at scale can apply for a production credit delivered over 10 years to bridge the commercial gap between the cost of producing renewable hydrogen and the market price.
Federal Energy Minister said large-scale production of renewable hydrogen is critical to Australia becoming a global hydrogen leader and the broad spread of shortlisted projects – which he described as amongst the largest renewable hydrogen projects in the world – reflects the opportunities available in Australia.
“We have the largest pipeline of renewable hydrogen projects in the world – Hydrogen Headstart is about supporting these projects to become a reality, as Australia transforms into a renewable energy superpower,” he said.
“Renewable hydrogen is crucial to reach net zero, while creating economic opportunities for regional Australia.”
Shortlisted applicants have until 27 June 2024 to submit their full application with funding recipients expected to be announced in the second half of 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/21/regulator-provides-tick-of-approval-for-marinus-link-early-works-spend/,"FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,TASMANIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 21, 2023",Regulator provides tick of approval for Marinus Link early works spend,"The Australian Energy Regulator (AER) has published a determination approving early works expenditure, or revenue determination, enabling Marinus Link to recover the costs for designing and planning the multi-billion-dollar project through to a final investment decision.
The determination approves proposed capital expenditure of $196.5 million (USD 132 million) for early works, including technical design and specifications, project management, environmental impact assessments, community and landowner engagement and procurement strategy and execution.
Marinus Link is a proposed 1,500 MW transmission line between Tasmania and Victoria. The project originally comprised two 750 MW high voltage direct current (HVDC) cables running 255 kilometres undersea and 90 km underground between Burnie, Tasmania and Latrobe Valley, Victoria.
Soaring project costs have however prompted a rethink with the project to now prioritise the delivery of just one 750 MW cable in the first instance at an estimated cost of $3.3 billon, with negotiations to continue on a second cable.
The AER said Marinus Link has proposed $196.5 million in forecast expenditure for early works activities, partially covered by grant funding, with the remainder, $128.9 million, subject to the revenue application.
In its determination, the regulator said it had examined Marinus Link’s proposed capex forecast and considers “the amount proposed is reasonable, prudent and efficient” to deliver early works for the project.
Marinus Link Chief Executive Officer Caroline Wykamp welcomed the determination, saying it has given the green light to make Marinus Link a reality.
“The revenue determination guarantees the project can only recover costs in line with customers’ best interests,” she said.
“Today’s determination shows that Marinus Link is not spending more than what is necessary to plan the project.”

Marinus Link will later submit an application seeking to recover revenue for project construction and implementation costs once the project has been committed to, passed the Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) feedback loop process and a final cost estimate is available.
The AER said this staged approach has been adopted to “reduce project uncertainty and identify project risks before committing to the full project.”
The project has been classified as a priority investment and ‘actionable’ in AEMO’s Draft 2024 Integrated System Plan (ISP), which maps the optimal path for transmission developments in the National Electricity Market (NEM). The ISP recommends commencing operation of cable one in 2029 and cable two in 2031.
To meet these recommended timeframes, Marinus Link said construction must commence in 2025. Marinus Link is working towards a final investment decision on the project by the end of 2024.
Marinus Link has forecast that the first stage of the project will contribute $1.4 billion of economic stimulus to Tasmania and $1 billion to Victoria and support 1,400 direct and indirect jobs per year in Tasmania during peak construction, and 1,000 direct and indirect jobs per year in Victoria during the same time period.

Frontier is developing the Bristol Springs Renewable Energy Project with development approvals for a total solar generation capacity of 355 MW while Waroona has been developing the namesake 241 MW solar project on the adjacent property, about 120 kilometres south of state capital Perth.
The two companies will now be joining forces to drive their multiple value-adding initiatives forward with new chief executive and chief operations officers appointed for the newly combined company to support further development. This includes a spate of studies that are to be finalised in early 2024, including green hydrogen production, hydrogen consumption in a peaking power plant, and utility-scale battery storage.
In announcing the acquisition, Frontier said that the combined projects hold significant renewable energy expansion potential, with the company now controlling two grid connections capable of exporting more than 1 GW of renewable energy to the grid. Frontier also has freehold landholding of 868 hectares, which it said is ideal for solar, hydrogen and other renewable energy opportunities.

Frontier released a definitive feasibility study on its Bristol Springs Hydrogen Project in March 2023, highlighting the project’s potential to be one of the lowest-cost green hydrogen projects in Australia.
For its part, Waroona said in a company analysis and management document that it has already commenced a study to assess a minimum 100 MW hydrogen-fuelled (dual fuel) peaking power facility at its Waroona Solar Energy Project. This study will now be completed with the assistance of Frontier under their existing collaboration agreements made prior to the takeover.
Dual fuel peaking plants are designed to balance the fluctuating power requirement in the electricity network and operate during periods of high-level demand for electricity or shortfalls of electricity supply. The planned peaking plant is to be fuelled by renewable hydrogen produced from the solar energy generated at the Waroona Solar Energy Project and/or Frontier’s Bristol Springs Renewable Energy Project. This will be backed up by gas sourced from suppliers and transported via the Dampier to Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline.
With the takeover of Waroona Energy, Frontier is restructuring its senior management team to focus on project execution ahead of planned final investment decision for its 120 MWdc solar farm. The former CEO of Waroona Energy, Adam Kiley, will now become CEO of Frontier Energy on account of his 20 years of experience in equity capital markets and debt financing sectors.
The technical and engineering aspect of the multidisciplinary project will be led by Warrren King as COO. King is an engineer with 25 years of experience, specialising in project management of engineering, design, procurement and construction.
Executive Chair Grant Davey explained: “As we advance towards a development decision in 1H2024, which includes the delivery of final development studies, both equity and debt financing, procurement and project execution, the Board decided it was the right time to realign and strengthen the senior management team to focus on project financing and development execution.”
Incoming CEO Adam Kiley described the challenges the newly combined company can address: rising energy prices with rising demand and limited new generation capacity entering the market due to grid constraints.
The area is part of the Collie and Kwinana industrial precincts, home to the Griffin coal plant which was only just kept alive with a boost of $220 million (USD 146 million) from the state government.
“I believe the opportunity at Bristol Springs is one of Australia’s best undeveloped renewable energy projects, and it has a tremendous head start given the vast infrastructure already in place,” Kiley said.
“This should not only result in strong financial returns, which will be highlighted in a number of upcoming studies, but will also contribute to providing security for WA’s energy requirements through this energy transition.”
Frontier said it remains fully funded until FID for Stage One.
Frontier, formerly Superior Lake Resources, and Waroona Energy, formerly Metallum Resources, were both formerly primarily engaged in mineral resource industries until recently. Waroona still has a zinc project in Canada. Both companies recognised significant growth opportunities in renewable energy, particularly in decarbonising mineral extraction and refining industries, such as the nearby aluminium mining activities in the area of their Bristol Lake/Waroona solar and renewable hydrogen projects.
The Frontier Energy renewable energy hub will be in good company for upcoming renewable energy projects. In September 2023, the Western Australian government awarded contracts for its 500 MW/2,000 MWh big battery in Collie and the 200 MW/800 MWh extension to the existing Kwinana battery. Another large renewable energy project for the production of green hydrogen is currently being put through a feasibility study, which was announced in April 2022. In May this year, Perth-based company International Graphite selected the preferred site for its proposed Collie graphite battery anode material (BAM) manufacturing facility. This company plans to deliver a feasibility study for the facility in the third quarter of 2024.

A group of researchers led by China’s State Grid Smart Grid Research Institute has developed a plant control system for modular gravity energy storage (M-GES).
“Our work represents the first attempt at creating an energy control strategy with excellent performance for M-GES power plants,” the research’s lead author, Wenxuan Tong, told pv magazine. “We proposed and validated for the first time the maximum height difference control. A detailed mathematical model of the energy management system of the M-GES plant is also presented for the first time.”
M-GES differentiates from monolithic GES as it uses several standardised blocks instead of a single giant block. According to the researchers, utilising modular weights offers more flexibility in output power, ease of mass production of related equipment and better flexibility in the selection of weights.
“Currently, most of the studies in the field of M-GES are focused on the proposal of new technology routes and preliminary verification of technical feasibility,” the researchers explained. “However, the M-GES plants need further study of its control technology to apply in the actual power grid with its role as a grid power regulator.”
In the study “Energy management system for modular-gravity energy storage plant,” published in the Journal of Energy Storage, the research team explained that the management system consists of three different parts: the monitoring prediction system (MPS); the energy management system (EMS); and the power control system (PCS). The three parts communicate with each other through the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system.
The MPS performs real-time grid status monitoring and receives inputs from the dispatch center based on the grid status. It is responsible for optimal interaction between the M-GES plant and the grid. The PCS is responsible for power balancing and coordinating the operation of the units in the M-GES plant.
The EMS coordinates the operation of the different blocks of the GES plant. “The EMS of an M-GES plant will be more complex than the GES plant based on independent blocks because of the involvement of coordinated control between multiple blocks,” said the academics.
The EMS also reportedly addresses one of the main hurdles that module gravity storage needs to deal with, which is its state-of-charge (SOC). The SOC is the amount of energy stored in an energy storage system relative to its full capacity. To solve this issue, the research team adopted a SOC model and a maximum height difference (MHC) energy control strategy.
“Losses are generated whenever the unit is switched on and off, including the inherent losses during start-up and stop, the overall operating efficiency of the unit can be improved if the stable operating time of the unit can be extended,” the scientists explained.” Adopting an energy control strategy with a longer unit operating cycle is appropriate from the unit’s perspective.”
The researchers validated their approach on the MATLAB/Simulink platform and found the MHC improves power stability and efficiency of an M-GES plant by keeping the SOC above half, with this advantage becoming more relevant as the SOC increases.
“The proposed energy management system performs well in natural power systems,” Tong said.

Chinese solar module manufacturer Longi has achieved a power conversion efficiency of 27.09% for a heterojunction back contact (HBC) solar cell. Germany’s Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH) has confirmed the result.
Longi said the result was enabled through a new laser graphical process that costs less than conventional high-cost photolithography processes.
“This substitution has effectively reduced the cost of the BC cell,” the company said in a statement, noting that the HBC architecture also minimises the reliance on traditional indium-based transparent conductive oxide (ITO). “This breakthrough has propelled the commercialisation of HBC solar cells, featuring independent intellectual property and cost-effectiveness.”
In early November, Longi announced a power conversion efficiency of 33.9% for a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell.
It claimed the world’s highest efficiency for silicon cells in November 2022, with a 26.81% efficiency rating for an unspecified heterojunction solar cell.
