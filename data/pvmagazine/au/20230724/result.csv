This article explores how AD impacts sustainability, including its role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution prevention, advancements in digesting wood waste, as well as the versatile applications of biogas.
Organic waste that decomposes in landfills produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas with 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. By diverting organic waste to AD facilities, methane emissions are significantly reduced.
Capturing and utilising the methane produced during the AD process prevents it from being released into the atmosphere. Methane capture not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also harnesses the energy potential of biogas for various applications, including electricity generation, heat production, and as a vehicle fuel.
In addition to methane, AD also mitigates the production of nitrous oxide (N2O), another potent greenhouse gas. When organic waste decomposes under aerobic conditions, it can lead to the release of N2O, particularly in the case of nitrogen-rich waste, such as sewage sludge. AD, which operates in an oxygen-free environment, prevents the formation and release of N2O, reducing the overall greenhouse gas emissions associated with waste treatment. The proximity of AD facilities to the source of feedstocks offers an additional advantage by minimising the emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulphur oxide (SOx) gases. By locating anaerobic digestion facilities near the feedstock origin, the levels of N2O and SOx emissions are further diminished, contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable operation.
The cumulative effect of these mechanisms demonstrates the significant contribution of AD technology in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By effectively capturing methane, diverting organic waste from landfills, enhancing carbon sequestration, reducing fossil fuel consumption, and avoiding N2O emissions, anaerobic digestion technology plays a vital role in mitigating climate change and promoting a more sustainable environment.
AD technologies embody the principles of the circular economy by creating a closed-loop waste management system. AD facilities provide an efficient and sustainable alternative to traditional waste disposal methods, such as landfilling or incineration.
By converting organic waste into valuable resources, AD facilities promote waste diversion, reducing the burden on landfills and incinerators. The residue left after the digestion process can be used as a natural soil amendment, completing the nutrient cycle.
AD facilities deal with a substantial amount of organic material, which often retains a certain level of liquidity. If not handled properly, this organic liquid waste can pose significant challenges and contribute to water pollution. Therefore, proper management and treatment of the liquid byproducts from AD facilities are crucial to prevent any potential contamination of water bodies. Implementing effective separation and treatment techniques ensures that the liquid waste is processed responsibly, reducing the risk of water pollution and supporting overall sustainability efforts.
AD plays a crucial role in preventing runoff into watersheds by effectively managing organic waste and reducing the risk of water pollution. By expanding anaerobic digestion facilities, communities can emphasize their commitment to reducing water pollution, as these facilities help prevent harmful substances from entering the watershed and contaminating local water sources. The implementation of AD technologies contributes to safeguarding the ecological integrity of watersheds, ensuring a cleaner and healthier environment for surrounding communities.
One recent breakthrough in AD technology revolves around the ability to digest wood waste. Wood, with its rigid and tough cell walls presents a challenge for traditional AD processes.
The microorganisms responsible for the digestion process, known as “bugs,” struggle to break down these cell walls effectively.
However, recent advancements have overcome this hurdle by introducing pre-treatment techniques that facilitate the breakdown of wood waste. These innovations enable AD facilities to extract energy from wood waste, further expanding the range of organic materials that can be effectively utilized in the digestion process.
Biogas, the primary byproduct of AD, consists primarily of methane and carbon dioxide. The most popular and practical application of biogas currently is to clean it up, convert it to pipeline quality, and inject it into the natural gas pipeline, where it can be sold as renewable natural gas (RNG).
This approach not only reduces reliance on fossil fuels but also supports the transition to a more renewable energy mix. However, the potential uses of biogas extend beyond RNG. The versatility of biogas allows for its conversion into various consumable energy products, bypassing the need to support natural gas infrastructure. This flexibility aligns with the goal of achieving more complete consumption profiles across society, thereby facilitating a greater reliance on renewable energy sources.
Biogas is also versatile. Biogas holds the potential to be converted into green hydrogen, a clean and renewable energy source. Through a process called biogas reforming, the methane content in biogas can be separated and transformed into hydrogen gas, which has various applications in fuel cells and clean energy systems. This conversion process not only maximizes the energy value of biogas but also provides a sustainable pathway to produce green hydrogen.
While the potential of AD is significant, certain challenges need to be addressed to fully realise its impact. Regulatory barriers and complex frameworks can hinder the growth and operational efficiency of AD facilities.
Streamlining regulations, providing consistent policies, and ensuring sufficient financial support from governments and policymakers are essential steps to foster the growth of the AD industry. These actions would enable AD companies to plan and make long-term investments, creating a favorable environment for sustainable practices.
AD technology represents a significant step towards achieving sustainability and renewable energy goals. Its impact extends beyond renewable energy generation, encompassing waste management, water pollution prevention, and the versatile applications of biogas.
The ability to digest wood waste demonstrates the continuous advancements in AD technology, expanding the range of organic materials that can be effectively processed. By embracing anaerobic digestion and overcoming regulatory and policy challenges, we can unlock its full potential, paving the way for a cleaner and more sustainable future. Through collective efforts, governments, industries, and communities can support the growth of AD facilities and contribute to a more environmentally friendly and resilient society.
By actively engaging in the material supply for anaerobic digestion facilities, organizations can receive comprehensive reports showcasing their direct impact on reducing their Scope 3 and 4 emissions. These reports not only highlight their contribution to environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals, but also provide valuable insights into their progress in achieving decarbonization objectives. This transparency and alignment with sustainability targets empowers organizations to make informed decisions.

Transgrid, the operator and manager of the high voltage electricity transmission network in NSW and the Australian Capital Territory, said a thorough assessment of options had identified big batteries as the best way forward in terms of providing the biggest benefits for the two network growth regions.
“Our grid is changing, which is why we’re going beyond the traditional poles and wires approach and embracing new technologies and business models to meet the needs of consumers and keep the system reliable,” Transgrid Executive General Manager of Network Marie Jordan said.
“We’re looking to purchase services from providers who own and operate battery storage. This approach helps meet growing demand in both regions faster than upgrading the existing network.”
Transgrid is seeking services from two separate battery energy storage systems to be installed at substations near Panorama and Parkes, and other big battery to be installed near Narrabri or Gunnedah in the North West Slopes region.
Jordan said the grid-scale batteries will provide dynamic reactive support to manage voltage variations on Transgrid’s network during high demand periods, from 2025 or soon thereafter.
“These services will help us unlock extra capacity on the transmission network and use the existing network better and avoid interruptions to supply for consumers,” she said. “The service providers can also use the batteries to trade in the energy market when not needed to support Transgrid’s network, so it’s a win-win for the power system.”
Transgrid modelling indicates electricity demand will increase substantially in the Bathurst, Orange and Parkes areas and the North West Slopes region in the near future due to the connection of new industrial loads and general load growth.
The network operator said multiple options for addressing the emerging load constraints in both areas had been examined and, in each case, the best option involved services provided by third-party battery energy storage facilities.
Jordan said the project is amongst the first in the National Electricity Market where a solution involving large-scale batteries has outperformed other options throughout the Regulatory Investment Test for Transmission (RIT-T).
“It is another sign of how rapidly our energy system is changing and how we need to adapt and embrace new technology as we embark on the energy transition,” she said.
Figures provided by Transgrid show the proposals from third-party battery operators had outperformed the poles and wires solutions, promising to deliver up to $2,550 million (USD 1,717 million) in net benefits in the Orange and Parkes area and $459 million in net benefits in the North West Slopes region.
Transgrid will now enter a competitive procurement process and begin commercial negotiations with non-network proponents to put contracts in place. The network operator will host a market forum on August 10 with potential service providers invited to register.
Subject to approvals, the batteries could be completed by 2024-2025.

The focus will be on the production of clean energy technologies including solar panels, battery energy storage systems, and electrolysers used for producing hydrogen.
Bowen said Australia’s contribution will support an initial round of studies to accelerate the development of investment-ready projects, which could include products and activities like solar ingots, wafer production and battery cell component manufacturing.
The investment comes after Australia and it Quad nation partners India, Japan and the United States earlier this year agreed on a partnership to strengthen security and shore up clean energy supply chains in the Indo-Pacific.
The Quad nations said the agreement would provide the basis for a diverse, secure, transparent and resilient clean energy supply chain in the region.
Bowen said secure and diversified clean energy supply chains are an integral part of achieving the Indo-Pacific’s collective energy security, emissions reduction goals and transition to a net zero future.
“Diversifying and expanding supply chains is important to achieve Australia’s and our partners’ net zero targets,” he said.
Bowen said the initiative will be developed in close consultation with Indo-Pacific countries, to ensure it complements domestic efforts and delivers tangible outcomes.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/24/electranet-announces-construction-milestone-for-tri-state-transmission-project/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 24, 2023",ElectraNet announces construction milestone for tri-state transmission project,"ElectraNet, one of two transmission network operators delivering the EnergyConnect high-voltage interconnector that will enable energy sharing between South Australia, New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, said construction is progressing well across the entire project.
ElectraNet Project Director Ralf Ricciardi said gantry towers and transformers have been installed at the new substation being built at Bundey and draw wire and conductor rollout is on schedule from Robertstown in the state’s mid north to the SA-NSW border.

“We have also completed all gantry towers at this new substation, which upon completion, will be the largest in South Australia,” he said, adding the transformers and reactors at the Bundey substation will soon be ready for commissioning.
“Rollout of draw wire and conductor is on schedule between the SA-NSW border and Bundey substation, and we have also commenced draw wire rollout between the Bundey and Robertstown substations.”
Ricciardi said in addition to the line and substation works, all telecommunications towers as part of the project are now completed.
The EnergyConnect project will link Robertstown, in SA’s mid-north to Wagga Wagga in southwest NSW via Buronga, with an additional ‘spur’ link between Buronga and Red Cliffs in northwest Victoria. The interconnector will provide 800 MW of nominal transfer capacity in both directions.

ElectraNet’s construction milestone coincided with transmission network owner Transgrid, which will deliver the 700km NSW section of the EnergyConnect project from Wagga Wagga to the SA border, with a connection to Red Cliffs in Victoria, announcing that the final 50m high transmission tower of the western NSW section of the project had been erected.
The NSW western section includes works between the NSW-SA border, Transgrid’s existing substation at Buronga, and the NSW-Victorian border near Monak.
“The NSW section of Australia’s largest transmission project has reached its furthest western point, with crews erecting a steel tower at the South Australian border,” Transgrid said. “The final western tower has been installed just 100 metres from the border at Chowilla where it will connect to EnergyConnect’s South Australian section.”
It is anticipated construction of Project EnergyConnect will be completed by the end of 2024 with the release of full transfer capability planned by mid-2026.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/24/european-warehouses-store-40-gw-of-unsold-solar-panels/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA,EUROPE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 24, 2023",European warehouses store 40 GW of unsold solar panels,"Rystad Energy has revealed that European warehouses currently host around 40 GW of Chinese-made solar panels.
The Norwegian consulting firm said that the stored solar panels are worth about $11.57 billion (€7 billion). It noted that solar module imports from China continued to increase this year, despite the high inventory levels.
“Imports in January were 17% higher compared to 2022, with February up 22%, March surging 51%, April up 16%, and May growing 6% over last year,” Rystad Energy explained. “If current import levels continue, 2023 will be a record-breaking year for imports and inventory. Annual imports look set to hit 120 GWdc, far surpassing expected capacity installations of 63 GW (DC).”
 

Rystad Energy said that Europe is “desperate” to secure PV components at affordable prices. It warned that made-in-Europe products may not be immediately available.
“Although efforts are underway to build a reliable solar supply chain in Europe, the need for panels now means leaders cannot wait until 2025 or later to buy European,” said Marius Mordal Bakke, senior supply chain analyst at Rystad Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/24/separator-tech-to-prevent-battery-fires/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"JULY 24, 2023",Separator tech to prevent battery fires,"Nuvola Technology has unveiled its patented direct deposition separator technology, which could replace conventional film separators and deliver incremental improvements in safety and performance.
The SafeCoat Direct Deposition Separator material is the first product launched by the Los Angeles-based startup, formerly known as Millibatt. Under its previous name, the venture-funded company focused on small, rechargeable, high-density batteries for wearables, biomedical uses, and Internet of Things sensor applications.
Nuvola said that it has been selected as one of 10 winners in LG Energy Solution’s annual 2022 Battery Challenge. The competition brought together more than 100 companies with new battery technologies and business models.
SafeCoat is described as a chemistry-agnostic, drop-in solution for lithium-ion batteries compatible with mainstream lithium-ion manufacturing techniques. The porous polymer coating sprayed directly on the entire electrode surface encapsulates and protects them from a thermal runaway and a potential fire.
According to Nuvola, the battery system’s weak point are thousands of tissue-paper thin folded sheets of a porous plastic membrane that keep electrodes apart and make the battery prone to manufacturing errors and failure.
“During the battery assembly process, a single sheet separator can become damaged, creating an undetectable wrinkle, misalignment, misfolding, or even a tiny tear allowing the electrodes to come in contact. This may cause a fire – days, months, or years later,” said the company.
In addition to improving safety, Safe Coat is said to increase the active battery material volume, improving the energy density by up to 20%. Decreasing the thickness of the separator from the plastic film separator’s 20µm to SafeCoat’s 5 µm layer leaves more room for lithium ions in the same physical space.
According to the company, the Nuvola SafeCoat product is now under evaluation by several major battery producers and car manufacturers. It expect products using the technology to hit the market in 2025.
