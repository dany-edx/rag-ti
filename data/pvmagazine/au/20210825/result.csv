Now, after delivering what it saw as future options back in May, the Energy Security Board’s (ESB) reforms have again hit turbulence because of the proposal of a Physical Retailer Reliability Obligation (PRRO), essentially a capacity market mechanism in which coal generators could be paid to stay in business. 
While much of the criticism has been directed at the Board, Dan Cass, the Australia Institute’s energy policy and regulatory lead, says the core problem is not building a capacity market itself, which could be valuable, but rather having the federal government steering the design on behalf of vested interests in coal and gas.

Cass has been “intimately involved” in the ESB’s reform process over the past years and was one of 16 stakeholders appointed to work on a strategy for retiring ageing coal generators. He says scheduling the retirement of coal generators is necessary for an orderly transition, and believes the ESB’s reforms, if they are led by well informed state ministers and stakeholders, could deliver this without prolonging coal’s inevitable departure.
In fact, he believes that the vast majority of people involved in the ESB process, including the board itself, are on the same page, eager to not delay coal’s exist anymore than absolutely necessary.
The federal government, and in particular energy minster Angus Taylor, seem less on board with this planned exit strategy though. Cass, like many others, is concerned the federal government is trying to use the capacity market proposal (entitled the ‘physical retailer reliability obligation’) not as a mechanism to ensure reliability on the path to a clean energy transition, but rather as a way to keep coal in the energy mix in perpetuity – or at least to delay its demise.
“He’s committed to keeping fossil fuels going as long as possible, even if that means propping them up when they are unprofitable,” Cass told pv magazine Australia.
“That’s not a technological reform blueprint reform for the NEM, it’s a political agenda.”

Concern around the strategy and how it badly it could shape the reforms led Cass and his colleagues at the Australia Institute to today publish an open letter advertisement in newspapers addressing energy ministers and the ESB, imploring them to not subsidise coal.
The open letter was signed by Tesla’s Australasian Energy Director, Mark Twidell, as well as global inverter manufacturer, Enphase, retailer Flow Power, co-operative Enova Community Power, and more. The strategy behind the move, Cass said, was to ensure ministers know that the companies who are actually building tomorrow’s technology do not support coal.
Last Friday, Australia’s energy ministers met to discuss the ESB’s final recommendations on the Post-2025 Market Design, after it delivered its options in May. 
Due to the pandemic, the meeting was classed as National Cabinet, meaning it took place in confidence. That is despite the fact, as Cass noted, the ESB’s energy reform advice can in “no way” be counted as national cabinet. This shroud of secrecy, Cass said, has caused high level rifts between state ministers and other stakeholders and the federal government.
Cass pointed to this as a way of sowing confusion and casting doubt around the reforms, a tactic which leads to fracturing and delays and ultimately benefits incumbents.
In his media release on the meeting, Taylor said: “ministers agreed it is important to release the ESB’s final advice documents in relation to its recommendations to inform public discussion of these recommendations.” No information has been released to date.

The Australian Capital Territory’s (ACT) energy minister, Shane Rattenbury, has also voiced concerns about the reforms. On August 7, the state minister wrote to ESB Chair Kerry Schott. In the letter, Ratternbury outlined he had received “stakeholder reaction” to the capacity market proposal “and how this may perpetuate operation, and delay the orderly market exit, of thermal electricity generation.”
In the letter, Rattenbury sought assurance from Schott that the recommendation “will not support thermal electricity generation beyond the minimum that is required to maintain the reliability of the electricity system.” Additionally, he asked whether there might be alternative measures which could be taken to mitigate the need for the proposed mechanism.
The reason the ESB is recommending Australia develop a capacity market, which would essentially pay power stations to guarantee a certain amount of generation capacity available to the market, is to ensure reliability. The problem is, Cass says, coal generators are not necessarily the dependable generators they are marketed as, nor are they easy to turn on and off – meaning they can’t respond quickly to electricity demand surges and troughs.

Technology which can better respond, Cass says, is right “on the brink.” For instance, inverter based technologies, he says, are already proving their ‘grid forming’ capabilities in trials in Australia. Likewise, technologies like Virtual Power Plants and battery storage, as well as demand response will play bigger roles into the future. 
On principle, Cass doesn’t oppose the idea of a capacity mechanism, such as the existing Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (RERT). In fact, he thinks there is a space for a well designed mechanism to smooth the exit of coal, but it needs to be agnostic and not favour thermal generation over newer technologies.
As a federal minister, minister Taylor does not have constitutional power over electricity, nor has he been a part of the ESB reforms’ inner workings. Moreover, all of the country’s state energy ministers share his position as “bosses” to the ESB, making Taylor one of many. He does, however, have a critical leadership role as the national minister, Cass said.
Nonetheless, Cass is confident that if it comes down to well-informed state ministers facing off with Taylor, the outcome will be good. 

The idea that this state by state split will weaken the National Energy Market (NEM), Cass thinks is somewhat beside the point. States are already driving investment in the NEM through their Renewable Energy Zone plans, he said. If states step up with more of a role in firming and security, it would be more of a continuation of things as they are, rather than a split or weakening of the NEM.
“I also don’t think all things are broken,” he added. Rather, he believes real progress has been made with leaders like Daniel Westerman, the new chief of the Australian Energy Market Operator, readying the grid to handle 100% renewable instantaneous generation by 2025.
He also pointed to Kerry Schott and how  unequivocal she’s been that coal’s end is nigh, despite it consistently putting her in the federal government’s firing line. “I feel like that’s a really big shift,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/25/hyrogen-must-take-centre-stage-at-cop26/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"AUGUST 25, 2021",Hydrogen must take centre stage at COP26,"Having net zero targets are increasingly common and hugely important, but COP26 must go far beyond setting new emissions targets. Ensuring that hydrogen is not just a ‘fuel for the future’, but a fuel that needs to be increasingly implemented into global society from today, should be top of the agenda.
Hydrogen is a versatile, safe and clean form of energy. It is used as a fuel for power and in industry for feedstock. With the potential for zero emissions at the point of use, its only by-product can be water and it can be stored and transported in liquid or gas form.
Many take the view that hydrogen could be a key solution to many of the challenges that need to be overcome to make a low carbon environment a reality. Indeed, hydrogen has the potential to decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors such as heavy industry and heavy-duty transport and chemicals which together are responsible for over one third of global CO2 emissions.
The use of hydrogen in industry is nothing new. The reason why hydrogen is so much in focus today is because it is now needed, along with electrification, in significantly greater quantities to drive energy transition across all sectors. But with that comes various challenges, which often tend to stem from the manufacturing process.
Hydrogen can be produced in various forms, often distinguished by colour. The manufacture of grey hydrogen, for instance, is extracted from natural gas and generates CO2 emissions; blue hydrogen is fossil-based with carbon capture technology, with up to 90% of emissions captured and stored/ reused; green hydrogen is produced by electrolysis using renewable energy sources (wind, solar etc.) and thus produces zero carbon.
Whilst current hydrogen production is largely derived from high-carbon sources, electrolysis-based low-carbon hydrogen makes up 79% of the overall future pipeline for hydrogen and so green and blue hydrogen will be of key focus at COP26.
The high cost of clean hydrogen production will need to be addressed. The EU has already put forward its hydrogen strategy, which aims to build capacity from 6 gigawatts (GW) by 2024 to 40 GW by 2030. And as electrolyser capacity and the supply chain scales up, so production costs will drop. Given the electrolysis process is highly energy-intensive, electricity costs will also need to shift lower. Hydrogen economics are moving in the right direction, but more needs to be done.
Hydrogen will play a major role in the energy mix; we estimate that it will account for 7% of final global energy demand by 2050. To get to this point, it is likely that all forms of hydrogen will be required, but over time clean (green and blue) hydrogen will need to be accelerated into production in far greater quantities, driven by geography, incentives and lower renewable energy costs. Equally, grey hydrogen should be disincentivised with carbon taxes.
But it’s not just about supply. Demand also needs to be developed at the same time to ensure both transport and storage can be fully integrated into our current electricity system. With 40% of global hydrogen production today, demand is currently driven by China and the US due to their significant refining and chemical demand. COP26 should not just highlight solutions to the development and innovation of hydrogen technology, but also how it can be incorporated more evenly across global sectors as well.
The importance of hydrogen in the overall fuel mix is clear, but for it to take on a more significant role, further aggressive policy decisions need to be made. While several policy announcements have been forthcoming more recently, greater direct support for hydrogen will also be required in the form of concrete policy decisions, potentially announced at COP26. We will look for:
The Conference often matters, not just because of the updated pledges and policies that are submitted by all parties ahead of the conference, but also due to the negotiations that take place over two weeks during the conference.
Post Covid-19, as global economies continue to recover with an increased sense of risk, we suspect that negotiations at COP26 may not lead to major new announcements about how much green hydrogen to produce. However, as a result of negotiations, we do see the prospect of new collaborations and alliances for action on green hydrogen.
For COP26 to unlock the status quo and drive change, all players must demonstrate their willingness to exercise their support for innovation and deployment of hydrogen supply chains. Leaders will also have an opportunity to more accurately provide a universal definition of low-carbon hydrogen, as well as guarantee its origins. Funding announcements for hydrogen production and transport use across current and new sectors will additionally be in focus.
The time for talking is over and the stage of implementation must now begin.

A recent study conducted by scientists from Germany’s Jülich Institute for Energy and Climate Research (IEK-5) proposes the integration of battery storage into systems for hydrogen production relying on PV-powered water splitting electrochemical (EC) cells.
According to the researchers, directly integrating batteries in these systems without adding power management electronics would help smoothen PV power fluctuation and, simultaneously, stabilise the performance of the EC components. “This combination can be considered as a basic unit of a PV-driven power source with both short-term and long-term energy storage functions,” they stated.
In the proposed system configuration, the PV cell is connected in parallel to the EC unit and the battery. The latter can shift working point towards lower working point voltage, which the German group describes as having high relevance for solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. “We can see that battery can improve coupling in otherwise mismatched PV-EC system, which is a particular case of matching PV to a load with aid of a battery,” it explained.
The device’s PV unit was built with a triple‐junction silicon solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 11.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 2.25 V, a short-circuit current of 7.4 mA/cm2,, and a fill factor of 67.9%. The electrochemical cell was made of polyether ether ketone (PPEK) filled with a potassium hydroxide solution and nickel catalyst pair. The lithium-ion battery was built with a commercial lithium ferrophosphate (LFP) cathode, a lithium titanate (LTO) anode, and a separator based on a glass fibre membrane soaked with commercial electrolyte LP30. Each of the three components is of small scale with areas of 1 cm2 and below.
The scientists explained that when sunlight hits the solar cell during the daytime, the PV unit provides a voltage of approximately 2.0 V across the EC cell and the battery while supplying a current of 3.8 mA flow through the EC and 0.6 mA through the battery. When the full state of charge is reached, the battery current is about zero for almost 40 minutes and the EC cell receives all the current from the PV cell. “Once the light is turned off and solar cell is disconnected the discharge phase begins,” they further explained.
The performance of the system was compared with that of an identical device operating without the battery and the scientists found that their novel configuration can not only smoothen out the PV power fluctuations and facilitate power coupling, but also improve solar to hydrogen efficiency.
“Simple parallel connection of PV, EC, and battery in PV-EC-B system is sufficient to provide partial storage of the PV energy and its further utilisation for water splitting when PV is idle at night times,” the scientists stated, noting that the battery open-circuit voltage is a key parameter to maximise solar-to-hydrogen efficiency under a given duty cycle. “High battery capacities and duty cycles with short light periods followed by long dark periods are beneficial for solar-to-hydrogen efficiency in PV-EC-B system allowing utilisation of battery charge at lower current and hence lower overpotential in the EC cell.”
All the details on the system configuration can be found in the paper “Storage batteries in photovoltaic–electrochemical device for solar hydrogen production,” published in the Journal of Power Sources.
The same research group unveiled in June 2020 an integrated PV-EC device with an active area of 0.5 cm2 developed with solar panels based on triple‐junction thin‐film silicon solar cells with an efficiency rating of 10.8% and an electro-deposited bifunctional nickel iron molybdenum water‐splitting catalyst.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/25/redox-flow-battery-retains-more-than-90-of-capacity-over-6000-cycles-via-new-catholyte/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 25, 2021","Redox flow battery retains more than 90% of capacity over 6,000 cycles via new catholyte","pv magazine Global
Researchers at the University of Akron in the United States have developed a water-soluble positive electrolyte – a, so-called catholyte – that is claimed to increase the energy density of aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs).
The scientists shaped the catholyte by using two ligands: 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic (Dcbpy) acid, and cyanide. Cyanide was previously used in other research and was found to be able to improve the voltage and solubility of redox batteries compared to the commonly used ferrocyanide ligands.
The academics built the battery through what they called a symmetry-breaking strategy, which consists of changing the symmetry of the redox-active organic molecules, instead of using the common approach of attaching a hydrophilic functional group. Hydrophilic functional groups are membranes used to achieve fast ion transport combined with high molecular selectivity, and to provide aqueous organic flow batteries with energy efficiency and capacity retention.
The research group said its approach results in a considerable improvement of the molecules’ solubility. The battery is claimed to have retained more than 90% of capacity over 6,000 cycles, which the scientists said projects “more than 16 years of uninterrupted service [at] a pace of one cycle per day.” The capacity fading rate was 0.00158% per cycle, or 0.217% per day.
The scientists are currently planning to design new materials for this battery technology and have already submitted a patent application to the relevant U.S. authorities. “To significantly improve the performance of aqueous organic RFBs, the urgency of developing new catholyte[s] is crucial,” said researcher Yu Zhu.
The device was described in the paper Symmetry-breaking design of an organic iron complex catholyte for a long cyclability aqueous organic redox flow battery, published in nature energy.
