While founder Warwick Johnston tells pv magazine Australia he saw a small rebound in shorter warranties over this period as well, he says this is likely from an uptick in minor brands which tend to have shorter warranties, rather than manufacturers secretly reducing warranty periods.
This data confirms a much longer trend of solar warranty inflation, with SunPower Maxeon notably  changing the pace in 2022 with the introduction of a 40-year warranty, a move which sparked extensions from other brands like Trina Solar.

Intended to ease fear, these exorbitant warranties incite the opposite in some Australian installers, including MC Electrical’s Mark Cavanagh. He has focused attention on solar warranties for the past three years and has been alarmed by how unreasonable many of the disclaimers within the documents are. When asked how much faith he has in solar warranties, he told pv magazine Australia: “I think zero percent.”
Cavanagh’s anxiety is that these warranties promise his customers something that manufacturers put little weight on actually delivering. “At the end of the day, it’s not the general managers of these manufacturers that are left with the hand grenade, it’s me,” Cavanagh says.

While the list of warranty exclusions can be long and varied, one of the most uniform and problematic clauses is around shading. 
Most manufacturers’ installation and user manuals state panels must not be shaded, ever. 
In real life, there are very few rooftops that could meet this criteria. But these manuals must nonetheless be followed if warranties are to be claimed.
For Cavanagh, this begs the question: why are manufacturers able to promise their panels can perform up to 25, 40 years when this guarantee doesn’t have to hold true in real life situations?
Solar Analytics’ Head of Business Development, Nigel Morris, agrees these shading clauses which lead to warranty breaches are a “potential shit fight.”
Morris says manufacturers can use any number of clauses to squirm out of warranties – obviously undermining their whole premise.
Cavanagh thinks manufacturers approach to warranties are “flippant” – a sentiment that Morris’ experience has largely confirmed.
Morris has worn many hats in his decades in solar, having written warranties and disputed them. He says like most products, warranty duration is as much a function of the marketing and business team as it is hard science and testing data.
“Solar has just ended up being this ridiculously long warranty,” Morris tells pv magazine Australia. “Of course, the devil is in the detail.” 
Warranties are usually customised to different markets and in Morris’ experience, the amount of attention paid to warranty documents varies significantly between manufacturers.
What is often overlooked in warranty discussions is the fact warranties can’t preclude anything that would be covered by Australian consumer law, Morris says. “Over the years, I’ve seen countless documents that contradicted it.”
“Half the time [manufacturers] just fuck it up and they put warranties out that actually wouldn’t hold up in law.”
Another thing most solar owners and many installers don’t grasp is that under Australian law customers have “extremely strong consequential losses protection,” Morris says. That is, if a panel or system underperforms or fails for a period of time, compensation can be claimed for lost generation.
The issue here is that the costs associated with solar systems, be it the cost of replacing panels or claiming lost generation, are usually not significant enough to really warrant a protracted legal battle. Which means warranty claims often come down to the relationships between installers, suppliers and manufacturers.
If lady luck is on your side, customers might have panels where issues show up quickly, perhaps belonging to a faulty batch. In that case, it can be relatively easy to replace the panels on the system since the installer and manufacturer are likely often sending orders back and forth. If the claim falls outside these parameters though – say the panels are more than five years old or the installer has stopped working with the brand – the already convoluted process can take on all kinds of new difficulties.
For installer Cavanagh, it comes down to this: if the warranty claim is too hard to push ahead with, his company will just replace the customer’s solar system for the sake of maintaining reputation.
Cavanagh fears such practices could potentially ruin his company in the future though as the volume of installs increase and the landscape of solar manufacturers change. This is especially worrying for him since he plans to pass his business down to his children. 
“We’re going to be sunk,” Cavanagh says, referring to the fact it is ultimately installers who are faced with unhappy customers holding document promising a panel lifetime which is longer than the manufacturer’s own.
Of course, installation companies can and have run from the hassle, creating a phenomenon of ‘solar orphans.’ But for legitimate install businesses with a longterm visions, this is hardly a viable route.
Given his deep distrust of warranty documents, Cavanagh’s strategy is to focus on panel build quality, only deploying quality products which he thinks will stand the test of time. He spends much time in his warehouse inspecting panels, and while all manufacturers can have batch failures, he says there is a notable difference between “quality” brands which spend money on extensive research and development and their cheaper counterparts.
This “premium” label hardly eases warranty claims though, Cavanagh says. MC Electrical was formerly a major installer of the SunPower Maxeon brand, Cavanagh says, but not long after the company came out with its 40-year warranty, one of Cavanagh’s customers had a problem with water ingress under their panel’s sheet. Maxeon claimed the issue didn’t fall under the warranty, outraging Cavanagh – who then “did the dirtiest email I ever have.”

In the end, Maxeon granted the claim on “goodwill,” but Cavanagh said the company seemed more upset by the tone of his email than by problems with a three year old product that is supposed to last 40 years. “That’s just an extreme case of how hard it is to deal with these people,” he says.
“That kind of makes you really nervous when LG have just gone bust and SunPower does that,” Cavanagh adds.
Another aspect Nigel Morris thinks is under-appreciated for warranties is that it is the importer who holds the ultimate responsibly for their products in Australia. “The person who brings it across the boarder then carries the liability for it,” Morris says.
“What that really means is if you’re a savvy solar business, you want to understand not just where you’re buying your panels and your inverters, but you want to understand who is the importer and who holds the ultimate responsibility for liability and how secure are they. Because that’s the obvious place where people will phoenix to get away from that liability.”
This is something Cavanagh has been grappling with recently. He formerly imported directly from manufacturers, but recently shifted to an electrical wholesaler to source his Q Cells products. Initially he thought the process unnecessarily involved a middle man, but said he’s since changed his mind. “Now if the panel fails in 15 years time, there’s a much higher chance of them [the electrical wholesaler] being around than Q Cells being around,” he says. “So I can go back to them.”
Ultimately though, he feels solar warranties need to be reduced to timeframes where they are actually meaningful, around the 10 to 15 year mark. If not, these unkept promises ultimately erode trust and undermine the businesses of those who use the products.

The in-person sessions are focussed on helping engineers upskill and understand the technicalities of the burgeoning hydrogen industry. For instance, the Hydrogen Industry Technical Series 2023 will focus on things like hydrogen production, storage, handling, transport, dispensation, fuel cells,  plant integration, safety and more.
The Victorian series is the first such Australian event, though pv magazine Australia understands the intention is to host similar events in other states eventually.
Given the majority of the sessions focus on issues downstream of having made the hydrogen itself, the series doesn’t appear to focus exclusively on green hydrogen – though electrolysis as a topic will be covered.
The events will be held on Wednesday evenings from 15 February to 19 April, 2023, and each session will be hosted by relevant industry experts. It will also include three hydrogen industry site visits.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/18/hoymiles-reveals-microinverters-for-high-power-pv-modules/,"INVERTERS,CHINA,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JANUARY 18, 2023",Hoymiles reveals microinverters for high-power PV modules,"From pv magazine Global
China-based inverter manufacturer Hoymiles has developed a line of microinverters for residential and commercial PV projects, with power outputs up to 2,000 VA.
“These microinverters are the cost-effective versions added to Hoymiles classic HMS series,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “They have four input channels, meaning that one microinverter can be connected with four solar panels at once – which is why we call it a ‘four in one.’ Therefore, for the same capacity demand, users can just have one microinverter instead of four regular ones.”
The recommended PV module voltage range is between 320 W and 670 W, with a maximum input voltage of 65 V. The HMS-C line has efficiency ratings up to 96.7% and a nominal maximum power point tracker (MPPT) efficiency of 99.8%.
“What makes the new C series different from the previous HMS series is that they have two MPPTs rather than four, meaning that two panels share one MPPT,” the manufacturer claimed. “This twist offers a great balance between efficient performance and affordability.”
The nominal output voltage is between 220 V and 240 V, and the adjustable output voltage ranges from 180 V to 275 V.
The microinverters measure 331 mm x 195 mm x 42.6 mm and weigh 5.32 kg. They feature an IP67 enclosure rating and a cooling system based on natural convection. The series is connected to Hoymiles’ smart monitoring platform, S-Miles Cloud, so that users can access visual data on the system’s energy production and usage. The new HMS-C series is available in Oceania, Europe, and North America.

TotalEnergies has unveiled the results of the first harvest from three agrivoltaic demonstrators in the French municipalities of Channay (Côte-d’Or), Rivals (Aude), and Valpuiseaux (Essonne).
It said it aims to study the impact of solar panels on crops in order to be able to develop a repository of the agronomic benefits of agrivoltaic projects. For this purpose, it chose different configurations of PV systems and crops.
The agrivoltaic plant in Le Channay, for example, is made up of vertical bifacial photovoltaic panels with 237 kW of power. There are 12 meters of spacing between the modules, as well as several types of crops, including wheat and aromatic herbs.
TotalEnergies said it is analysing the contribution of photovoltaics on a plot of land with declining yield. It noted that the Le Channay location is subject to climatic challenges such as wind, frost and drought.
During the summer 2022 harvest, TotalEnergies, agronomy consultancy Agrosolutions, Dijon Céréales, and Next2Sun were able to record an increase in yield of 1 quintal per hectare for wheat compared to previous harvests and 2 quintals for lentils. They found that wheat protein levels increased by 2%. One explanation could be the protection against high winds, as the panels reduce average wind speeds by 14 km/hour.
TotalEnergies also developed the Valpuiseaux site with Agrosolutions, Agrinovex and Next2Sun. It features vertical bifacial modules. In addition, it developed the Rivals demonstrator with Sudexpe, IFV, InVivo and Ombrea, with 87 kW deployed above pomegranate trees and vines.
The group of companies said the results will now need to be confirmed over time. TotalEnergies currently has more than 140 agrivoltaic projects in various stages of development.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/18/soiling-a-multibillion-dollar-issue/,"RESEARCH,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JANUARY 18, 2023",Soiling – a multibillion-dollar issue,"From pv magazine Global
Soiling – where PV modules become coated with dust, dirt, sand or snow and thus receive less sunlight – is still an underestimated problem for solar power systems. Specialised solutions are now available in the form of anti-soiling glass coatings, automated and manual cleaning products, and models to predict the ways to use them most economically. But our understanding of the issue is still evolving, particularly as PV systems move into new regions with different environmental conditions, and the technology itself continues to change and improve.
A new report by IEA-PVPS seeks to push understanding of soiling a step further, taking a detailed look at the mechanisms causing soiling right down to the size and shape of the individual particles that build up on module’s surface, and the surrounding conditions that lessen or worsen its impacts.
The report estimates that in 2018, soiling caused at least a 3% to 4% loss to global annual energy production from PV – amounting to lost revenue of €3-5 billion ($4.6 – $7.8 billion). And this is expected to increase to around 4% to 5%, and €4 billion to €7 billion this year, thanks to an increase in PV installations in regions highly prone to soiling, economic pressures, and the fact that more efficient PV modules will suffer larger losses to their output due to soiling.
The report shows that soiling is a highly site-specific issue, and that even different areas within a single site can see quite different conditions. This leads the authors to place emphasis on accurate monitoring of these as a key part of the solution.
“An ideal solution should be installable with as little maintenance as possible and be able to detect heterogeneous soiling at both module and site level with high accuracy,” the scientists said.
Meanwhile, additional work is needed to develop accurate models to predict soiling rates at a given site, with current efforts either limited to a very small area, or based only on satellite data that is too generalised to give an accurate portrayal of site conditions.
They note encouraging progress in soiling reduction – with both preventive and corrective solutions now widely available – including anti-soiling coatings and design aspects such as optimised tilt angle, as well as cleaning solutions carefully designed not to damage modules or remove the aforementioned coatings. However, the best solution for any project will depend on the site conditions, and can be a delicate economic calculation placing emphasis on accurate monitoring and measurement.
The authors also note encouraging progress in both models and technologies to deal with snow loading on modules – as solar installations move into more regions affected by snowy conditions. Here they note that further work is needed on specialised components and designs for snowy conditions, with frameless modules, steeper tilt angles, snow-shedding coatings, bifacial modules, and attention to array heights to minimise snow accumulation on the bottom edges of modules all promising approaches.
The report does not address “anthropogenic, zoological or biological sources” of soiling – such as pollution, bird droppings or moss growth. The conclusion for all though is similar, as noted in the report.
“PV soiling will continue to be a global issue, which is expected to be exacerbated by climate change with rising global temperatures and subsequent droughts,” the researchers said. “Further advancements in soiling modelling, adaptation and mitigation are critically necessary.”
