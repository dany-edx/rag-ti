The analyst has labelled 2023 the “probable worst year” for large-scale solar, while the rooftop segment is slated to grow – especially in the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment, according to the 2023 Annual SunWiz Australian PV Report.

Australia is on track for a big first quarter for rooftop solar in 2023, with Sunwiz expecting double-digit growth compared to this time in 2022. 
Sunwiz founder Warwick Johnston describes rooftop solar leads as currently “gushing” – a trait Sunwiz’s analysis shows to be correlated to sales.
“What we returned to at the end of last year [2022] was a situation where leads were stronger than sales and installations,” Johnston said. “So we’re entering Q1 2023 already with a lot of inertia and built up momentum in the pipeline that we need to fulfil.”
Johnston notes that miscalculations in 2022 resulted from a failure to look at lead generation rather than just sales. “The industry overestimated demand and imported huge volumes of panels that lay in warehouses, causing much financial pain.”

The other reason for rooftop’s sunny outlook, Johnston says, is the fact that electricity remains front page news, with anxieties continuing even as Australia’s price cap appears to be curbing the recent price hike trend.
Alongside increased interest in energy independence, there is also a renewed government interest in developing renewable policies. Some of those, like the 7-Star housing requirement were announced in 2022. Likewise, there has been growing support for electric vehicles at both state and federal levels. 
While nothing is confirmed, there are also hopes 2023 might see a home battery subsidy introduced, further driving interest.
The C&I segment is slated to grow more than residential, according to Sunwiz. Over the longer term, Sunwiz forecasts the residential rooftop market will start to wane. It will then fall to installers to incorporate energy storage, electric vehicle (EV) chargers, and other home electrification and automation devices to ensure continued revenue growth.
The overall volume of solar deployed in 2022 was only 2% higher than 2021, and was buoyed by a small number of particularly large projects. 
“However, the amount of solar farms under construction has dropped markedly, meaning 2023 will almost certainly be a year of contraction,” analysis from Sunwiz concludes.

While the trend towards projects over 200 MW in size will continue, with five such projects currently in construction, there is nowhere near as much in the 2023 pipeline.
There is currently 2.2 GW of capacity under construction, which has more than halved from January 2021, when there was 4.9 GW. “This means 2023 is likely to be a far leaner year for solar farm completion – quite possibly its worst since the before commencement of solar farm mass rollout in 2018,” Sunwiz notes.
There are a number of other factors which could come to hinder the solar industry more generally, including increased system prices because of a scarcity of materials. Likewise, Europe’s solar market boom, driven by an explosion in electricity prices, alongside incentives from US President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act could see less equipment making its way to Australia.
Finally, Sunwiz notes that labour shortages could add further constraints.

The Lauriston solar farm, purchased from UK’s renewable developer Hive Energy, is already fully consented and has advanced grid connection approvals, with the companies saying it is ready for panel installation to begin in 2023.
Sheep grazing will be reintroduced below the solar modules upon the project’s completion, making it an agrivoltaic installation.
The 90-hectare Lauriston solar farm will hold approximately 80,000 solar panels and is set to generate around 80 GWh annually.
The project, set to be operational by 2024, will be New Zealand’s first large-scale solar farm. Solar in New Zealand is still very much in its infancy, with the country getting most of its renewable generation from geothermal, wind and hydroelectric generation plants.
These sources account for roughly 80% of the country’s electricity, and 40% of its total primary energy use.
New Zealand government, sourced from Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment: Energy in New Zealand 2021 figures.
While New Zealand is yet to have a utility-scale solar farm in operation, there has been a number of recent announcements for projects in development, including plans for a 400 MW solar farm from private New Zealand company Todd Generation, and a 147 MW solar farm from UK-based Harmony Energy, both on the country’s North Island. Likewise, Lightsource bp and German investment manager Aquila Capital are looking to develop portfolios in New Zealand.
“There have been lots of solar announcements,” says Tracey Hickman, interim chief executive at Genesis, “but not many have the land, consents and grid connections in place.”
It is for its experience in developing utility-scale solar projects that Genesis Energy has teamed up with FRV Australia, the antipodean arm of Fotowatio Renewable Ventures, which has been owned by Saudi Arabia’s Abdul Latif Jameel Energy since 2015. The FRV Australia arm is today jointly owned by Abdul Latif Jameel Energy and Canada’s Omers Infrastructure.
The joint venture was announced in 2021 and sees Genesis Energy take a 60% stake while FRV Australia controls the remaining 40%. Having delivered a reported 800 MW of solar projects, including approximately 250 MW under construction, FRV Australia said at the time it was ready to expand its regional activities to the New Zealand market.
Together, the pair are aiming to deliver 500 MW of solar capacity in New Zealand over the next five years. 
“FRV Australia and Genesis have developed a very promising pipeline of solar projects expected to be delivered in the coming years. Lauriston solar farm complements our own pipeline and is poised to be the first large scale solar farm reaching operational stage in the country,” says Carlo Frigerio, managing director at FRV Australia.
More broadly, the Lauriston solar farm is part a program from Genesis Energy aiming to displace 2,650 GWh of thermal generation with new renewable power by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/07/malaysian-oil-giant-reportedly-set-to-buy-wirsols-australian-portfolio/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,AUSTRALIA,GERMANY,MALAYSIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 7, 2023",Malaysian oil giant reportedly set to buy Wirsol’s Australian portfolio,"Malaysia’s state-owned oil company Petronas is finalising its acquisition of Wirsol’s Australian renewable portfolio, reports Reuters.
It would mark the fossil fuel giant’s first foray into Australian renewables, part of a larger trend in the industry as majors scramble to secure their future in energy. Petronas is already active in Australia, owning a 40% stake in Queensland’s Gladstone liquefied natural gas project, run by Santos.
One person involved in the Wirsol deal has told Reuters the sale price could be between $900 million to $1 billion.
Wirsol, a subsidiary of German energy group Wircon, owns mostly solar assets in Australia, and some battery storage. In total, the capacity of its operational portfolio sits at 746 MW, with the company saying it has a further 700 MW in its development pipeline.
Wirsol entered the Australian market in 2017 but put its Australian renewables business up for sale in 2022, after ditching plans to publicly list the business. The company has reportedly had trouble selling its solar assets, some of which sit on congested areas of the grid and have their power curtailed. 
In terms of the buyer, in 2022 Petronas formed a renewable energy arm called Gentari. The division is seeking to move into solar, and says it is aiming for a portfolio with 30 GW to 40 GW of capacity by 2030. It is not clear if the Wirsol sale is being conducted by Gentari.
Wirsol’s Australian assets include the 90 MW Clermont Solar Farm in Queensland and the 110 MW Wemen Solar Farm in north-western Victoria. It operates the 149 MW Glenrowan West Solar Farm, also in Victoria, on behalf of German owners Wirtgen Invest and has acquired the land rights to develop the 75-85 MW Barnawartha Solar Farm west of Wodonga in Victoria.
It also co-owns the 25 MW/50 MWh Gannawarra Energy Storage System, a retrofit to 60 MW Gannawarra Solar Farm in Victoria, alongside Edify Energy.

Researchers from Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden have compared the energy savings potential of alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) distribution systems for residential buildings equipped with PV and battery storage systems. In particular, they looked at whether DC setups could lead to lower energy losses.
“One aspect derived from the work is that we could present modelled loss-savings with DC distribution for a Nordic climate with – on average – lower irradiance,” researcher Patrik Ollas told pv magazine. “Also, the effect – and proven necessity – of PV and battery storage for achieving energy savings with DC.”
For their analysis of the daily and seasonal performance of the two topologies, the scientists used a full-year data set of load usage, PV generation, load-dependent efficiency characteristics of power electronic converters (PECs), and battery storage. They considered AC and DC configurations for a building with a south-oriented 3.6 kW solar-plus-storage installation at a tilt angle of 45 degrees. They assumed the building had space and domestic hot water heating via a ground-source heat pump.
“Individual measurements were obtained for the following appliances: ground-source heat pump, ventilation, water pumps, and PV generation,” the scientists said, noting that the annual load demand is 6,354 kWh, with PV generating 3,113 kWh. “This study was performed for a grid-tied building; a bidirectional AC/DC converter was needed for grid interaction.”
The work considered four different system topologies: AC—230 VAC with load-dependent efficiency, DC1—380 VDC with load-dependent efficiency, DC2—380 VDC with fixed converter efficiency, and DC3—380 and 20 VDC with load-dependent efficiency.
“A 20 VDC sub-voltage level was added to DC1 and DC2 to supply the smaller loads and lighting through a central DC/DC converter,” said the research team.
They found that the bidirectional converter losses significantly differ when modelled with fixed and load-dependent efficiency characteristics. They also found that the DC topology could achieve energy savings even without the inclusion of PV or battery storage.
“The losses of the grid-tied converter using a constant efficiency approach (DC2) were 34% lower than those in the case implementing load-dependent efficiency (DC1),” they said. “The system efficiency values of the respective systems (AC and DC1−3) were 95.3, 94.3, 95.8, and 93.7%, respectively.”
The group concluded that the DC setup did not present a favourable option in terms of loss reduction without the inclusion of a PV and battery system.
“In a more scientific context, the erroneous of using constant efficiencies for both the battery and power electronic converter was highlighted,” Ollas concluded. “Also, the most significant savings were obtained when PV power was fed to the loads directly or via the battery storage. I acknowledge that DC distribution in buildings is a niche application and is caught in a Catch-22 situation regarding supply of products and demand. However, some particular cases could be interesting for this, for example internal DC grids with PV, battery and EV coupling and office buildings with a good correlation between PV and load demand.”
The researchers presented their findings in “Energy Loss Savings Using Direct Current Distribution in a Residential Building with Solar Photovoltaic and Battery Storage,” which was recently published in Energies.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/07/mobile-hydrogen-refuelling-stations-set-for-remote-mines-and-industrial-sectors/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,AUSTRIA,NEW ZEALAND,UNITED KINGDOM",BLAKE MATICH,"FEBRUARY 7, 2023",Mobile hydrogen refuelling stations set for remote mines and industrial sectors,"UK-based Enermech and Austria-based Wolftank Group have signed a distribution agreement to bring hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS) to Australia and New Zealand’s industrial sectors.
With industry looking to cut fossil fuel dependence, one of the most obvious avenues for carbon emissions reduction is the transition of transport fleets to net zero emissions vehicles such as electric vehicles or hydrogen-powered vehicles.
While battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are likely to dominate short-haul freight, long-haul freight is increasingly looking to hydrogen-powered solutions. This preference can be largely put down to the faster refuelling methods of hydrogen and the reduced range anxiety. What is more, the lighter weight compared to BEVs mean an increased payload capacity.
Wolftank’s mobile HRS systems are ideally suited to remote locations such as mine sites and industrial sites where hydrogen refuelling options would otherwise be limited. According to the company its technology allows hydrogen-powered vehicles to be fast-refilled on par with traditional fossil-fuel powered vehicles.
Enermech will supply, install, commission and maintain Wolftank’s HRS systems in both Australia and New Zealand. Enermech’s Asia Pacific Regional Director Garry Ford noted that “hydrogen produces no carbon emissions providing flexible, storable and safe alternative for companies operating in transport intense sectors such as mining and heavy haulage, where operations are often based in outlying places. However, one of the main challenges is the lack of refuelling infrastructure in these remote areas to make it a viable solution.”
For this reason, Ford describes Wolftank’s HRS as a “game changer.”
Wolftank’s multimodal H2 supply solutions for various types of transport can be serviced by its prefabricated HRS for heavy (350 bar) and passenger (700 bar) vehicles.
According to analysts at McKinsey, by 2035 as many as 850,000 hydrogen-fuelled medium- and heavy-duty trucks could be in the road in Europe alone. Those vehicles would consume 6,900 metric kilotons of hydrogen annually and require up to 4,800 HRS. McKinsey asserts that a medium-size HRS with a daily capacity of 500 kg “could reach break-even prices at 55% utilisation, depending on the hydrogen sourcing costs and sales.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/07/overcoming-thermal-issues-of-vanadium-redox-flow-batteries/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"FEBRUARY 7, 2023",Overcoming thermal issues of vanadium redox flow batteries,"From pv magazine Global
Unlike lithium-ion batteries, vanadium flow batteries store energy in a non-flammable, liquid electrolyte and do not degrade with cycling. They hold the promise of more than 10-hour duration storage, high recyclability, and 25 years or more lifespan. However, these batteries suffer from comparatively low energy densities as well as complex thermal issues, which are important to understand in order to achieve their wide application and facilitate the design of next-generation VRFBs with high-power density.
To help understand how to operate VRFB systems efficiently and stably at high temperatures, scientists at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in China have composed a review in which they summarised the thermal issues of VRFBs reported in the literature to date and existing thermal management methods.
Complex thermal issues caused by excessive heat generation during high-rate operations and various heat transfer behaviours in diverse climates dramatically affect the efficiency and stability of VRFBs.
Therefore, according to the review, the operating temperature should be maintained in the range of 10 C to 40 C to ensure VRFBs with high efficiency, weak side reactions, high electrolyte stability, and low crossover.
“The thermal management system of VRFB can maintain the electrolyte temperature in the range of 10 C to 40 C in most climates,” researcher Ren Jiayou told pv magazine. “However, in extreme low temperature climates below -30 C, the thermal management system cannot operate stably.”
To ensure the electrolyte stability, it is important to predict the operating temperature of a VRFB system by cost-effective and efficient thermal models. These include two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and lumped models, as summarised in the research paper, noting that in the future, a combination of these approaches could enhance the simulation accuracy and calculation speed simultaneously.
Furthermore, existing thermal management methods are analysed. Here, employing titanium heat exchangers with anti-corrosive properties to adjust the temperature of electrolytes is recommended as an efficient way to maintain the operating temperature of VRFB systems.
The paper takes the example of a 15 MW/60 MWh VRFB system applied in the Minami-Hayakita substation, Japan. In this project, the heat transfer through pipes plays the main role.
Specifically, when the temperature of electrolytes is higher than the upper limit of the safety threshold, the intake dapper and outlets of a VRFB stack will be opened, allowing the forced air flowing through the heat exchanger to carry the heat to the outside. When the electrolyte temperature is lower than the upper limit of the safety temperature threshold, the intake dampers and outlets will be closed.
In addition to that, with the range of ambient temperature at -10 C to 25 C, the room temperature could be maintained through a passive method, using the heat generation of VRFBs. Based on these two temperature control modes, the electrolyte temperature is maintained in the range of 30 C to 40 C.
Finally, the review highlights the remaining challenges to enhance the efficiency and stability of VRFBs under harsh thermal conditions. The paper, “Thermal issues of vanadium redox flow batteries,”was recently published in International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/07/modular-solar-technology-gets-nod-for-off-grid-power-plant/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 7, 2023",Modular solar technology gets nod for huge off-grid lithium mine project,"Sydney-based prefabricated solar array manufacturer 5B has been appointed as the solar technology provider for a 16 MWp PV system that will form part of a 95 MW hybrid power station being developed by remote power generation specialist Zenith Energy to help meet the energy demands of the Kathleen Valley Lithium Project.
Zenith will construct the 95 MW hybrid power station on a build, own, operate basis at the Kathleen Valley project site near Leinster, about 680 kilometres northeast of Perth. The facility will comprise a 16 MWp solar plant, 30 MW of wind capacity, and a 17 MW/19 MWh battery energy storage system. It will also include 27 MW of gas generation and 5 MW of diesel standby generation.
With a combined 46 MW of generation capacity and 17 MW of battery energy storage, the hybrid power station is expected to have the largest off-grid renewable capacity of any mining project in Australia.
The solar component will comprise 342 of 5B’s flagship modular Maverick solar systems, a PV array in which modules come preassembled onto concrete blocks that replace conventional mounting structures.
Zenith Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Hamish Moffat said the technology had been an integral part of the company’s project bid and was selected in part because it can be unfolded and installed at speed.
“5B has demonstrated that it has the potential to get the Kathleen Valley site to full solar PV generation capacity three months ahead of conventional single access tracker solutions with the potential to save more than 60% of the man hours required on site,” he said.
“This is creating a faster pathway to market for solar PV renewable energy generation assets.”

The first of the Maverick solar systems is expected to be deployed in June 2023, and will be in place before the first production at Kathleen Valley.
Liontown Resources, which has signed binding offtake agreements for 90% of the Kathleen Valley project’s initial planned output, aims to start mining later this year with first production of spodumene concentrate from mid-2024.
Once the project is in operation it will be powered by at least 60% on-site renewables generated through wind and solar coupled to the battery energy storage system.
“It is great to see a green field mining operation incorporating renewable energy from the outset,” 5B Deputy Chief Executive Nicole Kuepper-Russell said.
The Kathleen Valley supply contract builds on an Ecosystem Framework Agreement-Deployment that 5B and Zenith signed in 2022 which formalised an agreement to deploy the Maverick system at a series of mine sites across Australia.
“We are incredibly fortunate to have Zenith Energy as an integration partner who is leveraging the prefabrication and rapid deployment of our solar technology to help mining companies and heavy industry transition to clean energy,” Kuepper-Russell said.
The $545 million (USD 377.6 million) Kathleen Valley project is expected to initially produce about 500,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate – a critical mineral used in the production of lithium-ion batteries – per annum, but Liontown hopes to expand production to 700,000 tonnes by 2029.
