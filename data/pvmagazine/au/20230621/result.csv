Utility-scale renewable energy projects are suffering delays in Australia at the moment – some of these stem from an inability to source equipment, including central inverters and the integrated “power stations” they are increasingly packaged into. Given variations of inverter equipment sits across every renewable energy project, be it solar farms, wind, or battery storage, disruptions have major ramifications. Grid connection, labour shortages, the growing cost of capital, high inflation, land approval disputes and booming global demand are also major factors in project delays.
Lead times for central inverters and power stations used to average around six months. Today, Australia’s top utility-scale manufacturer, German company SMA, is reporting 12 months; Spain’s Ingeteam, second in the leaderboard, looks to have a similar timeframe. Meanwhile, Chinese brand Solis has had to delay the launch of its utility-scale inverter products in Australia.

It is not alone – Ingeteam launched a new central inverter product model in late 2022, but doesn’t expect Australia to house any of these until well into 2024. Both companies have pointed to difficulties sourcing enough components as a key cause of the stall, though other factors are also at play which will be discussed shortly.
This is a key point though: the issue here is not manufacturing inverters themselves, but rather stems from the lack of critical components, most notably transformers, which go into inverter power system products.
“Many critical components have very long lead times,” Carlos Lezana Visus, Ingeteam’s Global Marketing Manager, told pv magazine Australia. These issues have led the company to modify its processes, introducing special new processes to accommodate longer lead times for components.
SMA’s Large Scale and Projects Solutions Manager, Josh Birmingham, also noted a number of these components including clips, switches, and the steel inside transformers, are also in demand by the rapidly growing electric vehicle (EV) industry, leading to further shortages.
Unlike Australia’s top players in the space, Chinese brand Sungrow, a newcomer to the utility-scale inverter segment, reports lead times of six months for Power Conversion Systems for big battery projects and even less for solar projects, Henry Liu, Sungrow Australia’s Grid Connection and Product Manager, told pv magazine Australia. Liu pointed to the company’s vertical integration, noting it produces critical components and sub-assemblies, as a reasons for its shorter lead times. Liu also noted the company’s global manufacturing footprint, which he says has allowed Sungrow to minimise transportation and logistical complexities,.
It is also likely that, because Sungrow is new in the segment, there is less demand for its products compared to brands like SMA and Ingeteam.

SMA is currently in the process of doubling its production capacity in Niestetal, Germany – growing from around 20 GW per annum to 40 GW. Birmingham told pv magazine Australia the company is going to have to double this again to keep up with demand which is mushrooming in Europe and the US.
Birmingham thinks that given Australia is vying with much larger countries, often with more generous renewable support programs, Australian governments need to be doing more to secure its supplies of equipment.
Energy Minister Chris Bowen has frequently echoed this thought, telling Sydney audiences at the Smart Energy Conference in May that it is “inconceivable” just 1% of the 60 million solar panels installed in Australia were actually manufactured onshore. “Same goes with all the other elements in the renewable energy supply chain,” Bowen said. “We need to be making more things here.”

Clean energy supply chains and manufacturing is now the main issue addressed at energy minister “quad” meetings, Bowen said. “We manly focus, almost exclusively, on supply chain and what we can do to get each other making more things.”
Despite not being a particularly new proposition, little clean energy manufacturing has eventuated to date. Manufacturing onshore is often cast as a pipe dream by critics, who point to Australia’s high labour prices.
Given that labour costs account for much less than 5% of SMA’s total production costs, Birmingham doesn’t consider this a major hurdle. Australia is still definitely a viable location to produce inverters in his eyes. “If conditions were right, we [SMA] would open a factory in Australia.”
By conditions, Birmingham is pointing to government support in the form of guaranteed demand. For manufacturing to be worthwhile, government needs to help guarantee the market by, for instance, introducing and strictly enforcing local content requirements, Birmingham says.
While usually bemoaned as the root of delays and lost capital, Ingeteam’s Carlos Visus said Australia’s strict grid connection processes offered it a welcome buffer.
The Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) Generator Performance Standards, or GPS process, usually takes around one year or more to complete. (CEO Daniel Westerman yesterday insisted AEMO was connecting projects “as quickly as we can,” but Spanish Visus pointed out the uniqueness of the Australian process, which he noted was “not happening in most of the rest of the world.”)

While Ingeteam is rarely formally awarded project contracts before developers begin the GPS process, Visus said that in reality the company can move with confidence knowing the process is modelling its product. “No developer would dare to change the technology after all these tests had been approved.”
“So we can start planning all this supply chain to get all the components we need to manufacture the number of inverters we need for that specific project with a lot of advance,” Visus said. “That is why we can have improved logistics in terms of Australian projects. Maybe in other countries, it is harder for us because we have less time. But in Australia we know there is going to be one year, one year and a half, maybe two years even, between when the grid studies starts until when they finish.”
“Otherwise it would be a very different situation and we would be talking about probably problems trying to supply all that we need to supply on time,” he added. “The grid status, in this case, it is good news for us.”
Ingeteam has installed or been awarded nearly 3.5 GW of projects in Australia today. As mentioned, the company launched a new central inverter product model in late 2022 – which, while offering improvements, is a more onerous model to manufacture in terms of componentry. 
This, plus the fact Australia’s grid processes take so long, means Ingeteam will continue to favour the older model here, using it on all projects throughout 2023. It is already running grid status processes with AEMO for new model but will wait until this is fully completed before offering the model in Australia.
“We need to wait until all this grid studies are done and are successfully passed to start to manufacture and supply all these new inverter models for Australia,” Visus said, pointing to a start date maybe by 2024.
To understand the Australian market’s lead time blow outs, the global picture warrants consideration. Europe is trying to decouple from Russian gas by ramping up renewables, the US has introduced the one of the globe’s largest renewable subsidy programs in its Inflation Reduction Act, meanwhile skyrocketing energy prices have seen the residential and commercial segments surge.
Given the free market dictates that product flows where the most money is, the substantially larger markets of Europe, the US, and Asia, including China and India, simply have greater pull than Australia.

Both within and outside of Australia, the renewable energy industry is in something of a “frenzy,” as Risen Australia’s Grid Connection and Technical Services Manager, Michael Forder, puts it. Projects put on pause during Covid have restarted, and new government targets and policies have kicked the industry into a new gear.
Meanwhile, disruptions from the pandemic continue to reverberate. “What we’ve found is main power transformers, inverters, circuit breakers, isolators and disconnectors – two years ago, I started seeing general lead times increase 20-50% and even in some instances to 100% so that 20 weeks become 30 become 40,” Forder told pv magazine Australia.
“It was fundamental resource shortages: the factories had people with Covid, so they couldn’t do their three shifts a day; their raw products were being constrained, they couldn’t get the raw products in; the shipping delays due to lack of shipping containers, lack of ships, all sorts of other reasons there. So things started to take longer to be delivered and cost more.”
“I don’t think inverters are anything special – they’re just caught up in the general issues,” Forder added.

Now it seems Australia’s third largest ‘gentailer’ could join the ranks, with finance group Macquarie reportedly in talks to acquire as much as a 50% stake in EnergyAustralia.
Macquarie has often boasted about its clean energy credentials, though this was undermined by a recent report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), which found Macquarie Group had continued to invest heavily in fossil fuel projects after signing up to the international Net Zero Banking Alliance in 2021.
Nonetheless, the company appears eager to beef up its energy assets as the industry transitions, and is reportedly looking to EnergyAustralia as the vehicle for that. Still in the very early stages, few details of any potential deal have made their way into the public sphere yet.

Meanwhile, Australian technology billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes has sold part of his stake in AGL Energy. The sale is fairly modest, taking the billionaire’s private Grok Ventures stake from 11.3% to 10.41%. AGL remains Grok’s largest investment.
After failing to takeover AGL with then-partner Brookfield, Cannon-Brookes took a new route by buying a controlling stake in the publicly listed company in May 2022. Using his position as a significant shareholder, he was able to derail the company’s demerger plans and subsequently transform AGL’s top management and board.
In a statement, Grok Ventures’ CEO Jeremy Kwong-Law said the sale “should not be seen as a broader divestment plan or change in our focus.”
“Grok remains AGL’s largest shareholder, and we continue to view AGL as a high conviction investment in our portfolio,” he added.
Origin’s takeover by Canadian-fund Brookfield is currently being reviewed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Independent news organisation Michael West Media has recently ramped up its investigations into Brookfield’s successful tax evasion, including in Australia.

In many ways, the role is a natural fit for Australia – not only does it have “internationally significant critical minerals endowments,” as the government puts it, but it also has a highly developed mining industry and an established global reputation as a resources exporter.
The key, as many in government and industry have long pointed out, is moving from exporting raw materials to actually bringing ‘value-added’ mineral and chemical processing operations onshore. It would seem a critical minerals strategy would tackle exactly these questions, but unfortunately very few practical proposals are included in the document.

The main action in the strategy is $500 million (USD 340 million) for the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, specifically for projects in the critical minerals sector with a particular focus on downstream processing. 
The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) is like the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) in that the federal government provides it funding to hand out in various forms to projects it deems worthy of support. Unlike CEFC though, it doesn’t have a particular focus on energy or renewables, but supports a wide range of industries. As the name suggests, it focuses on projects within the north of Australia, including Queensland, the Northern Territory and north Western Australia.
(In separate news, the federal Greens party has  said it will not support Labor’s broader plan to pump a total of $2 billion into NAIF without guardrails to ensure that it cannot be used to finance coal and gas.)
While this funding will directly support some projects, its scope is clearly limited. Sitting aside this, the government notes it plans to “establish the National Reconstruction Fund, which includes $1 billion for value-add in resources and $3 billion for renewables and low emissions technologies,” though no further detail is given here on how this specifically furthers critical minerals developments.
The strategy will also establish a process to update the nation’s critical minerals list, which currently includes 26 commodities.

The strategy notes independent modelling has found increasing exports of critical minerals and energy-transition minerals could create more than 115,000 new jobs and add $71.2 billion to Australia’s GDP by 2040. 
“However, the number of jobs could increase by 262,600 and the increase in GDP strengthen to $133.5 billion by 2040 if Australia builds downstream refining and processing capability and secures a greater share of trade and investment,” it says.

Despite clearly flagging processing could almost double revenues, the strategy does not include a government support scheme to incentivise businesses to processes or build manufacturing capacity onshore. 
Rather what it does is repeatedly hand off to other funds or initiatives like the Critical Minerals Development Program, Critical Minerals Facility, the Australian Made Battery Plan, which gives the sense of an endless merry-go-round.
The impetus to build sovereign processing and manufacturing capability does not stand alone in the strategy either, but is folded into one of the six focus areas, entitled ‘Developing strategically important projects, with targeted support.’ 
Exactly what form this ‘targeted’ support will take has some definition when it comes to mining exploration but very little for anything downstream of that. “The government is analysing the type and volumes of minerals our emerging downstream processing and manufacturing sectors will need and when they will need them and where the best economic gains are in the chain of production of batteries,” the Strategy says. 
“This includes considering policy options that enable domestic supply of Australian critical minerals for Australian projects. The form and remit of any future approach must be tailored to the specific needs of the Australian economy within the global context.”
Like the federal government’s recent EV Strategy, this reads more like plan to make a plan, rather than an actual plan.

Somewhat alarmingly, the strategy also notes: “Foreign companies are securing ownership and offtake arrangements for a large share of Australian minerals, particularly lithium and rare earth elements. In this context, Australian processors and manufacturers may struggle to access supplies of Australian minerals in future. This would affect our strategic and energy security.”
The sole solution offered to this predicament is “encouraging collaboration with, and attracting investment from, global firms that have developed and proven their IP [intellectual property] overseas.” To that end, the government has allocated $57.1 million to secure strategic and commercial partnerships, but again does not include any guidance on what an attractive partnership might entail.
The strategy’s other five focus areas include:
The strategy is clearly aware of the past social and environmental misdeeds of Australia’s mining industries and the deep distrust these have rooted among communities, especially First Nations Australians. One of the key actions the strategy highlights is the need to work with state and territories to “improve community sentiment” on the mining industry.
Image: Mineral Resources Limited
The strategy talks at length about the need for better First Nations engagement, but again most of the key actions include developing frameworks which will fall under reforms to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), expected to happen this year.
While there has been much excitement about these reforms engendering a federal Environment Protection Agency or EPA, some have raised concerns that they place too much power in the hands of ministers, with little ability to challenge those decisions. Details on the reforms are still in the making.
It is worth noting here that Australia’s critical minerals will need to be virgin mined from now until the foreseeable future, and this process often involves clearing native forests. With much of this mining happening in Western Australia, news outlet WAToday recently noted that prospectors have sought exploration and mining permits across more than 1 million hectares of farm land and native forest in the southern half of the state in the six months from late 2022 to early 2023 alone. 
This is to say, to reach this mineral superpower status, mining industries in Australia will grow considerably.
Meanwhile, a recent report from the Jubilee Australia Research Centre warned the race to capitalise on “staggering” material demand could see Australia dig up more critical minerals than necessary.

The massive environmental impact from mining critical minerals is often overlooked by its primary customers: the renewable energy equipment industries. These impacts also extend to mineral processing – with Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners co-founder and Managing Partner, David Scaysbrook, last year raising the question of whether Australia actually has the stomach to become a critical minerals superpower.
“Onshore processing of critical minerals is fantastic from a job creation perspective, it’s fantastic from a value add economic stimulus point of view, but some of these processes do have significant environmental impacts,” Scaysbrook said at a briefing last November.
He added that countries like China are able to embrace “some of the more impactful processes” on the environment, processes which, historically, Australia has baulked at.
As it stands, these questions have barely made their way into Australia’s mainstream media, let alone national discussions. At some stage, the paradox of destroying forests to save the planet with decarbonisation technologies will almost undoubtedly appear.
The federal government is set to review its Critical Minerals Strategy in 2026.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/21/inside-the-impacts-of-soiling/,"RESEARCH,INDIA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JUNE 21, 2023",Inside the impacts of soiling,"From pv magazine Global
Dust, bird droppings and other materials accumulating on the surface of PV modules in the field already amount to billions of dollars each year in lost energy output and added cleaning costs. So understanding how different site and installation conditions affect the build up of dust and droppings on a module surface is valuable knowledge for the PV industry.
A group of scientists led by the Vellore Institute of Technology in Tamil Nadu, India, had this in mind when they came up with a simple yet effective way to study the effects of different types of soiling on PV modules. The scientists gathered samples of five different types of soil (black soil, desert soil, red soil, alluvial soil, laterite soil) as well as coal dust and bird droppings, from various locations in India. The samples, in different amounts ranging from 10g to 50g, were then shaken and brushed onto the surface of PV modules, and the modules were tested using a sun simulator.
The results showed that at all tilt angles, bird droppings had the largest impact on module performance, with the 50g sample taking away more than 80% of the modules’ efficiency – a considerably larger loss than any of the dust or soil samples caused.
The study also found that the physical properties of the soiling material play a larger role than the angle of the modules in deciding the soiling rate. The results are discussed in full in the paper Experimental analysis on the impacts of soil deposition and bird droppings on the thermal performance of photovoltaic panels, published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering.
The group says that its study will help contribute to a better overall understanding of the effects of soiling on PV modules. This knowledge could help project developers better assess site conditions and avoid locating a project in regions where soiling will be particularly heavy, or ensuring that appropriate mitigation measures can be included from the start.
They note, however, that the results of this study can only be applied to regions with a hot, dry climate similar to Vellore in India on which the simulation conditions were based – Further, climate-specific studies are needed to draw similar conclusions for other climate types.
