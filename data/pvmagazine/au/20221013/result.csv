The $21 million Series A funding round was led by the CSIRO’s venture capital outfit Main Sequence Ventures and the federally funded Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), with the latter confirming it had invested $7 million through its innovation fund managed by Virescent Ventures.
The raise also includes existing investors Blackbird Ventures and software billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures while former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and Canva co-founder Cameron Adams also participated in the latest round.
SunDrive’s patented technology uses copper as the conductive material to pull the electrical current from the PV cells, instead of the industry standard silver. The technology has already produced solar efficiency world records, further expanding its commercial potential.

Worldwide, the solar PV industry consumes approximately 10% of the world’s silver and the manufacture of solar panels is estimated to account for 20% of total industrial demand.
“People in the scientific community have realised for a very long time that silver is unsustainable,” SunDrive co-founder Vince Allen said.
“The solar cells needed to decarbonize the world will need to be more efficient, cheaper and scalable than they are today. The use of silver is the common denominator and is holding back the rapid advancements needed to transition to a solar-powered electric world.”
Virescent Ventures managing partner Ben Gust said at nearly 100 times cheaper than silver and far more abundant, the switch to copper has the potential to improve solar panel uptake by driving down costs.
“Increasing panel efficiency and shifting to more abundant materials before constraints on silver and other materials limit industry growth is critical to improving the uptake of solar PV in Australia and around the world,” he said. “SunDrive’s technology has the potential to be the leading method for silver replacement in solar PV production.”
The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that solar PV generation capacity will more than double by the end of the decade, from approximately 739 GW in 2020, to up to 2,550 GW in 2030.
CEFC chief executive Ian Learmonth said SunDrive’s technology has the capacity to not only revolutionise the production of PV cells but also play a key role in the development of a domestic solar manufacturing industry.
“The technology has the potential to revolutionise the onshore production of solar cells and the development of an Australian solar manufacturing industry,” he said, adding “improving sovereign manufacturing capability will increase Australia’s resilience to supply chain disruptions and further enable the uptake of solar PV.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/13/energyaustralia-reveals-plan-for-new-500-mw-big-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 13, 2022",EnergyAustralia reveals plan for new 500 MW big battery,"EnergyAustralia has strengthened it plans to transition out of coal, announcing it is considering installing a grid-scale 500 MW battery energy storage system (BESS) at its Mt Piper coal-powered station near Lithgow in central western New South Wales (NSW).
EnergyAustralia said the battery, which could be operational by the end of 2026, could power more than 200,000 homes for up to four hours during times of high demand.
“This project forms part of our strategy to bring in new forms of dispatchable capacity into the system, to complement increasing renewable generation, and support the future of energy security in NSW as coal generation retires,” the company said.
EnergyAustralia’s head of development Daniel Nugent said the big battery, which is in its initial feasibility stage, could provide significant benefits in the state’s clean energy transition.
“The project would support future energy security in NSW as coal generation retires and more renewables enter the system,” he said. “The BESS would be a welcome addition to the state’s growing list of big clean energy storage projects. If approved, it will also provide an economic boost to the Central West region and help to transform it into a renewable energy hub.”
Nugent said co-locating the battery adjacent to the existing power generation site will allow the company to utilise existing infrastructure and avoid the need to construct new overhead power lines.
EnergyAustralia, which is owned by Hong Kong-based CLP Group, said the project will now undergo further assessments and community consultation as well as seeking approval through the NSW planning process. If approved, the battery could be operational by the end of 2026.
The development will only heighten speculation about the future of the Mt Piper coal-fired power plant which EnergyAustralia has announced will close in 2040 as part of its transition to clean energy and commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

The Mt Piper plant was previously scheduled to close in 2042 but EnergyAustralia last year announced plans to transition out of coal entirely by 2040, noting at the time that the final closure date for the power station was conditional.
“The final closure date for Mt Piper will be dependent on factors such as fuel supply arrangements, alternative dispatchable capacity in place, and decisions of other investors,” the company said at the time.
If the Mt Piper BESS project goes ahead, it would be EnergyAustralia’s largest battery storage project.
EnergyAustralia, which is also investigating the feasibility of developing a pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) facility at Lake Lyell near the Mt Piper site, has also announced plans to install a 350 MW/1.4 GWh battery in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley where its Yallourn coal mine and power station are set to close in 2028.
The gen-tailer has also partnered with renewables developer Edify Energy on two battery storage projects being developed in south-west NSW. Due for completion during the summer of 2023/24, the Darlington Point and Riverina battery energy storage projects are part of an energy storage system with a combined 150 MW/300 MWh of storage capacity spread over three individual but co-located assets.
Under a long-term services agreement, EnergyAustralia will have market control of two of the projects – the Riverina (65MW/130MWh) and Darlington Point (25MW/50MWh), for at least 10 years.
EnergyAustralia already operates two utility-scale battery storage systems in Victoria, a standalone 30 MW/30 MWh big battery located at the Ballarat terminal station and a 25 MW/50 MWh co-located with the Gannawarra Solar Farm battery.

The feasibility study will be undertaken by ITM Power – which operates the world’s largest electrolyser factory in the U.K. with a capacity of 1 GW per annum – and the Australian arm of multinational chemical and construction firm Linde Engineering.
The study will aim to identify the optimal site for a potential electrolyser manufacturing plant as well as the costs involved and whether there is likely to be enough local demand to sustain an upstream renewable hydrogen component manufacturing industry.
Global forecasts project the demand for electrolysers capacity will increase from 0.3 GW today, to close to 850 GW by 2030, and almost 3,600 GW by 2050. In WA, generation capacity is expected to reach as much as 100 GW by the end of the decade.
The state has already attracted a swathe of large-scale green hydrogen developments, including an $87 million project being pursued by ammonia producer Yara and the Australian arm of French renewables giant Engie. The Pilbara facility will use 18 MW of solar PV coupled with an 8 MW/5 MWh lithium-ion battery energy storage system to power a 10 MW electrolyser – which would be eight times the size of the country’s current biggest electrolyser.

WA Hydrogen Industry minister Alannah MacTiernan said the feasibility study will allow the state to better position itself in the renewable hydrogen supply chain and is an important step towards the state establishing itself as global hub for hydrogen production.
“Developing WA’s advanced manufacturing capability to produce critical components for renewable hydrogen production just makes good sense – it will increase the resilience of our future hydrogen supply chains,” she said.
“Funding this feasibility study is the first step toward manufacturing components for renewable hydrogen within the state. We want to be part of the full technology story in hydrogen.”
The WA government will contribute $225,000 towards the cost of the study, with the money drawn from its $1.25 billion Climate Action Fund.
Electrolyser manufacturing is a key initiative in the WA Renewable Hydrogen Strategy and ITM managing director William Thompson said the state government is looking to lead the way in Australia in the manufacture of the equipment needed to produce renewable hydrogen.
“This sensible approach can deliver jobs and supply chain opportunities in the state and we are pleased to be working with the government on this first step,” he said.

This is certainly true of the Finniss Lithium Project in Darwin, owned by Core Lithium. It is Australia’s first lithium mine outside of Western Australia and its opening comes just one year after construction began.
The project is aiming to produce around 16 million tonnes of lithium-bearing ore over the mine’s 12-year life expectancy, primarily for overseas exports with a focus on Asia.

By early next year, 2023, Finniss Lithium Project’s concentrator facilities are expected to be operational, producing lithium concentrate that will be of “battery-grade” – a high enough quality to be used in electric vehicles (EVs) and the big batteries increasingly deployed to store renewable energy generated throughout the day.
In April 2021, the ASX-listed Core Lithium announced the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) completed test work from a sample of its product from the Finniss site, successfully extracting over 95% of lithium on two kilogram samples of blended concentrate in two separate tests.
Australia is already the world’s largest lithium supplier, though both governments and industry appear to be putting increasing emphasis on moving beyond our global “quarry” status to establish more battery material processing facilities onshore to capture the full value chain of the expanding industry. 

The demand for lithium has grown so rapidly the prospect of global shortages have already began to cause panic, leading companies scrambling to shore up supplies.
From day one of operations, the Darwin mine already had the vast majority of its output secured through binding offtake agreements with China’s Ganfeng Lithium and Sichuan Yahua to supply 75,000 tonnes per annum of lithium concentrate to each company over four years.
The project also has a legally binding Term Sheet agreement with Tesla for four years to supply 110,000 tonnes of lithium spodumene concentrate.

The flagship project is situated in what the company described as “one of the most prospective areas for lithium in the NT,” the Bynoe Pegmatite Field.
Core Lithium has been granted tenements – effectively a claim, lease or licence to the area – for massive tracts sitting in total at 500 square kilometres.
The company is actively continuing its exploration in the Bynoe Pegmatite Field, ultimately looking to grow the project’s scope, Core Lithium’s non-executive chairman, Greg English, told the ABC.
The scope of these granted tenements and the prospects of extension have caused alarm among some of the community.
Lithium mining and minerals processing has long been contentious, criticised for its hefty environmental impacts. Given Australia has among the world’s largest lithium deposits, and lithium batteries remain the primary storage chemistry used today, it seems fairly likely lithium projects in Australia will grow considerably.

Members of the Northern Territory government have described the Finniss Lithium Project as “just the beginning.”
“Our government has established the Mineral Development Taskforce to investigate and identify policies and strategies to accelerate private investment in mining projects just like this one,” Minister for Mining and Industry Nicole Manison said.
The global battery market is expected to grow nine to 10 times by 2030 and 40-fold by 2050, according to the Future Battery Cooperative. This would equate to roughly $23 trillion (USD 14.25 trillion) being spent on the technology before 2050.

Australia is home to all the raw materials required to make todays high performance batteries including lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese and graphite. Until now, battery material refining and processing has tended to be done in developing countries, with China easily holding the lion’s share.
Western Australia is rapidly embracing downstream processing for batteries though. Earlier this year, Australian miner IGO and China’s Tianqi produced its first batch of battery grade lithium hydroxide at its Kwinana refinery in WA.
Mineral sands miner Iluka Resources have also begun construction on the first rare earth oxide refinery, the Eneabba Rare Earths Refinery, this year.

APG has, on behalf of its pension fund client ABP, agreed to acquire a 49% equity ownership in the 690 MW solar PV farm and 380 MW/1,416 MWh battery energy storage project being developed outside of Las Vegas.
APG’s America managing director Steve Hanson said Gemini will be the fund manager’s largest single solar and storage investment to date.
“As a responsible investor, we are always looking for infrastructure investments that bring long-term financial returns for our pension clients and that have positive environmental and social impacts,” he said. “This transaction represents an opportunity to invest in a “state-of-the-art energy project”.
Quinbrook, which has an extensive portfolio of energy assets in Australia, said APG had been chosen as an equity partner after the Brisbane-based company had received multiple offers from prospective investors, noting that APG is an experienced investor in renewables with several direct investments in utility-scale solar and storage assets in the U.S.
“We are very excited to welcome APG as a partner to Quinbrook and Primergy as we advance construction of such a milestone project for U.S. clean energy,” Quinbrook co-founder and managing partner David Scaysbrook.
“Given the scale and impact of Gemini, we felt APG was an exemplary partner for us that is differentiated by its sophisticated approach to the Gemini project and to the US renewables market more generally.”
Scaysbrook said Primergy will continue to manage the construction and operational phases of Gemini which is currently the largest solar and storage project under construction in the U.S. and recently closed a record-breaking USD 1.9 billion tax equity and debt financing.
Gemini is scheduled to start operating in 2023, generating enough clean energy to power more than 400,000 homes during peak periods and displacing 1.5 million metric tons of carbon emissions annually.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/13/off-grid-solar-continues-to-expand/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NORTHERN AFRICA,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"OCTOBER 13, 2022",Off-grid solar continues to expand,"From pv magazine Global
Despite the pressure the pandemic has placed on supply chains and income levels, the number of people who source electricity from solar energy kits has continued to grow and has now reached 490 million.
According to the “Off-Grid Solar Market Trends Report 2022: State of The Sector” report – published by the World Bank’s Lighting Global, International Finance Corp. (IFC), GOGLA, Efficiency for Access Coalition, and Open Capital Advisors – the number of people who use solar energy kits had grown by 70 million by the end of 2021, up from 420 million in 2019.
The report attributes this result to continued sales, the longer lifespan of larger products, and current customers beginning to move up the “clean energy staircase.” This is where they have paid off or made savings from their initial solar energy kit and are able to purchase a new, often larger product and additional services. For instance, 3.8 million customers have gained access to solar TVs in 2020 and 2021.
The adverse effects of the pandemic were most pronounced in 2020, translating into a 22% decline in solar energy kit sales. However, in 2021, the off-grid solar sector bounced back with a 10% increase in sales, the report finds.
In pursuit of universal energy access by 2030, off-grid solar technologies are expected to play a critical role as population growth, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the report, off-grid solar represents the cheapest solution for 41% of new household connections between 2020 and 2030.
But for many homes and businesses, the price of solar energy kits remains prohibitive. The pandemic has also exacerbated the affordability challenge in the form of declining income levels and job losses. Therefore, the availability of consumer financing options, such as PAYGo, has never been more important.
Assuming consumer finance is readily available, between 177 million to 277 million currently unconnected people are still unable to afford a Tier 1 solar energy kit, the report shows. In the absence of consumer finance, affordability levels drop even further. That is to say, of 733 million unconnected people around the world, only between 3 million and 167 million could afford to buy a Tier 1 multi-light and charging system upfront.
“This indicates that end-user financing is essential to provide the poorest population with Tier 1 energy access, but that PAYGo is not sufficient to close the affordability gap,” the report said.
Meanwhile, investments into the industry continued to grow, surpassing USD 2.3 billion ($3.6b) since 2012. However, most of the finance went to seven companies operating at scale, while those in their seed and start-up phase have found attracting financing more difficult.
From 2016 to 2020, the industry saw yearly investment volumes plateauing between USD 300 million and USD 350 million, before reaching USD 457 million in 2021. This year is set to be another record-breaking year, the report states.
In other findings, the report found that solar water pumps and solar cooling seen as “emerging” technologies two years ago, have rapidly matured and are now classified as “near-to-market” – and are already improving food production and storage. Furthermore, the PAYGo technology that unlocked consumer financing for solar energy is now being leveraged on a variety of electronic devices, and to offer digital financial services.
Finally, the report highlights the need for end-user subsidies, noting that “there is growing recognition that more public funding will be needed to reach remote and lower-income customers, and to bridge affordability gaps.”
