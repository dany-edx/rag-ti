And even after peaking, annual investment is forecast to remain at about $9 billion a year until at least 2032.
Sydney-based Macromonitor said its Renewable Energy Construction Outlook report – which analyses the Australian renewable energy construction sector, including solar, wind and battery energy storage – reveals a “remarkable surge” in renewable construction in Australia.
The report shows that the sector experienced a 37% increase in construction activity in 2021/22, and Macromonitor anticipates even stronger growth rates of 49% in 2022/23 and 31% in 2023/24.
By 2025/26, the company is forecasting that annual investment in the sector will reach an all-time peak of $11.8 billion in construction work done, in constant 2020/21 prices, more than double the previous peak of $5.5 billion recorded in 2018/19.
“Our estimates show that the renewable energy sector in Australia entered its third phase of growth in 2022, and this upward trend is expected to continue for the next few years with an expected peak in 2025/26,” the consultancy said.

Macromonitor said after reaching that peak, construction activities are expected to decline for the next few years but predicts “they will stay at an historically high level.”
“We expect average annual work done to be around $9 billion for the rest of forecast period, supported by the large projects later in the forecast period,” it said.
Macromonitor said the surge is being driven by several factors including the federal government’s commitment to emissions reduction; the deployment of large-scale battery storage systems; the development of new transmission infrastructure to support renewable energy zones; and state-specific renewable energy targets.
The consultancy said the closure of several coal-fired power stations between 2023 and 2035 is also sparking greater investment in renewable electricity generation.
The report shows that investment in wind and solar energy projects take up a large proportion of renewable construction activity in Australia’s overall construction portfolio with the solar sector’s total value of work done predicted to hit its highest point of $3.6 billion in 2024.
Construction of large-scale battery storage in Australia is estimated at $1.2 billion this year and is expected to rise to $1.8 billion each year between 2024 and 2026.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/03/altech-reveals-1-mwh-sodium-chloride-battery-gridpack-design/,"ENERGY STORAGE,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,GERMANY,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 3, 2023",Altech reveals 1 MWh sodium chloride battery GridPack design,"Perth-based Altech Batteries has, as part of its joint venture collaboration with German research organisation Fraunhofer IKTS, unveiled the design of a new 1 MWh GridPack non-lithium battery energy storage system for the renewable energy and grid storage market.
The launch of the “plug and play” GridPack comes just six months after the two companies entered a joint venture agreement to commercialise Fraunhofer’s Cerenergy sodium alumina solid state battery technology which relies on sodium ions commonly found in table salt and avoids using rare and expensive metals such as lithium, cobalt, graphite and copper.
Altech said the technology eliminates exposure to critical metal price rises and supply chain concerns while German government-owned Fraunhofer has estimated that the cost of producing Cerenergy batteries should be in the region of 40% cheaper than lithium-ion batteries which currently dominate the global energy storage market.
The joint venture is commercialising the sodium chloride battery technology, with plans to construct a 100 MWh production facility on Altech’s land in Germany. It is anticipated the facility will produce 10,000 individual 10 kWh Cerenergy battery modules each year to provide grid storage solutions to the market.
While the development of the manufacturing facility continues, the companies have now launched the design of the 1.0 MWh GridPack.
Each GridPack, to be housed in a standard shipping container, will comprise up to 20 individual 60 kWh battery packs connected to a power management system. Each unit will have a distinct rating of 600 v (dc) and 100 amp hours and will be able to be arranged in a series to achieve the required rating of several thousand kW for grid functioning.
Altech said the GridPacks are modular and stackable, which reduces their footprint, and have a “plug and play” feature that makes them easy to install in remote locations.

The company said there are no moving parts such as cooling fans and the batteries can operate in any climate without need for thermal management – a key advantage of sodium-alumina solid state batteries over lithium-ion alternatives.
“These 1 MWh GridPacks will offer significant benefits for the fast-growing renewable energy and grid storage sectors,” the company said. “They are an excellent means of stabilising the grid by providing a source of backup power during  periods of  high demand or when renewable energy sources are not producing at capacity.”
“They are also a cost-effective solution for storing and distributing renewable energy across a variety of applications, including grid-scale storage, microgrids, and electric vehicle charging.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/03/wa-points-to-esperance-initiative-as-energy-transition-blueprint-for-australia/,"POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 3, 2023",WA points to Esperance initiative as energy transition ‘blueprint’ for Australia,"Western Australian regional energy provider Horizon Power said Esperance has successfully transitioned to electric power through a unique initiative that paves the way for a renewable energy future for the town in the state’s southeast.
State government-owned Horizon said the Esperance Gas Distribution Company (EDGC), the owner and operator of the area’s gas network, on Friday stopped supplying reticulated gas to the residences and businesses in the community.
Horizon said the majority of the town’s private residential and business customers have already made the switch from reticulated gas to an alternative energy source, with most electing for a full or partial electrification solution, “delivering increased energy efficiency and lower emissions.”
The shift is part of the Esperance Energy Transition Plan, announced in 2021 after EDGC revealed that it would not continue to supply gas and operate the reticulated gas network after the state government awarded a long-term gas supply agreement to EVOL LNG, which planned to truck gas to Esperance from Perth.
Horizon, which acts as both utility and network operator in WA outside of the state’s more populous southwest, decided that converting current reticulated gas customers to alternative longer-term energy solutions would offer the greatest benefits for customers and the broader community, with the least risks.
The transition initiative, backed by $10.5 million in state government funding, offered financial assistance for existing gas customers to remove their gas appliances and replace them with new ‘like for like’ electric alternatives to replace existing gas units, including installation costs and electrical work.
Businesses were also offered free independent energy audits, with a grant scheme providing financial support for their chosen transition pathway.
WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston said the electrification of Esperance sets a benchmark for the rest of the country and will accelerate the state’s ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
“This is a significant milestone for the state, demonstrating the first electrification of its kind for Australia,” he said. “This project will serve as a blueprint for other electrification works around the country.”
Horizon said a small number of customers in Esperance will make the transition to electricity in the coming months while some businesses have made the commercial decision to postpone that transition and will rely instead on bottled gas.

Esperance’s shift to electricity has been supported by the development of a hybrid renewable energy hub that brings together solar and wind power and meets almost half of the town’s annual electricity demand.
The Shark Lake Renewables Hub includes a 4 MW solar farm combined with two 4.5 MW wind turbines integrated with a 4 MW lithium-ion battery energy storage system backed by gas generators.
The integrated power system, which is owned and operated by Perth-based Contract Power, has been operating since mid-2022, generating up to 46% of Esperance’s electricity demands.
“This is a long-term solution delivering cleaner electricity by reducing the carbon footprint and increasing the generation of renewable energy for the community,” Horizon said.
“Solar and wind power are an ideal way to combine renewable energy sources. During the day, a solar farm captures energy from the sun, and after dark is when the wind farm is most active. Combined, these two energy sources allow electricity to be generated by renewables around the clock.”

“OX2 has identified considerable potential for value creation in Esco Pacific through extension of the product offering from sale of project rights to the sale of turnkey solutions at construction start,” the company said in a statement.
“OX2 plans to scale up operations through acquisitions in solar and energy storage and has the ambition to expand operations to onshore wind while exploring offshore wind and hydrogen.”
Currently owned by international energy major Shell, founder and Managing Director Steve Rademaker and private investors, Esco has already delivered more than 800 MW of large-scale projects since its inception in 2015.
The Melbourne-based company also has a project development portfolio of approximately 1.4 GW across the National Electricity Market (NEM), comprising 1,220 MW solar and 200 MW of energy storage, and is the asset manager for a 530 MW portfolio of operational utility-scale solar projects.
Rademaker, who has agreed to stay with the company for two years, initially as managing director and thereafter as an advisor, said the deal paves the way for Esco’s continued growth.
“We have found a great buyer for ESCO Pacific,” he said. “OX2 is a strong player with excellent track record, and they will no doubt have the ability to significantly grow the footprint in Australia.”
Esco’s completed projects include the 148 MW Ross River, 75 MW Childers and 95 MW Susan River solar farms in Queensland, and the 175 MW Finley solar farm in NSW. The 140 MW Glenrowan, 110 MW Moura and 70 MW Wyalong are currently under construction while the 110 MW Rollingstone, 85 MW Dingo, 60 MW Mirani, 55 MW Koberinga, 80 MW Mulwala, 100 MW Sandigo, 100 MW Lancaster, 90 MW Summerville, and 135 MW Muswellbrook solar farms are under development.
OX2 Chief Executive Officer Paul Stormoen said the transaction aligns with the Swedish company’s expansion strategy which includes a focus on “markets with a significant share of fossil energy and clear needs and opportunities to increase the proportion of renewable energy.”
“I am very happy to announce our entry into the Australian market and to welcome an experienced local team to OX2,” he said. “Through this transaction, we get an attractive development portfolio in a growing renewables market, while also significantly strengthening our capabilities within solar and energy storage.”
“This gives us a solid foundation for profitable expansion in Australia.”
Founded in 2004, Stockholm-headquartered OX2 is a leading player in the European renewables space with a project development portfolio of more than 28 GW, including a construction portfolio in excess of 1.3 GW with a strong focus on wind energy.
Its acquisition of Esco is priced at $126 million. In addition, there is a contingent consideration amounting to up to $17 million to the founder based on sales and margins in 2025-2027 from the acquired project development portfolio.
The transaction remains subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions but OX2 said it expects the deal will be finalised by the end of April.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/03/chinese-module-prices-to-fall-by-15-from-q4-2022-to-q4-2023-says-cea/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,CHINA",LÍVIA NEVES,"APRIL 3, 2023","Chinese module prices to fall by 15% from Q4 2022 to Q4 2023, says CEA","The latest PV price forecast from CEA predicts that module prices in China will fall by about 15% from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2023, as polysilicon prices continue to slide.
The engineering consultancy said that from 2023 to 2024, TOPCon prices will remain higher than PERC.
“As many new cell lines are ramping up that will need to calibrate, limiting the growth in TOPCon availability,” said CEA.
However, it added that it expects the price difference between the two technologies to narrow down from 2024, “as TOPCon becomes the default utility-scale module.” Nevertheless, the firm noted that it expects some price gap to remain between TOPCon and PERC, “as growing TOPCon adoption will cause PERC to be offered at an increasingly discounted rate until it is retired.”
The corresponding graph from the report shows that by the first quarter of 2025, monofacial, backsheet TOPCon modules will cost the same as bifacial double-glass PERC modules with 210 mm cells. Between the first quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, module prices in China will drop by an average of 6%, according to the report.
Global PV manufacturing capacity across the supply chain will experience rapid growth from 2022 to 2027, according to CEA, with capacities doubling in the ingot/wafer stages and potentially quadrupling for polysilicon. This capacity will remain heavily concentrated in China, said CEA.
Equipment oversupply, as measured by nominal industry production capacity compared to new facilities, is expected to increase from 25% in 2022 to 100% in 2027. That is, the industry as a whole will be able to produce twice as much as demand, according to projections.
By 2023, global module production capacity are set to exceed 800 GW per year, while global installations will likely stay above 300 GW. By 2027, module production capacity could exceed 1,000 GW per year, while installations should be near 500 GW.
The most immediate impact of the capacity increase on the market is a tripling of polysilicon capacity from 2022 to 2024, based on new capacity under construction or already in the start-up and ramp-up phases.
CEA’s projections are the result of a specially developed modeling system to provide independent market intelligence on changes in global supply chains and accurate forecasts for supply price scenarios based on technologies, materials, manufacturing regions, and target markets, as well as supply and demand forecasts.
