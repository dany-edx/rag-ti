Managed by AEMO Services, the tender is set to open on October 4 and run until October 28. 
The state requires bidding projects to achieve commercial operation by January 2025, while the long-duration storage projects are to be up and running by the beginning of 2027. 
The state government has also supplied a draft tender pack to give industry a clear idea of criteria, which include stipulations about community engagement and benefits, regional jobs and land use considerations.
Since enacting its NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap, the government said more than 3.6 GW of energy investment has been committed or ‘anticipated’ across NSW. “AEMO Services expect nearly all of these projects to be eligible to participate,” the government’s press release said.
“Many, many more projects have also sufficiently progressed through the development pipeline and are likely to be eligible.”
Projects across the state will be able to participate for “Long-Term Energy Service Agreements” – a scheme the government is using to underwrite projects by providing financial security. 
While renewable energy zones are a cornerstone of the state’s roadmap, only Access Rights for the Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone, in the state’s north-west, will open in this tender round.
While the desired size of the tender round is 2,500 GWh for annual generation and 600 MW of long-duration storage, more or less generation and storage will be considered if it is “in the long-term financial interests of NSW electricity consumers to do so.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/06/queensland-company-capturing-biogas-from-landfills-launches-ipo-to-expand-battery-play/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2022",Queensland company capturing biogas from landfills launches IPO to expand battery play,"LGI Limited currently operates 26 projects on Australian landfills, seven of which generate energy by capturing biogas, mostly methane, emitted from the sites and converting it using a genset.
Listing on the Australia Stock Exchange or ASX, the company is currently holding an IPO (Initial public offering) to raise $25 million – money it plans to put towards expanding its operations, including adding battery storage to its projects. 
“The beauty for us is we’ve got a 24 hour a day fuel source so we can recharge all the time,” LGI’s Managing Director and Founder Adam Bloomer tells pv magazine Australia.
LGI estimates there are more than 200 landfill sites in Australia that could support biogas projects, with the company commissioning a new site in Toowoomba, southern Queensland, next month and developing another in Nowra on the New South Wales south coast for 2023.

To date, most of LGI’s projects have been on sites owned by local councils across Queensland, New South Wales and the capital territory.
The broad umbrella of bioenergy holds a wide range of ‘renewable’ generation approaches of varying contention, something not lost on Bloomer. While LGI has been approached about generating renewable natural gas, or RNG, it isn’t a path Bloomer deems particularly promising.
First off, it takes enormous amounts of biogas to make RNG, he says, and it isn’t a particularly efficient way of generating energy, especially since, secondly, everything is already electrifying.
Burning plant matter, another form of bioenergy classed as renewable, has also come under renewed scrutiny in Australia. A Senate committee last week proposed the government amend a the Climate Change Bill 2022 to exclude electricity generated from native forest wood waste as being classified ‘renewable’.

Whether bioenergy could even be significant contributor to Australia’s power mix, as report ‘Australia’s Bioenergy Roadmap’ prepared by Deloitte and Enea suggested, Bloomer finds questionable. “You would have to be cropping,” Bloomer says. “Unless it’s a waste stream, it doesn’t make sense to me.”
While Australia’s use, or rather overuse, of landfill sites is certainly no cause for celebration, Bloomer’s approach is pragmatic. “Australia will continue to rely on landfills for the foreseeable future and there is an increasing need to manage their emissions,” he says.
“Whether we’re there or not, that methane was going to come out of that site.”
In terms of what LGI actually does at its project sites depends on the amount of gas the particular landfill emits. Firstly the company begins by running a network of pipes and wells into the landfill and applying a vacuum to pull the gas towards the wells.

“Before we put a power generator on a site, we have to prove there’s enough gas there to make the investment, so we flare before we do that – we combust the gas essentially,” Bloomer explains.
If there is a viable amount of rotting things down there, LGI will bring in its specialised biogas generators. “They’re just big internal combustion engines really that are optimised for landfill gas or biogas,” Bloomer says.
“In a perfect world, you’d capture the CO2 that comes off the engine and sequester it but the technology just isn’t there to make it commercially viable at the moment.”
In terms of the generation form’s renewable classification, Bloomer says: “by the definition of renewable, it’s actually not.”
“It’s a green energy, but it falls under the renewable energy banner.”
Bloomer says LGI has been working on integrating batteries into its project for a number of years – but, like many, had been waiting for the prices to drop. 
The batteries won’t increase the MWh from LGI’s sites, but will rather afford the capacity to seize high prices for five minute intervals when they occur on the spot market.

“Whereas we might have a 1 MW site now, we can stick 4 MW worth of batteries on it and have an instantaneous output of 5 MW on those sites,” Bloomer says.
LGI has also developed its own control system and algorithm for the batteries in house, a component Bloomer says is important because its tailored to the generation type and energy source of their projects – which are markedly different from wind and solar.
While not initially sold on Tesla, the US giant won favour with Blommer who says the company has proved flexible to deal with and among the best value.
Not all landfill sites have enough gas to justify power generation, Bloomer says. “Or they’re not close enough to the network to make it viable.” In those cases, LGI simply converts the methane to CO2 by flaring it.
“Methane on its own has a massive global warming potential – its 28 times that of CO2 – so by combusting it, we’re reducing the greenhouse gas effectiveness.”

“That’s a pretty significant part of our business and one we’re going to keep growing. They’re good projects and low hanging fruit – lots of emissions reductions for not a massive outlay.”
Asked if there’s any alternative for the methane, Bloomer says: “unfortunately no” – not besides capturing and bottling it. “But it would cost you $400 to fill up a BBQ gas bottle so it doesn’t make a lot of sense.”
LGI makes a portion of its income from electricity generation, with other streams coming from the government backed Large-Scale Generation Certificates or LGCs, as well as Australian Carbon Credits Units, or ACCUs.
Australia’s carbon credit system has gone from scandal to scandal in the last year, with the new Labor government recently calling a review into the sector – a move Bloomer warmly welcomed.
“I think there’s room for improvement in the methodology we operate under and that’s what we’ll put forward to Ian Chubb and the like.”
“It should be fairly simply to calculate how many ACCUs you’re going to make over a period of time and what your baseline is going to be, and at the moment it’s just not simple,” Bloomer says. “And some of that complexity has come through lobbying.”

Bloomer blames historic decisions on some of the sector’s disrepute – saying its a shame landfill gas has come into question. “We have a flow meter that’s calibrated and if we’re audited, we can prove absolutely how much gas is being flowed and being destroyed. There’s not sort of assumptions,” he says.
“And also with landfill gas, there’s a continuing investment to continue creating ACCUs. We don’t just sort of spend money once and then sit back and collect ACCUs for 20 years.”
LGI’s IPO will run until September 23. 
After the float, 38% of shares on issue will be held by directors and management, with 43% owned by other existing shareholders and 19% offered to new shareholders through the IPO.

The supply is planned for the company’s flagship mine, New Century, north of Mount Isa and would go a small way to cutting its power generation carbon emissions.
The Mica Creek Solar Farm has been developed in two stages, the first 44 MW underpinned by a 15-year offtake agreement with another zinc miner MM Dugald River. Construction on the second stage, doubling the project’s capacity to 88 MW, began this year, with the full project expected to be operational by late FY23. 
The deal signed with New Century Resources is only in the form of a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), and requires New Century to amend its existing Power Purchase Agreement to include the new 8 MW of supply from Mica Creek Solar Farm by the end of the month.
Mica Creek’s stage two development is, however, already secured through a previously announced contract with Mt Isa Mines, a Glencore Australia company.
Darren Rogers, APA Group’s Executive for Strategy and Commercial, said the New Century deal is part of the APA’s plan to bring renewables to Queensland’s North West Minerals Province, a mining hub, to help the resource sector to decarbonise.

BMW Group said it is commencing in-house, small-scale production of fuel cells for its iX5 in Munich, Germany. The small series of hydrogen cars will enter service in the next four months for test and demonstration purposes, targeting the premium segment. The fuel cells generate a high continuous output of 125 kW/170 hp, paired with an electric motor featuring fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, and a battery that enables the powertrain to deliver 275 kW/374 hp. BMW has collaborated with Toyota Motor on fuel cells since 2013.
Topsoe has taken the final investment decision (FID) for the world’s largest SOEC electrolyser manufacturing plant in Herning, Denmark. Construction is expected to start within the second half. Its manufacturing capacity will be 500 MW per year, with an option to expand to 5 GW. CEO Roeland Baan said Topsoe is investing more than DKK 2 billion ($268.8 million) – “the single biggest investment in the company’s history.” It has 500 MW of pre-sold capacity and is talking to other potential off-take partners.
Bosch said it will produce fuel cell stacks at its facility in Anderson, South Carolina, as part of an investment of more than US$200 million (AU$292m). The first Bosch fuel-cell production facility in the United States will likely be commissioned in 2026. The German group said it will globally invest more than US$1 billion (AU$1.47b) to develop mobile fuel cell technologies by 2024. Several companies, including Nikola, have tested prototype Class 8 fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEV) featuring Bosch technology.
DNV has conducted a study on behalf of the NGO Clean Air Task Force (CATF) showing that the replacement of existing gray hydrogen production with low-carbon or green hydrogen alone could meet 60% of the Dutch industrial emissions target. The independent assurance provider said policies implemented to support carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the Netherlands have been successful in encouraging industrial decarbonisation, but noted that hydrogen (either blue or green) is not yet sufficiently incentivised by policy mechanisms to bring confidence to investors and industry.
H-TEC Systems said it will provide two ME450 PEM electrolysis systems to Gruyère Hydrogen Power (GHP). “In future, GHP will supply the green hydrogen to an international industrial company based in Switzerland,” wrote H-TEC Systems. The systems are set to start operations by the end of next year. The two ME450 PEM electrolysers have an electrical output of 1 MW each and will be supplied with green energy, predominantly from PV. The two facilities aim to produce up to 900 kilograms of green hydrogen per day.
The US Department of Energy (DoE) is seeking applications for projects in “Nuclear Coupled Hydrogen Production and Use.” The DoE said it aims to support the development of nuclear plant thermal integration required for high-temperature hydrogen production or hydrogen-coupled end uses for nuclear energy.
Nikola has announced that it will unveil the European Nikola Tre fuel-cell electric vehicle (FCEV) beta version on Sept. 19 with partner Iveco. The Nikola Tre FCEV, which has a range of up to 500 miles, is expected to enter serial production for the North American market in late 2023 and a few months later in Ulm, Germany. 
The Shanghai municipal government said it wants to turn Lingang, a newly carved-out area of Shanghai’s Pilot Free Trade Zone (FTZ), into a digital innovation center and hydrogen hub. The city’s Jiading district has also issued an implementation plan to develop hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, targeting an output of CNY 100 billion (AU$21.3 billion) by 2025. 
Air Products and Associated British Ports have announced their intention to partner in bringing the first large-scale, green hydrogen production facility to the United Kingdom.
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Siemens Energy, and 13 other entities have launched the Global Alliance for Industry Decarbonisation. The alliance will focus on renewables and other transition-related technologies like green hydrogen.

In a key milestone for its pumped-heat energy storage (PHES) technology, Malta Inc., a startup spun out of Google X, has announced that Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) has completed assembly and commissioning of a first-of-a-kind PHES demonstration facility.
Malta’s system stores electricity either directly from a power plant or from the grid. It does this by converting electricity into thermal energy (heat and cold). The heat is stored in molten salt, a proven method of storing thermal energy, and the cold is stored in an antifreeze-like solution with components and subsystems derived from the liquefied natural gas industry.
“The full-scale PHES system offers high potential system performance up to 60% round-trip efficiency and can store energy for more than 10 hours,” said SwRI Group Leader Dr. Natalie Smith, the project’s lead investigator. “PHES is a promising, versatile technology that can be applied to many different energy sources without geological or geographical restrictions.”
Under US Department of Energy (DoE) funding, SwRI has successfully commissioned the small-scale demonstration system that uses simple recuperated cycles for both modes of operation with air as the main working fluid. The facility is intended to demonstrate operation, verify system control strategies, and validate data.
While the SwRI pilot is laboratory-scale, a full-size Malta PHES system will be able to store more than 100 MW of power for eight hours to eight days or longer (1,000+ MWh). One such system is being developed in partnership with Siemens. As announced last year, the two companies are designing turbomachinery components that will support long-duration energy storage systems that could scale over time to the gigawatt range as well as a range of services that the PHES will be able to provide to grid operators, including synchronous inertia, reactive power, and fast ramping. 
In another project using a DoE grant, Malta has partnered with Duke Energy to assess the socio-economic, environmental, and operational issues behind converting retiring coal units into long-duration, zero-emissions energy storage systems.
The two companies said last year they would  look at integrating Malta’s 100 MW, 10-hour pumped heat energy storage system into existing infrastructure at a Duke Energy coal plant in North Carolina.
Malta has also garnered investment from physical commodities trader Trafigura and teamed up with engineering and construction company Bechtel to speed the rollout of long-duration energy storage.
