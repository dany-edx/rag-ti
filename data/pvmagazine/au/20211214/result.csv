Luckily, that crisis appears to have been staved off. While details have not yet been officially released, regulators are tomorrow expected to issue a six month delay to the changes which would have rendered the majority of inverters sold in Australia effectively unusable.
“It’s pure madness we’ve ended in this place,” John Grimes, Chief Executive of the Smart Energy Council, told pv magazine Australia. We are, seemingly, living in an incarnation of Terry Gilliam’s 1985 film Brazil.
Well, in November Australia dropped AS/NZS 5033, a much criticised standard which required rooftop solar installations to include a DC isolator. 
A new standard, AS/NZS 4777.2:2020, was then set to be brought in on December 18, 2021, to which industry was alerted in May. The new AS/NZS 4777.2:2020 standard basically aligned with international testing protocols but with one key exception: instead of testing DC inverters’ operating temperatures at 40°C, Australia demanded testing be done at 60°C.
Inverter manufacturers noted this and went about the business of getting their inverters tested at the increased temperature and everything looked fine. Inverters were tested, certificates issued, and equipment shipped. 
Where it all unravelled was when an audit of these new Australian certificates was done. Tracing them back to the overseas laboratory responsible for international testing, it found that while the lab was certified to issue certificates to the international standard, it was not certified to issue them for the new, amended Australia-specific standard. “As a result, [regulators] were like ‘this is fruit of a poison tree’ so therefore the whole chain here gets cut off,” Grimes said, meaning that every inverter issued these certificates (basically all of them) were suddenly not up to Australian standard and any household where they were installed would not be eligible for government rebates – so, naturally, they couldn’t be installed. 
“So all of the certificates that had been issued on the basis that the test had been done, they’d passed and been accepted, were stuck off the list,” Grimes said. According to him, that rendered around 80% of the inverters on the Australian market unusable, leaving only microinverters (which don’t need DC isolators), as well as some inverters from Fronius (Grimes isn’t sure how it managed to get valid certificates, but it did), as well as one model from GoodWe and Solis.

“This is a paperwork issue. It’s an issue of imagination, not reality,” Grimes added, noting that other brands of inverters are perfectly fine and up to international (and probably also Australian) standard, its just the certificates which prove it have been rendered void.
Who certifies the certifier?
Now, precisely who certifies the certifier is a complicated question, but it seems there are multiple bodies involved which compose a complicated bureaucratic web.
What’s important though is that when manufacturers were alerted to the fact their inverters’ certifications had been disqualified on a technicality, they found in fact there was no laboratory in the would which could to issue certifications to the new Australian standard. “That loop was never closed,” Grimes said, which left manufacturers high and dry, especially with the new standard coming into effect in a matter of weeks on December 18, 2021.
Why this loose end was neither spotted nor amended earlier is, as Grimes put it, is a “failing of the process.”
Somehow this bureaucratic bungle emerged to join a perfect storm. With Australia’s solar rebate set to fall, as always, in the new year, there tends to be an end of year rush on installations. Coupled with the ongoing supply chain disruptions leading to module price hikes and shortages, alongside global shipping chaos, it could not have come at a worse time.
After manufacturers found themselves at an impasse with regulators, the Smart Energy Council and the Clean Energy Council routed to a new tactic. In December, they went directly to state energy ministers and warned them this boring technical bungle could grid a very real industry to a halt.
It worked.
Tomorrow the Electrical Regulatory Authorities Council (ERAC) is expected to announce the new AS/NZS 4777.2:2020 standard will not come into effect until June 30, 2022, giving manufacturers and certifiers six months to fix the certification issue.
Only Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania are regulated by ERAC. New South Wales, for instance, is not a member. But Grimes is confident that regulators in other states – although they are officially separate bodies – will follow the same guidance. 
Ian Burgwin, Chair of ERAC, is expected to give the full details of the new inverter standards tomorrow, Wednesday December 15, at the Smart Energy Council’s webinar scheduled for 3.30pm.
In a statement issued on Tuesday, ERAC and the Standing Committee of Officials (SCO), which is responsible for managing and coordinating the Electrical Equipment Safety System (EESS) said:
The statement added the Clean Energy Council “has accepted this position and will not require further evidence than the above to enable solar PV inverters incorporating DC isolators to be able to be listed on the CEC list of compliant inverters and power conversion equipment (PCE) suitable for installation under the Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES).”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/14/hydrogen-powered-freight-trains-police-cars-queensland-goes-all-out/,"HYDROGEN,POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"DECEMBER 14, 2021",Hydrogen powered freight trains? Police cars? Queensland goes all out,"The Queensland government came out with two rather novel hydrogen announcements on Monday, saying Australia’s largest rail freight company, Aurizon, and global mining company Anglo American will undertake a feasibility study into using hydrogen fuel cell and battery hybrid power units for bulk rail freight operations.
The state government also commissioned Australia’s first hydrogen-powered police vehicle, assigning the North Brisbane Domestic and Family Violence Vulnerable Persons Unit a Hyundai Nexo fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV).
Hydrogen’s application in transport is still debated, with many experts predicting the technology is highly unlikely to overtake electric vehicles (EVs) for passenger cars and other light vehicles. Hydrogen does, however, seem to hold more promise for heavy transport vessels like ships and airplanes, though this too is still debated. Globalisation has made transport one of the fastest growing sectors for emissions – it accounts for around 14% of Queensland’s total emissions and 17% nationally. 
Queensland’s Minister for Energy Renewables and Hydrogen Mick de Brenni, however, seems to acknowledge in his statement on the news that the projects are less about a hydrogen technology coup and more about kickstarting domestic demand, creating an ecosystem for green hydrogen establish itself.
Headquartered in London, mining company Anglo American has been developing green hydrogen solutions for its ultra-class 290 tonne payload mine haul trucking fleet.
Its agreement with Aurizon, however, marks the first time its hydrogen fuel cell and battery hybrid power unit technologies have been tested outside the trucking program.
“The feasibility study will focus on the potential deployment of Anglo American’s hydrogen power technology on Aurizon’s Moura rail corridor and also the Mount Isa Rail corridor,” Queensland’s Deputy Premier and Minister for State Development Steven Miles said.
“Imagine new economy minerals which can be used to make batteries to store renewable energy, being moved from the North West Minerals Province to Townsville, on a train powered by hydrogen made from Queensland sunshine,” he added.
Having set a target to reach net zero operational emissions by 2050, Aurizon is also doing research and development for battery-powered trains with a number of industry parties and Australian universities.
“Hydrogen offers enormous opportunity in decarbonising and continuing to improve the competitiveness of Australia’s export supply chains,” Aurizon’s Managing Director & CEO Andrew Harding said.
“This is especially true for bulk products underpinning the Australian economy including minerals, agricultural products and fertilisers, industrials and general freight.”
Precisely what role the state government will play in the feasibility study isn’t clear, it may simply be one of financial or regulatory support, though this isn’t specified in its statement.
The Queensland government has also bought a Hyundai Nexo FCEV for its Brisbane police team.
The singular vehicle will be something of a test vehicle, allowing the North Brisbane Domestic and Family Violence Vulnerable Persons Unit, where the car has been assigned, to assess how well FCEVs work in the context of real world policing. Minister de Brenni said this will in turn pave the way for fuel cell technologies to be used in broader applications.
“Importantly, [Hyundai Nexos] offer ultra-quick refuelling and high efficiency – they will be able to be refuelled commercially in just five minutes,” the minister said. “Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles also have a better range than regular battery-powered options that are available now on the market.
“Nexo broke records in May this year by traveling 887 kilometres on a single charge and Hyundai tells us this is the first fuel cell propelled police vehicle in the southern hemisphere.
“Queensland police will test this emerging electric vehicle technology, initially refuelling at the Redlands Research Facility, and following that at Queensland’s first commercial hydrogen refueller,” the minister added.
The Nexo joins 13 Mitsubishi EVs now being used by police for general duties, traffic enforcement and investigations.
The state government said its Nexo is one of five hydrogen FCEVs now being trialed across its fleet, though it did not specify where the other four were used aside from mentioning frontline workers including health staff, educators and community workers.
The Nexo trial is being managed by QFleet.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/14/construction-begins-on-the-100-mw-capital-battery-in-canberra/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY",BELLA PEACOCK,"DECEMBER 14, 2021",Construction begins on the 100 MW Capital battery in Canberra,"French renewable and storage developer, Neoen, is all set to start construction on its 100 MW / 200 MWh Capital Battery after it announced it has been “provided notice to proceed from battery storage experts Doosan.” 
Neoen is presumably referring here to Doosan GridTech, the energy storage subsidiary of South Korea’s Doosan Heavy Industries and Construction, a partner on the project.
Having previously worked with Tesla on its Australian big battery projects, Neoen now seems to be expanding its horizons. It is not clear what brand of battery Doosan will use for the Capital Battery, though the company seems to favour Samsung’s lithium-ion, though it has previously developed projects using battery technology from CATL, LG Chem, and even vanadium redox flow batteries.
The battery is expected to start operating in the first half of 2023, and is being build next to TransGrid’s Queanbeyan substation, through which it will link to Transgrid’s transmission network.
Not to be confused with the planned 250 MW Big Canberra Battery, for which the government is yet to announce a developer, the Neoen’s Capital Battery came about after the developer won the ACT Government’s 2020 renewable energy auction, in which it was awarded a 14-year contract to supply 100 MW of wind energy from Stage 1 of Goyder Renewables Zone, including plans for a 50 MW battery. The storage component of the plan later doubled to the 100 MW capacity it has today “in response to the emerging market for battery services,” Neoen said.

“The doubling of battery capacity to 100 MW is a great commitment and indicates the confidence in the market and the important role of batteries in modernising and stabilising the electricity network,” ACT Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Shane Rattenbury, said in a statement on the news.
Also noteworthy is the fact the Capital Battery will have a two hour duration, Neoen’s longest for an Australian storage project to date (though it will likely only hold this position for a limited time).
It’s been a massive week for Neoen, which owns or is developing the biggest pipeline of utility-scale batteries in Australia by a long shot. The company officially switched on its 300 MW / 450 MWh Victorian big battery in Geelong last Wednesday, and on the very same day announced plans for 300MW and 800MWh battery in Blyth, north of Adelaide.

The Capital Battery takes Neoen’s Australian battery storage portfolio to 576 MW in operation or under construction, bringing the company a step closer to its goal of having at least one large-scale battery operating in each state of Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM). The company has crossed the halfway threshold to that goal now, with batteries in three of the five NEM states. 
Neoen’s global pool of storage assets sits today at over 700 MW, the vast majority of which are in Australia.
While the Capital Battery will continue to be owned and operated by Neoen, which has successfully used this model for its South Australian Hornsdale Power Reserve and now with its Victorian Big Battery, the company said once Capital Battery is operational, it plans to launch a “Community Co-investment Scheme” to provide residents of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) the opportunity to become financial stakeholders in the project. 
Precisely what such a scheme will look like is not yet clear though.
What is clear is that the ACT government, one of the country’s most progressive in terms of clean energy, is eager to install battery storage.
In January, it announced $100 million would be spent in the next five financial years to deliver what is to be known as the Big Canberra Battery. In April, it put its pitch to suppliers and received 42 submissions, most of which came from Australian companies.

The government is yet to announce its pick, but has previously said it hopes to begin construction on the 250 MW (duration yet to be finalised) Big Canberra Battery in 2022 – 2023.
In May, the territory also energised a 2.5 MW/5 MWh front-of meter Tesla Megapack battery developed by Australia’s Elvin Group. It’s the first battery installation in Australia to supplement an urban power supply at scale, and was developed in line with the needs of ACT network distributor Evoenergy.
In 2020, the ACT reached its goal of being 100% powered by renewable electricity. It aims to reach net zero emissions by 2045.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/14/storing-solar-power-with-compressed-carbon-dioxide/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,ITALY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 14, 2021",Storing solar power with compressed carbon dioxide,"From pv magazine Global
Italy-based Energy Dome has developed a modular, scalable system for utility-scale, long-term electricity storage based on compressed CO2. It claims that the system is a non-site-dependent solution for storing wind and solar power, as well as grid electricity.
“The concept is the same as compressed air energy storage (CAES) and liquid air technologies” Energy Dome CEO Claudio Spadacini told pv magazine. “With the difference, however, that storing CO2 can be done by occupying less space than with compressed air and without the need for finding a cavern or implementing underground works.”
The reduced volume at ambient temperature, which is required by the technology on the high-pressure side of the system, is the “secret sauce” for the CO2 battery’s competitive costs and high performance, according to its creators. These main features depend on the fact that CO2 becomes liquid with ambient temperature and pressure of only 70 bars.
“Unlike CAES and liquid air technologies, our storage concept is non-site dependent and can be applied almost anywhere without having to deal with extreme cryogenic temperatures,” said Spadacini.
The system draws CO2 from an inflatable atmospheric gas holder, which the company named Dome, and stores it under a 70 bar pressure at ambient temperature in a high-density liquid state. When the stored energy is needed, the CO2 is evaporated and conveyed through a turbine that produces power. After this process is implemented, the CO2 goes back to the atmospheric gas holder to be used again for another storage cycle, without any emissions to the atmosphere.
“It is a closed-loop cycle and no CO2 is released in the atmosphere,” Spadacini said. “The system, on the other hand, doesn’t need too much CO2 to work, I would say a few hundred tons would be enough for about 100 MWh of electricity.”
One of the Energy Dome’s main advantages, he said, is that this technology uses off-the-shelf components. There is no need for a new factory to be put up and running in order to have a plant built, nor extensive testing time of new turbomachinery or new chemical reactions.
The system’s optimal charge/discharge cycle should range from four to 24 hours which, according to the company, makes it perfectly suitable for daily and intra-day cycling when used for energy storage by grid operators and utilities. Its round-trip efficiency can reach up to 80%. The system modular design enables the construction of facilities with a storage capacity of up to 200 MWh.
“We expect a levelised cost of storage (LCOS) of our technology already below $100/MWh with the first commercial plant we are going to build. With wider deployment of our technology, we are aiming to drop the LCOS below $60/MWh in a few years’ time,” Spadacini said.
Energy Dome has recently raised $11 million through a Series A funding round and intends to use the proceeds for its first 2 MW/4 MWh pilot project in Sardinia, which it is developing in partnership with Italian utility A2A.
“This project will be tested for grid electricity storage in the first quarter of next year,” Spadacini explained. “But our technology is also intended for the storage of power generated by large-scale wind and solar plants.”
The company is targeting markets such as North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, India and Australia.
“Our technology allows for worldwide deployment of competitive energy storage plants without any geographical limitations,” concluded Spadacini.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/14/solar-to-bloom-in-the-desert-thanks-to-innovative-nt-green-hydrogen-project/,"HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,ASIA,AUSTRALIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY",BLAKE MATICH,"DECEMBER 14, 2021",Solar to bloom in the desert thanks to innovative NT green hydrogen project,"The Northern Territory (NT) government has granted Major Project Status to water-from-air technology company Aqua Aerem to develop its $15 billion 10 GW Desert Bloom Hydrogen project (Desert Bloom) in Tennant Creek, NT, with ambitious plans for commercial production by 2023.
Around the world, large-scale green hydrogen projects are being touted for highly irradiated regions looking to utilise solar resources for the much touted future green hydrogen economy. However, it is often the case that highly sunny places are also places of high water scarcity. And this is exactly the hurdle Desert Bloom has a unique ability to avoid.
According to Aqua Aerem (literally ‘water-air’ in Latin), for every one kilogram of hydrogen produced, nine litres of water is required. Aqua Aerem’s patented proprietary technology captures water from the atmosphere in arid environments using off-grid solar energy, with no waste other than air. This commercial quantity of water can then be used in solar electrolysis whereby water is split into its constituent parts, namely hydrogen and oxygen.
Aqua Aerem’s co-founder and CEO Gerard Reiter said the project was “transformative” in the way it had managed to overcome water supply and solar/electrolysis integration problems that have so far held back global renewable hydrogen production.
“With today’s announcement, the pathway for green hydrogen becomes a reality,” said Reiter. “Our air-to-water technology, which solves this previously intractable water supply problem, is a world first; invented and developed here in Australia. This technology will open the door for green hydrogen projects to be located where the best renewable power sources are available, which is generally in the driest areas of the planet.”
From March, the company ran a 12-week pilot project at just such a dry area, Tennant Creek, close to existing gas pipeline infrastructure, and is now moving to a commercial construction phase in 2022 with plans to produce approximately 410,000 tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2027 at a price point below $US2/kilogram.
Like other large-scale green hydrogen projects, Desert Bloom is being planned as a series of interconnected modular and portable systems, in this case, 2 MW Hydrogen Production Units (HPUs) that will each generate water, heat, electricity, and of course hydrogen. If everything goes according to plan Desert Bloom will comprise around 4,000 HPUs.
According to a statement, Aqua Aerem’s majority owner, Sanguine Impact Investment, will be providing the capital for the project, and already has agreements with a large unnamed Japanese gas buyer and NT power utility Territory Generation.
“The project has multiple competitive advantages,” Reiter continued. “It uses proven technology and has its own water supply. It benefits from the world’s best solar resources, does not require large sunk costs before it begins producing, and it is located at the ‘energy corridor’ of rail, road and gas pipeline infrastructure linking directly to Darwin Port. It also offers the most direct, cost-effective route to Asian export markets.”
For these reasons, Reiter believes the project will reach the US$2/kilogram hydrogen goal, the closest project outlook yet to Australia’s National Hydrogen Strategy target of $2/kilogram.
NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner said the development of projects such as Desert Bloom Hydrogen would see the Territory play a lead role in the emerging renewable hydrogen market.

“Being the ‘comeback capital’ means diversifying the projects we have in the Territory – and Desert Bloom now marks the Territory’s 14th Major Project that’s in the works,” said Gunner, “Territorians will see the benefits on the ground in Central Australia and in the Top End with around 1000 jobs and $1 billion a year in export revenue from this project alone – it’s good news for the Territory.”
NT Minister for Renewables and Energy, Eva Lawler, said “Desert Bloom Hydrogen technology provides an innovative approach to secure a sustainable water supply, which is an essential in the development of renewable hydrogen and will be particularly valuable in arid areas.”
And Major Project Commissioner Jason Schoolmeester noted the potential of Desert Bloom to supply renewable power to regional industries “including mining and agribusinesses,” and “will provide a competitive advantage in a world that is increasingly focused n sustainable supply chains.”

The Darwin-Katherine Battery Energy Storage System (DK BESS) is expected to generate cost savings of approximately $9.8 million annually and pay for itself within five years (or thereabouts). 
Hitachi Energy Country Managing Director, Bernard Norton, said “Hitachi Energy’s battery energy storage solution will be part of an intelligent electrical ecosystem and ensure full utilisation of solar energy generation and less reliance on fossil fuels.”
Before adding: “This battery energy storage system will allow greater penetration of renewable energy in the Territory, helping to ensure a sustainable, flexible and secure energy system for today’s generations and those to come.”.”
The DK BESS is set to be built at NT energy utility Territory Generation’s Channel Island Power Station and service the Darwin-Katherine grid that services 150,000 Territorians (one in six of whom have solar panels on their rooftops). The DK BESS is expected to unlock more capacity for residential and C&I PV. 
Territory Generation CEO, Gerhard Laubscher, said “The Darwin-Katherine battery is a cornerstone of Territory Generation’s Fleet Transition. It is key to unlocking flexibility in our fleet to better manage the increasing impacts of solar on the system.”
What is more, the DK BESS will reduce the Darwin-Katherine grid’s dependency on gas-fired spinning reserves and provide 58,000 tonnes of avoided emissions. 
“We’ve backed renewables and so have Territorians,” said NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner, “they know renewables deliver cleaner, cheaper and secure power. The cutting-edge technology in our Battery Energy Storage System will reinforce the Northern Territory as the solar capital and comeback capital of Australia.”
NT Minister for Renewables and Energy, Eva Lawler, added that “The awarding of the BESS tender is a huge step forward in our plan for 50% renewables by 2030 – it is the cornerstone of our Darwin-Katherine System Plan. Our electricity will be reliable and stable, while also being affordable for Territorians.”
