Microgrid has in the first instance targeted established shopping centres for its embedded networks and general manager Alan Waller told pv magazine the company has agreements which are well advanced with several property owners.
“We’ve got a portfolio of sites which are going through the last stages of the explicit informed consent process,” he said.
“They are signed, sealed and delivered and we’ve reached all the regulatory consent processes and whatever else we’ve needed to reach so the next step is to install and kick them off.
“We’ll be stepping into that operational mode within the next couple of weeks.”
Microgrid will rent the roof space from the property owner. There they will install solar PV modules with the electricity generated to be distributed via an embedded network to the individual tenants and common areas.
Waller said Microgrid would install, own and maintain the equipment and there would be no up-front costs for the property owner or tenants.
“There are a few winners in that,” he said. “The shopping centre owner receives the rental for his roof space and we’re able to pump that solar generated through the matrix board and the network to all the tenancies so all the tenants benefit from solar-subsidised electricity.
“An associated benefit for both the owners are the green credentials which come from buying into renewable energies.”
Waller said Microgrid would initially focus on smaller shopping centres as it looks to establish itself as an embedded network operator (ENO).
“This coming year should see us with upwards of 10-15 embedded network sites and the pipeline lead for that is very strong indeed,” he said.
“We’re looking at existing shopping centres around the country in particular, and commercial office locations, where we are able to create an embedded network but also able to install certain size solar systems on the roof.
“We will go into a shopping centre and put anywhere from 100 to 300 kW on the top.
“Initially we’re talking about smaller suburban shopping centres. Anywhere between 20 and 50 tenancies and the solar profiles are perfect for us. There is not too much excess and what we can’t generate from the solar we top up by buying from the grid through a gate meter.”
Waller has been a part of the embedded network industry since 2004. In recent years was part of Energy Australia’s push into the sector before moving to Frasers Property where he helped establish its embedded network operation.
When The Green Guys Group launched Microgrid Power in late 2019, Waller was part of the plan. Since then he has been kept busy “putting it all together and going through the authorisation process”.
That process is now complete with the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) recently signing off on Microgrid’s electricity retailer authorisation application.
While that authorisation is not essential for operation, with ENOs able to act with the required exemptions, Waller said it was a case of staying ahead of the curve with regulators looking to “tighten up” the industry.
“The AEMC (Australian Energy Market Commission) is going through a process to further regulate the industry,” he said.
“What they are intending to do, and are working towards, is a rule change whereby they will want all embedded network operators such us ourselves and all the other guys to hold a retail licence rather than be exempt operators.
“They feel that is going to make them a lot more accountable and they’ll be able to standardise the industry.”
Waller however suggested the process could have detrimental impacts on some operators.
“It’s not a cheap or easy process to go through so a lot of the smaller operators will think twice about whether they want to do it or if they want to continue on at all,” he said. “But, I think this tidy up is well overdue.”

The greenhouse will utilise ClearVue’s transparent solar glass technology which is designed to preserve glass transparency while generating electricity. Data supplied by the company indicates the technology delivers a minimum of 30 watts per sqm while maintaining 70% transparency.
The IGUs feature solar PV cells around the edges of each unit. The units incorporate a nanoparticle interlayer and spectral-selective coating on the rear external surface which allow much of the light to pass through but redirects infrared and UV light to the edge of the IGU where it is harvested by solar cells
ClearVue CEO Ken Jagger said the company expects the greenhouse, when operational, will generate greater market awareness of its building-integrated PV (BIPV) technology.
“We are starting to see strong interest globally for the ClearVue product from greenhouse suppliers, growers and other protected cropping end-users,” he said.
“We expect the fully constructed greenhouse to lead to an even greater market awareness of our technology and product.”
Main construction of the supporting greenhouse structure was completed in December and the installation of glazing is expected to be finished within the coming weeks ahead of commissioning with plant trials due to start in March or April.
The greenhouse is being built adjacent to two recently completed polycarbonate research greenhouses that form part of a larger research precinct.
The project is the first commercial-scale demonstration of ClearVue’s PV IGU technology in a protected-cropping agriculture setting and the company is confident it will perform well.
ClearVue’s data sheet indicates traditional greenhouses experience a temperature range of +/-6° from optimum temperature while its technology delivers a temperature range of +/-2° from the optimum temperature, providing an increased growth rate of up to 20-30%.
“We look forward to updating the market once the greenhouse is commissioned in the next few months, and as the larger research aspects of the project progresses,” Jagger said.
When work began on the greenhouse in December, Jagger said the project marked a “major milestone for the company”.
Jagger said the trial results would not only help facilitate the commercial application of the technology across protected-cropping agriculture markets, but also across high-rise commercial buildings.
While BIPV is yet to enjoy the same widespread deployment as building-applied PV (BAPV),it has been identified by the Australian PV Institute (APVI) as one of five key avenues for increased market penetration of PV.
The APVI said the multi-functionality of BIPV meant it had huge potential.

The collaboration will include the development of a network of hydrogen refuelling stations across the nation and the provision of Hyzon’s hydrogen-powered commercial vehicles.
Pure Hydrogen managing director Scott Brown said the MoU was a significant step for the Sydney-based company.
“This MoU with such an established and respected hydrogen fuel cell vehicle company like Hyzon is an outstanding development and excellent validation of our plans to develop a hydrogen-focused energy business in Australia,” he said.
Brown added the collaboration is one of a number of hydrogen-based initiatives Pure Hydrogen is pursuing as it looks to grow its business.
Pure Hydrogen and Hyzon have also agreed under the MoU to work on a ‘wet hire’ option where Australian customers will be able to hire Hyzon’s commercial vehicles on a monthly basis in a package deal that includes the vehicle’s cost, services and hydrogen fuel.
Hyzon Motors Australia director John Feenan said the Australian market has emerged as a major focus for the company.
“We see Australia as a key market for the integration of hydrogen power technology into hard-to-abate sectors such as heavy transportation,” he said.
“This MoU with Pure Hydrogen paves the way for both parties to boost the hydrogen infrastructure capabilities of Australia and propel the nation’s fleet operators towards a zero-emission future. We look forward to working with Pure Hydrogen on this shared initiative.”
Hyzon, which supplies hydrogen fuel cell-powered commercial vehicles, including trucks, buses and coaches, has a well-established Australian presence.
In August 2020, Hyzon was contracted to supply mining giant Fortescue Metals Group with a fleet of hydrogen-fuelled buses to transport workers at the company’s Christmas Creek iron ore mine in the Pilbara.
In October, Hyzon signed a MoU with Perth-based industrial technology company WarpForge for the development of a ‘SuperBus’.
WarpForge will look to deliver a new bus shell that incorporate Hyzon’s hydrogen fuel cell technology, providing for longer driving ranges, reduced manufacturing costs and emission-free driving.
Development of the prototype ‘SuperBus’ is expected to start this year.

The increase is attributed to the now more than 28,000 solar generators in the nation’s capital. 
“Canberrans are playing a significant part in generating the ACT’s 100% renewable electricity supply,” said Minister for Water, Energy and Emissions Reduction, Shane Rattenbury. “Canberrans recognise the value solar has to our clean, green and affordable energy future.” 
According to the same report, the ACT Government’s small and medium FiT scheme (which closed to new applicants in 2011) supported 10,153 rooftop solar generators last year, generating 47,296 MWh of electricity. This represents a 1.6% increase in uptake through the program from the previous year while the cost of the scheme itself actually fell 1.46% to just 83 cents for the average punter. 

“The FiT scheme, which was designed as an incentive to boost solar uptake when the technology was new and more expensive, has made an important contribution to renewable electricity generation in the ACT,” continued Rattenbury. 
The total installed capacity from solar generators by the end of the last financial year in Canberra was 135 MW. Meaning that not subsidised uptake of solar is soaring too. The continued uptake of solar by Canberrans is seen by the ACT Government as playing a key role in maintaining its 100% renewable electricity supply.  

This year the ACT Government is also rolling out its Sustainable Household Loan Scheme, an effort to help Canberrans easily negotiate the up-front barrier to rooftop solar. The scheme offers interest-free loans of up to $15,000 for households and not-for-profit community organisations to help with the upfront cost of investing in rooftop solar panels, household battery storage, as well as zero emission vehicles and other energy efficient appliances. 
“Installing solar at your home or business can bring your energy costs down while contributing to our 100% renewable electricity supply,” said Rattenbury, “so I encourage Canberrans to look how they can contribute to Canberra’s clean energy future.” 
According to the Clean Energy Regulator’s (CER) November 2020 Carbon Markets Report, rooftop solar continued to surge in 2020 despite the Covid-19 pandemic. Demand for rooftop solar is expected to remain strong in the future too, according to the CER. It commissioned modelling that suggests an average of 3.2 GW could be added each year for the next four years. “If realised, this investment would effectively double rooftop solar capacity, to 26 GW, by the end of 2024.” This, Parker says, would “dramatically change” the energy landscape in Australia, with small and mid-scale sectors set to outstrip the capacity of the large-scale sector.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/15/how-australia-can-phase-out-coal-power-while-maintaining-energy-security/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JANUARY 15, 2021",How Australia can phase out coal power while maintaining energy security,"From The Conversation.
That’s why we need to talk about the role governments can play to ensure the transition is orderly, maintains energy security, avoids price spikes that have followed past closures, looks after affected workers and communities, and ensures Australia meets its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 to 26-28% below 2005 levels.

At least halving emissions from coal-fired power stations (which account for about 90% of electricity sector emissions) by 2030 is an obvious route to achieve Australia’s international commitments.
Given most state governments are already committed to forcing renewables into the grid at record pace, that could happen even without federal action.
But continuing down the current path will be unnecessarily costly, and pose significant risks to supply and prices as coal-fired generators exit on sporadic timelines based on their viability. These risks are part of the reason why Australia’s Energy Security Board is considering mechanisms that facilitate an orderly transition from coal-fired generation to renewables as one of four priority reform areas.
National leadership and careful policy design are needed to enable coal plant operators to bow out of the market gracefully, and in a manner that secures certainty for investors, consumers, workers and communities.
Learning from past closures
Past closures of South Australia’s Northern and Playford B power stations in Port Augusta (in 2016) and Victoria’s Hazelwood power station in the Latrobe Valley (in 2017) illustrate this point.
Price spikes followed the closure of these plants. In the case of Hazelwood, majority owner Engie gave barely five months’ notice of its closure in March 2017. With Hazelwood, a brown-coal-fired generator accounting for 20% of Victoria’s electricity supply and 5% of national output, the supply ramifications were significant. Victoria’s average electricity prices increased from A$60 to A$100 per megawatt hour (MWh).

These offer a stark warning to policy makers. The market requires adequate notice of coal-fired generator exits. Greater certainty provides investors with the assurance they need to build enough capacity to replace retiring coal plants, and the infrastructure to connect them to the grid. A haphazard transformation is in no one’s interests.
A new Coal-Generation Phasedown Mechanism
We outline a market-based mechanism to achieve just that in a report published by the Blueprint Institute, an Australian think tank established last year to promote rational, pragmatic policy proposals.
The Coalition has generally claimed to oppose market-based mechanisms — such as emissions trading schemes or carbon taxes — to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But the Abbott government in 2014 introduced an emissions trading scheme alongside its A$2.5 billion Emissions Reduction Fund, a mechanism the Morrison government rebadged in 2019 as the Climate Solutions Fund. A “Safeguard Mechanism” sets emissions caps for the country’s highest-emitting businesses, with emissions permits tradeable on the open market.
To facilitate the orderly phasedown of coal-fired electricity generation, we propose a “Coal-Generation Phasedown Mechanism” (CPM), leveraging the Safeguard Mechanism to establish sector emissions targets — for 2026, 2028 and beyond 2030.
A key component of the CPM is the use of auctions to achieve withdrawals of coal generation from the electricity market. Auctions are commonplace in commercial and government contexts. The federal government has long used auctions to allocate telecommunications spectrum, for example, and the Emissions Reduction Fund uses reverse auctions to buy the most cost-effective emissions abatement.
The CPM would set emissions targets to phase down coal-fired generation to halve current emissions by 2030. Under a well-designed auction system, the least profitable coal generators would withdraw from the market first, ensuring emissions reductions occur at minimum cost.
One possible scenario is shown in the graph below. Example generators have been chosen based on their operating costs and approximate remaining life. Those with higher costs and a shorter remaining life have greater incentives to bid for earlier exits.

The CPM should also be designed to ensure financial support for affected workers. This could be in the form of redeployment, retraining opportunities or generous remuneration in the case of retrenchment.
A phasedown of coal-fired generation will come at a cost to someone — either taxpayers or investors in coal-fired generation. This cost can be made larger or smaller. It can be hidden from view. But it cannot be avoided. The proper role for government is to minimise and fairly distribute those costs.
We can’t predict exactly how much the phasedown will cost, because that depends on information known only to the generators. But a market-based mechanism is sure to minimise those costs.
The CPM can be designed to ensure the least viable plants close first. How much money generators receive to close or pay to stay open is an entirely separate question. The CPM can be designed to accommodate any financial commitment by taxpayers.
At one extreme, the federal government could pay generators to close by fully compensating auction participants for the loss of future profits, as has been adopted in Germany. But this would likely require a federal funding commitment significantly larger than under the existing Emissions Reduction Fund, which might make it politically unpalatable.
At the other extreme, the government could charge operators for the right to stay open. One significant advantage of this option is it would raise revenue that could then be used to support directly affected communities. This could be modelled on Western Australia’s “Royalties for Regions” program, which allocates a quarter of the state’s mining and petroleum royalties to programs benefiting regional and rural areas.
A funding allocation between these two extremes is also possible, decided through government negotiation with the industry.
Ultimately, the question of who pays is a political decision. But political difficulties shouldn’t be used as an excuse for delay. The economic rationale for the CPM stacks up either way.
We must avoid another Hazelwood or Port Augusta, and coordinate an orderly grid transformation that provides certainty to communities, workers, investors, and consumers alike.

As variable renewable energy sources, primarily solar and wind, come to represent a larger portion of the world’s energy mix, balancing their inherent intermittency with the need for a constant and reliable energy supply becomes more of a challenge.
And with many regions setting high targets for renewable energy deployment by 2030, the coming decade will start to bring these challenges into focus. Energy storage technologies will of course be key here, but another strategy that’s gaining ground involves designing hybrid systems based on two more generation sources, and taking advantage of their different variability profiles to boost the level of power available to the grid at a given time.
A group of scientists led by Sweden’s Mälardalen University dived into recent research into this topic, bringing together a series of conclusions that highlight recent developments and suggest research priorities to keep hybrid renewables systems moving forward, noting the  clear potential of the hybrid approach with studies that have shown wind and solar hybrid systems can reduce the need for storage by 50% compared to either technology operating alone. These conclusions are published in the paper A review on the complementarity of renewable energy sources: Concept, metrics, application and future research directions, in the journal Solar Energy.
The authors also reference multiple studies that demonstrated how multiple generation sources can smooth energy fluctuations on wider grids, and suggest that hybrid approaches can also have a positive effect beyond electricity grids in the wider water-energy-food nexus, particularly in cases involving hydropower. “A good case is a power system dominated by hydropower, where the reservoirs are often used for energy generation as well as irrigation purposes (food-energy nexus),” the researchers state. “In such cases, the hydropower generation can be reduced during dry periods by utilising photovoltaics or wind power.”
The group notes that a range of economic obstacles also stands in the way of further hybrid systems development, and notes Germany’s market premium scheme as a good example of supportive policy. On the research side, a better understanding of the complementarity between different sources is needed, based on field data and modelling that takes into account expected changes to regional climates, more sources of generation, particularly for regions such as Africa and Asia, where little research has so far been carried out. And also key to further development will the creation of a consistent methodology, allowing better comparison between studies and systems.
