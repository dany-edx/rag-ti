LG Electronics has unveiled 14 new residential and commercial models as part of its NeON range with the first of the new solar PV modules expected to be available in Australia later this month or next.
The new models include different power variants of the NeON H, NeON H Black, NeON H Bi-Facial, NeON R and NeON R Prime modules.
LG Electronics Australia general manager Gus Pavian said the new product range is caters for both residential and commercial applications and delivers improved performance when compared to previous models.
“Our latest range of NeON solar modules is the most reliable and efficient renewable energy solution that LG has designed,” he said.
Included in the new releases is the NeON H module. Based on 120 n-type half-cut bifacial solar cells, the residential model features a power output of 390 W, and an efficiency of 21.2%.
The new module is claimed to have a temperature coefficient of -0.33% per degree Celsius, which the manufacturer said was verified based on internal accelerated test data. The NeON H is also available in a 455 W variant for commercial applications.
The modules come with a 25-year power output guarantee and the NeON H module is said to be able to operate at 90.6% and the NeON R to 92.5% of its original performance after 25 years.
Pavian said the new modules provide outstanding performance in harsh weather conditions, making them ideal for Australia.
“The NeON H is built to perform, built to last,” he said.
“The unique mix of low-light conditions, high temperatures and salt environments in Australia makes the LG NeON H particularly well suited for the local climate.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/11/telstra-dials-up-its-renewable-energy-commitment/,"MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 11, 2021",Telstra dials up its renewable energy commitment,"Australia’s largest telecommunications provider, Telstra has secured a long-term power purchase agreement to source energy from the $100 million, 58 MW extension of the Crookwell wind farm being developed by Global Power Generation (GPG).
While the term and size of the PPA was not revealed, the telco giant confirmed it will pay a fixed price for the majority of all the energy produced by the wind farm over the term of the agreement with GPG to sell the remaining energy into the market themselves.
Telstra CEO Andrew Penn said the deal, which follows the signing of off-take agreements with the 226 MW Murra Warra Wind Farm near Horsham in Victoria and the 70 MW Emerald Solar Park in Queensland, marked a continuation of the company’s transition to 100% renewable electricity by 2025.
“When this wind farm starts production in mid-2023, we will be more than halfway to our goal,” he said in a statement.
“Crookwell 3 joins our stable of renewable energy investments, and when combined with Murra Warra Wind Farm and Emerald Solar Farm, will supply more than 150,000 homes’ worth of non-renewable electricity consumption each year.
“By 2025, our plan means we will own or contract renewable energy generation equivalent to 100% of the energy we consume in all of our operations. That includes running our network, buildings and data centres.”

Penn said the deal reinforced Telsta’s commitment to addressing climate change, saying that as one of the biggest energy users in the nation the company had a responsibility to lead the way.
“We cannot live in hope that this climate challenge will solve itself,” he said.
“Big businesses like Telstra have a responsibility to be good climate citizens, to have a strategy and to set an example for others.
“As one of the biggest energy users in the nation, it matters when we take action to both decarbonise our operations and clean up the grid for the future.
“The Crookwell project is an important part of Telstra’s renewable journey and will help drive us toward reducing our absolute emissions by at least 50% by 2030.
The PPA announcement comes on the same day that Greenpeace Australia Pacific revealed Telstra was leading the way for Australian telcos, data centres and tech companies in the race to renewables.
The new Greenpeace report found that Telstra, Australia’s 14th biggest electricity user overall, is leading the way, closely followed by TPG Telecom, which owns major brands such as Vodafone and iiNet, and has also vowed to be 100% renewable by 2025.
While Optus, the nation’s second largest telco, is missing from the least due to it having set no renewable electricity target to date, Greenpeace REenergise campaign director Lindsay Soutar said telecommunications is fast emerging as one of the leading industries in Australia’s renewable energy transition.
“As this new ranking reveals, some Australian telcos and tech companies, such as Telstra and TPG Telecom, are on a super-fast stream to clean energy. But some of the local tech industry is still buffering, with big players such as Optus and NextDC yet to say yes to a 100% renewable electricity target,” she said.
Greenpeace said Telcos and IT services consume approximately 4% of Australia’s electricity – equivalent to about 580,000 homes.

The Crookwell 3 Wind Farm is being developed by GPG, a 75-25 joint venture between Spain’s Naturgy Energy Group and the Kuwait Investment Authority.
The project, being constructed alongside the existing 91 MW Crookvale 2 Wind Farm in the NSW Southern Tablelands, will take GPG’s renewable capacity in the Australia to more than 700 MW.
Included in GPG’s Australian portfolio is a quartet of wind farms in Victoria including  Berrybank Stage 1 (180 MW) which the company said is close to operational, Berrybank Stage-2 (107 MW), Ryan Corner (218 MW) and Hawkesdale (97 MW), which are all under development.
The company said in a statement it also has a project pipeline of more than 600 MW in the Australia and aims to become one of the main independent renewable operators in the country in the next three years, reaching a total capacity of more than 1.3 GW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/11/japanese-duo-team-up-to-build-queensland-solar-farm/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 11, 2021",Japanese duo team up to build Queensland solar farm,"Japanese companies Sojitz and Eneos have partnered in a 50-50 joint venture to develop the 204 MW Edenvale Solar Park, confirming work has already commenced at the 428-hectare site near Chinchilla, on the Western Downs.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk welcomed the announcement, saying on Thursday the investment reinforced the state’s standing as a renewable energy powerhouse.
“This is a show of international confidence in the strength of our economic recovery plan and in Queensland’s renewable energy future,” she said.
“This project will create a local jobs bonanza with over 400 jobs required during the construction phase.”
The Australian subsidiary of Gransolar Group has the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract with the plant expected to be energised in Q1 2023.
Initially developed by Singapore-based DPI Solar 3, the solar facility will connect to the transmission grid via Powerlink’s existing Orana substation within the Southern Queensland Renewable Energy Zone.
The project will sell 70% of its output to a local electricity retailer while the remaining 30% will be supplied to the nearby Gregory Crinum coal mine, which Sojitz owns and operates.
Edenvale Solar Park is the first solar PV project in Australia for both Eneos, which has a significant focus on renewables and hydrogen, and Sojitz which has a long involvement with Queensland’s mining industry.
Sojitz, whose interests in Australia range from mining and agriculture to hospitals and forestry, described Australia as a “high growth market” for renewables, pointing to its vast land area and high level of solar radiation.
“Sojitz aims to not only develop the projects in Australia moving forward, but also to provide a stable supply of renewable energy to Australian companies and Japanese companies conducting business in Australia,” the company said in a statement
Eneos also has grand ambitions in Australia, looking to develop a CO2-free hydrogen supply chain here with plans to expand its renewable power generation capacity to 1,000 MW in and outside of Japan by 2022-23.
President Katsuyuki Ota said in an interview with Reuters last year Eneos is eyeing renewable energy projects in Australia as part of its transformation into a supplier of low-carbon energy and materials as the demand for oil continues to decline.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/11/solarwatt-bmw-launch-new-storage-system-for-residential-pv/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",CORNELIA LICHNER,"JUNE 11, 2021","Solarwatt, BMW launch new storage system for residential PV","From pv magazine Germany
After two years of development, German solar module and battery manufacturer Solarwatt has unveiled its residential storage system – the Battery flex AC-1. With this move, the company phased out its My Reserve series after many years and began, again, cooperation with German car manufacturer BMW, which has been the main shareholder in Solarwatt for several years.
The new battery will be available from autumn, initially as a single-phase, AC-coupled device. Two more variants are to follow next year, one for coupling to a hybrid inverter, and a complete solution with an integrated hybrid inverter. The DC solution previously developed by Solarwatt is initially not part of the planned Battery flex portfolio. However, Solarwatt leaves open the option of integrating this topology into the product family at a later date.
All three storage products included in the new series should look the same. They consist of a basic electronic module on which several battery modules – each with a usable capacity of 2.4 kWh – can be stacked, and which ends with a top battery module. The power unit can later be ordered as a suitable hybrid or battery inverter, or for coupling to a hybrid inverter.
During a demonstration by Olaf Wollersheim, managing director of Solarwatt, stacking and connecting the 25kg battery modules only took a few seconds because the connections on the top and bottom were very easy to perform. Before doing this, however, it is necessary to assemble the wall bracket and to put the electronics module into operation. Each battery module comes with a piece of the wall bracket in the package, which is then also connected as a plug-in system to a fixed column. The column has a rail profile in which the battery modules are hung and can be lowered. The electronics module is located on the floor and its cover can be removed. The connection cables for the connection to the power grid, the internet and the current sensor, are plugged in there.
In addition to the controller area network (CAN bus) connection, there is also an RS485 interface for hybrid inverters. The list of compatible hybrid inverters will probably only be available when the hybrid version is released. With the interface, several systems can also be parallelised as a cluster, explained Wollersheim. This could be used, for example, to operate several of the single-phase AC systems on different phases in parallel. The entire battery tower can be mounted either hanging it on the wall or standing on the floor.
The aluminium housing is matte black and hides handles and buttons behind flaps. In addition to the modularity and appearance, there is another aspect that might be of interest to customers. Together with BMW, Solarwatt will form a purchasing community for the components of the cell modules, which will then be assembled into battery modules in its own plant in Dresden, explained Wollersheim. He announced that BMW would ensure low purchase prices. At the same time, quality assurance should adapt to the automotive standard. BMW has made it its business to make the supply chain, from the minerals to the end product, traceable. According to its own statement, it does not use cobalt from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The smallest of the storage units has a capacity of 4.8 kWh and an output of 1.5 kW. It can be expanded to eight battery modules in steps of 2.4 kWh and has a maximum of 57.6 kWh and 6 kW of power. The system consumption in standby mode, AC & DC, when discharged, is specified as 25 W. Furthermore, heat pumps can be integrated.
The guarantee is for 10 years with a remaining capacity of 80% and Solarwatt will provide full replacement in the event of malfunction. The emergency power supply can later be retrofitted as a function, with an additional switch box.

Depositing the various layers that make up a PV cell stack onto a silicon wafer is among the most complex and expensive areas in PV cell & module manufacturing. The processes used here often require the creation of a vacuum, the use of flammable or otherwise hazardous precursor materials, high processing temperatures and other challenges.
A group of scientists led by the Technical University of Ilmenau in Germany had these factors in mind when it looked at the deposition of silicon dioxide (SiO2), which can be used as a passivation layer or a protective layer in various types of silicon PV cells. The group notes that plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) is the most common process used with this material, but requires both high temperatures and a vacuum.
The group looked into alternative processes including spray pyrolysis, low-pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD), sol-gel deposition, and atomic layer deposition, eventually settling on atmospheric pressure deposition (APCVD) as the best option for further investigation. “APCVD holds the advantage of using gases as reactant precursors in contrast to liquids,” the group explains. “Consequently, crack-free dense films with good step coverage can readily be obtained.”
Using APCVD, the group was able to demonstrate a low-temperature SiO2 deposition process that also eliminated the use of highly flammable hydrosilane as a precursor material. And since the equipment does not have to withstand very high temperatures, the entire setup could be made of low-cost thermoplastic material produced using 3D printing, making it easily adaptable to different wafer shapes and sizes.
The group investigated two different applications for the setup in solar cell manufacturing. First, single side texturing – wafers were coated on one side with around 180 nanometers of SiO2, and then annealed at 180 degrees Celsius. Secondly, the process used to deposit a protective layer to prevent parasitic plating of metals when laying down the cell fingers and busbars.
In the first application, the wafer was then treated with an alkaline texturing solution, which etched about 100 nm of the SiO2 layer and left a smooth, uniform surface. And in the second application, the SiO2 layer was shown to effectively protect against unwanted metal deposition. “The SiO2 coated areas of the cells were practically free of unwanted metal deposition,” the scientists stated. “Whereas there was massive parasitic plating in the uncoated areas.”
Cell efficiencies were measured between 19.3% and 19.8% – below what has already been achieved in PERC cell production. However, the group notes that its focus was on measuring the performance and reliability of the coating processes, meaning there was less overall focus on the cell efficiency. Full details of the work are found in the paper Application of hydrosilane-free atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition of SiOx films in the manufacture of crystalline silicon solar cells, published in Thin Solid Films.
“The newly developed APCVD setup provides a simple and tailorable approach for the deposition of SiO2 films on virtually every substrate material at room temperature,” the group concludes. “Because of the used non-flammable and inexpensive gases, the costs of the deposition equipment and of the operations are low. The presented simple APCVD SiO2 process can find several applications in photovoltaics.”
And work is ongoing to bring the process to an industrial scale, as part of a collaboration with Hannover-based coatings company Alethia, which is currently set to run until May 2022.
