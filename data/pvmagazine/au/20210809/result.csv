The big spinning machines could add unbudgeted millions to the cost of projects already a long way into development. But strategically placed synchronous condensers, installed by network providers to enable greater penetration of renewables into the National Electricity Market, are a whole other language.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) gave notice last week that two synchronous condensers, installed by South Australian transmission provider ElectraNet, had been commissioned and completed. A further two syncons at Robertstown will be commissioned this month.
Synchronous condensers were determined by ElectraNet to be the least-cost option for solving system strength (related to managing minor fluctuations in supply and demand on the network) and inertia (which maintains stable system frequency despite such minor fluctuations) problems in the presence of increasing renewable energy generation in South Australia.
That is, they replace the need to call on gas generators to manage gaps in asynchronous generation, delivering an estimated “net saving to customers equivalent to $3 to $5 a year on a typical South Australian residential electricity bill”, says ElectraNet, and at the same time reduce fossil-fuel emissions from gas in the national account.

The implication for solar and wind farms in South Australia, which are generally restricted in their combined output to a maximum of around 1,300 MW, to keep the current system in balance, is bottom-line changing.
AEMO has said that the four syncons will enable the limit on renewable, aka asynchronous, inverter-based, generation, to be raised to a maximum of 2,500 MW, which should enable the state’s existing solar and wind farms to generate at capacity.
These completed projects, along with renewable generation rippling down the pipeline — such as Iberdrola’s Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park with 107 MW of solar, partnered with 210 MW of wind; and Neoen’s recently DA-approved, massive Goyder South hybrid project (1.8 GW of wind and solar and up to 900 MW of battery storage) — will also find greater purchase when Project Energy Connect, the $2.3 billion, 800 MW capacity transmission link to NSW and Victoria is completed in 2025, and their generation will be able to access interstate demand.
The combination of system-strength boosting syncons, batteries to super-soak up peak variable renewable generation and judicious network upgrades is also being deployed in Victoria as a more flexible alternative to massive investment in transmission and distribution networks.
In May, Victorian distribution provider Powercor announced a plan to position 16 syncons, 20 batteries adjacent to substations in its network and selected network augmentation, to support the Victorian state government’s push to a 45-50% decrease in emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050.
The combined effect of its investment, Powercor said, would be to unlock more than 1.3 GW of queueing large-scale renewable generation and enable greater distributed rooftop penetration, as well as increasing the reliability of the regional network by an average of 22%.
The promise of the Robertstown and Davenport syncons, to enable more renewable generation to feed into the grid will be realised in stages, says AEMO.
Stage 1 of plant commissioning and testing is currently underway.
During Stage 2, AEMO will monitor the syncons’ interaction with the grid and at two weeks of smooth operations will progressively lift constraints currently binding asynchronous generators in South Australia.
Stage 3 comprises an extended monitoring period from 6 to 12 weeks after Stage 1, during which time AEMO will seek to transition the state system to running “a minimum” of two synchronous, gas-fired, generators, the Market Operator says.
Before the renewables industry and investors get too excited about the unleashing of previously curtailed renewable plant, AEMO cautions that during monitoring, if it is “not satisfied with the performance of the synchronous condensers, AEMO may extend this monitoring period and [continue to] limit asynchronous generation in SA”.
The research and modelling of the effects of the syncons, however, are expected to be borne out — allowing old-tech synchronous condensers take a respected, if not heroic place in the energy-transition landscape.

Announced last July, the plan includes a $66.3 million renewable-energy package, designed to help foster resilience, create sustainable jobs in localised renewables businesses and help power the state out of the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.
In Derby, $5.2 million has already stretched a long way: engaging the Indigenous-owned Remote Solar Solutions to install 283 kW of rooftop solar on 13 of the Derby/West Kimberley Shire buildings, and funding the installation of 1,100 smart LED streetlights which have improved night-time visibility and safety for pedestrians and drivers in the area.
Smart streetlights allow Horizon Power, the state-government-owned regional electricity supplier, to monitor and respond to faults and outages as they occur.
The jewel in the crown of the Derby Solar, Battery and Smart Streetlights project is the community swimming pool’s new custom-made solar shade, which supports a 40kW solar system that will reduce the facility’s operating costs, and provide a cool community space for the pool’s 20,000 annual visitors.
“I’m incredibly proud that we are able to deliver these meaningful outcomes and renewable energy solutions in support of Derby’s vibrant community,” said Horizon Power CEO Stephanie Unwin, honouring the completion of these project milestones in front of a community artwork framed by the new solar shade.
The seven-metre mural, Derby Drift, painted by local artist Jessica Bidewell with the help of more than 50 of the region’s children, shows the underwater wildlife of the area, and also came under the auspices of the clean-energy project.
Unwin said this “special collaboration undertaken by Horizon Power, Jessica Bidewell, the Derby Youth Centre and Derby’s young artists” will become a “legacy of pride” for the community.
A statement from Bill Johnston, WA’s Minister for Energy, said that the solar projects enabled so far in Derby will “save the Shire an average of $170,000 per year in electricity costs and help reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 460 tonnes annually”.
Still to come in the Derby project are 346 kW of solar to be installed at Derby Hospital, which will operate in tandem with a community battery — “to ensure the hospital can benefit from solar without impacting the ability of the local community to access renewable energy”, said a statement from Horizon Power, which expects these installations to be finalised early next year.

Abu Dhabi-based renewable energy group Masdar and Indonesian energy company PT PJB have reached financial closing for the 145 MW Cirata Floating Photovoltaic Power Plant on a 225ha section of the Cirata Reservoir in West Java, for which the two companies secured a long-term power purchase agreement with local state-owned electricity company Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) in January 2020.
Construction on the plant has now started and its completion is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2022. Once finalized, the project should become the country’s and Southeast Asia’s largest floating PV plant.
According to the report Indonesia Energy Transition Outlook 2021, which was recently published by the Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR), the facility will sell power at a tariff of US$0.0581/kWh. The report also revealed that PT Indonesia Power tendered, last year, two floating PV projects with capacities of 60 MW and 90 MW, respectively, and final prices came in at US$0.0374/kWh and US$0.0368/kWh, respectively.
Indonesia, with more than 17,000 islands and 100 reservoirs – plus 521 natural lakes – is planning a further 60 floating PV installations as it chases a target of having 23% of its power generated by renewables by 2025, and 31% by 2030.
Last month, Singaporean solar developer Sunseap has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Batam Indonesia Free Zone Authority (BP Batam) – which is the public authority responsible for the management, development, and construction on the island of Batam in Indonesia – for the construction of a 2.2 GW PV floating project at the Duriangkang Reservoir in the southern part of the region.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/09/looking-beyond-5-minute-settlement-to-tariff-models-that-show-how-flexible-energy-retailers-can-be/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,COVID-19,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"AUGUST 9, 2021",Looking beyond 5-minute settlement to tariff models that show how flexible energy retailers can be,"As Australia’s National Electricity Market moves toward five-minute settlement on 1 October, many energy retailers are grappling with the technology needed to reconcile customer use with energy spot market prices within the new interval. One software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider from New Zealand considers this just one of many changes in energy regulation coming down the pike, and is bringing its cloud-based, flexible energy billing platform that enables retailers to design innovative pricing packages tailored to suit constantly evolving regulations, energy mixes and different market sectors to Australia.
“While the intention behind five-minute settlement is very, very good from a demand response point of view, in that it supports new and better business models,” Jessica Venning-Bryan, Chief Customer Officer at Meridien-owned Flux Federation told pv magazine Australia, “retailers are really just focused on being compliant, rather than developing systems that allow them to innovate off the back of these changes.”
She tells the story of one retailer that spent its whole annual innovation budget, changing its systems to accommodate new energy market rules even before the advent of five-minute settlement (5MS).
5MS has evolved from a rule-change request made to the Australian Energy Market Commission by Sun Metals zinc refinery back in 2016.
After market consultations and adjustments, the AEMC in 2017 scheduled implementation of 5MS for 1 July this year — reflecting the time retailers might need to adjust their systems.
Last year, in response to a request from the Australian Energy Market Operator, the AEMC resolved to delay implementation of the new rule by three months, to 1 October 2021, because retailer resources had temporarily shifted to how to maintain services and operations under Covid-19 restrictions.
The intention of the change, from 30MS to 5MS is to provide a more accurate price signal for investment in fast-response technologies, such as batteries, new-generation gas peaker plants and demand response.
Such services, offered at prices that reflect their value to the market at any time, are vital to help stabilise the grid, says the AEMC.
Aligning operational dispatch and financial settlement at five-minute intervals, will enable a variety of energy generators, including solar owners and virtual power plants, to more efficiently bid to supply grid needs; this in turn, says the AEMC, should over time result in lower wholesale costs, which make up around a third of bills to consumers. But for many of Australia’s more than 20 tier-two energy retailers, management of the new regulation just can’t be bolted on to existing systems
“If retailers don’t innovate, they won’t provide the kind of enticing products that stimulate demand response — and enable those people who have invested in new hardware to use it to its true potential,” says Venning-Bryan.
Software, she says, is the missing link between hardware investment and energy-retail models.
Upon the launch of its FlexiBill product into the Australian market late last month, Flux Federation told pv magazine Australia that the cloud-based software had already enabled its parent company Meridian Energy (New Zealand’s largest gentailer, which supplies 35% of the country’s electricity) to grow customer numbers by 13% month on month, and increase sales by 24% over those achieved in the fourth quarter of 2020 — due to the speed at which Meridien can now deploy new propositions.
The company says it anticipates that FlexiBill will allow, “Australian retailers to reprice multiple connections within 30 seconds and speed up billing processes by up to 230%”.
Venning-Bryan adds, “We’ve really changed the way billing software is created, so it can easily be used to design a new tariff for any type of new technology; it can use any sort of consumption data; and support any sort of commercial construct a retailer could think of.”
Rather than having to retrofit new tariff models to existing software systems, this flexible SaaS offering supports fast testing and tailoring of bespoke models, for residential and commercial and industrial clients, as well as for virtual power plants and power purchase agreements.
Retailers can “get a new tariff to market in less than five minutes”, claims Venning-Bryan, “and learn very quickly whether the market wants it or not”.
From the customer perspective, she says, many are “still suffering from receiving multiple bills for multiple types of products that they’re buying from the retailer; this product can roll up all those commercial arrangements into a single bill”.
Agricultural customers who might have a solar-powered homestead or irrigation, grid powered chilling or threshing and some gas-powered processes could receive one integrated bill that’s both simpler and more transparent in terms of cost-benefit comparisons.
Commercial and industrial consumers may have a combination of PPA, or onsite solar, and gas used for high-temperature processes. Integrated billing that incorporates time-of-day energy costs lets them more easily understand the advantages of perhaps adjusting their schedules to take advantage of periods of high renewable generation.
Venning-Bryan says such billing supports customers in understanding and realising the benefits of their investments in renewable energy.
“The uptake of solar energy in Australia has been extraordinary, and the uptake of batteries is forecast to really ramp up over the next three years,” she says, adding that such distributed resources are playing an increasingly important role in electricity supply.
“The investments that companies and individuals are making will become even more powerful in the market and retailers need to be there, supporting those investments with more interesting products and tariffs,” posits Venning-Bryan.
With algorithms deployed to do the heavy lifting of calculation and reconciliation in a cloud environment that can handle the vastly increased quantities of data required for 5MS compared to 30MS, new regulations could look more like the opportunities they’re intended to create.

Photovoltachromic devices (PVCDs) are capable of enabling adjustable transparency glazing and, at the same time, generate electricity by means of the PV effect. This technology has been so far applied to the design of self-powered smart windows for buildings and vehicles at research level and, however, it is still at a very early stage of development. The ability to modulate indoor light and heat transmission, while generating energy from PVs, is enticing for further BIPV developments.
Researchers in China have now taken a further step by developing a solar window based on a photovoltachromic device that combines a full-transparent perovskite photovoltaic device and electrochromic components based on ion-gel in a vertical tandem architecture without any intermediated electrode.
“This full-transparent monolithic smart window possesses not only full advantages of self-power, on-demand control and self-adaptive based on solar-irradiances, but also good features including excellent visible transparency and colour neutrality, high adjustable range on transmittance and temperature, as well as repeatable serviceability,” the scientists stated
The Chinese group used visibly transparent perovskite and flexible electrochromic ion-gel to connect two terminals of PV element and two terminals of the electrochemical element in a four-terminal configuration. The perovskite layer was based on hybrid methylamine lead chloride (MAPbCl3) perovskite film prepared by a spin coating method.
The monolithic PVCD device was assembled via a full solution process in an architecture incorporating glass, a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) layer, the perovskite-based PV cell, the electrochromic gel, another FTO layer, and glass. This design, according to the researchers, offers the possibility of building large-area devices with a surface of approximately 36 cm2. The electrochromic gel has a thickness of around  90 μm and the PV component of around 800 nm. The PV module consists of a 300 nm electron transport layer (ETL), a 350 nm perovskite layer, and a 40 nm hole-transport layer (HTL). When the PVCD is hit by sunlight, the PV module provides voltage to charge the electrochromic module.
“By optimizsng the halide-diffusion period for perovskite, we successfully achieved a self-adaptable adjustment on transmittances depending on varying solar irradiation intensities for this monolithic PVCD,” the study reads. The PVCD is claimed to achieve a high pristine transmittance up to 76% and to be self-adaptable to control indoor brightness and temperature automatically depending on different solar irradiances.
A full description of the device can be found in the paper Full-frame and high-contrast smart windows from halide-exchanged perovskites, which was recently published in Nature Communications. The research group includes scientists from China’s Nanjing Tech University and the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
