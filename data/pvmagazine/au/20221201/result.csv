The solar farm is expected to commence commercial operations for its full capacity in early 2023.
Developed on a 410-hectare site about 10 kilometres northeast of the town of Miles, the Columboola Solar Farm comprises 410,000 bifacial solar panels mounted on single-axis trackers. When it achieves full capacity, the solar farm will generate approximately 440 GWh of clean energy annually, enough to power the equivalent of 100,000 households.
Owned by South Korea-based investment manager Hana Financial Investment, the project is backed by a long-term Power Purchase Agreement with Queensland government-owned utility CS Energy.
CS Energy will buy 100% of the site’s output, on-selling to its large commercial and industrial customers. Among the beneficiaries of the 10-year PPA is a group of universities including Griffith University, Central Queensland University and Queensland University of Technology (QUT).

Griffith University Chief Operating Officer Peter Bryant welcomed the start of commercial operations, saying all five of the university’s campuses will use power from the Columboola Solar Farm, which will provide 50% of the university’s energy needs.
“Griffith uses about 60 million kilowatt hours annually, contributing to around 70% of the university’s total carbon footprint,” he said. “It will also help us achieve our commitment of halving our 2010 emissions by 2030 and then to net zero emissions by 2050.”
Bryant added that projects like the Columboola Solar Farm are vital as universities are major consumers of electricity and have a relatively small geographic/rooftop footprint making it difficult to install enough solar or other renewable sources of power on campus.
“Off-site renewable generation via long-term power purchase arrangements means we can source renewable power when on-site options are insufficient to meet our needs and also provide essential market support for investment in new renewable projects across the state,” he said.

QUT Vice-Chancellor Professor Margaret Sheil said the Columboola Solar Farm will supply the university with enough renewable energy to cover 50% of the requirements at its Gardens Point and Kelvin Grove campuses.
Sheil said the tailored retail contract would provide QUT with a pathway to achieve full carbon neutrality on total electricity consumption, reducing the university’s carbon emissions by an estimated 20,000 tonnes per annum.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the project will play an important role in the state reaching its target of 70% renewable energy by 2032, and 80% by 2035.

Sydney-based Energy Estate said the HyNQ project would utilise “large-scale renewable energy generation” developed on site to power a “global-scale” green hydrogen and ammonia production facility with a view to export to countries such as Japan and South Korea.
Energy Estate said its new project partners will help take the project to its next stage, funding a pre-front-end engineering design (FEED) study on the feasibility of producing and exporting green ammonia from the Port of Abbot Point near Bowen.
The consortium includes Idemitsu Australia, a subsidiary of Japanese oil and gas giant Idemitsu Kosan, and Queensland government-owned electricity generator CS Energy.
“Bringing together a group of highly respected energy companies, each focussed both on the domestic opportunities for Queensland and key export markets of Japan and Korea will help accelerate the potential of HyNQ,” Energy Estate co-founder Vincent Dwyer said.
The project proponents have already completed scoping studies and initial grid connection investigations and plan to harness the benefits of existing infrastructure, while drawing on the experienced workforce and supply chain of north Queensland.
It is expected the pre-FEED activities will be completed in the second half of 2023 and, if all goes well, the project will proceed to a final investment decision in late 2024, early 2025, with hydrogen and ammonia production commencing in 2027/2028.
Idemitsu Australia Chief Executive Officer Steve Kovac said the project is a major opportunity for north Queensland and Australia’s energy transition.
“We are excited to partner with Energy Estate and other consortium members to examine the feasibility of manufacturing and exporting green hydrogen and ammonia,” he said. “The study is a critical step to supply low-carbon energy solutions and forms part of the HyNQ project to build infrastructure to support green industries and deliver a pathway for green hydrogen and ammonia production.”
The HyNQ project adds to Energy Estate’s growing portfolio of renewable energy developments, including plans to team with Melbourne-based Sunshine Hydro to develop several large-scale pumped hydro energy storage projects in Victoria integrating green hydrogen production and new renewable generation capacity.
That joint venture builds on the existing partnership between the companies in Queensland where they are jointly developing a “superhybrid” project which would incorporate 1.8 GW of wind generation and 600 MW of pumped hydro with 18 hours of storage. The Djandori gung-i project, being developed near Miriam Vale in central Queensland, would also include 300 MW of hydrogen electrolysers, 50 MW of liquefaction, and a 50 MW hydrogen fuel cell.
Energy Estate has also announced plans to develop 1.6 GW green hydrogen network in the New South Wales Hunter region.

Work on the first of the stand-alone 100 MW solar farms, which will require the installation of about 225,000 solar panels, is expected to commence in 2023 with Rio Tinto anticipating the project will be finished and in the commissioning phase by 2025. The second of the solar farms is due to come online a year later.
Initial funding for the first of the PV projects and associated transmission infrastructure has already been ticked off with final capital approval expected in the second quarter of 2023. The miner said it has also commenced talks with the WA government and traditional owners about securing the relevant approvals and required land on the Pilbara coast for the projects.
The new solar and storage is in addition to the 34 MW of PV already installed at Rio Tinto’s recently commissioned Gudai-Darri iron ore mine. The addition forms part of the mining giant’s previously announced plan to develop a 1 GW solar and wind power operation in the Pilbara as part of a global commitment to invest approximately USD 7.5 billion to halve emissions by the end of the decade.

The company said this will include significant investment in transmission infrastructure to support full decarbonisation of the Pilbara including electrification of the miner’s mobile and rail equipment beyond 2030, which is estimated to require up to 3 GW of installed renewable energy assets.
“The Pilbara is extremely well-positioned to take advantage of renewable power with land, access to people, and abundant wind and solar resources,” Rio Tinto Iron Ore Chief Executive Simon Trott said.
“We expect to invest around USD 3 billion to install renewable energy assets as well as transmission and storage upgrades in the Pilbara as part of our commitment to halve our emissions from the Pilbara by the end of this decade,” he said.
The new projects combined are expected to abate around 300,000 tonnes of carbon emissions, equivalent to a 10% reduction in total Scope 1 and 2 emissions from Rio Tinto’s iron ore business in the Pilbara based on 2021 levels.
Rio Tinto expects the projects will reduce its gas bill by approximately USD 55 million per annum at current prices and cut its gas consumption in the Pilbara by about 30%.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/01/rooftop-system-with-pv-panels-mini-wind-turbines-in-the-netherlands/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,NETHERLANDS",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"DECEMBER 1, 2022","Rooftop system with PV panels, mini wind turbines in the Netherlands","From pv magazine Global
Ibis Power, a Dutch renewables architecture specialist, has developed a hybrid solar and wind power system for the rooftops of buildings with at least fives floors. The company claims the ready-made system can produce six to 10 times more electricity than standalone rooftop solar.
“PowerNEST accelerates the wind flow into the turbines increasing their output by 4 times, but also increases the power output of the solar panels by 30% to 40% by directing the wind to actively cool the panels from the bottom,” Ibis Power CEO Alexander Suma told pv magazine.
The modular solution includes a row of 3 kW wind turbines topped with bifacial panels that capture light reflections inside its white cladding. Each module measures 7.2 metres by 7.2 metres, with a height of 4.8 metres. The company has already installed the solution in five projects across the Netherlands, most recently in the HaasjeOver building in Eindhoven.
The HaasjeOver installation includes 10 PowerNEST modules. Overall, it has 240 bifacial, 396 W solar panels and 56 335 W monofacial panels, for an annual power output of 116 MWh. It includes four 3 kW wind turbines with annual outputs of 24 MWh, bringing the total solar and wind output to 140 MWh/year. This covers 85% of the tower’s energy needs, said Suma.
The PowerNEST is installed a few metres high from the rooftop, so it covers more rooftop space than is otherwise available.
“The roof before installation only had space for approximately 40 solar panels which needed to be fit in between the ventilation pipes, other utilities, roof edges, and their shadow,” Suma explained. “This would generate only 11 MWh/year to 12 MWh/year, which is 10 times less than with PowerNEST.”
The €800,000 (AUD 1.23 million) HaasjeOver project was delivered as a turnkey solution.
“These are the actual cost of such a project if you want to make it structurally safe, use long-lasting materials and meet the building code,” said Suma.
He said that he expects costs to decrease as the company continues to expand. Ibis Power is currently developing 12 more PowerNEST projects in the Netherlands and is expanding into the rest of Europe and the United States.
