https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/30/shutting-australias-dirtiest-coal-plant-a-decade-early-wont-jeopardise-electricity-supply/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",,"SEPTEMBER 30, 2022",Shutting Australia’s dirtiest coal plant a decade early won’t jeopardise electricity supply,"This is significant for the Australian electricity industry. Loy Yang A provides around 30% of Victoria’s power and is Australia’s largest single emitting industrial facility.
But while the announcement has made headlines, it comes as no surprise. The power station burns brown coal which, while cheap, is an inefficient and emissions-heavy source of electricity. Brown coal-fired power stations are also failing to compete with the gathering pace of renewables.
AGL promises to replace the electricity provided by Loy Yang A with large-scale renewables and firming generation (such as batteries). This is, in my view, the most important commitment, because it’ll help ensure Australians have reliable electricity in the decades to come.
AGL emits more than 40 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent each year. Its announcement to bring forward Loy Yang A’s closure is no doubt largely in response to consumer and shareholder views that the electricity sector must decarbonise.
Consumers are voting with their feet and increasingly demanding electricity sourced from renewable generation. Indeed, Woolworths, BHP and Aldi are just a few high profile brands that have committed to buying 100% renewable energy.

The announcement comes amid a big week of energy news. The Queensland government released its Energy Plan, which promises to shift the state to 70% renewable energy by 2032 and 80% by 2035. The plan involves an estimated A$62 billion of investment in the energy system up to 2035.
Meanwhile, the Victorian government announced plans for 2.6 GW of new energy storage capacity by 2030, jumping to 6.3 GW by 2035.
This is all against the backdrop of the federal government’s commitment to have 82% renewables in the Australian grid by the end of the decade.
Loy Yang A is in the Latrobe Valley, which has enormous reserves of very cheap brown coal. Brown coal is physically difficult to export, so the cost of brown coal electricity generation remains very low, even at times of high international energy prices.
But these advantages are more than offset by brown coal’s major disadvantage: it is one of the least efficient and most emissions intensive types of electricity generation.
The Victorian government has a legislated target of 50% renewable energy for the state by 2030. Such significant investments in new renewables have undermined the viability of brown coal fired power stations.
And the wave of investment is set to intensify. The Victorian government has committed to 2 gigawatts of offshore wind by the end of the decade, and a total of 9 gigawatts by 2040. In terms of energy output, this is the equivalent of two Loy Yang A power stations.

But it is Australia’s love for rooftop solar that has really undermined the economics of brown coal.
Around 30% of homes in Australia have rooftop solar panels. In fact, the total capacity of rooftop solar is now almost equal to the entire remaining capacity of coal fired generation.
When the sun is shining, rooftop solar significantly reduces the amount of electricity demand from the national grid. This forces coal-fired generators to reduce their energy output significantly. In the evening, when electricity demand peaks, coal-fired generators must then ramp up their generation again.
Coal generators weren’t built to be ramped up and down to meet demand. They were built to be switched on and left operating at their maximum output, all day every day. Operating them like a yo-yo effectively ages them prematurely, bringing forward major maintenance expenditure and the likely end of their operating lives.
The impact on grid-based electricity demand in South Australia is shown in the chart below. It is clear that over the past ten years, grid demand in the middle of the day has fallen substantially due to the impact of solar, making it very hard for inflexible older coal plants to compete.

While the focus has been on the closure of Loy Yang A, the more important commitment relates to AGL building the new generation required to replace it. In its Climate Transition Action Plan, AGL stated: “We will seek to supply our customer demand with [around 12 gigawatts] of additional renewable and firming capacity, requiring a total investment of up to $20 billion, before 2036.
“Our initial target is to have up to 5 GW of new renewables and firming capacity in place by 2030, funded from a combination of assets on our balance sheet, offtakes and via partnerships.”
In other words, AGL will replace Loy Yang A with a mix of wind, solar, battery storage and other firming generation that, when combined, do the same job Loy Yang A does now – provide electricity all day every day.
This is exactly what energy consumers need: a commitment to not only close a large coal-fired power station, but a complementary commitment to build the two types of technologies required to replace it on a like-for-like basis.
Some may argue AGL’s announcements are long overdue. But with Origin Energy and AGL both indicating that the future is firm renewable energy, it’s becoming ever more likely that 100% renewable electricity in Australia’s electricity grid could be achieved by the end of the decade. That’s fantastic news for consumers, and for the climate.

Gelion said the plant will be capable of producing 2 MWh of non-flow zinc-bromide batteries annually thanks in large part to the unique design of the Endure battery which allows for the use of about 70% of existing lead-acid battery manufacturing processes.
Gelion chief executive officer Hannah McCaughey said the marriage between established and new technology shows Australia could scale sovereign domestic manufacturing capacity extremely efficiently by leveraging existing processes and supply chains.
“We are delighted to be launching production of our breakthrough battery, proving it can be produced at scale with existing lead-acid battery manufacturing processes,” she said. “This milestone is a significant step forward in Gelion’s growth strategy and also strengthens our position in the rapidly expanding energy storage market.”
Figures provided by Gelion show the value of the global battery energy storage market will reach $265 billion by 2026. Lithium-ion technology currently dominates the market but supply chain issues, skyrocketing prices for critical minerals, and a predicted global lithium shortage have encouraged the search for alternatives.

Gelion said its proprietary non-flow zinc-bromide battery technology offers a low-cost, robust, safe and recyclable alternative to lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries. The company said the production of its Endure batteries can also be scaled up on a predominantly Australian supply chain, making them ideally suited for the expanding energy storage market.
“That’s the brilliance of the technology,” McCaughey said. “Because we’ve taken a very established and very safe form of chemistry, that has been proven in being very good for long-term storage, which is six to 12 hours and we put it in a form factor of a lead-acid battery, which means that you can use the cell assembly, sealing, vacuum filling etc – so we’re using all these standard pieces of industrial equipment to manufacture our battery.”
Acciona Energía will be among Gelion’s first customers after it inked a supply deal with the Spanish renewable energy company in 2021.
“Our game-changing technology will now be deployed to Acciona to support its development of renewable battery systems,” McCaughey said.
Gelion said it is also in “advanced discussions” with other customers in the energy, resources, mining, and oil and gas sectors for trials and offtakes.
Australian Energy Minister Chris Bowen was among those who attended Friday’s launch in Sydney, describing it as “a great day for Gelion”.
“This is what Australian innovation is all about, cutting-edge technology and new manufacturing opportunities, which means more well-paying local jobs and upskilling in the workforce,” he said.

FRV, which will build and operate the facility, said the Terang BESS will feature lithium-ion phosphate technology with 100 MW of energy storage capacity and two hours of duration. The battery storage system is to be coupled with grid-forming inverters, providing flexibility to the grid by storing excess electricity and dispatching it at times of high demand or grid instability.
FRV said the battery, to be built on a 1.4-hectare next to the existing terminal station at Terang in Victoria’s Western District, about 200 kilometres southwest of Melbourne, will support the state government’s efforts to achieve its renewable energy target of 50% by 2030.
Originally developed by Melbourne-based ACEnergy, the project received approval from the state government in 2021. FRV told local media this week it would continue to work with ACEnergy on finalising the permitting and connection of the project.
It is anticipated that works on site are expected will start in the second half of 2023 with the battery expected to be switched on by the end of 2024.

The project marks a milestone for FRV in Australia. The company has been active in the Australian market since 2013, delivering ~800 MW of operational PV assets across nine projects, but the Terang BESS shapes as its first standalone battery energy storage system.
FRV has already commenced construction 5 MW solar-storage hybrid power plant near Dalby in southern Queensland. The $60 million Dalby Hybrid Power Plant will comprise 2.4 MW of solar PV capacity and a 2.5 MW/5 MWh battery.
“This is one of FRV Australia most advanced BESS projects expected to be built over the next few years,” FRV Australia chief executive officer Carlo Frigerio said. “We are delighted to receive support from the Victorian government and enable the transition to a reliable renewable system with grid-forming inverters battery systems.”
Frigerio said FRV is pursuing other energy storage projects, including a 5 MW solar-storage hybrid power plant near Dalby in southern Queensland. Work has already started on the $60 million Dalby Hybrid Power Plant which will comprise 2.4 MW of solar PV capacity and a 2.5 MW/5 MWh battery.
The Terang BESS announcement comes just days after the Victorian government announced it would target 2.6 GW of renewable energy storage capacity by 2030, and 6.3 GW by 2035.
That was followed by Edify Energy announcing it had secured $119 million from the state government’s $540 million Renewable Energy Zone Fund to help finance the 125 MW/250 MWh Koorangie battery energy storage system and grid-forming inverter being installed between Bendigo and Red Cliffs, in the state’s north west.

Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the federal government is working with states and territory governments, industry, unions and consumers to provide Australians better access to modern road transport technology and ensure infrastructure and industries are ready to support the transition.
Australia is significantly behind when it comes to EVs, which represent only 2% of new cars bought in Australia last year compared to 9% globally.
Bowen said the demand is there for EVs but changes are needed to take the industry to the next level.
“At the heart of the national strategy will be a plan to improve affordability and choice for consumers by growing the Australian EV market,” he said. “This is a genuine consultation to inform the right policy settings so we can see more affordable electric vehicles on our roads.”
Bowen said the government is excited by the possibilities “right up and down the supply chain” but will initially focus on building a bigger domestic market for EVs.
“The more we have an electric vehicle market in Australia, the more that would support electric vehicle component, and indeed, potentially more in due course, manufacturing,” he said.

Transport Minister Catherine King said policy settings to “encourage Australian manufacturing of EVs, chargers and components” will be included in the final strategy, which will have a goal of increasing local manufacturing along with improving affordability and uptake, reducing emissions, increasing charging infrastructure and delivering fuel cost savings.
“But this … is really about how can we get batteries, how can we get other components needed for electric vehicles here, and if there is an industry that wants to manufacture, a company that wants to start manufacturing cars here, we will be there supporting them every single inch of the way,” she said.
King confirmed fuel efficiency standards are also on the table, with nearly 20% of Australia’s carbon emissions coming from the transport sector, making it the nation’s second-largest emitter.
The government is accepting feedback on its consultation paper until the end of October.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/30/victoria-unveils-plans-for-australias-largest-floating-solar-plant/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 30, 2022",Victoria unveils plans for Australia’s largest floating solar plant,"Wannon Water said the $1.4 million floating solar system will be installed on Brierly Basin Reservoir at Warrnambool in the state’s southwest as part of the government’s agreement with all Victorian water corporations to reach net zero emissions by 2035.
Melbourne-based firm Enervest, which has been appointed to oversee the installation of the floating solar system, said the project will comprise more than 1,200 Yingli 400 W bi-facial solar panels mounted on pontoons floated at the reservoir.
The use of bi-facial modules is expected to achieve approximately 20% better production from water reflection with the system to provide more than 500 kW of clean energy to help power pumping stations used to transfer water from the reservoir to the Warrnambool water treatment plant, about 12 kilometres north of the city.
Enervest said construction of the anchoring system is expected to commence in November. It is anticipated the installation of solar panels will begin in January with the system due to be complete by March 2023.
Water Minister Harriet Shing officially announced the project on Thursday and said it would significantly reduce power costs and reduce Wannon Water’s emissions by more than 600 tonnes per year.
“The water sector is leading the way towards a cleaner future, showing consumers and industry that we can tackle climate change and boost renewable energy use,” she said.
Wannon Water said the 500 kW floating array is part of its own commitment to reduce emissions by 40% by the year 2025 and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2030.

The utility has already rolled out a series of solar initiatives, including the installation of a 250 kW ground-mounted system at the Warrnambool Water Treatment Plant and two 100 kW systems at the Hamilton Water Treatment Plant and at the Gateway Road corporate office.
When complete, the Brierly Basin system will be the largest floating solar plant in Australia where the technology is yet to be widely adopted. Operational systems include a community-funded 100 kW floating solar array installed at the East Lismore Sewage Treatment Plant in New South Wales and a 157 kW array at the Jamestown waste water facility in South Australia.
The technology is however beginning to attract more attention with AGL Energy announcing it will explore the potential for installing floating solar on the site of its Loy Yang A power station in Victoria.
The Victorian government is also investing in more floating solar projects, providing $209,149 to install an array on a dam at Lardner Park in Gippsland.
The project, led by the Gippsland Climate Change Network, will use the “under-utilised” lake to provide power to the park while ensuring viable land for agriculture remains free, simultaneously reducing evaporation and preventing algae growth.
Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said the floating solar projects support the state government’s ambition to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.
“Renewable energy is key to meeting Victoria’s ambitious 2030 target of reducing our emissions by 50%, and it’s important essential services like water can harness this reliable and affordable new energy technology,” she said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/30/regulators-reinforce-need-for-massive-investment-in-energy-sector/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 30, 2022",Regulators reinforce need for ‘massive investment’ in energy sector,"The Energy Security Board’s (ESB) first annual update on the health of the National Electricity Market (NEM) found Australia’s main grid requires “massive physical investment and wide-ranging policy reforms” to ensure a smooth transition from fossil fuels to renewable power.
ESB chair Anna Collyer said the 2022 Health of the NEM report, released on Thursday, identifies key risks to Australia’s energy transition, including consumer affordability, and reiterates the need for large-scale investment in new transmission, renewable generation and flexible capacity.
“The energy transition is a complex coordination exercise on a national scale that will affect all parts of the supply chain,” she said.
“Events earlier this year highlighted the types of challenges we face and the bumps that can emerge due to a combination of factors including the pace and scale of change, our exposure to the volatility of global commodities markets and the accelerating retirement of thermal generation.
“We urgently need market reform and regulatory settings that encourage efficient investment for our energy future. And the ability to manage the pace of change including the exit of thermal generation.”
The ESB, which consists of key energy regulators including the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) and the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) said it would look to accelerate the delivery of projects outlined in the 2022 Integrated System Plan (ISP) released by AEMO earlier this year.
Source: AER analysis, AEMO, 2022 ISP
The market operator estimates at least 10,000 kilometres of new transmission is required to connect a nine-fold expansion of wind and solar farm capacity and a near five-fold increase in distributed solar by 2050 and to treble the firming capacity from alternative sources to coal, including utility-scale batteries, hydro storage, gas-fired generation, and smart behind-the-meter virtual power plants (VPPs).
“The NEM requires significant investment in renewable energy, flexible capacity and the transmission network to support them,” the ESB says. “Our best strategy to manage the risk of the transition is to build replacement assets quickly, while still maintaining discipline over costs, in advance of thermal generation retirements.
“This will reduce our exposure to the shocks of international gas and coal price movements, reduce our reliance on ageing assets and allow consumers to benefit from strongly connected, geographically diverse renewable energy resources.”
The ESB report was released alongside the Australian Energy Regulator’s (AER) State of the Energy Market 2022 report which also identifies energy affordability as a major challenge in Australia’s transitioning energy market, while highlighting the increasing role rooftop and utility scale solar PV are playing in the NEM.
AER chair Clare Savage said wholesale prices were relatively low at the start of 2021, but a perfect storm of supply constraints, high international coal and gas prices, and increased demand caused costs to surge, resulting in record and persistent high prices and an unprecedented suspension of the entire wholesale electricity spot market in June 2022.

“We’ve seen record wholesale energy prices in July, but network costs are also likely to increase as inflation and rising cost of capital impact the cost of network investments that will be needed to support an orderly decarbonisation of the energy system,” she said.
“In these tough economic conditions, we are focused on using our regulatory levers to get the best possible outcomes for consumers to ensure the energy transition is delivered at least cost.”
The 225-page State of the Market report reveals the scope of the transformation that Australia’s energy markets are undergoing.
“The NEM is moving from a centralised system of large fossil fuel generation towards an array of smaller scale, widely dispersed wind and solar generators, hydroelectric generation, grid-scale batteries and demand response,” the AER says. “We have observed over the last 12 months that the transition continues to accelerate.”
As of 1 January 2022, rooftop systems in the NEM totalled more than 14 GW of capacity, making it second largest fuel type by capacity after black coal (~17GW). By mid-2022 this total had increased to more than 15 GW. About 30% of Australian houses have rooftop solar, a larger share than in any other country.
Output from rooftop solar across the NEM in the first six months of 2022 was 19% higher than the same period in 2021. Output in 2021 had already increased by 24% compared with the year prior.
Large-scale solar output also reached record levels with 18 solar farms, or almost 1.6 GW entering the market in 2021. In the last quarter of 2021, large-scale solar generation had the highest quarterly output on record – up a massive 41% from a year previous.

Battery energy storage has also ramped up, with four grid-scale batteries totalling over 500 MW entering the NEM in 2021. This took the total number of big batteries in the NEM to nine with a combined capacity of more than 800 MW. The AER said an additional 1,700 MW of battery capacity is committed to enter the NEM by 2025. Small-scale battery installations also increased in 2021, rising by 33% compared with 2020.
The AER said the rapid influx of grid and rooftop solar has changed the shape of wholesale electricity prices and demand for baseload generation during the day. These changing conditions, backed by the global investor and local push to decarbonise, are compromising the economic viability of the NEM’s 16 remaining coal-fired power stations with many of these power plants now slated to close earlier than previously announced.
While five coal-fired power plants, totalling approximately 8 GW of the current 23 GW of coal-fired capacity, has already been announced to withdraw by 2030, the Australian Energy Market Operator suggests this number will be closer to 14 GW. That is, it expects 60% of current coal-fired capacity will withdraw by 2030.
The reports came the same day as the country’s largest power producer AGL Energy announced it was bringing forward the closure of its coal-fired generation by 10 years to 2035 and would invest $20 billion in renewable energy to help replace that capacity.
Earlier this week, the Queensland government said it would shut all its coal-fired plants by 2035 and invest $62 billion with the private sector on renewable energy.

The station is expected to start operations in mid-October, following its approval by the Chinese National Energy Administration in 2016. The technology was developed by the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP), under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The first phase of the project has a capacity of 100 MW/400 MWh, for an investment of about CNY 1.9 billion ($410 million). The second phase of the project is expected to push the full capacity to 200 MW/800 MWh. That will bring the total investment to CNY 3.8 billion ($820 million), according to the Chinese Energy Storage Alliance.
The Dalian Flow Battery Energy Storage Peak-shaving Power Station will perform peak shaving and valley-filling grid auxiliary services, to offset the variability of the city’s solar and wind energy supply.
Solar and wind will be used to charge the station’s batteries during the grid load valley period by converting electrical energy into battery-stored chemical energy. Later, at peak grid load, the stored chemical energy will be converted back into electrical energy and transmitted to users.
