Scully-Power, who became the first Australian-born person to leave Earth when he served as a payload specialist aboard the 13th flight of NASA’s Space Shuttle program during the 1980s, said the concept of building solar farms in space has been discussed for decades but it has only recently become a viable solution.
“Advances in space technologies and our growing capability in building and launching reliable satellites have now made it feasible to build a solar farm that is based in Earth’s orbit, harnessing the sun’s energy and beaming it down to Earth 24/7,” he said.
Scully-Power, who now serves as the New South Wales (NSW) government’s space industry ambassador and the NSW Smart Sensing Network’s (NSSN) special envoy for space and defence, said orbit-based solar farms would benefit from higher solar illumination unfiltered by the atmosphere, or even permanent sunlight in some orbits.

The space solar farms would likely look like a spacecraft made of connected satellites. The satellites would hold arrays of solar PV panels capable of absorbing sunlight, converting it to clean energy and then transmitting it to Earth in microwave form.
“We have a company in Australia that’s working hand in glove with a company in America and they’ve already developed a design for a solar-based power system,” Scully-Power said.
“The energy can be transmitted down to any location on Earth. So for countries like Australia with rural communities, you can beam the energy directly to that community.”
The initial concept of building solar farms in space was first described by Russian and Soviet rocket scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in the 1920s.
In the late 1960s American scientist and aerospace engineer Dr Peter Glaser envisioned a way to harness solar power in space and transmit it to Earth via microwaves. He received a patent for the idea in 1973. The United States government reportedly spent millions studying it, only to conclude that it was too complex and expensive.

Scully-Power said the economic equation has now changed with rising energy prices paving the way for space-based solar to be supplied to the market at competitive prices.
“Advances in space technologies have a crucial role to play as well,” he said. “For instance, it is much cheaper to build satellites and launch them into space nowadays than it was 10 years ago.
“Space solar power gives us continuity of supply for almost 100% of the time and it is infinitely cheaper than anything that we’re using now.”
Solar PV is already the primary energy source for space hardware and infrastructure, but previous technologies have been heavy and often expensive to manufacture. That is fast changing with new solutions, including printable solar cells and perovskites promising lower costs and a higher power-to-weight ratio which is critical in equipment that must be launched against Earth’s gravity.
Scully-Power is not alone in his support for space-based solar energy with the European Space Agency (ESA) issuing a call for new ideas for technologies and concepts to increase the feasibility of the concept.

The ESA’s campaign attracted 85 ideas with four of those shortlisted and invited to submit a co-funded research proposal.
Scully-Power said the growing demand for energy meant the case for space-based solar would only get stronger.
He said although the energy sector continues to develop and deploy innovative solutions to increase extraction efficiencies and improve operational processes, the demand for energy is well above what Earth’s capable of supplying.
“We’re talking about using space as an enabler in many, many industries,” he said. “In 100 years, we will need to produce at least four times more energy than we do today to meet our population’s energy demands.
“It is vital for Australia to consider our energy supply chain from both a strategic and a climate-conscious perspective if we are to maintain our present standard of living and protect our environment.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/14/worlds-biggest-solar-plus-battery-project-gets-210m-funding-boost/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY,SINGAPORE",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 14, 2022",World’s biggest solar-plus-battery project gets $210m funding boost,"Sun Cable, which plans to supply renewable electricity to Darwin and Singapore from a massive solar PV farm and battery energy storage facility in Australia’s Northern Territory, has reached another milestone with iron ore magnate Andrew Forrest and tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes contributing to a $210m capital raising.
Project developer Sun Cable announced at the weekend it had raised $210 million in a Series B capital raising with Forrest, through his private company Squadron Energy, and Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures among the existing investors to take part.
Sun Cable is seeking to develop a giant solar and battery complex in the Northern Territory. The $30 billion-plus Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPowerLink), being developed on a 12,000-hectare site at Powell Creek in the Barkly region, includes a solar farm with up to 20GW of solar generation and between 36GWh and 42GWh of energy storage.
The intercontinental project will supply power to Darwin and to Singapore via a 4,200-kilometre high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission network, including a 750km overhead transmission line from the solar farm to Darwin and a 3,800km HVDC submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore. The project is expected to generate enough renewable electricity to power more than 3 million homes a year.
Sun Cable chief executive David Griffin said the latest funding will underpin early development work and “will take us all the way through to the financial close of the Australia-Asia PowerLink”, targeted for late 2023.
“It will also allow us to accelerate development of our broader portfolio,” he said. “Our mission is to supply renewable electricity from resource-abundant regions to growing load centres at scale.”
Griffin said the company plans to explore other “multi-gigawatt” solar projects based on the know-how developed since the AAPowerLink was first announced in 2019.
“Sun Cable has developed unique intellectual property to facilitate the optimal design of complex dispatchable renewable electricity generation and transmission projects,” he said.

“We have developed a world-leading capability in four short years. We are thrilled to have materially strengthened our resources with the support of all of our shareholders, who are such strong advocates for our mission.
“This capital raise will enable the delivery of renewable solar power from Australia to Singapore, advance our other multi-gigawatt scale projects, and support the progress of key facilitating assets.”
Griffin did not reveal where the other projects would be located, only that more details are likely to be announced “some months from now”.
Cannon-Brookes, the co-founder of software firm Atlassian, said the capital raise, the first for Sun Cable since late 2019, “brings Australia one step closer to realising our renewable energy potential”.
“We can power the world with clean energy and Sun Cable is harnessing that at scale,” he said.
“It’s a blueprint for how we export energy across the world. We fully back this vision.”
Construction of the key elements of the AAPowerLink project is expected to begin in early 2024 with the first power to be supplied to Darwin in 2026. The first supply of electricity to Singapore is expected in 2027 with full capacity expected by the end of 2028.

The project, which is anticipated will be capable of supplying up to 15% of Singapore’s electricity needs, has already secured key approvals with the Australian federal government awarding it Major Project Status while the Indonesian government has approved the submarine transmission cable route and granted approval to undertake the next stage of the subsea cable survey.
Sun Cable has also reached agreement with a powerhouse line-up of international engineering and advisory companies, including United States-based engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) giant Bechtel, North American transmission specialist Hatch, professional services firms Marsh and PwC Australia, and Australia-headquartered engineering outfit SMEC, to help it deliver the project.
Forrest said he expects Sun Cable’s vision to “transform Australia’s capability to become a world-leading generator and exporter of renewable electricity and enable decarbonisation”.
“I’m proud to be a cornerstone investor in Sun Cable, its team and its vision,” he said.
“This capital raise is a critical step in developing the Australia-Asia PowerLink and I applaud Sun Cable realising this mission.”
Sun Cable expects the AAPowerLink project will produce as much as $2 billion a year in exports, create more than 1,500 jobs in construction, 350 operational jobs, and 12,000 indirect jobs.

“And that’s a wrap,” the company said in a social media post. “Another successful project completed. The final solar panel has been installed at the 120MW Hillston Solar Farm by the Tranex Solar team, and energisation on this project is well underway.”
Developed by the Australian arm of Canadian clean energy investment firm Amp Energy, the Hillston Solar Farm is expected to generate approximately 235GWh of clean energy per year, the equivalent annual power consumption of approximately 48,000 households, when it begins full production.
The project will connect to the National Electricity Market (NEM) via Essential Energy’s Hillston sub-station which is adjacent to the 393-hectare project site just south of Hillston.
The Hillston project continues Amp’s growth in Australia after it achieved commercial operations last year with the 39MWdc Molong Solar Farm.
The Canada-based renewable energy infrastructure manager, developer, and owner has also revealed plans to build a flagship 1.3GW Renewable Energy Hub of South Australia. The $2 billion hub is to include large-scale solar projects at Robertstown, Bungama and Yoorndoo Ilga totalling up to 1.36GWdc of generation supported by a total battery energy storage capacity of 540MW.
The energisation of the Hillston Solar Farm comes after new data compiled by international consultancy firm Rystad Energy showed the 40MW Greenough River Solar Farm in Western Australia (WA) was the best performing solar asset in the country in February.

Rystad Energy senior analyst David Dixon said Bright Energy Investments’ Greenough River Solar Farm near Geraldton in the state’s mid-west was Australia’s best performing utility solar PV project last month, with a capacity factor of 37.6%.
Built in 2012, the original 10MW Greenough River in Western Australia was the first large-scale solar farm in the country. The asset’s generation capacity has since been boosted with a 30MW expansion recently completed.
SUN Energy’s 100MW Merredin Solar Farm, which was the nation’s top performing utility scale solar PV asset in 2021, finished second for the month with the power plant in WA’s central Wheatbelt returning an average capacity factor (CF) of 37.6%.
German investment company Wirtgen Invest’s 149MWp Glenrowan West Solar Farm in northern Victoria rounded out the top three solar farms for the month of February with an average capacity factor of 37.4%.
Dixon said utility scale solar PV and wind assets generated a combined total of 3,347GWh last month, up 24% on the 2,700GWh generated in February 2021.
NSW was the top performing state for the month, generating 967GWh of utility PV and wind generation, followed by Victoria (842GWh) and South Australia (580GWh).
The top utility wind asset was Powering Australian Renewable’s 200MW Silverton wind farm in NSW (51.9% CF), ahead of DIF’s Warradarge Wind Farm (50.4% CF) in WA.

The 16th staging of the biennial event will be held from 20-27 October 2023. It will mark a return for the race after the 2021 event was cancelled amid international border closures sparked by the Covid-19 pandemic.
First contested in 1987, the World Solar Challenge is exclusive to vehicles powered only by solar energy. Participants are required to engineer, manufacture and race a solar-powered car from Darwin to Adelaide, a 3,000km journey along the Stuart Highway which snakes its way through the harsh Australian outback.
Each of the solar-powered cars will be engineered, built and driven by teams from schools and universities across the globe.
“Crossing a continent on the power of the sun really is the ultimate adventure,” World Solar Challenge event director Chris Selwood said.
Selwood said the race continues to exceed expectations with the best of the solar vehicles capable of covering distances of up to 1,200km without charging from the grid.
“That’s superior to most electric vehicles (EV) on the market today,” he said, adding that each staging of the event raises the bar with the regulations made increasingly difficult.
For the 2019 event, each participating team had to create a car using no more than six square metres of solar panels and were only allowed up to 5kW hours of stored energy.
The regulations for the 2023 event are expected to be released next month, with event registration to open in June.

The event features two main categories: The Challenger Class and Cruiser Class. The Challenger Class uses only the sun for power and vies for outright victory, while the Cruiser Class brings green technology to the mainstream and can charge from the grid on two occasions – highlighting the relevance to EV development.
Taka Horio, director of motorsport with event sponsor Bridgestone, said the World Solar Challenge provides a great chance for participating teams to develop and showcase solutions that can help improve the future of sustainable mobility.
“The event provides an invaluable opportunity,” he said. “The Bridgestone World Solar Challenge leads to enhancement of technologies, innovation and solutions that tackle social and environmental issues.”
The 2019 event, which attracted a record 43 teams from 21 countries, was won by the Agoria Solar Team.
The Belgian team’s BluePoint car clocked an average speed of 86.6km per hour to cross the line first ahead of a team from Japan’s Tokai University (86.1kmh) with the team from the United States’ University of Michigan (79.6kmh) third.

OnSight Technology, a California-based startup, has developed an autonomous, tele-operated unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with a radiometric thermal imaging camera. It also has an optical zoom camera, backed by artificial intelligence, to detect, report and observe problems and anomalies in solar plants.
It is powered by solar energy and can move at a speed of 1.6 km per hour for up to 12 hours a day.
“The capabilities lead to the lowest cost and highest quality data in the industry,” said the company.
The company recently updated the solar O&M robot, which can now be booked through the manufacturer’s website. It uses 5G technology.
“It is controlled through our online portal and uses an Xbox controller,” the company said. “Setup is very simple and using the Xbox controller makes learning to move the robot extremely easy.”
OnSight Technology said that the robot can adapt to the needs of specific PV installations. The company also offers training and support to project owners.

A group of researchers from the Uppsala University in Sweden and Swedish technology company Solibro Research AB has developed a PV-powered electrolyser for water splitting that is claimed to have remarkable solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency.
Presented in the paper NiMoV and NiO-based catalysts for efficient solar-driven water splitting using thermally integrated photovoltaics in a scalable approach, published in Cell, the device is described by its creators as an electrolysis device combining copper, indium, gallium and selenium (CIGS) thin-film solar modules with an alkaline electrolyser based on a trimetallic cathodic catalyst made of nickel, molybdenum, and vanadium (NiMoV) and an anode made of nickel oxide (NiO).
In the proposed system configuration, the anodic NiO electrocatalyst is used as a counter-electrode to the NiMoV cathode. The anode and cathode of the electrolysis cell were placed in close contact with each other and separated by an anion exchange membrane and thin glass was used as the wall of the cell to enable thermal coupling and heat exchange.
“The anodic and cathodic catalysts were positioned in close connection in the design to minimise mass transport limitations in the design, where modules of the size constructed here could be assembled into arrays for larger area installations for convenient maintenance and replacement of separate modules,” the scientists explained. “The approach allows a heat transfer between the PV and electrolysis parts beneficial for improved system efficiency, where a decrease in PV efficiency from high operating temperature is compensated by increased electrolysis efficiency, and vice versa for low operating temperature.”
A 14.5%-efficient CIGS module with an area of 78cm2 was placed in thermal contact with the electrolysis device that has an active area of 100cm2. The operating voltage for the combined PV-electrolyser system was estimated at 1.63V. Nickel plates measuring 130×130×5mm were used to cover the electrolyser in order to minimise corrosion and ensure long-term stability.
The performance of the solar-powered electrolyser was evaluated with operating temperatures ranging from 25 to 50 degrees Celsius and under standard solar illumination. The champion device, built with a 4-cell solar module, was able to provide an average solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 8.5% for stable operations during 100 hours. Its maximum efficiency reached up to 9.1%. “The results in the present study bear promise toward large-scale implementations using matched integrated PV-electrolysis with stable thin-film PV materials, monolithic design, and utilization of earth-abundant catalyst components,” the researchers stated.
