Owned and operated by French renewable developer Neoen and using Tesla’s Megapack technology, the 300 MW / 450 MWh battery doubles the capacity of the previous front runner, South Australia’s Hornsdale Power Reserve.
It unlikely the Victorian big battery will keep that position for long though, given Australia’s bulging storage pipeline and the cracking pace at which the plans can be realised. The battery went into operation just 12 months after Neoen was awarded its grid services contract with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).

There can also be no denying that the days of naming the batteries by their state location followed by ‘big battery’ will soon be over – though it appears interested parties are eager to suck the last drops out of the tradition.
Located next to Moorabool Terminal Station in Geelong, the battery was declared fully operational today by Victoria’s Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change Lily D’Ambrosion and of course the Neoen team. The Andrews government said the battery will “modernise the state’s electricity grid” as well as supporting new renewable energy capacity and improving power reliability.
The government also cited “‘independent analysis”, though it didn’t mention its source, which reportedly shows every $1 invested in the battery will deliver $2.40 in benefits to Victorian households and businesses.
The battery has already drawn global attention – less for its size and more because of the drama of the fire in July which broke out during the battery’s commissioning, destroying two of the project’s 212 Tesla Megapacks.

Sparking renewed discussions around the safety of lithium-ion battery technologies, the investigation into the fire deemed the most likely cause to be a leak within the Megapack cooling system. The system in place to detect such faults didn’t set off alarms though because it hadn’t been given adequate time to ‘map’ the control system. 
The investigation returned a list of action to be taken, all of which the have reportedly been implemented.
The Victorian big battery is part of the newly introduced System Integrity Protection Scheme (SIPS) initiated by the Victorian government to bring forward critical transmission investments.
As part of the scheme, the battery has a 250 MW contract with AEMO which will see it reserve 80% of its capacity to allow the energy market operator to increase the power flow through the Victoria-New South Wales Interconnector (VNI) over the next decade of Australian summers. 

Under the contract, the battery will provide an automatic instant response in the event of an unexpected network outage, providing AEMO with an additional means of ensuring grid stability. 
Of course, the battery will also participate in electricity spot and services markets like the lucrative Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) market.
Neoen now has 2 GW of projects in its pipeline for Victoria alone, with other batteries planned for Queensland, New South Wales and another for South Australia. The company also owns and operates the Hornsdale Power Reserve, which was the world’s largest battery when it was completed back in 2017.
“The delivery of the Victorian Big Battery is a major achievement for Neoen, not only because it is one of the largest batteries in the world, but also because it represents another key milestone in terms of innovation,” Neoen’s chairman and CEO, Xavier Barbaro, said. “Our journey in storage began in Australia in 2015 and we now have over half a gigawatt of storage operating across 3 continents.”
“We are extremely proud to have delivered the largest battery in Australia in record time. I would like to thank everyone who has worked tirelessly to make this happen; our partners at Tesla and AusNet, UGL and Downer, as well as AEMO and the Victorian Government,” the company’s managing director for Australia, Louis de Sambucy, added.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/08/china-chile-spain-and-australia-will-lead-the-hydrogen-economy/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"DECEMBER 8, 2021","‘China, Chile, Spain and Australia will lead the hydrogen economy’","From pv magazine Global| the Hydrogen Stream
Four countries on four continents are expected to lead green hydrogen production in the next five years, according to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report. “If planned projects are commissioned by 2026, China, Chile, Spain and Australia could together bring 85% of the additional 18 GW of renewable capacity dedicated to green hydrogen production,” the IEA wrote. That suggests same-continent supply deals will initially drive hydrogen trading, especially in Asia and Europe.
Plans for more than 260 GW of electrolyser capacity had been announced by the end of October. “We estimate that this could bring an additional 475 GW of wind and solar PV capacity, one-third of total installed variable renewables today,” wrote the IEA, adding Europe leads in terms of planned electrolyser capacity, accounting for around 40% of the total.
Lack of demand and competition from fossil-fuel-powered ‘grey’ hydrogen could be problematic, however, the report stated. “The mismatch between currently planned projects and the demand for green hydrogen output remains a key uncertainty for future electrolyser expansion,” wrote the report’s authors.
“Government policies are currently more focused on decarbonising hydrogen production than developing demand for new applications.”
The use of hydrogen at the Port of Valencia, to reduce the environmental impact of machinery in a terminal that operates year-round, will make the site Europe’s first port to use the energy carrier for that activity, the port has claimed.
The project “has been recognised by different organisations, and which the European Commission has selected as a strategic initiative for the decarbonisation of maritime transport,” wrote the port on Thursday, adding it will install a green hydrogen supply station at the beginning of the new year.
The mobile station will supply enough hydrogen to guarantee the continuous working cycle of the equipment which is part of the European Commission-backed H2Ports project. Oxford-based power market data company Aurora Energy Research says hydrogen will play a key role in Iberian decarbonisation efforts.
“There are three key reasons for this,” wrote Aurora last month, “one, the vast potential for renewable energy in Iberia will lead to lower green hydrogen production costs than in other European regions; two, policy efforts seem to be focused on green hydrogen versus other low carbon alternatives, e.g. nuclear or CCS [carbon capture and storage]; and three, the proposed hydrogen targets are highly ambitious, creating valuable opportunities for the industry.”
French automotive supplier Plastic Omnium has said it will continue “its expansion, in the wake of its first commercial successes” in hydrogen mobility. The company wants revenue of €3 billion (AU$4.7 billion) by 2030. Last month, Plastic Omnium teamed up with U.S.-based automotive development, simulation, and testing company AVL for the development of high and medium-power hydrogen systems.
“The new partnership will enable Plastic Omnium to accelerate the commercial roll-out, as of 2022, of a range of high-performance, cost-effective hydrogen systems for use in all categories of vehicles,” read a press release published in late November.
Saudi state-owned energy company Aramco has signed five agreements with French businesses, including a commitment to explore a hydrogen-powered vehicle business with zero-emission transport company Gaussin.
Aramco and Gaussin wants to establish a manufacturing facility for hydrogen-powered vehicles in Saudi Arabia. As a first step, the partners will study the feasibility of a factory and a hydrogen distribution business to serve the Middle East.
“This partnership is a continuation of Aramco’s long-standing relationship with a number of leading French companies,” said the energy company’s CEO Amin H. Nasser. “It represents an opportunity to promote hydrogen as a low-carbon solution, not just for motorsport but eventually for mass transportation as well.”
The Saudi energy giant is diversifying its business but this week signed a US$15.5 billion (AU$21.7 billion) ‘lease and leaseback deal’ for its gas pipe network, with a consortium led by U.S.-owned BlackRock Real Assets and the Saudi state-owned Hassana Investment Company buying a 49% stake in a new Aramco subsidiary which will lease usage of the pipes, including to its parent company.

Norwegian thermoplastic composite pipe producer Strohm has signed a memorandum of understanding with German-Spanish offshore wind business Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy. “The collaboration will focus on developing hydrogen transfer solutions that improve the decentralised green hydrogen concept, whereby green hydrogen is generated in each wind turbine generator and transported to shore by a subsea pipe infrastructure,” Strohm said today.
“In this concept, power cables are replaced by a pipe infrastructure, storing and transferring hydrogen.” Strohm last month teamed up with Norwegian engineer Seanovent to work on offshore wind-to-hydrogen development. Siemens Gamesa is looking at opportunities in Scandinavia and last month struck a 455 MW deal with Swedish developer OX2 “for what will be Finland’s largest ever wind farm.”

South Korea’s Korea Gas Corp (Kogas), one of the biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) buyers in the world, will invest in hydrogen production and facilities while acquiring under-evaluated LNG assets, according to Kogas President Lee-Bong Chae.
“For economical hydrogen production and supply, we will continue to build various types of hydrogen production plants and hydrogen refuelling infrastructure, as well as actively pursue[ing] green hydrogen business overseas for hydrogen take-off,” said the executive.
“In addition, we will make very substantial R&D investments, in the form of strategic alliances with leading companies, joint R&D, and M&As [mergers and acquisitions].” According to U.S.-based financial data company S&P Global, state-controlled Kogas – which is expected to produce 1.04 million tons of hydrogen per year by 2030 – will finish its first hydrogen production plant by March 2023. The company wants to produce the energy carrier through steam reformation.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/08/agl-links-with-fortescue-to-flip-nsw-coal-generators-to-green-hydrogen/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"DECEMBER 8, 2021",AGL links with Fortescue to flip NSW coal generators to green hydrogen,"AGL Energy and Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) on Wednesday announced they would undertake a feasibility study looking into the viability of turning AGL’s two Hunter Valley coal power stations, Liddell and Bayswater, into green hydrogen production centres supported by new wind, solar, pumped hydro and batteries.
Pending the feasibility study’s outcomes, FFI said the initial renewable electricity production through new wind and solar could be 250 MW, which would be enough to generate 30,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year. “Or enough for a hydrogen fuelled truck to drive to the moon and back five times,” its statement on the news theorised. 
Ultimately, the company added, production from the facilities could reach into the gigawatts.

Over the next 12 months, the two companies plan to identify and assess key operational and commercial projections for the sites’ transformation, developing a production timeline based on their findings, FFI CEO Julie Shuttleworth said.
The broader vision, seemingly shared by FFI, AGL, and the state government alike, is that the Hunter Valley – one of the major coal regions in Australia – should be transformed into the state’s centrepiece hydrogen hub. Given Bayswater and Liddell Power Station sit less than 5km away from each other, the repurposing of both sites would be a significant part of this infrastructural shift. 
Liddell is scheduled to retire fully in 2023, with Bayswater not scheduled for closure until 2036 – though many forecast an earlier closure. AGL is progressing plans to 500 MW big battery at the Liddell site also.
Both extremely prominent players in Australia’s energy landscape, AGL and FFI sit at quite different ends of the energy transition. AGL Energy is Australia’s biggest polluter and represents the country’s energy incumbency, while Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) is relatively new, founded in 2018, but has spent those years busily making tentative green hydrogen deals globally. In the last few months, it has also announced plans to build the world’s biggest electrolyser manufacturing plant in Queensland as well as a 1 GW solar manufacturing plant, presumably also in Queensland though the location is not yet finalised. 
FFI is hardly a clean slate though as a subsidiary of billionaire Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest’s Fortescue Metal Group, which rose to power on the back of iron-ore exports. Since launching the green focussed FFI though, Forrest seems to have done an extremely radical and public 180 in his focus on climate pollution – though it could also be called shrewd business.

Whatever his inner motives, Forrest has now come together with AGL, with the feasibility studies into transforming the coal stations in fact part of a larger non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between FFI and AGL which will also see the pair assess whether green hydrogen can be used to fuel co-located industries, in addition to export options.
In its statement, FFI said the repurposing of these fossil sites would “prove” the role of green hydrogen in decarbonising and “demethaning” energy and industry here in Australia. This is probably quite attractive given Liddell and Bayswater power stations currently account for over 40% of New South Wales’ carbon dioxide emissions, according to 2019 National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting data.
The thinking is that flipping the source industry in the Hunter Valley from coal to green hydrogen would be a smart way to transition an energy-savvy workforce and build or retain subsidiary industries in the region. Of the creation of a Hunter Valley hydrogen and industry hub, FFI founder and chair, Andrew Forrest, said: “FFI’s goal is to turn regional Australia into the global green energy heartland and create thousands of jobs now and so many more in the future.
“Repurposing existing fossil fuel infrastructure with forward looking companies like AGL to create green hydrogen to help power the world, is the solution we have been looking for.
“This is another important step in turning the corner once and for all, to implement the technologies carbon emitters, like us, to reach net zero,” Forrest added.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/08/new-tool-to-understand-component-failure-rate-in-pv-related-fires/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED KINGDOM,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 8, 2021",New tool to understand component failure rate in PV-related fires,"From pv magazine Global
An international group of scientists has created a new model to identify the most significant causes of fire at the component level and various failure patterns related to fire accidents in rooftop PV systems.
“Our model is applicable to all sizes of rooftop PV, as it compares the annual number of fires with the national capacities, rather than the number of installations,” research co-author, Jens Steemann Kristensen, told pv magazine. “This makes a lot of sense, as the number of components, and thus possible sources of ignition, is assumed to be proportional with the size of the PV system.”
The proposed model is based on fault tree analysis (FTA), which is a graphical tool aimed at identifying potential causes of system failures before failures occur. FTA shows the logical relationship between a particular system failure and all its contributing causes.
The scientists said that that model initially evaluates the quantitative frequency of fire incidents caused by rooftop PV systems. They noted that the lack of quantitative data on fire accidents on a global scale is still an issue that prevents an exhaustive understanding of causes and effects in PV-related fires. A qualitative FTA analysis is then applied to assess system safety and reliability.
“The method has the potential to identify fault linkages in the system, highlight failure patterns before they arise, compare several designs for safety prioritisation, help authorities evaluate overall hazards, and take decisions to avoid critical failures,” the researchers said.
Based on previous reports from Australia, Germany and the United Kingdom, the academics identified seven major events that can cause fires in PV systems. Six of the major events were caused by electric malfunctions in the components of the PV systems, whereas the seventh major event was an unrelated external ignition source.
Electrical arcing, which occurs in PV systems when a connection is broken while the PV is producing current, was identified as the most common cause of fire in rooftop solar arrays. This phenomenon occurs due to poor-quality products, planning and installation errors, component damage during transportation, operational errors, and infrequent inspections, among other minor factors. The connector was found to be the prime contributor for arcing in 17% of the analysed PV-related fires.
“The quality of the workforce installing the PV system is assumed to have a significant influence on the failure rate,” said Steemann Kristensen.
A self-installed domestic system therefore might be more prone to failure than a high-end professionally installed commercial system, because studies have shown that professional installations on plants have higher quality. Qualitative research has also shown that annual fire incident frequency is 0.0293 fires per megawatt.
“When talking about a technology being safe or not, we talk about the risk related to the technology,” Steemann Kristensen said. “With risk being the product of probability times consequences, we must accept that the PV system affects both quality and quantity.”
He added that rooftops without PV systems are not designed to facilitate flame spread, but when a PV system is added to a roof, a semi-enclosure is created between the back of the PV modules and the upper surface of the roof.
“The introduction of a semi-enclosure is a significant change of the fire dynamic scenario, as heat from the initial fire is re-radiated back towards the surface of the roof, whereupon the fire can spread on the roof.” Steemann Kristensen stated. “It is important to emphasise, that it is not necessarily the PV system that burns, but the PV modules, as a physical object, facilitate flame spread on top of the roof construction.”
The academics also noted a recent fire accident at a Walmart facility in the United States. “This type of pitfall might have severe consequences for the society and be crucial for the implementation of PV systems into the built environment,” they said.
Steemann Kristensen said the expected consequences of the PV technology are largely positive because they contribute to higher sustainability, for example. However, to ensure continuous growth of the technology, it is essential to understand the expected and unexpected consequences, including fire-related risks, as a lack of understanding might have severe long-term consequences.
“That makes the paper very relevant, and it is therefore suggested in the conclusion of the paper that the National Fire and Rescue services implement two PV-related questions into their post-incident reports,” he concluded.
The scientists described the model in “Fault tree analysis of fires on rooftops with photovoltaic systems,” which was recently published in the Journal of Building Engineering. The research group includes scientists from Universiti Putra Malaysia, the Technical University of Denmark,  and the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom.
