Headed up by Philipp Schröder, formerly the managing director of Sonnen and Tesla’s country director in Germany, 1komma5° is backed by people behind some of the world’s biggest hitters including Porsche, Klarna, Sonnen, eCapital and Eurazeo. Which is to say, the startup’s ambitions in Australia have serious weight.
Speaking to pv magazine Australia, Chris Williams – who has now been appointed chief executive of 1komma5°’s Asia Pacific operation – described the move on Natural Solar as a “foundational acquisition in Australia that is hopefully going to redefine the industry.”

What he means by that is 1komma5’s intention is to set up not only what it is calling a ‘one stop shop’ in Australia – a company that retails and installs everything from solar, batteries, electric vehicle chargers, heat pumps and the energy management platform to integrate them into a fully optimised system – but also how it intends to grow its reach here.
1komma5° has allocated $100 million (USD 62.6 million) to make around six acquisitions in Australia within the next 18 months – replicating an expansion strategy it has employed in Europe.

“One of the challenges, but also the benefits, of Australia is just the pure size geographically of Australia,” Williams tells pv magazine Australia. This vastness of the country, alongside its maturity in terms of solar deployment, means it is home to a huge number of small to mid-sized solar businesses – something the German outfit is looking to leverage through partnerships to “really try to get that whole of country coverage,” Williams says.
“When I say partnership, I actually mean future acquisitions.”
“That EUR 65 million or $100 million that has been allocated for future investment in Australia is for the purpose of taking majority stakes in other businesses across the country that make sense geographically, with product type, abilities and key skillsets, profitability, growth and backing by strong entrepreneurs.”
The vision is for 1komma5 to break off between 25% to 35% of the market for households investing in clean technologies, Williams says.
A feat, he adds, no company has achieved to date in Australia.
Given that, Williams describes the Australian market as being “ripe” for consolidation.
“If you take the best bit of 70 or 80 companies, you’ve got a very strong outfit,” Williams says. “Essentially you take all these elements together, and you’ve got a really powerful machine that can make a significant difference across the world.”

With this strategy, the company is hoping to leverage economies of scale to supercharge its procurement abilities, giving it greater access to products and technologies. It is also seeking better operational efficiencies through elements like centralised logistics and warehousing.
Part of what 1Komma5 brings to the table, Williams says, is “the working capital to have three or four or five or six months of product in your warehouse,” which gives it far greater control over its margins.
 1komma5 has acquired 15 companies within the past year, and is already operating in 25 locations throughout Sweden, Germany, Finland, Austria and Spain, with over 750 employees. It has a planned revenue of EUR 600 million ($930 million) for 2023.
It is looking to make another 60 acquisitions or so globally in the coming year, including those in the Asia Pacific region – though Williams noted the focus  at this stage is primarily Australia and New Zealand. Thailand and the Phillipines could, in the future, hold opportunities too, Williams says.
1komma5 is planning to soon open a showroom in Sydney to showcase its range of solar, batteries, heat pumps, EV chargers as well as the German company’s signature Heartbeat energy management platform.

Heartbeat is an internet of things energy management device which controls major electrical appliances in the home. In Europe, the platform has managed to save customers up to 120% of electricity costs, according to the company.
These savings come, of course, through managing the appliances time of use, and also through what it calls “intelligent” EV car charging and as well as through virtual power plant arrangements.
“There’s not really a one stop shop in Australia that delivers all these technologies and integrates them all together,” Williams says. This integration, he adds, represents the “home of the future” and means households can maximise energy savings with one point of contact.
This feature of having a single point of contact for sale, installation and after sales service, Williams believes, will be a major drawcard for the Australian market.
“If [households] are going to be spending a large amount of money on their homes for the long term, they want certainty that the person they are getting these products from, that’s a long term relationship.”
In terms of any trepidations Australians might feel at 1komma5’s foreign roots, Williams believes German companies – and perhaps more so German technology – has well and truly earned its stripes here. He believes having had a strong presence in Australia’s solar market since its inception, not to mention in a number of other high-end technology industries, German brands are well respected and trusted.
Whether this vision of full ‘one stop shop’ integration will extend into manufacturing, Williams could not comment. He said simply that the company has key supply relationships with certain manufacturers around the world, and the intention is to continue working with them.
As for its product suite in Australia, Williams says there are already about 15 to 20 products which integrate with 1komma5’s Heartbeat and the intention is to be “product agnostic.”
Among the stocked brands there will naturally be Tesla, Sonnen, Enphase, and a number of key panel manufacturers, though Williams notes he is keen to ensure company focuses on products which work well in the Australian market.
“What I’m saying is I don’t think you need huge volume of products to cover the whole Australian market and tick the boxes of what Australia consumers really need,” Williams continued. “It’s a case of being quite targeted and having those economies of scale to invest in certain manufacturers.”

The deal was helped by the close relationship of the two companies, NovaSource having spun off from First Solar in 2021.
According to a company statement, the Australian expansion adds 500 MW of solar energy production to NovaSource’s global portfolio which includes over 20 GW of solar power plants across 11 countries.
The deal is a sign that the Australian market looks to be following the US and Europe where O&M provision is already at advanced levels of consolidation.
O&M is increasingly seen as one of the last levers through which reductions in LCOE can be achieved for PV project owners and operators, a lever that is increasingly being pulled by large companies with consolidated assets capable of thorough digitisation. By employing more advanced O&M techniques and technologies, such as digital fault analytics, advanced failure warnings, aerial (remote) imaging and automated cleaning services, existing PV projects can be made more productive.
The acquisition followed a $159 million (USD 100 million) investment in NovaSource by Omers Private Equity, the private equity arm of Omers, a Canadian pension plan for municipal employees. And it looks as if little time has been wasted in putting that capital to use as the company expands into the lucrative Australian market.
NovaSource’s president for international operations, Timo Moeller, said the company was thrilled to expand its global feet into Australia’s growing solar market.
“Our team is energised to present our current and future stakeholders through APAC a higher standard of technical services,” said Moeller.
NovaSource spun off from First Solar in 2021 and joined forces with SunPowers O&M.

The US Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, have collaborated the development of a novel fast-charging battery anode material via a scalable synthesis method. The researchers said in a recent paper in Advanced Energy Materials that a novel compound of molybdenum-tungsten-niobate (MWNO) with fast rechargeability and high efficiency could potentially replace graphite in commercial batteries. They focused on a problem that graphite anodes encounter during the charging process, when the electrolyte decomposes and forms a buildup on the anode. This buildup slows the movement of lithium ions and can limit battery stability and performance. “Because of this sluggish lithium-ion movement, graphite anodes are seen as a roadblock to extreme fast charging. We are looking for new, low-cost materials that can outperform graphite,” said ORNL postdoctoral researcher Runming Tao. The Department of Energy’s extreme fast-charging goal for EVs is set at 15 minutes or less to compete with refuel times on gas-powered vehicles – a milestone that has not been met with graphite. “This material operates at a higher voltage than graphite and is not prone to forming what is called a ‘passivation solid electrolyte layer’ that slows down the lithium-ion movement during charging. Its exceptional capacity and fast-charging rate, combined with a scalable synthesis method, make it an attractive candidate for future battery materials,” said Tao.
General Motors and EV battery developer OneD Battery Sciences have signed a joint R&D agreement focused for the potential use of OneD’s silicon nanotechnology in GM’s Ultium battery cells. GM Ventures and Volta Energy Technologies also participated in OneD’s Series C funding round, which the company recently closed at USD 25 million ($39m). The focus of the collaboration is OneD’s SINANODE platform, which adds more silicon onto the anode battery cells by fusing silicon nanowires into EV-grade graphite. Silicon can store 10 times more energy than graphite but most attempts to include more silicon in the anode faced challenges of silicon expansion and breakage. “This limited the amount used to extremely small percentages and only modest performance improvements,” OneD said. “Being able to add larger amounts of silicon – efficiently – is the essential breakthrough needed to produce competitive EVs that meet market demand for high-performance, affordable vehicles.” Under a licensing business model, GM will tap OneD’s 15-year, 240-patent track record, with a focus on increasing energy density and reducing the cost of future GM EV batteries. “GM designed Ultium to be a supremely flexible platform so we can continuously improve our cells as battery technology advances,” said Kent Helfrich, GM CTO, vice president of GM R&D. GM will scale its Ultium EV Platform to 1 million units of annual EV production capacity in North America by 2025. Earlier this year, GM’s first joint venture battery plant with LG Energy for Ultium Cells began production in Ohio, with two additional US plants now under construction and a fourth in the planning stage.
Volvo has unveiled it first electric vehicle with bidirectional charging. Its upcoming all-electric flagship SUV EX90 will support both V2G and V2H applications, so car owners will be able to decide whether to keep their electricity to power their homes or send it back to grid. The EVs will also operate as vehicle-to-load (V2L) battery storage systems. “With the Volvo EX90 you can power your life,” said Olivier Loedel, Volvo’s head of electrification ecosystem. “You could use its battery in many ways, from topping up your electric bike when you’re out and about, to hooking up an outdoor cooking appliance for your weekend camping trip. It could even power your house during the expensive peak hours of the day.” Volvo sees potential to pool EVs in virtual power plants to relieve strain on the grid and cover short periods of instability. But not all of those features and capabilities will be available in all markets, it said. “The bi-directional charging offer will initially be launched in selected markets,” said the carmaker. “We are currently investigating which use cases we will be able to offer in different markets.”
Shoals Technologies has achieved UL Standards certification for its first set of aboveground eMobility charging solutions. The listed products include its Fuel Power Center, Big Lead Assembly (BLA) for DC or AC power, raceways and quick connect bases for chargers. Shoals, a major provider of balance-of-system equipment for solar and energy storage projects, claims its system to lay cables and wires above the ground could help slash 20% of 40% off the cost of typical EV charger installations.
The European Parliament’s Transport Committee has adopted a draft negotiating mandate on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure on main EU roads. The draft aims to accelerate the expansion of the EV charging and H2 refuelling infrastructure. It wants electric charging pools for cars to be deployed at 60 kilometres intervals along major European roads by 2026. Among other proposals, the draft calls for two truck charging stations per parking place from 2028 instead of 2031, as proposed by the commission.
Hyundai and Australia’s Ampol have announced plans to expand opportunities for hydrogen infrastructure and battery EVs. Hyundai EV drivers will pay less to charge their cars at Ampol stations across its growing AmpCharge network, along with potential bundled energy offers incorporating home charging and other energy solutions. Ampol recently opened its first sites under the AmpCharge banner, marking the start of an initial rollout of 120 EV fast-charging sites at Ampol stores by the end of 2023. The companies will also collaborate on integrated solutions for fuel cell electric vehicles powered by hydrogen. They said they will also explore the development of hydrogen infrastructure and fleets.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/12/philippines-introduces-priority-dispatch-for-renewables-opens-market-to-100-foreign-investments/,"MARKETS,POLICY,PHILIPPINES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 12, 2022","Philippines introduces priority dispatch for renewables, opens market to 100% foreign investments","From pv magazine Global
The Department of Energy (DoE) of the Philippines has revealed that all renewable energy assets will be granted preferential dispatch in the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM). The DoE said that the preferential lane will be given to plants operating under the “Must Dispatch” and “Priority Dispatch” categories.
The first one is represented by all renewable energy facilities powered by wind, solar, run-of-river hydro, or ocean energy, regardless of whether they are being operated under the feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme.
“The enjoyment of ‘Must Dispatch’ is based on the difficulty to precisely predict the availability of RE resource, thereby making the energy generated variable and irregular and the availability of resource inherently uncontrollable pursuant to Section 20 of the Renewable Energy Act,” said the DoE.
The second category only covers biomass plants operating under the FIT system.
“Granting all generating units utilising RE resources either ‘Must Dispatch’ or ‘Priority Dispatch’ will aid in accelerating the development and utilisation of indigenous RE resources and reduce the dependence on imported conventional energy sources,” said Energy Secretary Carlos Jericho Petilla. “This will minimise the country’s exposure to price fluctuations in the global market, making the supply and delivery of electric power more stable and secured from international geopolitical conflicts.”
In addition, the DoE has also started to review the Renewable Energy Act, which was issued in 2008. It aims to amend the rule requiring renewable energy projects to be at least 60% owned by domestic investors.
However, local media reports suggest that the measure will help the country to achieve its renewable energy targets.
“The DoE is preparing the necessary amendments to Rule 6, Section 19 of the IRR of the RE Law,” said Lotilla.
The country plans to install 15 GW of clean energy by 2030. Recent statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency show that the Philippines had an installed PV capacity of 1.08 GW at the end of 2021. Most of the nation’s solar facilities were secured under the old feed-in tariff regime, auctions, and net metering programs.
