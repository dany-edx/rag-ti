The Accelerating Commercialisation grants are part of the government’s Entrepreneurs’ Program designed to help Australian companies grow, commercialise innovations and gain further investments to enter new domestic and international markets.
Endua has received a grant of $998,269 to commercialise its hydrogen-powered energy storage solution designed to deliver sustainable, reliable and affordable power for the off-grid market.
Endua plans to manufacture clean power generation and storage in a modular power bank that can drive power loads of up to 150 kW in a single pack.
The company will use CSIRO electrolysis technology to produce hydrogen in its device which will store and deliver renewable energy, competing with traditional fossil fuel sources like diesel generators. Batteries serve as back up, but Endua’s goal is to deliver clean energy that can be stored in large quantities, enabling off-grid infrastructure and communities to have self-sustaining power sources.
Endua chief executive Paul Sernia, founder of EV charger maker Tritium, said the hydrogen-based technology will make it possible for regional communities, towns and industries like mines and remote infrastructure to become self-sustaining from the grid, using only renewables.

“Hydrogen electrolysis technology has been around for quite some time but it still has a long way to go to meet the expectations of commercial markets and be cost-effective when compared to existing energy sources,” he said. “The technology we’ve developed with CSIRO enables us to make the cost more affordable compared to fossil fuel sources, more reliable and easily maintained in remote communities.”
Sales of Endua’s power bank technology will initially focus on the off-grid diesel generator market, which accounts for $1.5 billion of diesel and 200,000 tonnes of carbon emissions per annum.
Queensland-based electric vehicle (EV) charging start-up Evos Energy has also been recognised in the latest Accelerating Commercialisation grants, awarded $837,472 to help commercialise its energy management and delivery platform for electric cars.
Evos, which launched its AC22 Home Fleet Charger late last year, said the technology simplifies the car charging process, works across all EVs, and reduces energy and operating costs for EV owners.
The charger targets businesses providing charging for fleet vehicles as it’s designed for employees to be able to easily install at their homes, increasing reliability and simplifying the charging experience. The charger also features Evos’ patented energy management software, which identifies ideal charging hours during non-peak periods and controls the charge rate, speed and power to reduce costs.

Evos said it will use the funding to commercialise and scale the platform, achieve global exports, create smart jobs, reduce the cost of EV charging and help businesses transition to carbon free transportation.
New South Wales company Biocarbon was also among the grant recipients, receiving $293,840 which will allow them to run a commercial trial of their technology which is designed to support green steel and help steelmakers to decrease their carbon footprint.
Biocarbon uses advanced manufacturing to produce renewable carbon and energy products for industrial applications. They have developed an innovative process to manufacture renewable carbon material to be used as a fossil carbon replacement in steelmaking.
The Entrepreneurs’ Program has provided 573 grants totalling more than $281 million to Australian businesses since it was established in 2014.
AusIndustry said the program aims to strengthen, grow, innovate and commercialise businesses by improving supply chain performance and improving capabilities to trade and export in global markets.
Businesses which are awarded an Accelerating Commercialisation grant must meet a comprehensive set of merit criteria, including how novel the project is, to be awarded up to $1 million in matched funding.
Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the grants will help home-grown companies grow, commercialise their products and gain further investments to enter new domestic and international markets.
“We are proud to support Australian companies take their innovative technologies and products to the next level through the commercialisation process,” he said.
“These latest projects are all great examples of Australian innovations – many across high-skilled manufacturing priorities – which have remarkable potential to improve the quality of our lives, create new jobs and support our economic recovery.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/21/pacific-energy-unveils-world-first-hybrid-power-solution-at-mine-site/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 21, 2022",Pacific Energy unveils ‘world first’ hybrid power solution at mine site,"Pacific Energy subsidiary KPS Power Generation said it had delivered a “world first” hybrid power station incorporating a 3.5 MW solar PV array and electric turbo compounding (ETC) technology fitted to the existing 10 MW diesel generator at Australian miner Iluka Resources’ $420 million Jacinth-Ambrosia mine site in South Australia’s remote north-west.
Pacific Energy chief executive Jamie Cullen said the combining of solar PV with ETC technology, which improves the efficiency of diesel generators by recovering waste energy from the exhaust, is like nothing seen before.
“This is an exciting development for both Pacific Energy and Iluka Resources in what we believe is a world first – integrating solar and ETC technology with an existing fossil-fuel facility,” he said.
Constructed by Juwi Renewable Energy, the Brisbane-based subsidiary of German company juwi, the renewable energy/diesel hybrid power solution incorporates solar PV generation with ETC technology and an upgraded control system.
The ETC technology allows the diesel generators to maintain the same power output while using less fuel and producing lower CO2 emissions, The technology has been fitted to each of the existing 10 1 MW generators.
Cullen said the conversion to a hybrid power solution would go a long way to reducing the mine’s electricity demand with the power plant expected to deliver almost 21% of the mine site’s annual electricity needs.

“The reduction in diesel consumption and improvement in fuel efficiency is expected to save over 2 million litres of diesel and over 5,500 tonnes of CO2 per year, every year, for at least the next seven years,” he said.
Iluka general manager for Australian operations Shane Tilka said the shift to a hybrid solution at the Jacinth-Ambrosia operation, which is capable of processing up to about 1,000 tonnes of ore per hour, is exactly what the company needed to do.
“The move from diesel to hybrid energy at Jacinth Ambrosia marks an important evolution in Iluka’s Australian operations. With the large solar resources available to us, the conversion is aligned with Iluka’s purpose to deliver sustainable value,” he said.
“The mineral sands and rare earths produced by Iluka are used in a range of sustainable development and renewable energy applications, including solar panels and wind turbines. It is exciting to see our first site powered by the same technology for which the products we mine and process are essential to manufacture.”
KPS, which has operated the 10 MW diesel facility at the Jacinth-Ambrosia mine site since it opened in 2009, will own and operate the hybrid project for an initial term of seven years.
The Jacinth-Ambrosia project is the sixth hybrid project carried out by juwi in Australia, with the company saying hybrid solutions have become a focus for its Australian arm.
Juwi is also responsible for Western Australia’s Sandfire DeGrussa Hybrid Project, which comprises 10.6 MW of PV, a 6 MW battery and a diesel generator, and has been operating since 2016.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/21/australian-trucking-association-pushing-for-shift-to-electric/,"EV,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 21, 2022",Australian Trucking Association pushing for shift to electric,"The Australian Trucking Association (ATA) claims a shift from diesel-powered trucks to electric ones would not only save Australian businesses money but would assist trucking businesses and supply chains by ending volatile diesel costs, reducing maintenance costs, improving urban efficiency, and delivering better conditions for truck drivers.
The report, a collaboration between the ATA and the Electric Vehicle Council (EVC), was produced with input from about 50 truck manufacturers, fleet operators, and charging infrastructure and electricity organisations.
It found electrifying Australia’s truck fleet, comprising approximately 500,000 rigid trucks and 100,000 articulated trucks, would see transport costs and the cost of goods for consumers and businesses tumble, with wholesale trade, construction, retail, and agricultural industries to reap most of the flow-on benefits.
The ATA said one of the top cost-saving opportunities was removing diesel from the equation, which accounts for 35% of long-haul operators’ costs and 20% of short-haul operators’ costs.
ATA chairman David Smith said it’s nearly seven times cheaper to fuel an electric truck than a diesel one, with the average cost for a 300-kilometre journey being $117 for a diesel truck, and just $18 for an electric truck.
Conversely, Smith warned that if Australia is “left behind” on the energy transition, freight costs would skyrocket for business.
“If Australia gets left behind on the transition to electric and zero emission trucks, we risk our supply chains and exporters getting stuck with high, globally uncompetitive per-kilometre freight costs,” he said.
“Trucking operators face a number of barriers to buy and use an electric truck and these must be addressed to lower freight costs, improve fuel security and reduce emissions.”

The report says maintenance costs would also decrease if Australia’s ageing fleet was electrified, highlighting that the average lifespan of a truck in Australia is 10-15 years, compared to France (9.3 years), Germany (9.5 years) and the Netherlands (9.6 years).
An ageing truck is typically inefficient, guzzling more fuel and needing more maintenance, in addition to the damage wreaked on the environment and public health.
Key recommendations from the new EVC/ATA report include exempting electric trucks from urban curfews, changing Australian weight and width limits to accommodate battery-powered trucks, exempting electric trucks from stamp duty, and providing financial incentives to reduce the cost burden of an electric truck and incentivising freight transition.
“The higher upfront cost of electric trucks is a significant barrier for trucking operators, who have low profit margins,” the report says.
“This issue was consistently raised by workshop participants and members of both the EVC and ATA. For some truck models, the upfront cost can be twice that of a diesel equivalent. With the high price of heavy vehicles, this can represent an additional $200,000.”
Other recommendations include investing in public charging infrastructure to support on-route electric truck charging and setting a sales target for zero-emission trucks of 30% by 2030 and 100% by 2040.
“Every government in Australia has committed to net-zero, but this can’t be achieved without decarbonising the transport sector,” EVC chief executive officer Behyad Jafari said.
“Curfew-free operations are a huge opportunity, creating benefits for operators optimising fleet operations and to the community through reducing peak hour traffic and congestion.
“We need the government to read these recommendations and get moving fast. If we implement them swiftly the benefits to Australian trucking, our economy, and our environment will be truly massive.”
The ATA is aiming to see 100% of new truck sales be electric by 2040 but said Australia currently lags most of the world in the electrification of trucks making the need for reform urgent. Of the 58 electric truck models available in North America, Europe, and China only 14 are available to the Australian market.
While the ATA has highlighted the economics associated with a shift to electric trucks, SEA Electric’s regional director for Oceania, Glen Walker, said the widespread uptake would deliver benefits beyond the obvious costs savings.
“Mass uptake of electric trucks in urban Australia has the potential to save millions of tonnes of CO2 each year and provide up to 40,000 MWh of mobile battery storage, which is a potential future revenue stream,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/21/lg-launches-new-australian-solar-module-range/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 21, 2022",LG launches new Australian solar module range,"South Korean solar module maker LG Electronics has unveiled a new range of solar panels for the Australian market, including the flagship 415 W LG NeON H+, as well as the LG NeON H+ White 410 W and the eye-catching LG NeON H+ Black 410 W models.
LG said the three new modules feature new wiring technology, gap-free design and its innovative half-cut cells, all of which combine to boost output and increase resistance to thermal stress and external impact.
The company estimates that through 25 years, a typical 10 kWp Neon H+ 410 W installation can generate an extra 32,632 kWh in comparison to an installation using the same 10 kWp conventional 370 W panels.
“The introduction of the NeON H+ range provides the type of high-efficiency and high-quality solution which is increasingly sought after by Australian homeowners,” LG Electronics Australia general manager Gus Pavian said.
“Backed by LG’s 25-year product and performance warranty, this module gives confidence about outstanding performance and durability, while reducing a home’s energy footprint.”
LG said with the average residential solar system likely to reach 15 kWp in the coming years, the latest modules have been designed to maximise roof space and cater for future needs.
LG said its N-type half-cut cells, which have a temperature coefficient of -0.33% per degree Celsius, are less adversely affected by hot temperatures than other solar panels on the market.
The company said performance is also enhanced by the gap-free design which reduces the distance energy needs to travel. The design of the NeON H+ range means cells overlap by 0.5mm, so more cells can fit in the same amount of space. This innovation can also help protect the wiring connecting the cells from external impact.
The NeON H+ modules come with a 25-year warranty for a performance level of 90.6% of initial performance at 25 years of continuous use.
As well as launching the new range, LG also announced updates to its LG NeON H BiFacial and commercial solar panel range.
The LG NeON H BiFacial will now include three new models: 440 W, 445 W and 450 W, which can absorb sunlight from both the front and rear sides of their cells by using a transparent back sheet. The company said this will provide up to 30% higher energy production when installed under optimal conditions.
New models for the commercial line-up include 460 W, 46 5W and 470 W models, which feature module efficiency of up to 21.4%.

A downward trend in polysilicon prices is anticipated this year, and inventory levels across the entire solar value chain are expected to begin building through the first half of 2022, said Corrine Lin, chief analyst at PV Infolink and Dora Zhao, senior analyst at PV Infolink, in a recent webinar held by Philip Shen, the managing director of ROTH Capital Partners. Click here to register and view the recorded webinar session. 
PV Infolink says that polysilicon ex-VAT (pre-tax) prices should improve from the current levels of $26-$30/kg to as low as $19/kg by the end of the year. Prices have recently ticked back up to about $30/kg, largely due to decreased polysilicon inventories driven by seasonality ahead of Chinese New Year and a rebound in utilisation levels from the end of 2021, said Zhao. 
Inventory levels are expected to build across the value chain, according to the report. Currently, value chain inventory levels are well below healthy levels, sitting at about a month to six weeks across all segments, said PV InfoLink. Polysilicon inventory is about two weeks, and wafers hold less than one week of inventory.
The report predicts an increase in production to 318 GW of polysilicon and 322 GW of wafers globally in 2022. It said that an inventory build of about 30 GW above forecast production for modules may result in pricing support for polysilicon and wafers through 2022. 
Capacity expansions are on the way across the value chain, driven by “just-in-case” inventory considerations due to ongoing Covid logistics. Lin and Zhao noted many new entrants are expected to continue through 2023, including Shangji Automation, Gaojing Solar, Shuangliang Group and Fuxing New Energy (n-type wafers.) 
Lowered polysilicon pricing will send a ripple effect through the supply chain, and PV InfoLink projected module prices will drop from $0.27/W in the first quarter to $0.24/W by the fourth quarter. 
N-type modules are expected to increase to about 7% to 8% market share this year, while PERC modules will likely retain their dominance with about 90% market share. Lin said there has been a rise in companies taking interest in TOPCon expansion over heterojunction. She said that perovskite technology likely needs five or more years to take a meaningful share of the market.

Chinese inverter manufacturer Sungrow has launched a new modular central inverter solution with an output of 1.1MW.
Called the 1+X modular inverter, the new product can be deployed, by combining eight units, to reach a power of 8.8MW. The inverter has a three-level modularisation at the inverter level, the system level and the component level.
“The system modularisation makes PV module configuration more flexible to extend,” Sungrow said in a statement. The inverter is said to supports a maximum two times DC/AC ratio. Moreover, the 1+X modular inverter has 42% more MPPT than traditional central inverters and it realises string-level management by means of a new wireless DC combiner.
The system also features a DC/ESS interface for the connection of energy storage systems.
“The component modularisation realises the plug and play function, reducing the maintenance from six hours to two hours,” the manufacturer further explained, noting that, since each inverter also works in an individual unit, it can be directly replaced by an on-site back-up inverter if a failure occurs.
