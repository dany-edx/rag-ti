Australia’s first community-owned renewable energy retailer, Enova launched its retail arm in 2016 and grew to service 13,200 customers across NSW and southeast Queensland, winning numerous awards along the way.
It will now be closing its doors, victim to the chaos in Australia’s energy market which saw the market operator, AEMO, take the drastic step of suspending the operation of the wholesale spot market in the National Electricity Market (NEM) last week.
“The market is broken and does not support small retailers,” Enova chief executive Felicity Stening said in a statement on Tuesday.
“The current diabolical state of the energy market, combined with the high wholesale market energy prices and the cap on customer pricing, has made it impossible for Enova Energy and many other small retailers to operate in the market.”
“In addition, the constant raft of state and federal government regulatory changes is adding to the market complexities and have caused Enova delays in being able to fund and resource energy innovation.
“We are very supportive of the Labor government’s fast action and current review of the energy markets. However, there needs to be greater emphasis on the plight of retailers.”
Enova focused on renewable energy and social equity, helping communities gain energy independence by sourcing electricity through customers solar panels. It reinvested half of its profits into community-owned renewable projects and services to improve energy literacy.
Greenpeace lamented the loss of Enova from the market, noting that the company tied for first place in its Australia Pacific 2022 Green Electricity Guide.
“News that Enova Energy has entered into voluntary administration is a damning indictment of the greed of the coal and gas power generators which are at the heart of the energy crisis that is hurting Australian households and businesses,” Greenpeace Australia Pacific senior campaigner, Glenn Walker, said.
“These anti-competitive and morally repugnant fossil fuel companies are reducing consumer choice and driving up prices, all in the pursuit of short-term profit. They are acting to hold Australia’s energy transition hostage, gaming the market and risking driving renewable energy-focused companies out of the market.
“Instead of forcing companies like Enova into administration, fossil fuel companies should be learning from them, responding to consumer demand and accelerating the energy transition.
“With AEMO’s intervention due to end, it will be a test whether the fossil fuel giants have learned their lesson and will put Australians before profit.
Cathro Partners has been appointed to manage the administration process for Enova, according to an ASIC notice issued Tuesday.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/21/two-australian-companies-left-vying-for-giant-4-5b-green-hydrogen-project-in-nz/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,PUMPED HYDRO,AUSTRALIA,NEW ZEALAND,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 21, 2022",Two Australian companies left vying for giant $4.5b green hydrogen project in NZ,"After 80 companies expressed in the project last year, the shortlist has been whittled down to two with billionaire Andrew ‘Twiggy’ Forrest’s Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) facing off against gas giant Woodside. The pair are now entering final negotiations to develop the reportedly AU$4.5 billion project.
Southern Green Hydrogen, which proposed the megaproject, is a joint venture between New Zealand power providers Meridian Energy and Contact Energy. It was set up in June last year to explore the opportunity of producing green hydrogen on New Zealand’s southernmost tip following the announcement Rio Tinto would close its Tiwai Point aluminium smelter, primarily powered by a Meridian hydroelectric plant.
The vision is to build a 600 MW facility which would use the power from Meridian’s Manapouri hydro scheme to energise hydrogen electrolysers, producing green hydrogen or green ammonia for export. According to Meridian Energy CEO Neal Barclay, the proposals received from both FFI and Woodside made it clear a Southland hydrogen facility would be both technically feasible and commercially sound, and both companies would be capable of delivering it.
FFI and Woodside have now been asked to provide more detailed proposals to Southern Green Hydrogen by the end of August, with the final selection of lead developer to be announced soon after.
Fortescue Future Industries (FFI)
It’s worth noting Rio Tinto has since wavered on its decision to close the Tiwai Point smelter, though New Zealand media have quoted Meridian’s Barclay as saying his company does not plan to continue Rio Tinto’s current energy contract, even if it wanted to keep its smelter operating. Likewise, spokespeople for Meridian have said the Southern Green Hydrogen project is not contingent on the smelter closing.
Hokonui representative and Ngāi Tahu lead for the green energy programme, Terry Nicholas, who has been closely involved with the project, believes the facility and its wider infrastructure could cost around NZ$5 billion (AU$4.5 billion). According to him, four potential sites for the facility have been identified.
Like Australia, New Zealand is keen to secure some of the green hydrogen market. Its government and private sector have committed around NZ$200 billion (AU$1.8 billion) to support the development of the burgeoning industry.
The allure of a project with an already secured and established renewable energy input is no doubt vast – especially for FFI which is hoping to live up to the hype its created around itself, targeting 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen production by 2030.
The allure also holds true for Woodside, which is facing sharp and renewed criticism over its Scarborough gas project, a sustained focus environmental group Greenpeace. Woodside is looking to stay relevant through its move into hydrogen, but is notably pursuing both blue (hydrogen made from fossil gas) as well as some green, renewable projects.
This earned it the ire of FFI last November, which mocked Woodside’s greenwashing of its H2Perth hydrogen and ammonia project on Twitter.

Melbourne’s outer suburbs are leading household solar boom. Since the rebate began back in 2018, five metropolitan suburbs have accessed more solar rebates than any others. Indeed, Tarneit, Cragieburn, Point Cook, Clyde North and Truganina make up a full 10% of all Solar Homes installations across the state. 
Rural access to the Solar Homes program was a point of criticism for Nationals’ Victoria Murray Plains MP Peter Walsh in 2020, who alleged Melbourne-centrism in the program when his electorate was overlooked by the program’s scheme for energy storage devices. 
However, northern Victoria is leading the uptake among rural areas of the state, notably the regional cities of Mildura, Shepparton, Wodonga, Wangaratta and Wallan. 
The Victorian government claims the program has already helped more than 200,000 Victorians install solar, saving households an average of $1,073 on their annual electrical bill. Moreover, a Solar Victoria customer survey revealed that 71% of respondents would not have installed solar if it hadn’t been for the program. 
“Our Solar Homes Program is driving down the cost of living for Victorian households and reducing emissions,” says minister for Solar Homes Lily D’Ambrosio. 
“Solar Homes customers are well-positioned to absorb energy bill rises in energy costs, by time-setting appliances to run during the day when solar systems are operating at their peak.”
The program is still open, and Victorian homeowners and rental providers are able to apply for rebates of $1,400 for the installation of solar panels, with an optional interest free $1,400 loan, and a further $1,000 rebate for the installation of solar hot water.  
“Household solar puts the power back into the hands of Victorian households,” continued D’Ambrosio, “while helping meet our target of halving emissions by 2030 and supporting 5,500 clean energy jobs.” 
Battery boom 
The last month has seen especially cold temperatures which, in combination with the energy crisis, has seen the demand for solar battery energy storage systems skyrocket. Solar Victoria chief executive, Stan Krpan, told The Guardian that inquiries into battery rebates in Victoria have spiked in the last two weeks.
Rates for residential battery energy storage systems are also available to households that have not previously claimed a Solar Homes rebate. The Andrews government expanded the scheme in March, and it now offers up to $3,500 for households to install a solar battery. 
Krpan reported that 5,842 battery rebate applications have been approved this financial year, more than double the number received last year with three weeks still to go. “In the past two weeks, phone inquiries to our contact centre have been 50% higher than the yearly average,” said Krpan. “We’re expecting this to lead to growth in installations over the winter months.”
The Victorian government-backed is also now supporting six different two-year VPP pilots as part of its Solar Homes program. The program is capped at 2000 rebates with the state government saying households that sign up to the pilot prior to June 30, 2022 and install a battery will receive a rebate of $4,174.
It has approved five battery brands to participate in the six distinct VPPs which it says will give participants “guaranteed financial benefits and additional consumer protections not widely available in the general market.”
The program’s five approved battery providers include Tesla, Mondo, Reposit, Sonnen and Arcstream.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/21/recycling-process-promises-better-than-new-silicon-wafers/,"RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JUNE 21, 2022",Recycling process promises ‘better than new’ silicon wafers,"From pv magazine Global
As the solar industry comes of age, dealing with the growing volume of products reaching end of life is already a research priority at universities and institutes the world over. Many different approaches are on trial, though experts are waiting until later this decade when the volume of products is expected to grow significantly, giving them room to experiment with processes at large scale.
Processing and purifying silicon from end-of-life cells back to a state where it can again be inserted back into the PV supply chain to make new cells has proven a major challenge here. It requires high levels of energy and a complex understanding of tiny impurities left in the recycled silicon that differ from brand new material.
Some already say that diverting this silicon to applications with lower purity requirements is the best solution. However, a group of scientists led by the Key Laboratory of Urban Pollutant Conversion at the Chinese Academy of Sciences may have come up with an alternative – one that cuts out the energy-intensive ingot production stage entirely.
“Skipping the process of Si ingot production and wafer cutting can save approximately 40% of the cost of PV module production,” the group explained in its research. “Nonetheless, there is still a major challenge for the current technologies: regenerated solar cells from recovered Si wafers tend to exhibit a decreased conversion efficiency, which is not acceptable for the current competitive PV market.”
Recovery and upgrade
With this in mind, the group sought ways to recover silicon wafers suitable for production of high efficiency cells and modules. They demonstrated a series of chemical treatments that are shown to both purify wafers and improve their surface characteristics, making them suitable for use in new, high-efficiency cells. The process is described in full in “A systematically integrated recycling and upgrading technology for waste crystalline silicon photovoltaic module,” which was recently published in Resources, Conservation and Recycling.
The group took advantage of a process previously used by wafer manufacturers to reduce surface reflectivity and produce “black silicon” wafers.
“Through this technology, desirable and highly pure Si wafers with intact structure, minimally reduced thickness and excellent light-trapping ability are successfully obtained,” the group explained. “The properties of the reclaimed Si wafers are characterised and evaluated for new solar cell manufacturing and packaging, which encourages regenerated solar cells with higher power conversion efficiency than that of new commercial solar cells.”
