The Suntop Solar Farm, near Wellington in central northern NSW, and the Gunnedah Solar Farm, west of Tamworth in the state’s north-west, were acquired by Canadian Solar in 2018 as part of a deal with Netherlands-based renewables developer Photon Energy.
Canadian Solar said both solar farms, which have a combined capacity of 345 MW(dc), have reached substantial completion and are expected to generate more than 700,000 MWh a year, avoiding more than 450,000 tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions annually.
The Gunnedah Solar Farm was among Australia’s top performing utility scale solar assets in June with data from Rystad Energy indicating it was the best performing solar farm in NSW.
Canadian Solar said both the Gunnedah and Suntop projects are underwritten by long-term offtake agreements with Amazon, one of the largest multinational technology companies in the world. The United States-headquartered multinational signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) in 2020 to buy a combined 165 MW of output from the two facilities.
In addition to the sale of the projects, Canadian Solar said it has entered into a multi-year development services agreement with CalEnergy, owned by US investment titan Warren Buffet, that provides a framework for the companies to work together to build out Canadian Solar’s growing renewable energy pipeline in Australia.
“We are delighted to work with CalEnergy in Australia to grow their renewable energy portfolio,” Canadian Solar chairman and chief executive officer Shawn Qu said in a statement. “The sale of these projects in NSW paves the way for a strong collaboration between our respective companies.
“In Australia, we have now brought seven development projects to NTP (notice-to-proceed) and beyond and continue to develop and grow our multi-GW solar and storage pipeline. I look forward to continuing to contribute to Australia’s decarbonization and renewable energy growth ambitions.”
Canadian Solar has a pipeline of projects totalling approximately 1.2 GWp and Qu said he intends to grow the company’s solar projects and solar module supply businesses in Australia, while expanding into other C&I sectors in the region.
“We see a bright future ahead as Australia continues to expand its renewable energy market,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/08/on-the-fringe-outer-edges-of-nem-most-prone-to-volatile-mlfs/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JULY 8, 2022",On the fringe: Outer edges of NEM most prone to volatile MLFs,"While long, the National Electricity Market (NEM) is also sparse. It’s a relatively unique trait that has brought with it a unique set of issues. One of these issues is electrical losses, and the not-so-simple task of accounting for them.
In our GenInsights21 report released last December, I contributed Appendix 4: A twenty-year history of MLFs which featured a graphical representation of long-term marginal loss factor (MLF) trends around different areas of the NEM.  Up until then, we’d seen an increasing amount of coverage on the discrete year-on-year MLF changes which was particularly framed around ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ that risked readers not seeing the forest for the trees.
In this article, I will provide some context about MLFs and why they are important, before diving into a couple of more notable MLF trends to give examples of what’s driving long-term location signals in our market.
In any electrical system, some amount of energy is always lost during the transportation of electricity from the source of generation to the point of consumption. The AEMO estimates that electrical losses equate to roughly 10% of all electricity generated in the NEM.
There are two distinctive features of electrical losses:
Electrical losses are always changing – this is because they are a function of the load, network and generation mix, which themselves are constantly changing.
In an electricity market, these electrical losses need to be accounted for and incorporated into the pricing mechanism in order to ensure that there is a disincentive for developers to build new generation in locations that will increase losses in the system.
In the NEM, we currently use MLFs as that mechanism. Consistent with the marginal-cost market design of the NEM, a marginal loss is the incremental change in total losses for an additional unit of electricity generated.
An MLF represents the marginal losses between the given connection point and the Regional Reference Node (RRN). Each region has a designated RRN which is usually near its demand centre (e.g. Victoria’s RRN is in suburban Melbourne) and by definition, the RRN has an MLF of 1.0. While the RRN is typically at/near large loads, the choice of which connection point is the RRN itself is completely arbitrary – the calculation eventually makes this mathematically redundant – as Ben Skinner has noted.
MLFs are forward-looking. The AEMO takes several inputs (projected generation, demand and dispatch patterns, etc.) and runs a load flow model for every half-hour in the financial year ahead in order to obtain a volume-weighted average of the projected marginal losses. Each connection point, be it generation or load, is given an MLF – but note that for the purposes of this article, I have only examined MLFs as they relate to generation connection points. The AEMO publishes MLF figures for all connection points about two-to-three months prior to the start of a new financial year. The MLF then applies for one year and remains static until they are recalculated for the next financial year. The AEMO reserves the right to perform intra-year revisions where they identify a modification that would result in a material change in capacity of an existing connection point.
Typically when commentators or media outlets talk about regional ‘spot prices’ they are referring to prices at each RRN. But the reality is that an MLF is applied to a generator’s bid in dispatch when the NEM Dispatch Engine (NEMDE) calculates their ‘effective’ bid at each 5-minute interval. In settlement, the MLF is multiplied by the price at the RRN to get the effective settlement price for the generator and is an important figure in revenue calculations.
In dispatch, a generator with an MLF of 0.8 bids at $80/MWh. This effectively gets treated as a $100/MWh bid ($80 ÷ 0.8 = $100) at the RRN. If the price is set at $90/MWh for that interval, this generator will not have been dispatched even though they bid below the eventual RRN price.
In settlement, this process happens in reverse. In the above example, if the RRN price was instead set at $100/MWh, the generator with the MLF of 0.8 will only receive $80/MWh ($100 × 0.8 = $80) if they were dispatched. You could think of this as a calculation to determine the value of the electricity that was delivered to the RRN.
If you are longing for a document that will help put you to sleep at night, you can read the full methodology for how the AEMO calculates these figures.
Marginal Loss Factors are a key part of the price signal that the NEM is designed to provide. They are supposed to represent the locational element of this price signal and should help inform developers, investors, and/or other stakeholders where to build and invest new generation.
A higher MLF should generally be a signal for more generation near that connection point.
Wrong.
MLFs are about the volume-weighted marginal losses that will occur to and from the location of a connection point.
To visualise an example of this, let’s look at Oakey Solar Farm and the Oakey Power Station. These are two generators that lie on the Warrego Highway near the Queensland town of Toowoomba. They are separated by a small field almost 2km wide – a tiny distance in a network that covers thousands of kilometers.
Source: Satellite image taken from Google Maps
Both generators are almost at the same location on the network but the MLFs are almost three points apart.
In this case it’s not the location, but the time-of-day operational characteristics that separates the solar farm (which generates during daylight hours) and the gas power station (a ‘peaker’ which mainly generates in response to early evening demand peaks).
We can therefore deduce that the marginal losses on the energy generated at this part of the network are projected to be lower during the day compared to the early evening over the next financial year.
While a 2.7% difference in absolute terms may seem minuscule – having a few percent shaved off your top-line revenue can eventually have rather large repercussions on the profitability and the investment viability of your plant. It’s also important to keep in mind that Large-Scale Generation Certificates (LGCs) are awarded/created based on the electricity delivered to the RRN, hence factor in MLFs. This can make it a double-hit for renewable plants.
While it may seem axiomatic that electricity generation should be built close to areas with high electricity demand, this often proves difficult after factoring in things such as
These factors often mean that project developers look further afield to find suitable sites for new generation projects.
However, making sub-optimal decisions about site location can lead to significant consequences on the plant’s ability to deliver electricity to the grid and generate revenue (and in turn, affect investor confidence) as the investment is committed once the project has been built.
A pronounced example that is often cited is the solar and then wind farm that was built around Broken Hill from 2015 onwards. This small town is in one of the most remote parts of the NEM, but now contains around 300MW of registered generating capacity. Much of the generation in this area has been increasingly affected by constraints – not always able to deliver its full potential output to the rest of the network – while also being subject to significant losses when it can dispatch.
I’ve made the animation below to demonstrate the sequence of events that led to this outcome.
In the early days of the NEM, MLF volatility was far less of an issue as the market never received such sudden influxes of new generation away from the traditional demand centers as it has in more recent years.
The flood of new generation to relatively weak parts of the grid, in what some might call a seemingly un-coordinated manner, led to a number of falling MLFs and other congestion issues from circa 2017. These issues have continued to have adverse outcomes for both the incumbents and the new entrants in these areas.
Far North Queensland is the northernmost point of the NEM.
The image below shows the long-term trend of the MLFs for the three utility-scale generators in the area.
Source: Chart first appeared in Appendix 4 of GenInsights21. Transmission map specifications are taken from AEMO Map.
The Barron Gorge and Kareeya hydro power stations were the only generators registered here when the market commenced, and they remained so for almost 20 years. In late 2018, the 180MW Mount Emerald Wind Farm connected to this part of the network. Around the same time, several solar farms began connecting close to Townsville and further south near the Whitsundays. The result of which was a degradation of the MLFs for the incumbent generators in these areas – Barron Gorge and Kareeya being just two examples. Paul noted this impending crunch was coming back in late 2018.
More generation is due to connect with Neoen’s 157MW Kaban Wind Farm currently under construction. It will sit roughly halfway between Mount Emerald and Kareeya and is expected to be fully operational in 2023. That project also includes approval for a 100MW battery and an upgrade from 132 to 275 kV for the transmission line between Cairns and Townsville which may help alleviate the impact of losses when new generation connects.
The animation that I embedded above covered the history of the generation that was built around Broken Hill. Since the large drop for the 2018/19 FY, the MLFs for these three generators have failed to retrace the lost ground.
Further south near Balranald, the Limondale and Sunraysia solar farms have also experienced poor loss factors since they were both connected to the NEM. The MLFs for each generator has been announced at 0.831 for the 2022/23 FY.
In a similar fashion, the Coleambally and Darlington Point solar farms which sit further east also saw significant downgrades to their loss factors post-2018. These two MLFs have been set at 0.877 and 0.888 respectively for the 2022/23 FY.
The discussion about MLFs is related to the broader discussion about congestion.
In the case of the Broken Hill Solar Farm, it was the oversupply of energy generation near the other end of the 220kV transmission line that resulted in significant congestion. The change in marginal losses was higher because losses are proportional to the square of the power flow– when power flows are higher, losses are guaranteed to increase (all other things being equal).
Constraints are another aspect of congestion. In many cases, you will find that the generators who have been hurt by falling MLFs in recent years, have also been increasingly hurt by the effect of network constraints at the same time.
Allan O’Neil’s wonderful explainer and case study on constraints in the NEM gives the perfect introduction to this important aspect of the market. Our new Constraint Dashboard has also helped a number of generators navigate these in real-time, as Paul demonstrated for a price spike on the 6th of June 2022.
Given that I’ve demonstrated how new generation can increase marginal losses in the surrounding area, it is worth exploring what effect the removal of generation has had. This is relevant given that the market’s remaining coal fleet is scheduled to be decommissioned over the coming decades.
As shown in GenInsights21, the closure of Hazelwood in 2017 had virtually no impact on the MLFs around the La Trobe Valley as the strong transmission infrastructure and proximity to Melbourne meant the marginal losses for those remaining generators barely changed. Instead, it was the generation on the other side of the border in Southern NSW that saw increased MLFs due to the reduction in imports from VIC.
Similarly in the 2016/17 FY in SA, the projected loss of generation from Northern Power Station and Torrens Island Unit A did not affect the MLFs of nearby generation. The impact was instead felt in the far southeast of the state where the MLFs of the generators around Mt Gambier fell around 8 to 12% as a result of increased imports via the Heywood interconnector.
The image below shows a summary of all committed and potential transmission projects and has been taken from the AEMO’s 2022 ISP that was released last week.
Image: AEMO
The $40m transmission upgrade near Cairns (Northern QREZ Stage 1) that I alluded to earlier is the only upgrade that is fully ‘committed & anticipated’ in the northern half of Queensland at this stage.
The $2.28b EnergyConnect project is now officially under construction as well. The project includes a 330kV transmission line that will span 900km and will allow for direct interconnection between SA and NSW for the first time. It may go some way in easing the congestion pains felt by those generators that lie in South-West NSW and North-West VIC (within the so-called ‘Rhombus of Regret’).
Perhaps a craftier approach to avoid an MLF headache is to change the market rules to remove them.
Alternative mechanisms have been proposed and discussed, including a move to Average Loss Factors (ALFs) which was rejected by the AEMC in November 2019. Nodal Pricing (where a local connection point price is adjusted dynamically in real-time) is another mechanism that has been implemented in other markets around the world and has been debated at length on our own shores. Tom Geiser has explained a number of these alternative mechanisms and their merits in his article “Let’s Talk Losses”. Derek Chapman has also written about the “War of Losses”.
With any of the proposed mechanisms (and the existing MLF structure) there will always exist a trade-off between:
In any case, a change in the market rules does not magically banish the underlying losses – they will still occur and need to be priced within any market design.
I could argue that past missteps, while costly, have been somewhat instructive to developers planning site locations for future generation projects. The increased awareness of this risk will have led to market participants being more cognisant of the inherent complexity of participating in the NEM.
A small number of industry consultants have developed their own models to help developers predict future MLFs using a similar methodology that the AEMO uses. Like any modelling or forecasting, these have their limitations – as future generation, demand, transmission upgrades, or even market design are far too hard to predict the further into the future you attempt to do so.
The NEM is full of intricate and nuanced concepts, and marginal losses are just one of these. I will finish by listing a few of my bigger picture takeaways about MLFs and their role in price signaling in our market:
This article builds upon what was presented in Appendix 4 of GenInsights21. The appendix included 48 charts of long-term MLF trends (like the chart shown for Far North Queensland) representing smaller chunks of geographic areas of the NEM.

The $2.5 billion Supernode project will be developed in stages on a 30-hectare site in the northern Brisbane suburb of Brendale. The site is adjacent to the South Pine substation, the central node of Queensland’s electricity grid where more than 80% of all power capacity located in the state transmits to. The site will also have direct connections to an international subsea data communications network.
Quinbrook co-founder and managing partner David Scaysbrook said the site provides an “unrivalled” location for power supply resilience, offering up to 800 MW of capacity with three separate high-voltage connections.
“It also offers ample scope for powering our large-scale batteries with locally produced solar, wind and hydro sourced renewables which will also power the data centre campus as it grows,” he said.
Quinbrook plans to procure, self-develop and construct the renewables supply capacity needed by Supernode customers as their energy demands grow. It is anticipated Quinbrook will source wind power from third-party projects under development and will build new solar farms itself.

The Supernode project is likely to be built in four stages, with Quinbrook targeting financial close on the first phase by the end of June 2023. Progress on the battery storage infrastructure is more advanced with Quinbrook having already lodged applications to enable construction to commence in mid-2023.
Quinbrook said the battery energy storage system would provide benefits beyond the Supernode precinct, offering critical back-up for the Queensland power system.
The BESS will add valuable dispatchable supply services to the grid to firm additional renewables capacity and put downward pressure on power prices while also reducing the risk of power outages for all Queenslanders, the company said.
Quinbrook has already obtained both Foreign Investment Review Board and local planning permissions from Moreton Bay Regional Council for the 800 MW capacity campus will host third-party data centre operations. It has has already commenced the marketing of the precinct to prospective data centre operators, with CBRE appointed to manage engagement.
The Supernode BESS adds to several milestone large-scale battery projects Quinbrook is currently constructing and developing in the United States and United Kingdom, including the $2 billion Gemini solar and storage project, which recently closed the largest ever financing for a single US renewables project.
“Brendale follows close on the heels of our recent investment in Texas creating a similar 800 MW green data centre campus at Temple, near Austin, the initial phase of which became operational last month,” Scaysbrook said.
The Brendale battery is the most recent in a flurry of  energy storage projects announced in Queensland.
Government-owned energy generator Stanwell last week announced plans to a build a massive 1.45 GW/2.9 GWh battery storage system near its coal-fired power station in Central Queensland while fellow state-owned utility CS Energy has outlined plans to build a 200 MW/400 MWh battery at Greenbank in Brisbane’s outer southern suburbs. Those batteries are among 13 large-scale battery systems outlined by the Queensland government in its most recent state budget.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/08/iea-warns-one-third-of-global-pv-manufacturing-capacity-at-risk-of-bankruptcy/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 8, 2022",IEA warns one-third of global PV manufacturing capacity at risk of bankruptcy,"The International Energy Agency (IEA) has revealed that more than 30% of the integrated companies operating in the solar module manufacturing business worldwide are at medium or high risk of bankruptcy.
In the Special Report on Solar PV Global Supply Chains, the agency stressed that only 15% of these manufacturers are at high risk of bankruptcy and that in 2018 that share was about 28%. As for polysilicon suppliers, about 11% of them are currently at a high risk of bankruptcy, while another 49% are estimated to have a medium risk.
“Owing to high polysilicon prices, the bankruptcy risk of polysilicon businesses dropped considerably in 2021,” the report says. “A return to low polysilicon prices could, however, reverse this change.”
According to IEA analysts, the support that the Chinese government is awarding to polysilicon manufacturers in the form of financing and subsidies makes this market segment particularly vulnerable from a financial point of view.
“For instance, the largest polysilicon company posted net losses between 2018 and 2020 despite government support,” they state without naming the producer.
“From a security-of-supply perspective, consistently poor financial performance within and across the solar PV value chain reinforces supply chain vulnerability to bankruptcies and underinvestment, which can reduce its resiliency, raise prices and limit PV deployment.”
The agency warned about possible changes in subsidy regulations for the PV industry in China, claiming these may lead to higher bankruptcy risks, even for the most competitive manufacturers.

“Should competitive companies go bankrupt, this could lead to broader price increases and supply impacts, in addition to loss of the subsidy,” the IEA says.
The report examines solar PV supply chains from raw materials all the way to the finished product, covering areas such as energy consumption, emissions, employment, production costs, investment, trade and financial performance.
The paper describes thoroughly the main vulnerabilities of the global PV supply chain while highlighting the need for a wide geographical diversification of the industry.
“China has been instrumental in bringing down costs worldwide for solar PV, with multiple benefits for clean energy transitions,” the IEA analysts emphasize.
“At the same time, the level of geographical concentration in global supply chains also creates potential challenges that governments need to address.”
Global manufacturing capacity for solar panels has increasingly moved out of Europe, Japan and the United States over the past decade and into China, which has taken the lead on investment and innovation.
Image: IEA
China’s share in all the key manufacturing stages of solar panels exceeds 80% today, according to the report, and for key elements including polysilicon and wafers, this is set to rise to more than 95% in the coming years, based on current manufacturing capacity under construction. According to IEA estimates, the world will almost completely rely on China for solar panel production through 2025.
“China has been instrumental in bringing down costs worldwide for solar PV, with multiple benefits for clean energy transitions,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a statement. “At the same time, the level of geographical concentration in global supply chains also poses potential challenges that governments need to address.
“Accelerating clean energy transitions around the world will put further strain on these supply chains to meet growing demand, but this also offers opportunities for other countries and regions to help diversify production and make it more resilient.”
Wafer manufacturing is the most concentrated supply chain segment, with China accounting for 97% of global capacity in 2021. An estimated 85% of cell production is located in China while module-manufacturing capacity is more distributed globally but it is still relatively concentrated with China home to 75% of the world’s module-making capacity.
“This level of concentration in any global supply chain would represent a considerable vulnerability; solar PV is no exception,” the report states.
The report encourages governments to move solar panel supply chain diversification up the policy agenda as an integral part of advancing clean energy transitions, and to facilitate needed investments through measures such as finance and tax policies.
Countries “need to ensure that their transition towards a sustainable energy system is built on secure foundations,” Birol said.

The 75 MW Wyalong Solar Farm, which will sell about half of its output to publicly owned telecommunications company NBN Co under a 10-year power purchase agreement, is being developed on a 260-hectare site about 10 kilometres northeast of West Wyalong.
Approximately 127,000 solar panels will be installed on the site, with an estimated 150 jobs to be created in the construction phase. Generation is expected to begin in late 2022 with the output enough to power the equivalent of 27,000 Australian homes.
More than half of the output has already been allocated with NBN Co committed to purchasing 51% of the power generated by the asset, which it says will help it achieve its goal to switch to 100% renewable energy by the end of 2025.
Federal Communications Minister Michelle Rowland, who attended a sod-turning ceremony at the site on Thursday, said the project would supply the NBN with about 80 GWh per annum, enough to supply the broadband network with close to 20% of its energy needs.
“This initiative will not only support NBN Co with their climate transition, it will also support Australia’s transition to net zero and create up to 150 jobs in the Griffith and West Wyalong community and stimulate the local economy,” the minister said.
“It is critical Australian organisations and communities find ways to reduce emissions, and NBN Co through its 100% renewables commitment is not only reducing emissions, it is also the first Australian telecommunications company and Australian government business enterprise to join the global RE100 initiative.”

The start of construction at the Wyalong project comes in the same week that Western Australian company Pilecom announced it had completed works at Mytilineos’ 100 MW Moura Solar Farm in Central Queensland, just five months after construction began.
The Moura solar farm comprises an estimated 185,000 solar modules mounted on a single axis tracking system, spread across approximately 203 hectares.
The project is on track for energisation later this year with network operator Powerlink confirming the construction of the required connection infrastructure, including a new feeder bay at the Moura Substation and associated connection work, has already been completed.
Once operational, the project is expected to generate enough renewable electricity to power more than 43,000 homes. But even before it comes online, more than half of the output has been allocated through a long-term PPA with Queensland government-owned generator CS Energy.
The project is one of a suite of solar farms acquired by Mytilineos from Esco Pacific in late 2020.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/08/water-based-zinc-ion-battery-for-stationary-energy-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 8, 2022",Water-based zinc-ion battery for stationary energy storage,"From pv magazine USA
Lithium-ion batteries dominate the market for electric vehicles and home energy storage due to lower cost, higher performance, and lower weight compared some alternatives, but the main challenges are safety and sourcing of materials. The safety risk of lithium ion is thermal instability, a condition that can lead to a thermal runaway.
Over the past several years lithium-ion batteries have been known to explode in laptops, cell phones, and to cause fires in large energy-storage facilities. Sourcing of the battery materials, which include lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite, is also a challenge as the materials often come from conflict-prone areas like the Congo. These challenges have led some manufacturers to seek alternatives. pv magazine USA spoke with Ryan Brown, CEO and co-founder of Salient Energy, a manufacturer of zinc-ion batteries, and he explained that Salient’s mission is to develop a battery that mimics the performance of lithium-ion while using abundant materials that come from conflict-free areas, and that do not pose a safety risk.

Brown acknowledged that lithium-ion is the best at energy for the weight and that manufacturers have done well to reduce cost, but safety remains an issue. He said, for example, recent fires in Tesla vehicles are caused by thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries. “When used in home energy systems, safety is also a top priority,” Brown said.
Zinc-ion batteries are a non-flammable option, due to their water-based chemistry, Brown noted. He said that the zinc-ion energy storage systems have the same power, performance, and footprint as lithium-ion systems, “so they are a true alternative to lithium-ion.”
One advantage to zinc-based batteries is that they can be manufactured on the same lines as lithium-ion, which keeps manufacturing costs low. As far as safety goes, “safety is the killer advantage,” said Brown. “What we’ve done is we’ve made a zinc battery that works the same way lithium ion works. We have zinc reacting on both sides, so we don’t have to store the reactant in electrolyte.”
Target market
The main application market that Salient is targeting is stationary energy storage. “Residential yes, but ultimately we want to be in the shipping containers.” With the main advantage being safety, Brown sees the zinc-ion battery as a viable alternative for batteries that need to be placed indoors, such as in apartment buildings. “A city is not place to put energy storage outdoors, and with California mandating that apartments must have energy storage, zinc-ion is a safe solution.”
To demonstrate the safety of zinc-ion batteries as a residential energy storage solution, Salient Energy is partnering with Horton World Solutions (HWS) a sustainable homebuilder that is installing the batteries in 200K homes that it is constructing in the Dallas Fort Worth area as well as across the Sunbelt. Construction on these homes will be underway by Q4 of 2022.

Salient’s batteries are made up of a zinc, a pH-neutral zinc sulphate electrolyte, and a manganese oxide-based cathode, all of which are abundant are mined and processed in North America, allowing Salient to source materials from a domestic supply chain. While Salient is based in Nova Scotia, in early 2022 the company opened an office in Oakland, Calif. A team of 7 engineers based in Oakland are currently focused on developing and improving Salient’s residential battery systems, the same system used in the HWS demonstration.
For now, Salient is manufacturing batteries at its Dartmouth, Nova Scotia facility at a small scale of around 100 batteries per month, but the company is in the process of ramping up production at this facility to the pilot scale (1000s of batteries per month) to support pilot projects in the residential space.

Typically, when solar panels are evaluated, traditional metrics like efficiency, cost, levelised cost of electricity, and reliability are used as major benchmarks. As the global economy shifts to adoption of renewable energy, carbon emissions reduction must be kept under focus as a central goal of sustainable development.
Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) are keeping that focus, and recently published new work in Joule that takes solar module assessment to the next level. The studies homed in on “embodied” energy and carbon, which is the sunk energy and carbon emissions involved in manufacturing a PV module. The team also evaluated energy payback periods, or the amount of time that it takes a solar array to generate the same amount of energy that was used to produce it.
“Green technologies are awesome, but as we are working to scale them up to an incredible magnitude, it makes sense to take a close look to see what can be done to minimise the impact,” said Samantha Reese, a senior engineer and analyst in NREL’s Strategic Energy Analysis Center.
In the report, the team evaluated two major types of solar cells: crystalline silicon and cadmium telluride (CdTe). “We combined life-cycle analysis with materials science to explain the emission results for each technology and to examine the effects of future advances. We want to use these results to identify areas where additional research is needed,” said Reese.
The report found that applying a cost to carbon could result in a US$0.02/W to US$0.04/W advantage in CdTe versus traditional silicon cells.
By looking at present-day carbon efficiency on the grid in countries that manufacture solar, the researchers found that a cleaner grid in specific regions can lead to half as much emissions as other regions that use more dirty technologies like coal to power the grid. And, though silicon-based solar cells currently dominate the market, emerging thin-film PV technologies like CdTe and perovskites provide another path to cutting carbon intensity in half again.
“If we want to hit the decarbonisation goals set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as much as a sixth of the remaining carbon budget could be used to manufacture PV modules,” said NREL researcher Matthew Reese. “It’s a massive amount of manufacturing that has to be done in order to replace the energy sources being used today.”
Recently, Maxeon Solar Technologies announced the milestone of exceeding the energy payback period 100 times over the 40-year life cycle of its Maxeon 3 series of solar panels and an energy payback period as little as 47.5 days.
“One of the big strengths of PV is that it has this positive feedback loop,” said Nancy Haegel, centre director of NREL’s Materials Science Center. “As we clean up the grid—in part by adding more PV to the grid—PV manufacturing will become cleaner, in turn making PV an even better product.”
