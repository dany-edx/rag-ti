With its regal undertones, it seemed like an odd fit for the solar-dominated renewable industries in Australia. The pair have had trouble communicating precisely what their start-up concept is, after finding the term “renewable energy broker” left most looking puzzled. Recontextualising familiar words into new industries, it seems, is no easy feat.
The more I ruminated on it though, the more the term concierge made sense – essentially Teho is looking to take the (renewable) reins, consulting with customers to find out about their needs and then delivering them a handful of retail options from the increasingly lucrative world of green energy.
“I think the industry is in a weird position where it’s super popular and people have heaps of information on it from their friends and family, but the growth of solar hasn’t been followed with information,” Jonathan Green tells pv magazine Australia. “It’s become mainstream but no one really knows what they’re doing.”
Having spent years working in the solar sector, Jonathan found most everyday Australians are eager to embrace renewables but remain put off by the industry’s novelty. “From a customer perspective, while working in solar for so long, I always ask customers why haven’t they done this before and they always go ‘it was too confusing, I didn’t know what I was doing, and I always put it in the ‘too hard’ basket.’”
The insight compelled him to join forces with his brother, David Green, to found Teho in 2020. Leaning into both his namesake and his experience of having ridden an automotive finance startup from the ground floor to its arrival at the top, David’s background made him a logical fit.
“If you go to the core reason of why we started it all in the first place, we saw an opportunity in the market to start an organisation that really led the education process when it comes to renewable energy,” David Green tells pv magazine Australia.
“We were looking at the industry as a whole and no one did everything.”
Basically, Teho is situating itself as a middleman – sitting between customers who wants to invest in renewable energy – be it installing solar panels, a battery, purchasing an EV or just finding a clean retailer – and the retailers who provide those products.
At the heart of Teho’s service is its internal Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform, which the brothers have lovingly developed over the past year and named Doug. The platform essentially stores all the product and plan information, allowing Teho to give its customers a range of company comparisons on the spot.
The offering, according to the Green brothers, benefits customer and retailer alike. For customers, the process is simplified – perhaps they want solar panels today but are cognisant of the fact their family car will probably soon be replaced with an EV. Teho finds systems that would be big enough to cater to EV charging needs, streamlining integration.
On the other end of the deal are retailers. The brothers say their helpful service to product-providers is bringing in customers, alleviating marketing battles.
Of course, all advice comes at a cost. With Teho, the Green brothers have chosen to make retailers rather than customers foot the bill.
Since Teho negotiates directly with retailers, bargaining a lower price with the promise of more customers, the brother’s are adamant the cost for the end customer remains the same. “It’s build into the price, so there’s no fixed fee per se,” Jonathan says.
How the startup is going about finding retailers to work with has come, in large part, from speaking to manufacturers directly and seeing who their best retailers are. “A lot of it comes through word of mouth,” David says. The brothers are taking what they describe as a “qualitative approach,” partnering with retailers who they believe share similar values (following an in-house audit).
So far, Teho has around 20 solar retail partners, hundreds of EV and hybrid dealerships (thanks to David’s history in cars) and a handful of EV charger partners. “We’ve got enough, but we certainly want more,” Jonathan says.
Based in Sydney themselves, many of Teho’s partners are from New South Wales. Retailers from other states are now the company’s focus as it sets about expanding to other states.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/25/solar-tax-proposal-met-with-immediate-outcry-but-aemc-insists-doing-nothing-is-not-an-option/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 25, 2021","Solar export tax proposal stirs immediate outcry, but AEMC insists ‘doing nothing is not an option’","The Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) has once again thrown its idea for a solar tax in the ring, insisting Australia’s grids will be destabilised by the midday flood from solar-exporting homes and that shifting grid infrastructure to accomodate a two-way power flow costs money. The idea was immediately met with outcry from community and industry groups.
“We need to be encouraging more rooftop solar – not penalising people for putting panels on their roof,” National Director of the community group Solar Citizens, Ellen Roberts, said in a statement released shortly after the news broke this morning.
The AEMC, however, say the rule draft addresses the problem of grid “traffic jams,” which it posits as the primary problem standing in the way of a cleaner energy mix. “Blocking power exports because the grid is under strain will cost us all more, because it means less renewable, cheaper energy gets into the system,” the AEMC statement released with the full 260-page determination said.
The rules changes seek to encourage battery uptake, which the AEMC says will prove crucial for time-shifting solar energy resources. “We can decarbonise the electricity sector faster and cheaper if we connect more small solar customers and make it worthwhile for them to install batteries. But to do that we need to make some changes to the power system,” AEMC’s Chief Executive Benn Barr said.
1. Solar tax (or as the AEMC frame it, “letting networks offer two-way pricing to better manage the poles and wires”)
The AEMC say this reform will give networks pricing options to reward solar and battery owners for exporting to the grid when it is actually needed, rather than when the sun is shining. The converse side of this is that it would also give networks the option to charge customers for sending their electricity at midday.
“New incentives will give customers more reason to buy batteries or consume the power they generate at busy times on the grid,” the AEMC says. With the cost of home battery still substantial in Australia, it seems questionable the tax would be enough to  compel widespread adoption.
2. “Changing distribution networks’ existing incentives to provide services that help people send power back into the grid”
The AEMC says there are currently no financial penalties for poor network export service and no rewards for good service – which is something it wants to change. “We also propose recognising energy export as a service to the power system in the energy rules to give consumers more influence over what export services networks deliver and how efficiently they deliver them.”
3. Giving networks “flexible pricing solutions”
Networks should be encouraged to design what the AEMC are calling “a menu of price options” to suit capability, customer preferences and government policies. “Customers could choose things like free export up to a limit or paid premium services that guarantee export during busy times. Networks might offer grandfathering for existing solar owners or choose community batteries,” the AEMC said.

Already defending against the inevitable backlash, the AEMC insists the proposal “does not mandate default charges for exporting power.”
“This is about creating tailored options, not blanket solutions,” Mr Barr said. If network companies do opt for export charging, the AEMC say they would need to “consult extensively with customers” and have transition plans approved by the Australian Energy Regulator. 
Pushing a “fairness” angle, the AEMC say the reforms mean no Australian will be left behind. “We want to avoid a first-come, best dressed system because that limits the capacity for more solar into the grid,” Barr added.
“One option to deal with more solar traffic – building more poles and wires – is very expensive and ends up on all our energy bills whether we have solar or not. While the sun may be free, the poles and wires aren’t, so we think the key is to use the power system smarter to avoid costly over-investment and keep new infrastructure to a minimum.
“Letting networks give customer incentives to use the system better means supply and demand on the grid can be smoothed out over the course of the day.”
In the hours after the draft determination was released, industry peak body, the Clean Energy Council, released a statement calling for consumer protection to be better considered in the proposed reform.
“It appears as though the all-important job of consumer protection has been passed to the states,” Clean Energy Council Chief Executive, Kane Thornton, said.
“We need to know whether state and territory energy ministers will allow networks to charge customers whenever they export electricity to the grid and, if so, what customer protections will be put in place.”
The Council pointed out “more questions than answers have been raised” by the draft determination. Whether such a scheme would be mandatory; whether export charges would be applied to all customers; whether zero export limits would continue to be imposed; and finally whether ombudsmen would be appointed to intervene on solar customers’ complaints are all issues that remain unclear.
The Clean Energy Council also questioned whether distribution networks would be required to fix poor voltage management before or after the reforms come into effect.
Community Group Solar Citizens also released a statement scolding the proposal. “The Queensland and Victorian Governments have already publicly stated their opposition to the sun tax, but now we urgently need all of our State Energy Ministers to step up and protect solar owners from this discriminatory charge,” National Director Ellen Roberts said.
Even Australian household solar battery company, RedEarth Energy Storage, which presumably stands to gain from the push towards domestic batteries, have slammed the proposal, saying a solar tax would only rip off Australian families to fatten the pockets of big energy companies.
“The notion that big energy companies will do the right thing by their customers is fanciful,” the company’s Chief Executive Charlie Walker said.
“The big energy companies simply don’t like that mums and dads can sell excess power back into the grid. Thousands of Australian families have done the right thing by the environment and invested in solar and now they risk being charged for it.
“This sets a dangerous precedent after governments have been encouraging households to turn to solar for decades.”
AEMC boss Benn Barr said the Commission had already heard concern from solar owners, presumably leading them to model the impacts of the reforms.
“The Commission modelled the potential impact on customer bills if networks did introduce export charges. We found that 80% of customers would see their bills drop because they would no longer pay for solar export services they weren’t using. 
“For the 20% of customers with solar, there could be a range of export charge impacts, depending on system size. A 4−6 kW system would still earn on average $900 – about $70 less than now. But this impact could look very different if they took up options that rewarded them for using the system differently – such as self-consuming power.
“Doing nothing is not an option because blocking people’s power exports will cost them now and more in future. While export charges on a 4−6 kW system might lead to a marginal drop in solar earnings, owners will face that same drop if they are constrained from exporting energy just 10% of the time. Being constrained 50% of the time would reduce their solar earnings by more than $300 per year.”
AEMC says the rule change reforms are the result of nine months of consultations with stakeholders as part of ARENA’s Distributed Energy Integration Program.
The AEMC are now asking for feedback on the draft determination, with submissions due by 13 May 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/25/five-large-scale-community-batteries-to-be-integrated-into-the-sunshine-absorbent-states-substations/,"COVID-19,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 25, 2021",Five large-scale community batteries to be integrated into the sunshine-absorbent state’s substations,"The Queensland government today announced plans to install five large-scale, network-connected batteries in regions across the state as part of a community battery trial. With a combined capacity of 40 MWh, the batteries will be installed at substations in Townsville, Yeppoon, Bundaberg, Hervey Bay and Toowoomba.
With its eye-watering rooftop solar penetration (almost one in three Queenslanders living in detached houses now have solar on their roofs), the trial seems to be setting the stage for the government’s ambition of firming its grid by housing large-scale batteries in major substations – a concept which has recently been embraced by a number of Australia’s state governments.
“Energy Queensland-owned sites have been identified for this trial where deployment can occur as quickly and efficiently as possible, and where we are seeing the highest penetration of solar on the network,” Queensland’s Energy Minister, Mick de Brenni, said in Thursday’s statement.
“If successful, Energy Queensland could deploy distribution batteries in locations right across the state.”
“In the medium term, this technology means we can ‘bank’ the excess renewable energy generated allowing a continued growth in rooftop solar on the way to achieving Queensland’s renewable energy target.
Currently, 20% of Queensland’s energy mix comes from renewables. The government are aiming to bring that up to 50% by 2030 – and is clearly hopeful that capturing low-cost renewable energy during the day and distributing into the market in peak evening periods will accelerate its energy sector’s decarbonisation.
New South Wales’ government in February launched a similar trial, announcing plans for three community batteries in areas with high rooftop solar penetration. Melbourne’s Yarra Council in January made a similar move but focussed its attention on city dwellers, while Western Australia’s community battery rollouts continue to power.
With Australia’s rooftop solar growth expected to exceed last year’s 3 GW record, according to the Clean Energy Regulator, governments are scrambling to make the most of the abundant daytime power and avoid the solar shutdowns which have afflicted South Australia.
State-owned Energy Queensland already has one network-connected battery, a 4 MW / 8 MWh Tesla battery at Bohle Plains in Townsville. This new slate of batteries will include another in Townsville, to be housed at the Black River Substation.
The Yeppoon battery will be located at the Tanby Substation, while Bundaberg’s will be integrated into the Bargara Substation. Hervey Bay and Toowoomba’s batteries will be part of the Torquay Substation and Torrington Substation respectively.
“Because Queensland has one of the highest levels of rooftop solar uptake in the world, we want to make sure we’re using this important source of renewable energy in the right way and our network is keeping up with demand,” Queensland’s Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said in the statement.
With renewables central to its Covid-19 recovery plan, the Queensland government also pointed out that its interest in community batteries doesn’t start and end with decarbonisation.
“This storage will deliver benefits across both the transmission and distribution networks and will also offer increased opportunities for local manufacturing and civil works for local businesses,” Minister de Brenni said.
“For example, some of the components, such as the switchgear, could be made locally and there will be opportunities for Queensland-based training and development.”
“An affordable, reliable energy supply underpins our economic plan for post-Covid recovery, and renewables will play a central role in that.”
Expected timelines for installation and partnering companies have yet to be announced.
The plan has been warmly welcomed by Queensland’s Solar Citizens group. “Adding more battery storage to the network is a smart move by the Queensland Government because it means we can soak up extra renewable energy, particularly solar, when it’s abundant and then utilise that energy when we need it,” Solar Citizens’ National Director Ellen Roberts said.
“Battery storage can react to grid disturbances with lightning speed and provide valuable network services as we see the uptake of renewables grow and grow.”
The community battery news comes hot off the heals of the Australian Energy Market Commission’s draft determination recommending networks be allowed to charge rooftop solar owners for exporting clean electricity to the grid.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/25/energy-renaissance-targets-defence-grade-cybersecure-bms/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 25, 2021",Energy Renaissance targets ‘defence grade’ cybersecure BMS,"Australian battery manufacturer Energy Renaissance (ER) has unveiled a $1.46 million battery management storage (BMS) development project which will see it design and manufacture a defence-grade cybersecure BMS in collaboration with Australia’s national science agency, the CSIRO.
The project also has the support of the not-for-profit, independent Innovative Manufacturing Co-operative Research Centre (IMCRC) which is matching ER’s financial commitment dollar for dollar.
Brian Craighead, ER’s director of technology and development, said the Australian-made and manufactured BMS will be coupled with the company’s superStorage series of renewable-energy-storing lithium-ion batteries which are to be manufactured at its $28 million facility in Tamago in the New South Wales Hunter Valley.
“We have spent a lot of time and money designing the superStorage platform to allow us to do all the things we promised, to make things safer, cheaper, faster, better for the Australian and South-East Asian markets,” Craighead told pv magazine.
“The end result is a plug-and-play battery system that works for us and the battery management system is at the heart of it.”
The BMS will monitor and report on the battery’s usage, lifespan and faults through a mobile network to ER and its customers.  Communicating through an inverter, the system will enable secure real-time data, analytics and remote management to drive down the risk of battery failure and operating costs for grid-scale energy storage users.
ER is also determined the BMS will provide customers with certainty regarding the sovereignty and security of the software and hardware.
“The collaboration between Energy Renaissance, CSIRO and IMCRC will promote an Australian Battery Management System instead of relying on an overseas technology platform,” Craighead said.
“Working together with CSIRO will ensure we can create a world-class, defence-grade cybersecure Battery Management System that is fully developed and managed in Australia for critical energy storage infrastructures.”

Craighead said providing assurances about the sovereignty and cyber security of the BMS is crucial to the energy storage industry moving forward.
“We can’t expect defence, we can’t expect government, we can’t expect large companies to trust the adoption of clean energy systems if we don’t trust the software completely,” he said.
“As you plug batteries into mission-critical systems – building management systems, energy management systems – we believe it is very important that the software that runs those batteries are protected from nefarious actors or even incompetent actors.
“It’s not now considered very high risk because it’s early days but if history has taught us anything, it will go from being a small issue to mission critical in the space of one event.”
Craighead pointed to the SolarWinds incident which has rocked disparate industries across the United States in recent months as a prime example of the need to have secure BMS software in place.
In that incident, nation-state hackers, now presumed to be Russian interests, gained access to government and commercial networks via an IT monitoring platform update rolled out by U.S. software firm SolarWinds. The hack is known to have breached, among others, the departments of Energy, Defense, State, Homeland Security, Treasury, Commerce, and its National Nuclear Security Administration.
“When it comes to software, when it comes to integrity of the system powered by software. I always go back to first principles, you need to know where things come from,” Craighead said.
“If you’re not sure of the sovereignty of it and completely sure of where it came from, who wrote it and for what purpose, then you are opening yourself to risk. And the risks are very real.”
Dr Adam Best, CSIRO principal research scientist Dr Adam Best has been seconded to ER to help develop the BMS and said the “exciting” project is progressing well.
“We’ve already started looking at the architecture of the cyber security aspects and are trying to map out the threat matrix,” he told pv magazine.
“In terms of the actual hardware and software, we have chosen our cell chemistries. We have some cells which have been shipped in and we have already started testing those.”
Best said the BMS will serve as the ‘nerve centre’ for the battery and will make them safer, more affordable and optimised to operate in high-temperature environments.

David Chuter, CEO and Managing Director at IMCRC, said the research collaboration between ER and CSIRO could serve as a catalyst for further establishing an Australian battery manufacturing sector.
“The growing interest in renewable energy and thus demand for lithium-ion batteries provides a great opportunity for Australia,” he said.
“Through accessing local knowledge and expertise, this project will demonstrate how we can utilise Industry 4.0 technologies and principles to establish a viable Australian battery manufacturing sector for the benefit of all Australians, and as a national manufacturing priority.
“The commitment from all involved in this project will help position and strengthen the value and influence of Australia’s role as a strategic partner in the global lithium-ion battery value chain.”
While ER offered no definite date for the release of the BMS it did confirm it would be part of the first superStorage batteries which are due for commercial release by July.
“When we release the superStorage range of batteries, it will have our own BMS in it,” Craighead said. “You’re talking about somewhere about June, July.”
Meanwhile, Craighead said work is progressing well on its 4,500 sqm purpose-built manufacturing facility with completion expected in late September. When the Tamgo facility is operational it is expected it will have an initial battery production capacity of 66 MWh per annum, with plans to scale the operation up to 5.3 GWh.
Until then, ER is planning to lease a facility which will allow it to produce batteries on a smaller scale to meet existing demand.
The Australian-made batteries will power stationary (grid and microgrid, renewables, community storage, mining electrification) and transport (buses, light commercial and industrial vehicles) applications.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/25/australias-first-locally-assembled-electric-truck-fleet-launched-by-melbourne-company/,"EV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 25, 2021",Australia’s first locally assembled electric truck fleet launched by Melbourne company,"Melbourne is now home to the production line of SEA Electric’s first electrified truck fleet which is now available for purchase from 15 dealerships across Australia. The company on Wednesday announced the launch of its two fully electrified models, the SEA 300 and SEA 500, based on the Hino 500 Series and Hino 300 Series models, with each offering a range of motor, battery, chassis and axle configurations.
The Australian company, founded in 2013, had previously specialised in retrofitting diesel trucks, but has now entered the market of new truck production, assembling its trucks from Semi Knocked Down (SKD) kits.
At the top of the range is the SEA 500-225, boasting a 280kWh battery. All of the models are propelled by SEA’s patented Drive Power-System, which the company says is available in various performance and range packages from 4.5 tonne car licence vehicles through to 22.5 tonne 3 axle trucks.
SEA says its “real world testing” of in-service vehicles travelling up to 1000 kilometres per week showed charging costs of less than $14 per day using standard off-peak electricity prices of 15c per kWh, which can be further reduced by the use of solar.
SEA Electric
SEA Electric’s Regional Director for Oceania, Glen Walker, described the company as “privileged” to be able to bring the Australian-first to the marketplace.
“These trucks truly meet a need in the marketplace, and prior to this launch, we have received pre-orders for 46 vehicles from some of Australia’s biggest companies and councils,” Walker said.
In addition to zero carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane emissions, the company also point out that the trucks host a number of other benefits, including no smelly fumes, quiet operation, and reduced vibration improving driver fatigue.
“In Australia, carbon dioxide emissions from transport are now the second highest behind electricity generation, and are forecast to continue rising,” Walker said. “With this announcement, the freight industry can now react–safe in the knowledge that their freight product offering will be enhanced in their clients’ eyes.”
“Mass uptake of electric trucks in urban Australia has the potential to save millions of tonnes of CO2 each year, and provide up to 40,000 MWh of mobile battery storage, which is a potential future revenue stream.”
Being sold at 15 accredited SEA Electric dealerships nationwide, the trucks come with a three-year warranty covering parts and services, with roadside assistance available from NTI for the life of the warranty period. For more details about the models and range of configurations available, see SEA Electric’s website.
