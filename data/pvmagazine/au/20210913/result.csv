Energy Estate and partner Renewable Energy Systems (RES) are kickstarting their planned 2 GW Central Queensland Power (CQP) development 30 kilometres inland of Rockhampton with a hybrid renewable energy hub known as the Moah Creek Renewable Energy Project — first step, community drop-in information sessions starting next week.
“This is what we do,” Simon Currie, Principal at Energy Estate tells pv magazine Australia: ambitious hybrid projects that engage with all stakeholders, in the heart of industrial regions with good grid connections.
Energy Estate has more than seven renewable energy projects currently in train, including Walcha Link, a privately funded transmission project that will take the majority of the 4.5 GW of energy produced by its planned Walcha Energy Project (on which it’s partnered with Mirus Wind)  to the vicinity of the Hunter Valley’s soon-to-retire Liddell Power station, where it will be used to produce green hydrogen, or flow through existing distribution lines to pump up industry in the region with low-cost renewable energy.
Moah Creek will follow a similar plan, with the final combination of generation and storage perhaps still to be adjusted in response to consultations with customers such as Rio Tinto’s Boyne aluminium smelters, which employs more than 900 people on Boyne Island south of Gladstone, or a number of green hydrogen projects in the region.

“Have you seen what’s happening with aluminium prices at the moment?” asks Currie. “They’re off the charts, and the question is how to green it while it’s at those highs, so that people keep their jobs.”
He says, of Moah Creek and the ultimate CQP project, “If we look back in the ten years and we have not brought new industry into Gladstone, and kept the smelter, we’ve failed.”
Energy Estate and RES have what they believe is a no-fail shared vision for the Central Queensland region, Matt Rebbeck, CEO of RES, said in the first edition of the Moah Creek emailed Newsletter last week.
“The CQP project … is perfectly positioned to create jobs, deliver low-cost clean energy and support the competitiveness of the region’s existing heavy industry to lead in the capture of domestic and export opportunities in the transforming energy sector.”
RES itself has delivered more than 21 GW of renewable energy projects around the world and with offices in Queensland, will take the lead at the community information sessions in Kalapa next week, given the majority of Currie’s team is still in lockdown in Sydney. 
Currie says he’s “a little in love with Gladstone”, because he responds to industrial towns, and the surrounding region is also a drawcard as a major employer, a productivity powerhouse … and a renewable energy opportunity.
“You look at Biloela, which is a cattle and coal town. Rockhampton is an agricultural centre, Bundy [Bundaberg] which is traditionally agriculture as well, and then Gladstone. There are phenomenal opportunities,” he says, echoing the beliefs pursued by not-for-profit Beyond Zero Emissions, in its Repowering Manufacturing campaign, which focuses on the Hunter and Gladstone regions; and with which Currie is also affiliated.
He says people in Gladstone and Rockhampton have expressed their support of the Moah Creek project. In discussions with the community and potential offtakers so far, RES and Energy Estate have reminded them that Central Queensland has seen it all — including coal and gas extraction — and renewable energy “is not an ideology, it’s just an evolution” of the energy offering.
Currie points out that the region has the ports and natural resources to take advantage of the energy transition. Where it sits, within the triangle formed by Gladstone, Stanwell and Callide power stations, it also has a workforce that understands energy production.
“I like to build projects close to existing power stations, he says, “like we’re doing in the Hunter Valley, because you’ve got the people there who understand power, rather than going out to places in country Australia where no-one has ever run a power station.” He emphasises that hybrid renewable energy projects like Moah Creek are the new power stations.
The timeline for the Moah Creek Renewable Energy Project has preliminary ecological surveys under its belt, an indicative site layout, and community engagement is beginning. By late 2022 to early 2023, the partnership hopes to have received a connection to grid offer from Powerlink; and in 2023/24 it anticipates reaching financial close so that construction can commence.
Its message to the surrounding community, expressed in Newsletter 01, is that a project of this size will have an impact, not only on regional opportunities, but on the local landscape for decades to come. “Given that, we are committed to working hard to deliver honest, early, respectful, considered and comprehensive engagement with the host community and all of the other stakeholders.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/13/large-scale-renewable-investment-may-be-trending-up-rooftop-pv-surges-on/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PUMPED HYDRO,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2021",Large-scale renewable investment may be trending up; rooftop PV surges on!,"The Clean Energy Regulator (CER) last week released its Carbon Market Report for the June Quarter and rooftop solar customers can once again be proud of their contribution to emissions-reduction — with 803 MW of PV installed — an 18% increase over the same quarter last year; while large scale solar and wind are showing an upturn in financial investment decisions (FID) in the second quarter of 2021 (725 MW) compared to the dismal first quarter (19 MW).
Given this quarter’s performance, the CER says “Australia’s carbon markets are on track to meet expectations estimated in the December 2020 Quarterly Carbon Market Report,” which forecast a total carbon emissions reduction of 57 million tonnes for 2021.

Large-scale solar and wind have been the renewable sectors of most concern in the industry, with investors both keen but cautious, given the uncertainties caused by delayed grid connections, transmission infrastructure shortfalls, and fossil-fuel-favouring policies issued by the Australian Federal Government.
In this Quarterly Carbon Market Report, the CER says that based on the 744 MW of large-scale solar and wind projects reaching FID this year so far, plus 1.6 GW expected to reach FID in the second half of the year, plus the potential for some of 2022’s 1.6 GW expected to reach FID achieving that landmark a little ahead of schedule … it expects the total capacity achieving financial investment decision this year to equal last year’s 2.7 GW, and perhaps even exceed 3 GW.
The CER cautions that investment trends can only be accurately identified by considering multiple years rather than single quarters, but that based on current information, investment in large-scale renewables “seems to have settled at an average of approximately 2.5 GW per annum reaching FID and may be trending up”.

In its report, the CER uncharacteristically editorialises, “This is quite an extraordinary effort by the renewables industry in the context of increasing difficulty, time and cost in grid connections” and the belief by some industry pundits that investment could fall to zero once it was clear that enough capacity would be built to meet the 2020 Renewable Energy Target.
It says that with a joint probable pipeline of 7.1 GW in committed projects, the outlook for the renewable energy industry over the coming few years is positive.
However, it adds, that, “At some point, investment in renewables may stall if delivery of transmission and interconnector upgrades are not sped up.”
The weekend saw a disturbing reported blowout in costs of new transmission in the National Electricity Market NEM, with HumeLink (the 500 kV connector from Snowy 2.0 massive pumped-hydro storage and renewable generation project to Wagga Wagga, Bannaby and Maragle) up from $1.35 billion to $3.317 billion; the VNI-West link from Ballarat to Wagga Wagga up from $2.4 billion to $4 billion.
Craig Stallan, an executive manager at transmission network operator TransGrid, which is building HumeLink, told the Sydney Morning Herald that the project is “a fundamental enabler” for new renewable energy supply to be added to the grid.
Simon Corbell, Chief Adviser at Energy Estate and CEO of the Clean Energy Investor Group agreed, saying, it is “critically important that we expedite transmission projects such as HumeLink” as part of Australia’s climate change action.
Transmission remains a contentious piece of the energy-transition puzzle, with its long timelines to approval and construction, and the constant reassessment in the light of potentially more flexible and lower-cost alternatives such as virtual transmission consisting of large-scale battery storage “relays”.
Bruce Mountain, director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, told the Herald on the weekend, for example, that many other transmission ventures are vying for funds as renewable energy projects seek to connect to the NEM, and that greater transparency was needed around how choices for investment are made, and the impacts on household energy tariffs.
The costs of HumeLink will ultimately be borne by customers of AusGrid and Mountain calculates the projected blowout will increase New South Wales residential electricity bills by 4%, raising annual average charges of about $1500 by $60.
If approved, the project would lift New South Wales household tariffs by about 4 per cent, raising average annual bills of $1500 by $60, he said.
In the meantime, the CER shows New South Wales leading the rooftop solar installation board, with 258 MW of capacity added in the June quarter, more than 50 MW ahead of Queensland at 207 MW, and 100 MW ahead of Victoria which nonetheless laid on 157 MW.

Although the CER says it’s too early to know the impact that Covid-induced lockdowns, most drawn out in Victoria and New South Wales this year, will have on final figures for rooftop solar in 2021, it says more rooftop solar is typically installed in the second half of any year, and there is still opportunity for the numbers to surge.
Based on installed rooftop capacity in the first half of 2021, “and assuming this seasonal pattern had held, the total capacity for the year could have exceeded 3.6 GW”, says the Quarterly Carbon Market Report, but the impacts of lockdowns are likely to dampen installations such that the country can merely expect to repeat last year’s stellar 3 GW of installed capacity, perhaps a smidge more.
The 18% growth in rooftop PV over the same period last year has been driven both by increasing numbers of installations (97,100 this year compared to 84,700 in last year’s June quarter) and an increase in average system size, from 7.5 kW to 8.3 kW.

Overall, in schemes administered by the CER, the Small Scale Renewable Energy Scheme — rooftop solar — is expected to this year deliver 15.5 million tonnes of the total forecast 57 million tonnes in emissions reduction; large-scale renewable energy projects are on track to contribute 24.3 million tonnes, which is 2.9 million tonnes in excess of the Renewable Energy Target-legislated demand for the year.
In addition to carbon emissions displaced by clean, renewable generation, projects under the Emissions Reduction Fund portfolio, which include gas captured from waste and carbon sequestration by revegetation, have increased 5% over the same period in 2020, and are on track to contribute 17 million tonnes of emissions abatement.
The Clean Energy Regulator says it is now close to founding an exchange for Australian carbon credits, with a call for expressions of interest for the Australian Carbon Exchange (ACX) having generated 27 responses by the deadline of 20 June 2021.
An exchange will reduce transaction costs and normalise the trading of carbon credits for individuals and companies.
Australian Carbon Credit Units have risen in price by 40% this year and are expected to continue to rise to 2030 as new emissions reductions targets declared by companies begin to generate action and carbon accounting improves.
On that topic, the Clean Energy Regulator is co-designing the Corporate Emissions Reduction Transparency (CERT) report initiative and pilot, and it says, “Consultation on the refined guidelines will occur later in 2021.”
Company emissions reduction targets are an important driver of large-scale renewable energy projects in that having corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs) in place is seen as a strong indicator of success for proposed large-scale solar projects.
The CER report says, “Prospects for renewables in 2022 and beyond are bright with the pipeline of projects that have a power purchase agreement and development approval growing [in the June quarter] by 60 MW to 511 MW.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/13/let-south-australias-world-leading-flexible-solar-exports-trial-begin/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2021",Let South Australia’s world-leading flexible solar exports trial begin!,"September 23 will see the start of SA Power Networks’ (SAPN) 12-month Flexible Exports Trial, which has the potential to double the amount of rooftop PV participating in the South Australian electricity network using smart technology to manage the flow of solar exports in response to congestion signals.
From Thursday next week, new and upgrading solar customers in parts of the grid that can’t handle anymore solar feed-in at certain times of the day, for short periods of the year, will no longer be limited to a year-round 5 kW of solar exports — a measure which was taken to protect grid stability, but which has proved a blunt instrument that unfairly impacts new solar customers compared to those who got in early and have been unrestricted in their exports.
“We are in the early stages of this new technology, and Flexible Exports is a world first that will help us accommodate more solar on our network,” said Mark Vincent,  SAPN’s General Manager of Strategy and Transformation.
Flexible Exports will initially allow new systems connecting in the most solar-loaded of Adelaide’s southern suburbs a great leap in export capacity, if they are prepared to install a compatible smart inverter — from either Fronius SnapINverter Primo series and GroWatt MIN-TLX series — paired with the energy-management technology of Australian company SwitchDin’s Droplet gateway.
“Based on network conditions experienced over the past 12 months, the flexible option would allow customers the opportunity to export 10kW for 98% of the time,” said Vincent.
To put it another way, intelligent flexible connection technology will allow new solar-equipped customers in the operating radius of the Sheidow Park substation, where more than 46% of households already have solar on top, to export more energy by reducing exports only when the network is actually constrained.
The Flexible Exports Trial project “will quantify the extra value this can create for solar customers in constrained areas compared to zero-near-zero export limits, informing the business case for DNSPs to invest in this capability,” said the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), when the project was announced in July.
ARENA is supporting the $4.84 million project with $2.08 million in funding; its aims being to verify a system that can give customers “greater choice, the ability to export more from their solar panels, access to cheaper energy, and improved security and quality of supply — all without costly network upgrades,” said the agency.
Participation is not mandatory. Those in the shadow of Sheidow Park substation who would prefer to use other inverter brands will still be connected, but with a 1.5 kW export limit, because on a few occasions each year — typically on mild-sunny days in spring, when solar is pumping around the middle of the day, and the demand of air conditioners has not yet cut in — the system can no longer cope with anymore exports at even 5 kW. 
Existing customers and those upgrading in other parts of the network that aren’t congested are not affected by the Flexible Exports Trial, and will continue to be able to export up to 5 kW.
As the trial begins, Fronius and SMA inverter providers in Australia are simultaneously working towards providing inverters with built-in capability to manage flexible exports, such that they won’t require the mediation of the Droplet tech; and the range of Droplet-compatible inverter systems will also be expanded over time.
The specially enabled inverters will automatically adjust their export limits every five minutes in response to locational, dynamic limit signals issued by SAPN, the distribution network service provider (DNSP).
“We expect that once we have proven the technology and assessed the customer experience that this will become a standard offer for new solar customers in South Australia from mid-2022,” Vincent said, adding, “It is part of our plan to double the amount of solar that we can accommodate on our network by 2025.” 
SAPN was instrumental in proposing what has become a controversial rule change by the Australian Electricity Market Operator, which, in brief, will allow networks to apply to upgrade the distribution network — whether with innovative fixes such as the dynamic exports being trialed in this project, or with physical upgrades to the system — to support greater solar integration, and charge solar customers a tariff for those upgrades.
In an interview with pv magazine Australia, in June, Bryn Williams, Network Strategy Manager at SAPN, said the rule change would support changes to the ability of the network to host more distributed renewable energy. “In the future,” he said, “we can consider pricing arrangements that pass on the component of our costs associated with enabling more energy to be fed in, to the people who are using that, separate to charging for simply maintaining the network etc which will continue to be recovered through the normal charges on energy consumed from the grid.
Energy Networks Australia, the industry body representing gas and electricity distribution and electricity transmission networks, welcomed the commencement of the 12-month trial.
ENA Chief Executive Andrew Dillon said he believes “The SA trial will have implications not only for the rest of Australia, but internationally.”

Austrian mounting system provider Aerocompact has unveiled a new mounting system based on a 5.8m long support rail that does not lie on the roof but is connected directly to a purlin placed below with self-drilling support screws. In this way, the manufacturer said, the panels are neither stressed nor damaged, as all compressive and tensile forces from wind or snow are directed into the roof substructure.
The roof substructure is screwed with thin sheet metal screws directly onto the top layer of the panels. Spacer sleeves and additional supports guarantee that the distance between the rail and the roof is maintained evenly and that good ventilation is ensured. A pre-assembled rubber seal prevents moisture from entering the raised beads. A patented structural algorithm regulates the optimal distribution of the support points on the roof, in the Aerocompact planning software.
“As a rule, photovoltaic systems are mounted directly on the roof skin with self-tapping screws, so that compressive and tensile forces act on the panels and damage them,” explains Marco Rusch, group head of corporate communications at Aerocompact. “With our concept, damages are almost impossible.”
The company specified there is no need for any approvals or additional certificates from the manufacturer for the installation, which makes retrofitting photovoltaic systems significantly easier. The mounting system may also be installed on a rooftop system with different types of solar modules. “Because the roof substructure absorbs all the forces, it is irrelevant which panels were installed and which forces they can withstand,” explains Rusch.
Aerocompact has integrated a fastening solution which is suitable for wood, steel and aluminium purlins, into the in-house planning tool Aerotool, and project planners will find automated features for optimal load distribution. The mounting system comes with a 25-year guarantee.
