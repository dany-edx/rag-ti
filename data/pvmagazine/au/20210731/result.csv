Polarisation and internecine party politics are the default settings of the Australian climate discourse – at least at the national policymaking level. At the same time, the country has the most installed PV per head of population and the highest uptake of residential rooftop PV, reminds the University of New South Wales’ (UNSW) Anna Bruce.
The apparent contradiction may confound observers, but it makes Australia’s energy transformation particularly dynamic. It is also ideal for research, particularly as levels of renewable penetration continue to climb. And it’s a field that requires an interdisciplinary approach, which is precisely the one Bruce takes.
“While I work for SPREE, I do most of my research with the Collaboration on Energy and Environmental markets, an interdisciplinary research collaboration with colleagues from the business school, and social scientists along with engineers,” says Bruce.
The approach allows for a more holistic analysis of the country’s energy transition, a transition that is seeing consumers and solar “prosumers” play an increasingly important role. “There is increased recognition of the importance of consumers and consequently a lot of change is occurring,” says Bruce. “Even networks businesses are needing to be more consultative with consumers.”
UNSW
While solar installation and increasing renewables share are nationwide developments, the state of South Australia has proven to be an unintentional case study. The state, an interconnected region of Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM), has seen renewable penetration soar, as a wave of large-scale wind and rooftop solar have displaced ageing coal and gas generators.
The development has left the grid light on synchronous generation, and at the very forefront of discussions as to how high levels of renewables can be integrated into the grid, while maintaining system strength and avoiding prohibitively high costs.
“In South Australia, there are days when the whole of the region’s demand is supplied by solar, mostly on rooftops, for hours in the middle of the day,” explains Bruce. “Because of this we are seeing challenges in the distribution network, but also at the system level. In aggregate, rooftop solar is larger than the largest generators on the NEM.”
The result of this development saw urgent, and some argue hurried, changes to PV inverter standards, and new rules introduced by the South Australian government in 2020. This allowed the market operator to control inverters remotely in times of grid disturbance and to require technical changes in how inverters operate during such events. The changes also allowed for the increasing curtailment of inverters at high voltages, which will impact consumers by limiting both grid exports and self consumption, and the resultant revenues.
“I think that for those changes we need to be cautious, because they are not immediately urgent,” says Bruce. “There could have been more time taken, and a better cost-benefit analysis, and a better understanding of how those changes are going to impact consumers that own PV systems.”
Solar households in Australia are facing charges incurred on their PV grid exports, another move proposed by regulators – this time on a national level. Bruce says it is not clear whether such charges are necessary, nor whether they will have the desired impact, such as encouraging households to add batteries, thereby controlling exports, and contributing to network voltage.
“I don’t think we should want to discourage people from installing PV,” says Bruce. “I do recognise the equity concerns and there is a need for networks to spend money to enable this transition, I’m just not convinced that’s the way to do it.”
What is clear is that connected batteries will play a central role in the integration of increasing levels of renewable energy into electricity networks in the pursuit of 100% renewables – a goal whose possibility the UNSW researcher says is undoubtable. There is still much to learn about what is the most effective way to deploy energy storage, and what households will be willing to accept, by way of “orchestration” or remote control of these distributed fleets of batteries. These include virtual power plants (VPP), demand response, EVs, and other forms of energy storage.
“There is not that much analysis out there of these small, distributed batteries in the field, and what they are actually doing. At SPREE, PhD student Hou Sheng recently analysed a data set of more than 600 batteries. In this case they were doing what we call ‘load following,’ which means absorbing any excess PV from the household, until the battery is full, and then using the battery to meet the load when there is insufficient PV.”
In this “load following” mode, the UNSW research found that the batteries were effective in terms of reducing peak loads, even when not orchestrated into a VPP. “Where they don’t provide much benefit is in actually reducing the peak export, which is now the big emerging challenge we are seeing in Australia,” adds Bruce. “But Hou Sheng showed some simple ways you can improve that, just by delaying the time at which you charge the battery or reduce the rate at which it charges.”
What is clear is that a 50%, 75% or even a 100% renewable energy network will not resemble the centralised, fossil-fuel powered legacy grid, and that consumers are going to have be engaged and brought along on the journey. “It’s complicated,” says Bruce, making the case, in short, for her interdisciplinary approach.

So is it a plan of action or a plan to plan some action down the line? 
What the QLD government say
Premier Palaszczuk and Environment Minister Scanlon say the Plan affirms and invigorates QLD’s already stated policies of reaching 50% renewable energy by 2030, reducing 20% of its emissions below 2005 levels by 2030 and reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Setting the state on this course at the beginning of the 2020s is the $2 billion investment in the Queensland Renewable Energy and Hydrogen Jobs Fund at the heart of the 2021-22 Budget.
“We are seizing the opportunity to establish Queensland as a national leader in a low-carbon economy and create 185,000 jobs, the most out of any state in the country,” said Palaszczuk.
On the back of Brisbane’s successful 2032 Summer Olympics bid, the world is clearly smitten with QLD’s environmental wonders like the Great Barrier Reef, wonders that need serious looking after if they are to be in a fit state to show off in 2032. 
Palaszczuk said that this Climate Action Plan 2030 is designed to protect that unique environment, “and to grow our economy, we must act on climate change and create more jobs in more industries.” 
Environment Minister Scanlon said that QLD is “home to sunshine and wind…home of the new economy minerals…and the skilled workforce who can process and manufacture them. The home of the scientists and innovators who are charging up our hydrogen industry. And the home of millions of hectares of land perfect for new industries like carbon farming, delivering new income opportunities for our farmers while keeping carbon in the ground. Now it is time to seize these opportunities and set Queensland in a nation-leading position for the future.” 
Scanlon also wrote a Minister’s Forward for the Plan, which doesn’t seem to exist on the website, in which she reiterated already released policies and priorities. “Our Queensland Climate Action Plan 2030 includes all the information you need to know about what we’re already doing” wrote Scanlon, “and what we’re going to do in the future.” However, what the QLD government are “going to do in the future” is apparently come up with a Climate Action Plan to fill out the website.
WWF-Australia support 
Ariane Wilkinson, Great Barrier Reef program manager for WWF-Australia, welcomed the Climate Action Plan as an “encouraging step forward in creating a transparent framework to guide how the state will achieve its targets for renewables, emissions reduction, and climate action.” 
“WWF-Australia welcomes the opportunity to work with the Queensland Government through the Climate Action Plan” continued Wilkinson, “to create real action in making Queensland a renewable export superpower and a global leader on climate action.”
But is it a plan or a website?
But is this “Climate Action Plan 2030” just a plan to make a plan? QLD Greens MP Michael Berkman raised questions about the so called “Plan” in a series of tweets. 
Qld Labor has 2030 and 2050 renewables & emissions reductions targets, but nowhere in the ""Plan"" shows any timeline or path to meet those targets.
I asked what interim targets or measures the Govt has to measure progress towards its targets.
— Michael Berkman (@mcberkman) July 30, 2021

 
And during Budget Estimates, according to the Courier Mail, LNP Shadow Minister Sam O’Connor questioned whether any new information or policies were included in this “action plan”.
“I’m a little confused because it appears to just be a collection of policies and strategies which were already released,” said O’Connor. 
According to Scanlon the Plan is a “living document”, and Environment Department director-general Jamie Merrick said the reason for launching the website was because it was “live”. Berkman called this a joke. “A real climate action plan needs a timeline for emissions reduction and workforce transition, with specific measures to phase out coal and gas and rapidly ramp up renewables.”

Originally approved as a 250 MW project in May 2019, Acciona’s application has been approved to expand the original development to the area surrounding Powerlink’s Larcom Creek Terminal Station, an expansion that will see the proposed AUD$550 million Aldoga Solar Farm reach a capacity of up to 600 MWp, enough to supply approximately 222,000 QLD households annually. 
The expanded deal comes off the back of the QLD government’s “Advancing our cities and regions strategy” which has agreed to lease Acciona underutilised state land from Economic Development Queensland for 30 years. Of course, the project will be a great help to the government’s 50% renewable energy target by 2030 goal. 
Although no firm construction dates have been set, Acciona plans to construct the PV plant in phases, with the first phase to have a 315 MWp capacity, and the second phase to be built in support of the development of a green hydrogen industry in Gladstone.
Acciona says construction will create up to 350 construction jobs and 10 permanent operational positions.
The Aldoga project will be Acciona’s second solar park in Australia, after Royalla’s 20 MW solar park, which it connected in 2014 as a contractor for Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV).

“The demand for lithium-ion batteries is increasing globally, fuelled by the increasing electrification of transport and the renewable energy generation storage sector,” said Dr Anand Bhatt, lead author of the Australian Landscape for Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling and Reuse in 2020 report.
“This growth is leading to an emerging problem of end-of-life waste management,” Bhatt continued. Indeed, CSIRO research showed that lithium-ion battery waste is growing by 20% a year and could exceed 100,000 tonnes by 2036.
According to Jo Staines, Enterprise Fellow at the University of Melbourne and program lead for the Future Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre (FBICRC), incorrect disposal is also a missed economic opportunity. “Lithium-ion batteries contain valuable battery metals and materials that should be recycled and reused,” Staines said. According to the FBICRC this lost value could translate from a $603 million to $3.1 billion opportunity. If recycled, 95 per cent of materials can be turned into new batteries or used in other high value industries.

However, as Evans said in a statement, “Our current battery recycling rate is just not good enough. Accreditation of the scheme gives both the public and industry assurance that the scheme aligns with Australia’s circular economy principles.” 

“I’m putting all battery importers and retailers on notice that the government expects them to participate in the scheme to meet their recycling and waste reduction obligations,” continued Evans. 
However, the government’s statement made no mention of the residential or large-scale energy storage sector, preferring to focus on recovering and recycling “button batteries and the batteries we all routinely find ourselves replacing as consumers including AAs and AAAs.” 
Libby Chaplin, CEO of the Battery Stewardship Council (BSC) which will administer the Battery Stewardship Scheme, said this marks a pivotal step in the BSC’s journey towards launching a national collection network by January 2022. 
“The BSC is very pleased with the announcement from the Australian government that our application for accrediation has been successful. This will give confidence to the battery collection and recycling industry to invest in infrastructure for collection and processing.
