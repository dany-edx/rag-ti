The CEFC invested in the project as part of a syndicate of lenders including Dutch-headquartered financial group ING and Japanese financial institution Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC).
The Blue Grass solar farm, located 14km west of Chinchilla in the Darling Downs Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), is X-Elio’s first major project in Australia and its largest to date and is expected to generate 420 GWh of green energy annually when complete.
The 200 MW solar plant, which will connect to the grid via the existing Chinchilla to Columboola transmission line, is expected to offset approximately 320,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year.
X-Elio’s Australian country manager Belinda Fan said the Blue Grass solar project represents the opening phase of the company’s long-term interest in Australia’s energy transition with full commercial operations expected in Q1 2022.
“We’re thrilled to have achieved financial close for the Blue Grass Solar Farm – our largest solar project in Australia and one that strengthens our position in the domestic renewables market where we continue to pursue new growth opportunities,” she said.
“This includes more than 600 MW of projects in our development pipeline which is growing exponentially each year.
“X-Elio is a global business with a local mindset, and we are committed to enhancing economic and social outcomes in the local communities and regions where we operate.”
CEFC chief executive Ian Learmonth said the government-owned green bank’s $37 million investment in the project supports the “latest solar technology” to further strengthen the nation’s renewable energy grid while supporting the Australian Renewable Energy Agency-led (ARENA) “30 30 30” initiative that is designed to achieve ultra low-cost solar.
The initiative aims for solar PV to achieve 30% efficiency at 30 cents per installed watt by 2030 and is expected to help drive down costs to meet the goal of solar electricity generation at $15 per MWh.

The Blue Grass Solar Farm features an estimated 375,000 bifacial solar modules, which Learmonth said have an increased generation capacity compared with existing panels, as well as half-cut cells technology which reduces the cell to half the normal size.
“Blue Grass Solar Farm will include the latest technology that this innovative sector can deliver and will truly be a solar farm for the 21st century,” he said.
Learmonth said the CEFC’s commitment is its 32nd solar farm investment since inception and a further demonstration of the critical role it plays in Australia’s transition to net zero emissions.
“This latest renewable energy investment demonstrates that CEFC expertise and capital is central to the ongoing evolution of the sector,” he said.
“Since our earliest investments, the CEFC has been instrumental to the development of renewable energy capacity, which is pivotal to cutting emissions across our economy.
“With this latest investment we are proud to have contributed to the delivery of more than 3.5 GW of low-emissions generating capacity, including 2 GW of solar and 1.5 GW of wind. This clean energy will underpin our energy transition for generations to come.”
Learmonth said the investment builds on new renewable energy investment commitments by the CEFC of $810 million in 2020–21, representing a 53% increase on the $529 million of the previous year and reflecting its investments in large-scale battery projects and the landmark Snowy 2.0 grid infrastructure expansion.
“The transition to net-zero emissions requires substantial decarbonisation, at a much faster pace than we are currently achieving,” he said. “One of the most effective ways to do that is to fortify Australia’s renewable energy sector and reduce the cost of solar PV generation to help meet stretch targets for technologies such as green hydrogen, low-emissions steel and aluminium.”

X-Elio’s successful financial close for the Blue Grass Solar Farm comes more than one year after it announced a “landmark” virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) for the output of the solar plant with US-based software company Salesforce.
X-Elio said it had signed a 10-year agreement with Salesforce which will purchase 25% of the Blue Grass output, contributing to its commitment to reach 100% renewable energy by 2022. It is the US tech giant’s first renewable energy offtake agreement in Australia.
The Queensland Government-owned generation company Stanwell will also purchase a share of energy generation, to help meet customer demand for green energy and contribute towards Queensland’s ambition to generate 50% of its electricity needs from renewables by 2030.
X-Elio, which is co-owned by US investment firms Brookfield and KKR, said the Blue Grass project represents the opening phase of the company’s long-term interest in Australia’s energy transition where it plans to leverage its 17 years’ experience as a global leader in the development, construction and operation of solar PV projects, having built 2.6 GW solar PV plants across more than 10 markets globally.
X-Elio currently has 25 solar plants in operation in 13 countries, including the 42 MW Marcovia solar farm in Honduras and the Guanajuato solar farm in Mexico. The company is also developing the Forest Glen (120 MW) and Wunghnu (80 MW) solar farms in New South Wales and Victoria respectively.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/20/icg-snaps-up-majority-stake-in-300-mw-solar-pv-and-storage-portfolio/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 20, 2022",ICG snaps up majority stake in ~300 MW solar PV and storage portfolio,"Sydney-headquartered Infrastructure Capital Group (ICG) announced it will acquire a majority interest in a solar and energy storage portfolio comprising more than 40 operational and proposed PV projects from renewable energy developer Providence Asset Group.
ICG, which has about $3.5 billion of equity under management, said it had made an initial $100 million commitment to buy the projects, known as the Ginan Solar Portfolio, with the option to significantly scale the investment further to include co-located batteries and hydrogen. ICG said it will also look at opportunities beyond the initial development pipeline.
Under the terms of the transaction, to be made by ICG through its Australian Renewables Income Fund (ARIF), ARIF will take a majority interest in 16 operational solar sites in Victoria totalling 132 MWdc /73 MWac, with exclusive rights to develop a further 25 solar projects across New South Wales (NSW), totalling a further 156 MWdc /115 MWac.
The Victorian portfolio includes ~5 MW solar farms at Katamatite, Numurkah, Echuca and Stanhope while the development pipeline includes solar projects at Manilla, South Tamworth, Guyra and Gunnedah in NSW, taking the total portfolio to almost 40 ~5 MW solar farms across both states.
Each site consists of a ~5 MW distribution-connected solar PV plant which ICG said offers numerous advantages over large-scale projects, including speed of approval, construction, and connection. ICG said the small-scale plants also allow for flexibility in deploying various types of energy storage, including hydrogen and batteries.
ICG also said the offtake from the small-scale projects can be aggregated for ‘networked off-take’ under various power purchase agreements (PPAs).

An aggregated offtake agreement is already in place for 10 of the sites in Victoria with Providence last year signing a multi-year PPA with SmartestEnergy Australia, a subsidiary of Japanese investment giant Marubeni Corporation.
ICG managing director Tom Laidlaw said the acquisition of the Ginan Solar Portfolio also provides the company with “a low-risk opportunity to enter the green hydrogen market” through LAVO, an integrated hydrogen energy storage system and patented metal hydride storage technology developed by Providence.
Providence announced last year it would install the LAVO technology at its solar farms in regional Victoria after finalising a $33 million project financing agreement with the Commonwealth Bank (CBA).
Providence co-founder and chief investment officer Alan Yu said this week the operational solar farm at Stanhope will pilot LAVO’s hydrogen technology in Q1 2022 to assess the broader deployment of hydrogen storage technology and monitor the wider development of the industry.
“We are pleased to be working with the ICG team as they diversify into solar for the first time and look to incorporate new clean energy technology across this portfolio as well as ICG’s managed assets,” he said.
Laidlaw said opportunities may exist to deploy the LAVO technology not only across the Providence portfolio but also several ICG portfolio companies, assets and future acquisitions.

“We are delighted to be investing in and partnering with Providence Asset Group in what is a unique and scalable portfolio of clean energy generation assets,” he said.
“This is our first investment into operating solar assets, providing further diversification of the existing ARIF portfolio consisting of wind and hydro.
“Importantly it also provides the opportunity to assess long-duration hydrogen storage applications across ICG-managed assets.”
The Providence deal is ICG’s sixth transaction in the past 24 months, including its recent acquisition of the Meridian Energy Australia assets as part of a $729 million with global oil and gas giant Shell.
Following completion of the transaction, ICG assumed ownership of MEA’s portfolio of renewable energy generation assets, including the Burrinjuck and Keepit hydro power stations in NSW, the 131 MW Mount Mercer Wind Farm in Victoria and the 70 MW Mount Millar Wind Farm in South Australia, and development projects including the 20 MW/40 MWh Hume battery energy storage system (BESS) set to be installed alongside the 200 GWh Hume Hydroelectric Power Station in regional NSW.
ICG said the latest acquisition means it is now invested in operating renewable energy generation assets with a total capacity of 1,16 GWac across wind, hydro and solar assets while development pipeline more than 2.75 GWac of wind, hydro, solar and storage opportunities.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/20/four-ways-to-stop-australias-surge-in-rooftop-solar-from-destabilising-electricity-prices/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JANUARY 20, 2022",Four ways to stop Australia’s surge in rooftop solar from destabilising electricity prices,"Alongside the greater uptake of utility-scale solar (such as solar farms), this means cheaper and cleaner electricity is fast becoming a reality, putting the country on track to meet international climate targets.
But such a dramatic surge in solar output also poses challenges for Australia’s power system for two main reasons.
It results in increased periods of large oversupply when weather conditions favour solar energy. This leads to energy being wasted due to the need for solar curtailment – when a solar system shuts down or stops exporting energy to the grid to counter the energy spike.
On the other hand, there is little solar generation during peak demand hours in the morning and evening. This requires more expensive generators to run.
These are huge problems from a market operations perspective, as the pressure on the system may result in blackouts and disruptions. It also creates large price swings for retailers, which then can increase costs for consumers. As a result, we may see it become more expensive to decarbonise the national energy market.
We propose four ways to combat this growing, volatile issue, according to findings from our recent research.
Investment in solar has increased significantly since 2018 as it became the cheapest form of new power-generation technology.
In fact, the Australian Energy Market Operator’s latest Integrated System Plan, released last month, predicts coal plants to close three times faster than industries had expected.
Image: Maoneng
Australia has one of the highest per-capita rooftop solar installation rates in the world, with rooftop and utility-scale solar already meeting over 100% of demand in South Australia.
By 2050, we expect to see five times more rooftop solar capacity.
As solar generation is so cheap, traditional coal and gas generators are getting pushed out as a source of base-load electricity supply.
This is especially acute in the middle of the day, when solar generation is greatest as the sun is shining at its peak. This results in low prices, or even in negative prices, which financially penalises any generators making power at those times. Curtailment is then used to offset any oversupply or negative prices.
Electricity demand, however, tends to peak during the morning and evening when most people are home. Prices skyrocket during these periods as gas and coal-fired power stations benefit from the reduced competition from solar energy.

Coal plants are closing extremely quickly.
For retailers, these huge price swings are extremely inefficient. And this inefficiency in the market may eventually be reflected in consumer prices. What’s more, too much solar curtailment can hurt the rooftop solar owner because it reduces the amount of generation coming from their systems.
This price variability can also undermine the stability of the power system. This is because solar systems, both large and small, do not inherently provide certain services needed to keep the lights on, such as “system strength” and “inertia”.
Such services are currently largely provided by coal and other thermal plants, whose very existence is under threat by additional solar.
Utility-scale solar output looks very different to rooftop PV output over the course of a day, as the utility-scale solar panels rotate to track the sun. On the other hand, rooftop solar systems are generally fixed in orientation.
We found this difference in output leads to different price impacts. Utility-scale solar output reduces price variability, while rooftop solar output increases it. This means we have a greater need for managing rooftop solar.
Image: Worksafe Victoria
Our research proposes four ways we can better align solar output with electricity demand. This can reduce both the level and volatility of electricity prices, benefiting consumers without undermining the stability of the power system.
Australians with rooftop solar should be eligible for government grants, rebates, and loans to support their systems with batteries. This will enable owners to store extra power generation during the day and export it to the national grid later in the evening to meet the peak demand.
The Australian Energy Market Operator should design dynamic and flexible export management measures to absorb excess rooftop generation. This will efficiently control the generated energy going into the grid by taking into account demand and supply conditions in real time, improving the system security.
The operator has recently developed such measures for South Australia, but they’ll also be useful to other regions.
Currently, people who own rooftop solar are paid a fixed or “flat-rate” tariff for the electricity they provide to the grid, regardless of time of the day.
Instead, we need to transition from fixed to dynamic tariffs. These dynamic “feed-in” tariffs would be lower during the day and higher in the morning and evening peaks to incentivise rooftop owners to inject their electricity into the grid when it’s more valuable.
Australia’s energy market is heavily one-sided, with suppliers having the flexibility to, for example, set prices and dispatch energy.
A two-sided market will allow both supply and demand sides to participate in the dispatch and price setting process. This will enable electricity demand to be more flexible, and better align energy usage with solar and wind generation.
Such a market will allow increased output of renewables to be translated to lower electricity prices.
We rely on solar energy as a key technology to help Australia decarbonise the energy market by 2050. To maximise the benefits of solar generation, Australia urgently needs a coordinated response from policymakers, energy providers and consumers. And crucially, it will enable Australia to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/20/maoneng-gets-green-light-for-190-million-mornington-peninsula-big-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 20, 2022",Maoneng gets green light for $190 million Mornington Peninsula big battery,"Sydney-based renewables developer Maoneng has confirmed that its $190 million Mornington battery energy storage system (BESS), to be built near Tyabb on the Victorian coast south-east of Melbourne, has received development approval from the state government.
The standalone BESS facility will be located adjacent to AusNet’s existing Tyabb substation on the Mornington Peninsula is expected to be completed by mid-2023. It will draw and store energy from the grid during off-peak periods and dispatch energy to the grid during peak periods, generating power for the equivalent of 40,000 average Australian homes.
Maoneng said in a statement the two-hours’ duration battery will support the Victorian government’s objective of improving the reliability of regional electricity in an area that is particularly exposed to fluctuations in demand, primarily as a result of seasonal tourism.
Maoneng co-founder and CEO Morris Zhou said the approval demonstrated the project’s value in supporting the network, the surrounding neighbours and the environment.
“The Mornington BESS will be a vital piece of local infrastructure that will benefit the local economy in several ways,” he said.
“It will help stabilise the network and manage periods of peak demand when local companies and households really need reliable electricity.”

Zhou has previously said batteries will play an increasingly important and necessary role as Australia transitions from traditional energy sources to renewable energy, a sentiment backed by Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) chief executive Darren Miller.
ARENA earlier this month announced a $100 million competitive funding round for grid-scale batteries which Miller said will play a crucial role in accelerating the transition to renewable energy.
“Grid-scale batteries and other types of energy storage technology will be vital to support our future electricity system powered by renewables,” he said.
The Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) Draft 2022 Integrated System Plan forecasts that almost all of Australia’s coal-fired electricity generation will retire by 2040, to be replaced by wind and solar farms backed up by at least 30 GW of grid-scale firming capacity capable of responding to a dispatch signal.
While there are seven big batteries currently in operation on the National Electricity Market (NEM), AEMO has identified a further 23,418 MW of battery storage capacity in the planning pipeline.
Maoneng said it expects to announce an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor for the Mornington BESS in the coming weeks.
“There are also commercial opportunities during construction, and more work on the supply chain will begin soon as our contractor comes on board and begins the process of hiring individuals, companies and equipment suppliers as the project gets up to speed,” Zhou said.
Maoneng said the $190 million project is expected to generate up to 160 full-time equivalent jobs during its 12-month construction phase.
Maoneng
The Mornington BESS forms part of Maoneng’s bold plan to build more than 1.8 GWh of utility-scale battery energy storage system projects across Australia, including the Gould Creek BESS near Adelaide in South Australia.
Maoneng has already obtained planning approval from the South Australian government for the 225 MWp/450 MWh two-hours’ duration project, which is to be located next to the Para transmission substation, just over 20km from the state capital’s CBD.
Construction is set to begin on the battery in late 2022, with the project expected to be fully commissioned by the end of 2023.
Maoneng also has three other standalone battery storage projects on the go, with about 400 MW spread between sites at Lismore and Tamworth and the Sunraysia solar farm site near Balranald in south-west New South Wales.
Maoneng, which co-owns the 200 MW Sunraysia Solar Farm and operates the smaller 13 MW Mugga Lane Solar Park in the Australian Capital Territory, has plans to install a 50 MW/100 MWh big battery at the Sunraysia site.

Nitricity is using solar electricity to extract nitrogen directly from our air to produce nitric acid, the most critical nutrient in fertiliser that plants use to grow everything we humans eat. The key features of the company’s product are the decarbonisation, decentralisation and privatisation of fertiliser manufacturing, made possible by affordable, off-grid, intermittent solar electricity.

The company installed its first commercial project in October. The off-grid solar power system features 144 solar panels, but details describing the solar hardware are scant. On its website, Nitricity shares an experimental report on its pilot project in Fresno, California. The initial installation’s solar system was a 16-panel ground-mount array that outputted 75V to 85V, with a maximum power of 2.4kW.
The installation was coupled directly with a sub-surface irrigation system for a tomato crop. The paper covers the apparent success of the hardware, which produced tomatoes in a volume and quality that were similar to the control tomatoes. The control tomatoes received a standard, industrially produced nitrogen fertiliser.
Pilot project
Nitricty believes that its product will fill several niches. Because the system is easily distributed, farmers located far from fertiliser manufacturing centres will have additional financial incentive to try out the new technology.
The company’s process directly competes with industrial ammonia production – a process which directly creates more CO2 than any other human-driven chemical process on earth. The primary feedstock for modern nitrogen fixation is natural gas. The processing of the gas into ammonia releases these emissions. The chemical process emissions are only part of the story, as the emissions released from the fossil fuels traditionally used to heat and sustain the reaction are also excessive.
In its favour, the Haber-Bosch process was largely responsible for the Green Revolution of the middle 1900s, which helped catapult the global population. It is estimated that nearly half of all nitrogen currently found in human tissue was produced using this process.
Additionally, Niticity’s distributed, localised nitrogen solution also avoids transportation emissions. The company points out that market inefficiencies related to the distribution process of fossil-sourced nitrogen fertilisers can increase a farmer’s fertiliser cost as much as two to five times above the costs at a factory. Fossil-based fertiliser production costs are also volatile due to their direct relationship with natural gas – which, as mentioned earlier, supplies the primary feedstock for industrial ammonia.

In December, the US Department of Energy’s ARPA Energy awarded the group US$500,000 (AU$690,000) to advance their “non-thermal plasma reactor” process. ARPA notes that “literature and modelling analysis suggest that an energy efficiency 10 times better than present plasma values and equal to or better than that of the conventional Haber-Bosch process could be achieved.”
In an interview with Agrifood Conversations, the company noted that the intermittent nature of solar power is not only easily managed, but is actually a desired trait. According to one of Nitricity’s founders, Nicolas Pinkowski, the process “operates better intermittently. Because we manufacture nitrates (NO3-), there is a lot of oxygen to transport per lb of nitrogen.” Nitricity uses a 200-gallon tank to store the product prior to it being applied to the tomatoes.
In August, the company raised US$5 million (AU$7 million). Recently, Nitricity announced that it signed a deal with a wheat producer by releasing some emissions-focused math:
Nitricity’s technology mitigates nearly 100% of these emissions.
It could be that these fertilisation systems will integrate with solar powered greenhouses and other responsible land management techniques. In doing so, solar power will likely prove to be indispensable to our future food production.

However, Western Australia’s McGowan Government has today released the results from some of its own funded studies which tout the potential of the state’s own hydrogen future. 
At the third Hydrogen Production, Storage, and Infrastructure Development Global Summit, being held virtually this year, WA Hydrogen Industry Minister Alannah MacTiernan cited the newly released reports into the transmission and storage of hydrogen. 
“The WA Government has committed $160 million to making sure Western Australia reaches its potential and becomes a global supplier of renewable hydrogen,” said MacTiernan. 
“Our commitment includes funding a range of studies that will inform the development of Western Australia’s hydrogen industry.”
One feasibility study, prepared by the operator of the Dampier Bunbury Pipeline (DBNGP) the Australian Gas Infrastructure Group (AGIG), and funded by WA’s Renewable Hydrogen Fund, outlines a pathway for sections of the DBNGP to use up to 9% hydrogen/natural gas blends.  
According to the study, “there is now a clear pathway for declaring a pipeline section as suitable for use with hydrogen/natural gas blends. This pathway includes material testing, additional operational constraints and a realignment of regulatory and commercial frameworks.” 
AGIG reviewed 42 independent pipeline sections for suitability to hydrogen transportation with the purpose of identifying the concentration of hydrogen with an effect upon pipeline safety and performance that would be “negligible.” This concentration up to a partial pressure of 500kPag, is the 9% blend mentioned across “many” of the sections of DBNGP. The particular sections of the pipeline best suited to blended hydrogen/gas are “Mainline South”, between Kwinana and Bunbury, and DBNGP Laterals, including sections of pipeline extending out to mining and industrial hubs. 

Underground, underwhelming 
MacTiernan has also released the first stage of a report into the potential to store hydrogen in depleted oil and gas fields. The study, commissioned by the Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) and prepared by RISC Advisory, conducted a literature review and scoping study of the potential for underground hydrogen storage in aquifers, salt caverns, underground mine sites and tunnels. 
Of the 23 onshore deleted gas and oil fields in WA considered in the study RISC “identified seven fields as good candidates for hydrogen storage projects along the West Coast.” However, unfortunately, the proposed 50GW Western Green Energy Hub (WGEH) and the 23GW Asian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) “are located over 1,000km away from suitable depleted fields.” 
“A more encouraging method of underground storage for the AREH project is subsurface salt,” continued the study. However there are no salt deposits mapped within the region of the WGEH. For these reasons RISC recommends surface storage for these large-scale green hydrogen hubs. 

This is frustrating considering research from Future Fuels Cooperative Research Centre (FFCRC), an industry-focussed research, development and demonstration partnership, has mapped Australia’s UHS capacity at potentially 310 million tonnes (38,000 PJ), a figure approximately 60 times larger than what a developed domestic and export Australian hydrogen industry would need, which FFCRC estimates at around five million tonnes (600 PJ). 
“As we start producing more and more hydrogen,” said MacTiernan, “we need to know how we are going to safely move and store it around the State. The two reports we have released today identify steps for making sure we have the infrastructure required for the transmission and storage of hydrogen in Western Australia.”

Dutch architectural firm MVRDV has designed and deployed a building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system on a building owned by Taiwan’s state-owned power utility Taipower.
“We cladded the entire façade with photovoltaics, maximising the energy gains to make it not only self-sustainable, for its own usage, but also allowing the building to become a tool of energy production, exporting electricity to the rest of the grid,” said MVRDV founding partner Winy Maas.
The Sun Rock building is located at the Changhua Coastal Industrial Park, near Taichung, and its primary purpose is for the storage and maintenance of sustainable energy equipment. “The site for Taipower’s new facility receives a significant amount of solar exposure throughout the year, and so the rounded shape of Sun Rock is designed to maximise how much of that sunlight can be harnessed for energy,” MVRDV said in a statement.

According to the company, the solar array is exposed to higher radiation on the southern side during the middle of the day, while electricity generation is maximised by the northern side in the mornings and evenings.
The BIPV system was built with a series of pleats that support photovoltaic panels and the modules mixed in with windows, where required, on their upper surface.
“The angle of these pleats is adjusted on all parts of the façade to maximise the energy-generating potential of the solar panels,” MVRDV explained. “As a result of these measures, the building can support at least 4,000 square meters of PV panels that would generate almost 1 million kilowatt-hours of clean energy per year.”
No more technical details on the project were disclosed.
