Neoen’s first-half 2022 consolidated revenue totalled AU$328 million (€224 million), up 36% compared to the first six months of 2021, it announced in its most recent earnings report. The company noted a key factor driving the growth was newly commissioned assets in Australia, namely its Victorian Big Battery.
The 300 MW/450 MWh Victorian Big Battery (VBB) in Geelong is currently the largest commissioned battery in Australia. According to Cornwall Insight Australia, Neoen posted an estimated AEMO wholesale net revenue of just over $13 million for the three-month period for the asset.
“It represents just over 8% of the project’s finance costs (costing $160m for the design, construction, and operation),” Cornwall’s William Curtis noted.
“The high turnover in Q2 2022 is not limited to VBB. Estimates for Hornsdale [Power Reserve] were around $10 million, and Wandoan at just under $5 million in Q2 2022,” it added.
“On a captured prices front, state-wide battery generation weighted average prices sat at $992/MWh in QLD, $653/MWh in NSW, $585/MWh in SA, and $363/MWh in VIC. A significant increase in recent history. 
“Given that Q2 2021 saw FCAS account for 78% of revenue, it appears there has been a significant change in opportunities and focus.”
Given the surging wholesale energy prices in Australia, energy arbitrage’s opportunities “have never been more apparent,” Curtis says.
Neoen has the biggest portfolio of operational and planned utility-scale batteries Australia today, sitting at 576 MW. Late last year it begun construction of its 100 MW/200 MWh Capital Battery near Canberra and announced plans for 300MW and 800MWh battery in Blyth, north of Adelaide. The company is aiming to have a grid-scale battery in each of the five states participating in the National Electricity Market.
Neoen this week also announced it had signed a 10-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with retailer Flow Power for 40 MW of energy from its Goyder South Stage 1 project, part of the company’s flagship Goyder Renewables Zone – a hybrid wind, solar and storage project located near Burra in South Australia’s mid north.

The Goyder South Stage 1 wind farm, currently under construction, will have a total capacity of 412 MW and operations are expected to commence in 2024.
Goyder South has development approval for a total of 1200 MW of wind generation, 600 MW of solar generation and 900 MW of battery storage capacity, making it the state’s largest renewable project.
It is the second offtake deal inked for the project, the first being with the Australian Capital Territory’s (ACT) government which previously agreed to source electricity from the Goyder wind farm, allowing Canberra’s electricity supply will continue to be sourced from 100% renewable electricity in the coming years.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/03/company-behind-australias-most-advanced-vanadium-project-embroiled-in-leadership-fight-amid-shareholder-activism/,"LEGAL,AUSTRALIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"AUGUST 3, 2022",Company behind Australia’s most advanced vanadium project embroiled in leadership fight amid shareholder activism,"Perth-based company TNG Limited has found itself at the centre of a meticulously planned shareholder campaign to remove its CEO and chairman over claims the company’s leadership “does not hold the breadth and depth of experience necessary to prosper and navigate the complexities of project permissioning in the Northern Territory” and has “lost the confidence of financial markets.”
TNG owns the Mount Peake Vanadium-Titanium-Iron Project, located 230km north of Alice Springs, which is aiming to produce around 6,000 tonnes of vanadium pentoxide annually to be used for vanadium redox flow batteries. 
The project is expected to become a top 10 global producer of vanadium, with the mine itself sitting alongside TNG’s proprietary TIVAN technology, which the company says allows it to “overcome limitations of the conventional processing.” It plans to build its processing facility in Darwin’s Middle Arm Precinct.
The project is in the advanced stages, having received Major Project Status from the federal Government in 2021 and finalising its front-end engineering design (FEED) study, completed by another major shareholder, Germany’s SMS Group – one of the world’s largest metallurgical engineering companies.
What the leadership challenge will mean for the Mount Peake Project is, at this stage, uncertain.
The shareholder campaign is being fronted by Australian Financial Review columnist and ex-hedge fund manager Grant Wilson, who on July 20 formally challenged the TNG board through 249D of the Corporations Act which allows significant shareholders to force the company into a general meeting, in this case to vote on the current leadership. 
TNG this morning responded to the move, urging shareholders to vote against the “removal of three of its four directors.”
The company said handing control of the its board to Grant Wilson, who is proposing he himself take over as chief executive for the time being, alongside Anthony Robinson as proposed chairman, would “disrupt TNG’s recent momentum and cause unknown consequences.”
Grant Wilson holds an 8.82% shareholder voting right in TNG, and is backed by Warren and Marilyn Brown, who own a 6.16% stake in the company.
The Browns appear to have also been behind another activist shareholder campaign against the company in 2018, which was described by the AFR as “highly disruptive”.
The primary criticism among the group of shareholders is the slow progress of the project, which in 2015 had promised to begin construction in 2018. This “take off” date has been setback a number of times, with the shareholder campaign on its website claiming its leadership team has “failed” to manage the environmental approval outcome in Darwin.
“Significant risks persist in the environmental approval process for the integrated operation at the Mount Peake mine site,” it adds. The campaign also criticised the company’s failure to deliver an updated capital cost estimate for the Mount Peake Project in the second quarter of this year.
Grant Wilson is currently moving through Australia holding meetings as part of the campaign “roadshow” – with the final meeting scheduled for this Friday in Perth following gatherings in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra.
His move has set off an outpouring of discussion on HotCopper.com‘s forums among TNG’s minor shareholders, with some supporting the campaign to oust the leadership, who they too blame for the “plethora of missed timelines” and “stuttering progress.”
Meanwhile, others have questioned the what the radical shift would do at this stage of the project and how it would impact offtake agreements and partnerships.
TNG’s current CEO and Managing Director, Paul Burton, who is at the centre of the controversy, has also questioned whether a former hedge fund manager would have the experience to run a mining company, according to the AFR.
He also pointed out that Wilson, who has publicly described himself as the “proposed chair of TNG” has never held any role with, or acted as an advisor to, TNG. “Mr Wilson does not represent, or have any right to represent, TNG in any discussions regarding the Mount Peake Project or the business of TNG,” the company said.
TNG said it will send out notice of a general company meeting discussing the issue “no later than 10 August 2022.”

Recent extreme weather events have underscored the need to cut the CO₂ emissions that are driving up global temperatures. This requires a rapid transition of the energy economy to renewable energy sources, the cheapest being solar photovoltaics (PV). And our newly published research points to a way we can drive down costs of the shift even further using cheaper forms of silicon for highly efficient solar panels.
Australia has been leading the way with solar PV installations, but our solar energy journey is just beginning. This year, humanity hit a milestone of 1 terawatt (TW) – 1 million × 1 million watts – of installed solar capacity. However, experts predict 70TW of solar PV may be needed by 2050 to power all sectors of the economy.
To help drive this rapid uptake of solar PV, we need solar panels that are high efficiency and low cost. Over the past ten years, some new solar cell designs have led to record high efficiencies. The problem is these designs also need higher-quality materials, which cost more.
Our recent research suggests we might be able to rethink the type of silicon needed to make these high-efficiency solar cells.

More than 95% of solar panels are made using silicon. The silicon used to make solar cells is similar to that used in computer chips. It’s effectively very pure sand.
To make a solar cell work, we need to form an electric field so the generated current can all flow in one direction. This is done by adding impurity atoms into silicon, a process known as “doping”.
In commercial panel manufacturing, the most commonly used type of silicon is “p-type” silicon. This material is doped with atoms that have one less electron than silicon, such as boron or more recently gallium.
We can then introduce a very thin layer on the surface full of atoms with one extra electron relative to silicon, which is called “n-type” silicon. Placing these two types of silicon together forms what is called a “p-n junction”. The massive difference in the number of electrons between the p-type region and n-type region forces electrons to move rapidly, creating an electric field that drives the current in our solar cell.
Conventional solar panels on Australian roofs today are overwhelmingly made using p-type silicon, as it is about 10% cheaper than the alternative “n-type” silicon, doped with phosphorus.
Researchers are continually pushing to drive up the efficiency of solar panels so they can generate more power for consumers. In 2017, a record efficiency of 26.7% was achieved for a silicon solar cell. Last month, LONGi Solar announced an efficiency of 26.5% – very close to the world record – for the same type of solar cell made in a manufacturing environment, rather than in a laboratory.
As of today, the highest lab efficiency of monocrystalline solar cells is 26.7%.https://t.co/cucR3YCruD pic.twitter.com/bYmIa1khMP

This type of solar cell is called a “silicon heterojunction”. The special element of silicon heterojunction solar cells is that the surface is capped with a very thin layer – about 1,000 times thinner than a human hair – of amorphous silicon. This thin layer smooths the surface and reduces a lot of the energy losses.
Sanyo developed this cell design in the 1990s. At the time, high-quality n-type silicon wafers were used to make silicon heterojunction cells, even though these wafers are more expensive.
The main reason for this is that sunlight degrades cheaper p-type wafers. However, our understanding of this phenomenon and how to treat it has come a long way since the 1990s.
For the past 30 years, all silicon heterojunction solar cells, including the record-breaking cells, have been made using n-type silicon wafers. In our research project, we wanted to test whether cheaper, p-type wafers could also be used.
Through comprehensive testing, we found heterojunction solar cells made with p-type silicon did not perform as well. We were puzzled by this. But one day we had a literal light-bulb moment.
We realised that accidental exposure to room lighting for as little as ten seconds before testing reduced the voltage of p-type cells by as much as 30mV, which can cut their efficiency by a percentage point (i.e. from 22% to 21%). This was causing our cells to perform much worse than expected. Much like someone who has severe allergies is more sensitive to pollen in the spring, we realised these high-efficiency silicon heterojunction solar cells made with p-type wafers are much more sensitive to light-induced degradation.
We believe this observation is the reason high-efficiency cells have only previously been explored using expensive silicon. Past researchers were unaware of the sensitivity of p-type wafers to degrade and did not have the knowledge to overcome it.
Fortunately, we now know the bonding of boron and unwanted oxygen in the silicon wafer causes this degradation. Treatments with a high-intensity laser have been shown to stabilise cells in a matter of seconds.
The laser illumination can make hydrogen, which is already floating around in the silicon, more mobile to move around and “passivate” the unwanted boron-oxygen defects. Exactly how hydrogen does this is still an active area of research, but we know it solves the problem. Our research confirms a short laser treatment can stabilise the performance of p-type silicon heterojunction solar cells.
Armed with this new knowledge, we can further develop high-efficiency technologies with cheaper raw materials. This will reduce the cost of every watt of solar electricity produced. In March this year, solar panel manufacturer LONGi Solar announced an efficiency of 25.47% for a silicon heterojunction solar cell made using p-type wafers.
To see manufacturers making high-efficiency solar cells that are potentially cheaper means our findings have a tangible impact on industry. Reducing solar cell costs will provide cheaper electricity to millions of consumers while addressing climate change.
