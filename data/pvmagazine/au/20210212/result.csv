The $3.6 million Loganholme project will comprise about 3,000 solar modules installed across 3700 sqm with construction to start next month. The installation, which will reduce the water treatment plant’s reliance on grid-supplied electricity, is part of a $100 million upgrade of the plant.
Work is also expected to commence soon on a 1.3 MW solar PV facility comprising 3,042 modules at the Glenmore Water Treatment Plant, to be built near Fitzroy River Water’s headquarters in Parkhurst.
Rockhampton Mayor Tony Williams said he couldn’t wait to see the $2.6 million project get started, with council telling pv magazine work will commence in May or June.
“We are serious about building a sustainable future, and this is a great stride in that direction,” Williams said.
“Back in the 2018 Budget we created the Sustainable Rockhampton Investment Fund to support initiatives that will deliver a cleaner, greener future for the region, and building this solar facility was something we really wanted to try and make happen.
“I’m delighted that we are going to see that vision become a reality before the end of the year.”

Solgen, one of the nation’s largest providers of commercial solar power systems, has secured the contract to construct the Glenmore solar PV farm.
The Sydney-based solar engineering, procurement and construction contractor is no stranger to delivering solar solutions for councils having recently installed four small-scale solar farms, totalling 1.7 MW across five of Cairns Regional Council’s wastewater treatment plants.
Fitzroy River Water manager Dr Jason Plumb said while Solgen’s tender submission had been great value for money, the innovative design features the company proposed had also proven attractive.
“There will be single-axis tracking and the use of bifacial solar panels to increase the power generation capacity, as well as using crushed recycled glass from council as a ground treatment to increase solar reflection and power generation using the double-sided panels,” Plumb said.
Councillor Donna Kirkland said the solar array would provide considerable savings.
“Once constructed we will be able to save between 30% and 50% of the $1m per year electricity bill we have for the Glenmore WTP,” she said.
The announcements are part of recent a deluge of solar PV facilities being installed at water treatment plants in Australia.
In December, South Australian utility SA Water announced construction had commenced on a 12 MW solar PV system at the Happy Valley Reservoir near Adelaide. Earlier that month, Melbourne Water confirmed construction would begin on one of the largest behind-the-meter solar power installations in Australia with a 19 MW solar farm to be installed at the  Eastern Treatment Plant in Melbourne.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/12/city-council-provides-free-rooftop-system-as-part-of-solar-program/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 12, 2021",City council provides free rooftop system as part of solar program,"The City of Yarra, located in inner Melbourne, announced this week a 4 kW rooftop solar PV system will be donated to a community organisation as part of the Yarra Solar Program, which is overseen by the Yarra Energy Foundation (YEF).
YEF senior project manager Peter Mercouriou said the program donates 1 kW of solar to a local community organisation for every 100 kW installed in the LGA.
Mercouriou said more than 400 kW of solar had been installed across 100 Yarra rooftops in recent months, meaning one free 4 kW rooftop solar system is now up for grabs.
To be eligible, organisations must be a not-for-profit community organisation based in the City of Yarra, must benefit the community members, own its building or be able to gain landlord approval to install solar panels, and have a rooftop suitable for solar modules.
The giveaway is the second for the YEF-operated program with a 5 kW solar system donated to the Collingwood Children’s Farm in 2020.
Mercouriou told pv magazine the program, which delivers discounted prices on solar products and identifies preferred solar installers, had proven a winner with the Yarra community with more than 100 households taking advantage of it since its inception, despite the challenges presented by the inner-city location and the Covid-19 pandemic.
“There are certainly some interesting challenges with inner-city ,” he said, highlighting the high percentage of rentals, heritage considerations and architectural constraints.
“But considering that, we had a really good result. We rolled out the program in mid-2019 and in early 2020 we were well ahead of our benchmark. Obviously, things slowed a bit but there is certainly more interest now.”
Mercouriou said the program, a part of the city’s transition towards a 100% renewable future, had increased the penetration of solar in Yarra “by more than 4% in about eight months”.
The success of the Yarra Solar Program follows that of the statewide Solar Homes program, a 10-year initiative designed to provide cheaper, cleaner energy sourced through rebated solar PV, solar batteries and solar hot water.
Solar Victoria said more than 110,000 Victorians had accessed the Solar Homes program since its launch in August 2018 with the latest data from the program showing there are now 510,000 small-scale solar PV systems in Victoria – all together they generate almost a third of the state’s total residential electricity demand, with more than 15,000 households also having a solar battery.
The YEF is doing its bit to assist those in inner-city Melbourne access battery storage, partnering with CitiPower to create a community battery network in the Melbourne CBD and inner-city suburbs.
The aim is to create a network of batteries, or ‘solar sponges‘, located on the low-voltage electricity network across inner-Melbourne operated by CitiPower which services 332,000 customers. 
The project’s first phase is already underway with sites being identified, developing financial modelling and relationships with market service providers including energy retailers. The first of the batteries is expected to be deployed in late 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/12/viva-energy-and-hyzon-team-up-for-hydrogen-transport-solution/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 12, 2021",Viva Energy and Hyzon team up for hydrogen transport solution,"One of Australia’s largest energy companies, Viva Energy announced this week it has entered into a strategic alliance with Hyzon and would work with the United States hydrogen fuel-cell technology developer to deliver a complete turn-key hydrogen transport solution for Australia.
Viva Energy, which supplies approximately 25% of Australia’s liquid fuel requirements, has committed to invest US$4 million in Hyzon as part of its capital raising and listing on the NASDAQ stock exchange (via its merger with Decarbonisation Plus Acquisition Corporation), announced earlier this week.
Viva Energy CEO Scott Wyatt said the agreement with Hyzon supports Viva’s vision to transform its Geelong refinery into an energy hub which is able to support Australia’s energy evolution while also helping to underpin the future viability of the refinery.
“This alliance helps us accelerate our Geelong Energy Hub vision through the development of hydrogen for transport and working with our existing partners and customers in providing this solution,” he said.
“The Hyzon alliance fits closely with our intention to explore and develop future energy solutions at our Energy Hub, where we are looking at the possibility of generating solar-powered green hydrogen.
“The establishment of a hydrogen transport hub in Geelong, while only conceptual at this stage, could be an exciting demonstration of the types of projects we could pursue though the Energy Hub.”

Viva Energy is the exclusive supplier of the Shell brand and its products in Australia through a network of more than 1,290 service stations spread across the country.
“By working closely with Hyzon, which is experienced at developing vehicles for markets worldwide, we can develop an entire hydrogen transport solution – which can move us past the traditional roadblocks to establishing a hydrogen refuelling network, by getting hydrogen fuel cell vehicles on the road to provide the demand,” Wyatt said.
Hyzon CEO Craig Knight said Australia is a priority market for the company, which only last month signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Australia’s Pure Hydrogen to develop a chain of hydrogen refuelling stations across the nation.
That followed their agreement to supply mining giant Fortescue Metals Group with a fleet of hydrogen-fuelled buses to transport workers at the company’s Christmas Creek iron ore mine in Western Australia’s Pilbara region.

Hyzon said it already has more than 400 commercial vehicles on the road using its fuel-cell technology and expects to deliver about 5,000 fuel cell-powered trucks and buses by 2023 and is targeting annual capacity of about 40,000 fuel cell-electric vehicles by 2025.
“Hydrogen mobility for the Australian commercial vehicle sector holds enormous potential as fleets look to smoothly transition from fossil fuels to clean energy solutions that decarbonise their operations,” Knight said.
“Developing a hydrogen supply chain with strategic partners will be central to this transition.
“This is why we are delighted to be partnering with Viva Energy, one of Australia’s largest energy companies, to drive the hydrogen mobility sector forward, with a focus on establishing Victoria and Geelong in particular, as leading hydrogen transport hubs.”
Renewable hydrogen is expected to make a substantial contribution to Australia’s clean energy transition with Fortescue Metals chairman Andrew Forrest declaring the impact “could be nothing short of nation-building”.
“The green hydrogen market could generate revenues, at the very least, of $US12 trillion by 2050 — bigger than any industry we have now,” he said during his Boyer Lecture earlier this year.
“And Australia, with characteristic luck, is sitting on everything it needs to be the world leader, but only if it acts fast.”
Viva Energy’s announcement signals another blow for Australia’s oil refinery industry with half of the nation’s refineries shutting down in the past four months.

The Geelong refinery is one of the last two oil refineries left in the nation (with the other being Ampol’s refinery in Brisbane, Queensland).
ExxonMobil announced the closure of its Altona oil refinery in Melbourne earlier this month while BP announced in October it was closing its Kwinana oil refinery in Perth. Both companies declared the refineries were no longer economically viable and both are to be converted into fuel-import terminals. Ampol is said to be currently reviewing whether to keep its Brisbane refinery open or convert it into a fuel-import terminal too.
In the 1980s, Australia had 10 major refineries that met virtually all of our domestic demand for refined fuel. Today, more than 90% of Australia’s refined fuels are imported.
In 2019-20, Australia imported $22.4 billion worth of refined petroleum products.

Joint venture UPC/AC Renewables Australia (UPC Renewables and AC Energy) said in a statement that construction on the first stage of the project got underway at the end of 2020, with lead contractor, Spanish infrastructure development group Elecnor, having already commenced early works through its subsidiary Green Light Contractors, including substation and road design. 
The New England Solar Farm will eventually become a 720 MW Solar installation combined with a 400 MWh battery energy storage system on site. It is hoped this first stage of the enormous project will be connected to the National Energy Market (NEM) and producing clean solar energy by July 2022, with a tentative date near the end of 2023 for the entire project to be operational. 
Of the 400 MWh lithium-ion battery storage facility planned for the site, UPC/AC Renewables plans for the first 50 MWh, which is supported by the NSW Government’s $75 million Emerging Energy Program, to be operational by mid-2022 along with the first stage of solar installation. 
The largest hybrid solar and battery project in Australia, the New England Solar Farm’s two solar fields sit within the area of the recently announced New England Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), but the project was planned and had connection to transmission approved by TransGrid before the 8 GW REZ (the second to be set on a path to development by the NSW Government) was announced in July 2020. 

“It’s exciting to achieve financial close on a merchant basis for such a large project, which is the first of many such projects we have in Australia,” said UPC/AC Renewables Australia CEO Anton Rohner. “UPC/AC Renewables Australia views this project fitting into the NSW Government RoadMap and look forward to being engaged in this process to help lower electricity prices in NSW.” 
UPC Renewables Executive Chairman Brian Caffyn added that this is “a very large energy project even for Australia and we are proud to be associated with the New England Solar Farm and the local community and helping to transition NSW towards a clean, lower cost energy future.” 
In the not too distant future the New England Solar Farm expects to participate in the bidding process of the NSW Electricity Infrastructure RoadMap to secure a long-term energy services agreement.
Once completed, the New England Solar Farm will be capable of producing enough energy to power around 250,000 homes annually, a substantial supply of energy to the market and helping to fill the gap left by the imminent closure of the Liddell Power Station.

Singaporean clean power developer Sunseap has said it installed and connected seven rooftop solar systems with a total generation capacity of 23.2 MWp to the Vietnamese grid in just three months last year.
Having secured a feed-in tariff (FIT) under the FIT 2 regime, which ran from April to the end of December, Sunseap yesterday said it installed almost 60,000 panels plus 370 inverters on factory and warehouse rooftops in southern provinces including Ba Ria Vung Tau, Dong Nai, Binh Phoc and Binh Duong.
Sunseap CEO and co-founder Frank Phuan, in a press release issued by the company, said: “It was no mean feat installing and commissioning seven solar plants in Vietnam within three months, and in the face of the pandemic-related travel restrictions and supply disruptions. We hope this demonstrates to our partners and potential partners Sunseap’s strong end-to-end project development and management competencies and our ability to complete a project within a tight deadline.”
FIT
The arrays will supply power to state power company Vietnam Electricity under a 20-year power purchase agreement. As pv magazine reported in April, the FIT 2 program offered a solar rooftop payment of $0.0838/kWh.
The developer said it expects the systems to generate 40.4 GWh per year for the Vietnamese grid. Developers were last year critical of the time frames involved in qualifying for the new payments, with projects having to be commissioned this year to be eligible. However, Phuan said: “The Vietnamese government has been incredibly supportive of clean energy and we look forward to more opportunities to power the country’s economic growth in a sustainable manner.”
In a separate development, Bangkok-based developer Constant Energy said it had secured its first corporate power purchase agreement-driven installation at the end of December, for a 1 MWp system in Binh Duong province.
The array, which was jointly developed with Bach Khoa Solar Group subsidiary Solar Esco, will supply power to apparel manufacturer Leading Star Garment joint stock company.
Constant Energy yesterday announced it had closed the VND8.9 billion ($388,000) finance for the array with the Indovina Bank joint venture established by the state-owned Vietnam Bank for Industry and Trade and Taiwanese commercial lender Cathay United Bank.
