For a solar power system to be eligible for Australia’s solar rebate, it must use Australian Standards-compliant and approved solar panels and inverters. The lists of eligible equipment has for more than a decade been prepared and maintained by the Clean Energy Council (CEC) but following a 2022 review into the rooftop PV sector, the CER has commenced an application process that will open the door to potentially another body maintaining the lists.
The CER said interested organisations and individuals will need to demonstrate their capacity to maintain the integrity of the product listing scheme, including testing and verification processes for including solar panels and inverters on the approved list.
The CEC has previously indicated it will submit an application to retain the product listing role
The Commonwealth government agency said the application round for bodies interested in the product listing contract will last three months with applications to close on 29 September 2023.

The numbers are staggering. The International Energy Agency estimates a sixfold increase in demand for these minerals by 2040 to meet climate targets of well below 2℃ of warming. We could need 21.5 million tonnes for electric vehicles and battery storage alone.

Transitional minerals include metals such as lithium, cobalt, copper, graphite, magnesium and nickel. They also include rare earths like neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium.
Currently, mining provides almost our entire supply. The scale of demand for these minerals could result in almost 400 new mines by 2035.
We can design energy and transport systems to minimise mineral demand. Strategies include:
All these changes can reduce the need for new mines.
Recycling, for example, could reduce demand for mined materials. For lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles, estimated reductions are 25% for lithium, 35% for cobalt and nickel, and 55% for copper by 2040.
This recycled content will mainly come from waste batteries. However, large volumes of lithium-ion batteries won’t start reaching the end of their lives for at least a decade. Recycling will only have a significant impact from 2035.

If we are destined to continue mining for the minerals needed for the energy transition, how can this be done responsibly? And what exactly do we mean by responsible sourcing?
Responsible sourcing minimises the environmental, social and governance impacts and risks of mining. Key concerns include the use of child labour and forced labour, damage to the environment, impacts on Indigenous rights and cultural heritage, and corruption.
In 2011, the Australian government released guidance on sustainable mining. Historical and recent harmful impacts highlight the need for a fresh look at mining practices. In 2020, for example, Rio Tinto destroyed a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal heritage site in Juukan Gorge.
First Nations people worldwide are calling for free, prior and informed consent when mining and renewable energy developments are proposed for their land. This approach recognises the right to be consulted early in the process, informed of the impacts, and supported to take part in negotiation and making agreements. Most importantly, it includes the right to say no.
In many parts of Australia, Indigenous communities have been locked out of economic opportunities, despite mining generating enormous wealth on their Country.

How do we do things more responsibly? We need to ensure activities comply with a range of sustainability criteria. An agreed standard will mean we have information that enables us to compare the good and bad apples.
The problem is there isn’t a common approach to measuring, managing and reporting environmental, social and governance performance. Our recent research analysed the plethora of voluntary standards and certifications available to battery materials producers. No common global or Australian standard has been adopted.
Smaller mining companies also struggle with the administrative complexities of sustainability reporting and management criteria. An agreed common language for reporting and management is needed. Only then can traceability solutions, such as the Global Battery Alliance’s blockchain-enabled “battery passport”, produce trustworthy and comparable results.

Our research identified the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) as one of the more rigorous standards. Its credibility is built on how it is governed. This involves six stakeholder groups: mining companies, purchasers, NGOs, affected communities, labour organisations and the finance sector.
There are still questions to be answered. How do practices in Australia measure up to the standard? And how can regulatory reform help to steer mining operations in the right direction?
A focus on environmental, social and governance practices in the Australian Critical Minerals Strategy, released last week, is a welcome first step.
Issues that must be front and centre include:
 
As a leading mining nation, Australia is in a position to leverage its historical environmental leadership, show renewed responsibility and integrity, and lead by example. We can then help leave the planet in a shape that future generations will be proud to inherit.

The Waratah Super Battery (WSB), being built by BlackRock battery offshoot Akaysha Energy at the site of the decommissioned Munmorah coal-fired power station near Doyalson north of Sydney, is intended to unlock latent transfer capacity in the existing transmission system, help integrate renewable energy, and maintain grid reliability by acting as a ‘shock absorber’ during power surges.
Akaysha has been contracted to deliver a battery capable of providing a guaranteed continuous active power capacity of at least 700 MW and a guaranteed useable energy storage capacity of at least 1,400 MWh. The company plans to trade the additional 150 MW/280 MWh of capacity in the electricity market as well as potentially releasing it during off-peak times.
Charlie Reid, BlackRock’s co-head of climate infrastructure in the Asia Pacific region, said the battery will add greater reliability and resilience to the power grid and will help Australia achieve its renewable ambitions.
“We firmly believe battery storage is the critical technology of today, applied both on a small scale in homes and for large-scale battery platforms like the Waratah Super Battery,” he said.
The WSB, which will be the largest standby network battery in the Southern Hemisphere and one of the biggest in the world, has been identified as a priority project in the Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) Integrated System Plan, which maps the investment required to achieve the federal government’s targeted 82% renewables by 2030.
Construction of the WSB began in May and is targeted for completion before August 2025, when Origin Energy’s 2,880 MW coal-fired Eraring power station in the Hunter region is scheduled to close.
The closure of the Eraring plant is part of a quickening shutdown of coal-fired generation across the grid with 60% of capacity now projected to be withdrawn by 2030.
AEMO estimates that Australia’s current storage capacity will need to increase from less than 2 GW operational or committed today to 61 GW by 2050 to meet energy demands through a mixture of utility-scale batteries, hydro storage and virtual power plants.
CEFC Chief Executive Officer Ian Learmonth said the federal government-backed green bank’s investment in the WSB supports a secure grid powered by renewable energy and fit for a future, low-emissions economy.
“Long- and short-duration storage assets are critical to building an energy network fit for purpose in the 21st century, enabling Australia to capitalise on its abundant natural resources of wind and solar to decarbonise the grid,” he said.
“Battery storage underpins a future balanced grid, ensuring that more clean energy can reach more consumers and providing network stability as coal continues to exit the network earlier than predicted.”
BlackRock’s funding announcement for the Waratah Super Battery comes after the asset manager acquired Melbourne-based Akaysha last year and is part of its plan to develop other battery storage projects in NSW, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/29/nsw-firming-tender-reaches-almost-1-gw-with-federal-scheme-support/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PUMPED HYDRO,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 29, 2023",NSW firming tender reaches almost 1 GW with federal scheme support,"The Australian and New South Wales (NSW) governments have announced that the state’s existing plan to add a minimum 380 MW of firming capacity will be more than doubled through Commonwealth funding that will underwrite investment for an additional 550 MW of firmed capacity.
The partnership between NSW and the Commonwealth will boost the 380 MW of firmed capacity being sought in the NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap’s firming tender to 930 MW to fill the gap that will be created by the impending closure of Australia’s ageing coal-fired power plants.
NSW Energy Minster Penny Sharpe said bids representing more than 3.3 GW total capacity have already been submitted to the tender round, meaning there is still a significant amount of firmed renewable projects ready to be unlocked by the announcement and support the grid over the long-term.
“The large number of proponents wanting to invest in NSW is a clear indication that we can transform our energy system and that any risks around grid reliability can be resolved by accelerating the development of a clean, reliable, consumer-focused energy system,” she said.
AEMO Services, which is administering the tender process in its capacity as NSW Consumer Trustee, is assessing the project applications to form a short list for the NSW tender. Shortlisted bidders will be invited to submit a financial value bid with the successful projects expected to be announced by the end of September.
The funds for the additional 550 MW of firmed capacity will come from the Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS), a new Commonwealth revenue underwriting mechanism aimed at unlocking an estimated $10 billion (USD 6.6 billion) in private and public sector investment in new dispatchable storage and generation.
Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen, said the initiative will increase crucial investment in dispatchable renewable energy to improve the security and reliability of the grid as coal-fired power plants exit the energy market.
“Today’s announcement will drastically improve energy security with large-scale batteries and other zero-emission technology that can quickly dispatch cleaner, cheaper renewable energy when it’s needed,” he said, adding that a decade of “energy policy chaos” had resulted in 4 GW of dispatchable power generation capacity exiting the east coast grid, with only 1 GW to replace it, “leaving us extremely vulnerable to international shocks.”
Bowen said when expanded across the other states in the National Electricity Market, the CIS is expected to support the addition of 6 GW of firmed capacity.
The launch of the capacity scheme in NSW will be followed by similar auctions of firming capacity in South Australia and Victoria with those tenders expected to be announced by October.

Researchers from City University of Hong Kong have proposed blockchain-based solar passports as an effective solution to monetise solar PV plant assets in India. It says that such material passports could fill in the data gap during the entire life cycle of PV modules.
The framework would allow verification of the origin, quality, and quantity of materials used in PV panels, thereby boosting recycling investors’ confidence and facilitating the secondary market for PV assets.  The researchers, Nallapaneni Manoj Kumar and Shauhrat S. Chopra, highlight the urgent need for integration of the proposed framework into existing or new policies and regulations in India. 
The researchers project India’s PV waste potential at 1.95 megatons resulting from the grid-connected solar PV facilities installed in the nation before January 31, 2019. The researchers modelled material recovery under three recycling techniques, namely, the standard industrial procedure as the baseline scenario, the thermochemical demanufacturing procedure, and the delamination procedure.
In the baseline scenario, the PV waste is directly subjected to shredding without removing a PV panel’s rear-side junction box. The shredded PV panels are then processed using metallurgical and induction sorting methods to recover materials. 
In contrast, in the thermal and chemical scenario, the end-of-life (EoL) PV panels are treated differently, where the junction boxes at the rear side of the PV module and cables are separated first. Thereafter, the remaining PV waste is subjected to thermal treatment followed by chemical treatment to recover materials. 
Similarly, in the delamination scenario, the junction boxes and cables are manually removed from EoL PV panels. The glass component is then isolated from solar cells during the cutting step of the recycling process, and thermal approaches are applied to recover useful materials from the residual waste.
The analysis indicates that the front glass of the PV module, which constitutes approximately 59.51% of its weight, is the most prevalent component for material recovery. Specifically, for every 1 tonne of PV waste, 595 kg of glass can be recovered, with the potential to recover around 89.6% to 98% of the glass under different recycling scenarios.
