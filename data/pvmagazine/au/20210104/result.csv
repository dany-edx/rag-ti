Although much of the affected population was in Christmas recovery at the time, PV technology consultant Pierre Verlinden, a former VP and Chief Scientist at Trina Solar in China, but now based back in South Australia’s McLaren Vale, posted the moment on LinkedIn and began answering questions from the worldwide clean-energy-interested community.

He noted that South Australia has seen a steady increase in the penetration of renewables over the past 13 years, with an absolute increase of 4.5% per annum, leading to an average contribution of renewable generation over 2020 of 59%.
Therefore, he extrapolated, “I would expect 63.5% in 2021 and 100% by 2030.” 
AEMO’s South Australian Electricity Report for the financial year 2019/2020, released in November, attributed 42.9% of the 59.6% renewable penetration in South Australia to wind generation, and 15.7% to solar generation (11.6% rooftop).
As Verlinden says, “The keys to 100% renewables is a good combination of diversity of sources, storage and interconnection of the network.”
So although the renewable contribution in the state so far is stellar by world standards — and for an hour on October 11 solar generation actually supplied 100% of South Australia’s electricity — diversification of renewable sources and stronger interconnection with the rest of the National Electricity Market are necessary further developments on the road to continuous 100% generation.
“The good characteristics of South Australia are that there is very good decoupling of wind and solar PV,” wrote Verlinden on LinkedIn, who contrasted the resources with those of California, “where wind energy is very much synchronous with solar”.
Nonetheless, rampaging solar generation, which the South Australian Electricity Report documented as increasing by 35% from the financial year 2018/19, has caused daytime meltdowns when supply outstrips demand, such that the state government saw it necessary to rush in regulations to allow centralised disconnection of rooftop supply to support grid stability.
Ultimately, the flexible autonomous control by inverters of rooftop-solar exports to the grid will allow a more balanced supply-demand scenario, and an ARENA-funded trial is currently underway — involving SA Power Networks, SwitchDin smart software solutions and Fronius, SMA and SolarEdge inverter manufacturers — to test and and hopefully scale such a system, which would enable continued connection of rooftop solar systems sized to suit the householder, not the limitations of the network.
Verlinden also refers to the stabilising influence of batteries: notably South Australia’s 150 MW Hornsdale Power Reserve, which since its first 100 MW stage was connected to the grid in 2017, has responded to major system outages and helped the network surf variability in renewable supply.
Residential and commercial batteries, especially when linked to smart energy-flow controllers capable of responding to grid signals, will also help smooth network supply and demand.
“Currently,” notes Verlinden, “the state is using a minimum of 200 MW of continuous gas-powered source to maintain the grid voltage, and a back of ~1,500 MW of gas-powered generators.”
Interestingly, South Australia’s existing connection to the long arm of the NEM has facilitated exports to other states equal to 2.8% of generation, so the state actually generated renewable energy equal to 61.3% of its consumption.
On the subject of interconnection, 2020 saw Project EnergyConnect, a long-planned 875-kilometre transmission line between South Australia and New South Wales, clear another regulatory hurdle in the required several-year process to delivery.
Should the $2.5 billion project go ahead, and not be overtaken by a conga line of batteries delivering virtual transmission, or pipelines of renewable hydrogen — it is taking so long that such eventualities are not totally in the realm of the ridiculous — it will enable still greater resilience to South Australia’s variable renewable generation allowing supply and demand to be distributed across different geographic regions, and a wider range of renewable generation and storage projects including Snowy 2.0.
At the start of this new year, South Australia, says Verlinden, still has a “very weak” interconnection with other states and no renewable-energy sources besides prodigious wind and growing solar (that’s discounting a 3 MW dribble of hydroelectric capacity provided by SA Water’s Terminal Storage Mini Hydro system at Tea Tree Gully).
In short, he writes, “the transformation of the energy economy is far from finished”.

This year Canopy Power, operating as engineering, procurement and construction partner to Total Solar Distributed Generation, will construct a new solar-based power plant on Koh Rong Samloem, which lies just off the coast of Sihanoukville, and where some 60 hotels, resorts and guest houses currently each rely on their own diesel generators.
The plant will be owned and operated by Total Solar DG, a subsidiary of French energy giant Total, and provide renewably generated electricity to a licensed local electricity retailer.
Designed as two microgrids incorporating 1.25 MWp of ground-mounted solar, and 2 MWh of battery storage integrated with diesel generators and smart controllers, the project will provide more than 50% of the island’s needs from renewable energy, displacing around 600,000 litres of diesel per annum.

“Converting an entire island from diesel to solar-battery power in what is the largest project of its kind, is a milestone in our regional portfolio of over 600 MW of projects in operation and development,” said Gavin Adda, CEO of Total Solar DG, when the project was announced in November 2020.
After minor delays, work on electrification of Koh Rong Samloem began in late 2020 and completion is expected in the second quarter of 2021.
The island’s population of around 300 sustains itself with fishing, tourism and small-scale crop cultivation, and is largely concentrated in the two villages of M’Pai Bay in the north and Koh Rong Sanloem Phumi Kang Khnong in the south.
The villages will now be connected by a new medium-voltage distribution system constructed as part of the project.
Tourist reviews of the island cite its natural beauty, fantastic snorkelling, jungle walks to historic sites and unreliable, in some areas non-existent, power supply. 
The Canopy Power-Total Generation DG project will deliver 24-hour electricity security, and substantially reduce noise and air pollution caused by diesel generators.
The Koh Rong Samloem electrification project, says Adda, “is an example of remote locations leveraging renewables to improve access to power and also cut costs”.
While Total Solar DG sees the opportunity to decarbonise and ensure the electricity supply of “tens of thousands of islands” in Southeast Asia, says Adda, other innovators, such as Australia’s BlueVolt are similarly working to free the Pacific Islands from the tyranny of reliance on diesel generation.
The Savo Solar Initiative, funded by the Honnold Foundation, is trialling a solar-plus-battery system designed by BlueVolt, at Sunset Lodge on the isle of Savo in the Solomon Islands, with the dual aims of enabling the island to become self sufficient in managing its natural energy resource, and provide the reliability of power that will allow islanders to build a tourism industry based around a sustainable, clean, quiet electricity supply.
Although some renewable-energy projects on remote islands have slowed or stalled during 2020 in the interests of keeping populations isolated from the Covid-19 pandemic, Sujay Malve, founder and CEO of Canopy Power says the renewable industry is “experiencing a surge in awareness within individuals and corporations towards sustainability”.
He says Canopy Power’s focus in 2021 will be “on expanding our geographical reach and providing novel technical and financial solutions to increase the uptake of renewable energy microgrids in Southeast Asia”.
If such ambitions can be accelerated, future travellers are likely to encounter improved living standards among island communities, and a more tranquil environment consistent with their dreams of an island holiday.

“According to the data available on Australia National Electricity Market Dashboard, Google Data Studio,” the company said in a release, JinkoSolar modules deployed in large-scale solar projects are currently generating “almost 550 MWac” of a combined 1.5 GW solar-only (not including hybrid plants) output.
“We are very proud,” said Anita Li, General Manager of JinkoSolar for the Asia Pacific region. “This achievement validates our efforts and the customer recognition from the market means a lot to us.”
One of the world’s biggest solar module manufacturers, JinkoSolar Australia last year signed a one year $37 million line-of-credit agreement with National Australia Bank (NAB), to enable expansion of its local business and supplement its working capital.
“Our teams have been actively seeking new opportunities to contribute to the local electrical power system,” Li said in late December.
The 20 MW Royalla Solar Farm on the outskirts of Canberra was one of JinkoSolar’s first Australian projects, developed and commissioned by Fotowatio Renewable Ventures in 2014.
In the first half of 2019, 390,000 JinkoSolar Cheetah 290-300Wp 120 half-cell monocrystalline panels were commissioned at the 95 MW Tailem Bend Solar Farm, in what was only the second utility-scale solar project in South Australia.

And recently, the company supplied one of Australia’s largest solar projects to date, the 255 MW Sunraysia Solar Farm, which has some 750,000 solar modules installed across 10 square kilometres of south-west New South Wales.
Sunraysia suffered long delays in commissioning, due in large part to gridlock caused by a mass of solar projects seeking to connect to the National Electricity Market in that transmission-challenged region. The hold ups inflicted substantial losses on UK-based infrastructure developer and majority owner of Sunraysia, John Laing, but the project is now partially generating — its website shows it to be 39% energised — with full output expected to be achieved this year.
Other projects rolling off JinkoSolar’s high-tech production lines (which were forecast to have a module output capacity of 24 GW by end 2020), include the 140 MW Glenrowan West Solar Farm outside Wangaratta in Victoria; the 50 MW Jemalong Solar Farm, near Forbes in NSW; and Eni Australia’s 12.5 MW Batchelor Solar Farm in the Northern Territory.
Having signed up in 2019 to the Climate Group’s RE100 initiative (leading companies committed to running their operations 100% on renewable energy) and EP100 initiative (companies committed to producing more with less energy), JinkoSolar last year released its own “roadmap” to becoming 100% renewable powered by 2025.
The roadmap included accelerating R&D into new and recycled, lighter material alternatives in its product designs; optimising production processes to save energy; and investing more in onsite solar generation and battery energy storage at its nine globally dispersed manufacturing facilities.
As part of JinkoSolar’s overall strategy, Li said the company would “continue to provide innovative technology-based products and optimised operation to push the development of renewable development in Australia”.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/04/looking-into-the-cracks/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JANUARY 4, 2021",Looking into the cracks,"From pv magazine global
Cell cracking has emerged in recent years as a threat to module performance in the field. In certain projects, cracks have been shown to cause as much as 9% performance loss – more than enough to hurt profitability.
Cracking is the result of excessive thermal or mechanical stress being placed on a module, and can occur during manufacturing, transport, handling and even after deployment. The fact that cracks often start out too small for most testing to detect, and grow over time to reduce module performance, complicates the picture even further.
Module reliability experts PV Evolution Labs (PVEL) put more than 40 modules representing the bulk of commercially available technologies through rigorous stress testing, to better understand the likelihood of cracks occurring and affecting performance in the field.
Some of their observations from this testing are published in a new white paper. The paper  concludes that each module will behave differently, and testing a specific bill of materials (BOM) is the only way to be sure of its susceptibility. However, PVEL’s testing also draws reveals some interesting trends in terms of new technologies and the risk of cracking.
Strong performers
The white paper finds that certain recent technology trends serve to reduce the risk associated with cracking – monocrystalline cells, now representing more than 80% of the market, are less susceptible, and recently introduced multibusbar interconnection reduces the chance of a crack creating an inactive area on the module.
Interdigitated back contact modules, glass-glass and thin film technologies all showed little to no cracking after going through PVEL’s mechanical stress testing. Half-cut cell technology is also shown to reduce the risk of cracking by more evenly distributing pressure over smaller surfaces, provided the formation of microcracks is avoided in cell cutting.
New risks
Another trend revealed in the testing is that larger module surface areas tend to equal more cracks – a highly relevant finding given the switch to larger formats that continues to play out in module manufacturing.
PVEL warns that larger surface areas, both in wafer and module, can mean more deflection during high loads, and more risk of cracking. High density interconnection techniques, reducing the gap between cells, could also increase the amount of mechanical stress placed on individual cells. The white paper offers an example where two modules of 120 and 144 cells, otherwise with the same BOM, were tested, and the 144 cell version showed significantly more cracking.
They also note that storms, changes in temperature and other weather conditions can cause cracking in the field, and the increased frequency of extreme weather events in many regions presents further of risk of cracking, alongside other damage to modules in the field.
“Crack susceptibility is nuanced,“ the PVEL experts conclude. “Several new technologies are inherently less susceptible to cracking, but some older technologies may perform better than their newer counterparts. Crack susceptibility ultimately depends on the specific components and manufacturing techniques employed in PV module production.” And the lab plans to continue testing, with close to 100 new BOM’s lined up for next year.

Global energy storage provider Fluence said it will receive US$125 million from the Qatar Investment Authority through a private placement transaction.
Net proceeds will be used to further develop the company’s product offerings, particularly digital products, and deployment of existing products in more markets around the world.
AES and Siemens will remain major shareholders, each maintaining a roughly 44% stake, and will continue to support Fluence’s long-term growth. The company currently has around 2.4 GW of projects deployed or awarded across 24 countries and territories worldwide.
Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) is the sovereign wealth fund of the State of Qatar. It was founded in 2005 to invest and manage the state reserve funds. QIA ranks among the largest and most active sovereign wealth funds globally.
Manuel Perez Dubuc, Fluence’s CEO, said in a statement the company sees energy storage as the “linchpin of a decarbonized grid” and that adding QIA to its shareholder base “will allow Fluence to innovate even faster and address the enormous global market” for large-scale battery-based energy storage.
In the U.S., developers are on track to deploy a record 1.2 GW of storage in 2020, according to Wood MacKenzie. Deployments are projected to increase over the next five years, rising to nearly 7.5 GW in 2025. In California alone, Fluence has around 1 GW of storage capacity expected to come online in the coming months.
Qatar Investment Authority is one of six founding members of the One Planet Sovereign Wealth Fund Initiative, which is building climate change into financial decision making. The proposed investment in Fluence is expected to enhance QIA’s growing focus on green technology development.
This past summer, Fluence announced its sixth-generation Tech Stack, which is designed to enable faster deployment of standardized, modular systems; reduce balance of system costs; and provide customizable approaches for customers.
At the time, Fluence said the new technology had been specified by Enel, LS Power, sPower and Siemens for 800 MW, 2,300 MWh, of projects.
In October, Fluence acquired AMS’ software and digital intelligence platform for renewables and energy storage. The platform is designed to improve revenue of energy storage assets in wholesale markets.
AMS’ technology uses artificial intelligence, advanced price forecasting, portfolio optimization and market bidding to ensure energy storage and flexible generation assets are responding optimally to price signals sent by the market.
