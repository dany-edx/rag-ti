The company is commercialising a “miscibility gap alloy” approach to thermal energy storage, storing heat in blocks made largely from aluminium and graphite and dispatching it to generate electricity.
MGA’s patented thermal energy storage blocks, about the size of a large house brick, consist of small alloy particles embedded within graphite-based blocks enclosed in a fully insulated system. Once heated the alloy particles can store heat for days with minimal energy loss. Heat exchangers are used a transfer gas to absorb heat from the blocks, with the heated gas or fluid suitable for industrial heat applications or to drive a steam turbine to generate electricity.
The technology has the potential to be a cost-effective, medium-duration storage technology due to its high energy density, low energy degradation, modular design and low cost.
Shell’s money, provided through its “GameChanger” seed funding division, will assist with the creation of the demonstration plant being built at MGA’s new commercial manufacturing facility at Tomago, near Newcastle, in the NSW Hunter region.

The pilot unit will measure about 12m x 3m x 4m and be fitted with approximately 3,700 MGA blocks. The unit has a planned storage capacity of 5 MWh, with charging and discharging at up to 500 kW for 10 hours.
MGA Chief Operating Officer Mark Croudace said the project, which is expected to come online in 2023, will produce valuable performance data and “provide a tangible demonstration of the technology for prospective industrial and power customers.”
“Our technology is attractive for those looking to decarbonise, with a high potential impact in the medium- to long-duration energy storage sector,” he said.
“Shell’s funding, in conjunction with ARENA [Australian Renewable Energy Agency], allows us to accelerate our pilot, going live in 2023, gather additional data about our technology, and continue our rapid growth into commercial industrial and power markets.”
Data gathered will cover the charging and discharging behaviour, fluid dynamics and temperature distributions, and validate the efficacy of the MGA technology under a variety of end-use case simulations, including providing dispatchable power, process heat, and green hydrogen production.
Shell GameChanger representative Matt McDonald said MGA had been selected from a pool of dozens of quality applicants who responded to a call for long-duration energy storage solutions.
“We look forward to seeing their progress and to continue lending Shell support and expertise,” he said.
Shell is just the latest to back MGA’s technology with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency providing $1.27 million to help finance the pilot unit.
Australia’s largest electricity generator AGL Energy has also shown an interest, linking with MGA to investigate the technical and financial feasibility of using thermal batteries to provide the steam for a 200 MW turbine at the Torrens Island Power Plant in South Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/20/victoria-gives-tick-of-approval-to-accelerate-intra-state-transmission-project/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 20, 2023",Victoria approves acceleration of intra-state transmission project,"The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has been cleared to start early works on the Victoria-New South Wales Interconnector (VNI) West project which has the potential to boost Victoria’s import and export capacities with New South Wales (NSW) by more than 1.8 GW.
An order has been issued under the National Electricity (Victoria) Act that enables the market operator to immediately commence preparatory and planning works for the estimated $3.25 billion (USD 2.25 billion) project which comprises a new high-capacity 500 kV double-circuit overhead transmission line linking Victoria and NSW.
The Victorian government said the order will speed up key development activities including stakeholder and community engagement, land use planning, detailed engineering design, and cost estimation.
Processes such as the Environment Effects Statement (EES) will be able to start later in 2023, a year earlier than originally anticipated.
The VNI West project, which is expected to be built by 2028, has been identified as a key piece of network infrastructure in AEMO’s Integrated System Plan for the increased integration of renewables and maintaining reliability as increasing numbers of coal-fired power plants exit the system.

The project proposes to connect Victoria’s grid north of Ballarat, via Kerang, with NSW at the Dinawan substation near Wagga Wagga. It is anticipated the interconnector will result in an extra 1,800 MW of transfer capacity during peak demand periods, allowing Victoria to export about 1,930 MW to NSW.
Victoria Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said transmission projects like VNI West are the key to delivering cheaper and more reliable renewable and storage capacity as Victoria continues its transition towards renewable energy.
“As ageing coal-fired generators retire and become increasingly unreliable, Victoria is enabling a once-in-a-generation transformation of our clean energy grid and delivering thousands of jobs along the way,” she said.
“Bringing forward VNI West means we can connect cheaper, more reliable renewable energy sooner, putting downward pressure on energy prices.”
It is expected the transmission project will unlock between 1.9 GW and 5 GW of new renewable projects in Victorian renewable energy zones (REZs), provide an additional market for the state’s offshore wind industry and provide access to NSW projects like Snowy 2.0.
AEMO Victorian Planning Group Manager Nicola Falcon said the project will improve the reliability and security of electricity supply for both states.
“VNI West will help unlock and share geographically and technologically diverse clean, low-cost renewables, including from renewable energy zones in Victoria and NSW,” she said.
“Allowing more renewables into the power system and utilising better access to deep storage from Snowy 2.0 will reduce carbon emissions and improve the reliability and security of electricity supply as ageing coal power stations close.”

The ESC would be seeded with a $1 billion investment from the existing Restart NSW Fund, which was established in 2011 and uses money from the privatisation of public assets to reinvest in state infrastructure.
NSW Labor said the role of the ESC – announced less than three months after Victorian Labor leader Daniel Andrews announced a plan to revive state ownership of energy assets with the State Electricity Commission – will be to partner with private-sector parties to develop renewable projects that provide “affordable, accessible and reliable” energy to the state.
This would include medium- to long-duration renewable storage solutions such as pumped hydro, as well as community batteries to maximise the benefits of rooftop solar and any other commercially viable technologies to provide grid stability.
NSW Labor Leader Chris Minns said these areas are critical to managing the transformation of NSW’s energy system and providing the reliability the state needs but said the private sector has made it clear it is difficult to invest in these areas alone.
Minns said industry is driving investment in cheaper, cleaner generation from wind and solar but not enough has been done to ensure the dispatchable supply of clean energy needed “when the sun doesn’t shine or the wind doesn’t blow.”

“For 12 years, our electricity network has been sold off to the highest bidder without adequate investment in renewable energy,” he said.
“Labor’s Fresh Start Plan will stop any further privatisation of our energy assets. We will create the NSW Energy Security Corporation, a state-owned body that will accelerate investment in renewable energy assets to deliver cleaner and more reliable energy and help keep the lights on.”
Labor said the ESC will result in an overall expansion of the private sector renewable energy investment in NSW similar to the way the Commonwealth’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) has expanded total renewable energy investment across Australia.
“It won’t just create a more reliable grid. It will also invest in clean energy of the future, securing our energy market,” Minns said. “This is not a Band-Aid solution.”
The incumbent NSW government also promised to create a $1.5 billion Clean Energy Superpower Fund to fast-track energy projects, including energy grid security projects and community battery projects – if it is re-elected.
The superpower fund would combine the government’s existing $1.2 billion Transmission Acceleration Facility with an additional $300 million for renewable energy storage and grid security projects, such as pumped hydro and batteries.
The Coalition also plans to invest a further $23 million to expand its Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap to cover rooftop solar and small-scale batteries and to unblock local grid constraints to allow more people to produce and share energy locally.

NSW Energy Minister Matt Kean said there are currently 813,000 rooftop solar systems installed across the state, with this figure projected to grow to 1.5 million by 2030.
“Rooftop solar is a no-brainer to save money on energy bills but we know that tens of thousands of families can’t get the full benefit of their system because of network constraints which limit the amount of energy they can export to the grid,” he said.
“The Clean Energy Superpower Fund will bust through these constraints, helping to roll out the storage and network infrastructure that the grid needs to unlock the renewable energy of the future.”
Labor’s announcement was welcomed by the clean energy industry’s peak body, the Clean Energy Council (CEC), saying the initiative appears to have “struck the right balance … to ensure the state remains a beneficiary for private investors.”
CEC Chief Executive Officer Kane Thornton said the NSW government has helped the state become a “leading light in Australia’s clean energy transformation.”
“This, in turn, has made NSW an attractive location for private investors in renewable energy,” he said. “We would expect that by targeting areas of reliability, affordability and medium- to long-term storage, the public-sector contributions by the NSW Energy Security Corporation will help lower power prices, create jobs, keep the lights on and reduce our emissions.”
Thornton said the “global clean energy arms race” is intensifying and Australia needs to “boldly assert ourselves to secure a share of the massive green growth opportunity.”
“If we don’t act quickly, Australia risks missing out on the early mover advantages,” he said. “To that end, all investment – whether public or private – in Australia’s renewable energy sector is a welcome contribution.”

The agreement sees Samsung take a stake of undisclosed size for an undisclosed sum in the solar-powered green hydrogen project being developed by IGE near Northam about 100 kilometres east of Perth in WA’s Wheatbelt region.
The MEG HP1 project will build on the existing 11 MW Northam Solar Farm, with the addition of a 10 MW hydrogen electrolyser and battery energy storage.
Once fully operational, the facility is expected to produce up to four tonnes of renewable hydrogen a day for medium and heavy-duty transport use by early 2024. IGE said the scope is there to expand the solar facility to 18 MW, potentially doubling the site’s production capacity to 8 tonnes of green hydrogen daily.
Samsung Vice President Andrew Ahn said participation in the project aligns strongly with the values and vision of the South Korean company which is seeking to grow its renewable energy portfolio globally.
“We are committed to fast tracking the energy transition, creating opportunities for people and businesses,” he said. “Production of green hydrogen is a key component of that story.”

IGE Chief Executive Officer Stephen Gauld said the partnership with Samsung brings “so much credibility to our company, shareholders, strategic partners, and buyers of our future fuel.”
“Samsung already committed resources from its headquarters in South Korea, Dubai and Australia to deliver this project and resources are now working in the IGE office here in Perth,” he said.
Gauld said the front-end engineering and design (FEED) has been completed for the project and a final investment decision is expected to be made later in 2023 with IGE planning to submit the development approval in “the next few weeks.”
The MEG HP1 project appears to be a warm-up of sorts for IGE which is also progressing plans to develop its Arrowsmith hydrogen plant, which it says will produce up to 25 tonnes of green hydrogen daily.
To be developed near the town of Dongara, about 320 km north of Perth, IGE says the first stage of the project would incorporate 65 MW of solar and 90 MW of wind to produce an initial 23 tonnes of green hydrogen a day from 2025.
Arrowsmith also has expansion options to deliver 5 GW of renewable energy and more than 300 tonnes of green hydrogen per day.

Ongoing supply chain disruptions, shifting renewable energy procurement goals, and a global energy crisis took hold in 2022. This year, some of these trends are evolving to a new stage in the energy transition, says S&P Global.
After two years of feeling the effects of tightened supply chains, raw materials and shipping costs are declining in 2023. Global shipping costs have lowered to pre-pandemic levels. However, S&P Global says this cost relief won’t immediately translate to lower coverall capital expenditures for renewable energy projects. 
S&P Global says land access and grid connections are proving to be the biggest bottleneck for the industry. This is leading to an unintended consequence of driving up development costs, as investors rush to deploy capital in markets where interconnection availability is insufficient, and investors are willing to pay premiums for faster, construction-ready projects. 
Another change pushing prices upward is the shortage of skilled workers, causing a rise in construction labor costs. This, along with a rising cost of capital, will likely prevent any noticeable price declines in project capex in the near term, says S&P Global. 
PV module prices have fallen faster than expected in early 2023, as polysilicon supply becomes more abundant. This relief will likely trickle down to module prices, though it is expected to be offset by manufacturers looking to recover margins. 
Further down the value chain, installers and distributors are expected to increase their margins. S&P says this will likely lead to less cost relief benefits to rooftop solar end-users, while utility-scale developers will benefit from lowered costs more. S&P projects utility-scale demand to intensify globally, particularly in cost-sensitive emerging markets. 
In 2022, distributed solar consolidated its position as a mainstream electricity supply option in many established markets. In 2023, S&P Global expects the technology to spread to new consumer segments and gain ground in new markets. New types of households and small businesses will gain access as shared solar options become available, and PV systems are expected to increasingly be attached with energy storage. 
Among households, upfront cash payments remain the most common investment option, though electricity distributors continue to push for a more diversified landscape that includes rental, lease, and power purchase agreement contracts. These financing models are expected to spread beyond the United States, where they have been deployed extensively over the past decade. 
As liquidity becomes a major concern for many businesses, commercial and industrial customers are expected to increasingly adopt third-party financing as well. For the providers of third-party financed PV systems, the challenge is to secure contracts with credit-worthy offtakers, says S&P Global. 
The overall policy landscape is expected to favour more distributed generation, either through cash grants, value-added tax reductions, tax rebates, or feed-in tariffs. 
Supply chain challenges and national security concerns have led to an increased focus on local manufacturing of solar and energy storage, particularly in the United States and Europe. An emphasis on reducing reliance on imported gas has caused renewable energy to become the centre of energy supply strategies. 
New policy like the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States and REPowerEU in Europe are drawing in large investment in new manufacturing capacity. It will also lead to a boost in deployment. S&P Global expects a 2023 global buildout of close to 500 GW of wind, solar, and battery energy storage, over 20% more than the amount installed in 2022. 
“However, concerns persist over Chinese dominance of the manufacturing of the equipment – particularly for solar and batteries – and the various risks involved in being over-dependent on a single region to supply the required goods,” says S&P Global.

TW Solar (Tongwei) has unveiled new shingled solar panels for rooftop applications.
“The Tongwei Terra shingled panel adopts Thermal Laser Separation (TLS) technology through which the whole cell is cut into several cell strips and interconnected using conductive adhesive to achieve flexible connection,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “This can optimise the solar panel structure and achieves zero cell spacing, which effectively increases the light-receiving area of the panel.”
Shingled panels feature a busbar-free structure in which only a small proportion of cells are not exposed to sunlight. The cells are bonded to form a shingled high-density string and the resulting strips are connected through a conductive adhesive. The reduced number of busbars reduces shadowing losses.
The monofacial monocrystalline panel is available in six versions with power outputs ranging from 400 W to 430 W and a power conversion efficiency between 20.1% and 21.7%. The open-circuit voltage is between 41.2 V and 41.8 V and the short-circuit current is between 12.41 A and 13.05 A.
The modules measure 1,812 mm x 1,096 mm x 30 mm and weigh in at 20.8 kg. They are fabricated with 3.2 mm tempered glass, an anodized aluminum frame, and a junction box with an IP 68 rating.
The new product can operate with a system voltage of 1,500 V and temperatures ranging between -40 C and 85 C. It features a temperature coefficient of -0.34% per degree Celsius. The manufacturer offers a 25-year product warranty and a 25-year power output guarantee for 84.80% of the initial yield.
“Tongwei Terra meets the needs of European customers in many ways and is popular in the high-end market of Europe,” claimed the Chinese PV manufacturer. “The shingled panels are all designed from the perspective of architecture. With architectural aesthetic characteristics, they fully meet the buildings’ waterproof, windproof, fireproof, wind, and snow-resistant features and provide extra eco-friendly attributes to the buildings.”
