The confirmation came just hours before the Sydney-based renewable energy developer revealed it had achieved record revenue last financial year totalling more than $26 million.
Skip Capital, an investment firm founded by Farquhar and his wife, former Hastings Funds Management executive Kim Jackson, and Stonepeak have placed a 23 cent per share bid for Genex, representing a total valuation of more than $300 million.
“The Genex board has not yet formed a view on the merits of the indicative proposal or any potential further engagement with the consortium,” Genex said in a statement issued on Monday.
Genex confirmed that Skip Capital, through its Skip Essential Infrastructure Fund, has already built up a 19.99% stake in the renewable energy company after a series of transactions completed last week.
Genex’s portfolio of renewable energy generation and storage projects includes the $777 million Kidston Pumped Hydro Storage Project being developed about 270 kilometres north-west of Townsville in northern Queensland.

The 250 MW / 2,000 MWh pumped hydro facility is the centrepiece of what will become the Kidston Clean Energy Hub, which comprises the existing 50 MW Kidston Solar Farm, which Genex has been operating since 2017, while up to 270 MW of additional solar and up to 150 MW of wind generation have also been proposed.
Genex is also building the 50 MW/100 MWh Bouldercombe Battery Project in Queensland and operates the 50 MW Jemalong Solar Farm in New South Wales.
The takeover interest comes with Genex announcing on Monday that it had achieved record revenue last financial year and the first full year of positive operating cash flow in the company’s history.
In its latest quarterly report, Genex reveals that its two operating solar farms had brought in $26.1 million of revenue (unaudited) over financial year 2022 while its net operating cash flow reached $4 million.
“The value of our existing portfolio of renewable energy assets was highlighted during the period with both the Kidston Stage 1 Solar Farm and the Jemalong Solar Farm able to take advantage of the recent uplift in wholesale electricity prices, to secure record revenue and cash flow for the business,” Genex chief executive officer James Harding said.

Barr said the battery project would help “future proof” the territory’s energy supply by reducing the load on Canberra’s electricity network and increasing network reliability. The project is also expected to facilitate the increased installation of rooftop and commercial solar PV across the ACT, allowing more households to enjoy the financial benefits of solar power.
“After delivering 100% renewable electricity, battery storage if the next step to protect the ACT when fossil fuel generators fail during hot summers,” Barr said. “ACT Labor recognises that low-cost energy storage is the missing link in the transition to a 100% renewable National Electricity Market.”
The battery project is to be delivered in three streams. Stream one will deliver 250 MW of grid-connected battery storage to support the electricity network. Stream two will initially seek to deliver batteries, up to 1 MW, at 14 government sites to help reduce power used in government buildings and reduce the strain on the distribution network. Stream three will see the deployment of a still to be specified number of medium-sized neighbourhood batteries at sites around the city.
Barr said the battery ecosystem could potentially power over one-third of the ACT.

“(The) Big Canberra Battery will involve a distributed network of batteries that will be built around the city,” he said. “The largest batteries will be used to support our electricity network. Smaller batteries would be used to power essential services such as schools and hospitals. In between, neighbourhood-scale batteries will provide opportunities for local communities to participate in the energy revolution.
“As a combined network, this battery system can address network constraints, enable more Canberrans to have solar and shorten the pay-off period of domestic solar systems.”
Procurement processes for streams one and two are currently being developed and will open to industry in August 2022. The latest announcement comes after a call for expressions of interest from companies for the large-scale batteries closed in February 2022.
Construction of the batteries is expected to commence from 2023 with the project to be complete in 2023-24.
The Big Canberra Battery project is in addition to the more than 100 MW of battery projects being developed in the ACT by French renewables giant Neoen and Australian developer Global Power Generation.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/25/jinkosolar-unveils-battery-system-for-australian-residential-market/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 25, 2022",JinkoSolar unveils battery system for Australian residential market,"JinkoSolar has launched its modular SunTank home battery system in Australia, a lithium-iron phosphate storage solution which is sized for day-to-day use in residential settings and is primarily designed to be paired with a solar panel system.
JinkoSolar says the battery energy storage system is scalable from 2.56 kWh to 25.6 kWh with a single-phase hybrid inverter and can provide 5.1 kW power output. Each individual module measures 650mm x 260mm x 185mm and weighs in at 28kg. With an IP65 rating the Suntank has an operating temperature ranging from -10°C to +50°C.
The company said the product, which is backed by a 10-year product warranty, has been designed to ensure fast and flexible deployment and is suitable for both wall and floor installation.
JinkoSolar said the Suntank system offers both AC and DC-coupling methods to realise multi-directional energy interaction between PV modules, batteries, and the grid, and can provide power back-up in the case of grid outages.
“Due to the instability of the power grid, supply shortage still exists in some areas of Australia, energy storage trend is gaining importance as a counter to this situation,” the company said. “If the grid is lost, the system would switch to back-up mode and AC output is supplied via the emergency power supply (EPS) load port using energy from PV and battery.”
JinkoSolar APAC country manager Thomas Bywater said the Suntank system provides an efficient solution for owners looking to implement effective residential energy management, helping to reduce costs, manage demand, and maximise the self-utilisation of power generation.
“As one of the most mature photovoltaic markets in the world, we believe that energy storage will become an indispensable part of the Australian market,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/25/agl-commits-40-million-to-upgrade-victorian-hydro-scheme/,"ENERGY STORAGE,PUMPED HYDRO,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 25, 2022",AGL commits $40 million to upgrade Victorian hydro scheme,"Australia’s largest energy generator AGL Energy has committed to a significant upgrade of the 395 MW Kiewa Hydro Scheme in Victoria’s Alpine region, announcing on Monday it will invest $40 million to modernise and upgrade its ageing Clover hydro power plant.
The 29 MW Clover hydro station is one of four power plants that comprise the Kiewa Hydro Scheme which generates an average of 404 GWh of renewable electricity each year, providing “crucial support” to the electricity system.
AGL chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said the Clover Modernisation Project would see the output capacity of the Kiewa scheme increase by 14 MW, the equivalent of powering the entire Alpine region.
“By making this targeted investment, we are able to increase the efficiency of the station and broader scheme to deliver more reliable, clean energy,” he said.
The work to be undertaken includes the replacement of turbines, generators and inlet valves to increase the throughput at Clover from 120 megalitres per hour (ML/h) to 140 ML/h, in turn increasing the entire Kiewa scheme’s ability to run at capacity.
Brokhof said the investment would achieve a 7% increase in overall generation with no change to water storage levels.
“Clover is the oldest station in the Kiewa Scheme and was commissioned in 1945,” he said. “As some of the kit becomes outdated and inefficient, there are quick wins to be made in increasing generation capacity by replacing old components and systems.”
The design and fabrication works are expected to commence in the coming weeks with AGL anticipating the upgrade will be complete by 2026.
AGL’s hydroelectricity accounts for only about 2% of the Victoria’s overall power consumption, approximately 1280 MWh per annum, but Brokhof said it plays a key role, providing “crucial support to the electricity system in the event of peak demand periods or other generator outages”.
AGL said the Clover Modernisation Project builds on the $4.8 billion the company has invested over the past 20 years in renewable and firming generation and the more than 2.3 GW of new generation capacity it has added to the grid since 2003.

A new report by NITI Aayog estimates India’s overall lithium battery storage requirement to be around 600 GWh for the period 2021-30. The report considered annual requirement across grid, consumer electronics, behind-the-meter (BTM), and electric vehicle applications to arrive at the cumulative demand.
The recycling volume coming from the deployment of these batteries will be 125 GWh for 2021–30. Out of this, almost 58 GWh will be from electric vehicles segment alone, with a total volume of 349,000 tons from chemistries like lithium iron phosphate (LFP), lithium manganese oxide (LMO), lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC), lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxide (NCA), and lithium titanate oxide (LTO).
The recycling volume potential from grid and BTM applications will be 33.7 GWh and 19.3 GWh, with 358,000 tons of batteries comprising LFP, LMO, NMC and NCA chemistries.
The report added the nation would see a consolidated investment of US$47.8 billion (AU$68.8) from 2021 to 2030 to cater to the demand for 600 GWh across all the segments of battery energy storage. Around 63% of this investment portfolio would be covered by the electric mobility segment, followed by grid applications (23%), BTM applications (07%) and CEAs (08%).
The report estimated battery storage demand of 600 GWh by 2030 – considering a base case scenario and with segments like EVs and consumer electronics (‘behind the meter’, BTM) projected to be major demand drivers for the adoption of battery storage in India.

Arizona-based startup New Use Energy Solutions has unveiled SunTarp, a new line of portable frameless solar PV panels for off-grid and residential applications.
“We found that adhering multiple modules to a custom vinyl tarp allows the user to reconfigure the modules strings to accommodate 12, 24 & 48V off-grid systems all the way up to residential type all-in-one inverters that require over 120 Vdc to charge batteries. ,” the company’s COO, Lee Feliciano, told pv magazine. “Our module provider is US-based Merlin Solar.”
The flexible modules provided by Merlin Solar are based on monocrystalline solar cells with an efficiency of over 25% provided by US manufacturer Sunpower. Their power output ranges from 50 to 150 W and their weight spans from 1.2 to 2.68 kg.
Their open-circuit voltage is between 20.8 and 21.1 V and the short-circuit current is from 3.12 to 9.10 A. The modules can be curved to a maximum 30-degree arc and can be affixed by adhesive or grommets. The junction box is sealed and waterproof. Holes on panels are pre-drilled for fast mounting.
New Use Energy Solutions’ PV array is available in three versions; the TriFold SunTarp array, which combines three solar modules, weighs 6.8 kg and has a power output of 210 W; the 320 W FourFold SunTarp model that integrates four panels and weighs in at 10.8 kg; and the six-module HexFold SunTarp which has a power output of 410 W and has a weight of 20.4 kg.
“They store easily even in the trunk of compact cars, and we can scale them into larger arrays,” the company’s CEO, Paul Shmotolokha, stated. “Our modules are 30% lighter than traditional monocrystalline solar panels and easy to fold, carry and stow.”
According to the company’s website, the TriFold SunTarp array is sold at US$906.53 (AU$1304), while the FourFold SunTarp and HexFold SunTarp have a price of US$1,318.45 (AU$1898) and US$1,806.13 (AU$2600), respectively. “They provide way more power than the rather small tiny panel kits that small portable power stations provide,” Feliciano stated.
