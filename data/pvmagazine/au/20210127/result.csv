“Right now, hydrogen is not even close,” Professor Wills, Managing Director and owner of Future Smart Strategies, told pv magazine Australia.
Essentially, this is because markets tend to prefer single market solutions, Professor Wills says. In other words, monopolies. Think, for example, of Google. Despite all the hype around the potential for democratisation on the internet, just a handful of companies today own and operate the lion’s share. Once a company or technology claws the upper hand, its difficult to stop its ascent. Market advantage tends to stick.

Which is precisely what Professor Wills believes will happen with lithium batteries, leaving hydrogen in its wake. “Hydrogen as transport fuel is still a long way behind lithium batteries.” 
This, he says, is also telling, since hydrogen has been pursued industrially for about 100 years, where lithium batteries have only been a serious staple for around 15 years. In terms of learning curves and the improved economics that goes with them, hydrogen has had a lot longer but continues to have far less impressive returns.
Today, the global electric vehicle fleet is believed to be more than 10 million. According to EV Volumes, a EV sales world database, sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) rose from 2.26 million for 2019, to 3.24 million in 2020.
These numbers definitively dwarfs hydrogen fuel cell vehicle fleets, which is in the tens of thousands. In a direct sense today, there are simply more EVs being made, which means it’s easier, it’s cheaper, there’s more of a market for them. Wright’s Law is on EVs’ side.
Professor Ray Wills
So, is it possible for hydrogen to shoot out from behind? Technically, yes, Professor Wills says. But it would need a great push, nothing short of a miraculous invention that could double hydrogen’s efficiency would make it real competitor. Does that seem probable? “Not in the next 5 years.” Which is the timeline the Future Smart Strategies’ MD says hydrogen has to stake its claim before batteries consolidate their position.
The other thing that could see hydrogen take off though is if lithium batteries don’t perform. That is, if their prices and the battery densities for range don’t meet consumer needs. Given the rapid progress batteries have seen in the last decade, however, Professor Wills gives little weight to the scenario.
Why hydrogen has received the hype it has is because, Professor Wills says, oil and gas companies can no longer ignore that they need to move into the renewable game. They’re sticking to something they know – gas – although, as Professor Wills notes, hydrogen is a very different molecule to the gases the industry customarily deals in.
This echoes the sentiments of Smart Energy Council’s CEO John Grimes, who believes fossil fuel companies see hydrogen as a lifeline. Which is why the Council is vehement about finalising its Zero Carbon Scheme to certify green hydrogen as a matter of top priority.
Professor Wills, however, doesn’t quite share the Council’s expectation of a ‘global wave.’ Which is not to say he sees no role for hydrogen, specifically green hydrogen, in the future, but rather that he thinks the fuel will remain a straggler, unable to break out from behind batteries’ shadow.
Another factor is the issue of infrastructure. While it’s touted that hydrogen will be easier to roll out than EV charging stations, since we already have petrol stations dotting our streets, the tanks, hoses and ancillary infrastructure still needs to be built into those sites. So as it stands, Professor Wills says electric charging stations are also winning the infrastructure battle. “Could be overturned? Yes, if someone were to pour money at it.”
Government funds are still the driving force behind installing hydrogen infrastructure. EV charging station infrastructure, on the other hand, is already being competitively installed. “It just adds a layer to the advantage.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/27/cumulative-corporate-commitments-drive-demand-for-2-8-gw-of-renewable-electricity/,"HIGHLIGHTS,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 27, 2021",Cumulative corporate commitments drive demand for 2.8 GW of renewable electricity,"The report, released today, shows the cumulative commitments of Australia corporations which surged in 2020, accounting for 1.8 GW of the 2.8 GW total. The retail industry emerged as the clear leader in the corporate race to renewables in 2020 with almost double the clean energy commitments of the next best performing industry, telecommunications.
In total, 28 of Australia’s biggest electricity-using companies have now made renewable energy commitments that, together, are the equivalent to powering 1.3 million households – almost all the homes in Brisbane and Perth combined – and will create 5041 clean energy jobs.
Just looking at 2020, the best year for Greenpeace’s ongoing REenergise campaign, pledges from retailers Aldi, Woolworths, Bunnings and Officeworks alone will drive 1893 MW of demand for renewable energy projects, largely over the next 5 years, creating 3,407 jobs.
Greenpeace
2020’s spike was largely thanks to Woolworths’ and Telstra’s commitments, with the companies each using 1% of total electricity Australia consumes. Woolworths is Australia’s 6th largest electricity user and will switch to 100% renewable electricity by 2025, which will require around 880 MW of solar and wind projects. As of November 2020, the supermarket chain has installation solar systems at more than 150 of its locations nationally. Another huge electricity user, Telstra’s switch, which will also happen by 2025, will see demand for 509 MW worth of renewable projects.
ALDI has set the most ambitious timeline for its transition – announcing it will be powered by 100% renewables by 2021 – and has signed two major deals with wind farms in NSW and Victoria.
Coles is now the only major Australian supermarket chain that has not committed to a 100% renewable energy target. The supermarket giant has, however, recently signed two major power purchase agreements in NSW and Queensland. The QLD deal with state government-owned generator and retailer CleanCo will see it source 90% of its electricity for its Queensland operations from locally generated wind solar.
Heavy industry commitments also made a big leap with major zinc refinery Sun Metals signing up to the RE100 initiative in November 2020, generating demand for 229 MW worth of renewable energy. Mining operations have also seen a push towards lowering emissions through the installation of solar and batteries recently, especially in Western Australia’s Goldfields.
“Who’s missing?” concludes the report. Well, surprise surprise, the Federal Government. The Guardian recently reported the Coalition has been stacking the emissions reduction panel with fossil fuel industry leaders. Alone in its resistance to Australia’s green energy transition, state governments and corporations are choosing to leave the country’s highest form of governance in its wake.
Australians are also onboard with the transition. 71% of Australians think Australian companies should set a goal to get to 100% renewables as part of their responsibility for tackling climate change, according to a UComms Poll commissioned by Greenpeace in September 2020. Likewise, 68.3% of people said they would rather work for a company that was buying renewable energy, over two thirds of respondents said they were more likely to buy a product from a company that used 100% renewable energy.

Indeed, if the university wasn’t already well on its way to achieving its ‘net zero’ by 2029 goal when it installed 7,500 solar panels at its Bundoora campus in Melbourne’s north, then it certainly is now after the installation of 1,104 panel on the roof of La Trobe’s new sports stadium. 
The new stadium was completed this month as part of Stage 2 of the University’s Sports Park development. It includes an indoor stadium with six multi-purpose highball courts, a teaching and research building with world-class sport science and analytics research laboratories, and office space for commercial tenants.
The 519 kW array atop the stadium is capable of generating approximately 724,000 kWh of solar energy annually, more than enough to meet the entire stadium’s electrical demands, with the surplus going to supplement the main campus. 
According to La Trobe, the stadium has been awarded Australia’s first “6 Star Green Star Design and As Built v1.2 certified rating” for a sports building by the Green Building Council Australia. 
La Trobe Dean School of Allied Health Human Services and Sport, Professor Russell Hoye said the state-of-the-art Sports Stadium had transformed students’ experiences and was a valuable community asset predicted to have more than 10,000 visitors a week.
“We’re very proud of the fact that we’ve been able to create this incredible facility while remaining true to La Trobe’s values of being sustainable, protecting our environment and aiming to achieve Net Zero carbon emissions by 2029,” said Hoye.
In August 2019, La Trobe University (La Trobe) committed itself to a goal of ‘net zero’ emissions by 2029 through a $75 million initiative.

Since then, the company’s AI, which links participants in state-based virtual power plants (VPPs) via Duracell 2.5-15 kWh battery storage systems, has received “significant investment in its UK and Australian energy business from fund manager CarVal investors”. Now the energy scale-up is looking to grow rapidly in the Australian market. 
According to a statement, the investment was completed in December 2020 and will help Social Energy to expand its offering to more electrical products, including hot water tanks and electric vehicles (EVs). 
Social Energy CEO, Richard Smith, said that the US-based CarVal Investor’s “involvement in the next stage of our story is an exciting development. We are delighted to have a partner on board who is heavily focused in the renewable sector and has complementary businesses across the globe.”

CarVal Investors (CarVal) is a global alternative investment fund manager with a history of renewable energy investment. CarVal has invested over US$1 billion in renewable energy in the US, including a growing portfolio shared with CleanCapital and, as recently as December 2020, CarVal Investors closed on the purchase of a 16.8 MW DC solar farm in the US from Agilitas Energy. 
“CarVal’s expertise will be invaluable in scaling the business and we are excited about taking Social Energy to new markets,” said Smith, “as well as growing our existing operations in the UK and Australia.” 
As part of CarVal’s investment, the fund manager’s Principal, Stuart Lammin, will join the Social Energy board. “We are delighted to have completed our investment in Social Energy,” said Lammin, “and are very much looking forward to helping to support their ambitions over the coming years. We have a strong commitment to the clean energy sector and supporting companies that can help drive us to a carbon-free future.” 
With home batteries and EVs on the verge of booming in this decade thanks to falling prices, it is no doubt a smart decision by CarVal to invest in a promising mover and shaker. Social Energy helps customers maximise savings and earnings from their home solar and battery systems. Currently, Social Energy has approximately 6,000 customers, but with over 2.5 million Australians with solar panels on their homes there is space enough to rapidly grow. The shorter the payback period the more interested customers become. 
Social Energy uses earnings from providing frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) to the grid and trading on energy spot markets to provide offset income to consumers.

French startups Ecosun Innovations and Mascara Nouvelles Technologies are trying to commercialise a PV-powered solution to desalinate brackish water and saltwater. They have described their Osmo-Watt solution as an autonomous, mobile drinking water production unit for isolated areas.
The two startups have combined two of their products in a single 20-foot container. Osmosun is an autonomous solar-powered desalination solution, while Mobil-Watt is a solar container that can be easily deployed in less than two hours.
The companies said the fully equipped container can be rapidly deployed in health, military or natural disaster situations, as it does not require any civil engineering expertise to set up. The reverse osmosis unit can produce up to 100 cubic meters of drinking water per day, which equals the basic needs of 5,000 people, based on the minimum consumption levels recommended by the World Health Organisation of 20 litres per day.
The container’s solar power system offers complete autonomy from external energy sources such as diesel power generators or grid electricity. It can also hybridise energy sources to produce electricity when the sun is not shining.
The French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission recently said that PV is set to become the most cost-competitive way to power desalination. The study found that PV will remain the most economical option up to 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/27/victorias-first-solar-sponge-community-battery-network-to-be-developed/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 27, 2021",Victoria’s first ‘solar sponge’ community battery network to be developed,"Yarra Energy Foundation, a not-for-profit primarily funded by the Yarra City Council, on Wednesday announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding with CitiPower to pursue a new model of community batteries, the first of its kind in Victoria. Notably, the plan also involves crowdsourcing local investment.
The aim is to create a network of batteries, or “solar sponges,” located on the low-voltage electricity network across inner-Melbourne operated by CitiPower which services 332,000 customers. While rooftop solar penetration in the service area is low, sitting at just 5%, the company expects it to rise to 24% by 2026, especially with the added bonus of battery access.
The project’s first phase is already underway, identifying trial sites, developing financial modelling and relationships with market service providers including energy retailers, as well as gauging community sentiment. So far, prospects look good with the companies saying they have already received interest from investors. This will then go on to inform second phase which involves deploying the batteries on a broader scale in late 2021.
As household batteries remain relatively expensive, Dean Kline, Chief Executive Officer at the Yarra Energy Foundation, described the new model of community battery ownership as “a smart solution to give households and businesses reliable and affordable energy when they need it.”
“By sharing the batteries, customers can make the most of their investment in solar. It benefits all CitiPower customers, even if they don’t have rooftop solar, as batteries help reduce the cost of building network capacity to accommodate more power and manage localised peak demand, particularly in summer.”
The project will also help the council reach its 100% renewable energy target by 2030, while also lowering prices for consumers and improving the quality of the electricity network.
While Australia’s community mid-scale segment is still burgeoning, 2020 saw a major push with start up Komo Energy growing its project pipeline as well as solar farm projects like Haystacks, Australia’s first large scale solar garden cooperative, taking root. In Western Australia, energy provider Western Power and Synergy’s innovative PowerBank trial of community batteries is also developing, with the Australian National University’s Dr Lachlan Blackhall saying the project illustrates exciting potential for mid-scale community battery storage in Australia.
“One of the most important things about community batteries is that they open up the opportunity for everybody — people who are renting, people who live in apartments — to benefit from having additional storage in the grid, whereas if you put a battery behind the meter in someone’s home that typically is limited to people who can afford to buy the battery, or who own their own home,” Dr Blackhall told pv magazine Australia.
