In terms of annual production, that equates to 7,300 kg per year, if production runs everyday through the year.
The company will produce this green hydrogen using its own patented electrolysis technology, powered from renewable energy generated by a dedicated onsite 250 kW solar system. The hydrogen will be produced in the form of methylcyclohexane (MCH), allowing it to be stored and transported as a liquid before being converted back to hydrogen in Japan.
In partnership with Japanese engineering company Chiyoda Corporation and the Queensland University of Technology, Eneos began its Queensland-based green hydrogen technology demonstrations in 2018.
The company, which holds about 50% market share of petrol sales in Japan, already owns petroleum tankers, storage tanks and refineries used for export, which are expected to be used as the hydrogen supply chain develops.
Earlier this year, Eneos also announced it would develop a 204 MW solar farm in western Queensland in partnership with fellow Japanese company Sojitz, which is reportedly set to make the production if its MCH more efficient.

Likewise, Reclaim PV announced new partnerships and drop off locations as it prepares to grow substantially in 2022.
The University of Melbourne and RMIT University have partnered with the Melbourne-based company OJAS to develop an ‘upcycling’ facility which will reclaim valuable materials from PV modules including clean glass, silicon cells and polymers.
The project originally commenced last year, in 2020, after OJAS was awarded a $3 million federal government project grant. CEO Neeraj Das said a site lease in Victoria has been secured in June for the facility, and the European separation technology it plans to use to cost-effectively recover glass, silicon cells and polymer from PV panel waste will soon be tested and commissioned.

The upcycling plant, which the team say is the ‘first of its kind’, is expected to be up and running by the end of 2023. It will collect modules via a nation-wide network and supply the recovered materials to downstream businesses for value-added products. The ambition is to rollout the solution across Australia.
Currently the project’s collaborators at the University of Melbourne and RMIT are looking to find “optimal applications” of these recovered PV components. According to their statement, research to date has found the fine particles of ground PV glass can be effectively used as a partial replacement for sand in concrete. 
Dr Massoud Sofi, the project’s research lead from the University of Melbourne, says this application can conserve raw materials used for concrete production and reduce its carbon footprint – which is astoundingly high, responsible for for 8% of emissions globally. The research team are apparently now looking at developing specific applications of the PV glass-based concrete materials too. 
At RMIT, a team led by Dr Ylias Sabri, is investigating whether the refined materials could be reused in solar panel production. They are also looking at the processing of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), a material with good radiation transmission and low degradability to sunlight.
South Australian company Reclaim PV Recycling is also gearing up to expand its operations which begun this year with the launch of its first recycling facility in Adelaide. It recently welcomed three new network partners, RAA, Enerven and Tindo, two new drop off locations, and two new recycling hubs in Townsville and Bundaberg in preparation.

It expects to collect more than 90,000 panels or the equivalent of 3,000 tonnes of PV modules in 2022. “These partnerships are an important step forward in the establishment of Australia’s first national solar panel recovery and recycling network, and importantly, offer Australians an easy way to arrange the responsible recycling of their end-of-life solar panels,” Director of Reclaim PV Recycling, Clive Fleming, said.
Notably, Reclaim’s partnership with Tindo, Australia’s only solar panel manufacturer, creates a full recycling loop for Australian-made solar panels. 
Reclaim uses a recycling process known as pyrolysis – a thermal deconstruction technique which breaks down and pulls apart PV panels into their component parts by passing them through a high-temperature furnace. Upon completion of the thermal extraction process, the recovered components are sorted and placed into collection bins for delivery to materials companies, ensuring all recoverable materials are available for re-use.

Reclaim’s recycling facility followed Lotus Energy’s Victorian plant, Australia’s first, which began operating in May.
According to the International Renewable Agency, the value of materials from solar module recycling and upcycling will be worth around US$15 billion (AU$21 billion) by the year 2050.

A group of researchers from Germany’s Forschungszentrum Jülich has developed a planar perovskite solar cell that is claimed to reach over 1,400 hours of operational stability at elevated temperatures.
Before choosing the perovskite material for the cell, the scientists tested hundreds of different perovskite mixtures and investigated, in particular, their thermal stability using a self-constructed, high-throughput screening platform.
The 20.9% efficient device was built without the ionic dopants or metal oxide nanoparticles that are commonly used to contact the cell, as these can be subject to secondary reactions at higher temperatures, they further explained.
The entire cell electrode was embedded in a sort of protective shell with a double-layer polymer structure, with the bottom side undoped and the top side doped with a non-ionic dopant, which is claimed to protect against degradation and, at the same time, ensures that the contact is maintained. “This architecture protects the very sensitive interface to the perovskite and, on the other hand, it shows exceptionally stable conductivity, even at elevated temperatures,” they emphasised. “The dopant-free polymer provides an acid barrier between the perovskite and the acid-doped polymer.”
Under standard illumination conditions, the cell was able to operate for 1,450 hours at elevated temperatures of around 65 degrees Celsius and, at the end of the testing period, it still retained 99% of its original efficiency.
“Long-term prediction is always difficult but the perovskite solar cell we have now developed could certainly be operated for more than 20,000 hours, under normal circumstances,” said researcher Christoph Brabec.
The cell was presented in the paper A bilayer conducting polymer structure for planar perovskite solar cells with over 1,400 hours operational stability at elevated temperatures, which was recently published in nature energy.
Looking forward, the academics say they want to improve cell efficiency. “With an efficiency of 20.9%, the tested cell does not yet fully exploit the potential. Twenty-four to 25% should be possible in the near future,” explained research co-author, Yicheng Zhao.
