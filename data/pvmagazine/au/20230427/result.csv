While we do anticipate a rise in prices during peak periods, Cornwall Insight’s Benchmark Power Curve predicts a lower median price.
In addition, the generating capacity of Liddell Power Station has significantly declined in recent years, dropping from 2,000 MW to 800 MW due to the earlier closure of LD03 and underutilisation of the remaining three turbines. As a result, the impact of the closure may not be as severe during non-peak times as initially anticipated.

Cornwall Insight’s Benchmark Power Curve (BPC) forecasts NSW’s upcoming summer to have a lower median price than the previous three years. However, as Figure 1 shows, it is much more likely for the spot price to reach $12,000/MWh during this upcoming summer than the previous years. While very high peak prices are still quite rare, these occurrences skew the distribution resulting in a forecasted higher average price this summer.
Corey Drum, Energy Market Specialist at Cornwall Insight Australia, said: “The anticipated rise in peak-time power prices following the closure of Liddell power station underscores the need for investment in effective battery storage systems. Deploying these systems in NSW could help mitigate the impact of high prices and complement existing solar resources, enabling users to take advantage of high evening prices or generate revenue through energy arbitrage.
“While easing the fallout from the closure of Liddell should be a priority for NSW, we must keep the impact in perspective. Unlike previous power station closures such as Hazelwood, NSW has had time to prepare for the loss of generation capacity and has responded with the expansion of other energy projects. The contribution of Liddell has also been overestimated, meaning the closure could be less damaging than it first appears.
“As we wait to see the effects the closure will have on power prices, one thing is for sure, NSW must stay vigilant and committed to supporting the continued expansion of renewable energy and energy storage solutions. We believe that these measures will not only help stabilise the grid but also lead to more sustainable, affordable energy for consumers in the long-term.”

The CEFC said the finance will play “a significant role in driving private sector investment in the small- to mid-market renewables space where there has been a traditional funding gap.”
CEFC Chief Investment Officer for renewables and sustainable finance, Monique Miller, said the investment through Canberra-based Infradebt would sit alongside the corporation’s investments in utility-scale renewable generation and storage.
Miller highlighted that Australia’s “very ambitious” renewable energy goals require a “substantial and sustained increase” in investment across the sector.
“This CEFC investment, with its focus on smaller-scale generators, complements our focus on large-scale solar and wind generation, essential energy storage and grid transmission, all of which will play a critical role in powering our net-zero future,” she said.
The expanded mandate will see the CEFC coinvest alongside Infradebt’s flagship Infradebt Ethical Fund (IEF) in new Australian renewable energy projects with a capacity of up to 50 MW.
Infradebt Chief Executive Officer Alexander Austin said the mandate, originally established in 2019, has already provided backing for nine small- to mid-sized solar projects and the increased funding commitment would support more private sector investment in this space.
“This capital will boost Infradebt’s capacity to continue to provide debt finance to Australian renewable projects,” he said.
Projects which have already secured funding under the CEFC-Infradebt mandate include the 4.95 MW Leeton and Fivebough solar farms developed in southern New South Wales (NSW) by Netherlands-based Photon Energy.
German developer Enerparc secured debt financing for 5 MW solar farms at Trundle Hill and Peak Hill near Parkes in central-west NSW that were recently acquired by the investment arm of Ikea franchisee owner Ingka Group, while the mandate has also provided backing for a portfolio of five solar farms being developed in northern Victoria by Sungrove Energy.
While the focus of this investment mandate will remain on generation projects, Infradebt recently launched a fund focused solely on grid-scale energy storage.
Infradebt, backed by Grok Ventures, the private investment firm of tech billionaires Mike and Anne Cannon-Brookes, said the ETF will provide debt finance for six to eight utility-scale battery projects with a total capacity of up to 2 GW over coming years.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/27/victoria-mandates-new-standards-for-solar-and-battery-retailers/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 27, 2023",Victoria mandates new standards for solar and battery retailers,"State government agency Solar Victoria has confirmed that it will replace its existing mandatory requirement for solar and battery retailers in the state to be signatories to the Clean Energy Council’s (CEC) Solar Retailer Code of Conduct, requiring instead that they commit to the recently launched New Energy Tech Consumer Code (NETCC).
Solar Victoria said to remain an authorised solar retailer under the Solar Homes and Solar for Business programs, solar and battery retailers in the state are now required to maintain the status of New Energy Tech (NET) Approved Seller.
Existing Approved Solar Retailers (ASR) will automatically transfer to the new code and more than 1,000 Victorian retailers are now approved and will be able to continue to participate in the Solar Homes program. New businesses interested in participating have been advised to now apply directly to the CEC which will administer the NETCC.
Having been authorised by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the NETCC replaced the ASR program earlier this year. The new code extends the consumer protection standards of the ASR program beyond solar and storage to also cover other new and emerging energy technologies including electric vehicle (EV) charging and home energy management systems.
The NETCC sets minimum standards of practice and consumer protection in relation to all aspects of customers’ interactions with participating retailers. This includes marketing, finance and payments, installation, warranties and complaints handling processes.
Solar Victoria Chief Executive Officer Stan Krpan said the shift to the new code of conduct is important for the integrity and ongoing development of the solar industry in the state.
“It builds on existing protections and broadens them to home batteries and will grow over time to cover emerging new technologies such as smart car chargers,” he said. “It is important that consumer protections keep up with these innovations.”
CEC Chief Executive Officer Kane Thornton welcomed Solar Victoria’s decision to require solar and battery retailers to be signatories to the NETCC, saying it not only puts consumers first but supports better outcomes for the solar industry.
“The NETCC is a safety net for consumers, enabling them to make an informed purchasing decision as well as being assured that they are protected by an ACCC authorised program that amplifies existing consumer protections,” he said.

CS Energy said when complete the battery, being built beside the existing 750 MW coal-fired Kogan Creek Power Station near Chinchilla, will better facilitate the use of renewable energy in Queensland and strengthen the electricity grid during peak demand periods.
CS Energy Acting Chief Executive Officer Andrew Varvari said the battery is part of the company’s strategy to build a more diverse portfolio to meet customers’ requirements and support Queensland’s future energy needs.
“Batteries are fast and flexible, with the ability to ramp up and down quickly to support the stability of the power and reduce wholesale price volatility,” he said.
“When operational, the Chinchilla Battery will charge during the day when there is often a surplus of solar energy and then release it back into the grid when it is needed the most.”
The Chinchilla battery, which will connect to the grid via network operator Powerlink’s existing 275 kV Western Downs substation, is the foundation project in a clean energy hub CS Energy is creating at the Kogan Creek site.

The hub will also include the Kogan Renewable Hydrogen Demonstration Plant which is to feature a circa 1 MW hydrogen electrolyser powered by a co-located 2 MW solar farm. The project will also include a hydrogen fuel cell of up to 30 kW, on-site hydrogen storage and out-loading facility.
The solar-powered hydrogen facility, which is set to produce approximately 75 tonnes of green hydrogen annually, is expected to be operating before the end of 2023.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said construction of the hydrogen plant is expected to begin soon with the clean energy hub being delivered as part of the state government’s $62 billion clean energy plan that aims to deliver 70% renewable energy by 2032 and 80% by 2035.
“These clean energy hubs are a key element of the Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan, diversifying the generation technology at our publicly owned coal-fired sites and enabling local communities and workers to be partners in the energy transformation,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/27/taronga-hit-renewables-target-with-new-energy-deal/,"SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 27, 2023",Taronga hit renewables target with new energy deal,"The Taronga and Taronga Western Plains Zoo in New South Wales (NSW) are now being powered by 100% renewable energy after the Taronga Conservation Society Australia signed a five-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Red Energy, the energy retailer owned by Snowy Hydro.
Taronga said the TrueGreen deal, which comprises 100% renewable energy matched with 100% renewable large-scale generation certificates (LGCs), means the operational electricity use at the Taronga Zoo, located on the shores of Sydney Harbour, and the Taronga Western Plans Zoo near Dubbo in central west NSW, are now being powered by 100% renewable electricity.
The renewable energy is being provided by British-headquartered solar developer Lightsource BP’s 174 MW Wellington Solar Farm, located about 50 kilometres southeast of Dubbo. The facility came online in 2020 and is now operating at full capacity, generating approximately 435,000 MWh of clean electricity a year with most of the output contracted by the federal government-owned Snowy Hydro via a 15-year PPA.
While the solar farm has been providing 100% renewable electricity to power the zoos’ operations since the start of the year, Taronga said the intermittent nature of solar supply means the electricity may at times be firmed with Red Energy’s hydro assets.
Taronga Conservation Society Australia Chief Executive Officer Cameron Kerr said the switch to Red Energy has allowed the not-for-profit organisation to achieve its target to be powered by 100% renewable electricity before 2030 well ahead of schedule.
Kerr said the transition means the zoos will avoid approximately 7,000 tonnes of carbon emissions each year, but more importantly, clean energy is a step towards helping secure a future for all animals.
“Climate change is a key threatening process that has an impact on many of Australia’s unique flora and fauna, and wildlife across the globe,” he said. “More than 1,900 species in Australia are on the brink of extinction and climate change is accelerating this process. However, renewable energy sources such as solar and wind emit little to no greenhouse gas, which is the biggest contributor to climate change.”
The deal with Red Energy is just the latest action from Taronga in its sustainability journey. Taronga has more than 500 kW of solar panels installed across the two sites in Sydney and Dubbo, conducted recent energy audits with the view to implement further efficiencies and savings and has also implemented policies for low-emissions new buildings.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/27/pv-powered-robotic-lawn-mower-from-new-zealand/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NEW ZEALAND",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"APRIL 27, 2023",PV-powered robotic lawn mower from New Zealand,"From pv magazine Global
A Massey AgriFood Digital Lab team based at Massey University in New Zealand has developed a PV-powered robotic lawn mower.
The SunScout Pro features three fully integrated 50 W solar panels that charge a 20 Ah lithium-iron-phosphate (LiFePO4) battery. One of the PV panels is located on top of the robot, while two additional modules are fixed onto a sliding, retractable structure.
“By stripping down the solar module to its essentials and adopting more efficient protective designs in conjunction with our flagship stacked panel configuration, we were able to create lightweight solar panel solutions that are perfect for mobile applications,” the research team says on the product’s website.
The PV system has a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) voltage range between 15 V and 45 V. The MPPT solar charger has an efficiency of over 99% and the maximum solar power input is 400 W. The LiFePO4 battery has a rated voltage of 38,4 V and an energy capacity of 768 Wh. The team claims it features 5,000 charge cycles.
“Assuming that the SunScout Pro charges its batteries an average of four times per week, which is equivalent to 208 times annually, the guaranteed 5,000 charging cycles would provide up to 24 years of usage,” says the research team.
When the robotic lawn mower’s batteries are low, it slides out its two extra PV panels and tracks the sun for faster recharging. The average battery charging time is four hours at 70% discharge. The device measures 850 mm x 450 mm x 400 mm and weighs 45 kg. Its cutting width is 40 cm and the cutting height is programmable between 25 mm to 75 mm. It mulches grass at a speed of 50 meters per minute, covering an area of 1,200 square meters per charge.
The concept was first developed in 2020 and its feasibility was reportedly confirmed by a Massey University study in 2021. The project underwent prototype testing in December 2022 and a working prototype was completed in January 2023. The Massey University team started setting up assembly lines in New Zealand and Germany in February this year and is now trying to gather customer support through a Kickstarter campaign. If successful, it plans to launch the product in June and start shipments by August.
The products will feature a two-year warranty and will retail for USD 2,630 ($4,000) according to the Kickstarter campaign page.
