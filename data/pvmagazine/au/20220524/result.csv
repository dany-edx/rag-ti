In a recent pv magazine webinar, Wood Mackenzie Principle Analyst Daniel Liu described O&M automation as, “one of the last few place to unlock additional cost efficiencies on a project.”
The webinar was delivered in partnership with robotic cleaning provider Ecoppia, and the company’s CTO Ziv Ramati Miller noted that with two years of Covid-19 lockdowns making site visits at time impossible, automated O&M became the only way production, and profitability, could be maintained.
“It was only on sites that were fully automated that production was allowed to continue almost the same,” said Ramati Miller. “You needed to implement automation just to stay where you are.”
Given the imperative to adopt automation in O&M, pv magazine has partnered with Ecoppia to conduct a first-of-its kind survey into the subject. The short survey has been designed to take less than five minutes to complete and has been constructed to reveal insights into the opportunities for automation in O&M, and potential impediments to its more widespread adoption.
Complete the survey to influence how automation will be employed in O&M provision today and into the future.
While O&M may not be the first item on a project developer’s agenda, the webinar presenters agreed that how plants are to be maintained should be considered in the early development stages.
“It is true that solar is a very simple and robust technology, but we must keep in mind that your project starts with the early development phase and sometimes we tend to overlook some key considerations,” said Nicolas Chouluer, a partner at Europe-based independent engineers Everoze. “Good maintenance will help keep your asset viable.”
In terms of good maintenance, Ecoppia CTO Ramati Miller argued that technological development has delivered a host of opportunities for O&M automation. And in the current solar market, it is “not only a possibility but a necessity.
“You really have to combine the data from all sources, and it is not just about solar panel cleaning, but infrastructure, and corrective maintenance. If you can tell in advance which panels need to be switched, then you don’t need to have people on site constantly monitoring the situation. But you need to combine all of these [data] sources.”
Ramati Miller outlined how it is possible today to equip robotic cleaners with a host of sensors that can collect detailed information on module health – and importantly how things develop over time. With robots passing over modules on a regular basis, their ability to collect data in an ongoing fashion is unparalleled, he said.
“There are a lot of options for what can be fitted to a robot,” said Ramati Miller. As an example, he explained how simple sensors can monitor a tracking system’s health.
“One of the most basic situations we offer is just [to monitor] the angle of the panels. When we measure that we can see if angle keeps changing on trackers. Usually, you have a sensor in the middle of a row, at the motor, which might cover two tables. But the angle at the corners might change, and just by monitoring the angles in the corners it lets you know about material fatigue.”
In terms of the size of the opportunity, Wood Mackenzie’s Daniel Liu explains that given the current size of the installed PV fleet, “as a rule the industry needs to be much more proactive about all O&M and in this module washing.” He said that WoodMac anticipates annual non-residential solar O&M spend to reach $15 billion by 2030.
“Automation should ultimately help asset owner identify the true site conditions and give people a better handle on what is needed,” said Liu. “Predominately we have seen is that degradation is much higher and one of the main reasons why is that the soiling losses are higher than expected – even in place where you would expect rain to be quite frequent.”
The survey results will be presented and analyzed in the pv magazine Global magazine.

Those connections will be allowed in instances where it may be cheaper, safer and more reliable than connection to the grid.
Western Australia, which is not part of Australia’s main national electricity market (NEM), has already found quite literally thousands of instances where this is the case. Its rollout of standalone systems has established them as capable of improving reliability and reducing both maintenance costs for networks and emissions for regional and rural customers.

Yet, until now, network providers have not been able to offer standalone solutions to their existing eastern customers because of bureaucracy. 
The Australian Energy Regulator is now changing that. Last week, it opened the consultation period for six documents relating to the National Electricity Amendment (Regulated stand-alone power systems) Rule 2022 (Amending Rule). 
The documents, it said, are guidelines for distributors to deliver outcomes that are in the best interest of electricity customers. The affected guidelines are:
The changes will ultimately allow networks to connect customers to standalone systems, which will then become known as ‘regulated SAPS.’
“Customers connected to regulated SAPS will not be disadvantaged,” the Regulator said in its update on the changes. “They will receive an equivalent level of consumer protections and will pay for their electricity in the same way as grid customers. Both SAPS and grid customers can benefit from lower charges and improved system resilience,” it added in its explanatory statement.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/24/labor-already-under-fire-over-imminent-fossil-fuel-projects/,"POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 24, 2022",Labor already under fire over imminent fossil fuel projects,"Jaded by their 2019 defeat, in opposition Labor infamously refused to pause the pipeline of fossil fuel projects under development which, if completed, could more than double the current domestic carbon emissions of Australia.
That position has come back to bite them on the very same day Albanese committed Australia to a stronger 2030 emissions reduction target of 43%.
The Greens, which enjoyed their strongest ever election result to date on Saturday, want to see that figure at 75%, while many of the ‘teal’ Independents are backing fellow Zali Steggall’s Climate Act Now bill which calls for a 60% reduction. In short, both are looking for stronger commitments, and both want a pause on new fossil fuel projects.
At the time of writing, Labor had secured 74 seats in the House, still shy of the 76 need to form a majority government. Even if Labor is able to secure a majority, it will likely need to work closely with the Greens and the independent crossbench to pass legislation, especially through the senate – where the Greens have an even stronger position. 
Their leader, Adam Bandt, has today agreed with former WA premier, Liberal Colin Barnett who told the Australian Financial Review, “climate change is what people talked about and Labor talked about [at the election] so it will be difficult to achieve a tougher target for 2030 when you’ve got a big project like Scarborough.”
A joint venture from Woodside and BHP, the $16.5 billion Scarborough gas project in Western Australia was given final approval earlier this year, despite the fact the Conservation Council of Western Australia and the Australia Institute released found it would release 1.6 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases across its lifetime.
“Colin Barnett is right that if Labor proceeds with climate bombs like the Scarborough gas project, the increased emissions will ‘dwarf everything else’ and Labor won’t meet even its own weak climate targets,” Bandt said.
“Labor proceeding with climate-destroying gas projects like Scarborough and Beetaloo would indeed be breaking a promise with people who voted for more climate action.”
Like Scarborough, Origin Energy’s project in the Northern Territory’s Beetaloo Basin has been widely criticised. The Greens claim it could increase Australia’s emissions by as much as 13%.
Bandt also pointed out the economic impacts of pausing the pipeline of fossil fuel projects would likely have little flow on effect in terms of the federal government’s revenues. “Coal and gas corporations are amongst the most egregious tax avoiders in the country, so stopping new projects will have a very manageable impact on the federal budget,” he said.
“The first rule of dealing with an emergency is to stop making the problem worse but Labor is vowing to open up new methane projects like Scarborough and Beetaloo, adding fuel to the fire and putting a safe climate further out of reach,” he added.
“These projects can still be stopped. The incoming government has the power to hit the pause button, and that’s what the scientists are telling us we need to do.”

The partnership will see Sungrow will provide its inverters as well as its new liquid-cooled PowerTitan energy storage system to build a total of 176 MWh of DC coupled systems. 
The installations retrofitting Sungrow’s inverters and batteries are expected to be completed before the end of the year, with the solar farms themselves already operational.
The Ginan Solar Portfolio, to which the 16 Victorian solar farms belong, has been developed by Providence Asset Group, a cofounder of Lavo. The Lavo startup was established in 2020 to commercialise technology which uses hydrides to store hydrogen in metal alloys, originally developed by the University of New South Wales. 
The Victorian portfolio includes ~5 MW solar farms at Katamatite, Numurkah, Echuca and Stanhope while the development pipeline includes solar projects at Manilla, South Tamworth, Guyra and Gunnedah in New South Wales, taking the total portfolio to almost 40 ~5 MW solar farms across both states.
It is believed Sungrow will also be involved in the projects under development in NSW, though details of this arrangement have not been released.
Sungrow said its DC coupled storage solution, which will feature its new PowerTitan battery as the core device, requires only one inverter to complete the project, reduces efficiency losses and therefore significantly lowers project costs.
“Sungrow is the only supplier who can provide a DC-coupled storage solution in Australia, which is an unparalleled advantage we appreciate,” Alan Yu, Lavo’s CEO said. 
He added that Lavo planned to “expand” its cooperation with Sungrow to supply more renewable energy projects in future, perhaps hinting at the NSW pipeline. It appears there is no clear distinction between the tightly enmeshed Providence Asset Group and Lavo in terms of the Ginan pipeline’s developers.
Earlier this year, Australian investment manager Infrastructure Capital Group moved into the solar sector by acquiring a major stake in the Ginan portfolio. It has committed $100 million in the pipeline, with the option to significantly scale the investment further to include co-located batteries and hydrogen, pv magazine Australia reported at the time. 
The lithium battery installations are now, obviously, coming to fruition, and Lavo has previously said it hopes to also install its hydrogen battery solutions at the solar farms dotted across regional Victoria and NSW. In fact, the company last year finalised a $33 million project financing agreement with the Commonwealth Bank to do so.
The solar portfolio is not only interesting because of the plans to deploy Lavo’s hybrid hydrogen batteries but also because of their mid-scale size.
Each of the 16 sites consists of a ~5 MW distribution-connected solar plant with the smaller scale employed to accelerate the speed of approval (projects around the 5 MW mark are significantly easier to connect to the grid than larger solar farms), construction, and connection. The mid-scale size also affords greater flexibility in deploying various types of energy storage.

The Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) has developed a single atomic cobalt-based catalyst with approximately 40% improved performance and stability compared to contemporary cobalt nanoparticle catalysts. “Previously reported single-atomic catalysts can only be produced in small quantities because the chemical substances and synthesis methods used varied depending on the type of the synthesised catalyst,” KIST said.
The European Commission said it will roll out carbon contracts for difference to support the uptake of green hydrogen by industry. It will also offer specific financing for REPowerEU under the Innovation Fund, along with two delegated acts on the definition and production of renewable hydrogen. The commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, said that the European executive body is assessing state aid for hydrogen projects as a priority, while also working on EU financing schemes.
BP and German chemical producer Linde have announced plans to advance a major carbon capture and storage (CCS) project in Texas to enable “low-carbon hydrogen” production at Linde’s existing facilities. “Upon completion, the project will capture and store CO2 from Linde’s hydrogen production facilities in the greater Houston area – and potentially from its other Texas facilities – to produce low carbon hydrogen for the region,” said BP. “The low-carbon hydrogen will be sold to customers along Linde’s hydrogen pipeline network under long-term contracts to enable production of low-carbon chemicals and fuels.” 
The Africa Green Hydrogen Alliance has kicked off in Kenya, South Africa, Namibia, Egypt, Morocco, and Mauritania. It aims to make the continent a frontrunner in the development of green hydrogen. The countries “intend to foster collaboration on creating a sustainable enabling environment to supercharge green hydrogen development,” according to a press release.
Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners has proposed the construction of an artificial island dedicated to the large-scale production of green hydrogen from offshore wind in the Danish part of the North Sea. “The island is expected to be able to supply an unprecedented amount of green hydrogen by 2030 and will thus be a crucial step in securing Europe’s future green energy supply,” said the Danish fund manager.
The Danish Energy Agency said that it will set up a new secretariat this summer to assist the authorities and project developers in creating an overview of regulatory treatment and approval processes, while monitoring the development of Power-to-X products in Denmark. 
The UK government has announced up to GBP 60 million ($74.9 million) of government funds to develop hydrogen. The funding has been awarded to 28 projects across the United Kingdom. ITM Power is set to receive more than GBP 9.2 million to build a next-generation 5 MW electrolyser stack. 
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Technical University of Munich have designed a new kind of glucose fuel cell that converts glucose directly into electricity. “The device is smaller than other proposed glucose fuel cells, measuring just 400 nanometers thick,” said MIT. The fuel cell could be incorporated into a medical implant.
Hydroplane will showcase its work on modular hydrogen fuel cell power plants for aviation and mobile energy storage at the 2022 European Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition (EBACE2022) from May 23 to May 25.

China’s National Energy Administration (NEA) has revealed that newly installed PV capacity for April in the country amounts to 3.66 GW – representing a 23% increase compared to April 2021. It also revealed that year to date in 2022, new PV systems installed in China total 16.88 GW. Overall, the country’s cumulative PV capacity reached 322.57 GW at the end of April.
Zhonghuan Semiconductor announced today that it will begin selling n-type wafers in the 210mm x 210mm format that it first introduced to the p-type market back in 2019. The company will sell the wafer at 150 micron thickness at CNY 9.49 ($1.42) per piece, and an even thinner product at 130 microns at CNY 9.06 ($1.35) per piece.
The government of Zhejiang Province released its energy development plan for the fourteenth five-year (2021-2025) period. The province is planning to build 12.45 GW more solar PV from now to the end of 2025. This would push the region’s cumulative PV installations to 27.62 GW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/24/quantum-well-superlattices-for-a-new-world-record-cell-efficiency-of-39-5/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"MAY 24, 2022",Quantum well superlattices for a new world record cell efficiency of 39.5%,"From pv magazine Global
A group of scientists led by the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) set a new world record for solar cell efficiency under normal illumination without a concentrator, achieving 39.5% with their cell based on three layers of III-V materials.
The new record pushes out NREL’s previous record of 39.2%, and with various innovations the group was able to greatly simplify the device – relying on three junctions instead of the previous six. The previous record for a three-junction solar cell was set by Sharp Corporation back in 2013, at 37.9%
The cell is described in full in the paper “Triple-junction solar cells with 39.5% terrestrial and 34.2% space efficiency enabled by thick quantum well superlattices,” recently published in Joule. The group combined layers of gallium-indium-arsenide (GaInAs), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and gallium-indium-phosphide (GaInP) to create a device that could absorb a wide segment of the solar spectrum.
Key to this approach was NREL’s latest work on “quantum wells,” which allowed it to better tune each layer to absorb a different part of the solar spectrum. “While GaAs is an excellent material and generally used in III-V multijunction cells, it does not have quite the correct bandgap for a three-junction cell, meaning that the balance of photocurrents between the three cells is not optimal,” said Ryan France, senior scientist and cell designer at NREL. “Here, we have modified the bandgap while maintaining excellent material quality by using quantum wells, which enables this device and potentially other applications.”
Quantum wells are thin nanostructures inserted into the cell layers to alter the bandgap and other properties. Using these, the group was able to raise the bandgap of the middle GaAs cell layer, to maximise its performance in unison with the other two. While the QW phenomenon is not a new discovery, various challenges working with these materials at the scale of a few nanometers have limited their practical benefits in previous research.
The group acknowledged that, for now at least, the processes and materials it is working with on these cells are too complex and expensive for most mainstream solar applications. Though NREL is working on a few different methods that could drastically reduce these costs, for now powering satellites and other space technology – where space constraints mean cost can come second to efficiency – are the only likely application for any type of solar cell based on these “III-V” materials, named for their grouping in the periodic table.
NREL also measured its triple junction quantum well cells under the light spectrum they would have to work with outside of Earth’s atmosphere, and reached a beginning of life measurement of 34.2% – which it notes is also a world record for a three-junction cell under this spectrum.
