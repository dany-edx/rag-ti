Despite the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, Ingeteam supplied 753 MW of its inverters to Australian projects in 2020. The inverters have been, or are set to be, installed at eight solar PV projects, taking the total solar power awarded to Ingeteam since its arrival in Australia to 2,096 MW.
Among the projects to utilise Ingeteam’s PV inverters are the 160 MW Maryvale  and the 39 MW Molong solar farms in New South Wales.
Ingeteam Australia director Juan Miguel Gutiérrez said the achievement complimented the Australian launch of Ingeteam Service, the company’s operation and maintenance division.
Gutiérrez said the 2 GW of power “is a nice, round number, but the important thing is that it reaffirms the confidence that our customers are placing in our solutions, in a market in which the technical requirements demanded by the power companies and grid operator are probably the toughest in the world.
“Our customers highly value the fact that Ingeteam is able to offer a complete package of products and services, which not only includes the PV inverters and transformer substations with all the low- and medium-voltage equipment, but also the power plant controller (PPC) system, the SCADA, the equipment commissioning work and the operation and maintenance service.”
Gutiérrez said the service division had already secured its first contract to provide operation and maintenance services at two solar PV power plants. While the company did not identify the facilities, it did reveal they have power ratings of 85 MW and 75 MW respectively and were commissioned in December 2017.
Ingeteam has been active in Australia since 2013 and since then has established itself as the second largest supplier of PV inverters in the market with German manufacturer SMA continuing to lead the way.
SMA Australia project sales director Joshua Birmingham said in December the company had sold 1.6 GW of PV inverters in 2020 alone to claim a major share of the estimated 6.5 GW market.
“The renewable energy transition in the Australian market has been genuinely remarkable. Just five years ago, SMA supplied the first project of more than 10 MW into the Australian market; this year alone, we have closed 1.6 GW,” he said.
“SMA is proud to be leading Australia’s solar and renewable energy transition and remain at the global forefront of the decarbonisation of electricity generation.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/08/plico-energy-plans-expansion-after-4m-financial-injection/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 8, 2021",Plico Energy plans expansion after $4m financial injection,"The Perth-based Plico Energy announced on Friday it had secured a $2.4m strategic equity investment and a further $1.6m debt facility with the funds to be directed towards further growing its presence in the WA market.
The capital supplements a $50m infrastructure funding agreement signed in 2019 with Swiss-based investment firm SUSI Partners.
Plico Energy CEO Nuno Carneiro said the latest capital injection will be used for growth marketing initiatives.
“Plico has taken an iterative approach to rolling out our renewable solutions to date, allowing us to prove the technology, implementation process and savings potential,” he said.
“Having recently installed our 200th system in WA, we’ve now achieved good market penetration, been able to verify the disruptive model and have strong support, setting the stage for a significant growth phase for the company.
“Our mission is to provide consumers with far more control over their energy usage by creating virtual power plants (VPP) that operate behind the meter and this investment will be a significant part of the story in enabling that to occur.”
The retail arm of Starling Energy Group, Plico Energy entered the Australian renewable energy market in March 2019 with the launch of the Dunsborough Community Energy Project, the nation’s first privately funded VPP.
The company described the project as a community built, owned and managed renewable energy facility with the network of solar PV and battery systems to be centrally controlled and provided and installed for a flat fee.
At the time of the launch, a company spokesperson said the project would enable participating homeowners to generate and consume clean energy for up to 90% of their own needs, effectively ending heavy reliance on the traditional grid.
Pilco Energy customers pay a membership fee that covers the cost of the solar modules, in-home batteries and associated infrastructure. One of the company’s most popular packages, starting at $36.50 per week, comprises a 6.6 kW solar PV array, 5 Redback KVa inverter system and 7.2 KWh Pylontech (LiFePo4) battery. A larger system, comprising a 13.3 kW solar PV array, a 10 kVa inverter and a 14.2 kWh battery is priced from $69.50 per week.
In its marketing material published online, Plico Energy said the total cost of ownership of one of their systems over 25 years will be 50% of the current retailer contract.
Carneiro said the Pilco Energy approach allows people to create and consume their own solar power energy day and night and at the same time collectively build a grid-scale battery which can be used as a VPP, allowing more variable renewable energy to enter the grid.
The company’s initial target is 5000 homes with the latest capital injection to help finance the project.
The equity component of the latest capital raising was led by Euroz Hartleys and attracted support from existing shareholders and Westoz Funds Management (WFM) while Plico said a “major lender” had agreed to a $1.6m debt facility.
WFM executive director Dermot Woods said the Plico model was an exciting opportunity and a “win-win” solution for customers and governments alike.
“We are very excited about the potential for battery and solar micro-grid energy solutions and have been searching for an appropriate investment opportunity,” he said.
“We believe the Plico model provides a win-win solution for customers wanting affordable and reliable clean energy, and for state governments wishing to lower reliance on fossil fuels while maintaining a reliable transmission network.
“As investors, we believe there is huge growth potential for this sector as customer and government awareness and acceptance grows.”
