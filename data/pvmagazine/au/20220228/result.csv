Squadron said when complete, the proposed 1.2GW Clarke Creek wind and solar farm, being developed about 150 kilometres northwest of Rockhampton, would be the largest renewable energy precinct in the southern hemisphere.
The company said the project could produce enough wind, solar and battery energy to power more than 660,000 Queensland households and will export lower cost electricity directly into the National Electricity Market (NEM).
Forrest said the acquisition was a landmark moment for Australia’s green energy future.
“We have commenced construction of what will be the largest renewable energy precinct in the southern hemisphere – but I am delighted to say that we will not hold this record for long, with other renewable energy projects under development that will surpass our project in scale,” he said.
“We intend to bring on other projects which will be larger than today’s record.
The Clarke Creek project, originally developed by Lacour Energy and Goldwind, comprises an 800MW wind farm, up to 400MW of solar installations, and a battery energy storage facility of an as yet unspecified size although there have been reports Squadron is looking at installing up to 2GWh of battery storage at the site.

With grid connection, long-term supply agreements and all necessary state and federal approvals for Clarke Creek already in place, Squadron said it will now accelerate the start of construction with stage one anticipated to be fully operational in 2024. The company said stage two could come online in 2026.
“Due to its combination of solar, wind and battery technologies, it will help directly lower power prices for millions of Queensland households and businesses,” Squadron said.
Forrest said Clarke Creek’s grid-scale generation capability is expected to displace 2.7 million tonnes of carbon each year and aligns with the Queensland government’s integrated energy plan for the state.
“We are investing in Clarke Creek not only to harness the renewable power of the wind and sun to energise our homes, our factories and our cities, but as a critical step towards breaking our reliance on fossil fuels,” he said.
“Climate change is the single greatest threat to our existence, and we must meet this global challenge with tenacity and speed. This announcement is a signal that Australia is prepared to act with purpose to realise our 100%, green, renewable, zero-emissions energy future.”

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk welcomed the commitment from Squadron, saying the project would generate jobs and help the government achieve its renewable energy ambitions.
“Delivering such a huge renewable energy boost takes Queensland closer to achieving our targets of 50% renewable energy by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050,” she said.
Forrest said the development approval for the project had been secured in May 2018, federal environmental approval in November 2018 and grid connection approval earlier this year while a supply deal for most of the output of the first stage has also been secured.
In August 2020, the government-owned Stanwell Corporation and the state government announced a 346.5MW Power Purchase Agreement for the 450MW first stage of the Clarke Creek Wind Farm as part of a 15-year commitment to the project.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/28/im-an-all-pro-coal-plant-youll-never-be-more-than-a-replacement-player/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",,"FEBRUARY 28, 2022",“I’m an All-Pro [coal plant]… You’ll never be more than a replacement player!”,"There are a few ways to examine the lost capacity. The most interesting is not that the market will lose ~2GW of generation capacity over the evening peak, but that NSW is going to lose ~848MW of ramping capacity from Eraring (Liddell runs mostly flat, so its ramping loss is only ~88MW). Currently, NSW coal generators ramp up ~2GW of generation from their midday lows at ~12/1pm to the evening peak at ~6/7pm.
Eraring currently accounts for 42% of this ramp. If the other coal generators – Bayswater, Vales Point, and Mount Piper – take on most, if not all, of the ramping responsibility, this will push these units above 87% capacity on average over the evening peak (where they are currently only averaging ~68%) pushing these units close to the edge of their operational limits. Assuming each of those would be available for up to 90% of their nameplate during the evening peak, there is enough spare coal capacity to cover Eraring’s average generation loss. But to cover Eraring’s 95th percentile of generation over the evening peak (over the 5:30pm-11pm period), coal alone would be insufficient where an additional 122-513MW of capacity would be needed. Tallawarra and Tumut are the only dispatchable units that could shoulder this ramping responsibility but need to see higher prices over the should periods to incentivise additional generation. The squeeze over the ramping period is not only going to put a strain on coal generators to ramp more heavily, but it is likely to create a squeeze in raise regulation FCAS markets, which is heavily linked to energy prices and the availability of ramping capacity.
So, assuming that the whole generation loss is not covered by coal alone and that coal only ramps up an additional 20% of its current generation, new capacity will be needed to fill the generation gap. Interestingly, the wind profile in northern NSW Tablelands follows a very similar profile to the current Eraring coal generation profile. Admittedly the REZ is unlikely to have the needed increase in hosting capacity in time, but this may be the impetus needed to push this development more quickly, especially since this transmission augmentation is now an Actionable ISP Project.
Two different mechanisms could be used for estimating the required capacity buildout needed to cover Eraring’s exit: (1) pure least cost of technologies to satisfy the generation profile; or (2) the maximum profit (i.e. market efficient) of the technologies to satisfy the profile.
We would only need around 230MW of solar and 3,714MW of wind on a least-cost basis. Based on our current forecast build-out, this would mean no accelerated or additional development of solar (as the current forecast build is sufficient), but an additional (or accelerated development) of 2,850MW of wind would be needed. To satisfy a 75th of Eraring generation profile, it would require an additional 450MW of solar and 3,090MW of wind.
On a profit basis, to satisfy a 75th percentile Eraring profile, we wouldn’t need additional solar (as only 319MW would be required), but an additional ~3,196MW of wind would be needed. The need for storage is only seen when we need to cover a 95th percentile Eraring generation profile. In the 95th percentile case, we could expect an additional 4,055 of wind, which leaves us ~395MW short of the required capacity over the evening peak (If we assume a wind profile more akin to the Southern Tablelands rather than the Northern Tablelands, the wind needed is 3,897MW and short capacity is only 189MW). From our storage model, we have an indicative storage profile for the evening peaks, which suggests that if storage was used to satisfy those peaks, then an additional ~737MW of storage would be needed to cover that gap (which is not too far off the capacity of the 700MW battery proposed for the Eraring site) on the Southern Tablelands profile only 353MW of storage would be needed. However, given the commitment of the 660MW Kurri Kurri gas plant, this may easily be covered by this peaking asset in the future. In reality, these 95th percentile generation events are due to uncommon contingency events, so if we were only to plan for covering generation at a 75th percentile of Eraring generation but meeting a 95th percentile peak with storage, this number is far larger and closer to 1,112MW of storage.
Either way, it appears there is a significant need for further wind generation in the next few years and potentially some additional storage to assist in covering the evening peaks, however with the federal government stepping into the market with Kurri Kurri and the NSW proposing a 700MW battery the potential shortfall over the peak could be well and truly covered.
The full impacts of Eraring’s exit on pricing and the NEM’s capacity build-out will be outlined in our Benchmark Power Curve release in the coming months.

Researchers at the RMIT University in Australia have developed a multi-objective optimisation (MOO) framework to maximise the life cycle energy (LCE) and life cycle cost (LCC) of different building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) products and applications that is claimed to offer the best BIPV envelope design alternatives at the conceptual stage.
“In recent years, the building sector across the world has shown increasing interest in placing PV on building façades and roofs by either closely integrating PV panels with conventional building materials or replacing them,” researcher Rebecca Yang told pv magazine. “The interests are driven by electrification and decarbonisation of the built environment, growing demand for self-consumption, and the need for architecturally ‘good’ integration of PV, as well as technological innovations in PV materials and systems leading to better design options and feasibilities in the adoption.”
According to her, the enthusiasm of the downstream value chain stimulates upstream advances and opens dialogues between the solar industry and building professionals. Leading PV manufacturers have started to collaborate with major building entities aiming for mass production and customisation for massive application potentials on building facades, roofs and shading devices of new developments as well as renovations. “In Australia, I observed that many large property developers, leading design and engineering firms and local councils are very interested to apply BIPV, but the market is still not open yet due to some issues which are common in other similar countries,” she also explained.
In the paper A multi-objective optimisation framework for building-integrated PV envelope design balancing energy and cost, recently published in the Journal of Cleaner Production, Yang and her colleagues explained that the design variables for a BIPV envelope optimisation model are related to either the building envelope or the operational setting of the building. “A set of envelope design features, as well as PV-related features such as tilt angle, window-to-wall ratio (WWR), PV placement and PV product type, are included as design variables in the framework,” they pointed out, noting that the proposed module includes objective functions and constraints such as the net present value and the payback period. “The selected design variable set for each optimisation scenario may vary according to the selected BIPV application type or inputted user preferences.”
After applying the model to several business cases, the scientists concluded that there is no best alternative design or, better, that the ideal design can only be found when all user preferences are considered. “The study provides BIPV designers and building professionals with a method to produce and compare different BIPV designs based on their preferred application types, design preferences and criteria,” they stated.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/28/polysilicon-price-fluctuations-expected-to-continue-until-late-2023/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 28, 2022",Polysilicon price fluctuations expected to continue until late 2023,"From pv magazine Global
Polysilicon prices have been rising significantly since February 2021 and reached unprecedented levels over the past four months, with the average selling price peaking in December at $38/kg without VAT.
“Polysilicon prices are surprisingly high at the moment, despite the fact that polysilicon production in China has increased during the first two months of 2022,” Alex Barrows, research director at UK-based market research company Exawatt, told pv magazine. “The increase in production was a little lower than we had expected, and what we hadn’t seen coming is a very high demand for polysilicon that is a little unusual for the first quarter of the year, which traditionally can be a relatively weak quarter for the polysilicon industry.”
According to another polysilicon specialist, Johannes Bernreuter of Bernreuter Research, the ramp-up of new polysilicon production capacities of Chinese producers such as Tongwei, Daqo and GCL-Poly has been slower than expected, while demand is still growing faster than supply. “Concluding from the latest weekly reports of the price data providers, however, buyers seem to become more reluctant in view of the rising prices,” he told pv magazine. “The situation may relax somewhat once the ramp-up has reached higher volumes and Xinte‘s 20,000 MT debottlenecking project goes online.”
Bernreuter added that, as long as demand will remain strong, suppliers won’t have any reason to make concessions on price. “When demand is higher than available capacity, the price is determined by the buyers’ willingness to pay. The market tested this willingness in 2021,” he emphasised.
Barrows explained that some signs of the current trend for prices and demand were already observed last year, when increasing prices were not followed by a drop in demand. “On the contrary, demand stayed high, especially in the second half of the year, and keeps being at unprecedented levels right now, which makes the future scenario very difficult to predict, even in the short term,” he stated. “We expect, however, that polysilicon prices may decline in the course of the year, to reach around $20/kg by the end of December. In the longer term, we expect that the global polysilicon industry will be able to meet total demand and by late 2023 there is likely to be overcapacity. Until then polysilicon prices may be subject to many fluctuations.”
Looking at late 2023 and through 2024, Barrows explained that much will depend on how gross margins for polysilicon manufacturers evolve and how electricity prices in China develop. “Gross margins should come down as new polysilicon capacity comes online, but electricity prices for some industrial users have increased recently in China,” he added. “If this trend continues it could push up costs for some polysilicon manufacturers, thereby pushing up prices. We currently expect poly prices to come back down to around $10/kg by the end of 2023, but this is reliant on electricity prices not increasing too aggressively.”
When asked if non-Chinese producers may help change the current scenario, Barrows said this will be unlikely, at least in the near term. “The planned capacity expansions during 2022 and 2023 are very much focused in China. We could see some capacity in India under the PLI scheme there, but probably not until 2024 or 2025. It’s also possible that we’ll see capacity additions in the USA if the proposed manufacturing incentives are introduced,” he concluded.
