Over a four-week period in July to August 2023, SkyLab directly compared the performance of a test cell fitted with ClearVue’s Gen-2 PV integrated glazing units (IGU) against a control cell, deployed with the  Building and Construction Authority’s (BCA) ’Greenmark Platinum’ certified double glazed low-e windows.

Compared to the control cell, ClearVue’s cooling energy usage was reduced by an average of 22.8% compared to the control cell; total building energy consumption was 6.1% lower; and in terms of thermal performance, its Gen-2 PV IGUs were up to 3.5°C cooler compared to control windows during daytime hours.
Moreover, the company said that when its “spandrel solution” was added to the façade glazing, the overall electrical energy consumption in the same setting can be reduced by 71%.
“BCA’s comprehensive testing program clearly shows the advantages our PV glazing technology provides – as both an energy generator and passive design solution,” ClearVue Chief Executive Officer, Martin Deil, said.
To recap, ClearVue has developed specialised glass technologies that preserve glass transparency while generating electricity. The integrated glazing units (IGU) feature PV cells around the edges of each unit. The units incorporate a nanoparticle interlayer and spectral-selective coating on the rear external surface which allow much of the light to pass through but redirects infrared and ultraviolet (UV) light to the edge of the IGU where it is harvested by solar cells.
In September, the company said it had confirmed the scalability and “commercial viability” of its second-generation integrated glazing units after a mass production run using a standard manufacturing line at a factory in China.

Western Australia has two major grids, one in the South which caters to the majority of the population, and another in the north, where the state’s booming mining industry is based.
The reforms seek to remove barriers to entry for renewable generators, reward the capabilities of battery storage and enable more responsive pricing and dispatch regimes. The reformed WEM will also be more competitive at matching real-time electricity demand with the lowest cost sources of generation, according to AEMO.
The changes are fairly technical, with a fact sheet on the reforms to be found here. Developed by an Energy Transformation Taskforce, consisting of AEMO, government agencies, industry and market participants, the reforms saw changes to around 80% of AEMO’s previous WEM systems, it said.
The overhaul was made because the state’s rules were no longer fit-for-purpose, AEMO’s Executive General Manager WA and Strategy, Kate Ryan, said.
“Only a decade ago, more than 90% of all electricity used in WA’s main power system was generated by burning coal and gas,” Ryan said. “Today, the wind and the sun account for around a third of our annual electricity supply, peaking at about 84%, at times.”
“AEMO’s significant reform package to the WEM lays the groundwork for an orderly transition to cleaner, more affordable and reliable electricity in the SWIS,” she added.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/03/600-mw-solar-farm-in-central-queensland-finally-secures-approval/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 3, 2023",600 MW solar farm in Central Queensland finally secures approval,"After being in the works for many years, the 600 MW Smoky Creek solar farm has been approved by Tanya Plibersek, the Federal Minister for the Environment and Water.
Located in Central Queensland roughly 75 kilometres south of Rockhampton and 40 kilometres north of Biloela, the solar farm is set to be installed on approximately 1,800 hectares previously cleared for cattle grazing.

In the Smoky Creek report that opened for public consultation earlier this year, the proposal said the project’s infrastructure would include battery storage – however no mention of batteries are made in the federal government’s approval announcement nor on Edify’s Smoky Creek website.
The project seems to have been in development for at least six years, with Solar Quotes pointing to a report on the project for the Department of the Environment and Energy dated June 2017.
It had received final planning approval a number of years back and had support of the local Banana Shire Council, but was waiting to for the final tick under the Commonwealth’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation or EPBC Act.
That has now been given, with Smoky Creek expected to generate roughly 1.2 GWh per annum of renewable energy – enough to power more than 200,000 households.
According to Plibersek, Edify is planning for “at least” half of jobs and procurement associated with the project to be filled locally.
Smoky Creek will feed into the Powerlink Queensland Calvale to Stanwell 275 kV transmission lines, Edify says.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/03/japanese-owned-204-mw-solar-park-commissioned-in-queensland/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,JAPAN,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 3, 2023",Japanese-owned 204 MW solar park commissioned in Queensland,"After construction began in June 2021, the 204 MW (DC) Edenvale Solar Park celebrated reaching its rated power output late last week. Japanese oil giant Eneos Corporation and trading company Sojitz Corporation each own a 50% stake in the Edenvale solar project, which will supply a portion of its energy to Queensland’s Gregory Crinum coking coal mine, owned an operated by Sojitz.
The Edendale Solar Park sits on approximately 428 hectares near Chinchilla, around 300 kilometres west of Brisbane. The project has deployed roughly 400,000 solar panels and was constructed by Spanish-headquartered Gransolar, which is believed to also hold its operation and maintenance contract.

In the joint Eneos and Sojitz announcement, the pair say “Edenvale represents the largest solar project in Australia to be undertaken by Japanese companies.”
Back in 2021, when construction on the project began, the partners said Edenvale would sell 70% of its output to “a local electricity retailer at a fixed price” while the remaining 30% would be supplied to Sojitz’ nearby Gregory Crinum coal mine. In the latest release, the numbers are not so definite, with the announcement simply saying “a portion of the energy produced” would go to Gregory Crinum coal mine. Sojitz has had a long involvement with Queensland’s mining industry.
The project marks Eneos’ first solar project in Australia, and earlier this year the company opened a green hydrogen demonstration plant at Bulwer Island in Brisbane. The scale of the project is relatively small, producing just 20 kilograms of green hydrogen a day, but it is part of Eneos’ broader strategy to establish a green hydrogen supply chain in Australia and eventually begin exporting to Japan. 
“To establish the supply chain, Eneos continues to gain expertise in renewable energy development in Australia,” the company said, pointing back to Edendale as part of this approach.

Edendale was initially developed by Singapore-based DPI Solar 3, but DPI’s stake was bought by Eneos in 2021 via its joint venture holding company with Sojitz, Sapphire Energy Pty Ltd.
Edendale is connected the transmission grid via Powerlink’s existing Orana substation within the Southern Queensland Renewable Energy Zone.

Our green hydrogen is going to be the cheapest in the world because our cost of renewable energy production is the cheapest in the world,” said power minister RK Singh while addressing the India Energy Transition Summit 2023 recently in New Delhi. 
The minister said the cost of setting up 1 MW of renewable energy capacity in India is USD 600,000 ($935,000).
The minister said the government is going to come out with bids for round-the-clock renewable power using green hydrogen as storage.
“We estimate that the cost of round-the-clock renewable power using green hydrogen as storage would not be more than INR 6 [$0.11]/kWh. Once that price comes down, India’s entire transition will be round-the-clock renewable energy.” 
“India has already set green hydrogen standards. The government has stipulated that carbon emissions in the making of green hydrogen end-to-end should not exceed 2 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent for every kilogram of hydrogen produced [taken as an average over the last 12-month period]. That’s the best green hydrogen standard in the world,” said the minister.
The minister reaffirmed the government’s focus on making India the biggest manufacturer of the latest solar cells and modules. “The government wants only state-of-the-art solar cell and module production [in India]. The nation will continue to expand its manufacturing capacity with the best technology in the world,” he added.
“India already has 28 GW of PV module manufacturing capacity. Another 48 GW is coming up under the PLI scheme, out of which 24 GW is polysilicon-to-modules and the remaining 24 GW is wafer-to-module and cell-and-module. Outside of the PLI Scheme, the industry is setting up huge capacity, so the total manufacturing capacity which is in the process of being set up is about 100 GW.”
“That has happened because we are the biggest and the fastest growing renewable energy market in the world, and we shall continue to be so and we want to make it happen with made-in-India products,” said the minister.
The minister underlined that India’s current non-fossil capacity stands at an impressive 188 GW, with an additional 88 GW already under installation. “We pledged to reach 500 gigawatts by 2030, and we are set to achieve that goal well in advance,” he added. 
The minister noted that despite constituting 17% of the world’s population, India contributes only 4% to the global carbon dioxide emissions. He emphasised that India’s per capita emissions are around 2.2 tonnes, significantly lower than the global average of 6.3 tonnes. 
Speaking on the occasion, Bhupinder Singh Bhalla, Secretary at the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, said, “Last year, we achieved a renewable energy capacity addition of 15 GW. This year, we are targeting an increase to 25 GW, with plans to escalate it further to 40 GW next year.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/03/solar-wafer-prices-fall-for-first-time-in-3-months/,"FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"OCTOBER 3, 2023",Solar wafer prices fall for first time in 3 months,"From pv magazine Global
Solar wafer prices declined this week. This is the first time this quarter that wafer prices have decreased across the board.
The price of Mono M10 wafers dropped by 7.79% to USD 0.379 per piece (pc), while the price of Mono G12 wafers fell by 5.43% to USD 0.505/pc when compared to the previous week.
Wafer prices have decreased earlier than anticipated, multiple industry sources claimed. The increase in wafer output has outpaced demand to an excessive degree, which is the primary reason that has pushed wafer prices downwards, they concurred.

After the two leading wafer producers, Longi and TCL Zhonghuan dropped their list pricing for Mono M10 wafers to CNY3.1/pc in succession on September 25 and 26, an influential Tier-2 specialised wafer manufacturer reportedly offered Mono M10 wafers for CNY3.05/pc, according to a source.
This source stated that the market price will probably approach the price of this producer, adding that “this manufacturer has a certain market pricing power due to the expansion of production capacity; its newly expanded 40 GW wafer production capacity is currently being installed with manufacturing equipment on site.”
For another source, wafer inventory levels right now are still under control. However, because wafer prices are declining, wafer producers are concerned that, as they create more wafers, future wafer price declines may cause them to lose more money, the source said.
“However, this loss seems inevitable given that cell manufacturers have curtailed their wafer orders out of concern that wafer prices would continue to fall. Wafer stockpiles would build up as a result,” the source continued.
Looking ahead, the degree of the drop in wafer pricing may largely depend on the manufacturing strategies of cell makers and their enthusiasm for buying wafers, a source stated.
