The total project capacity will be 80 MWac with most of the facilities to be developed in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. Six of projects have already reached settlement phase.
GGE said in a statement that after completion of the development plan for the project, it will produce at least 180 GWh of emission-free, clean renewable energy annually which can supply power to 25,000 households and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 140,000 tonnes.
Risen said the projects were an important part of the company’s strategy in Australia, with plans to invest in renewable energy projects with an accumulated capacity in excess of 2 GW and to expand into the energy storage sector.
“We are steadily growing our solar projects and solar module supply businesses in Australia, and we see a bright future ahead as Australia continues to expand its renewable energy market,” Risen Australia vice general manager John Zhong said.
“Risen Energy has a long-term plan to be a major independent renewable power producer within Australia.”
Risen has already taken steps to achieve its ambitious plans, adding the 120 MW Yarranlea Solar Farm in Queensland and the 132 MW Merredin Solar Farm in Western Australia to its portfolio.
Risen last month signed a 10-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with BHP for its Merredin Solar Farm to supply up to 50% of electricity needs at BHP’s Nickel West Kwinana refinery.
The latest deal adds to a busy schedule for GGE which late last year announced plans for the 185 MW Australia Plains and the 120 MW Morgan solar farms in South Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/18/federal-mp-calls-for-breaks-as-victoria-drives-ahead-with-electric-vehicle-tax/,"EV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 18, 2021",Federal MP calls for breaks as Victoria drives ahead with electric vehicle tax,"Victorian Treasurer Tim Pallas has confirmed the State Government will introduce legislation into Parliament for its controversial new EV tax, his announcement coming less than 48 hours after Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman called on the Federal Government to cut its luxury car tax for low-emission vehicles and for states to offer lower registration charges for EVs in a bid to accelerate the transition away from internal combustion engines.
“If we are to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, which surely must become our goal, it must be a focus of our work,” Zimmerman told Parliament on Monday, adding that 19% of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions come from the transport sector.
“We need to adopt the goal of reaching close to 100% electric or other low-emission vehicles in the new-car market by the mid 2030s.”
Zimmerman said it is absolutely vital government supports the transition to EVs and called for a unified approach, saying state and territory governments must look at measures like lower registration and stamp duty and even toll relief for EVs.
“We should be open to these approaches in Australia,” he said. “At the federal level, it is time we removed the luxury car tax entirely from low-emission vehicles.
“You do need co-ordination (from states and territories). They have the capacity to provide incentives, through their registration and tolling systems, and even stamp duty. And on the flip side… as we’ve seen from Victoria, they also have the capacity to interrupt what we’d hope would be a natural progression for EVs.”
Zimmerman’s highlighting of Victoria’s proposed EV tax had little if any effect on the State Government with Pallas on Wednesday reaffirming plans to introduce a distance-based charge for all Victorian-registered zero- and low-emission vehicles from July 1 2021.

A 2.5 cent/km charge will apply to electric and other zero-emission vehicles, including hydrogen vehicles, and a 2.0 cent/km charge would apply to plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles.
Pallas said on average, EV owners will pay an additional $330 a year in distance-based road usage charges and plug-in hybrid-EV owners will pay an additional $260 a year. This compares to almost $600 a year paid by the average internal combustion engine vehicle owner in fuel excise.
“These reforms ensure all motorists pay their fair share to use our roads while we continue to incentivise the use of zero or low emissions vehicles,” Pallas said.
“Introducing a road usage charge now, before take-up increases substantially, ensures that everybody pays a fair and sustainable charge for the use and the wear and tear on our road network and that means safer roads.”
Zimmerman however blasted the Victorian Government’s plan, labelling it a “disaster”.
“The Victorian approach is a disaster for encouraging motorists to buy an electric vehicle,” he said.
Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) chief executive Behyad Jafari echoed Zimmerman’s stance, saying the Victorian Government’s move was particularly baffling.
“Victoria is now doing what no other jurisdiction on earth does by discouraging people from buying electric vehicles by slugging them with a special tax,” he said.
“The rest of the developed world is doing everything possible to encourage the uptake of electric cars, but Mr Pallas reckons it’s time to slam the brakes on in Victoria.
“You don’t need to be much of an economist to know that if you whack a big new tax on something you discourage its use.”

Figures provided by the EVC show Australian EV sales are stagnating at a time when the rest of the world is hitting the accelerator hard.
Just 6,900 EVs sold in Australia in 2020, an increase of about 200, or 2.7% on the previous year. That compares with a 43% surge in EV sales globally to 3.2 million.
EVs make up 4.2%, or 134,400, of all cars sold worldwide. In Australia, they account for a mere 0.7% of the 1 million cars sold annually.
By comparison, EVs in the EU increased their market share from 3.8% in 2019 to 10.2% in 2020. In the the UK, it was 3.1% in 2019 against 10.7% in 2020 and in Norway, it rose from 56% in 2019 to 75% in 2020.
“Australian drivers are ready to join the exciting global electric car transition, but our politicians are yanking the handbrake,” Jafari said.
“There’s simply no sugarcoating it at this point – Australia has marked itself out as a uniquely hostile market to electric vehicles.
“We have no targets, no significant incentives, no fuel efficiency standards – and in Victoria we even have a new tax on non-emitting vehicles.
“Our governments are apparently doing everything possible to ensure Australia is stalled with its hazards on while the rest of the world zooms into the horizon.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/18/south-australian-rooftop-solar-switched-off-in-search-for-stability/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 18, 2021",South Australian rooftop solar switched off in search for stability,"AEMO said transmission authorities in South Australia had remotely switched off more than 10,000 rooftop solar systems and almost 30 MW of large-scale solar PV on Sunday afternoon with the state experiencing “near-record minimum demand levels for electricity from the grid” due in part to mild weather conditions, low energy needs from industry and large volumes of surplus electricity from rooftop solar passively feeding into the power system
Australia’s rapid uptake of rooftop and large-scale solar has delivered periods of very low demand, prompting the South Australian Government to last year introduce an initiative which provides transmission authorities with permission to restrict solar PV output as a way of mitigating the threat to the security of the National Electricity Market (NEM). Sunday was the first time the restrictions had been enacted.
With the Heywood interconnector, which links the state’s grid with Victoria, undergoing maintenance and scheduled demand forecast to dip to 400 MW, AEMO instructed transmission company ElectraNet to “maintain grid demand above 400 MW” for one hour during the afternoon.
“On Sunday, South Australia experienced near-record minimum demand levels for electricity from the grid,” an AEMO spokesperson said, confirming minimum operational demand had fallen to 358 MW, just shy of the 300 MW record set on October 11, 2020.
“At the same time, a planned outage of the circuits feeding the Heywood interconnector was taking place.
“To preserve system security in South Australia, AEMO maintained the minimum amount of synchronous generation to maintain system security.
“AEMO also needed to then direct ElectraNet to maintain grid demand above 400 MW from 3pm local time for one hour.”

This resulted in ElectraNet curtailing a range of larger distribution-connected and residential solar customers, including those through the South Australian Government’s ‘Smarter Homes’ initiatives which mandates all new small business and residential solar PV installations must assign an agent to curtail generation in rare events threatening the security of the NEM.
About 10 MW of distributed solar PV was removed that way for the first time by electricity distributor South Australia Power Networks (SAPN) through registered agents.
Another 40 MW of rooftop solar PV was curtailed through SAPN’s enhanced voltage management system at seven substations and an estimated 17 MW of commercial solar PV was cut off through Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) control systems.
AEMO said the ability to manage large-scale and residential solar customers is vital to support the ongoing transition to a renewable power system and warned system security concerns due to minimum operational demand are likely to become more common..
“Minimum demand events will become increasingly common throughout Australia as we continue to integrate rooftop PV installations,” the spokesperson said.
AEMO said it has been and continues to work with governments, government agencies, market bodies and consumers to support the development of a range of measures that seeks to enable greater amounts of renewable energy in the NEM and maximise consumer benefits.
This includes establishing Australia’s first distributed energy resources (DER) register, conducting engineering studies, trials and modelling to effectively integrate DER, and enhance inverter standards, market reforms and regulations.
In addition, AEMO said it is contributing to the Energy Security Board’s (ESB) post 2025 energy reforms, aimed at progressing a modern regulatory structure which will better support innovative market response to these situations.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/18/qa-eews-500-million-gladstone-solar-to-hydrogen-project-is-just-the-start/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,JAPAN,QUEENSLAND",BLAKE MATICH,"MARCH 18, 2021",Q&A: EEW’s $500 million Gladstone solar to hydrogen project is just the start,"pv magazine Australia: Australia is the testing ground for a lot of different aspects of the future green hydrogen market. And one of the experiments we’re seeing between the various projects is the economics of solar and wind versus solar and storage for hydrogen production. So why is EEW going the solar plus storage route in its Gladstone Project?
Svante Kumlin, CEO Eco Energy World: You’re right, we’re planning substantial storage in our project. So we charge at peak and during the night as well. But you need a lot of battery, and it depends how long you run the hydrogen plant. But we will have at least 100 MW of storage in this plant. We might go bigger. And we can, as you say, use some other resource such as wind via a PPA during the night to run the plant and charge the battery.
And is your plan to produce green hydrogen for export or convert it first to ammonia or some similarly transportable product?
SK:  Yes, we initially plan to produce green hydrogen for export. As we see the export market take-off, especially in Japan, conversion really depends on the means of transport. As you say, conversion to ammonia is one method but hydrogen can also be compressed or liquified.
And how will you transport the green hydrogen from Queensland to Japan?
SK: Transporting hydrogen is difficult, but that’s why the project is located where it is, because the product needs to be shipped north. Gladstone Port is one of these ports in Australia identified to be ideal for these kinds of exports. And of course there are other players there too, Sumitomo for example although they’re not completely green. But personally I also hope the Australian domestic market will develop a demand for green hydrogen locally. I think it would make a lot of sense but it’s not there now. But what I see as a really big market going forward is on heavy transport, fuel cells. And I also see a market in the mining industry where gensets and backup solutions are expensive and dirty. There is quite a bit of interest in converting all that power into hydrogen solutions, and it is just a matter of how quickly that is going to happen. Today, the market in Australia is for export but I do believe the local market will develop and we are seeing a lot of interest.
Image: EEW
We certainly have the solutions, for instance, for the mining industry, it’s just whether the industry is able to pool together to develop the kind of infrastructure necessary for decarbonisation.
SK: There is quite a lot of interest from certain financing groups to actually go in and finance all these mining companies for the transition. We have been approached by some of them already. So, if you just have the hydrogen then you will see that taking place because it makes economic sense. When they can make money from it, or become greener without losing anything they’ll do it. But they won’t do it if they lose anything.
Well let’s move back to the export market. Transporting green hydrogen is still incredibly expensive, how can you economically transport green hydrogen to north Asia?
SK: Well, there are shipping solutions for it and we’re discussing with shipping companies. Of course, our project is planned to come into production in the last quarter of 2023. While at the moment the transport cost is the same as the cost of producing the hydrogen, we have a pricing outlook for 2024-2030 and that outlook shows us still hitting our marks despite the transport costs.
I’ve been in the solar business for 12-13 years. When I started 1 MW of solar had a CAPEX of €6 million, today the same megawatt is €400,000, and I believe that hydrogen will have a similar ride. In the beginning you have 20% decrease per year in the CAPEX, and then it levels out at 10%, but you will see dramatic falling of CAPEX. So we are seeing and targeting a hydrogen price for 2023 that is doable for export to Japan, otherwise there’s no business.
For the shipping solutions, I will say that sooner or later there will be more special tonnage built. And there is a lot of interest in that, not just from the buyers but also the shipping companies because they see that they have to convert. Indeed those latter companies themselves are big polluters so they have to provide these solutions by way of offsetting their own carbon as well.
By 2023-24 we believe the price will be between $4-5 per kilo in Japan. 2030 we’re looking more at $3. And I would say half of that is transport cost and half production. Meaning that by 2024 we will need to be producing green hydrogen at a price around $2.
And can this Gladstone project reach that price or will an additional power source through the night be necessary?
SK: Yes, you need to have a longer producer cycle, meaning you need storage and you probably need a PPA with a wind farm as well. Otherwise you can’t utilise the production capacity to get down to that price so you’re right on that. And we are looking into such PPAs which are quite useful because most people aren’t buying wind power during the night so the prices are cheaper.
The problem then is not the price during the night, the problem is getting it from the right source. I think it’s very feasible. And that’s why it’s very beneficial coming in from the solar side, because you know all about the structure of the business, especially in Queensland and all of our projects have been in Queensland.
And the Queensland Government are very keen to encourage hydrogen hubs such as Gladstone?
SK: Yes the Government has contacted us and I can’t tell you much about that but the logistics of using the stuff that we need, the port and the pipelines, are an ongoing discussion, but there is enormous will from the Government to make it happen. And I can understand that because the coal exports will soon suffer and need replacement. Hydrogen is a perfect solution and we are excited to be involved in that.
You mentioned the end of 2023 as a production date, could you give me a timeline of the solar aspect of the project?
SK: The solar project itself is fully authorised and ready to build. We would probably aim for construction in 2022 concurrently with the hydrogen plant. With a soft date of connection in early 2023. But actually, we have been considering not connecting the solar farm to the grid because the grid is expensive. But at the end of the day, because we need to import energy, we would lose a lot of our flexibility if we weren’t connected. It might be that we don’t connect for export only for import, but we don’t save so much money on that because the connection itself in Australia is very expensive.
And often in terms of EPCs and other aspects we have to wait for AEMO and you know it has been hard with that, like working against a wall. It has felt that we are at a disadvantage compared with the base-load operators. But the Australian dollar is a bit stronger, system prices are falling, things are improving and our plan is to close on an EPC before the end of Q2.
Would you say it has been the falling storage prices that have allowed you to break through some of those walls?
SK: Well there has been a lot of delays in terms of the grid for the development of the solar. And Australia is more costly than other parts of the world. So we’ve been taking a lot of risks without the security of connection, but the things we’ve gone through have strengthened our plan. I would say the main thing is that the political climate has meant a lot of uncertainty for renewable energy developers, and now that that climate seems as if it is changing then the guidelines given to the regulators and how they deal with it is also changing, and that is very important.
Take Europe as a parallel. If you develop renewable energy in Europe you get priority to export that energy to the grid before any dirty generators. In Australia it is the opposite. Renewable generators have to pay a lot of different charges for connection and that system I hope is slowly going to change. Everyone knows the coal generators are going to be phased out so what is the point of keeping them alive to profit instead of the new ones who need to take over?
It’s just a money question. But the tide is turning. And that is going to influence construction because a lot of EPCs have been going out of the market in Australia. Which is making our life more difficult because we have fewer to negotiate with and the prices go up, or at least don’t go down. And that is because the contractor’s price perceives the risk and the risk of grid delays and uncertainty has been high for a number of years.
I guess that can be demoralising when the biggest concern as a project developer in the green hydrogen space is not getting the energy, or demand, or transport, but grid uncertainty.
SK: I know, I know. That’s why hydrogen is a great thing, but still we have to connect because we need to import. Otherwise we could be off-grid.
Of course, in another way, since we are not planning on exporting much to the grid, and we only plan to import to the grid when there is too much energy, such as during the night, so the access to the grid for projects such as ours should be much easier than for a full grid-export solar power plant.
Why should you play by the same rules as someone exporting to the grid when you’re exporting to North Asia?
SK: Yes I think that is going to be the case. And I think it is also important to say that after building this first project we will keep building capacity because we have to. Because prices are going to be going down, and the next plant is a lower CAPEX. For instance, if you have a CAPEX of $1 million, and then $750,000, and then $500,000, but then the price of the hydrogen is falling as well. So we’re not announcing anything on that front yet but we will be looking to expand our production.
Where we are now we are 20km from the port, 20km from the pipeline, that is important. So we would look to expand in the Raglan area and maybe somewhere else in Australia.  And I would say that by 2030 we’d be looking at having 1 GW of production facilities. That is our grand plan, but only this first project has been announced.
And could you talk a bit about financing for the project?
SK: On the financing side, the way we see the project being financing is by a blend of debt and equity. The R&D work might get a little bit of help, but we don’t’ want to rely on grants and things like that because you’ll end up getting delayed in order to write some report to someone or other in order to apply for funding. We’re not going to do that. I know a lot of Australian groups are doing that, they wouldn’t go ahead if they didn’t get the grants. We’re not going to do that. If we get grants for anything, great, but we’re not going to be hostage to that.
Time is of the essence.
SK: Yes, and our project is based on sound commercial facts. It doesn’t need to be subsidised because it’s not the way we do business. I believe that this first of our hydrogen projects will be funded with equity but perhaps traditional banks will help finance our second project. But it’s fair to say the equity component will be at least 50% on the hydrogen part. On the solar part it is not a problem because solar is very bankable.
And am I right in thinking you had the solar plant planned out first and have tagged idea for hydrogen came later?
SK: Yes, we started thinking about hydrogen in 2017. We thought hydrogen would be a great way of storing energy. But then you produce the hydrogen, store it somewhere, and then you put it into a fuel cell or a turbine and export it again. That was too expensive and you lose energy in all this. That’s how we started. But then the CAPEX prices of electrolysers and equipment started to come down, and it started to make more sense.
For us we see it as a great advantage coming from solar because electricity is the biggest cost factor. If you don’t have cheap energy it’s not going to work, and that’s what you have in Australia with solar during the day and wind underutilised during the night.

The scarcity of development sites in Japan means rooftop solar will play a key role if the nation is to achieve its aim of carbon-neutrality by mid century.
With solar at the heart of Japan’s energy transition, according to a paper commissioned by domestic thinktank the Renewable Energy Institute, more than a third of the 524 GW of solar generation capacity needed by 2045 would be installed on urban rooftops.
The scale of the challenge is represented by the fact researchers from Finland’s LUT University; the Japanese thinktank; and German peer Agora Energiewende insisted Japan would have to install the maximum volume of solar project capacity possible, occupying 1.3% of the total free land area available today with utility scale PV plants.
The route to net zero by mid century will require Japan to raise the 18% of its energy mix accounted for by renewables in 2019 to at least 40% by 2030, helping drive a 45% fall in the volume of greenhouse gas emissions at that date–compared with 2010 figures–and a 90% reduction by 2045, at which point imported synthetic hydrogen and methane could complete the goal in the hardest-to-decarbonise industrial sectors.
Japan is not as far down the emissions reduction track as the EU and, with its power sector still offering the biggest carbon saving potential, the authors of the Renewable pathways to climate-neutral Japan study suggested 8.4 GW of solar should be installed annually, to hit 144 GW this decade, including 70 GW of household systems, up from 23 GW last year. Japan added more solar annually–8.5 GW–in the 2014-19 period.
If that new solar target sounds achievable, the requirements of 2031-45 modelled by the researchers called for 25 GW of new solar each year, to attain that 524 GW figure.
Photovoltaics are slated to be the energy transition workhorse based on an expectation the cost of generating solar electricity will fall to an average ¥3.90/kWh ($0.036) by 2050. The ¥17.4 trillion ($159 billion) annual cost of the energy system modelled would be significantly lower than the current ¥24.7 trillion and a renewable energy mix would see only ¥3.8 trillion ($34.8 billion) spent on imports–of synthetic fuels–compared to the ¥17 trillion lavished on fossil fuel imports today.
With governments around the world being urged to formulate green hydrogen strategies, the Renewable Energy Institute-commissioned paper is notable for emphasising the energy needs of Japan should steer the nation towards the electrification of sectors such as heating, transport and most of its industry, and should keep hydrogen use to a minimum. According to the authors, the wind power capacity required to fuel the domestic production of green hydrogen would place too great a strain on the energy system, so the sustainable gas should be imported and used only in the few sectors where it would constitute the only alternative to fossil fuel dependency.
The report’s authors suggest the Japanese government should enshrine its suggested renewables capacity mix figures into concrete climate change targets; phase out coal by 2030–with economics ensuring nuclear falls away by the same point; encourage rapid heat pump and electric vehicle adoption; and apply strict energy efficiency standards in its building codes.
