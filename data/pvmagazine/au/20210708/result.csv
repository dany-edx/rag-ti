https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/08/solarbattery-project-has-victorian-town-on-target-for-100-renewables/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 8, 2021",Solar+battery project has Victorian town on target for 100% renewables,"Totally Renewable Yackandandah’s (TRY) Community Battery project, which couples a 65 kW solar PV array and a 274 kW battery system, was officially unveiled on Thursday, edging the town closer to its community-based goal of reaching 100% renewables by 2022.
Delivered by TRY and the community owned energy company Indigo Power, the battery project – dubbed Yack 01 – is one of the first community-scale batteries in Australia. It is expected it will power up to 40 Yackandandah households.
“Yack01 is Yackandandah’s first piece of community-scale energy infrastructure and will supply power through the network to Indigo Power customers,” the TRY website reads.
“It is a pivotal first step and pilot for larger community-scale projects that will follow in our quest for 100% renewable energy.”
Indigo Power will own and operate the solar+battery facility with the tracking and sharing of local energy within the minigrid made possible by a widget developed by Mondo, an independent subsidiary of AusNet Services.
The community solar+battery project is one of two renewable energy initiatives unveiled in Yackandandah on Thursday.
The Twist Creek Microgrid, which saw solar modules, low-emission hot water services and batteries installed in nine Yackandandah homes, was also officially opened.
It is the latest of four microgrids connected into the electricity network, allowing for the trading and sharing of locally generated renewable energy.
The town is also home to a public virtual power plant (VPP), 10 public buildings hosting a combined total of 74.8 kW of solar modules and 36 kWh of battery storage.

Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change Lily D’Ambrosio said Yackandandah’s latest renewable projects further highlighted the power of community action.
“Totally Renewable Yackandandah and Indigo Power are setting a great example with their ambitious targets and work to get Yackandandah on 100% renewable energy by the end of next year,” she said.
“Projects like these show the community is keen to embrace renewables. This grassroots enthusiasm is so important as Victoria works to halve its emissions by 2030.”
In a bid to progress the roll out of renewables in communities across the state, D’Ambrosio announced on Thursday the state government will provide $6.5 million to expand the Community Power Hubs program and provide grants for community groups to install renewable energy and undertake energy audits.
The seven new hubs, which include one to be convened by Indigo Power in Yackandandah, will be set up in regions across the state, with each hub supporting community energy groups in their region by providing support, funding and local expertise.
The Hume Community Power Hub, to be convened by Indigo Power, will commence work immediately having already secured more than $70,000 in funding to install two rooftop solar systems totalling 144 kW.
The other hubs will be convened by Healesville Community Owned Renewable Energy, Yarra Energy Foundation based in Richmond, Ballarat Renewable Energy and Zero Emissions, Geelong Sustainability Group, Gippsland Climate Change Network and Bendigo Sustainability Group.
The hubs have been funded to immediately deliver 16 solar energy projects by the end of the year.
“These community-owned and operated hubs will bring local renewable energy projects to life, drive investment in regional Victoria, create jobs and reduce energy bills,” D’Ambrosio said.
“These Community Power Hubs – spread right across Victoria – will be a one-stop-shop for anyone after advice or ideas about how to get their business or community organisation more energy efficient.”
“This is all a part of our plan to halve emissions by 2030.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/08/custring-ready-to-pull-trigger-on-1-5-billion-transmission-project/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 8, 2021",CuString ready to ‘pull trigger’ on $1.5 billion transmission project,"CuString chairman John O’Brien announced on Wednesday the company would be ready to “pull the trigger” on the $1.5 billion high-voltage transmission line set to run between Mt Isa and Townsville in north Queensland (QLD) in October, pending final government approvals.
O’Brien told a Regional Reference Group meeting in Townsville the company was looking to finalise funding arrangements with the federal and state governments and complete a study into the project’s potential to support the development of a “clean industrial ecosystem” across the Mt Isa to Townsville corridor and the North West Minerals Province.
“With the support of the Queensland and Australian governments, who are critical to orchestrate the growth of Northern Queensland’s clean industrial economy, we will be ready to pull the trigger on our open access, game-changing infrastructure and commence construction before the end of the year,” he said.
The project, which received an $11 million boost from the federal government recently and has secured more than $14.8 million from the state government, is being hailed as the nation’s largest geographical expansion of the NEM.
It would integrate Queensland’s isolated northwest power supply into the NEM and pave the way for the development of renewable energy projects, including large-scale wind and solar, in the region while also opening up access to large deposits of minerals seen as key to the energy transition.
“CopperString will extend the national transmission grid through an open access 1,100km power network which will not only create greater energy security, it will power the growth of new opportunities for mining, industrial and manufacturing enterprises as well as support clean energy projects,” O’Brien said.
Sydney-based Vast Solar is among those who have already identified QLD’s northwest for investment with plans to develop a $600 million hybrid power plant in Mount Isa.
The project will combine solar PV, a large-scale battery and gas engines with a 50 MW solar thermal facility and help the Queensland government build out its Northern Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).
With the CopperString 2.0 project due for completion in 2024, CuString said it is looking to complete negotiations with the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) on its financing offer for the project and finalise relevant environmental approvals.
O’Brien said the Townsville-based company is also seeking to finalise the remaining items under the Implementation Agreement with the state government which has identified the project as part of its strategy to establish Queensland as a renewable and hydrogen superpower.
“The premier made it clear that developing the half a trillion dollars of critical minerals in the North West was the key to that ambition,” O’Brien said.
“The premier is expecting CopperString to power that ambition, and we can deliver.
“The CopperString corridor between Townsville and Mount Isa cuts through the heart of the best wind and solar resources in Queensland to fuel new renewable energy projects that will power the development of the minerals and electrify their processing in North Queensland.
“Greener, cleaner power harnessed by CopperString will also serve the creation of a world-leading hydrogen export hub in Townsville to lead the state’s decarbonisation.”
O’Brien said he expects announcements regarding procurement opportunities will be made in the coming weeks.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/08/agl-mothballs-gas-unit-with-work-set-to-start-on-big-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 8, 2021",AGL mothballs gas unit with work set to start on big battery,"AGL has informed the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) it intends to mothball the gas-fired Torrens B1 unit in October, a month after it mothballs the last of its Torrens ‘A’ units.
The energy giant said the continued decline in South Australian forward wholesale electricity prices and the volume of new wind and solar capacity entering the market has created challenging conditions that do not support the financial viability of operating all four units at the 800 MW B station.
The announcement signals the next step in AGL’s strategy to transition from traditional baseload energy generation to more flexible sources as it navigates the shift to renewable energy and follows last week’s announcement that the company will demerge into two separate listed entities next year to split its retail and baseload generation functions.
While the decision to mothball the B1 unit is the beginning of the end for the gas-fired facility, AGL chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said the Torrens Island site will remain a key part of its portfolio with a 250 MW one-hour duration grid-scale battery to be installed at the location on Adelaide’s north-western outskirts.
“Torrens Island continues to be an important site for our future generation plans, including its development as a low-carbon industrial energy hub of the future,” Brokhof said.
“Construction of our 250MW grid-scale battery is planned to begin later this year, making it the first of AGL’s planned 850 MW of batteries to get underway.
“This new grid-scale battery along with the Barker Inlet power station that commenced operations in 2019 demonstrates our commitment to playing a leadership role in the state’s energy transition.”
The Torrens Island big battery, which is expected to be fully operation by early 2023, had originally been slated as a four-hour-duration system but that is now being kept as an expansion plan.
Brokhof has previously said battery technology is key to enhancing the energy system’s flexibility while leading Australia’s energy transition and ongoing integration of renewables.

The Torrens Island battery is among a slew of energy storage plans AGL has in place.
AGL is also developing a 200 MW grid-scale battery at its Loy Yang power station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, a 150 MW battery at its Liddell power station and a 50 MW battery in Broken Hill in New South Wales as well as supporting grid-scale battery projects including Wandoan (100 MW) in Queensland and has announced plans to develop four 50 MW batteries in conjunction with energy group Maoneng in NSW. It is already operating the 30 MW/ 8 MWh BESS at Dalrymple in South Australia.
Brokhof said the decision to mothball the B1 unit was only made after careful consideration of reliable supply against the changes in capacity requirements and pricing.
“We will continue to provide South Australians with access to reliable and affordable electricity. We have assessed all publicly available information and are confident there is sufficient capacity available to AEMO to ensure system strength,” he said.
Based on the power station’s maintenance cycle, AGL says the B1 unit is the most appropriate to be mothballed and preserved for a potential recall, indicating the unit will take six months to bring back online should market conditions change.
AGL will continue to operate the remaining three 200 MW B units, along with the adjacent 210 MW gas-fired Barker Inlet power station and will review the decision should there be material changes to the market conditions.
AGL has already mothballed three of Torrens Island ‘A’ station’s four 120 MW generating units, with the remaining unit to be mothballed in September and retirement planned for September 2022.

Q Cells and Samsung have signed a “zero energy homes” deal under which they will combine their hardware and software platforms to provide comprehensive energy services, including generation, energy storage, power consumption, and intelligent energy management.
The “zero energy home” concept involves the efficient use of energy directly produced on-site to enable energy independence and reduce emissions. This is achieved via “active technology” –generation resources – and “passive technology,” or energy efficiency measures.
The role of Q Cells in the partnership will be to provide solar modules and energy storage systems (ESS) to customers, as well as its Q.ONNECT home energy management system. The platform features an optimised ESS operation service that uses expected charge amount data and local weather forecasts.
When linked to Samsung Electronics’ SmartThings platform, the data will give homeowners control to optimise home energy use. The platform can link to Samsung and non-Samsung devices for centralised appliance management. The service is intended to give homeowners a clearer view of how energy is consumed by heat pumps and appliances, letting them set up a more sustainable energy management plan.
In addition, the two companies plan to cooperate on joint sales, mainly in the U.S. and European markets.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/08/singapores-60-mw-floating-pv-array-up-and-running/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,SINGAPORE",BLAKE MATICH,"JULY 8, 2021",Singapore’s 60 MW floating PV array up and running,"Even though the market is set to double in 2021, floating PV (FPV) may still be seen as a niche by many countries around the world, but not Singapore. The city-state which is already home to the world’s largest offshore floating PV (OFPV) farm, as well as the world’s largest FPV testbed at the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), is now home to an operational 60 MW FPV array on Tengeh Reservoir. 
Sembcorp Floating Solar Singapore, a unit of utilities and marine group Sembcorp Industries, began construction on the system back in June 2020. Now the system’s 122,000 Trina Solar 210 Vertex dual-glass modules, which cover a surface area the size of 45 football fields, are in full commercial operation and delivering green energy from Singapore’s main reservoir of drinking water via a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Public Utilities Board (PUB), Singapore’s National Water Agency. The PPA will see approximately 7% of its energy demand provided by the FPV array. 
At the Virtual Leaders Summit on Climate held in April 2021 and convened by US President Joe Biden, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that in order for Singapore “to overcome our small size and lack of resources, and achieve our emission reduction goals, Singapore must also innovate and use technology extensively.” But Singapore is certainly not all talk, it can walk the walk, and more than that, it is doing its walking on water. 
The system will generate 77,259,302 kWh of clean electricity annually, enough to power 16,000 average Singaporean households and offsetting 32  kilotonnes of CO2 emissions, thereby ensuring that Singapore joins a select group of countries with 100% green waterworks. 
“The application of Trina Solar’s 210 Vertex modules in Singapore’s floating project has been a successful showcase,” said Zhao Lei, Trina Solar’s project leader in the China region. “After the Singapore project, more and more country markets show confidence and recognition of the quality of Trina Solar’s 210 Vertex modules. Our brand has earned its wider reputation overseas.” 
PUB said in an earlier statement that they sought double-glass PV modules like those supplied by Trina Solar because they needed to be durable enough to perform in wet and humid conditions for 25 years. The panels themselves are supported by food-grade quality high density polyethylene (HDPE) floats which are UV-resistant, a necessity to protect the floats from degradation. 
Singapore installed its first FPV system as a 1 MWp testbed on the Tengeh Reservoir in 2016. Now that large-scale FPV is now successfully in operation, Singapore will look to repeat the process across its many reservoirs and waters.
