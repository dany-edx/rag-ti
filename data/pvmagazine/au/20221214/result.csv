The vision is to assemble the iron-flow batteries designed by ESS here in Australia sourcing 80% of the components from within Queensland, primarily its regions, including manufacturing the electrolyte. The Maryborough plant is slated for operations from 2024, with targeted annual production capacity of 400 MW by 2026.
While politicians are pushing hard to see exactly this kind of movement, some in the industry have doubted whether Australia has the capacity to become a real player in battery manufacturing.
For Parry, it comes down to how we approach it. Flow batteries, especially ones leveraging iron – an exceedingly abundant material here in Australia – have a clear opportunity in his eyes.
“We are perfectly suited for this type of battery,” Parry tells pv magazine Australia. “[Flow battery technology] is nice because you just use what you’ve got hanging around.”

Crucially though, Parry says, making a flow battery isn’t about producing high tech cells, but rather building a whole system. “Flow is not leading edge – it’s pumps, pipes, electrolytes, membranes – it’s pretty simple.”
“People need to stop thinking about it like a cell and more of a mechanical piece.”
“This could be easily scaled here in Australia. What do we have to be able to do that? We have engineering, we have a whole series of engineering consultancies building large scale projects on budget with mining companies at mines. We could leverage off that knowledge, repackage that to suit Australia’s requirements and assemble those large-scale batteries to meet our regulations, our standards and our knowledge,” Parry says.
In other words,  the play for Parry is about leveraging Australia’s strengths and market needs, without getting caught up trying to reinvent the wheel.

While iron flow batteries date back to the 1970s, the technology hasn’t been widely deployed in Australia – primarily because like all other forms of large-scale energy storage, it wasn’t really necessary in a dispatchable fossil-fuel driven electricity system. 
To the end of assuaging those technology concerns, ESI has just delivered the first large-scale iron-flow battery to the National Battery Testing Centre in Brisbane’s Banyo. The independent facility will soon set about testing the battery, manufactured by ESS, to demonstrate its capabilities, and hopefully lend credibility to the systems ESI is hoping to rollout across the country.
Putting aside the companies problematically similar acronym titles, ESS CEO Eric Dresselhuys describes his company’s partnership with ESI as revolving around technology. That is, ESI is in charge of leading the conversations and rollout in Australia, while ESS support with the technology.

It will do that in the form of its design and intellectual property, and also by providing the remaining 20% of core components ESI can’t source in Australia. (Though Parry seems to suggest in the longer term he’d like to see more of this done in Australia.)
This US–Australian company union speaks to a greater movement of “friendshoring” – forming supply chain alliances between politically allied countries, Dresselhuys points out.
As mentioned, flow battery technology is hardly new. This fact is something Parry believes really works in its favour. “The electricity industry does not like the leading edge at all,” he says, but rather wants decades of testing and basically “risk free” options. “That’s the biggest barrier – comfort,” Parry says.
A hard box to tick in this day and age, ESS – a decade old company – comes decently close, with  pilots up and running for over five year in the states. “We’re certainly the furthest ahead in terms of maturity,” Dresselhuys tells pv magazine Australia. Rather than being unique in its concept, ESS’ uniqueness comes in its commercial availability and scale.

This was enough to catch the attention of renewables investor Sword and Stone Capital Management, from which ESI is an offshoot, sharing much of the same executive team. That team reportedly spent four years investigating storage technologies across the world, and ended up convinced ESS had the most promising offering – especially given ESI’s interest in manufacturing in Australia. 
“[ESS has] firming technologies which can be assembled quickly, easily and simply utilising existing techniques and that’s why I went down this road with ESS,” Parry says.
“These batteries are very different. It meets our strengths here in Australia,” he adds.
This idea of meeting strengths is at the heart of ESI’s play. “It’s important to leverage existing skills and knowledge.”
“We’re utilising existing supply chains,” Parry says. “We already have pumps, pipes. Steel we already do. We also have quite innovative pre-made steel structures that can speed things up,” he adds, referring to Australia’s capabilities.

Moreover, Australia – especially Queensland and West Australia – has extensive mining industries. “We can build things in the middle of nowhere cheaply, quickly and effectively,” he says. These industries build in modular fashions and have significant buying power, Parry says, nothing ESI has opted to use a mining EPC to help it build its batteries.
While Australia doesn’t do a lot of mineral processing, “we’ve got a lot of companies that know how to,” Parry notes.
Parry says ESI is sourcing its materials from the Gold Coast to Townsville, with electric components coming from Gympie.
Advocates have long proclaimed the time for flow batteries is neigh, but given Australia’s federal and state ministers have now agreed to what is effectively a National Renewable Energy Storage Target – dubbed the Capacity Investment Scheme – the assertion may finally come true.

Flow batteries have a number of unique qualities that are particularly promising for Australian environments, including being non-flammable and able to endure high temperatures and harsh conditions. 
In the case of ESS flow batteries, the technology boasts between six to 12 hours of storage, a modular design enabling installations from 400 KWh to more than 1 GWh, 20,000+ cycling capability with no degradation, 100% recyclability and a more than 25 year lifespan.
Unlike vanadium flow batteries, probably the best known flow chemistry, iron-flow batteries also have the bonus of an easily-accessible base. “People are very excited by the idea that a battery can be built with this earth abundant material,” Dresselhuys says.
The issue of energy density is often lobbed at flow batteries – but it is a criticism neither Dresselhuys nor Parry think is particularly relevant at the utility-scale the pair are targeting.
“Flow batteries are less energy dense and if anybody is making it sound like that’s a mystery, they are being silly,” Dresselhuys says. “Lithium is optimised for density because its primary use around mobility applications… but when you start to look at batteries at very large scale, density actually doesn’t matter much.”
“If you look at the amount of land required to deploy very large scale [flow] batteries versus the amount of land you are going to use for the solar or the wind plant, we’re a postage stamp,” Dresselhuys says.

Given flow batteries’ perks, alongside Australia’s vast landmass, the deployment of grid-scale lithium batteries is a little perplexing, but Parry thinks it comes down to a question of comfort. In his eyes, lithium got into Australia because a billionaire took a bet with the South Australian government and gave it to them practically free. “Lithium hasn’t been in the grid that long but people are comfortable with it.”
While lithium battery manufacturing is already a fairly established business, the same isn’t true for flow batteries – a crucial in for Australia. “We’ve got vanadium batteries, lithium batteries, iron flow batteries, zinc-bromine batteries, we’ve got batteries in development and the more we do that, the stronger industry we have,” Parry says.
“If we all work together, we’ll be able to meet our climate needs but we’ll also be able to export our knowledge. And this is really what we need to do – we need to make and export that knowledge because knowledge, and ownership of that knowledge, ensures royalties which ensures greater research which flows into creating that next generation.”
Given a chance, both Parry, Dresselhuys and many others believe flow batteries will be able to cater to large-scale customers.
To that end, ESI is targeting wholesale electricity generators, energy retailers and commercial and industrial customers.
Primarily, Parry says, ESI is working with large generators though. He wasn’t able to comment on any partnerships publicly, but urged us to “watch this space.”
Currently ESS has two primary products: its energy warehouse, which comes in a 40 foot shipping container, and caters to commercial and industrial customers with a nominal power output of 75 kW and peak energy of 400 kWh.
Its second offering, the Energy Center, is apparently scalable to MWh or GWh of energy storage and targets the utility-scale. 
Parry says ESI is also looking at creating derivatives of these products for the Australian market.

“How radical Chubb’s assessment of what needs to change within the carbon credit market will really impact whether we see a revolutionisation of the Australian carbon credit market or maybe just some tinkering around the edges,” Emissions Removal Manager at the Australian National University’s Below Zero, Caitlyn Baljak, tells pv magazine magazine.
“Because this market is so convoluted,” she adds, understanding exactly where the issues are and how they are connected is difficult. “It’s not easy for the everyday person to see what’s happening,” she notes.
Given the policies could not only make or break Australia’s climate achievements, but are also attracting the likes of Genex Power co-founder Simon Kidston, who on Monday launched his new carbon development business Permagen – likening the move into Australia’s burgeoning carbon market to his play with Genex back in 2013 when renewables were still in their infancy, it’s worth understanding where the issues lay and how they might be addressed.

In the simplest terms, one Australian carbon credit unit, or ACCU, is supposed to represent one tonne of carbon dioxide abated. Emitters can then buy the credits and say their emissions have been cancelled out, or brought to a net zero. 
This offset system has many critics, which we’ll get to later, but the drama that unfolded this year surrounding Australia’s carbon credits basically boiled down to the claim that one credit currently does not represent one tonne of abatement, and very few of the projects making money for creating credits actually made real, additional abatements.
Core Markets
This is a major problem for Australia’s Safeguard Mechanism, a scheme which makes it compulsory for Australia’s biggest emitters – 215 facilities producing more than 100,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases a year – to offset their emissions. These facilities offset emissions using Australian carbon credits, so if that scheme is bogus so too is the foundation on which the Safety Mechanism rests.
This is a major problem for the recently elected Albanese Labor government, which campaigned on reducing Australia’s emissions 43% by 2030. To reach that goal, Labor simply has to to make these long running schemes work properly.
The saga around the integrity of Australia’s cornerstone climate schemes begun in earnest with whistleblowing from Australian National University professor Andrew Macintosh, the former head of the committee responsible for ensuring the integrity of the Emissions Reduction Fund under which carbon credits are made, who claimed the $4.5 billion scheme effectively amounted to taxpayers’ money being spent on fake climate action.
For Macintosh, in their current form Australian carbon credits amount to “fraud.” 
“The available data suggests 70 to 80% of the ACCUs issued to these projects are devoid of integrity – they do not represent real and additional abatement,” Professor Macintosh said at the time.
This was denied by the Clean Energy Regulator, the government body that runs the scheme, but the new Albanese government nonetheless opted to launch an independent review.
Many players from within the industry, including participants in the carbon credit scheme, applauded the step – though of course the rejoicing was far from unanimous.
Looking at the review submissions, which have now been made public, organisational lines tend to follow the expected routes with big emitters who buy credits insisting they’ve done their due diligence and companies behind carbon credit projects insisting their methods are scientifically sound. 
On the other side, submissions from organisations like ANU Institute for Climate, Energy & Disaster Solutions, advocate for a complete overhaul of both the scheme’s governance and methodology, pointing out with the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism slated for implementation in 2026 and similar policies looming elsewhere, Australia can either get real or haemorrhage in future economies. 
As ANU’s Baljak names it, the “biggest fish” seen to be jeopardising Australia’s carbon credit scheme are issues of governance of the umbrella Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF) and three of the carbon abatement methodologies: 
While there are a total 38 methodologies that can be used to create carbon credits, the above three account for the vast majority of credits and have come under the most fierce scrutiny.
In short, this method involves allowing forest and native vegetation to grow on land previously been used for livestock grazing, growing non-native plants or where for whatever reason human-actives were seen to be suppressing natural regrowth.
While allowing forests to regenerate is widely accepted as a good thing, the issue with this method is the “human-induced” claim. In short, critics say forest regrowth usually has little to do with less grazing from livestock or impacts of feral animals – the two main ‘human induced’ regeneration approaches – and instead rests of natural rainfall.
A recent paper from Professor MacIntosh and others from ANU and the University of New South Wales, found basically all of the HIR projects are located in semi-arid and arid areas that have never even been comprehensively cleared. 
The premise humans are suppressing growth, and should earn money for changing their ways, is fatally flawed and needs to be fundamentally revised, critics say.
Again, the criticism here is not that avoiding deforestation is a bad thing, but rather that the government is paying people to not clear land they never actually intended to clear.
Research from the Australia Institute found credits awarded for ‘avoided deforestation’ were issued based on land clearing rates between 751% and 12,804% higher than anything seen on the ground.
“The method totally overestimates the rate at which landholders would be clearing, and so you’re basically creating fraudulent ACCUs within the system unfortunately because of that misestimation of what the reality and the counterfactual would be,” Baljak says.
Coming back to the method’s intention, it does echo back to concerns state and territory governments do, or have in the past done, a poor job of protecting native forests. While Baljak says lower governments still don’t have enough checks and balances in place to adequately protect forests, her institute still believes it is best to revoke this method entirely.
This method basically boils down to companies capturing the gas from Australia’s landfill sites, mostly methane, and combusting it to create the less potent carbon dioxide.
While the landfill gas is among the best at actually counting concrete emissions (much better than say the assumed carbon abatement from a tree that may or may not grow), the issue here comes down to questions of baselines and additionality.
As the method evolved, different projects in scheme have had different baselines. Those who entered early were given low baselines – “some as low as 0%,” Baljak says.
“Unfortunately the way it has worked out is that it tends to be those bigger players who have those lower baselines – who don’t really need that incentive – and those smaller players, where that benefit really comes into play, that have been stuck with the higher baselines, and it just makes it more difficult for them to compete with other landfill gas producers,” Baljak says.
This has made the footing for players in the game majorly unequal and has resulted in landfill gas companies welcoming the review.
The other issue here is that landfill gas companies can also participate in other schemes like claiming Large-scale Certificates, the subsidy given for supplying renewable energy to grid. They therefore already have a financial incentive to capture landfill gas and (instead of flaring) using gensets to turn that gas into energy for the grid, so some say the carbon credit incentive amounts to a form of doubling up.
Given the issues with Australia’s carbon credit scheme are pretty foundational, it begs the question of how much such reform will cost. According to Baljak, the biggest expense is always setting up the regulator. Luckily, the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) exists already, so that’s done. There are many questions about CER’s governance of the scheme going forward, but clearly the federal organisation will be involved in oversight into the future.
Baljak doesn’t think the additional cost will be that significant going forward, and that any cost would well and truly be offset by the better price a high-integrity carbon credit can collect.
“One of the biggest things that you can do for integrity of the scheme, even if it does end up costing slightly more in the scheme of things, is that demonstrated evidence through direct measurement that the carbon that you say is in the ground is in the ground,” she says.
“Ultimately if you have a higher integrity scheme and buyers are willing to pay more for those units, that will more than cover the additional cost of the measuring and monitoring through that consumer confidence which translates to a higher purchase price for the carbon.”
Energy analytics firm RepuTex has forecast Australian carbon credits could increase from $33 (USD 22.50) each now to as high as $110 by 2032. Baljak says some of this high price should 
be transferred to regulator as the body responsible for ensuring integrity, rather than only to the landholders and carbon credit aggregators. 
Described by the Saturday Paper as the “most important climate policy you’ve never heard of,” Australia’s Safeguard Mechanism is supposed to drive down the emissions of Australia’s biggest polluters, those emitting more than 100,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases per year.
Introduced by the former Coalition government, the policy basically works on the principle that each polluting facility is given a “baseline” (not to be confused with a cap) to dictate how much it is allowed to emit. If the facility goes over that baseline, it is mandated to buy carbon credits to “offset” those emissions.
Since the “offsetting” component of this scheme largely relies on Australian carbon credits, its usefulness really rests on whether the government is able to sort out the integrity issues outlined above.
Beyond that though, the Safeguard Mechanism has a plethora of its own issues. Around 215 of Australia’s biggest climate polluters are subject to the mechanism, but since the scheme was brought in in 2016, the emissions from those facilities have actually gone up 7%, or, in carbon emission terms, nine million tonnes. Emissions from some gas extraction facilities went up a massive 20% in that time, analysis from the Australian Conservation Fund (ACF) found.
The core issue here is the “baselines” given by the former government were so generous they were entirely useless. The ACF also found that many of the facilities captured by the Safeguard Mechanisms had baselines double their estimated emissions. “In one instance, a facility had a baseline set twenty times higher than its predicted annual emissions,” the ACF said.
Journalist Mike Seccombe used a brilliant analogy for the scheme, describing it like “a limbo dance where the bar was set so high that participants did not have to lower themselves to get under it.”
The current review of this scheme is examining this baseline question, as well as which new sectors and facilities should be included. 
The review is pretty far along, with a bill looking to amend the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (NGER Act) and Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011 to establish Safeguard Mechanism Credits, covering how credits are issued, purchased, and included in the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units, introduced to the lower house of Parliament on November 30.
An exposure draft of the new Safeguard Mechanism Rule is also imminent, with the government closing the stakeholder consultation period on the draft on October 28. The new rules are slated for effect July 2023, provided they pass both houses of Parliament.
In a recent look at the Safeguard Mechanism reforms, thinktank Climate Energy Finance director, Tim Buckley, noted that what is really need is legislation rather than regulation. That is, the market parameters need to be set in a meaningful way for the scheme to have any hope.
It’s also worth noting the whole Safeguard Mechanism premise has a lot of critics – the main thrust of that argument is that ‘offsetting’ instead of actual emissions reductions is a silly path that amounts to more threading water on climate than actual forward movement.
Another facet of this whole reform saga, Baljak points out, is that if Ian Chubb does come out with recommendations that meaningfully shift how Australian carbon credits are created – ensuring only high integrity, meaningful abatement projects are awarded credits – that will dramatically limit the supply of carbon credits. That, in turn, would mean there are far fewer credits on the market for facilities captured by the Safeguard Mechanism to buy.
This demand massively outstripping supply would place a huge stress on the market. “If the Chubb review comes along and says, ‘We’re going to fix these integrity problems’, credit supply is going to plummet and, as a consequence, prices go through the roof,” Baljak says.

The International Code Council, along with the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) have released an energy storage handbook – the Energy Storage Systems Guide. The document can be found in the Clean Energy Clearinghouse’s Training for Safety Officials series.
The guide is meant to serve as a high level, non-technical, training reference for fire and explosion risks, providing key standards for equipment and installations (along with the applicable hardware codes), and describing inspection techniques for energy storage systems.
Battery stress testing

Chapter 4, Fire & Explosion Risk in Lithium-Ion Battery Energy Storage Systems, describes how fire events develop, including a breakdown of the 2019 APS battery fire in Arizona. The chapter discusses fire and explosion risk mitigation techniques that are integrated at the multiple levels of battery construction. It also discusses the tools and safeguards integrated into the battery systems, such as smoke, flame, and gas detectors, fire control panels, and fire suppression systems.
The guide lists 24 unique battery standards. While all of these standards are necessary, five of the standards are described as “most relevant and applicable for the majority of modern ESS applications”, including NFPA 855, UL 9540, UL 9540A, NFPA 68/69, and IEC 62933.
The handbook also includes a table of the applicable sections of various installation code books, including the International Fire Code, the International Residential code, the International Building Code, and the National Electrical Code. Of course, not all codes are applicable to all projects.

The handbook ends with a series of checklists, and the “Basis of Requirement” that drives the actions in the checklists. For instance, the first item in the “Document Submittal Checklist” is the Commissioning Plan – whose Basis of Requirements is the IFC 1207.1.3. The other checklists are the “Utility-Scale BESS Enclosure Inspection Checklist”, the “UL 9540A 4th Edition Unit Level Report Checklist”, and the “Residential or Small Commercial Packaged BESS Inspection Checklist.”
In IREC’s 2021 Solar Jobs Census, the 255,037 jobs that were primarily focused on solar energy in solar power companies were complemented by another 21,910 jobs focused specifically on installing battery storage. The addition of battery storage jobs outside of the solar industry, for example, in the automotive industry – increases the number of battery storage jobs to nearly 70,000.
Headlines like “US grid-scale energy storage installations quadruple” are already becoming the norm. Since the IRA now provides 30% tax credit for standalone energy storage, these job numbers can be expected to continue growing.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/14/ranking-the-top-15-nations-for-solar-energy-capacity/,"MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 14, 2022",Ranking the top 15 nations for solar energy capacity,"From pv magazine USA
Solar photovoltaics is set to be the number one technology deployed across the globe for energy production, increasing the world’s installed capacity by 75% through 2027, adding 2,400 GW over the period, said the International Energy Agency (IEA).
The IEA report said that renewable energy expansion is 90% of the planned additions worldwide, and solar accounts for over 60% of all forecast renewable capacity expansion, setting records for annual additions every year through 2027. Cumulative PV capacity nearly triples in the IEA forecast, growing by almost 1,500 GW, and exceeding natural gas by 2026 and coal by 2027.
Cost declines and the desire to boost national energy security and climate resilience are driving widespread adoption. In the U.S., the cost of utility-scale PV fixed tilt was $7  per Watt (USD 4.75/W) in 2010, and it declined to $1.4  per Watt (USD 0.94/W) by 2020.
The world will need 5.2TW of solar power generation capacity by 2030, and 14 TW by mid century, to have any chance of limiting global average temperature rises this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius, said the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
Below is the list of the 15 largest producers of solar energy today, ranked in terms of operational capacity as reported in the BP Statistical Review of World Energy:
15) Ukraine – 8.06 GW
14) Brazil – 13.05 GW
13) Spain – 13.65 GW
12) United Kingdom – 13.69 GW
11) Netherlands – 14.25 GW
10) France – 14.71 GW
9) Vietnam – 16.66 GW
8) South Korea – 18.16 GW
7) Australia – 19.07 GW
6) Italy – 22.69 GW
5) India – 49.34 GW
4) Germany – 58.6 GW
3) Japan – 74.19 GW
2) United States – 93.71 GW
1) China – 306.4 GW
The world will have to install 450GW of new solar capacity each year – most of it utility scale – for the rest of this decade, with China and India to lead Asia to a roughly half share of the world’s installed PV capacity in 2030, estimated IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook report.
Elsewhere, North America will need to install 90 GW per year of solar to claim a 14% share of the world’s operating panels at the end of the decade, and Europe’s 19% slice of the pie will require 55 GW of annual solar capacity additions.
The world will have to start devoting $8.4 trillion (USD 5.7 trillion) per year to the energy transition for the rest of the decade to reach these targets, said IRENA. That can be feasible if the $103.3 trillion (USD 700 billion) per year channeled into fossil fuels is immediately diverted to the transition, the publication stated. Public investment in the transition will have to immediately double, too, said IRENA, to attract the remaining money needed from the private sector, which would bear most of the financial burden.
Francesco La Camera, director-general of IRENA said, “Progress across all energy uses has been woefully inadequate.”
IRENA said policymakers also need to usher in sufficient international grid connections and flexibility; training; utility scale batteries; electricity demand-side management; digital tools; peer-to-peer power trading; community ownership of renewables; time-of-use energy tariffs; and net billing systems.
