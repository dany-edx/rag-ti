While the federal government expects a net gain of 62,000 new regional jobs as part of Australia’s 2050 net zero target, independent analysis has raised alarms that the swap from ‘dirty’ to ‘clean’ generation will hardly be neat and equitable without serious planning.
On this front there have been new developments in the past week, and many this year.
The federal government has committed to delivering Australia’s first national energy workforce survey. The inaugural Australian Energy Employment Report (AEER), as it will be called, is intended to help both industry and government to avoid skills shortages and capture economic opportunities in the transition.
The report will adopt the US “gold standard” methodology for counting energy sector jobs, and will expand to include energy management across the whole economy.
The report was recommended in October last year by the Energy Efficiency Council and UTS Institute for Sustainable Futures, with the support of the Australian Power Institute, Clean Energy Council, and Ai Group, in its ‘RACE for 2030’.
The AEER is expected to be a biennial release.
Like the fossil fuel industries before it, the renewable energy sector remains male dominated. On Sunday, Victoria’s energy minister Lily D’Ambrosio announced her government would be subsiding apprenticeships, professional mentoring, and access to ongoing education to lift the number of women participating in the renewables industry through its $11 million ‘Growing our Clean Energy Workforce’ package.

Women make up less than 1% of electricians, solar designers and installers, and licensed electrical inspectors. To drive up this startlingly low figure, the Victorian government will subsidise 50% of the cost of new apprenticeships to help women enter the industry and provide apprentices a tool allowance along with six-monthly incentive payments. 
These apprenticeships will be managed by Ai Group Apprentice Training Centre and Apprenticeships Group Australia.
Announced in the second half of February, the New South Wales energy minister Matt Kean responded to the news of Eraring’s expedited closure with a $250 million clean energy jobs package built to open up new opportunities as old generators close.
The Renewable Manufacturing Fund, as it’s named, seeks to create 3,700 roles in clean industries and spark what Kean called a “manufacturing renaissance.”

2,700 of those jobs would be in the construction of transmission infrastructure needed to connect the state’s renewable energy zones and new renewable generation sources.
Another 500 job are expected to come from the boost in local manufacturing of renewable technologies like wind towers, electrolysers and batteries, for which the NSW government has set aside funds. The final 500 new roles will come from green hydrogen industries via programs the state government established with its net zero strategy.
BlueScope Steel, Australia’s largest steel producer which has its base in Port Kembla – traditionally a coal hub and soon to be among the state’s first hydrogen hubs – came out in support of the package, saying he expected tens of thousands more jobs would be created downstream.

“The potential opportunity for local manufacturers in relation to NSW’s Renewable Energy Zones is enormous – several hundred thousand tonnes of steel, around $1.5 billion of fabricated products, and almost 20,000 jobs,” BlueScope’s Managing Director & CEO, Mark Vassella, said.
“However, that opportunity won’t be realised unless industry and government invest together and coordinate their best efforts. Currently there is a lack of local manufacturing capability, and recent wind farm projects alone in NSW have seen over $200 million of components fully imported – a great opportunity lost.” Vassella said companies like BlueScope are willing to coordinate and co-invest to help grow local manufacturing. 
Compared to coal fired power plants, renewable energy jobs are primarily in the construction rather than ongoing generation of energy. While this has caused widespread concern, it seems almost universally understood today that domestic policies or stalling won’t be able to save coal-based roles. 
The transition is unstoppable and all our governments can do is put strategies in place to make the transition clearer.
Back in January, Centre for Policy Development reached much the same conclusion, but flagged that between 100,000 to 300,000 regional jobs would be in jeopardy. Just a handful of areas would bear most of this, with ten local government areas (LGAs) predicted to account for around a third of all affected jobs. Those areas were primarily in central Queensland’s Bowen Basin, the Upper Hunter in NSW, and the Pilbara in Western Australia.
In terms of jobs gained, Blueprint Institute in February released a report which concluded approximately 6,200 new jobs in renewable energy projects will be created in South-West Queensland. Of these, nearly 1,000 would be permanent, long-term positions.
Last year, Community group Solar Citizens released a report using modelling from the Australian Energy Market Operator to show 43,500 clean energy job years would be created in Queensland alone under its Step Change scenario, which has since become the operator’s central scenario. 
The federal government, when it released its somewhat underwhelming net zero 2050 “strategy” ahead of the COP26 climate summit, said it expected a net gain of 62,000 jobs for regional communities. 
Worldwide, renewable energy employment worldwide reached 12 million in 2021, up from 11.5 million in 2019, according to the eighth edition of Renewable Energy and Jobs: Annual Review 2021.
While it’s clear renewables will open up a whole arena of new jobs, it would be untrue to suggest it will be a ‘like for like’ swap for energy workforces. The nature of the work, alongside the fact that its workforces won’t have decades, centuries even, of union negotiations to sweeten their conditions, will mean big changes are coming – and for some, they are already here.

Risen Group’s Head of Product Development, Danny Song, said the company has “enduring evidence” of its panels’ longevity, giving it “utmost confidence” in its decision.
Song added that improvements in material and module processes, as well as the company’s 20+ years in manufacturing enabled the extension. 
The news comes just weeks after Singapore-headquartered solar manufacturer Maxeon Solar Technologies, which sells in Australia under the SunPower Maxeon brand, extended both its product and performance warranties to 40 years on its Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC) product line. These extended warranties were first introduced to Australian and European markets.
Likewise, in February South Korea’s Q Cells became the “first to market” with a 15 year product warranty on its home battery range.

According to the German announcement, consortia with “at least two German and one Australian partner” will be able to submit real-world projects for pilot, trial and demonstration. The application will happen in two stages with projects to submit an initial brief proposal before May 3, before proceeding to a full proposal later in stage two.
Project activities are expected to occur primarily in Australia.
“With HyGATE, we want to create the basis for a long-term partnership for climate-neutral energy sources with Australia,” Germany’s federal research minister Bettina Stark-Watzinger said. 
“The current situation clearly shows us that we must become independent of Russia as an energy supplier. With its great potential for renewable energy, Australia offers the best conditions for the production of green hydrogen. 
“The German-Australian supply chain for green hydrogen is an important step towards climate neutrality and more independence. Furthermore, our relations are close and based on trust… We want to take this as an opportunity to further deepen our good relations,” she added.

The funding is part of the state government’s $3 million Latrobe Valley Energy and Growth Program, from which $1 million was allocated last year.
The projects funded include a floating solar demonstration project at Lardner Park which has been allocated almost $210,000. The solar project, led by the Gippsland Climate Change Network, will use the “underutilised” lake to ensure viable land for agriculture remains free, simultaneously reducing evaporation and preventing algae growth.
Lismore City Council
Nearly $240,000 in funding will go to Earthworker Energy Manufacturing Cooperative to design, develop and manufacture portable solar-battery systems to assist emergency services during extreme weather events. Earthworker has a worker-owned factory (hence the ‘cooperative’) in Morwell, where solar hot water technology and heat pumps are already being made.
More than $390,000 will also be provided to the Yarram Recreation Reserve to install solar, a battery and a portable renewable energy system to ensure the local state emergency services, fire authority and Red Cross which use the reserve will have access to power during outages and emergencies. 
The other projects to receive funding include solar installations for the Yallambee Aged Care Energy Optimisation Demonstration, the Renewable Growth for Heyfield Project and the Gippsland Employment Skills Training Project. 
Two storage projects have also receive a cut, including Sunny Afternoons which has been allocated more than $210,000 to install battery energy storage systems at dairy farms in the Latrobe Valley. 
Finally, the Wellington Shire Council has been funded to complete the feasibility of geoexchange/geothermal technology, though no more details of the project nor the precise allocation of funding are known.
Victoria’s Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change Lily D’Ambrosio, who announced the funding on Monday, said the nine projects will mean regional Victoria remains “a leader in energy, engineering and innovation.” 
“This is about supporting local businesses to deliver renewable energy systems that not only slash emissions and electricity bills, but provide power during extreme weather events, improve community resilience,” she added. 
Member for Eastern Victoria, Harriet Shing, said the projects would also ensure the coal heartland makes the most of its skilled workforce and transmission infrastructure.
The first $1 million round of funding for the Latrobe Valley program went to the Ramahyuck District Aboriginal Corporation to construct a 4.9 MW solar farm. The Ramahyuck solar farm, announced in September last year, will be the first solar farm wholly owned and operated by an Aboriginal Corporation, and the first on Aboriginal-owned land in Victoria. 
The Ramahyuck District Aboriginal Corporation also received funding to install install solar arrays atop the Heyfield and District Museum, Coongulla Community Hall, Heyfield Golf Club and Heyfield Tennis Club.

A consortium led by Australian financial group Macquarie Asset Management has agreed to acquire French solar developer Reden Solar from French infrastructure companies Infravia and Eurazeo. Reden told pv magazine in October that its sale process “was under way,” with France’s TotalEnergies bidding on it along with Macquarie.
The Macquarie consortium, which also includes UK-based investment firm British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCI) and Germany’s MEAG Munich Ergo Assetmanagement GmbH, has invested €2.5 billion (AU$3.7 billion) in the transaction, which is scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of 2022.
Reden Solar, with offices in France and Spain, develops, finances, builds and operates solar photovoltaic power plants in Europe and Latin America with an installed portfolio of 762MW and a portfolio under development of 15GW. France and Spain are its main markets, and it has recently expanded its presence in Greece and Italy.
Macquarie Asset Management’s stake in Reden Solar will be purchased on behalf of institutional investors through the Macquarie Global Infrastructure Fund and the Macquarie Green Investment Group Renewable Energy Fund 2 (Mgref2, which raised €1.6 billion (AU$2.35 billion) at closing in February 2021). Reden Solar is the fourth investment for Mgref2, having recently completed the acquisition of Apex Energies Group, in France.
The Macquarie Group has invested or disposed of around €40 billion (AU$59 billion) in green energy deals since 2010 and has more than 50GW of green energy projects under development, construction and operation around the world.

Our Next Energy (ONE) has secured US$65 million (AU$88 million) in a funding round led by BMW i Ventures to scale up its electric vehicle business. The funds add to a US$25 million (AU$34) Series A funding round in October that was led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures.
ONE has signed contracts with four automakers and has a five-year, 25GWh energy storage pipeline. This equates to 300,000 electric vehicles, it said. It noted that the latest round of funding will help it begin the site selection process for its first US-based battery factory. It said it will also accelerate R&D in Michigan and San Francisco.
In January, ONE created a proof-of-concept device with 732 miles (1178 kilometres) of range. In another pilot, the company paired a Tesla Model S with an experimental battery with 203.7kWh and an energy density of 416Wh/L. The battery was able to power the Model S at 88km/h for 882 miles (1420 km) on a single charge, as validated by third-party testing.
“ONE’s core principles of doubling the range, decreasing the cost of the batteries and creating a local supply chain, resonated strongly with us at BMW i Ventures,” said Baris Guzel, partner at BMW i Ventures. “ONE’s battery factory in the US is an important step for the larger electric vehicle value chain, and ONE has the potential to truly transform the ecosystem.”
The company builds lithium-ferro-phosphate batteries, which don’t need earth-rare cobalt, said ONE. It currently has two proof-of-concept battery models: the Aries and the larger Gemini, which was used in the Tesla demonstration. ONE said it will begin Aries production in late 2022, and will demonstrate a production-level prototype of Gemini in 2023.
