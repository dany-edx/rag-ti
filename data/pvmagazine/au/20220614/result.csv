The commonly listed reasons for the crisis, including coal plants failures ensuing from disrepair, soaring global gas prices, and a local cold snap, strike Bruce Mountain, the Victoria Energy Policy Centre’s director, as “naive” and “uncritical” of what’s really going on. That is, it fails to grapple with the market dynamics at play and the incentives for generators to exacerbate problems and withdraw supply to manufacture higher prices.
“I think there’s very likely to be extensive market cornering here,” he told pv magazine Australia. “It’s a confluence of market design and market policy failure over a long period of time which has got us to this position.”

More on that shortly, but in the meantime the director expects AEMO to bring the situation under control in the coming weeks through mechanisms which allow it to force generators to produce energy. A full energy market intervention involving state and federal governments is also distinctly possible, albeit severe, he said. 
Although it has been building for some weeks, the crisis has ramped up dramatically in the last days as market price caps from AEMO have come into effect. This has caused generators to withdraw production.
“Arguably they [generators] have been doing that already, but not actually pursuant to price caps. They’ve been doing that to push the prices up to even higher levels,” Mountain said.
Now the price caps have arrived, gas generators are hitting back by saying they can’t cover costs, and are refusing to produce, he says. While fuel prices for gas and coal have certainly increased, Mountain points out most generators operate using longterm contracts.
“It’s not altogether clear altogether clear what the production costs are of coal and gas generation today. You can point to spot markets price as some have, and they’ve said we need $440 per megawatt hour in order to generate from gas, but a whole lot of the fuel that the generators use is actually contracted already, so these are not the costs that they face.”

Moreover, the underlying incentive for coal and gas generators to fix the problem is “weak” Mountain says, as companies know “they can get fantastically high prices when they don’t fix things in time.”
“And more generally, feeling there isn’t a lot of competition from storage to push them out of the market,” Mountain says, referring to the lack of renewable industry competition which could counteract this price gouging. 
The core issue – as AEMO have also alluded to – is not a complete and sudden disparity between supply and demand. “It’s a question of ensuring that [generators] actually produce, and there are processes for that,” Mountain says.
“It will be a severe things for the government to take charge of the market, but I think it’s probably come to that.”
AEMO has already begun practicing market interventions, Mountain says. “I suspect they’ll be doing more and more of that,” he added.
Mountain expects soon the government agency will begin instructing production, in which case generators would be forced to produce whether it’s profitable or not, and would be compensated for their generation based on their actual costs at a later date.
“It will almost certainly mean a lower cost of production than the cost we have now because all the generators are getting the market clearing price.”
If generators refuse to follow AEMO’s production orders, Mountain says it would result in not only fines for them, but a “massive power supply crisis.”
“But I think that’s almost inconceivable. The industry would be absolutely cutting their throats because they know this would just be blatant bullying.”
Another solution which could be introduced is something Victoria Energy Policy Centre has been advocating for sometime: an energy storage target.
Such a proposal isn’t new for clean energy circles. It would work similar to the Renewable Energy Target (RET), and would even follow in its acronym footsteps, labelled the REST, or the Renewable Energy Storage Target.
Such a scheme would create an obligation to buy energy storage credits and thus stimulate investment.
Irrespective of market design reforms, which also need to happen Mountain says, such a scheme should be introduced quickly to prompt storage market. 
“There is no storage policy.”

“We have no systematic compensation for storage. We have R&D type funding and the CEFC  [Clean Energy Finance Corporation] chucks a bit of money at batteries here and there, but we don’t have a storage incentive scheme.”
While it remains to be seen, it is believed the new federal government will be far more receptive to such ideas compared with the outgoing coalition.
In the medium term, the solution doesn’t come in the form of schemes but the construction of actual storage facilities, Mountain says.
This should be prioritised above transmission lines, he adds.
“Governments need to pull out all the stops to ensure storage is built now.”
“We can build a great deal of storage very quickly,” he adds.
Storage would compete with coal and gas generators in the evening, offering an alternative – competition – in a system where there is currently none.
“The critical issue is storage, storage, storage.”

The company claims the system is the “largest approved grid forming battery in the country,” though the number of projects with inverters capable of providing system strength services is rapidly gaining traction, with AGL’s 250 MW / 250 MWh grid forming battery near Adelaide already in construction.
Edify’s battery system, which totals 150 MW / 300 MWh will be made up of three separate partitions:
Designed and developed by Edify, these energy storage systems will use Tesla Megapacks paired with their own inverters.
The company said it has also already gained approval from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and network manager and operator TransGrid to operate the batteries in ‘virtual synchronous generator’ mode from the commencement of commercial operations.

Construction of the project is set to begin in the “near future,” Edify said, with Tesla Motors Australia under contract to deliver the facility.  
The project will be completed in stages from the first half of 2023.
Edify has already negotiated long term offtake agreements with both Shell Energy and EnergyAustralia for the batteries.
Shell Energy will gain access to operational rights over the 60 MW / 120 MWh RESS 1 partition of the battery, Edify said. It added this agreement has been a “key component” in Shell securing a long-term retail contract with the NSW Government as part of its Whole of Government electricity supply process.
Likewise, EnergyAustralia will gain access to operational rights over the RESS 2 and DPESS partitions for a combined 90 MW / 180 MWh.
To realise the project, Edify negotiated what it is referring to as “an industry first agreement” with Federation Asset Management. The agreement will be Federation acquire a majority shareholding of the project as the seed asset for its Sustainable Australian Real Asset fund, a “pure play” Australian energy transition fund it manages.  
Edify said it continues to maintain a long-term ownership interest in the project and will undertake the construction management and long-term asset management roles for the batteries, aligning interests with its majority equity partners.
“Edify and Federation Asset Management’s strong track record with these projects, and the long-term offtake agreements Edify negotiated, make this an attractive and credible financing opportunity and Westpac is pleased to be a part of it,” Westpac Institutional Bank’s Chief Executive, Anthony Miller, said.
Westpac, alongside the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and DNB have provisioned the long-term syndicated debt facility.

The South Korean Energy Agency has launched the first of the two PV tenders planned for this year.
In the procurement exercise, the agency intends to allocate 2,000 MW across four project categories: installations of less than 100 kW; projects ranging in size from 100 to 500 kW; PV arrays with a capacity between 500 kW and 3 MW; and solar plants with an installed power of over 3 MW.
Selected projects will be awarded a fixed rate under a 20-year contract under the country’s renewable energy certificate (REC) scheme and will sell electricity to local power distributors. Projects relying on solar PV modules with a low carbon footprint will be prioritised.
Interested developers will have time until July 1 to submit their bids. The tender’s final results are expected to be announced on Aug. 19 and the winning bidders should be awarded a final contract in October.
In the two tenders held in 2021, the KEA allocated 2 GW and 2.2 GW, respectively, while in 2020 it contracted 1.2 GW and 1.4 GW. In 2017, 2018, and 2019 total allocated capacity was 600 MW, 600 MW, and 850 MW, respectively. Overall, South Korea‘s authorities should tender 4 GW of solar this year.
The country reached an installed solar power capacity of around 22 GW as of the end of December 2021. The newly installed PV capacity for 2021 was around 4.4 GW.
South Korea currently plans to install 30.8 GW of solar by 2030.

Rinnai Corp., a Japanese manufacturer of home heating appliances, has developed a new water heater powered exclusively by hydrogen.
“We have succeeded in the development of a water heater powered by hydrogen, which is sought after as a clean fuel source with zero CO2 emissions, in a way that addresses the issues of explosion risk and combustion stability,” it said, adding that the heater can be used for residential applications.
Rinnai is currently using the hydrogen water heater in demonstration projects in Australia, prior to commercialisation.
“We will develop our products in countries where hydrogen will be quickly available,” the company said. “This latest breakthrough will be an absolute game-changer, both for our business and for the wider gas industry. It will mark the beginning of bringing proven household appliances that can run on 100% renewable gas to market.”
In the past, Rinnai has developed a gas water heater that can operate with 20% hydrogen or methane blending. It also recently tested tankless water heaters that can work with 30% hydrogen or methane blending, without the need for product upgrades or modifications.
