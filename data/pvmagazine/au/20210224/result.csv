The collective capacity of the 13 batteries is expected to be around 300 MW.
News outlet Renew Economy is reporting the batteries will mostly be situated in South Australia and Victoria with a sprinkling in New South Wales. Gransolar Group, a Spanish engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor, has reportedly already secured the land and is currently undergoing regulatory approvals.
The company is expecting the first batteries to come online by the end of the year, with the rest due for completion in the first half of 2022.
Presumably responding to news of Neoen’s plan to build a 500 MW / 1000 MWh big battery west of Sydney, and Origin’s announcement of its 700 MW battery proposal in the Hunter Region, Gransolar’s Managing Director for Australia, Carlos Lopez, described NSW as a less attractive state for big battery development because of increased competition.
Instead, Gransolar are opting to focus its battery rollout on SA – due to its impressive wind and solar penetration – and Victoria – with its grid congestion woes. While only those three Australian states have been named so far, Lopez has not ruled out developing batteries in other states.
While Gransolar has its roots in solar, with hundreds of solar farms across the world, the company is says moving into large-scale batteries is a logical next move. “There is not much difference in developing a battery project and a utility-scale solar farm. Of course it has its technology challenges because it’s a different technology. But this is part of our core business,” Lopez said.
“I believe we will be one of the leaders in the space. That’s the aim – to have a significant portfolio that we can build,” he said. “The same as we have done in the utility scale solar farm, where we are like top five PVC contractors in Australia, the idea is to have significant place in the battery storage ranking.”
Gransolar’s E22 has already set to work on its first project in Australia, a 5 MW / 7.5 MW lithium-ion battery in Longwarry, Victoria. Set to provide AusNet with much-needed network services, the companies have a five year deal in place with the battery expected to be completed in the first half of this year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/24/counterintuitive-union-sees-electricity-retailer-subsidise-fast-growing-aussie-energy-management-platform/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 24, 2021",‘Counterintuitive’ union sees electricity retailer subsidise fast-growing Aussie energy management platform,"Surprising as it may be, Blue NRG’s General Manager Duncan Jacklin says the partnership, which will essentially see Blue NRG offer its customers a rebate on carbontrack’s technology, is the “natural next step” in a rapidly shifting landscape.
“A solution like ours… potentially reduces the amount of revenue initially that the retailer receives, but in the long run, they keep that stickiness and they don’t have customers churning away to other retailers,” carbontrack’s Chief Operating Officer Brendon Spear told pv magazine Australia.
“It’s a much more symbiotic, longer term relationship,” Managing Director Spiros Livadaras added.
Melbourne’s carbontrack, which launched in Australia in 2015 and has been on a speedy global ascent, has both a hardware and software component which ultimately allows users to monitor and control their electricity consumption. What’s different about the solution is its autopilot feature, which is essentially an algorithm which automates energy use to get the most cost-effective outcome by assessing appliance use and deeming them essential and non-essential – a choice which can be overridden by customers via a dashboard.
“You’re effectively digitising the distribution panel of the customer and allowing them to decide what’s important to them,” Spear said.
The solution isn’t limited to only smart appliances either, with smart plugs literally sitting between the power point and older appliance to allow them to be controlled. “When we set off on this exercise, we wanted to create an ecosystem or environment where people can retrofit their homes or offices or business” Livadaras explained. Able to be integrated with any Modbus enabled third-party hardware, carbontrack also offers demand-side management, peak shaving, storage integration, and VPP capabilities.
With its promise of its users anywhere between 30% and 60% on power bills, the Victorian company has gone definitively global since its launch five years ago. Just a year after it started out in Australia, the company moved into New Zealand and South African markets. Not long after that, it won the UK’s Tech Rocketship Award. “We were greeted at number 10 Downing Street, had tea with [Theresa] May and the got invited to the House of Lords – so that was pretty cool,” Livadaras said of the whirlwind rise.
Already undergoing trials in the US, carbontrack will officially launch there next week – on March 1. When asked what’s next on the horizon for the Aussie company, Livadaras laughs. “World domination,” he says, without skipping a beat.
Back on home turf, the company’s partnership with Blue NRG – announced earlier this month, will see the business-focussed retailer offer its customers 23% off the price of carbontrack’s energy management system. Blue NRG said its decision to partner is “absolutely” part of what it sees as a changing role of energy retailers as the world moves to a low emissions future – one where it is actively helping its customers to manage energy use and consume more efficiently.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/24/state-owned-coal-company-seeks-large-scale-renewable-projects-to-transition-portfolio/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,FINANCE,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 24, 2021",State-owned coal company seeks large-scale renewable projects to transition portfolio,"The state-owned company, which currently owns a number of coal mines and coal fired power plants, is looking to position itself for the inevitable net-zero emissions future. The move follows the State Government’s allocation of $500 million to the Renewable Energy Fund for more publicly-owned clean energy generation.
Specifically, Stanwell is looking to hear from large-scale wind and solar projects, especially those integrated with storage, though it is also “open to hearing from innovative new energy solutions.” It is also open to projects at various stages of development and has not set a total megawatt target.
“We are looking at mature projects which have a capacity of 100 MW in aggregate for the stages and early stage projects above 50 MW,” a spokesperson for Stanwell told pv magazine Australia.
While in its statement Stanwell says it is “casting the net nationwide,” it goes on to specify it is particularly interested in projects based in Queensland.
The expression of interest process opens from today, and Stanwell says interested projects should register their interest before March 24, 2021.
“The energy market is changing rapidly, and we are evolving our business in line with our customers’ changing needs and community sentiment for greener energy and lower emissions,” Stanwell CEO Richard Van Breda said in a statement.
“Through our expression of interest process, we will build a portfolio of renewable projects that meet our retail customer requirements, support the development of Queensland’s large-scale renewable industry, and enable us to diversify our portfolio and reduce our carbon intensity.”
Community group Solar Citizens has applauded the decision. “For decades Queenslanders have voted to keep the majority of the electricity system in public hands, but so far it has mainly been the private sector that has seized the opportunities to develop and operate new solar, wind and storage plants,” Solar Citizens’ National Director Ellen Roberts said. 
“We’ve just recently seen the state’s coal and gas assets decrease their value by over a whopping $1 billion as more cheap solar and wind energy comes online. It’s likely that they’re heading for early retirement. The state-owned generators need to act fast to diversify their revenue to continue to provide returns for Queenslanders.”
Stanwell’s announcement comes just one day after the Queensland Government declared it will establish a Ministerial Energy Council to work with government to deliver for the future energy needs of the State. Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen Minister Mick de Brenni office released a statement on Tuesday saying it will bring together energy sector leaders, industry bodies, consumer groups and unions and government leaders to transition the state to cleaner energy.
“This decade will herald a significant adjustment in the way energy is produced, distributed and stored,” Minister de Brenni said. “Making it vital that we collaborate, so that Queenslanders can continue to receive stable, reliable, low cost energy generation and supply.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/24/bluescope-says-climate-action-is-not-optional-while-opting-not-to-take-climate-action/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BLAKE MATICH,"FEBRUARY 24, 2021","Bluescope says climate action is ‘not optional’, while opting not to take climate action","According to the World Steel Association, 7-9% of all direct fossil fuel emissions come from the iron and steel sector. This amounts to a carbon footprint bigger than India, and just as difficult to decarbonise. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), steel industry emissions must fall by at least half by 2050. Bluescope Steel is saying all the right things when it comes to industrial-sized challenge in recent times, with CEO Mark Vassella telling ABC’s The business that “climate action is not optional for the heavy emitter,” but is the steel giant doing enough? 
The steel giant has not been quiet in recent months about its desire to contribute to the energy transition, develop green steel, and be part of the global economic future. In November 2020, Bluescope backed the New South Wales (NSW) Government’s ambitious renewable infrastructure plan through a $20 million investment into the development of a Renewable Manufacturing Zone at its Port Kembla site in the Illawarra. The investment seeks to encourage innovation in the renewable sector and work towards the Government’s goal of constructing the state’s Renewable Energy Zones with local materials.
This week, Bluescope has delivered its financial results for first half of FY2021, including a $330.3 million net profit after tax, a 78% increase on the first half of FY2020. But, more interesting is the emitter’s decision to establish a new Executive Leadership Team position, Chief Executive Climate Change, a post now held by Gretta Stephens. 
However, on the same day as Stephens succeeded to the newly created role, Bluescope also announced that, despite its significant profits during a pandemic, profits driven largely by a housing boom enjoyed only by the already rich, it was not ready to put its money where its mouth is. This is evidenced by its preemptory suggestion that despite all the company’s talk of ‘green steel’, low carbon technology plans and decarbonisation pathways, Bluescope is still planning to pursue “the most economically attractive option for Australian steelmaking while longer-term breakthrough low-emission technologies are developed.” This is to say, until someone else cleans up the industry for them. 
These statements from the company are in relation to the future configuration of the Port Kembla Steelworks, “once the No.5 Blast Furnace comes to the end of its current operating campaign, which is now expected to occur in the late 2020s, with an indicative range of 2026 to 2030.” 
While touting its awareness of “emerging ‘green steel’ technologies”, and its new Chief Executive for Climate Change position, Bluescope conceded that the most likely option for the future of the No.5 Blast Furnace would be to simply reline it and continue polluting as per usual. This can also therefore be viewed as a concession that the new Chief Executive for Climate Change position is largely meretricious. 
Vassella says that in recent years Bluescope has “built climate change into our corporate strategy, recognising that addressing climate change is essential to our long-term success and have publicly stated our commitment to taking action on carbon emissions.” Of course, creating a meretricious executive position to launder Bluescope’s reputation as part of the problem is not much of an “action”. If Bluescope really was taking action it would be investing some of those considerable profits into accelerating the development of ‘green steel’. 
“We recognise that the future of iron and steelmaking will need to be centred around breakthrough technologies – once proven and scalable” continued Vassella in a statement about the rare female steel executive in which only he spoke. “Exciting work is being undertaken around the globe to explore breakthrough ‘green steel’ ironmaking technologies,” he said, “including using hydrogen and electrolysis. Bluescope is actively monitoring the development of these technologies, which are currently in early stages of technology readiness. Such initiatives will need to be blended with public policy, capital, technology, and superior steelmaking knowhow to make them work.” 
“Steel is a very important material for modern society. It has been made since a long time back from iron ore, using coal,” Martin Pei, chief technical officer at SSAB, a Swedish company trialling green hydrogen to reduce iron ore told the Financial Times. “If we really want to contribute to realising the climate goals set in the Paris agreement, then there’s a quite widespread consensus that only doing further efficiency improvements in the blast furnace will not be enough. Breakthrough technologies are needed urgently.” 
Ultimately, the steel industry deserves no credit for admitting that climate change is a problem until it also admits that it created the problem and it is going to invest in the creation of its solution. This is especially important seeing as the steel industry is closer to major decarbonising breakthroughs than other industries.

Module manufacturer Hyundai Energy Solutions, a unit of South Korean shipbuilding group Hyundai Heavy Industries Co Ltd, has launched its new shingled PERC monocrystalline module series in the Australian and European solar markets.
The VI Series, which will also be available in the global PV market, features three different panels with a power output of 470, 475, and 480 W and a power conversion efficiency ranging from 20.1 to 20.5%.
The smallest device of the series, called the HiE-S470VI, has an open-circuit voltage of 46.4 V and a short-circuit current of 13.04 A. The biggest panel, dubbed HiE-S480VI, features an open-circuit voltage of 46.4 V and a short-circuit current of 13.16 A. The maximum system voltage for all products is 1,500 V.
The 72-cell panels measure 2,056×1,140×35mm and weigh 25kg. The panels can be used with operating temperatures of between -40 degrees Celsius and 85 degrees Celsius. The operating temperature coefficient is -0.34% per degree Celsius. They come with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 25-year product guarantee for the European and Australian markets.
The panels are encapsulated with ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and feature an MC4-compatible connector, 3.2mm white toughened safety glass, and an anodised aluminium frame.
“Hyundai shingled module technology has superior performance of efficiency and power and has a better mechanical-withstand performance compared to regular PV modules … by using electrically conductive adhesive (ECA) instead of soldering ribbon, which enables the maximum utilisation of module space,” the manufacturer said.
The company specified that it also offers shingled modules through the 60-cell VG Series, which features products with a power output of 390 to 405 W and efficiency ranging from 19.9 to 20.7%. These products also come with a 25-year power output guarantee. “As a core business entity of the large Hyundai group, the 25-year product warranty is a clear sign of Hyundai’s quality commitment and an ambition to become a reference player in the European and Australian residential and commercial self-consumption market,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
*The article was amended to reflect that the modules may have a power output guarantee of 25 years, and not 20/25 years.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/24/bloombergnef-expects-up-to-209-gw-of-new-solar-for-this-year/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 24, 2021",BloombergNEF expects up to 209 GW of new solar for this year,"From pv magazine Global. 
BloombergNEF has forecast that 2021 may become a record year for PV with over 200 GW of newly installed PV capacity.
In the latest 1Q 2021 Global PV Market Outlook, the analyst expects new PV additions for this year will range from 160 to 209 GW. For comparison, in 2020 and 2019, newly deployed solar had reached 135 and 118 GW, respectively.
Looking forward, BloombergNEF provides a conservative scenario and an optimistic one. Under the first scenario, new grid-connected PV systems are expected to total 160 GW this year and 163 and 179 MW in 2022 and 2023, respectively.
Under the second scenario, new PV additions are predicted to reach 209 GW this year and 221 and 240 GW in the following two years, respectively.
BloombergNEF analysts believe that supply bottlenecks for glass and polysilicon will not hold the market back. “Most country solar markets will grow in 2021, particularly India, which has a large number of projects delayed from 2020, and China, which is expected to maintain growth to keep course for its 2060 net-zero target,” BloombergNEF explained.
BloombergNEF analysts believe that supply bottlenecks for glass and polysilicon will not hold the market back as new capacities for both products are gradually coming online to meet strong demand. “Along with expected new glass capacity, there should be adequate supply as new factories for glass and polysilicon come online, although polysilicon will be the bottleneck and prices will probably stabilise around $12/kg this year,” the analyst said. “There is plenty of module capacity and we expect prices to drop to about $0.19/W for standard modules, based on 166mm wafers, with larger-format modules commanding a premium in markets without punitive trade tariffs.”
A few weeks earlier, BloombergNEF chief analyst Jenny Chase had forecast that the world could add 151-194 GW of new solar generation capacity this year. The analyst also predicted a recovery of the supply of glass needed for solar panels would see average module prices fall a further $0.02/W, to $0.18/W, this year.
