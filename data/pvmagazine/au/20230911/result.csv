RayGen’s technology features a field of smart, rotational mirrors that concentrate sunlight onto a tower-mounted receiver containing an array of PV modules, tiled with AZUR cells, into electricity and by-product heat. That solar energy is combined with the energy stored across two water reservoirs to create a ‘hot and cold’ solar hydro solution. When electricity is required from storage, the temperature difference drives an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) turbine to generate electricity. 

Just over a week ago, RayGen officially opened a 4 MW solar and long-duration energy storage project in Victoria, which was describing it as the world’s “highest efficiency PV project” operating at utility scale. The project in Carwarp, Victoria, boasts a 2.8 MW / 50 MWh storage capacity. The project partners claim it is the world’s largest and lowest-cost next-generation long-duration energy storage projects. Photon Energy joined the steering commitment for the Carwarp project and provided the Australian startup with advice and support during delivery.
At the opening of the Victorian project last week, Georg Hotar, CEO of Photon Energy Group was quick to mention the emerging project in South Australia: “As the RayGen technology tackles head-on the problem of intermittency of solar energy exporting electricity day and night and charging from solar and from the grid, we believe this technology has the potential to be deployed at a greater scale and we are progressing our efforts developing a similar 200 MW solar-plus-storage plant in Yadnarie, South Australia.”
“With this [Carwarp] project now commissioned, we can focus on delivering our growing pipeline of projects, especially the Yadnarie Solar Farm with Photon Energy,” confirmed Richard Payne, CEO of RayGen.

The federal government’s community battery program was embroiled in contention earlier this year when a Freedom of Information (FOI) request revealed the locations for 58 of the 400 promised batteries were selected while Labor was in opposition and had mainly been promised in locations where the party was either looking to hold or gain seats.
At the time, Chris Bowen, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, responded to questions about Labor’s selection decisions in Parliament, saying, “opposition [parties] make election commitments… governments, when elected, then deliver on those election commitments.”
Those election promises are now being put into action. In its public statement announcing the commissioning of the community battery, the government reiterated, “In April 2022, the Labor opposition made an election commitment to establish a community battery in Cabarita, and in less than 17 months, it’s now been delivered, providing cleaner, cheaper energy in the electorate of Reid.”
While the results of Australia’s community battery trials and pilots have been somewhat underwhelming in terms of financial returns and creating greater equity around green power at the local level, Bjorn Sturmberg, research leader in the battery storage and grid integration program at the Australian National University explained to pv magazine in February that where community batteries are unique is as a solution to particular local network issues.
Reliability, daily voltage control, reverse power flows, and energy resilience in the face of natural disasters can’t be worked out on the continental electricity system, they have to be addressed locally. “That’s the kind of value that you’re unlocking,” Sturmberg said.
The Cabarita battery reportedly sorts power from 50 households with rooftop solar and shares electricity with approximately 150 households. The government says the 412 kWh battery will increase capacity for local rooftop solar as well as support energy security and grid reliability. The electricity harnessed by the controlled release from the community battery is enough to simultaneously power around 20 electric cars.

With not enough network capacity to soak up excessive green electrons, the curtailment of distributed solar and battery energy storage systems (BESS) is set to have a major impact on power system transition around the world. Australia offers a unique case study because it has highest installation rate of rooftop PV, with more than 3 million solar homes, and a growing distributed BESS fleet.
Distributed PV and battery inverters in Australia are required to exhibit voltage-responsive power-quality response modes to prevent excessive voltage rises caused by increasing day-time energy exports, but these modes can curtail power output and limit the value that can be gained from these assets. Now for the first time, UNSW researchers have studied all inverter power-quality response modes and have developed novel algorithms to assess curtailment.
They worked on a sample of 1,300 households in South Australia, which is seeing the highest uptake of rooftop solar in the world with over 40% distributed PV penetration. Their study compared the experienced curtailment between distributed-PV only sites and distributed-PV coupled with battery sites.
Their results showed that average curtailment loss was 1.5% for distributed PV sites and 0.2% for distributed PV coupled with battery sites. However, some sites were heavily affected, losing up to 25% of generation, they found.
The researchers identified the reasons for the larger curtailment loss as wiring and network connection faults and high voltage set-points at households’ respective local substations.
“Other potential reason for the heavily impacted sites is being located towards the end of the low voltage feeder, however this couldn’t be verified due to lack of spatial data,” said the researchers.
They noted that the large variation in curtailed generation across sites raises concerns for system owners and suggested further inquiry into the power-quality response mode design and regulations.
Their study also examined inverter conformance using real-world operational data for all three power quality response modes, and found a low rate of conformance according to the Australian Standards. According to the researchers, there were “various discrepancies in the execution of these modes which raises concerns considering the increasing importance of distributed-PV and battery inverter fleet in supporting network operations and security.”
“The results therefore warrant further investigation into the reasons behind these discrepancies and devising appropriate mechanisms to tighten inverter conformance checks,” the researchers said, calling on distribution system operators and inverter manufacturers to take action.
Undertaking network expenditure to regulate low-voltage grids to reduce curtailment is a possible pathway moving forward, the researchers argued. However, this may be an expensive option.
They said that other solutions could include implementing dynamic network pricing, dynamic operating envelopes, and dynamic export limits to use the hosting capacity of networks more effectively.
The researchers discussed their findings in “Real-world data analysis of distributed PV and battery energy storage system curtailment in low voltage networks,” which was recently published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/11/china-solar-module-prices-dive-to-record-low/,"FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"SEPTEMBER 11, 2023",China solar module prices dive to record low,"From pv magazine Global
China solar module prices have fallen to their lowest values ever, as buyers and sellers alike reiterate that the module market continues to see intense competition and weakening demand, according to OPIS data.
The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), the OPIS benchmark assessment for Mono PERC modules from China, and TOPCon module prices plummeted for the first time in five weeks to USD 0.151/W and USD 0.157/W ($0.24 – $0.25/W) respectively this week.

 
The more than 7% plummet in both CMM and TOPCon prices comes as many sellers fight for market share. There are “more kids on the block who want to get their products sold and can pretty much only compete on price” with major tier-1 module makers, a solar market veteran explained.
One such major manufacturer could offer prices as low as USD 0.150/W for Mono PERC modules if cash is paid in advance, a source there said, while TOPCon prices as low as USD 0.153/W – to the disbelief of some – were reported during OPIS’ weekly market survey. Even at these low price levels, developers are not buying as they expect prices to fall even further and will only enter the market then, the source added.
“We are now entering an interesting period” shaped by, among other factors, “high inventory levels abroad,” according to an experienced market observer. Module suppliers in Europe are facing a heavy inventory burden, so much so that this is a “red sea market,” a source at a leading module manufacturer said.
Weakness is evident in other export markets, too. In Southeast Asia, a module seller at Bangkok’s ASEAN Sustainable Energy Week (ASEW) told OPIS that it saw very limited sales on the event’s first day, which is usually when transactions peak. Even as module prices dive, EPCs still face a “red ocean” as module costs still constitute 50% of a solar project’s total cost, a Thai EPC also told OPIS at ASEW. Over in Latin America, the lowest price quoted for Mono PERC modules at Brazil’s Intersolar South America was USD 0.130/W, a source said.
Looking ahead, the market speaks of prices gaining in the short term on the back of increasing costs for different module components. Soda ash prices, used to make photovoltaic glass, have gained significantly, noted one source, while another said the same of Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA), used as the encapsulant for modules.
More broadly, however, overcapacity concerns continue to loom on the horizon and could pull prices back down eventually. “Remember, 1 CNY/W before year-end,” a market veteran warned.
