Funded by shareholders of UPC\AC Australia, a joint venture between UPC Renewables and AC Energy, a subsidiary of Ayala Corporation in the Philippines, the solar farm will comprise an estimated 800,000 single-axis tracking solar modules and a battery energy storage system meaning the project can dispatch energy when it is most needed during peak hours and provide important grid stability services.
When completed, the Stubbo Solar Farm will generate more than one million MWh of solar energy, enough to power more than 150,000 homes and helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 600,000 tonnes of CO2 per annum.
UPC\AC Renewables Australia head of solar development Killian Wentrup said the Stubbo Solar Farm would now push ahead with its grid connection application and the appointment of a main EPC contractor.
“We hope to begin construction by early to mid-2022, subject to finalisation of our final contracts and securing finance,” Wentrup said.
“We want to thank the local community for its ongoing feedback, which helped us make changes to the project proposal and to reduce some of the potential impacts.
“We look forward to continuing that positive relationship over many years to come.”
The project will be developed across a 1,250-hectare site about 10 kilometres north of Gulgong, approximately 115 km east of Dubbo and will connect to the National Electricity Market (NEM) via TransGrid’s 330 kV Wellington to Wollar TransGrid transmission line which transects the site.

The DPIE released its final assessment decision this month, concluding that the project would support the transition of the state’s energy sector to renewable sources and provide stability for the grid.
“It would contribute 400 MW of renewable energy to the National Electricity Market, including a battery storage facility with a capacity of 200 MW/200 MWh,” the department wrote in its Assessment Report.
“Importantly, the battery facility would enable the project to store solar energy for dispatch to the grid outside of daylight hours and/or during periods of peak demand, which has the potential to increase grid stability and energy security.
“Further, existing adjacent transmission lines offer an opportunity for direct grid connection without significant new overhead lines and easements, and any potential impacts and efficiency losses that may result.”
The site is strategically located within the NSW government’s Central West Renewable Zone, that it expects will help unlock 3 GW of renewable energy generation and $4.4 billion in private capital investment by the mid-2020s.
The project is one of several that the JV has in its Australian pipeline, including the 720 MW New England Solar Farm and co-located potential 400 MW battery being built near Uralla in central NSW, the 160 MW Axedale Solar Farm in central Victoria, and the fully approved 250 MW Baroota Pumped Hydro project in South Australia.

In an industry that has experienced its fair share of success in recent years, the rooftop solar sector has been a standout performer. Built on the back of successful incentive programs such as the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES) and various state government initiatives, Australian households and businesses have added close to 8 GW of new rooftop solar capacity in the past four years, in the process making Australia a world leader in the deployment of distributed energy resources (DER).
However, with the solar boom showing no sign of slowing, focus has begun to shift to the impact that the rapid expansion of DER is having on Australia’s electricity system. In some parts of Australia, such as South Australia and Western Australia, regulators have already begun to introduce localised solutions to stabilise the grid. But with up to 50% of Australia’s annual generation likely to be served by DER by 2040, more wide-ranging solutions will be required to ensure that the grid remains stable while customers are adequately compensated for the electricity they generate.
As a result, several reviews and rule changes are currently underway to reorganise the way DER is accessed, priced and incentivised to allow us to map out a future in which solar PV, batteries and other emerging DER technologies occupy a crucial position in Australia’s electricity future.
In March 2019, the COAG Energy Council commissioned the Energy Security Board (ESB) to redesign the National Electricity Market (NEM) for a future where renewable energy and DER plays a far more prominent role. Dubbed the Post-2025 Electricity Market Design, the ESB delivered an options paper for the final design in April 2021.
Among many proposed changes to the way the NEM operates, the options paper outlines a greater role for DER in providing system and network services as its participation in the market grows. This increased role would involve a significant change from the traditionally passive relationship between retailers and their customers to a two-way market where customers are rewarded for playing an active role in the electricity market by producing electricity and adapting their demand to prevailing grid conditions.
It also recommends the introduction of technical standards for DER to better ensure the security of the power system and mechanisms for increasing competition as retailers look to offer innovative new ways for DER to interact with the electricity market.
However, while many of the proposed reforms offer positive solutions to the challenges that DER is likely to face in the coming years, it fails to provide a vision, goal or desired end state for DER in Australia. This is an important consideration as it will help with the prioritisation of policies and initiatives and whether they will assist in achieving the sector’s ultimate aims.
Positively, though, the ESB proposed the introduction of a maturity plan, a rolling reform initiative that will be updated as issues arise and priorities shift. In a sector as dynamic and fast-moving as DER, this is an important addition that will provide the industry with the flexibility to adapt to the ever-changing requirements of customers and new technologies.
The other significant piece of reform currently underway is the Australian Energy Market Commission’s (AEMC) rule change on access, pricing and incentive arrangements for DER. Among other things, this has recommended that distribution networks be given the ability to charge DER customers to export power to the grid. It’s fair to say that this hasn’t been particularly well-received within the industry, with many dismissing the proposal as a “sun tax”.
While dismissing the AEMC rule change as a sun tax is too simplistic, the proposal does raise a number of significant concerns. Foremost among these is the uncertainty it will create for both existing solar PV owners and prospective customers.
For existing solar PV owners, the sizeable investment required to purchase a rooftop solar system is based on a set of specific assumptions calculated across a system’s lifetime. Fundamentally changing the value structure of rooftop solar from a model where customers are paid for exporting electricity through feed-in tariffs to one where they are charged for exporting power to the grid has the potential to radically alter the economic basis on which an initial purchasing decision was made.
For customers looking to purchase rooftop solar, the proposed introduction of export tariffs would make it impossible for solar designers and retailers to provide them with a reliable estimate of the likely return on their investment. This would be a significant barrier to entry for new customers that could harm the continued growth of the rooftop solar industry.
The simple solution to these problems would be for the AEMC to only apply export tariffs to new connections, removing the uncertainty for existing customers and giving prospective customers a complete picture of their likely return on investment when making a purchasing decision.
While these high-level reforms will have a major impact on the future of the Australian rooftop solar industry, we can’t forget the importance of things such as compliance in maintaining the industry’s reputation. After all, if consumers lose trust in the industry and stop investing in rooftop solar, the distributed energy future being mapped out in these high-level reforms will fail to eventuate.
This is why the Clean Energy Council continues to improve compliance on its regulatory programs. Most recently, this has involved a crackdown on installers being on-site for sign-off of solar PV installations, but also includes ongoing work to ensure that installers are complying with all their obligations under the SRES and the Clean Energy Council’s accreditation guidelines.
While the changes occurring in the rooftop solar sector at present are creating uncertainty for those working in the industry, it’s important that we solve the challenges now before they get out of hand or become entrenched.
As we’ve seen all too well in other parts of the electricity market, ignoring problems until it’s too late results in knee-jerk reactions that are often detrimental to the industry’s ongoing success. Ensuring that we get it right now will save us a lot of pain in the future and will guarantee that DER plays a prominent role in our clean energy future.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/16/machine-learning-forecast-tool-tipped-to-improve-grid-stability/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 16, 2021",Machine learning forecast tool tipped to improve grid stability,"The Australian developers of a new short-term power generation self-forecasting tool claim it improves the accuracy of five-minute ahead forecasts required for large-scale wind and solar farms in the National Electricity Market and can help deliver a more secure and reliable grid.
A collaboration between Monash University’s Grid Innovation Hub, Australian engineering company Worley and United States-based Palisade Energy, the PowerPredict self-forecasting tool utilises machine learning technology to predict power outputs at utility scale wind and solar farms.
The developers said the PowerPredict forecasting algorithms achieved a 45% improvement on standard market forecasts, helping to reduce the frequency of poor dispatch and support a higher share of renewables in the market without compromising on overall grid stability.
Worley data science customer solutions global vice president Denis Marshment said the forecasting tool could also reduce Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) payments by generators resulting from the failure to meet forecast targets.
“Natural variations in weather makes it difficult for renewable generators to accurately forecast their short-term power generation levels and this impacts grid stability,” he said.
“In 2020 alone, inaccurate power predictions cost Australian generators $210 million, so using machine learning algorithms to see five minutes into the future is incredibly valuable.
“Our forecasting solution provides immediate value to our existing renewables customers as they target lower FCAS charges.”
The development of the machine learning forecasting methodology was led by Dr Christoph Bergmeir, from Monash University’s Department of Data Science and AI.
The project, which received $499,000 in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), saw two machine learning models installed at the 130 MW Waterloo Wind Farm in South Australia and the 116 MW Ross River Solar Farm in Queensland.

Traditional forecasting techniques use combinations of naive and Numerical Weather Prediction methods for power forecasts. The PowerPredict forecasting tool is based on machine learning algorithms drawing on internal supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) feeds from the generators as inputs to the model.
“Predicting short-term renewable energy generation is not an easy task,” Bergmeir said.
“Renewable energy cannot be produced on demand, as it is bound to natural resources such as the wind and sun. Therefore, in order to achieve a stable network and enough power generation, we need a reliable short-term prediction method.
“By introducing machine learning methodologies to this short-term forecasting process we’re able to apply algorithms that are trained on historical time series data, resulting in the accurate forecasting of wind and solar energy.”
Bergmeir said the project showed that improvements can be made to forecasting accuracy for both wind and solar generators by utilising and enhancing best-practice machine learning techniques.
The dual machine learning models were able to improve upon benchmark forecasts and showed major benefits when the wind farm had constraints applied by AEMO.
The developers conceded more research is needed on the solar side but said the forecasting models can be applied to all energy farms in Australia.
Bergmeir said the technology has the potential to lower energy prices across the board, and potentially open up avenues for hydro and other forms of clean energy.
“If renewable generators can lower their causer pays factors, they can produce electricity cheaper, and eventually that saving could be passed on to the customers. It would also make renewables more competitive, which is also a desirable outcome,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/16/rooftop-solar-rollout-sparks-update-of-wa-energy-plan/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 16, 2021",Rooftop solar rollout sparks update of WA energy plan,"The Western Australian Government has announced a $14.2 million package which will help deliver an updated Whole of System Plan as the transition to renewable energy generation continues at pace with 50% of the state’s households expected to have rooftop solar by 2030.
Western Australia’s (WA) energy sector is experiencing a rapid transformation, with one in three households now having rooftop solar panels; this is expected to reach one in two by 2030.
Energy Minister Bill Johnston announced this week that government department Energy Policy WA, which is implementing the Energy Transformation Strategy and recommendations of the Energy Transformation Taskforce, will receive $14.2 million to help fund policy and market development, long-term power system modelling, and co-ordination of the energy sector.
The funding will allow Energy Policy WA to prepare a second Whole of System Plan and also deliver the Distributed Energy Resources Roadmap, which is driving the integration of rooftop solar, household and community batteries, and electric vehicles in the state’s main electricity grid.
“We all know the energy system is transforming,” Johnston said during a speech at an industry forum in Perth on Wednesday.
“The influx of solar panels is changing everything that we do in the energy system.
“We’ve got 1 MW a week of new rooftop solar going into the system. We have to make sure the system takes account of the new dynamics.
“The Energy Transformation Strategy sets out the steps we must take to continue to modernise our system and plan for the long-term needs of our state.”
The original Whole of System Plan, prepared by the Energy Transformation Taskforce and released in October 2020, provided a 20-year forecast on the future of the the state’s principal electricity system, the South West Interconnected System (SWIS), but in the intervening months the penetration of renewable generation has skyrocketed.
Analysis from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) shows that one third of all homes in the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) now have rooftop solar installed, with the 2021 Wholesale Electricity Market Electricity Statement of Opportunities (WEM ESOO) report forecasting that rooftop and large-scale commercial solar systems will hit the 40% mark of total generation capacity by 2030-31.

According to the report WA is on track for a rapid transition of its entire power system, with rooftop solar and large-scale commercial system installations forecast to grow at an average rate of 8% (219 MW each year). That would mean that rooftop and commercial solar installations would exceed 4 GW by 2030-31.
Energy Policy WA’s coordinator of energy, Kate Ryan, described the uptake of renewable energy in the state in recent years as “phenomenal”.
“We’ve seen a 50% increase in solar PV on what was already a relatively high level of penetration and a 144% increase in large-scale renewables here in the SWIS,” she told those at the industry forum.
“We’ve got to points in time where the power system in the SWIS has been supplied by almost 80% renewable energy. The change is happening at pace.”
Ryan said the Whole of System Plan indicates the current figures are just the start with all four scenarios modelled in the plan predicting upwards of 70% renewables by 2040 in the SWIS.
“That is without including any explicit carbon policy directions,” she said.
“It’s quite likely the change we will see over the coming two decades will exceed this outlook.”
The modelling also reveals a strong uptake in wind power with battery storage to also play a big part in the grid’s future, helping stabilise the system as well as unlocking new markets.
While Ryan welcomed the high penetration of low emissions energy in the state’s main power grid she said it does present challenges which must be addressed.

Peak demand remains an issue while Ryan also highlighted the challenge presented by system low demand which is occurring on mild sunny days, often in the shoulder seasons when PV output is high and customer demand is reduced.
Ryan said a 2019 AEMO report had identified the issue and indicated that without action that low demand would lead to an unstable power system by 2022-2024.
“Through the Energy Transformation Taskforce we have already taken a range of actions to mitigate and manage that potential future however we’ve had increasing uptake of solar PV in the meantime which I think has exceeded everyone’s expectations so this challenge remains,” she said.
“We need to continue to manage these challenges so we can enable the uptake of renewable energy technologies.”
Ryan said work would commence shortly on the next Whole of System Plan.
The updated version will include the government’s net zero by 2050 aspiration and will take into account changing costs of technology and updated assumptions.
Version two of the Whole of System Plan is expected to be released in late 2023.
“We have a requirement to do it once every five years but while the transition in the power sector is as rapid as it has been, we anticipate doing them more frequently than that,” Ryan said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/16/china-to-add-619-gw-of-solar-this-decade/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,ASIA,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,INDONESIA",MAX HALL,"JULY 16, 2021",China to add 619 GW of solar this decade,"From pv magazine Global
Global solar powerhouse China is set to add 619 GW of solar by 2030, according to U.S.-owned Scottish data company Wood Mackenzie, with the analyst also predicting, in a statement about Asia Pacific, Indonesia will be the fastest growing solar market in the region.
China will continue to show the way as the Asia-Pacific region sees the volume of installed solar capacity treble by 2030, to 1.5 TW, according to WoodMac consultant Xin Zhang.
India will add the second largest amount of solar this decade, followed by Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, and Australia, according to the note released by WoodMac yesterday, but it will be the Indonesian market that will be the fastest growing, from a small base of 300 MW today to an estimated 8.5 GW in nine years’ time.
That rapid growth will be helped in large part by a $600 million loan given to state-owned electric company Perusahaan Listrik Negara by the Asian Development Bank last year to expand access to electricity.
India is set to miss its ambitious target of reaching 100 GW of installed solar generation capacity by next year, said Zhang, but it will rebound from its current Covid-induced slump to add an eventual 138 GW by the end of the decade.
Japan will be the region’s third biggest market to 2030, despite high prices causing a slowdown in new installations. The nation will nevertheless add 63 GW of solar in the next nine years, keeping it ahead of the 58 GW expected in a South Korean market which WoodMac says is on the rise.
The feed-in-tariff-driven solar boom in Vietnam – which saw 5.5 GW of generation capacity installed in 2019 and a whopping 13.8 GW last year – will slow to 2026, as the subsidies are tapered down but will recover to add an expected 45 GW by 2030 as solar prices reach grid parity, the analyst forecast.
WoodMac has pointed to demand for green hydrogen as well as policies at state, rather than federal level as the reason Australia will add 23 GW of solar to the end of the decade.
The analyst’s note said large scale projects will continue to account for 53% of the new capacity expected in China for the remainder of the 2020s but, elsewhere in the region, land constraints and increasing affordability will make small scale, ‘distributed-generation’ systems more popular. Smaller household and business arrays of that type will supply more than 60% of the new capacity added outside China in the region by 2030, according to the analyst, ensuring 51% of the arrays added across the whole Asia Pacific region by that date will be small scale.
The installation of 1.5 TW of generation capacity across the region will see solar’s share of the total power generation mix rise from 4% to 10%, in nine years’ time, said WoodMac, with photovoltaics generating 20% of Australia’s electricity by that date and 15% of Vietnam’s.

Researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have made a chemical breakthrough that they believe will allow electric vehicle batteries to hold almost twice the energy of their traditionally used lithium-ion counterparts.
The solution in question is a lithium-metal chemistry with an energy density of 350 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg), which is on the higher end of the spectrum, but not entirely in a league of its own. The chemistry also has the added advantage of being much lighter than traditional lithium-ion chemistries.
These aspects of lithium-metal are not new, however. What is new is the resilience of the battery. Historically, lithium-metal batteries have been plagued by premature death, with previous record holders accomplishing just 200 cycles before seeing significant drops in capacity.
The chemistry developed by the PNNL team was able to maintain 76% of its initial capacity after 600 cycles, blowing the old record out of the water. There is still work to be done for sure, as currently used EV batteries typically last for around 1,000 cycles.
