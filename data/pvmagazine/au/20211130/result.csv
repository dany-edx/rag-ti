From this date, all new and upgraded solar PV systems with an inverter capacity of 5kW or less will need to be capable of being remotely turned down or off in emergency situations.
The mechanism would be used as a “last resort” measure when demand for electricity reaches a critically low level and could affect the stability of the South West Interconnected System, Western Australia’s main island grid. 
A similar mechanism was first introduced in South Australia in September last year. Like South Australia, Western Australia has some of the world’s highest rooftop solar penetrations, sitting at around 30%.
“The largest combined generator in our state is also actually an unmanaged generator,” South Australian Energy Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan explained to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in 2020, “and that puts us at very real risk.” Similarly, in Western Australia the energy collectively generated by residential solar panels is more than that produced by the state’s largest power station.

Network operators in South Australia pulled their newly-available lever for the first time on March 14 this year, remotely switching off more than 10,000 rooftop solar systems and almost 30 MW of large-scale solar PV when the state experienced “near-record minimum demand levels for electricity from the grid.”
Western Australian networks will soon also have access to this lever, though in its statement today the McGowan government said the measure would only be used in case of emergencies, with power stations to be turned down as a first resort, leaving rooftop residential solar as the last form of energy generation to be impacted.
The measure will not affect homes with existing solar panels, though systems upgraded after February 14, 2022 will have to abide by the new rules. Of course, the new measure will not affect residents’ power supply.
Similar changes to inverter standards may be on the cards for other regions in Australia, with the Australian Electricity Market Operator (AEMO) formally foreshadowing grid-reliability issues in its Renewable Integration Study Stage 1 report released in April, 2020.
The mechanism, according to Western Australia’s government and shared by South Australia, will allow the continued uptake of residential solar without increasing costs. “This new measure means we can continue supporting the uptake of residential solar while ensuring electricity is secure and affordable,” WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston said.
In the information the WA state government has made available online, it says its retailer, Synergy, will be supporting installers to meet these new requirements. The government encouraged installers to register with Synergy to receive updates and details for information sessions and workshops. It is not yet clear whether additional measures next to inverter standards will be introduced to realise the new control capability. 
On Thursday, guidelines will be released by the government outlining export limits for systems larger than 5 kW inverter capacity. The state government has provided additional information on the new rules here.
“The Energy Transformation Strategy is planning for a long-term future where rooftop solar, batteries and electric vehicles are at the centre of the WA power system,” Johnston added.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/30/grid-forming-big-battery-breaks-ground-in-south-australia/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INVERTERS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 30, 2021",Grid-forming big battery breaks ground in South Australia,"The $180 million Torrens Island battery, announced in August, will be delivered to energy giant AGL by Finnish technology company Wärtsilä. The big battery will initially start out with a one-hour duration (250 MWh) but will be capable of expanding to up to four-hours duration in the future (1000 MWh). 
While its size pales in comparison to recent big battery announcements, the project has drawn attention for its deployment of grid-forming technology and is expected to reveal much about the promising new technology’s capabilities.
AGL expects the battery to be fully operational by early 2023, initially operating in grid-following mode before switching over to become grid-forming once Australia has finalised the new technology’s regulatory landscape.
The Torrens Island big battery will be the first in AGL’s national roll-out of 850 MW of grid-scale batteries. Rather poetically, the renewable project will be built at the site of AGL’s Torrens Island gas plant, just north of Adelaide in South Australia, and marks the first step in transitioning the fossil fuel site into the clean Torrens Island Energy Hub.

Grid-forming vs. grid-following
The Torrens Island battery will use over 100 inverters with grid-forming capabilities supplied from German-headquartered company SMA. SMA Australia’s Director of Large-Scale & Project Solutions Josh Birmingham told pv magazine Australia in August that trialling the technology at this scale “hasn’t been done before anywhere in the world.”
Traditionally inverters operate in what’s called grid-following mode, meaning their output synchronises to the grid’s voltage waveform. ‘Grid-forming’ inverters, however, set their own frequencies, making them capable of providing the grid with ‘virtual inertia.’
Image: AEMO
Also known as virtual synchronous generation, grid-forming technology was flagged by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) just last week as a top priority because of the crucial role the technology is expected to play in the clean energy transition. System strength services and inertia has historically only ever been provided by baseload coal and gas power plants with their reliable outputs, but grid-forming technologies could answer the increasingly desperate need for a clean substitute as the penetration of variable, renewable energy increases.
The various levels of grid-forming tech
There are various levels of what grid-forming technology is capable of, Birmingham said. On the most basic level, if the main grid were to go down, a grid-forming system could continue supplying power to its local network. Unlike grid-following systems, it is able to form an islanded grid because it can generate its own frequency reference.
On a higher level, it can function as a “virtual synchronous machine,” meaning it can mimic the inertia services traditionally provided by spinning mass synchronous condensers, “pushing back” in the event of voltage fluctuations in the grid.
The ultimate level though is what’s known as ‘black start’ services. That means in the case of a system black event, the plant would be able to not only restart itself but potentially reenergise an area of the grid by rebooting other assets. This is seen as the pinnacle of what could potentially be offered by grid forming technology and would mark a significant technological advancement.
Getting to the bottom of what, in reality, is plausible will be something projects like the Torrens Island will demonstrate.
Wärtsilä Corporation
AGL recently announced that its 50 MW battery in Broken Hill had achieved development consent and plans to construct a 200 MW battery at its Loy Yang A power station, a 150 MW battery at its Liddell power station as well as support grid-scale battery projects including Wandoan, Maoneng and Dalrymple.
Following AGL’s proposed demerger in 2022, the Torrens Island battery will be an asset of AGL Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/30/geelongport-invests-100m-to-establish-hydrogen-hub-partnering-with-cac-h2/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 30, 2021","GeelongPort invests $100m to establish hydrogen hub, partnering with CAC-H2","GeelongPort, Australia’s sixth largest port, today announced it will expand its current operations with a $100 million investment to build the Geelong Hydrogen Hub. The port operation, which is owned by superfund SAS Trustee Corporation (also known as State Super) and Brookfield’s LINX Cargo Care Group, will develop the facility with Singapore-based biomass gasification outfit CAC-H2.
The hub will act as both a production and distribution facility, according to GeelongPort, though the facility’s capacity ambition has not been specified. Pending regulatory approvals, the first stage of the Geelong Hydrogen Hub is expected to be operational in December 2023, the company said.
The facility is describing itself a green hydrogen plant, though hydrogen produced from biomass gasification is yet to be assigned a “colour classification” by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Advocates argue it can be classified as green (renewable) hydrogen because technically energy produced with biomass is classed as renewable, though the inclusion of biomass there has been a heated point of debate. 
Proponents of the biomass-to-hydrogen route argue it is superior because it can use, for instance, agricultural waste to produce hydrogen fuel. Critics are less convinced the budding biomass-to-hydrogen industry will actually confine itself to waste streams, and worry it could end up harvesting wood from forests as is suspected to be the case in the woodchip industries which have become colossal businesses in the United States and Europe in the last two decades.
Unlike woodchip industries however, gasification does not involve burning biomass like wood or agricultural waste to create energy. Rather, it gasifies biomass by placing it in a chamber and depriving it of oxygen while adding heat. The gas produced contains hydrogen, which is then separated out and sold.
CAC-H2 claims it process is carbon negative because it at the end it is left with biochar, an increasingly popular agricultural product which sequesters carbon in a stable form in the soil. CAC-H2 does however acknowledge that its process, unlike hydrogen made from from renewably-powered electrolysis, produces two greenhouses: carbon dioxide and nitrogen. 
CAC-H2 Director Arman Massoumi told pv magazine Australia in October that its gasification units generally output about 20% hydrogen, 50% nitrogen and 20% carbon dioxide. Massoumi said the company will likely release the nitrogen into the atmosphere because it has a low market value, while the CO2 will be emitted “into a greenhouse farm” or otherwise used or sequestered.
In terms of what this means for the process’ green status, pv magazine Australia has been told CAC-H2 has already met with CSIRO to discuss a carbon lifecycle assessment of its processes. It is seeking to demonstrate its emissions will be negative “or net zero at worst.”
The company also said it has been in discussions with the Smart Energy Council to be included in the Council’s Zero Carbon Certification Scheme. CAC-H2 will also reportedly be contacting the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) this week to discuss options for inclusion in the hydrogen certification scheme it has on the horizon.
It is worth noting CAC-H2 also claims its process can produce hydrogen for significantly less than that made via an electrolyser. The company is confident it can reach Australia’s stretch goal of producing a kilogram of hydrogen for under $2 (H2 for $2) before 2030.
This promise of carbon negative hydrogen for cheap has proven extremely popular with major companies throughout Australia. CAC-H2 was only established in mid-2021 and has already announced joint venture partnerships on at least three massive hydrogen projects, including with sawmill operation Sweetmans,  Clean Holdings proprietary limited, and with Patriot Hydrogen.
Unsurprisingly, the Geelong Hydrogen Hub is targeting the export market, saying it plans to convert the hydrogen to ammonia for export into Asia.
GeelongPort has also partnered with Startupbootcamp’s Greater Geelong Hydrogen Technology cluster and is engaging with interested parties to identify future partnership opportunities in developing the Geelong Hydrogen Hub at GeelongPort. 
In terms of Geelong more generally, which sits about an hours drive southwest from Melbourne city, Viva Energy Australia announced earlier this year that it is moving to transform its Geelong oil refinery, which currently struggling to transition to an LNG terminal, into an energy hub featuring solar and hydrogen.
Greater Geelong is part of National Energy Resources Australia’s (NERA) Australia-wide hydrogen technology clusters.

That prices for lithium-ion batteries have fallen rapidly is undeniable. At current prices, the technology is becoming viable in supporting regional electricity grids, increasing the value of renewable energy projects and powering electric vehicles. Aside from consumer electronics, where it has been established for several decades, many projects implementing lithium-ion batteries still rely on subsidies and other policy incentives, and will need to get even cheaper for this to change.
Earlier this year, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) calculated that lithium-ion battery costs have fallen by 97% since 1991. Now, some of the same researchers who produced that calculation have looked even more closely at these cost reductions to determine the key drivers behind them, and ideally to help ensure that the industry continues down the optimal path to low cost, highly efficient energy storage.
Their findings are available in the paper Determinants of lithium-ion battery technology cost decline, published in Energy & Environmental Science. The group examined data from a wide variety of sources, reaching the conclusion that improvements to the technology through research and development have been responsible for at least 50% of the price reductions achieved so far.
“The data collection effort was extensive,” Ziegler says. “We looked at academic articles, industry and government reports, press releases, and specification sheets. We even looked at some legal filings that came out. We had to piece together data from many different sources to get a sense of what was happening,” explained MIT scientist Micah Ziegler. He estimates that the research took in about 15,000 data points, gathered from 1,000 individual records from approximately 280 references.
The group’s analysis finds that research efforts to increase cell charge densities made a 38% contribution to the overall cost reductions, while work to reduce cost of cathode materials made up 18%. Reductions in non-materials costs made for 14%, and another 9.5% from improvements in charge utilisation.
Overall, the group estimates that 54% of cost reductions in lithium-ion can be attributed to research and development efforts, and economies of scale in production making up another 30%. They note that ‘learning by doing’ improvements in manufacturing and battery system design could account for only 2%, which the group says is notable since many of the most significant research achievements came long after initial commercialisation of the technology. “There were so many variables that people were working on through very different kinds of efforts,” said MIT professor Jessika Trancik, “The cost improvement emerged from a diverse set of efforts and many people, and not from the work of only a few individuals.”
The group says that disentangling the sources of cost-reduction in this way can help to inform future policy and industrial development, noting in particular that as manufacturing reaches massive scales, funding and incentives may be needed to counter market forces favouring incumbent technologies and leading to a ‘lock in’ effect.
“This is really getting at the fundamental mechanisms of technological change. And we can also develop these models looking forward in time, which allows us to uncover the levers that people could use to improve the technology in the future,” added Trancik. “The new approach allows us to potentially be a bit more intentional about where we make those investments of time and money.”

A research group from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has developed a dynamically tuneable phase-change material (PCM) that can be used to store both thermal energy and electricity if applied in buildings.
PCMs are substances that absorb and release heat energy when they change phase and are able to store and release large amounts of latent heat over a defined temperature range. In the construction business, combining building materials with PCMs is an efficient way to improve the thermal energy storage capacity of construction elements.
“However, one problem with phase-change materials is that they typically work only in one temperature range,” the scientists stated. “That means two different materials would be needed for summer and winter, which increases … cost.” In order to address this issue, the NREL team changed the transition temperature (Tm) of a PCM using ions with very modest voltage requirements. The transition temperature is the minimum temperature at which a material changes its crystal structure to another.
A dual-ion battery (DIB) was utilised to electrochemically modify the concentration of salt in the PCM and, as a consequence, change its Tm in a reversible and dynamic manner.” In a DIB, a PCM with a high initial salt concentration and low Tm serves as the electrolyte for the device,” the scientists explained. “Electrochemical charging stores the cations and anions in the negative and positive electrodes, respectively.”
The PCM, salt, and electrodes were optimised to make the DIB work as a dynamically tuneable device. “It functions like a thermal and electric battery,” the research corresponding author, Gao Liu, said. “What’s more, this capability increases the thermal storage potential because of the ability to tune the melting point of the material depending on different ambient temperatures.”
The proposed technology is claimed to reduce the cost of storage, as the same material can be used for the whole year instead of just half of it. “If we use thermal energy storage, in which the raw materials are more abundant to meet the demand for thermal loads, this will relax some of the demand for electrochemical storage and free up batteries to be used where thermal energy storage cannot be used,” said research co-author, Sumanjeet Kaur.
All the details on the storage technology can be found in the study Dynamic tuneability of phase-change material transition temperatures using ions for thermal energy storage, which was recently published in Cell Reports Physical Science. “In large scale building construction, this combined thermal and electrical energy storage capability would allow the material to store excess electricity produced by on-site solar or wind operations, to meet both thermal (heating and cooling) and electrical needs,” the academics concluded.
