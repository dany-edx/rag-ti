The debt package, described by Neoen as “one of the largest for a renewable energy portfolio in Australia,” spans seven solar, wind and battery storage assets across five states with a combined generation capacity of 1.5 GW.
This includes the Numurkah Solar Farm in Victoria, the Western Downs Green Power Hub in Queensland and the Coleambally Solar Farm in New South Wales, as well as four wind farms – Bulgana in Victoria and the three stages of the Hornsdale wind complex in South Australia.
The finance deal, which includes $55 million from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), will also help finance the development of the Collie Battery Stage 1 that is due to be completed later this year.
The four-hour battery, currently being constructed near the town of the same name about 200 kilometres south of Perth, is Neoen’s longest-duration battery project so far and its first major project in the state.
The project is also the first WA big battery to be financed by the CEFC, with Chief Investment Officer Monique Miller saying long-duration storage has an important role to play in decarbonising the WA energy network and transitioning to a grid powered by renewable energy.
“Running from Kalbarri in the north to Albany in the south and Kalgoorlie in the east, the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) network is vital to a stable energy supply across this vast state so it is fitting that the CEFC’s first long-duration battery in WA is supporting the SWIS in delivering clean energy to West Australian homes and businesses,” she said.
Stage one of the project, which has been contracted by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to help strengthen the South West Interconnected transmission system, involves less than a quarter of the project’s eventual capacity with approvals in place for the battery to scale to 1 GW /4 GWh.
When complete, the Collie Battery will provide bulk energy transfer services for power in WA, soaking up solar during the day when energy demand is low and dispatching it into the SWIS to support the network during peak evening demand.
The CEFC is one of 11 Australian and international lenders that took part in the debt financing package. Other lenders include Bank of China, China Construction Bank Corporation, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC), ING, Mizuho, MUFG Bank, and Societe Generale.
Neoen Australia Chief Executive Louis de Sambucy said The financing package provides the company with further flexibility to grow its portfolio into the future.
“This transaction demonstrates the unique combined value of our portfolio and strengthens our business model of long-term owner and operator,” he said. “It provides a solid foundation for future growth and for achieving our ambition of 10 GW in Australia by 2030.”

The Forest Glen project, being developed at Minore, about 16 kilometres west of Dubbo, includes a 90 MW solar farm and a 25 MW battery energy storage system. The NSW state significant project, that is expected to generate 221 GWh of green energy annually when complete, will connect to the national grid via Essential Energy’s existing 132 kV transmission line that traverses the site.
The project state government approval in February 2023.
At that time, the NSW Department of Planning and Environment said it had received just two submissions from neighbours of the proposed site, both objecting to the project. The submissions cited visual impact, land devaluation, and an increased threat of local flooding among their concerns.
The state however approved the project, saying it would provide a range of benefits for the region and the state as a whole, including creating up to 200 construction jobs and assisting in transitioning the electricity sector from coal and gas-fired power stations to renewable energy.
X-Elio has also agreed to make a $200,000 community contribution to the Dubbo council each year for five years, commencing when Forest Glen begins operation.
The funds are to be used for social housing development schemes with council saying public submissions on how to allocate the monies were collected during a community consultation period that closed Monday.
Council said it will discuss those submissions at a future council meeting and if suitable expressions of interest for social housing schemes have not been received, funds will be allocated to eligible community benefit projects across the local government area.
Forest Glen is part of X-Elio’s growing Australian portfolio which also includes the 200 MW Blue Grass Solar Farm near Chinchilla in Queensland.
The company, which is owned by global investment firms Canadian-headquartered Brookfield, is also developing the 420 MW Sixteen Mile Solar Farm in Queensland and the 131 MW Maxwell Downs Solar Farm and battery energy storage system in NSW.

The project, being developed in Italy’s Abruzzo region, includes a 30 MW electrolyser powered by a 45 MWp solar plant, making it one of the largest hydrogen plants in Italy.
It is forecast the grid-connected project, which will utilise existing industrial facilities in the town of Corfinio, will supply about 4,200 tonnes per year of renewable hydrogen to customers in the industrial and transportation sectors. Valle Peligna is expected to come online in the second half of 2025.
Perth-based IGE, whose Australian projects include the Arrowsmith green hydrogen plant that could eventually produce up to 100,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year, said the JDA describes the strategic partnership between it and Axpo, including the key terms, and milestones to successfully reach a final investment decision.
IGE Chief Executive Officer Stephen Gauld said the company’s partnership with Axpo will “continue to build the confidence of shareholders, strategic partners, and buyers across Australia and Europe.”
“The partnership highlights IGE’s commitment to not only fighting climate change but to also delivering a sustainable future and creating jobs in communities that will benefit from green energy,” he said.
Gauld said the Valle Peligna project, launched more than 18 months ago, is consistent with the Italian government’s ‘Hydrogen Valley’ strategy, which aims to enhance brownfield sites.
In 2023, the European Parliament mandated the building of a hydrogen refuelling station every 200 kilometres – in all major cities – along core trans-European transport network (T-ETN) routes by 2030.
IGE said it is already in discussion with hydrogen truck manufacturers regarding the fuel’s transportation applications.
The Valle Peligna project will see an initial offtake by Etex, one of Europe’s leading suppliers of gypsum products.

The project, being developed on a 33,000-hectare site in the state’s South West Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), includes an 800 MW/800 MWh battery, a 1,500 MW wind farm and grid connection infrastructure. The project is expected to generate enough clean energy to supply approximately 700,000 homes.
Virya, which owns and operates more than 1 GW of green energy generation capacity globally, said the approval of the Yanco Delta project is the first for the developer in Australia.
“This is a very exciting time,” the company said, noting that the local team is “a small team of experienced and dedicated renewable energy professionals with big plans to support Australia’s transition to clean energy.”
Federal Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said the approval of the Yanco Delta project is a significant step in the government’s plan to make Australia a “renewable energy superpower.”
“Years of political fights over climate change have cost Australia big time. It meant emissions were higher for longer. It put renewable energy projects years behind,” she said.
“We want to unlock Australia’s potential to be a world leader in renewable energy. It’s a huge task – we’re remaking our entire energy system.”
Plibersek said the project has been approved under Australia’s environment law and is able to proceed with strict conditions to protect nationally protected threatened species including the superb parrot and the plains-wanderer.
The federal government’s approval of the Yanco Delta project comes after the NSW government provided its approval in December 2023.
At that time, NSW Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said the project would make a significant contribution to the state’s net zero targets and the Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap.
“Over the next decade, three of the four remaining coal-fired generators in NSW are scheduled to retire, removing around 7,400 MW of dispatchable electricity generation from the system,” she said.
“Renewable energy developments like this one in the South West Renewable Energy Zone are critical to our energy future, so we can ensure there is enough renewable energy to replace aging coal-fired power stations.”
Construction of the Yanco Delta project is scheduled to commence in line with the completion of Project EnergyConnect in 2025-26 and is expected to take up to 36 months. Viraya expects the facility to commence commercial operations before the end of 2029.

Origin, Fortescue and Amp Energy have signed on as project partners along with green hydrogen specialist The Hydrogen Utility (H2U) and oil and gas giant Santos.
The planned Port Bonython hub – which is separate from the state government’s hydrogen jobs plan, and a $593 million (USD 388 million) hydrogen production facility and power station planned for the region – will serve as a common-user facility for the production and export of clean hydrogen.
The site is central to multiple renewable energy zones and has more than 2,000 hectares of available land as well as access to an existing deepwater port with a 2.4-kilometre-long jetty.
State government estimates suggest the hub, an integral part of South Australia’s first-mover strategy to enter the global hydrogen market, could host projects worth about $13 billion and could generate up to 1.8 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030.
South Australian Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis said the project partners have identified the state’s potential as a world-class hydrogen supplier and share its vision for the hub, which is forecast to deliver up to 6.5 GW of renewable energy development to feed up to 2.5 GW of electrolyser capacity.
“The Port Bonython Hydrogen Hub will enable South Australia to export green products made using renewable energy offshore while creating hundreds of jobs in our regions,” he said.
Koutsantonis said the state will continue to collaborate with the project partners to define requirements for common-use facilities, noting that infrastructure development at the hub is already progressing through master planning. The new improved common-user facilities will include export infrastructure, electricity transmission and water supply.
The companies are yet to release final details of their proposed hydrogen projects but are continuing to progress feasibility studies and early design works, with the development agreements providing a clear pathway for them to secure a long-term lease on land at Port Bonython.
Amp Energy President and co-founder Paul Ezekiel said the Port Bonython Hydrogen Hub is an integral part of the company’s South Australian hydrogen portfolio that includes the Cape Hardy green hydrogen project that will initially comprise 1 GW of electrolyser capacity.
“Amp’s development of transmission-connected green hydrogen and ammonia production facilities at these two strategic sites in South Australia is critical to our continued global growth and long-term strategy,” he said.
Australian company H2U’s plans for the hub centre around its proposed Eyre Peninsula Gateway Hydrogen Project which will entail the installation of a 75 MW electrolyser while Fortescue said it is in the early scoping phase of its proposed Integrated Port Bonython Hydrogen project.

It will initially install 30 MW at its Chenderoh hydro reservoir and follow up with work at its Temenggor and Kenyir hydro reservoirs.
The company said it has signed partnerships with state agencies “to ensure that the HHFS development is carried out successfully and responsibly.” It added that the rollout will support Malaysia’s National Energy Transition Roadmap, which was released last year.
According to Tenaga Nasional Chief Executive Officer Dato’ Seri Ir Baharin Din, using bodies of water for solar installation can conserve land usage, preserve land natural habitats, and reduce water evaporation.
“Unlike traditional thermal power plants, floating solar farms do not have water or air discharges that could negatively impact water or air quality,” he said. “Hence, it minimises pollution and supports biodiversity with minimal disruption to the aquatic ecosystems.”
“Floating solar farms can complement other renewable energy sources to power the national grid with the potential to boost clean power significantly.”
The HHFS project follows a Tenaga Nasional floating solar pilot project, located on an ash pond adjacent to the coal-fired Sultan Azlan Shah power plant on Malaysia’s west coast. According to Baharin, the project has been a “remarkable success.”
Data from Tenaga Nasional shows that the pilot project has generated more than 600 MWh of energy since 2019. It features 288 installed PV modules with a total capacity of 105.12 kWp, equating to enough energy to meet the needs of 30 houses.
“Every component of the floating solar system was carefully chosen and designed. Even the floaters or pontoons were made of certified food-grade high-density polyethene to minimise the impact on water quality,” Baharin said. “The project has shown no adverse impact on wildlife living in the surrounding area.”
In November, Tenaga Nasional opened a tender for a 30 MW floating solar plant in eastern Malaysia.
Malaysia had recorded an estimated 1.9 GW of installed solar capacity by the end of 2022, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. The country has committed to increasing its renewable energy composition to 70% of its total generation capacity by 2050.
