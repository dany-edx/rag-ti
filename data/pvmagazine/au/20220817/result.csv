The number of off grid properties for sale in 2020 was just 809. By 2022, there was 1362 – close to a 70% increase. For comparison, the number of solar houses on the market increased just 26% in that same period.
Victorian-based company Commodore Independent Energy Systems, which has long specialised in solar water pumps, is increasingly gearing its business towards off grid systems – specifically focusing on making units which are compact, easy to install and highly portable.
“We’re noticing the demand is there,” Commodore’s marketing manager Matt Miller tells pv magazine Australia. Moreover, he says it’s now common for the system’s payback to be competed within its warranty period.
More than the payback periods though, he believes the biggest barrier for most potential customers is the complexity of off grid systems. “People just have no idea how off grid systems work.”

To tackle this, the company has begun pre-wiring and pre-programming its systems – something a handful of other companies are now also offering in Australia.
“We’re finding electricians are absolutely loving it,” Miller says, noting it substantially cuts down the time on site and the potential for errors. “No one has to look through 200 pages of literature.”
Commodore now has 10 electricians devoted solely to pre-wiring and pre-programming units inside the warehouse. Once the system is on site, Miller says the cabinet only takes a few hours to install – though the total duration depends on how much solar is being installed alongside the system. “This completely changes the game,” Miller says.
Just last week, Chinese company EcoFlow, began marketing its new EcoFlow Power Kits for tiny homes and camper vans in Australia. Though with a smaller capacity than Commodore’s offerings, the system is also focussing on ease and simplicity, putting components like the battery system, charging system, DC converter and inverter together in a preconfigured box.

Coming back to Commodore, another key issue Miller says the company has encountered is customers’ trepidations about off grid system’s capacity and flexibility. He believes the last decade has seen some key technological advancements that, as he puts it, “makes living off grid not a burden, but basically like living on grid.”
The main off grid inverters today, Miller says, are fitted with transformers which allow them to surge – usually to about double their rated capacity. The systems are also increasingly able to integrate with generation timers, which can be set so the system only comes on at certain times and has “quiet hours.”
“It’s pretty well limitless what you can do.”
The cost of an off grid system largely depends on how big of a system is needed, but Miller says the pricing for a mid to top end system is roughly:
“They’re not crazy prices,” he says, noting the batteries in these systems generally have a 10 year warranty while the inverter warranties are between five to ten years.

In terms of calculating how much capacity a property actually needs, Miller says Commodore has put its capacity calculator tool online for customers for the sake of transparency and to allow customers to play around. “It can all be calculated without rocket science.”
With electricity demand growing but network capacities remaining largely stagnant, Miller says the company has been seeing cases where local grid connections are costing between $20,000 to $100,000.
This is a big issue in Western Australia, where solar and battery installers working in the South West Interconnected System – the state’s islanded grid – have echoed these sentiments. There, the network provider Western Power has recently begun enforcing properties stick to their grid supply allocation, which in rural and regional areas is just 32 amp for single phase or 16 amp per phase for three phase connections.
Electricians have described this allocation as “laughable” and note to upgrade, it costs $1800 just to apply, $5,000 for the second phase application and then come the equipment costs to enable the upgrade. One installer in the district previously told pv magazine Australia he had a customer on the hook for as much as $250,000.
It’s easy to imagine then that going off grid would be an attractive alternative.
Alongside interest in off grid, Miller says there’s a growing number of people wanting to stay on grid but fit batteries which will continue to work during power outages.
While high voltage AC systems generally have a better return on investment, so have proven more popular to date, Miller says customers are increasingly moving towards low voltage DC batteries, which offer more energy security. “That’s become really popular,” Miller says.
Linked to a property’s solar system, low voltage DC connected batteries are able to charge and discharge when the grid goes out – whereas high voltage batteries will often only discharge once.
The building sector and mining sectors are also turning to off grid systems to power their site offices. “We’re seeing a lot of demand from the corporate space,” Miller says, noting the interest is often driven by improving the company’s corporate image and upping its ESG cred.

In answer to that demand, Commodore released their Portable Power Station – which is Australian-made though includes some Indian and European components.
The unit’s main feature is its hydraulic frame which allows the solar panels to fold in and out, ready for transport. The 20 foot container has 15 x 390W panels – equating it a 5.85 kW capacity. 
While there’s more interest in off grid, Miller still thinks there’s a long way to go. “At this stage really only early adopters,” he says.

On August 1, Genex turned down the consortium’s initial bid to buy out the company at 23 cents per share, representing a total valuation of more than $300 million. Now the consortium have come back offering 25c a share through a scheme of arrangement (a valuation sitting close to $350 million) and Genex has given the green light to progress to the due diligence stages.
“The Board considers that it is in the interests of Genex Shareholders as a whole to engage further with the Consortium,” Genex’s board said this morning. “Accordingly, the Board has decided to provide the Consortium with the opportunity to conduct confirmatory due diligence in order to assist the Consortium to provide a binding proposal to the Board.”
The Genex board said given no better offers emerge, its current intention is to unanimously recommend that Genex shareholders vote in favour of the new bid.

Skip Capital, through its Skip Essential Infrastructure Fund, has already built up a 19.99% stake in Genex after a series of transactions in late July. Skip is an investment firm founded by Scott Farquhar, who cofounded Atlassian with Mike Cannon-Brooks, and his wife, former Hastings Funds Management executive Kim Jackson.
On top of the takeover, in the last fortnight Genex announced it had achieved record revenue last financial year, totalling more than $26 million.
Last week the company also announced its acquisition of Queensland’s Bulli Creek storage project, which comes 2 GW of development rights. The company purchased the project from Solar Choice and says it plans to develop the site in five stages – the first of which will include a 400 MW / 1,600 MWh big battery.
The developer has honed in on storage projects, noting Australia’s recent energy crisis has highlighted the urgent need for such assets.

Genex’s portfolio already includes the Kidston Pumped Hydro Storage Project being developed in the mid-north of Queensland as well as the 50 MW / 100 MWh Bouldercombe Battery, it the state’s mid coast. The company also owns the 50 MW Kidston Solar Farm – consistently one of Australia’s best performing solar farms, as well as the 50 MW Jemalong Solar Farm in New South Wales.
Australia has seen massive private takeovers and takeover bids these last year – including by Farquhar’s associate Mike Cannon-Brooks who earlier this year moved to takeover Australia’s largest “gentailer” AGL. Those bids proved unsuccessful, though his 11% stake in the company via Grok Ventures was enough for Cannon-Brooks to prevent AGL’s controversial demerger plan via a shareholder campaign.
In terms of actual takeovers, in the second half of last year Canadian asset management group Brookfield took over Victoria’s electricity transmission network, AusNet. Likewise, Spark Infrastructure – which owned major stakes in Powercor, CitiPower, SA Power Networks, Transgrid – was bought by a North American consortium led by private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
In terms of renewable developers, Tilt Renewables was taken over in 2021, while the year before saw Infigen Energy acquired by Spain’s Iberdrola.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/17/likely-to-further-dilute-trust-misunderstanding-community-opposition-to-transmission-lines/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,POLICY,QUALITY,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"AUGUST 17, 2022",‘Likely to further dilute trust’: misunderstanding community opposition to transmission lines,"Australia will need to “efficiently” install more than 10,000 km of new transmission to meet its 2050 net zero goal, according to the Australian Energy Market Operator. Building out transmission is also the cornerstone of the new Albanese government’s climate policy, Rewiring the Nation. 
So it’s worrying then that at exactly this pivotal time, the community movements against major transmission projects are growing in strength and depth. 
In its recently published report ‘Acquiring Social Licence for Electricity Transmission – A Best Practice Approach to Electricity Transmission Infrastructure Development,’ Victorian advocacy group Energy Grid Alliance argues the energy industry must take care to actually understand why communities oppose these projects, rather than simply dismissing it as “NIMBYism” (Not In My Backyard). 
It proposes reforming transmission planning frameworks alongside industry exploring different benefit models for not only directly impacted landowners but neighbours and the regions more broadly, including community ownership approaches and considering undergrounding high voltage DC lines.
“Now they’re in a situation where if it [transmission planning frameworks] doesn’t reset, the industry’s going to be tripping over regulatory hurdles and community opposition for the next years,” Energy Grid Alliance director, Darren Edwards, told pv magazine Australia.
“The ability to meet climate change obligations and future energy needs hinges on communities trusting that the planning process is fair, just and transparent,” the Energy Grid Alliance says.
Regional communities know the process is flawed and the framework isn’t right, “so there’s no way they’re going to back down,” Edwards adds.
“The current regulatory environment, not community opposition, is delaying the investment in transmission.”
Opposition, Energy Grid Alliance says, stems from planning practices which focus on finding the lowest cost corridors for transmission lines, failing to take into account environmental and socioeconomic impacts from the outset.
Moreover, the planning is done largely within major cities and “imposed” on the regions, which host the vast majority of the nation’s energy assets and renewable projects. Metropolitan planners fail to comprehend the relationship regional communities have with both the land and one another, and therefore fail to understand why the opposition is occurring.
Having consulted with regional community groups, Energy Grid Alliance’s report forefronts that regional Australian, be they intergenerational farming families or newer ‘tree change’ folk, see themselves as ‘stewards’ of the land.  “They have a real emotional connection to the land,” Edwards says, “it becomes part of them.”
“This deep attachment to place provides credibility to those who oppose a development that might negatively impact their land; it is not ‘just’ a reactionary ‘Not in My Backyard’ (NIMBY) phenomenon… but opposition based on a sense of responsibility to care for the place, a love and intimate understanding of the land and water, and the intertwining of one’s identity with a place through investment in the land,” the report reads.
Many of these communities are also highly connected and feel a strong sense of social “unity,” as Edwards puts it. On top of this making the communities easy to rally, it has led to a strong awareness in regional communities that transmission planning practices, and more broadly national energy laws and objectives, largely neglect to consider environmental and social impacts in the early stages. 
Australia’s current transmission planning model primarily looks at cost with any transmission projects over $500 million passing through what’s called a Regulatory Investment Test. The test looks at ‘gross benefit’, meaning benefit for the market, as well as the construction and operation costs. To arrive at the final ‘net benefit’ of the project, the construction cost is subtracted from the ‘gross benefit’, Edwards says, noting the model recognised as bereft by the communities themselves.
When one considers why we are transitioning to renewable energy in first place (to protect the environment) the fact that environmental impacts aren’t considered in the Regulatory Investment Test “makes it laughable,” Edwards says.
“Acknowledging that the regulatory environment is not fit for purpose, proceeding with existing projects developed under current framework is akin to building a home without solid foundations,” the report reads.
“No amount of filler or paint (often referred to as an Environmental Effects/Impact Statements) will hide the cracks that have appeared or prevent the long-term consequences of not getting the framework right from the start. And as communities have strongly indicated, no amount of financial incentive will compensate for planning oversights.”
The report points to some of the groups opposing transmission which have gained traction in Australia, including S.O.L.V.E Tasmania (opposing UPC-TasNetworks transmission line), Stop HumeLink Towers (opposing TransGrid’s HumeLink in NSW), Stop AusNet’s Towers (opposing the Western Victoria Transmission Network Project), Merriwa-Cassilis Alliance (opposing Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone Transmission project in NSW), Gippsland Farmers (opposing the transmission line connecting Gippslands REZ in Victoria.
“Pushing the ‘talk to them early and pay them more’ agenda is very likely to further dilute trust, increase opposition and dissolve any credible opportunity to acquire social licence,” the report says.
“What energy investors and consumers need and what many are calling for is an architect with a set of blueprints, supported by rules and regulations that consider the Triple Bottom Line (TBL), to deliver the best technical, social and environmental solutions and redefine our energy future.
“The transition to renewables and acquisition of social licence could benefit from regulators who can factor in social, economic, emission and environmental impacts – rather than solely focusing on net benefits and least-cost to all those who produce, consume and transport electricity. This will minimise planning risks and create returns to the climate, business, industry, society, environment and the economy.”

Charge and discharge cycles in lithium-ion batteries cause anode volumes to change, reducing battery capacity and cycle life. Now, researchers at GIST in South Korea have developed a new way to strengthen the anode and modify it, regardless of its material or how it is manufactured.
Over time, charging and discharging causes the nanoparticles in the anode to crack and cluster together at the electrode-electrolyte interface. This leads to an electrical disconnection, reducing the amount of charge the anode can store or transport. To address this issue, GIST researchers have developed a method to make the anode more resilient against volume changes by encapsulating the nanoparticles in an elastic web-like structure.
The researchers described in Journal of Materials Chemistry A how they used a conventional anode containing silicon nanoparticles held together by a polymer (polyvinylidene fluoride) binder. To accommodate the web-like structure, they removed the binder by heating the anode using an annealing process.
The gap between the nanoparticles was then filled in with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) solution, which dried up to form a web that held the silicon nanoparticles together and prevented them from cracking. Additionally, the web provided a conductive pathway for the electrons, allowing the nanoparticles to bind with lithium.
The researchers used a technique called “spin coating” to coat the anode surface with rGO. The rGO coating served as a seed layer for the deposition of a protective layer consisting of zinc oxide with magnesium and gallium metal oxides added to it (MGZO). This MGZO layer provided structural stability to the anode.
“The structure retained a high storage capacity of 1566 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles and showed 91% coulombic efficiency, which relates to the battery life. This could pave the way for electric vehicles that enable us to drive long distances on one-time charging,” said Prof. Hyeong-Jin Kim, who joined GIST after serving as president of LG Chem Michigan.

A large quantity of solar panels have been detained by US customs under enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA).
Philip Shen, the managing director of ROTH Capital Partners, said an industry contact reports that as much as 3 GW have been held since the law has been enacted. As much as 9 GW to 12 GW of solar modules could be prevented from entering the US market by the end of the year, said Shen.
The Xinjiang region of China, which is home to 50% of the global supply of polysilicon, has come under scrutiny for its human rights abuses and the forced labor of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China. Beijing has repeatedly denied allegations of forced labor.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) said developers across the United States plan to install 17.8 GW of capacity this year. However, through six months, only 4.2 GW has been installed and brought online as module supply challenges led to cancellations and delays. Ongoing module supply challenges may continue to hamper deployment.
The UFLPA was passed last December and was first enacted this summer. The law bans all imports from the Chinese region of Xinjiang unless the products are determined to not be connected to forced labor.
To be in compliance with UFLPA, companies must provide a comprehensive supply chain mapping, a complete list of all workers at an entity subject to “rebuttable presumption” that there is a connection to forced labor, and proof that workers were not subject to conditions typical of forced labor practices and are there voluntarily.
“The world and the American people cannot abide the presence of goods made under the exploitative conditions experienced by Uyghur and other ethnic minority groups in its global supply chains,” said US Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh.
