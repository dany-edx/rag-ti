Singapore-based Sun Cable is seeking to develop a massive solar PV and battery complex on a 12,000-hectare site at Powell Creek in the NT’s Barkly region. The project includes a solar farm with up to 20GW of solar generation and between 36GWh and 42GWh of energy storage.
Once operational, the intercontinental project will supply power to Darwin and to Singapore via a 4,200-kilometre high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission network, including a 750km overhead transmission line from the solar farm to Darwin and a 3,800km submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore. The project is expected to generate enough renewable electricity to power more than 3 million homes a year.
The project, which is anticipated will provide 800MW of dispatchable renewable energy capacity to the Darwin region from 2026 and up to 15% of Singapore’s electricity needs from 2027, has already secured key approvals with the Australian federal government awarding it Major Project Status while the Indonesian government has approved the submarine transmission cable route and granted approval to undertake the next stage of the subsea cable survey.
The Territory government has already signed a Project Development Agreement (PDA) which allows it to work in partnership with Sun Cable to finalise land tenure and commercial arrangements for the AAPowerLink but it has now moved to provide the developers with even more surety.
The NT government said the Solar Project (Australia-Asia Power Link) (Special Provisions) Bill 2022 to be introduced into parliament this week will provide certainty that key commitments in its PDA with Sun Cable will be met.
“The legislation will clarify and streamline existing processes, increase project certainty, and support Sun Cable to secure project financing,” the government said in a statement.

Chief Minister Michael Gunner said the project will be a major economic driver, and it will put the Territory on the international map when it comes to renewables.
“The legislation provides certainty for the project and facilitates its implementation which will create over 1,750 jobs during construction and 350 ongoing positions as part of operations,” he said.
Sun Cable chief executive David Griffin welcomed the introduction of the Solar Project Bill 2022, saying it will deliver increased security for “a pioneer project that will position the Territory as a world leader in the intercontinental transmission of renewable electricity”.
“This bill provides certainty that key commitments from the Project Development Agreement will be met,” he said.
The Territory government’s announcement comes less than two weeks after Sun Cable revealed it had raised $210 million in a Series B capital raise. Iron ore magnate Andrew Forrest, through his private company Squadron Energy, and tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures were among the existing investors to take part.
Sun Cable has said construction for the project will begin immediately after financial close in October 2023 with commercial operations to commence in 2027.
Construction of the key elements of the AAPowerLink project is expected to begin in early 2024 with the first power to be supplied to Darwin in 2026. The first supply of electricity to Singapore is expected in 2027 with full capacity expected by the end of 2028.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/28/uq-researchers-promise-lifespan-boost-for-lithium-ion-batteries/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 28, 2022",UQ researchers promise lifespan boost for lithium-ion batteries,"A team of researchers from The University of Queensland (UQ) has designed an atomic-thin cathode material that reduces corrosion in lithium-ion batteries and has demonstrated improved high-voltage cycling stability with capacity retention of almost 80% after 1,000 cycles.
Professor Lianzhou Wang said he and his team from the School of Chemical Engineering and Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) have demonstrated a rechargeable lithium-ion battery which remains stable for more than 1,000 cycles.
“We’ve designed a uniquely-grown atomic-thin functional layer on the surface of a high-voltage cathode, which is the source of lithium ions and a critical aspect that limits the cycle life in a battery,” he said.
“This new approach features a minimal protective coating at a scalable process, paving the way for the deployment of these abundant high-voltage materials for next generation high energy batteries.”
Wang said corrosion in one form or another is the primary reason that batteries degrade but the new process would increase the life-span of batteries in everything from smart phones to electric vehicles (EVs).
The new technology involves the application of an epitaxially-engineered wetting layer on a lithium nickel manganese oxide (LNMO) cathode material. The research team said the atomic-thin wetting layer offers long-term suppression of the transition metal dissolution from the cathode without impacting its dynamics.
Wang said when tested in full lithium-ion coin cell configuration the coated LNMO, in combination with a graphite anode and a non-aqueous electrolyte solution, enables a capacity retention of about 77% after 1,000 cycles at 290mAg−1 and a final discharge capacity of about 80mAhg−1 with an average coulombic efficiency (CE) >99%.

Wang said with industry under increasing pressure to decarbonise, the development of lithium-ion batteries of lower cost, higher energy density and longer cycle life is vitally important.
“We’re confident the nanotechnology will have widespread applications across industry, including in consumer electronics, electric vehicles and the energy storage sector,” he said.
Dr Rosalind Gummow, technical specialist with Brisbane-based company VSPC, which is focused on developing and commercialising advanced cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, welcomed the development.
“New methods like the use of epitaxial surface layers to improve the cycling efficiency and cycle life of high-voltage cathodes are vital in the quest to improve the energy density of Li-ion batteries,” she said.
“The methods developed here also have potential to stabilise other cathode materials that degrade rapidly with cycling.”
The findings were published in the paper “Epitaxial growth of an atom-thin layer on a LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode for stable Li-ion battery cycling,” in the journal Nature Communications.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/28/state-election-day-chills-south-australia-hit-9934-mwh-on-19-march/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",,"MARCH 28, 2022","State election day chills; South Australia hit $9,934/MWh on 19 March","This remarkable wind penetration level, i.e., ~2140MW of total wind capacity, can however occasionally act as a double-edged sword when wind contribution is not as usual in meeting the demand, putting South Australia (SA) in an unpleasant circumstance.
Although enough local and interconnector capacity is in place to save the day and meet the demand in such an event, it can be at a significantly high cost.
In this Chart of the Week, we take a closer look at South Australia’s electricity prices during state election day on Saturday 19 March 2022, where wind generation was very low, resulting in $9,934/MWh of electricity price at 6.15pm.
It was the second time in March that distillate became online with $1811/MWh of average value this time.
The chart below shows SA’s energy balance figures on 19 March 2022, including:
From the left-hand side chart, we can see that the total wind generation has reduced from ~20GWh on Friday to ~9.7GWh on Saturday, which indicates a low generation rate, mostly due to the sudden reduction in wind during the evening time with an average of ~90MW while morning wind generation was on average of ~600MW.
This reduction in wind generation was enough to put SA in a net importer role on Saturday 19 March, importing ~9.7GWh from Victoria through both V-SA and V-S-MNSP1.
This shows the dependency of SA on interconnector capacity when the local wind generation is low. Accordingly, any interconnector constraint can pose a noticeable effect on SA’s prices and its local dispatch in such event.
A great example of such an event is seen at the right-hand side of the chart where the interconnector flow reduced by 40MW at 6.15pm Saturday (regarding export limits from Victoria, while interconnector flow was maxed out), resulting in more local supply being required where distillate becomes online, pushing the price up to $9,934/MWh.

This observation is a great example of SA’s challenge in meeting its demand when wind is installed strongly but dead on some days.
According to the dispatch history, batteries could not do much during this event as the installed battery capacity in SA is not large (only 1.5% contribution in supplying demand on 19 March 2022).
Such observation indicates that it is still necessary to identify methods/technologies to enable cheaper generation capacity (such as batteries) during low wind periods to avoid price spikes.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/28/nsw-outlines-plans-for-2-5gw-renewable-energy-zone-in-states-southwest/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 28, 2022",NSW outlines plans for 2.5GW renewable energy zone in state’s southwest,"The New South Wales (NSW) government has published a draft declaration for the South-West Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), one of five designated clean energy areas detailed in the state government’s electricity roadmap which would bring 12GW of renewable energy and 2GW of storage online by 2030.
The draft declaration published on Friday details the intended capacity, geographical area and required network infrastructure that will make up the South-West REZ which is centred around the town of Hay in the western Riverina region.
The Energy Corporation of NSW (EnergyCo), the statutory authority established by the NSW government to lead the delivery of the state’s REZs, said the declaration is the first step in formalising the REZ under the Electricity Infrastructure Investment Act 2020.
EnergyCo said the capacity of the South-West REZ will be no less than 2.5GW with the area chosen due to “an abundance of high-quality wind and solar resources”, relative land-use compatibility, an exisiting strong pipeline of proposed projects and its proximity to project EnergyConnect.
The region is traversed by the 900-kilometre EnergyConnect project, an interconnector being built by network operators Transgrid and ElectraNet between Wagga Wagga in NSW and Robertstown in South Australia, with a connection to Red Cliffs in Victoria. The project will also upgrade the 330kV transmission line to 500kV between Wagga Wagga and Dinawan, which links to the eastern edge of the South-West REZ.
EneryCo said the EnergyConnect project will support the South-West REZ by unlocking up to 1.2GW of additional transmission capacity.
Developers have already demonstrated a keen interest in the South-West REZ, with the state government revealing in February it had received a “huge” response to the registration of interest (ROI) process.
EnergyCo chief executive officer James Hay said 49 wind, solar PV and energy storage registrations were received totalling more than 34GW of generation and storage – 13 times the intended capacity for the South-West REZ.

In the wake of that response, EnergyCo conducted a review of the submissions and has since refined the geographic boundary of the South-West REZ.
EnergyCo said the eastern and northern boundaries have been retracted to “balance interactions with existing land uses and provide a balance between the maintenance of reasonable connection distances to planned transmission infrastructure and opportunities to unlock new energy generation in areas with strong resource potential”.
“We have worked with a range of stakeholders to prepare the draft declaration in a way that considers local priorities and values, land-use planning, investor interest and the legislative requirements,” EnergyCo said.
“The refined boundary for the South-West REZ geographic area seeks to deliver a balanced and optimal outcome, considering the likely technical and economic feasibility issues for renewable energy and storage project developments, network infrastructure considerations, land-use constraints, and stakeholder views.”
While the South-West REZ is to deliver at least 2.5GW of new network capacity, EnergyCo said the final declaration, which is expected to be announced later this year, could specify additional generation, storage and network infrastructure.
The South-West REZ is one of five REZs planned to help replace the state’s ageing coal-fired power stations, with four of its five fossil-fuelled power plants expected to close in the next 15 years, starting with the 1,680MW Liddell Power Station in 2023-24.
REZs will also be developed in the New England, Hunter-Central Coast, Illawarra and Central-West Orana regions and are expected to bring 12GW of renewable energy and 2GW of storage online.
EnergyCo said the South-West REZ is a significant undertaking and will take several years to plan, design and build and will most likely be delivered in stages.
The state government is seeking feedback on the draft declaration which will remain on exhibition until 22 April 2022.
