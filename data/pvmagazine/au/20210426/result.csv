The paper, just published in the Journal of Building Engineering, compares the generating capacity of 21 Leased Federal Airports (LFAs) around Australia with the generating capacity of 17,000 installed residential solar rooftop PV panels in the City of Greater of Bendigo.
It found that solar panels installed on suitable roof space at Melbourne Airport alone would outperform Bendigo’s annual solar electricity production by almost 12 GWh a year; and that the combined output of the Commonwealth Government-administered airports would generate 10 times more than Bendigo’s residential fleet.
Geospatial scientist and researcher on the study, Dr Chayn Sun, said the team’s findings highlighted the necessity for energy policies to include plans for installing solar panels at the airport properties.
“We can’t rely on small residential solar to get us to a zero-emission economy”, but large installations on buildings such as airports “would get us a lot closer”, she said.
Of course some airports have already landed on solar as a means to reduce energy costs and emissions: Brisbane Airport Corporation (BAC), for example, contracted Epho (recently acquired by AGL) to install 6 MW of solar across a large portion of its rooftops back in 2018; it also has plans to install a further 5 MWs by 2025.
BAC reports that in the financial year to end of June 2020 its solar arrays generated 9.72 GWh of renewable energy, which represents around 18% of the facility’s annual energy consumption.
RMIT’s Investigating potential rooftop solar energy generated by Leased Federal Airports in Australia: Framework and implications study estimates the solar capacity of Brisbane airport at around 60 GWh per annum, so its potential remains greatly under-exploited.

Adelaide Airport sports a 1.17 MW solar-covered car park, installed by Solgen Energy Group in 2016, which completely provides for the energy needs of the short-term parking facility, and brought the total generation of Adelaide Airport rooftop solar to 1.28 MW.
RMIT shows that the aviation gateway to South Australia is capable of generating around 25 GWh of solar energy each year.
“Based on our solar radiation analysis, we know airports with decent solar systems could not only be self-sufficient, but would generate enough electricity to send excess back to the grid,” said Sun.
In the first phase of the study, lead author Athenee Teofilo, a Master of Geospatial Science student, mapped the buildings at each of the 21 LFAs, excluding unsuitable structures such as domed and blister-type hangar roofs — and identified 2.61 square kilometres of useable space.
Researchers then used a Geographic Information System to determine the optimum tilt angle for solar arrays at each site, to maximise theoretical yield, before calculating that output.
Perth Airport topped the chart, with the estimated potential to use its rooftops to generate almost 95 GWh of clean electricity each year — almost twice the solar output of Greater Bendigo, and the equivalent of estimated production from Adelaide, Sydney, Moorabbin and Townsville airports combined.
At LFAs such as sun-seared Alice Springs and Tennant Creek, where the buildings themselves aren’t suited to solar installation, the study suggests installing ground-mounted solar, a strategy which has already been deployed to some extent at these airports and beyond.
In 2016, Darwin International Airport installed 4 MW of ground-mounted solar across six unused hectares of land on site, and a further 1.6 MW across various rooftops, and is poised to install a further 4 MW across other buildings at the site occupied by Bunnings the Cold Store Facility, Osgood South Business Park, the airport terminal itself and its carparks.
Melbourne Airport, aka Tullamarine, went big on the ground-mounted solar concept during COVID, commissioning Beon Energy Solutions to develop a solar farm of some 12.4 MW capacity, and subsequently stole the silicon mantle from Brisbane for the largest behind-the-meter solar installation of any Australian airport.
Its new installation will generate 17 GWh of clean energy each year, enough to provide almost 15% of the airport’s needs.
But RMIT puts Tullamarine’s annual capacity for rooftop generation alone at 70 GWh.

The Clean Energy Australia Report 2021, released by the Clean Energy Council at the end of March this year, calculates that 27.7% of the country’s electricity generation now comes from renewable sources; the remaining 72.3% is produced by fossil fuels.
The RMIT study says that even with a laudable 17,000 solar panels, the City of Greater Bendigo is only cleanly generating a fifth of its needs.
Such figures bolster the case, say the RMIT scientists, for policies that blanket suitable Federally controlled infrastructure with solar, to make some big leaps in emission reductions.
They calculate that 151.6 kilotons of greenhouse gases could be displaced by solar installed across the 21 LFAs.
Commonwealth Government leadership in this domain, and perhaps incentives for the country’s 150 private airports to also put land and buildings to solar-generating use would have an even greater cumulative effect.
As major electricity users, with grid connections, and located close to other significant urban electricity loads; as generally unshaded sites with uninterrupted access to solar radiation, airports are a natural, defined subset of commercial electricity users with rooftop real estate to spare.
The RMIT University group’s low-cost methodology of “rooftop feature digitisation, followed by the calculation of solar electricity that considers a shade-free arrangement using GIS technologies” (as described in the paper) is applicable to other such groupings.
It concludes, “With increasing demand for electricity, there is a need for new alternative sources in the renewable industry … to ensure that the government remains pursuant in fulfilling their goal to reduce the Australian greenhouse gas emissions,” such modelling systems could be well deployed to better identify opportunities and potentially direct funding support.

Distinguished guests,
I would like to commend President Biden for convening this Summit within 100 days of taking office. And I welcome the commitments to reduce emissions announced by so many countries.
It is clear that the level of commitment to fight climate change has never been higher. This is excellent news.
But I will be blunt: commitments alone are not enough. We need real change in the real world.
Right now, the data does not match the rhetoric – and the gap is getting wider.
Our latest estimates for CO2 emissions in 2021 are a warning for humanity. Emissions are on track for their second-largest increase in history.
We are not recovering from Covid in a sustainable way, and we remain on a path of dangerous levels of global warming.
Yet there are grounds for optimism.
Electricity generated from renewables will break records this year. And sales of electric cars will reach another record high.
But getting to net-zero emissions requires much more than that — we will need to transform our entire energy system.
This means drastically cutting emissions from trucks, ships and planes.
We will also need to do the same for steel and cement factories, chemical plants and in farming.
We have many technologies at our disposal today – energy efficiency, solar, wind, electric cars, nuclear power, and many more – and we need to deploy these as quickly as possible.
However, IEA analysis shows that about half the reductions to get to net zero emissions in 2050 will need to come from technologies that are not yet ready for market.
This calls for massive leaps in innovation. Innovation across batteries, hydrogen, synthetic fuels, carbon capture and many other technologies.
On 18 May, the International Energy Agency will release a roadmap for how the global energy sector can reach net zero by 2050.
Make no mistake – this is a herculean task.
Participants to this Summit have used the occasion to make new announcements.
Let me add one from the IEA.
According to our upcoming Roadmap, reaching net-zero will triple clean energy investment opportunities over the next decade.
This will generate millions of well-paid jobs and create the industries of the future.
But, our priority is to make sure these benefits reach as many people as possible.
We need to work together to achieve our goals and create a better future for all of us.

Initially helping to regulate the flow of the Australian Capital Territory’s 100% renewable electricity supply, it will soon also stream energy from a co-located 500 kW solar array, contribute to the operation of local virtual power plants, and integrate supply from locally generated green hydrogen.
It’s the first battery installation in Australia to supplement an urban power supply at scale, and was developed in line with the needs of ACT network distributor Evoenergy.
In an exclusive preview of the project, Elvin Group Renewables Managing Director, Samuel Blackadder told pv magazine that the battery is the demonstration project and first stage in Elvin Group’s ambitious national rollout of battery energy storage systems — or rather ecosystems — that will be adaptable to regional and urban conditions and utilising the best available local renewable energy resources.
Megapack is Tesla’s advance on the Powerpacks used at Neoen’s now famously successful Hornsdale Power Reserve, which recently added 50 MW/64.5 MWh capacity to its original 100 MW/129 MWh. It is calculated to have saved South Australian consumers some $150 million and stabilised the state’s grid in extreme conditions, while proving the commercial case for batteries delivering Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) to the National Electricity Market (NEM).
This first Australian Megapack arrived, as is the formula for this system, pre-assembled and pre-tested — including battery modules, bi-directional inverters, a thermal management system, an AC main breaker and controls in the one enclosure — from Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada.
“We went through due diligence with other battery manufacturers in Asia,” says Blackadder, who adds, “For us, and where we see our company heading, Tesla was the best fit for technology and support.”
The full business case for Elvin Group’s unique project has yet to be revealed as the company signs agreements with market participants in the next couple of weeks.

FCAS will play a part in commercialising the project, which was envisioned by Blackadder and members of the Elvin family around 12 months ago, in response to the threats that fire and extreme weather events posed to reliability of energy supply even as the Canberra population was known to be expanding and its energy needs increasing. 
Such factors, says Blackadder, “have increased the demands on reliable power supply throughout the ACT, and networks are looking for non-network options that help avoid extended brownouts/blackouts and fluctuating voltage.”
He says the project faced several challenges in recent months, partly due to its trailblazer status, but it helped that “Evoenergy is proud to be part of innovative projects and is really looking to assist decarbonisation of the grid”.
The battery has the capacity to provide the average energy needs of about 5,400 households in the Ginninderra and Holt region of the capital’s new suburbs for an hour, and “will also stand ready to pump energy into the grid in the event of a shortfall, making sharing between the ACT and New South Wales more efficient”, the company said in a statement released today.
Blackadder is also CEO of H2X Marine which is developing hydrogen-fuel-cell powered passenger vessels, and has trials of technology underway and in the offing, but Blackadder says the green hydrogen set to supplement the Canberra battery is separate to his endeavours in marine transportation.
Elvin Group itself is also involved in projects to develop some of Australia’s first hydrogen hubs along the east coast of New South Wales and Queensland. Blackadder says these will feature Australian developed electrolysers, which the company plans to manufacture in Canberra.
He says the point of including solar and hydrogen in Elvin Group’s first battery ecosystem is two-fold: to cater to ongoing growth in demand for clean electricity in Canberra; and to demonstrate to customers and other developers how to set up an integrated solution using batteries, although he says that despite the plug-and-play design of the Megapack, installing the battery in front of the meter triggered many extra requirements from the Australian Energy Market Operator.
Elvin Group’s potential pipeline of similar projects, some of which Blackadder has already scoped suitable sites for, includes battery systems for, urban, regional and remote Australia.
“We’re looking at projects that are on single-wire earth return (SWER) lines and in remote parts of Australia where there is no grid infrastructure, so having multiple streams of regeneration for the battery will be critical and we envisage needing a mix of solar, wind and potentially hydrogen,” he says.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/26/unsws-prof-martin-green-ups-pv-yield-by-cooling-solar-modules/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"APRIL 26, 2021",UNSW’s Prof Martin Green ups PV yield by cooling solar modules,"A decrease of 10 degrees Celsius in operating temperature could double the lifespan of solar panels and boost their performance every day. Researchers at the University of NSW have completed a successful desk-top study that modelled methods yielding an effective 2-3 degrees Celsius cooling of solar panels, and are following up with live experimental research to verify and expand on that effectiveness.
Although constantly exposed to heat, solar modules work better under cooler conditions.
In an exclusive interview with pv magazine Australia, UNSW’s Scientia Professor Martin Green, who is also Director for the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics, explained: 5 degrees Celsius reduction in operating temperature can yield a 2% improvement in module performance on a hot day; and the degradation which limits module lifespan and is largely catalysed by heat can also be mitigated by reducing their operating temperatures — five degrees reduction in operating temperature is expected to result in 50% increase in project life.
Results of the desktop study — led by UNSW Professor Renate Egan, partly funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and carried out in collaboration with 3M and solar system innovators 5B — were published at the end of March, and showed that of the novel methods explored for lowering the temperature of solar panels, “vortex generators” and glass texturing, have so far proved to be the most effective solutions.
“Glass texturing is an interesting approach,” says Green, “because people have looked at it before, but from the point of view of the visible optics — trapping more sunlight into the cells and things like that. We’re looking at it from the thermal point of view where texturing can improve the thermal emissivity of the module, that is it can improve radiative dissipation and its increased surface area can also improve convective losses.”
On the intriguing topic of vortex generators, he says that left to do their job in the sun, modules heat up by some 30 degrees Celsius. This generates airflows up the front and back surfaces of the module, and as the flow of air gets hotter along the back surface, it tends to get trapped against the module.
“It’s a nice laminar flow along the back, which you might want to be designing for in racing cars because you get minimum interaction with the surrounding air,” says Green. But it’s not good for heat transfer, or dissipating heat, for which he says “you want the air to be turbulent as it passes over the module”.
Vortex generators, aka small plastic “fins” added to the back of the solar panel, “break up the laminar flow of air and create regions of turbulence that can greatly increase heat transfer from local areas,” says Green.
The numerical study resulted in three patents being filed, and was extremely useful in establishing the feasibility of several approaches before proceeding to potentially costly physical testing.
It’s quite difficult to do measurements in the real world, says Green, “because cooling effects can be subtle”, but with the development of engineering simulation software such as COMSOL and Ansys systems used in this instance, researchers can test and adjust design approaches “until you’ve achieved a difference that’s big enough” to warrant investing more effort in experiments, says the Professor.
Solar innovators at 5B, renowned for their rapid-rollout PV systems which have been chosen to unfold across the 12,000 hectares (10 GW) of solar PV planned for Sun Cable’s Australia-ASEAN Power Link (AAPL) project near Elliott in the Northern Territory, have gathered highly accurate solar-performance data on their systems, which contributed to UNSW’s simulations.
Having developed its preassembled, relocatable solar system — appropriately called Maverick — that extends like mini-mountain ranges, across the ground, 5B has had to answer concerns that it might run slightly hotter than more elevated, conventionally mounted systems.

5B Chief Technology Officer, Rhett Evans, told pv magazine Australia, that the company collects large amounts of data to verify the performance of its technology under different conditions. 
As an industry partner to UNSW’s Module Design for Lowering Field Operating Temperature and Improved Yield Study, 5B made its data available to researchers, and iti will also participate in the subsequent round of experimental research.
“They’ve developed some really good methods for doing the thermal modelling in the first place,” Evans says of UNSW’s approach. He adds, “We want to be a party to that, using it to understand how we can make our specific products work better.”
3M has been a long-term partner of UNSW’s School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, and is involved in two of the study’s other streams of cool thought: heat conducting tape that channels heat generated on the solar panel to the cooler extremities of the frame; and more complex coatings than are currently applied to the glass of solar panels.
“I think probably 100% of modules now have anti-reflection coating on the top glass surface,” explains Green, “but we’re looking at coatings that will reduce unusable infrared light penetration.” This will improve the performance of the visible wavelength of light transformed into energy by solar panels, and at the same time improve the thermal performance of the module.
Although Green is shooting for 10 degrees Celsius thermal reduction in solar panels operating in full sunlight, he says going all out for the biggest reduction possible will then allow researchers to hone in on the most efficient methods to deliver 5 degrees reduction, and which can be incorporated into manufacture of solar panels.
“You don’t want to go too far from the beaten path,” says Green, “we want to minimise the the variation from what manufacturers feel comfortable with.”
Professor Egan says that a cost analysis of the two most successful cooling technologies to emerge from the desktop study revealed that the Vortex Generator technology could reduce the levelised cost of electricity generated by 5-8% if implemented as an add-on during manufacturing; a 2-3 degree Celsius cooling benefit would outweigh the estimated cost of $3-5 per square metre.
The Glass Texturing technology, in turn, could reduce the levelised cost of electricity by 3-15%. Although the benefit of this approach varies depending on the actual cooling effect — which is estimated to range from 1-5 degrees Celsius — its cost is very low at less than $0.4 per square metre.
In the experimental study, which will conclude at the end of 2022, Green hopes to gather data relevant to a variety of PV module types, mounting systems and applications, including rooftop solar, bifacial solar panels and 5B’s Maverick concertina systems.
Four of 5B’s module partners — Canadian Solar, JA Solar, Jinko and Longi — are also participating in UNSW’s experimental cooling study.
Green reminds pv magazine, that his colleague, the late Professor Stuart Wenham, “pioneered this consortium-type approach” to integrating research with industry.
“If you get a number of high-profile manufacturers involved” at the outset and they like the way things develop, he says, “then the whole industry is will follow because you’ve got some of the key players pushing in that direction”.
The benefit of this research to solar developers can mean a great deal: “People are worried about every percent, in relative terms of output that you get from the field,” says Green. Small gains in performance across large installations and in the high-output lifetime of a solar farm, “can make all the difference to a project’s success,” he says.
