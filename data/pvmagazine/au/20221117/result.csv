The plan features a 10 MW electrolyser supported by at least 100 MW of solar.
Under the terms of the non-binding agreement Countrywide and Anantara will jointly study the feasibility of establishing a solar-powered green hydrogen production facility in Indonesia’s Riau archipelago, south of Singapore.
Anantara Director Simon Bell said he expects green hydrogen and ammonia produced from renewable energy will play a key role in a future net-zero economy for Indonesia and the region more broadly. This is in addition to the demand he believes will emerge from Europe as a key export market for Indonesia.
“We have agreed to collaborate with Countrywide Hydrogen to jointly conduct and fund a concept study and a detailed techno-commercial feasibility study for the set up of a green hydrogen production facility, and the viability of investing in the development of commercial arrangements for clean hydrogen in Indonesia,” he said.
The planned concept and feasibility studies will explore an initial 10 MW electrolyser capable of producing approximately 1,650 tonnes of green hydrogen per year. If supported by the feasibility study, Anantara will develop, fund, and operate at least 100 MW of solar to provide clean energy to the facility.

ReNu Executive Director and Countrywide Managing Director Geoffrey Drucker said it is expected the solar-powered facility would supply green hydrogen to offtakers in Indonesia. Once local demand is met, supply can then be directed for export to other countries in Asia and potentially Europe.
“Green hydrogen will play a major role in a future net-zero economy for Indonesia and Asia more broadly, creating emission-free power generation, transportation for mining, and industrial processes,” Drucker said. “We plan to meet the needs of a competitive market, and this production facility will continuously expand to reach a broader ASEAN market through an agreed energy export scheme.
Subject to a positive outcome of the studies, it is expected the financial close for the green hydrogen manufacturing facility could occur in 2024 with green hydrogen production to commence in 2025.
Anantara has already committed to invest up to almost $9 billion (USD 6 billion) to develop a 3.5 GW solar and storage facility in Riau. The joint venture has secured more than 600 hectares of land and is in the process of obtaining permitting rights as well as financing commitments for developing a 3.5 GW solar plant with up to 12 GWh of energy storage capacity.
The PV plant is expected to generate an estimated 4 TWh of clean energy annually for the purpose of providing baseload clean energy to the local population and industry. Anantara also intends to export clean energy to Singapore via an undersea cable.
The agreement with Anantara comes after Countrywide last week signed a term sheet with Australian superannuation fund HESTA for an investment of up to $100 million in the company’s green hydrogen projects and just hours after the company announced it would work with the operators of Launceston Airport in Tasmania to investigate the development of a multi-purpose green hydrogen project at the airport.

Countrywide will investigate the feasibility of installing approximately 20 MW of solar on vacant airport land to provide behind-the-meter electricity to power a 5 MW electrolyser to produce green hydrogen.
Drucker said the use of solar power in the production process would help minimise the cost of hydrogen production as well as the price of green hydrogen supplied to customers, making the emission-free fuel as competitive and attractive as possible.
“We are incredibly excited by the number of complementary hub opportunities this collaboration could afford northern Tasmania, including on-site hydrogen refuelling for bus and truck operators looking to decarbonise their vehicle fleet, while offering fuel cell vehicle servicing, maintenance and upskilling diesel mechanics and technicians,” he said.
Launceston Airport Chief Executive Shane O’Hare said if found feasible, the project would support the company’s ambitious emissions reductions targets.
“We have set a target of net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025, and this project could help us to achieve that through the provision of solar-powered electricity,” he said. “It could also support our vision to develop a logistics hub at Western Junction encompassing road, rail and air.”
Preliminary works to be investigated as part of the Launceston Airport feasibility study include concept design and financial modelling, land use and access, off-take arrangements and discussions with other potential stakeholders. Initial works are due to start before 2022’s end.

CuString Managing Director Joseph O’Brien said the federal government approval has been granted under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act and follows the Queensland government’s recent approval of the project’s environmental impact statement.
“With the federal and state government environmental approvals and appropriate conditions in place, CopperString is the most advanced major electricity transmission project under development, and it can be shovel ready imminently,” O’Brien told Newscorp.
Hailed as the largest geographical expansion of the National Electricity Market (NEM) since it was established, the $2.5 billion (USD 1.6 billion) project would provide connection options for mining and industrial customers in the region and open up enormous tracts of land previously closed to solar and wind development.
“CopperString will be the first mover in building major transmission that links directly to the critical minerals and renewable energy drivers of global decarbonisation, and it will be the largest and most impactful expansion of the 40,000-km NEM since it commenced almost 25 years ago,” O’Brien said.
“CopperString is the key to developing Australia’s critical mineral potential in North West Minerals Province and building the clean industrial ecosystem across the Townsville to Mount Isa corridor that already exports refined zinc, copper and other minerals to the world, and is home to Australia’s best renewable energy resources.”
While O’Brien described the latest approvals as a major milestone for the project, no start date for construction has yet been determined. Though the early contractor involvement process has already been completed.
“We would like to start work in 2023,” O’Brien added. “We are ready to build.”
CopperString is expected to create up to 800 full-time equivalent jobs during construction and support up to 100 jobs ongoing in operations and maintenance for the asset. However, the economic benefits, such as the development of new large-scale wind and solar projects, are forecast to translate into an additional 3,500 full-time equivalent jobs by 2050.
“Over 3,000 MW of new renewable generation projects have commenced grid connection process via CopperString for access to the NEM,” O’Brien said.

The renewable energy will be sourced from Spanish developer X-Elio’s 200 MW Blue Grass Solar Farm near Chinchilla in Queensland’s Western Downs region and the 450 MW first stage of the Clarke Creek wind project being built by Windlab northwest of Rockhampton.
Anglo American, Australia’s second largest metallurgical coal miner, said the deal will power all electrical equipment at its mines in Moranbah, Middlemount and Moura, including draglines, longwall equipment, conveyors, coal preparation facilities, lighting and ventilation and cooling infrastructure, water treatment plant and administration facilities.
Chief executive of Anglo American in Australia, Dan van der Westhuizen, said the power purchase agreement would effectively remove all Scope 2 emissions from the miner’s steelmaking coal business in Australia from 2025 and would accelerate its aim of carbon neutral operations by 2040.
“Securing 100% renewables from Stanwell is a major step towards our target of carbon neutral operations in Australia, and globally, by 2040,” he said. Before adding that many of the metals and minerals Anglo American produces, including steelmaking coal, are critical to the energy transition. Evidently the miner considers itself a necessary evil in this regard.
“We are committed to playing our part against climate change, including through renewable energy use and accelerating a number of technologies to abate our on-site emissions,” Westhuizen said. “Today’s deal brings significant environmental benefits and is NPV positive compared with our current energy mix, while underwriting a large investment in renewable energy generation for Queensland.”
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the partnership between Anglo American and Stanwell, historically known only for coal-fired energy generation, demonstrated the strong shift to clean energy from Queensland businesses.
The announcement comes just days after Stanwell, through its retail arm Stanwell Energy, inked a deal to supply up to 185 GWh of renewable energy a year to help power the Brisbane Airport Corporation’s operations.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/17/queensland-council-plots-path-from-coal-hub-to-renewable-energy-superpower/,"HYDROGEN,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 17, 2022",Queensland council plots path from coal hub to green superpower,"Gladstone Regional Council has launched a 10-year economic transition roadmap outlining a plan to help the industrial centre to thrive in a decarbonising world, navigate the shift away from an economy tied to fossil fuels and manage the impacts associated with new energy industries.
Council said the Gladstone Region Economic Transition Roadmap will guide it on what is required to adapt to a rapidly changing energy sector and support a positive economic transition for its community over the coming decade.
“The Gladstone region is facing a major economic transformation as industries grapple with the decarbonisation of the global economy,” the report says. “The purpose of the roadmap is to inform and guide council on what is required to support the region to successfully adapt to a changing energy sector over the next decade, alongside other levels of government and industry.”
Developed in partnership with regional economic development agency, The Next Economy, the 166-page document is a result of two years of research and extensive engagement involving 220 community, government and industry stakeholders.
The Next Economy Chief Executive Officer Amanda Cahill said the roadmap will position the Gladstone region, home to alumina smelters, liquified natural gas (LNG) and coal exports, and fossil fuel-fired power stations to respond to once-in-a-generation changes in the energy sector.
“This project is the first of its kind in Australia using an inclusive and interactive planning process to engage such a diverse group of stakeholders to tackle the challenges and opportunities of energy transition,” she said. “The roadmap will enable Gladstone Regional Council to lead and work with industry, government and the community to navigate changes on the horizon that directly impact the local economy.”
The roadmap identifies six key areas that the council could play a part in, including energy security, establishing a viable hydrogen industry, economic diversification, workforce development, community benefits and environmental protection.
Gladstone Region Mayor Matt Burnett said most of the roadmap’s recommendations centre around the council’s advocacy role, as well its connections with industry, the community, and other levels of government.
Burnett said council’s decision to endorse the roadmap will allow it to determine the region’s future, with council having already started to identify how they can integrate recommendations into other council plans, working out budget line items and staff.
“It places us in pole position to capitalise on the economic opportunities of new energy industries, while also ensuring our region maintains its industrial heritage and community vitality in a new transitioned economy,” he said.
“Council understands how vital it is to continue working with our communities and stakeholders to diversify the region’s economy for long-term prosperity. This roadmap helps us determine what needs to be done to realise this vision.”

While other regions in Australia are also experiencing the impact of changes in the energy sector, the report suggests the Gladstone area is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of decarbonisation.
The region has an economic dependence on a range of carbon-intensive industries, including the production of alumina and aluminium, LNG, and is home to the coal-fired NRG Gladstone and Callide B power stations, both of which face potential closure within the next 10 years. The region also derives significant revenue from exporting fossil fuels with the port handling 25% of Australia’s LNG and 40% of its coal exports.
While the risks of a changing energy sector are significant given the region’s economic ties to carbon-intensive industries, the roadmap recognises it also enjoys several competitive advantages over other regions in the race to net-zero emissions. An existing industrial base, strong supply chains, a skilled workforce, and access to lucrative Asian markets through the port makes the region attractive to a range of new investors and industries.
“Gladstone’s existing industrial base and growing availability of low-cost renewable energy means that the region is also well positioned to benefit from the energy transition,” the report says. “There are opportunities to expand and diversify the region’s economic base and take advantage of opportunities such as green manufacturing and hydrogen production.”
The region is already attracting significant investment in renewable energy generation, green hydrogen and the manufacturing of renewable energy equipment. Fortescue Future Industries, a subsidiary of miner Fortescue Metals Group, has already gained planning approval to establish a 2 GW renewable energy infrastructure-manufacturing facility at Aldoga,

Fellow mining giant Rio Tinto received offers to build more than 4 GW of solar and wind capacity in response to a formal market Request for Proposals as part of its plan to transition the energy needs of its three production assets in the Gladstone region – the Boyne smelter, the Yarwun alumina refinery and the Queensland Alumina refinery – to renewables by 2030.
The region is also on its way to becoming a green hydrogen mecca with several ambitious projects already in the pipeline, including Hydrogen Utility’s proposal to establish up to 3 GW in electrolysis plant, and up to 5,000 tonnes per day ammonia production capacity.
London-based Eco Energy World is planning a $500 million project combining a 300 MW solar plant with a 200 MW hydrogen plant and 100 MW of battery energy storage. And Japanese trading giant Sumitomo Corporation has signed a signed a contract with an EPC for a solar-powered green hydrogen production plant in the regional centre.
Cahill said the roadmap will allow council to navigate the transition and maximise the benefits for the wider community.
“The Gladstone region is particularly well positioned to take advantage of new economic opportunities as we shift to new energy solutions, but we also need to plan ahead to manage the potential impacts on the regional economy, community and the environment,” she said. “We can shape these in ways that benefit all three.”

The first two stages of the project tested the use of solar and battery storage systems along with Virtual Power Plant (VPP) technology across 60 public schools.
Now the NSW government has opened an Expressions of Interest (EOI) process for proposals to finance, deliver and operate renewable energy systems across 2,200 public schools across the state.
School Infrastructure NSW, which manages the Smart Energy Schools Pilot Project, believes such a solution could be facilitated as part of a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), though it is open to alternative models. For instance, proposals may include the management of electric vehicle charging or other such behind the meter solutions.
A project of this size could have a significant impact if integrated with emerging vehicle-to-grid technology. According to a statement from the NSW government, this EOI process could prove the largest exercise of its kind in Australia – the largest in terms of the number of potential behind the meter sites, and in terms of volume.
“With roof space equivalent to around 500 Sydney Cricket Grounds available across 2,200 NSW public schools, this exercise will help us harness the power potential of our schools,” said NSW Treasurer and Minister for Energy Matt Kean.
However, Kean noted the necessity to “be smart about how we finance and operate these resources so we maximise the financial returns for NSW and help make the electricity system more secure.”
NSW Minister for Education and Early Learning Sarah Mitchell added that the ultimate goal of the project is to “reduce our state’s carbon emissions, cut school electricity costs and help students to learn more about renewable energy.”
The NSW government asks that non-binding proposals be submitted by the end of 2022, with shortlisted respondents to be invited into a final offer process in 2023. Interested parties can register their proposals here.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/17/new-algorithm-to-identify-underperforming-strings-in-pv-systems/,"INVERTERS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 17, 2022",New algorithm to identify underperforming strings in PV systems,"Scientists from the Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH research institution in Germany have developed a self-referencing algorithm to detect and quantify underperformance in PV installations. The researchers described the novel algorithm as an alternative to standard performance ratio (PR) analysis, which describes the relationship between actual and theoretical energy outputs of a PV plant. They said it uses a PV system’s string with maximum output as a reference.
“The output of other strings is set in relation to the corresponding value of the reference string, resulting in a quantity we call self-referencing ratio (SR),” the scientists explained. “We benchmark this ratio against the established performance ratio, which requires solar irradiance data for calculation.”
The group tested the new approach on a 9 MW PV power station in Germany. The facility, which has been operational since 2011, features three-phase inverters deployed across 1,719 strings.
“The three strings belonging to one inverter are installed on one mounting rack, located in three rows,” the scientists said.
They corroborated their testing with IR imaging and a voltage analysis and found that the new algorithm can predict and identify string yield losses or underperforming strings without additional weather data. They claimed their self-referencing method can identify local differences due to plant layout and the aging of components. It can also be used to inspect solar modules, strings, arrays, inverters, and transformers.
“Losses beyond expected degradation can be estimated and function as a basis for O&M decisions,” said the scientists. “We expect further advantages by applying the self-referencing method for degradation studies of time-series and root-cause analysis with machine learning and combination with different data sources, for example, imaging data.”
The academics described the new approach in “Assessment of string performance using self-referencing method in comparison to performance ratio,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
