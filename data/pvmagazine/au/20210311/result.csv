https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/11/100-renewables-a-year-in-practice/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",,"MARCH 11, 2021",100% Renewables – A year in practice,"On New Years Day 2020, City of Newcastle (CN) officially switched over to 100% renewable electricity supply for all its operations, including all of our large sites such as libraries, galleries, administration centres and works depots, over 200 small sites and more than 14,000 street lights. Four days into the contract, we faced a significant test, with chaotic events sending the spot market price to $14,700 per megawatt hour, more than 165 times the previous year spot price average. I covered this event in detail in a previous post here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-local-energy-resilience-adam-clarke/ and while we did relatively well out of this singular event, I was more interested to see how we’d track over the long term.
Implementing a 100% renewable electricity contract
To explain briefly how our 100% renewable contract works, CN purchases electricity for its operations through an electricity retailer as part of an Energy Supply Agreement (ESA). Instead of being at a fixed price, it is purchased from the spot market which operates on a half-hourly basis. At the same time, CN has a supplementary agreement with its electricity retailer to buy the same amount of electricity from a renewable energy generator (in this case Sapphire wind farm).
This is otherwise known as a Retail power purchase agreement (PPA), Renewable PPA or a Virtual Generation Agreement (VGA).
Figure 01 – City of Newcastle Electricity Contracts
While it may look a bit complex, in practice, the ins and outs are all managed by an electricity retailer. This means that as a customer, CN receives a bill each month for our sites, as we would with any standard electricity bill.
Comparing our progress on a 100% renewable electricity contract compared to a standard agreement (or Business as usual) is where it gets interesting. Are renewables cheaper or more expensive? What is our exposure risk to fluctuating electricity prices instead of fixed prices? How often is the wind not blowing or the sun not shining? What else can we do to manage our electricity use?
First, the finances
Our business case modelling prior to signing a renewable energy contract had shown good prospects of not only supporting renewables but also achieving significant financial savings on our electricity contract. Having now had over a full year of actual data (albeit in interesting circumstances due to Covid-19), the case continues to stack up for our new approach to energy management. Despite a volatile January 2020 period and a few more blips throughout the year, City of Newcastle is tracking well ahead of its business-as-usual (BAU) projections.
Each month through 2020, City of Newcastle’s 100% renewable contract performed better than a BAU projection with the exception of January and December.
Figure 02 – City of Newcastle 100% renewable electricity contract (Net ESA and VGA) compared with Business As Usual (BAU) projections.
The cumulative effect of this over the twelve-month period of 2020 results in a cost reduction of 12.15% against BAU, while achieving a supply of 100% renewable electricity. It is important to note that this analysis relates to the delivery of electricity rather than the associated emission reduction which comes from Large-scale Generation Certificates (LGCs). While purchasing 100% renewable electricity, City of Newcastle also sources enough LGCs through both self-generation and procurement to offset emissions and reach its 100% renewable electricity goal.
Figure 03 – Cumulative $ savings against BAU – 2020
Except for two particularly volatile days in January, which took until the end of February to recover against, the figure above emphasises that the rest of the year has shown steady cumulative savings from receiving cheaper electricity supply through the renewable energy contract.
Matching renewable generation against City of Newcastle electricity use
As renewable energy supply in the grid increases and we start to see oversupply, particularly in the middle of the day, matching this output with the electricity demand of customers will become more and more important. To achieve this, there needs to be a good understanding of an organisation’s electricity load profile. CN operates a wide range of buildings and facilities, including over 14,000 streetlights, so this detailed understanding of electricity use was a critical component of finding the right renewable generator to complement this load profile.
Figure 04 – Average daily load profile
The graph above shows that electricity usage for buildings and facilities predominately occurs during the day. Through an ongoing program at CN of installing solar PV across sites, this daytime demand has been greatly reduced over time. The biggest single area of electricity usage however is street lighting, providing a strong case for alternative renewable energy generation other than Solar power. The best match for providing this high evening generation turned out to be Sapphire Wind Farm.
Renewable Supply vs Demand 2020 performance
The renewable electricity contract has been sized to meet 100% of City of Newcastle (CN) electricity usage over the course of a year, including over 200 small sites. In application though, the generation is applied against load demand from large sites (C&I) and the Street lighting, with small sites (SME) treated separately for a number of reasons. Without going too much into detail, this structure also has the advantage of raising the supply/demand matching between the renewable generation and CN electricity usage.
Mapping the actual half-hourly City of Newcastle electricity usage from large sites and street lighting over the course of a year against the electricity purchase from Sapphire Wind Farm over the same period provides a number of interesting data points and considerations.
Figure 05 – City of Newcastle Electricity use matched to Renewable Electricity purchase
The graph above shows the output of the Sapphire Windfarm in blue (rated down to the % purchased by City of Newcastle) overlaid on the CN electricity use (in Orange) for large sites and street lighting for 2020. For all but a small period of the day between 6pm and 8pm, this average daily profile shows that there is enough renewable energy being produced to effectively power CN requirements and provide a hedge against spot market price volatility. With minimal battery storage, demand response or some energy efficiency works, the exposed load in the evening can be covered and therefore no longer exposed to potential high electricity spot-prices. This is already in train with the accelerated upgrade of street lighting to LED, significantly reducing night-time electricity use. A number of battery storage systems have also been installed at large sites with more on the way. This is part of City of Newcastle’s Climate Action Plan to firm renewable supply and build resilience across CN operations.
The graph above also shows excess supply from the Wind farm and this is because it has also been purchased to cover small site electricity usage (not shown above) and to provide future capacity for increased electricity usage from CN fleet including electric cars, electric trucks and heavy equipment.

Bringing it up a few levels to assess monthly performance over the course of the year, again shows strong results, with the windfarm supplying enough power in the aggregate to meet electricity consumption from CN operations every month of the year except June. For June, it just fell short of meeting total electricity demand by only 0.003%.
Figure 07 – Renewable Supply vs CN Electricity Demand, Monthly view
A Deeper dive
Looking closer at each of the 17,568 half-hourly periods in 2020 provides even further insight for those that like to get down in the weeds of energy data. It also gives some indication of the challenges in matching supply to demand in a future grid of much higher renewable energy penetration and as we move to a five-minute settlement market.
While much more could be written here, I’ll try and summarise in a short table:
This shows that for more than two-thirds of all CN electricity supply, the windfarm was generating enough power to match this on a half-hourly basis, without requiring any firming. It is also worth noting that this is when comparing a single source of renewable supply. By sourcing renewable electricity from a range of different generators, in different geographic areas, this matching can easily be much higher and reduces the need for large amounts of firming such as battery storage.
In fact, when we add in the excess renewable generation exported from City of Newcastle solar assets, the amount of matched electricity on a half-hourly basis rises to nearly three-quarters. In other words, only 26.54% of total electricity consumed over the year is during periods when there is no wind or solar being provided to CN from its Wind PPA or solar generation assets. This hybrid wind and solar supply is becoming increasingly popular for PPAs and identifies opportunity for a relatively small target to firm with battery storage or other options.
Where to now?
With the supply side of things locked in, there is now further work to be done in focusing on the demand side and reshaping our electricity load profile for maximum benefit. This includes street lighting upgrades as mentioned and other energy efficiency initiatives, as well as developing a demand response program. In tandem with this, the Climate Action Plan targets further increases in battery storage across sites to reduce peak electricity use and provide firming for renewables and to investigate opportunities in emerging technologies such as vehicle-to-grid (V2G).
As we begin to increase the number of electric vehicles in our fleet and transition our trucks and waste collection vehicles to electric options, we have also begun implementing smart charging capabilities to balance this additional demand. This includes using spot-market price signals to optimise our charging schedules. With the market moving to five-minute settlement from the current half-hourly intervals, having greater understanding of the data and the tools in place such as battery storage to flexibly and rapidly respond, will set CN up for even further electricity cost reductions as we work towards supporting a net zero emissions future.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/11/australias-world-leading-hydrogen-pipeline-drives-analysts-to-boost-renewable-growth-forecast/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 11, 2021",Australia’s world-leading hydrogen pipeline drives analysts to boost renewable growth forecast,"Major developments in Australia’s planned pipeline of green hydrogen projects coupled with some of the world’s most commercially viable energy storage facilities has caused Fitch Solutions to revise its expectations for Australia’s renewable energy transition. The market analysts now expect renewables to account for a considerably bigger share of the country’s energy generation, to the detriment of the thermal power sector.
Fitch Solutions
Australia’s green hydrogen project pipeline is nearing 30 GW, according to Fitch’s analysis. That is triple the size of the next biggest pipelines, which belong to Germany and the Netherlands at 10 GW.
“Australia currently leads the world with its robust green hydrogen pipeline, given strong policy support for the industry and significant investor interest. We believe that Australia has a high potential to scale up the development of green hydrogen and reach cost parity,” Fitch’s report reads.
“Significant growth in its renewables sector, whose prices have already fallen below that of fossil fuels, has made it a highly competitive and viable generation source in the market. This will have a mutually re-enhancing effect as it can also act as a form of energy storage for excess renewables generation, and become a capacity growth enabler.”
Fitch analysts share the renewable industry’s optimism about the prospect of Australia becoming a leading hydrogen exporter, noting this would unlock even more capacity for renewable sector growth.
Australian state governments, most notably the West Australian and Queensland governments, have both earmarked millions of dollars in funding to kick-start the green hydrogen industry. Industry has proven receptive, with a slate of project plans unveiled already this year.
Fitch Solutions
Labelling Australia “one of the few in the world where large-scale battery storage facilities have already grown commercially viable,” Fitch says the country’s energy storage solutions have offered respite from bottle-necked grids.
“The [large-scale energy storage] sector has continued to develop rapidly with record-breaking capacity values,” it said.
Pointing to CEP Energy’s plan to build an 1200 MW grid-scale battery storage project in the Hunter Economic Zone by 2023, Fitch says the completion of such world leading facilities will “support its renewables growth momentum and replace retiring thermal power stations.”
Taking into account the “stronger-than-expected” growth in Australia’s pipeline of energy storage and hydrogen projects, market analyst said it had made “several revisions” to its forecasts.
“We now forecast non-hydro renewables capacity to increase by an annual average rate of 5.5% between 2021 and 2030, totalling 47.4 GW by the end of the decade. This will see its share in the overall power mix increase notably from an estimated 18.6% in 2020 to 30.1% by 2030, with significant further upside risks.”
Fitch Solutions
The forecast growth for renewables led Fitch to downgrade its expectations for the thermal power industry, noting the acceleration of green energy integration poses a “structural risk” to the incumbent system.
“In addition to the planned retirement of older coal plants, thermal plants, especially coal, are becoming increasingly uncompetitive with cheaper renewables. The integration of renewable energy into the grid has lowered wholesale electricity prices significantly in recent quarters, making it increasingly difficult for baseload coal-fired power plants to remain economically feasible.
“This will be exacerbated by increased difficulty to source the required quality of coal due to a decline in coal mining production, which could lead to higher prices over the longer term. We believe that there is a high risk of early plant closures that could reduce capacity further than our original expectations.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/11/edify-chief-claims-future-is-bright-for-large-scale-solar-pv/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 11, 2021",Edify chief claims future is bright for large-scale solar PV,"The construction and commissioning of utility scale solar PV projects in Australia has slowed in recent years, giving rise to concerns that market and infrastructure constraints will hobble the nation’s transition to renewable energy but Edify Energy founder and chief executive, John Cole, is upbeat about the future.
Concerns about network capacity, rising capital expenditure costs and declining wholesale prices have been blamed for a reduction in the amount of large-scale PV entering the Australian transmission network but Cole has rejected any talk of doom and gloom, pointing to increasing opportunities as the sector continues to mature.
“I’m not a big fan of the doom and gloom,” he said on Thursday during the Clean Energy Council’s (CEC) Large-scale Solar Forum. “I think there are still lots of opportunity in the market.”
Cole highlighted EnergyAustralia’s announcement earlier this week that it would be closing the coal-fired Yallourn power station four years early as a glaring opportunity for the renewable energy sector.
Originally slated to close in 2032, the power station will now be retired by mid-2028. Yallourn currently supplies about 20% of Victoria’s electricity demand or 8% of the National Electricity Market (NEM).
“That’s 1,500 MW and one of the assets that’s replacing it is a 350 MW four-hour battery but we know batteries don’t produce any energy, they are not a generating machine so that’s a large gulf of energy that needs to be replaced,” Cole said.
“And we know we’re going to see other conventional power plants come offline faster than expected. There still is a lot of opportunity here.”

David Dixon, senior renewables analyst with independent energy research company Rystad, confirmed the amount of new utility scale PV coming online has slowed in recent years and remains subdued in 2021.
After surging in 2017 with the development of 19 large-scale PV assets of more than 20 MW totalling an estimated 1 GW, a record 2 GW of utility scale PV entered the grid in 2018 but since then it has dropped back to about 1 GW per year and Dixon said the sector continues to face considerable challenges.
“2017 was when it all kicked off,” he said. “At the time, conditions for investments were quite favourable. We had high wholesale prices in the market, above $80 a MWh in all states, LGC (large-scale generation certificate) prices were quite high and Marginal Loss Factors (MLF) were high in rural parts of the grid where you would want to connect utility PV assets.
“It was really in the second half of 2018 we saw these issues come to the forefront in regards to construction and connection.
“And that really flowed through into 2019 when all of a sudden we went from 2 GW to just 1 GW and the number of assets also halved. MLF essentially went through the floor for utility PV assets and we started to see constraints really start to bite.”
Widespread bushfires and the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic added to the concerns of investors and developers in 2020, sparking the exit of some key players from the Australian market and delivering a dramatic slowdown in construction and a reduction in the number of financial commitments.
Despite the hurdles, an estimated 1 GW of utility scale PV was developed in Australia in 2020 and the handing out of a string of power purchase agreements (PPAs) by government entities provided renewed security for the sector but Dixon said challenges remain.
“We moved into 2021 thinking perhaps this is going to be another record year of construction in the industry,” he said.
“There is certainly a lot in the pipeline in power purchase agreements to break ground but there is obviously a lot of headwind still in the market.”
Dixon said shipping rates had “gone through the roof”, triggering a “dramatic” rise in capital expenditure, commodity prices have gone up and the diminishing amount of network capacity to connect into “is universal across the grid”.
While there is no denying there has been a reduction in the number of financial commitments and network connections have dropped off since the start of 2019, Cole is not alone in his confidence for the sector.

Sam Reynolds, managing director of the Australian arm of renewable energy investment firm Octopus, which entered the Australian market with the 333 MW Darlington Point solar farm, believes the reduction in new large-scale PV is simply a market reset and a second wave is coming.
“What Australia had in the last two to three years is a massive lump of renewable energy generation coming on the longest grid in the world … and there’s no country in the world that could handle that,” he said. “It was the slowdown that kind of needed to happen.”
Reynolds said the industry had learnt a lot in recent years and with the Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) Integrated System Plan (ISP) calling for more than 26 GW of new large-scale solar and wind projects by 2040, it will be better for it moving forward.
“Only the best quality projects will get up which is good for the system,” he said.
“The best quality projects will get access to power purchase agreements which again is good.
“I think for us there is going to be a second run. Our plans are quite ambitious in Australian for the future.”

The deal will enable the construction of Lightsource BP’s West Wyalong solar farm, which will go on to provide renewable energy to its service stations.
While the West Wyalong solar farm has not yet reached financial close, Lightsource BP said in a statement released Tuesday that it had secured a contract with an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) company. It expects construction on the 280 hectare site to begin in the first half of 2021.
The power purchasing agreement (PPA) will see Snowy Hydro purchase two-thirds of the 238  GWh generated annually from West Wyalong solar farm for a 15 year period. Snowy Hydro, through its Red Energy retail arm, will then go on to provide 23 GWh of that green energy annually to BP’s service stations for 10 years, meeting the power requirements of all its service stations throughout NSW. The transition of all 88 petrol stations is expected to be complete by January 2023.
Lightsource BP’s country manager, Adam Pegg, said the company was able to finalise the PPA by leveraging its existing relationship with Snowy Hydro, which it has experience working with on a separate solar farm in Wellington.
Frédéric Baudry, president of BP Australia, said the move is in line with the oil giant’s target of net zero by 2050. In 2017, BP acquired part of the large-scale solar developer Lightsource, which was then rebranded to Lightsource BP. BP increased its stake in the company to 50/50 in 2019, with Lightsource BP becoming a major solar developer worldwide.
Last year, BP also began investigating the feasibility of a renewable hydrogen and ammonia production facility in Western Australia, awarded $1.7 million to do so from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/11/gladstone-to-host-500m-solar-to-hydrogen-plant/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,JAPAN,QUEENSLAND",BLAKE MATICH,"MARCH 11, 2021",Gladstone to host $500m solar to hydrogen plant,"London-based Eco Energy World (EEW) has announced plans for a AUD$500 million solar green hydrogen plant in Gladstone, Queensland (QLD). EEW, which is already developing a 300 MW solar project in Ragland, near the Port of Gladstone, is planning to combine the PV plant with a major green hydrogen project (project). 
Gladstone, a traditional coal and gas hub, is on its way to becoming a green hydrogen mecca with several ambitious projects already in the pipeline, including Hydrogen Utility’s proposed $1.61 billion industrial complex for the large-scale production of green hydrogen and ammonia. The H2-HubTM Gladstone facility will be built in stages to integrate up to 3 GW in electrolysis plant, and up to 5,000 tonnes per day ammonia production capacity.
Throw in Japanese trading giant Sumitomo’s plans, announced last month, to build a hydrogen production plant in Gladstone too, and the regional city which is already aiming to become the first Australian city to be on a blend of natural gas and hydrogen is well on its way to becoming one of the world’s major export hubs for green hydrogen too. 
The project 
EEW’s plan is to combine the 300 MW solar plant, which is currently at a ready to build stage, with a 200 MW hydrogen plant with a further 100 MW energy storage facility. EEW estimates the project will be able to produce 33,000 tonnes of green hydrogen annually. 

EEW’s Chairman Svante Kumlin said that the State of Queensland and Gladstone in particular “is well-positioned strategically to act as a major player in the future generation and export of hydrogen. This is due to its existing gas pipeline infrastructure, access to a deep-water export port at Gladstone and significant solar resources that make it an extremely attractive location for this emerging industry.” 
QLD has not been hiding its ambition to mirror Western Australia as the major east-coast green hydrogen exporter. Indeed, QLD sent its first trial shipment of green hydrogen to Japan almost two years ago to the day, and it became the first state to establish a ministry for hydrogen when Premier Palaszczuk announced her new cabinet after re-election in November 2020. 
By popular demand 
With great swathes of the world’s nations committing to net-zero emissions targets over the next two to three decades, except Australia, the urgent need of large-scale replacements is becoming exceedingly obvious. 
Energy hungry regions, particularly north-east Asia and Europe, lack the natural resources to generate large scale clean energy, particularly in Japan where nuclear energy has become politically, and literally, toxic. The answer, as Japan has very publicly committed to, is to transition to 100% green ammonia, and that is the demand the growing number of large-scale green hydrogen projects in Australia are looking to meet. Generate green hydrogen using solar and wind, convert it into ammonia for ease of transport, and ship it globally. 

As Sacha Thacker, Chief Strategy Officer of Intercontinental Energy, the project manager and major stakeholder in the 26 GW Asian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) in Western Australia’s Pilbara region, told pv magazine Australia, “the world needs solutions and the whole world needs them at the same time…So we are not at all worried about excess supply or lack of demand because the demand drivers are there. More and more countries are committing, Korea, Japan, China, the US has changed its stance. There is a lot of demand and not that many choices, and even fewer choices that can be produced at scale.”
