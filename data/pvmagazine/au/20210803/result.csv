Details about the system are still being determined, but a spokesperson for the Mildura Rural City Council told pv magazine Australia the system will have up to 99 kW of capacity.
Interestingly, half of all the savings stemming from the solar system, including those from modelled operational costs as well as profits from solar exports, will be provided to the local community group, Sunraysia Sustainability Network, for the next 10 years.
Mildura Rural City Council, which owns and will shortly operate the major sporting precinct, has had a long association with the group, which was described as a driving force for education around sustainability in the local community.
As part of the agreement, Sunraysia Sustainability Network will receive, in the form of a grant, 50% of the savings made by the system on the anniversary of its installation. This money, the group’s president Krister Jonsson said, will enable it to “continue raising awareness about sustainable living in our community through the Mildura Eco Village”.
The Mildura Eco Village is situated next to the Mildura Landfill and has been transformed by the network into a hub of environmental education and sustainable living for the community.
Councillor for Environment and Sustainability Jodi Reynold described the local council’s solar system plans as a win for the community.
“It will shave thousands of dollars from the precinct’s energy costs, it will further reduce our electricity demand from the grid, and best of all, it will help the hard-working members of the Sunraysia Sustainability Network continue their important work for the next 10 years.”
Construction of Stage 1 of the Mildura South Regional Sporting Precinct, which includes a stadium, sporting oval and stages, began in 2019 and is expected to be completed by mid-2021. Funding for Stage 2 of construction has been secured.

The other three projects will increase the capacity of existing lines on the transmission network to carry more cleanly generated electrons across Victoria and presumably ease curtailment issues.
The projects are intended to help enable the development of  renewable energy zones in Victoria’s west, south-west and north-west Murray River. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has been tasked with seeking the tenders for all six projects.
The Victorian government has allocated $540 million to fund the infrastructure for its renewable energy zones. “This is a clear signal to investors that Victoria is open for business, and ready for new wind and solar projects that create jobs and opportunities in local communities across Victoria,” the state’s Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change, Lily D’Ambrosio, said.
The government said it will also continue its assessment of the Western Victorian Transmission Network upgrades as well as upgrades in Mortlake – both of which have environmental approvals currently being undertaken.

LG Energy Solution, one of Australia’s most popular residential battery manufacturers, was already part of Discover Energy’s VPP platform, though today’s announcement seems to mark its progression to a more exclusive offering.
Humm Group, one of Australia’s largest ‘Buy Now Pay Later’ finance providers, is following a similar model in this foray. It claims customers who sign up for its VPP program will receive an “energy credit” matched to the monthly instalment to Humm, effectively offsetting the cost of the system.
To be eligible for the VPP, customers need to purchase and install solar and an LG Energy Solution VPP battery and finance the purchase through Humm – which is expected to carry a price tag of around $17,200.
Nonetheless, LG Energy Solution’s General Manager of Residential Sales, Philip Crotty, says it is aiming to create the “largest residential VPP network in Australia.”
The VPP will be rollout initially in Victoria, before being made available to other eastern states.
LG Energy Solutions
LG Energy Solution and Humm Group expect solar and battery adoption in Australia to more than double to become a $5 billion market by 2025, up from $2.2 billion this year. This growth, it says, will be powered by Virtual Power Plants. Using software, VPPs essentially aggregate the capacity of the residential batteries in their networks. By combining the storage capacities, VPPs are able to trade on Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) markets which can be lucrative. This is expected to decrease the buyback time of home batteries – which remain a prohibitively costly solution for most households.

VPPs have also piqued the interest of Australian state governments, many of which have trials or pilot programs underway. This is because through aggregation, residential batteries are able to provide more grid stabilisation, potentially smoothing out the notorious duck curve caused by the influx of solar energy into the grid around midday.
LG and Humm say they want to have 10,000 VPP-linked energy storage systems installed by end of financial year in 2023.
Alongside Australia’s residential solar boom, the number of companies offering to finance renewable energy solutions has grown.
Humm Group says it has financed over $2.2 billion of rooftop solar in Australia, helping deliver 1 GW of clean energy into the grid. “VPP is a natural progression for us with 265,000 solar systems financed since 2010. This new channel advances humm’s leadership position by adding to our existing in home sales and corporate energy finance channels as green energy continues to evolve,” Humm Group CEO Rebecca James said.
Discover Energy
Earlier this year, LG Energy Solution issued a recall notice for some of its battery energy storage systems (ESS) due to potential defects which can cause overheating and fire, following issues in the United States.
This recall included earlier models of the home battery to be used in the VPP – that is, its Residential Energy Storage Unit (RESU). The model range has been on market since 2016, with the recall affecting batteries manufactured between March 2017 and September 2018

Back in June, the Senate blocked Energy Minister Angus Taylor’s attempt to illegally expand the mandate of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) to fund non-renewable projects after Labor, the Greens, and the cross-bench combined to shut the move down. Last week, Taylor unequivocally demonstrated that he doesn’t understand the word ‘no’, and certainly not an unequivocal ‘no’. 
Last Friday, the Morrison government made a renewed attempt at shifting the remit of ARENA to include fossil-fuel related technologies including carbon capture and storage (CCS) and hydrogen generated by fossil-fuels. 
“From today,” said Taylor in a statement, “new regulations take effect that broaden ARENA’s mandate to enable the agency to play an important role in stimulating investment that will help achieve the Technology Investment Roadmap stretch goals as well as energy efficiency measures.” 
In the statement, Taylor continued to roll out his “technology not taxes” false-dichotomy and insisted that the only way to reduce emissions without Australian households bearing the load is to prop up fossil fuels with funding for renewables, even though renewables like solar are already cheaper. 
In an interview with 2GB radio last week, Taylor, who has clearly never read to the end of Hamlet or learned his government’s lesson about the consequences of indecision when it comes to Covid-19 vaccinations, said “You know, ruling things out is the wrong thing to do in the energy debate or any of these sorts of debates. As soon as you start ruling things out, you make life harder for everybody.” 
We have again and again defeated Angus Taylor’s attempts to axe or gut the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and we’ll do it again if we need to.
And if Angus Taylor wants to take this appalling idea to an election, we’ll happily campaign to save renewables. https://t.co/JlAN6SDVxo

Parliament is set to sit today, and according to 7 News Labor is going to put forward another disallowance motion. This time however, the ‘no’ is not going to be as unequivocal as last time, with the motion set to be focus specifically on CCS and fossil fuel generated hydrogen, rather than the entire expansion. 
Labor climate spokesman Chris Bowen once again came out in opposition against the latest attempt to gut ARENA, saying the government’s regulations were contrary to the entire project of ARENA, to “improve the competitiveness of renewable energy technologies and increase the supply of renewable energy in Australia.” 
“Experts say that funding other technologies would be inconsistent with the object of the Act, and would likely be subject to legal challenge. 
Greens leader Adam Bandt wants nothing short of a full dismissal of the re-proposed regulations, saying “Angus Taylor’s crusade to spend more public dollars on coal and gas is as shambolic as it is reckless.”  
Last time the Senate was able to block Taylor’s egregious motion because One Nation leader Pauline Hanson failed to show up for the vote. It is not clear whether Australia will be so lucky today.

The first heterojunction Smartwire solar modules have just come off Meyer Burger’s production line in Germany’s Saxony, and the Swiss company is already planning its next step.
It announced Thursday that it plans to add innovative solar PV roof tiles to its portfolio. The product will be a roof-integrated, high-performance PV system that can be installed like traditional roof tiles.
To accelerate the market launch, Meyer Burger has acquired a highly developed solution from an unnamed German engineering service provider that has already been certified and approved by the German building authorities, in accordance with IEC 61215 and IEC 61730.
The purchase agreement includes all intellectual property rights to the PV roof tile solution, including all associated patents, certifications, and building authority approval, as well as technical knowhow, said Meyer Burger. The parties agreed not to disclose the purchase price.
The roof-integrated solar PV system will expand Meyer Burger’s portfolio in the premium rooftop segment. The manufacturer plans to present its solar roof at Intersolar Europe in Munich at the beginning of October.
Meanwhile, first deliveries of the PV tiles to customers are scheduled for the second half of 2022, according to the company. They will be designed in such a way that they can be easily installed and maintained by a roofer, it added.
“Integrated solar roof systems still represent a market niche today,” said Gunter Erfurt, CEO of Meyer Burger. “With our novel solar tile solution, we plan to take roof-integrated solutions out of the niche and into a larger market.”
Moreover, expanding the portfolio in this direction is a “consistent step within our growth strategy,” Erfurt added. With the integrated roof system, it will also be possible, in the future, to develop roof areas that are not suitable for the installation of standard PV modules.
The company added that it also intends to rely on its heterojunction smartwire technology for the tiles.
To date, Meyer Burger’s most prominent competitor in the PV tile market is probably Tesla. The CEO of the Californian electric car manufacturer, Elon Musk, presented his vision of a solar tile for the “solar roof” back in the autumn of 2016.
Since then, he has remained rather quiet again about the solution and it is relatively unclear how many roofs are equipped with Tesla’s PV tiles. There are also several other suppliers on the market, such as Autarq, Sunroof, and Midsummer.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/03/anu-researchers-go-round-the-twist-with-latest-ultra-thin-solar-discovery/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY",BLAKE MATICH,"AUGUST 3, 2021",ANU researchers go round the twist with latest ultra-thin solar discovery,"Scientists at The Australian National University (ANU), which received $3.6 million in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) in January as part of the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics Infrastructure project, have discovered something interesting about the potential of ultra-thin 2D materials. 
Back in 2019, Hieu Nguyen and PhD candidate Mike Tebyetekerwa demonstrated the maximum potential of ultra-thin 2D materials to generate electricity using sunlight for the first time. This is to say, materials thin as a single atom capable of harvesting solar energy, a technology that could revolutionise the solar industry as well as many other industries besides. 
Last week, the two ANU scientists published a study in “Cell Reports Physical Science” in which they demonstrate a curious and exciting observation – that the ability of these ultra-thin materials to convert sunlight into electricity can be controlled by “twisting” the angle between two layers of the material. 

By themselves, a monolayer of the material can’t do much, they have to be paired in what is called “heterobilayers” in such a way that the “close interlayer spacing…of their similar hexagonal crystal symmetry” means they can be tuned with a”wide degree of freedom”.
Tebyetekerwa, the lead author of the paper, said this discovery of “tuneable twistronics” opens up exciting opportunities. 

“This study essentially provides a bit of a how-to guide for engineers,” Tebyetekerwa said. “We’re looking at 2D materials that have just two atom-thin layers stacked together. This unique structure and large surface area make them efficient at transferring and converting energy.”
The potential of this technology is virtually limitless, and certainly not limited to solar cells, but also mobile phones, sensing devices etc. The materials, which are hundreds of thousands times thinner than a human hair, so thin they make Kate Moss look like Jabba the Hutt, could be coated on all types of surfaces, from phone screens to car windshields, enabling the device to power itself. 

“It’s an exciting new field,” said Nguyen, “simply twisting the two ultra-thin layers can dramatically change the way they work. The key is to carefully select the matching pair and stack them in a particular way.” 
There is still a lot of research to do on this ultra-thin, ultra-lightweight, transparent materials capable of holding high-voltage solar cells, but these researchers are proving that you don’t have to go completely round the twist to make great innovations, just a little twist is enough.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/03/a-closer-look-at-liquid-air-energy-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,UNITED KINGDOM,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 3, 2021",A closer look at liquid air energy storage,"From pv magazine Global
A group of scientists from the University of Birmingham, in the United Kingdom, and the University of Melbourne, in Australia, has investigated, in an extensive research, the potential of liquid air energy storage (LAES), which has so far seen development for large scale energy storage, and it has been mostly developed by U.K.-based specialist Highview Power.
The company is currently preparing to deploy LAES technology in a range of locations including a 400 MWh system in the United States, a 250 MWh project in the United Kingdom, and a 300 MWh facility in Spain. “LAES has, currently, a technology readiness level (TRL) of 8,” research co-author Adriano Sciacovelli told pv magazine. The TRL measures the maturity of technology components for a system and is based on a scale from one to nine, with nine representing mature technologies for full commercial application.
The technology is described by the research group as a concept where electricity is stored in the form of liquid air or nitrogen at cryogenic temperatures – below -150 degrees Celsius. It charges by using excess electricity to power compression and liquefaction of the air which is then stored as a liquid at temperatures approaching -196 degrees Celsius. To discharge, the liquid air warms and becomes a pressurised gas that operates a turbine to generate electricity.
It was conceived for utility scale applications and an output ranging from 5 MW to 100 MW. “Compared to pumped-hydro storage, which is based on the same basic concept, cryogenic energy storage has the advantage that it is a technology that can be produced through an established industry and without any expensive or rare material,” emphasised Sciacovelli. “Furthermore, there are no degradation issues and no need for specific locations or the orographic conditions that are needed for pumped-hydro, or of an underground cavity, as for compressed air storage.” Compared to these storage technologies, however, LAES has the drawback of a lower cycle efficiency, for both charging and discharging, which is close to 60%. Nonetheless, cycle efficiency can be increased through integration and co-location of LAES with nearby processes, for example liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals.
An LAES system produces hot and cold streams during its operation, both during air compression for charging and evaporation for discharging, and these streams can be utilised to improve the system efficiency, or in several industrial process. “Currently, all existing projects are being developed for grid support but decarbonisation targets will likely push this technology closer to industrial processes that waste a lot of heat,” Sciacovelli stated.
The ideal location of cryogenic storage is at a grid node with a high share of renewables or an industrial park with large waste of heat. “Cryogenic storage is not directly competing with lithium-ion batteries as it provides storage for a longer duration, from over 10 hours,” Sciacovelli added. “By contrast, for lithium-ion storage, when it is needed for more than between four and six hours, bankability, currently, remains an issue.”
In terms of costs, the research group estimated that an LAES system can be built at between €300 and €600 (AU$480 – $960) per megawatt-hour. “Investment return is estimated at approximately 20 years for a standalone system without integration with an industrial facility for use of excess heat,” research co-author Andrea Vecchi told pv magazine. “An ideal location in an industrial park, however, may significantly reduce this time frame.”
All existing projects were defined by the research team as bankable, although they stressed that these positive business cases are favoured by certain conditions, including a determined price structure in the energy market and the presence of a grid unable to support high levels of renewable energy penetration. “LAES systems are, so far, conceived as strategic assets for the power network,” Vecchi further explained. “They can provide not only grid balancing but several grid services.”
Furthermore, the scientist went on to say, due to the high energy density of liquid air, cryogenic storage occupies less space than compressed air or pumped hydro. “We estimate that these systems can be smaller by at least an order of magnitude,” he stated.
More details on the research can be found in the paper Liquid air energy storage (LAES): a review on technology state-of-the-art, integration pathways and future perspectives, published in Advances in Applied Energy.
