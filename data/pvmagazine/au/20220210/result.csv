The amended schedule comes as AGL reiterated its plan to split into two listed entities – energy retailer AGL Australia and electricity generator Accel Energy – by June 30.
AGL managing director and CEO Graeme Hunt said the plan to accelerate the closure dates of its fossil-fuel fired generation portfolio was a response to Australia’s accelerating energy transition.
“There is no doubt that coal-fired generation across the entire system will exit earlier than previously believed,” he said.
“Energy transition and the path to net zero will be the defining challenge of our era. Companies that don’t adapt, don’t innovate, and don’t set themselves on this path will be left behind.”
AGL said its black coal-fired Bayswater power station in the NSW Hunter Valley will be shuttered “no later than” 2033, two years ahead of its previously scheduled closure of 2035, while its brown coal-fired Loy Yang A plant in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley will now close by 2045 rather than 2048.
AGL’s coal-fired Liddell power plant, also in the Hunter, remains on track to close in April 2023, while the final unit at the gas-burning Torrens Island power station near Adelaide in South Australia is scheduled to close in September.

Hunt said the fast-tracked plant closures amount to “a significant contribution to Australia’s energy sectors’ decarbonisation process, with the possibility of improvement beyond this if Accel Energy is able to bring closure dates further forward within the closure ranges”.
AGL modelling shows an expected 90 million tonnes reduction in emissions between 2023 and 2050 compared to previously modelled scenarios, but Greenpeace Australia dismissed the amended closure schedule as a “token effort”.
“AGL doesn’t even get a golf clap for its timid token effort in delaying the closure timeline for Loy Yang A, Australia’s worst-polluting coal-burning power station, to 2045,” said Glenn Walker, a senior campaigner at Greenpeace Australia Pacific.
“In delaying Loy Yang A and Bayswater’s inevitable closure, AGL is putting worker and investor security, as well as the climate, at serious risk.
“Loy Yang A and its attached brown coal mine pump out over 20 million tonnes of climate pollution every year. Keeping this brown-coal blight on our climate open until 2045 will produce a further 460 million tonnes of toxic emissions, equivalent to the [annual] pollution from over 100 million cars, putting Australia’s chance at a safer climate future in jeopardy.”
Federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor warned the earlier closure times will “leave a considerable gap of close to 5,000 MW of reliable generation in the National Electricity Market (NEM)”.
“While this announcement is a commercial decision and AGL has complied with the minimum 3.5-year notice period, the exit of such a considerable amount of reliable generation is a concern for the continued reliability and affordability of the system,” he said.
“Delivery of new, timely, replacement dispatchable capacity will be critical in keeping prices low and the lights on.”
AGL has already moved to replace its fossil fuel assets, previously announcing plans to develop 850 MW of new large-scale battery storage by the end of 2024, while last year it acquired two C&I solar businesses to become Australia’s largest commercial solar provider.
AGL announced on Thursday it had posted an after-tax profit of $194 million for the first half of the 2022 financial year, down 41% on the same time a year ago. Revenue rose 5% to $5.713bn.

Plans for the renewable energy hub, to be built approximately 120 kilometres south of the coastal town of Onslow and 170km west of the Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) operated Eliwana mine site, have this week been released for public comment by the WA Environmental Protection Authority.
The proposal is to construct and operate a renewable energy hub comprising an enormous 3.33 GW solar farm and a 2.04 GW wind farm spread across approximately 10,000 hectares. The hub would also include a battery with a storage capacity of 9.1 GWh.
A 220 kV transmission line would connect the Uaroo Hub main substation to a substation at the Eliwana mining operations. The transmission line has not been included in the EPA submission.
FMG said the Uaroo Renewable Energy Hub will provide renewable energy to power its mining operations in the Pilbara and is a critical component of it achieving net zero emissions from its mining operations by 2030.

The miner said the renewable electricity would eventually eliminate its reliance on gas and diesel-fired generation and diesel-fuelled mobile plant such as haul trucks and trains which currently consume hundreds of millions of litres of fuel annually.
It is expected the Uaroo project would reduce the miner’s current annual carbon emissions of 2.2 million tonnes by at least 1.5 million tonnes by the end of this decade.
“The proposal is an essential step toward FMG’s larger goal of supporting the rapid uptake of zero-carbon fuels globally,” the company said in its submission to the EPA.
FMG said it had has previously considered alternative energy sources to power its Pilbara mining operations but said the Uaroo Renewable Energy Hub is a “compelling option” and hoped the project would inspire others to implement similar solutions, as they too target net-zero operations.
“Renewable energy is now, in many cases, the lowest-cost form of energy available, making its uptake a contributor to financial performance as well as climate health,” the company said.
“The proposal will demonstrate the viability of zero-carbon technologies in fuelling commercial-scale operations and will encourage other proponents to follow suit.”

FMG said the project had been scaled to provide a reliable power supply source to satisfy the miner’s operational needs with consideration given to the variability of wind speed and the restriction of solar power generation to daylight hours.
The renewable generation assets will be integrated with the company’s $700 million Pilbara Energy Connect program, which includes a $250 million transmission project that will install 275km of high voltage transmission lines connecting Fortescue’s mining operations in the region.
Two of those mine sites, the Christmas Creek and Cloudbreak mining operations, are already partially powered by solar energy following the completion of the 60 MW Chichester Hub Solar Farm.
FMG said construction of the Uaroo Renewable Energy Hub will commence following receipt of all necessary approvals. The renewable energy generation and electricity transmission infrastructure will be constructed and commissioned in stages with works anticipated to run for approximately seven years.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/10/u-s-president-provides-backing-for-brisbane-based-ev-charging-company/,"EV,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 10, 2022",U.S. President provides backing for Brisbane-based EV charging company,"U.S. President Joe Biden hosted Tritium chief executive officer Jane Hunter in a press conference at the White House this week to celebrate the Brisbane-based electric vehicle (EV) charging company’s announcement that it would establish a large-scale manufacturing facility in Lebanon, Tennessee.
The new manufacturing facility is expected to house up to six production lines, employ more than 500 people over the next five years and produce more than 10,000 DC fast charger units per year, with the potential to produce approximately 30,000 units per year at peak capacity.
Tritium said production is expected to start at the Tennessee facility sometime in the third quarter of 2022.
Biden, who recently announced $7.5 billion ($AU10.45bn) to build out a national network of 500,000 EV chargers along highway corridors in the U.S, said Tritium’s decision to establish a factory in Tennessee ties in with his vision for “electrifying” transportation.
“When we wrote, and passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we included $7.5 billion for electric vehicle chargers, like the one Jane brought along today,” he said.
“And later this week, we’re going to announce a state-by-state allocation for $5 billion of the funding for these chargers so states can start making plans to build out what will become a national network of electric vehicle chargers.
“Tritium’s new facility is going to produce up to 30,000 of these chargers every year. And they’ll be installed up and down the highways and corridors in our communities all across the country.”

Hunter, who last month oversaw Tritium’s Nasdaq listing, said the company’s U.S. expansion is part of a global trend to provide fast EV charging solutions to the “masses”.
“Tritium’s investment in a U.S.-based, cutting-edge facility for manufacturing is part of our strong push toward global growth in support of the e-mobility industry,” she said.
“We are thrilled to work with the U.S. Federal Government and the state of Tennessee on this initiative. With the help of the hard-working residents of Tennessee, we expect to double or even triple our charger production capacity to further our product distribution throughout the United States.”
The company is also expected to announce the expansion of its European manufacturing capacity, through expansion of existing facilities or establishment of new facilities, in 2023.
Founded in Brisbane in 2001 by David Finn, James Kennedy and Paul Sernia, Tritium launched its first DC fast charger in 2014. Since then it has become a leading global supplier of EV refuelling infrastructure, with a sales and support footprint in 41 countries across four continents, and an extensive list of customers including Shell, BP, BMW and Ionity which has the largest fast-charging DC network across Europe.
Preliminary revenue figures provided by Tritium show that for the 12 months up to December 31, 2021, the U.S. and European markets each accounted for approximately 43% of the company’s revenue, compared to approximately 23% and 68%, respectively, for the 12 months ended June 30, 2021.
Despite the growth of its global markets, Hunter has previously said the company will continue to “build out of Brisbane to service the Asia-Pacific region”.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/10/grazing-animals-increase-carbon-sequestration-by-up-to-80-in-pv-projects/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"FEBRUARY 10, 2022",Grazing animals increase carbon sequestration by up to 80% in PV projects,"From pv magazine USA
In a recent presentation, titled “Managed Sheep Grazing Can Improve Soil Quality and Carbon Sequestration at Solar Photovoltaic Sites,” researchers from Temple University investigated the effects of periodic sheep grazing on soil properties. Micro and macro nutrients, carbon storage, and soil grain size distribution at six commercial solar PV sites were compared to undisturbed control sites.
The research describes the relationship between levels of shading and the biomass production of various plants, shown in the chart below. The analysis found that the “meaningful forage productivity” of most of their chosen ruminant appropriate species significantly increased under 45% shade, while most plants under 80% shade saw a marked decrease in biomass volume.

The results align with prior research from the University of Oregon, which found that solar panels altered the microclimate variables of mean air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and soil moisture. This improved water efficiency, allowing for much greater biomass growth, drove a 90% increase in grasses for sheep and cows.
The extensive list of plants examined is a definite positive, as the rate of installation for ground-mount solar power accelerates. Efforts are currently being made by the US Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture and University of Illinois to determine which row crops, foraging crops, and specialty crops are best to couple with solar panels in agrivoltaic settings.
In this project’s case, land at the facility has been managed by the Minnesota Native Landscapes’ Conservation Grazing Program. Their approach to regenerative land management relies on the planned impact of livestock grazing. This approach gives holistic consideration to the type of soil and plants, as well as the animals which will be grazing, with an eye towards rehabilitating the soil over time. The group works with sheep, bison, cattle, and goats in their land conservation programs.
Across the six sites, researchers allowed 500-700 sheep to graze the sites two to three times per year.
The researchers’ early estimates suggest that an acre of grazed native plants may improve soil at a rate of one ton of sequestered carbon per year, and that carbon and other nutrients may accumulate for 12 to 15 years before the soil is fully saturated.
The total exchange capacity of the soil (a soil fertility measurement based on how many cations can be retained on soil surfaces) showed a marked improvement at four of the six sites, and an overall increase in the estimated nitrogen release, ammonia, and nitrate was found at all but one of the sites. A similar increase was seen in other nutrients as well, including Mg, Na, K, P, Ca, and S.
This data points in the same direction as an analysis of Upper Midwest solar power facilities integrating natural prairie grasses, which sequester roughly half a ton of carbon per acre without livestock. That study demonstrated a 65% greater carbon retention compared to a purely agricultural scenario, and 35% improvement over a solar-turfgrass scenario.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/10/doped-carbon-for-a-reliable-lithium-sulfur-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SOUTH KOREA",MARK HUTCHINS,"FEBRUARY 10, 2022",Doped carbon for a reliable lithium sulfur battery,"From pv magazine Global
There is no shortage of materials promising to kick off “the next generation” in energy storage. Among these, lithium-sulfur batteries have proved popular among researchers and commercial developers, with the potential for higher capacity than today’s energy storage technology, while replacing some of the rare, valuable materials used in batteries with cheap, abundant sulfur.
Lithium-sulfur batteries, however, tend to be limited by a side effect known as polysulfide shuttling, which leads to sulfur leaking from the cathode as the battery cycles, rapidly reducing its performance. Different solutions have been suggested for this, many involving the use of conductive nanomaterials to mitigate the shuttling effect.
Scientists led by Pusan National University in South Korea developed one such material, beginning with methylene blue – a common organic salt used in textile dyeing and various other applications. The group dissolved methylene blue into a solvent, and used heat and plasma to produce a porous carbon material, doped with both nitrogen and sulfur. This material was then applied to the separator film placed between the cathode and anode a lithium-sulfur battery. The fabrication and application of the coating are described in full in the paper Plasma-engineered organic dyes as efficient polysulfide-mediating layers for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries, published in Chemical Engineering Journal.
Batteries manufactured with the coating achieved a specific capacity of 1,329 milliamp hours per gram (mAh g−1) and retained specific capacity of 669 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.3 degrees Celsius. While the battery would need to retain a much higher portion of its capacity after 100 cycles to catch the eye of commercial battery developers, the results serve as proof of concept for the approach, and should inspire further research. “This work highlights the potential application of this heteroatom-doped carbon material in Li-S batteries, as well as the viability of dye compound-derived carbon materials in energy storage devices,” the group noted.
Beyond lithium-sulfur, the group speculates that its approach could be useful in other energy storage technologies, and that other organic dye substances may also be worth investigating for similar applications. “Our findings show that methylene blue, and possibly other dyes, can be useful in next-generation energy storage systems,” said Seung Geol Lee, Professor of Organic Material Science & Engineering at Pusan National University. “We expect our results to greatly contribute to the manufacturing of not only lithium-sulfur batteries but also various other energy storage systems such as sodium-ion batteries, in which carbon materials can be used.”
