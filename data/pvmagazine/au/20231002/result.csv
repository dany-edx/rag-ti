Dragonfly Energy has manufactured a lithium-based battery cell using high-purity lithium hydroxide that was recovered from recycled batteries. The proof of concept could help to build a more sustainable, circular battery manufacturing industry, it said.
The lithium hydroxide was recovered by Aqua Metals, which is working on recycling solutions for materials used in energy storage and electric vehicle supply chains. The two companies are working on creating a closed lithium loop – where lithium batteries are sourced, manufactured and recycled – all in Nevada.
Using recycled lithium addresses two major initiatives for Dragonfly Energy, said CEO Denis Phares.
“It helps close the loop by filling in that all-important recycling component, and it provides a ready and sustainable supply of lithium for use in upcoming cell production,” he explained.
The Reno, Nevada-based Aqua Metals pulled the lithium hydroxide from “black mass” – a term that refers to a mixture of crushed and shredded battery cells that have already been used, which contains lithium and one valuable raw materials. Dragonfly Energy used this lithium hydroxide to produce a battery cell with a patented dry powder coating process.
The companies are eyeing the potential of building a closed lithium loop in Nevada, a state they believe is well-positioned to be “the starting and ending point for lithium batteries.” Nevada is believed to have the largest source of lithium in North America, according to the companies, and is also an expanding market for electric vehicles and energy storage technology applications.
Recycling is essential to creating a robust and sustainable energy storage industry in the U.S. and ensuring the country remains globally competitive in the clean energy sector, Aqua Metals’ Cotton told pv magazine USA.
“Recycling lithium ion batteries is the most immediate route to developing domestic supplies of critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and nickel, which are facing increasing supply shortages as the world ramps up clean energy manufacturing,” said Cotton.
The biggest challenge to closing the lithium loop in Nevada as well as other parts of the country will be timing, Cotton said. It is expected that the United States will have nearly a terawatt-hour of lithium battery manufacturing operational by 2030, enough for 12 million to 13 million electric vehicles a year, he said.
“What we won’t have by then is the mines, mineral processing, and refinement capacity to satisfy the raw resource demand,” Cotton said.
Mines can take seven to 10 years to come online and begin producing battery-grade materials, while recycling facilities – which can be operationalised in six months – are constrained by the availability of recyclable materials, he added.
“Making the timing work out for resource demand, manufacturing, and our decarbonisation ambitions will be a significant challenge as we create the closed loop systems necessary for a robust electrified economy,” said Cotton.

The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies says that the industry needs to focus on hydrogen storage due to limited investments and an uncertain profit model. They suggest large-scale storage in proven salt caverns, primarily in Poland, Germany, and the United Kingdom, with less potential in southern Europe. Underground storage of compressed hydrogen in lined rock caverns and depleted hydrocarbon fields is being explored, with contamination concerns requiring further study. Smaller-scale storage options like above-ground tanks, liquid hydrogen, and ammonia may also be viable depending on specific situations.
US and Singaporean researchers have introduced a low-cost aluminium formate (ALF) capable of storing significant hydrogen quantities at non-cryogenic temperatures (>120 K) and low pressures. ALF, with a binding energy of 8.6 kJ/mol, requires cooling to approximately -100 C for maximum hydrogen storage. This molecular sponge, composed of inexpensive aluminum and organic compounds, shows promise for mass-market applications, potentially serving as fuel storage for industrial backup power. ALF is priced at USD 2/kg ($3.11/kg), one-fifth of the community goal for nickel-based MOF production costs, making it an attractive option for safe hydrogen storage systems supporting fuel cells
Nikola has introduced its hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle at its manufacturing site in Coolidge, Arizona. The American heavy-duty vehicle manufacturer reported 223 non-binding orders from 23 customers and highlighted the truck’s impressive attributes: a 500-mile range and a quick 20-minute fuelling time.
New York State Governor Kathy Hochul has unveiled a USD 100 million funding initiative for zero-emission school buses statewide. This initiative marks the first round of funding under the USD 4.2 billion Clean Water, Clean Air, and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act of 2022. Starting on Nov. 29, manufacturers and dealers of zero-emission battery electric (BEV) or hydrogen fuel cell electric buses can apply to receive funding.
Salzgitter has chosen Andritz to construct a 100 MW electrolysis plant at its Salzgitter Flachstahl site on an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) basis. The plant will incorporate pressurised alkaline electrolyser technology from HydrogenPro. Expected to commence operation in 2026, this facility will produce approximately 9,000 tons of green hydrogen annually, which will be utilized in the production of green steel, as stated by the German steel manufacturer.
The International Energy Agency says that rapid progress has been observed in commercial-scale demonstrations of solid oxide hydrogen electrolysers, with two large demonstrators commencing operations in 2023. However, according to the latest update to its Roadmap: A Global Pathway to Keep the 1.5 C Goal in Reach, electrolysers are still falling behind. This assessment holds true even when considering preliminary manufacturing projects, indicating a gap in achieving the targets for 2030 in a Net Zero Scenario.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says that the Just Transition Fund is investing €1.6 billion in Czechia to establish new hydrogen valleys in regions currently dependent on coal. She emphasises that their investments span the entire clean hydrogen value chain, covering production, storage, transport, and industrial applications. Additionally, von der Leyen highlights that Czech Tatra Trucks will unveil the first hydrogen-powered heavy-duty vehicle in November.
The European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will go into effect during its transitional phase on Oct. 1. During this stage, CBAM will exclusively cover imports of cement, iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity, and hydrogen, according to the European Commission. This phase aims to enable EU institutions to gather data on embedded emissions and improve the methodology for the definitive application period, commencing in 2026.

Residents of Utrecht, the Netherlands, will have the opportunity to use shared cars as stationary batteries to store renewable energy when vehicles are not in use. Dutch companies We Drive Solar and MyWheels have said that the project will establish Utrecht as the world’s first city to provide bidirectional energy services using electric vehicles.
The companies expect to connect 300 electric shared cars in the city to bidirectional charging stations by the end of this year. These vehicles will be able to charge from the stations and also discharge energy, in order to serve as a neighbourhood energy storage facility.
“The available solar and wind energy is used to charge the shared cars and can be fed back at times when there is a higher demand for sustainable electricity,” the two companies said in a statement. “Shared cars as neighbourhood batteries on wheels can play an important role in countering grid congestion and thereby accelerating the energy transition.”
The station will features 25 Ioniq 5, a V2G technology developed by South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor. V2G technology is used to feed the energy stored in EV batteries back into national grids, which can help to stabilize power supplies during high-demand periods. However, in order for this technology to have a sufficient impact on grid operations, large-scale deployment is necessary.
