According to the report, released by Geosciences Australia, the country provided 49% of the global supply of lithium, essential for battery storage technologies and electric vehicles. It was also a top five producer of cobalt, ilmenite, manganese, rare earths and zircon, all of which are considered essential minerals for advanced and renewable technologies. Rare earths, for instance, being used in permanent magnets which are vital to both wind turbines and electric vehicles.

The report found in the year to December 2020, Australia’s economic inventories increased for rare earths (up 4%), lithium (up 8%), vanadium (up 23%) and platinum group elements, which increased an impressive 185%.
“We’re seeing demand for these minerals grow, particularly as the world transitions to low-emissions technologies,” Geoscience Australia’s Director of Mineral Resources Advice and Promotion, Allison Britt, said.
The report also noted that in 2020, mineral exports were valued at $231 billion and investment in mineral exploration reached $2.8 billion, an increase of 6% compared to the previous year. This is the highest spend on exploration since 2012.

The increase, which is notably before some of the major supply shortages came into play last year, nonetheless marks Australia’s push in terms of both investment and rhetoric towards becoming a serious critical mineral supply alternative to China, which currently dominates the global role. Compared to Australia, China also exports refined and processed products rather than simply raw materials – a part of the supply chain Australia’s government and various companies are vying to change.
In March, the federal government allocated $240 million for critical minerals supplies. To a similar end, it also granted Western Australian miner Iluka Resources a $1.25 billion loan to build Australia’s first integrated rare earths refinery to supply electric vehicle and renewable energy industries earlier this month. 
Private companies are also looking to expand Australia’s share, with Australian Vanadium Limited last week announcing that its plans for a vanadium mine and eventually vanadium electrolyte processing plant were found to be “bankable” and construction could begin as early as next year. 

The markets for critical minerals have already expanded significantly in the last years and are set to grow far, far more before 2050.
“The International Energy Agency forecasts nickel and lithium use in batteries will increase sixfold and thirteenfold, respectively, by 2040. There is an urgency to discover new world-class resources to meet this projected demand and further develop the pipeline of mineral resources that will anchor secure supply chains for Australia and our partners,” Britt said.

The agreement is set to commence in 2025 and is part of Germany’s push to move itself off a dependance on Russian gas. The agreement includes the supply of a minimum of 240 GWh per year to a maximum of 350 GWh per year and is set to supply households in Mannheim, south of Frankfurt, Germany. 
The Rhine Valley project involves Vulcan drilling several deep wells into an underground brine reservoir – essentially hot, salty water – outside Mannheim then pumping it to the surface where its heat will be transferred “via heating grids and a series of underground pipes that deliver hot water or steam to buildings in the local community.”
Eventually, Vulcan plans to extract lithium using this same geothermal wells using a method it claims has among the lowest footprints for lithium extraction. 

Exactly what that process involves is a bit opaque, but the company’s website says: “through wells into the deep sub-surface, hot, lithium-rich brine from our project area is pumped to the surface… the spent brine then gets re-injected in a closed-loop cycle.”
Vulcan says the method “incur[s] virtually zero disruption to communities or the environment.”
“We believe that geothermal renewable energy on a mass scale, combined with lithium extraction from the same deep geothermal source, can and will play an important part in achieving Europe and Germany’s energy security and independence,” Vulcan’s Managing Director Francis Wedin said.
The company is targeting an annual lithium hydroxide output of 40,000 tonnes from 2024 – roughly enough to power one million electric vehicles (EVs). Its plans have already seen Vulcan ink deals with numerous European carmakers, all of whom are desperate to secure lithium supplies, including France’s Renault, Dutch company Stellantis and Germany’s Volkswagen.
It’s worth noting that lithium extraction has come under fairly fierce criticism in Europe, and getting the project across the line in terms of environmental and social licenses in such a rich and densely populated region in Europe may prove difficult. 
Vulcan’s lithium plans are still in fairly early stages, and were probably somewhat shaken by the recent and very public end to Rio Tinto’s $3.3 billion Jadar lithium-borates project in Serbia – which came shortly after the country’s tennis star Novak Djokovic was deported from Australia.

Boston-based PolyJoule, a spin-off of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), recently unveiled a new battery technology based on its own proprietary conductive polymers and other organic, non-metallic materials.
“Our batteries are designed to suit the needs of stationary power applications where safety, lifetime, levelised costs, and environmental footprints are key decision drivers,” the company said in a statement. “PolyJoule’s conductive polymer cells span the performance curve between traditional lead-acid batteries and modern lithium-ion cells, while enhancing service life and reducing balance of plant costs, due to their no-HVAC thermal management design.”
According to the manufacturer, the battery cells were tested to perform for 12,000 cycles at 100% depth of discharge. The device is based on a standard, two-electrode electrochemical cell containing the conductive polymers, a carbon-graphene hybrid, and a non-flammable liquid electrolyte. Alternating anodes and cathodes are interwoven and then connected in parallel to form a cell.
The battery may be used for utility and industrial applications such as power conditioning, peak shaving, frequency regulation, hybrid power energy storage, and high-power datacenter backup, the company said.
According to the MIT Technology Review, the battery packs are up to five times larger than lithium-ion systems of the same capacity and don’t require active temperature control. The product is being offered in power strings which the company said can rapidly discharge power, up to 1 MW, in less than 10 seconds and be recharged in less than five minutes.
Each power string measures 2.2 m x 0.8 m x 3.4 m and weighs 1,590 kg. Its nominal voltage is 528 V and the voltage range is 158 V to 972 V. The manufacturer ensures continuous operation at temperatures between -40 C and 50 C with minimal capacity loss. The battery contains no lithium, cobalt or lead and, according to PolyJoule, it is from abundantly available raw materials with no rare earth elements.

There’s no substitute for experience and researchers in the US have acknowledged the fact by coming up with a machine learning method for producing perovskite solar cells which can incorporate the observations of seasoned production line staff.
Academics from US institutions MIT and Stanford – plus the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Science and Technology – have come up with an artificial intelligence (AI) system which can include input from experienced workers as well as data from experiments conducted by other researchers, to help control the many variables which can affect mass production of perovskite cells.
The researchers, whose paper has been published in the latest issue of Joule, came up with the AI system to improve the rapid spray plasma processing (RSPP) production method they have suggested for commercial production of perovskite solar cells. An article published on the MIT News website on Wednesday about the research stated: “The [RSPP] manufacturing process would involve a moving roll-to-roll surface, or series of sheets on which the precursor solutions for the perovskite compound would be sprayed or ink-jetted as the sheet rolled by. The material would then move on to a curing stage, providing a rapid and continuous output.”
The machine learning code developed by the academics has been placed on open-source software development site GitHub, from where perovskite solar manufacturers can download it and MIT professor of mechanical engineering Tonio Buonassisi said the researchers are contacting PV companies to make them aware of the code and their RSPP approach to perovskite manufacture.
The AI method has been directed by the researchers to optimise the power output of perovskite cells but Buonassisi said his colleagues are working on being able to direct it to maximise cost and durability, as well as other potential characteristics, at the same time.
Former MIT research assistant Zhe Liu, one of the academics who worked on the project and is now at the Northwestern Polytechnical University, in the Chinese city of Xi-an, told MIT News Chinese perovskite solar companies are focused on small products such as solar roofing tiles but three manufacturers are being pressed by investors, or are already on track, to produce full-sized perovskite solar panels “within two years.”
The research, which was backed by US public bodies the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation, also involved Stanford academics Reinhold Dauskardt, professor of materials science and engineering; doctoral graduate Nicholas Rolston; and Austin Flick and Thomas Colburn; as well as Zekun Ren, of the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Science and Technology.

Energy Dome is a winner in the Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) Pioneers 2022 technology competition for its development and commercialisation of the CO2 Battery long-duration energy storage technology, under the category “providing round-the-clock zero-emissions power.”  Energy Dome is the first Italian company to win the prestigious competition.
Energy Dome’s emission-free energy storage method uses carbon dioxide in a closed loop charge/discharge cycle that can store and dispatch renewable energy onto the grid over periods from four to 24 hours. Energy Dome reports that it plans to build energy storage projects at half the cost of lithium-ion battery storage technology globally. Energy Dome’s first commercial CO2 Battery storage facility is under construction in Sardinia, Italy and now offers the CO2 Battery on utility scale, with performance warranties.
Energy Dome also recently signed an agreement with Ansaldo Energia that envisions developing as many as 30 energy storage facilities over the next five years in Italy, Germany, the Middle East, and Africa. The facilities will use Energy Dome’s non-flammable, non-toxic carbon dioxide-based energy storage solution to store and dispatch power around the clock.
BNEF Pioneers annually identifies the most promising and impactful technologies that can accelerate global decarbonisation and halt climate change. Pioneers such as Energy Dome are innovators in sectors including energy, transport, materials, manufacturing, consumer products, and agriculture.
“To be selected as a BNEF Pioneers 2022 winner is not only a huge honour, but also a strong validation of our technology and product, the CO2 Battery, which we are deploying at commercial scale,” said Claudio Spadacini, Energy Dome founder and CEO . “We are already seeing strong global interest in the CO2 Battery, which uses tried and tested components, costs half of lithium-ion technology, is highly efficient (Round Trip Efficiency 75+%) and has no performance degradation during its 30+ year project lifetime. We believe the CO2 Battery will help significantly accelerate the clean energy transition by replacing baseload fossil fuels with fully dispatchable solar and wind energy.”
