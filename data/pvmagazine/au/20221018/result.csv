The new purpose-built facility features a pilot production line to manufacture advanced battery pouch cells, as well as a dedicated research laboratory for new battery design, development, and prototyping. Crucially, it will also have a cell and systems test facility for multiple battery types and sizes.
Alongside educating future workers, Deakin says the hub will further Victoria’s role in the global supply chain for advanced batteries, as well as meet the bespoke and specialised battery needs of industry partners, including catering specifically to the defence and agriculture sectors, as well as for disaster zones and health settings.

Funding for the east Melbourne facility came from both the Victorian government, which allocated $5.2 million, and Deakin University, which provided $5.1 million.
The Battery Hub is actually one of two major projects at the university to have attracted significant state government funding, the other being Deakin’s Hycel Technology Hub for hydrogen.
Having secured a total of $14 million from the Victorian government, the lion’s share of that, $9 million, was allocated to Hycel.
This Hycel Technology Hub, similar to the battery hub, will be devoted to the development, testing, training, demonstration and manufacture of hydrogen fuel technology at scale.

It is being constructed on Deakin’s Warrnambool campus, on the coast in Victoria’s west – a region slated to become one of Australia’s future regional hydrogen hubs as part of the National Hydrogen Strategy. It is planned to include a fuel cell wing with specialised fuel cell assembly and testing equipment, plumbed with hydrogen.
At the time of the funding announcement in 2021, Deakin expected Hycel to be completed by December this year – though it appears the launch of both hubs have run slightly behind schedule.
Like the battery hub, the Hycel facility is intended to develop an education pipeline.
Deakin has no shortage of interesting renewable technology projects on the go. Also in 2021, the university opened its new microgrid at the Waurn Ponds campus. The microgrid isn’t just a means for the university to power itself renewably, but also serves as a “living laboratory” – a chance to model, test, and optimise what’s possible with power.
Deakin University
“We have 6,000 data points on our microgrid,” Director of Deakin’s Energy Initiative, Dr Adrian Panow, told pv magazine Australia at the time. “So it becomes a very complex system very, very quickly.”
The $23 million microgrid is comprised of a 7 MW solar farm (made up of 23,000 ground mounted solar panels – the largest on any Australian university campus), a 2 MWh lithium iron phosphate battery, 250 kW of distributed rooftop solar (833 panels) as well as a series of smaller battery systems with a collective capacity of 30 kWh.
Additionally, earlier this year Deakin was awarded $50 million in federal funding for its Recycling and Renewable Energy Commercialisation Hub, or ‘REACH’ project. The university at the time claimed it would be the largest recycling and clean energy advanced manufacturing ecosystem in Australia.
Deakin isn’t Australia’s only beacon for renewable technologies and research – with important research being done at the University of New South Wales, the Australian National University, the Universities of Technology in Sydney and Queensland, and Wollongong – just to name a few.

Up to September 2022, 26,356 EVs were sold in Australia, making up 3.39% of all new cars – a 65% increase from EV’s market share of 2% in 2021, according to the Electric Vehicle Council’s State of EVs report published Friday.

In the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), the percentage of EV sales among new cars rose to 9.5% – a figure surely set increase given the ACT’s recent announcement it would end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2035, bringing it into closer alignment with policies in Europe and North America.
The primary barrier to EV adoption remains a lack of vehicle supply, said the EV Council, which is calling for a “strong and serious national EV strategy.”

In terms of the models available to Australians, the country had a total of just 45, with 95 variants. Most of the models, 60%, are battery electric vehicles (BEV), with 35% plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV). There were 18 models of both electric trucks and utility vehicles, as well as 18 electric buses available.
The Tesla brand dominated with its Model 3 accounting for 33% of all sales. Tesla’s Model Y took out the second spot in the ‘top five models’, followed by MG, Hyundai and Polestar.

Australia now has 3,669 public chargers across 2,147 locations. Of those, 274 were fast charger locations and 82 are classed as ‘ultra-fast charging’. (For reference, regular charging is up to 24 kW of AC/DC, fast charging is classed as between 24 – 99 kW DC, and ultra-fast is 100 kW+ DC).

The report includes a lengthy breakdown of policy areas surrounding EVs, looking at incentives, regulation, charging infrastructure, user road charges, and more across all the state governments.

New South Wales and the Capital Territory shared the top spot, scoring 8/10. They were followed by the federal government, on 7/10, Queensland (6/10); Victoria (5/10); SA, NT and WA (4/10), and Tasmania (3/10).
While the shift to electric vehicles will no doubt play a role in Australia’s decarbonisation, the proposition of switching internal combustion cars for EVs without any further behaviour change surrounding transport remains highly questionable.

EV battery production is an energy-intensive process, as is car manufacturing as a whole. “Producing electric vehicles leads to significantly more emissions than producing petrol cars. Depending on the country of production, that’s between 30% to 40% extra in production emissions, which is mostly from the battery production,” fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Environment, Energy and Natural Resource Governance, Florian Knobloch, told CNBC in 2021. 
Though these high emissions in initial manufacturing are offset by EVs lowered emissions during the car’s lifespan, reducing overall personal car use and opting for public transport and cycling remain far more sustainable transport options.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/18/australian-manufacturer-achieves-32-efficiency-for-inorganic-perovskite-solar-cell/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 18, 2022",Australian manufacturer achieves 32% efficiency for inorganic perovskite solar cell,"GreatCell Solar has achieved a power conversion efficiency of 32% for a 100% inorganic perovskite cell designed for indoor applications. 
“This is a single-junction, single cell with linear conduction width of 1.5 cm to simulate product-sized cells,” the company’s managing director, Paul Moonie, told pv magazine. “The inorganic perovskite crystallises at room temperature, so processing is compatible with common flexible substrates.”
The Australian perovskite solar cell maker said the result is a world record for inorganic perovskite solar cells.
“It was not certified by an independent entity, as there is no established independent certification for low-light solar cell performance,” Moonie said. “However, we do comply with all relevant international standards such as IEC 63163, including for long-term stability and durability testing.”
The company built the cell with roll-to-roll coating technology. It designed the cell without a hole transport layer (HTL) and using carbon composite back contact, which it claims has excellent electrical conductivity.
“We are in the process of moving from semi-tech to full-scale production using this manufacturing technique,” he said, noting that, with further improving, the optoelectronic quality of perovskite and its interfaces, plus carbon composites-based back contact, may soon reach an efficiency of 40%. “Our aim is not just producing high-performance and long-life solar cells, but also utilising low-cost materials. In saying that, our efficiencies are currently much higher than off-the-shelf indoor PV, and our potential customers are satisfied with our performance to offer advanced power solutions to their Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices.”
In 2021, GreatCell acquired a solar module factory in Australia from Tindo Solar. In May, it announced plans to expand the factory.

In the announcement, Akaysha confirmed it is contracted to deliver a battery capable of providing a guaranteed continuous active power capacity of at least 700 MW and a guaranteed useable energy storage capacity of at least 1,400 MWh.
The company added, however, the physical size of the of battery storage system is anticipated to be 850 MW / 1,680 MWh, allowing the company to trade the additional 150 MW/ 280 MWh of capacity in the electricity market as well as potentially releasing it during off-peak times.

The news comes just a day after the former coal-fired Munmorah Power Station, owned by the state government, on the NSW Central Coast was revealed as the project’s site.
Akaysha Energy’s winning bid for the tender saw it lead a consortium which also included US equipment manufacturer Powin and Consolidated Power Projects Australia (CPP). 
Powin will provide the battery hardware and software, deploying its modular Centipede battery energy storage system (BESS) platform and Stack OS control system. Powin’s wholly owned subsidiary, EKS Energy, will provide the power conversion systems.
CPP has then been selected as the Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) company for the project, and will be responsible for all site works, including the battery system’s installation, and high voltage connections.
Located about 100 kilometres north of Sydney and approximately 25 kilometres south of the retiring Eraring coal-fired power station, the battery will be built on a 138,000 square metre site – around the size of eight AFL fields.

The NSW government is delivering the Waratah Super Battery project as part of its response to the anticipated early closure of Eraring, which is owned by Origin Energy and expected to retire in August 2025. Eraring currently represents about 25% of NSW’s thermal generating capacity, so its closure requires serious consideration to preserve the grid’s system integrity.
Matt Kean, NSW’s energy minister and treasurer, was revealed to have been in discussions with Origin Energy about Eraring’s early closure – discussions the then federal energy minister, Angus Taylor, was not a part of. With these discussions beginning long before the early closure was announced earlier this year, it appears the Waratah Super Battery has been considered by the state government for quite some time.

The Waratah battery will operate as part of what’s called a System Integrity Protection Scheme, developed by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), as a way to secure primarily transmission capacity and stability, rather than additional electricity storage capacity. Hence the frequent references to Waratah acting as a “shock absorber”.
The System Integrity Protection Scheme appears to have been first used with Neoen’s Victorian Big Battery (VBB), commissioned last year. In 2021, Neoen was awarded the contract to supply up to 250 MW of energy reserve from its 300 MW / 450 MWh battery to increase the capability of the Victoria to New South Wales Interconnector (VNI) over the summer.
The scheme helps reframe and solidify the range of uses big batteries can serve in Australia’s grid.
Coming back to the Waratah Super Battery, the project has already been declared Critical State Significant Infrastructure by the NSW government. AEMO has also already identified it as an “actionable NSW project”, which means it considers the project’s development should commence as soon as possible.
The Energy Corporation of NSW (EnergyCo), which appointed Akaysha Energy as the project’s service provider, has previously said construction will begin in early 2023, pending approval, and to be completed by mid-2025 in advance of Eraring’s earliest closure date.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/18/pv-production-equipment-sales-soaring-in-europe/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,EUROPE,GERMANY,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"OCTOBER 18, 2022",PV production equipment sales soaring in Europe,"From pv magazine Global
VDMA (Verbandes Deutsches Maschinenbau Anlage), a German engineering association, has published an update to its annual International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaics (ITRPV) report.
In the second quarter, German PV production equipment providers saw a trend reversal. Incoming orders and sales, which had been limited since the start of the pandemic, rose by 62% compared to the previous quarter. Sales to European solar manufacturers have quadrupled over this period.
For the first time since VDMA began collecting statistics in 2008, incoming orders from European PV manufacturers were higher than those from their Asian counterparts.
“The European orders received in the first two quarters of 2022 have already exceeded the value of all European orders in 2021 fourfold,” the association said.
The industry expects an increase in sales for the third quarter, mainly due to the clearance of bottlenecks in the supply chain. And the biggest growth driver for equipment manufacturers is still the module production business.
Machines in this area accounted for almost one-third of total sales in the second quarter. In terms of sales, Asian solar manufacturers remain the most important source of income for German suppliers, at least for now, says VDMA.
“Although the orders in Asia are lower than in Europe in the second quarter of 2022, Asia is still at the top of the sales volume with a 52% share of the total market,” VDMA said.
In addition, sales in the United States increased from the preceding quarter, but orders fell slightly. According to the association, the current export rate for European PV production kit is 66%.
“In the past, the Asian market was the largest for German PV equipment providers, but orders in Europe have increased since the first quarter of 2022 and are expected to continue to increase,” said Jutta Trube, head of the photovoltaic production equipment department at VDMA. “In general, we expect continued strong demand due to the increasing interest in various countries in new local photovoltaic production.”
Supply chain bottlenecks from the pandemic have still not been completely overcome.
“Incoming orders for PV production machines from the EU increased in the second quarter,” said Peter Fath, managing director of RCT Solutions GmbH and Chairman of the VDMA Photovoltaic Production Equipment department. “The solar machine manufacturers are recording positive sales despite the ongoing pandemic-related supply chain bottlenecks and the shortage of skilled workers.”
Nevertheless, further increases in sales can be expected.
“The manufacturers of PV production equipment in the EU can cope with these bottlenecks and successfully defy these imponderables,” Fath said.
In addition, the political will in Europe to rebuild the solar industry is now tangible. Numerous initiatives are now aimed at reinvigorating the entire PV value chain in Europe.
“Currently, countries like the US and India are introducing very attractive initiatives to boost photovoltaic production; the same is required in Europe,” said Fath.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/18/global-polysilicon-capacity-could-hit-536-gw-by-end-of-2023/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 18, 2022",Global polysilicon capacity could hit 536 GW by end of 2023,"From pv magazine Global
In its PV supplier report for the second quarter of 2022, solar and storage advisory Clean Energy Associates (CEA) said that polysilicon production capacity could reach 295 GW by the end of 2022, and 536 GW by the end of 2023.
CEA said it expects this production capacity to far exceed solar installations next year. While this may suggest that supply problems could begin to be alleviated, CEA said PV module capacity expansion is slowing. Many manufacturers are instead expanding cell production capacity, in support of the n-type TOPCon and HJT manufacturing trends.
Ingot capacity grew almost 30 GW in the second quarter, said CEA. It attributed this to two facilities that brought 23 GW online. Wafer capacity decreased slightly, said CEA, primarily because a major undisclosed supplier retired its multicrystalline wafer capacity. The 17 suppliers covered in the report boosted cell capacity by 22% in the second quarter of 2022, bringing 47 GW of capacity online, reaching a total of 262 GW.
PV module production reached 324 GW in the second quarter. CEA said it expects this could expand by 20% by this end of the year to reach 400 GW.
Only seven suppliers covered by the CEA report are fully vertically integrated from ingot to module production. Most of the others operate at the cell and module link in the supply chain.
“With growing merchant wafer options, there is little need for most suppliers to expand upstream,” said CEA.
It said suppliers are working to optimise wafer sizes after the industry standardised 210 mm (G12) and 182 mm (M10) module dimensions. The “182 mm Plus” (182P) has increased wafer heights to further reduce “white space” caused by intercell gaps to achieve up to 5 W of additional output, said CEA. The “210 mm Reduced” (210R) slashed wafer widths for niche rooftop applications at the expense of power output. CEA said it expects new module sizes for the residential solar market to be introduced.
Many analysts have predicted China will break 100 GW of installations this year. CEA expects slightly lower installations in China during 2022 due to high module prices impacting utility-scale projects. It said many investment decisions have been deferred, as projects could not meet their internal rate of return thresholds.
Most of the polysilicon supply chain originates in China. Outside of China, production capacities are 11 GW of ingots, 42 GW of cells, and 50 GW of modules. By the end of 2023, these capacities are expected to expand to 23 GW, 73 GW, and 74 GW, respectively.
“Policy uncertainties continue to defer expansion plans of suppliers as they remain cautious due to lingering policy uncertainty in the United States surrounding the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and anticircumvention investigation,” said CEA.
