This is a little strange, as pv magazine reported on the start of Girgarre’s construction back in January.
Nonetheless, Enel says Girgarre Solar Farm will be in construction for the next 18 months, and is targeting operations for early 2025. The $140 million (USD 89 million) project will consist of approximately 169,500 solar panels and has an operational life expectancy of 35 years.
The project, which is located approximately 50 kilometres west of Shepparton, is perhaps most interesting though because it received no objections from the local community in its permitting and planning stages. This is despite the fact the project is located in an agricultural area – where land use tends to be highly contentious issue.

Earlier this year, pv magazine Australia spoke to Peter Leeson, who initially developed the project before selling it to Enel. He said that he isn’t trained in community consultation per se, and that the real trick was simply being present and available for locals. “Nothing negates what you are going to achieve by spending a long time in the community,” Leeson said. “It’s just spending that time with them and communicating with them.”
In those early stages of project development, a crop self seeded up on the Girgarre site, which had formerly been a crop farm. The sale of the harvest generated $70,000 which was given to a local community group Girgarre Development Group, who used it to upgrade shared facilities in town.
Community engagement for renewable energy projects has been wanting in Australia, with many sources outside the industry reporting that renewables companies have tended to treat the process as a box ticking exercise. As a result, social license for projects is diminishing rapidly and becoming an increasingly alarming problem for Australia’s energy transition – with numerous state government’s flagging this.
In July, Japanese oil and gas giant Inpex agreed to buy 50% of Enel Green Power Australia, handing it joint control of its asset portfolio. Enel currently operates three renewable energy plants in Australia, totalling around 310 MW, with a 76 MW wind project under construction in Western Australia.
It says it is “targeting a significant increase to its installed capacity across wind, solar, storage and hybrid projects across Australia,” and will use the new partnership to springboard this.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/27/australia-in-midst-of-solar-market-shakeup-with-tw-solar-entrance-historic-global-pricing-plunge/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,WORLD",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2023","Australia in midst of solar market shakeup with TW Solar entrance, historic global pricing plunge","The price of solar panels in Australia started to fall around June, but solar and storage analyst Sunwiz says we are still yet to see the full ramifications of the global supply glut.
Adding to this global situation is the fact major manufacturer Tongwei Solar, which sells in Australia mostly under the brand TW Solar, has blazed into the Australian market this year, shifting former marketshare dynamics.
Although Tongwei is an established company, it formerly had no presence in the Australian market and was largely focussed on upstream solar manufacturing. It began seeking out Clean Energy Council approval for its own brand of panels in 2020, but has significantly ramped up its presence in 2023.
“Definitely the entrance of TW Solar in the market has shaken things up,” Sunwiz managing director Warwick Johnston told pv magazine Australia.

Despite being competitive in its pricing, it appears TW Solar has actually carved out most of its marketshare from the premium end of town, Johnston says. Premium panel marketshare was previously sitting at around 20% and is now down around 10%, he noted. “So it feels like Tongwei’s taken it from the premium end.”
Moreover, Tongwei are “not the only ones knocking on the doors of Australians,” Johnston says, noting a recent uptick in manufacturers expanding into the Australian market.
“So there’s super cheap panels that are coming through and everyone will have to adjust their prices accordingly,” he says.
The entrance of new players coincides with the global free fall in solar panel pricing, of which  pvXchange’s Martin Schachinger recently said: “Never before in the history of photovoltaics have panel prices plummeted so significantly in such a short space of time.”

On average, global prices in all module categories have been corrected downwards by around 10%. It is worth noting that module prices rose by more than 50% between October 2020 and October 2022, so until recently, solar prices were higher than they had been for a long time. 
“Now things have completely changed… the speed and intensity of this change, however, surprise even experienced market participants,” Schachinger said, pointing out that increased manufacturing capacity, a module glut in Europe and regulations in the US have shifted the pricing landscape.
In Australia, the average panel price started shifting down in June, dropping from an average of $1.11/W to $1.06 in August (see top banner graph). While this is a significant drop already, Johnston says the bargain prices panels are selling for internationally haven’t even reached Australia yet.
“It takes a while for those things to flow through to Australia,” he says. “But it’s going to flow through.”
Obviously this benefits consumers, but it isn’t good news for Australian solar companies. As Sunwiz noted in a recent article, “the plunging price of solar panels is the biggest challenge emerging for Australian solar industry.”
“This plunge will have a wide-felt, mostly negative impact across panel manufacturers, distributors, retailers… and even inverter manufacturers,” it added.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/27/tesla-megapack-on-fire-at-bouldercombe-big-battery-in-queensland/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EVENTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2023",Tesla Megapack on fire at Bouldercombe big battery in Queensland,"The Queensland Fire and Emergency Services crews remain on scene after arriving at the lithium battery facility around 7.45pm on September 26.
The fire is believed to have only impacted one of the 40 Tesla Megapack modules at the Bouldercombe battery, which was in its commissioning stages.
In its latest update at 8.20am Wednesday morning, Queensland’s Fire and Rescue Service (QFRS) said crews remain at the site on Childs Avenue, Bouldercombe, roughly 20 kilometres south of Rockhampton on Queensland’s midcoast.

“The fire is currently contained with crews continuing to monitor the situation,” the QFRS said.“Low-lying smoke is expected to persist in the area over the coming hours.” The fire service noted there has been “large amounts” smoke, urging residents to keep windows and doors shut.
The 50 MW / 100 MWh Bouldercombe battery is owned by Genex Power – the $60 million project marked the company’s first foray into big batteries. The fire is not believed to have impacted other infrastructure, including the Powerlink substation next to the battery facility. 
The cause of the fire remains unknown, and the site has been disconnected from the grid. 
In a statement Genex Power said: “Genex is working with Tesla Motors Australia Pty Ltd and Consolidated Power Projects Pty Ltd to investigate the root cause of the incident.”

In 2021, a Tesla Megapack battery unit also caught fire and burned for three days in the final stages of completing the Victorian big battery facility in Moorabool, Victoria.
A year later, in 2022, it was widely reported that Tesla had switched its Megapack battery cell chemistry to lithium-iron-phosphate or LFP cells, which are more fire resistant than earlier makeups.
It is not known if the Bouldercombe units were fitted with LFP cells or an earlier Tesla Megapack technology, however.

Fires in lithium-ion batteries are tricky for fire services to bring under control as they emit toxic gases and water is not recommended to bring them under control. “Firefighters are trained not to open the battery casing for water application to the cells due to the hazards of high voltage stranded energy and risk of electrocution,” a spokesperson from Fire and Rescue NSW told pv magazine, which covered the Victorian big battery fire and lithium battery risks at length in a 2021 edition.
“The preferred option as advocated by manufacturers is to allow the battery to completely burn out, removing all hazards,” the spokesperson added at the time.

Coming back to Bouldercombe, it is believed the Queensland fire services have treated this fire similarly.
Watt Clarity looked at the Bouldercombe battery’s bidding behaviour in the lead up to the fire. It noted the unit had run for around two hours before the fire, with its first output logged at 18:05 and last output at 19:55 local time. It was bidding at $60/MWh.
“It [Bouldercombe battery unit] appears to have a Dispatch Error of ~4MW from 19:35 as it missed its 48 MW target (Final MW of 44 MW) for the remaining dispatch intervals,” Watt Clarity noted, questioning whether this was a result of whatever led to fire.
Tesla has not only supplied the Bouldercombe battery technology, but had also penned an offtake deal with Genex Power for the output of the facility. Under the offtake deal, Tesla agreed to operate the Bouldercombe project using its proprietary algorithm-based bidding system, Autobidder. At the completion of the eight-year deal, Genex is set to enter into a license agreement with Tesla to operate Autobidder on the project.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/27/redflow-lands-biggest-contract-yet-for-californian-hospital-microgrid/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2023",Redflow lands biggest contract yet for Californian hospital microgrid,"From pv magazine USA
A microgrid project is getting underway at Valley Children’s Hospital in Madera, California, led by the State of California through the California Energy Commission, and joined by Faraday Microgrids and Redflow, providing zinc bromine flow batteries.
Faraday Microgrids, project developer said that the project is “groundbreaking in the advancement of the total capacity and duration of emergency power support.” Located in an area of the country that’s vulnerable to power outages, the microgrid is designed to provide resiliency to the pediatric facility.
The project received funding from Department of Energy (DOE), which announced up to USD 325 million ($507 million) for 15 projects across 17 states and one tribal nation to accelerate the development of long-duration energy storage (LDES) technologies. The DOE funding supports the DOE’s Long Duration Storage Shot, which establishes a target to reduce the cost of grid-scale energy storage by 90% for systems that deliver 10+ hours of duration within the decade.
The Children’s Hospital Resilient Grid with Energy Storage (CHARGES) project is intended to enable the hospital to replace diesel generators with cleaner, more cost-effective resources, while also serving as a roadmap for other hospitals to use to build similar systems. Faraday Microgrids has been working closely with the California Energy Commission to develop and demonstrate the capabilities of renewable energy microgrids as a source of backup power in hospitals.
The CHARGES project will install a 34.4 MWh behind-the-meter, zinc bromide flow battery system from Redflow Limited. Redflow, an Australian company, produces zinc-bromine flow batteries designed to work in harsh conditions in deep cycling, LDES applications in the commercial & industrial sector. The company recently announced that  its energy storage solutions have been approved by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) as part of the state’s Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP). With SGIP approval, Redflow expects its flow batteries to be more economically attractive, as the state incentives support wider deployment across disadvantaged communities within the state.
“Our batteries are ideally suited for daily use in the Central Valley’s extreme heat, and we’re proud to provide the resources the hospital needs to ensure safe, reliable operations,” said Redflow CEO and managing director, Tim Harris. “This combination of our technology leadership, Faraday’s trusted microgrid solutions, and the funding provided by the CEC and DOE all assist in transitioning communities to a cleaner, more energy-efficient future.”
In addition to Redflow batteries, the microgrid will be paired with solar and other renewable energy resources such as fuel cells to support decarbonisation and to ensure that the hospital stays up and running in the event of wildfires, earthquakes and other events that cause power outages.
