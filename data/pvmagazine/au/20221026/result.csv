Fresh of his receipt of the WCPEC award, which was bestowed every four years at the world’s biggest academic solar conference held last month in Milan, Green has been awarded the $1.55 million Millennium Technology Prize in Helsinki.
The prize is awarded every two years by the Technology Academy Finland. Previous winners include Tim Berners-Lee for the World Wide Web, Shuji Nakamura for his work on LED lighting, and Robert Langer from his work on mRNA vaccines.
In a statement announcing the award, the Chair of the Technical Academy of Finland Minna Palmroth said: “Professor Green’s innovation has already significantly improved the quality of life for billions of people worldwide and will continue to do so. It promotes environmentally sustainable development, from national power grids to private homes.”
The Millennium Technology Prize International Jury Chair Päivi Törmä added that the PERC cell assists in providing “low-cost energy solutions to address climate change.” Pointing to Green’s current work in identifying and boosting the efficiency of abundant, non-toxic thin film solar cells, she noted, “research on solar cells is needed to replace those of their components that are available in limited quantities – such as silver – with alternatives that are more abundant.”
Speaking with pv magazine Australia, Green said that the acceleration of solar module price declines that occurred from 2016 through to 2020 can be attributed to the widespread adoption of PERC technology.
“My take on that is that the pressure that PERC was putting on the multicystalline manufacturers [starting in 2016] forced them drop prices in an attempt to maintain their market share,” said Green, “so PERC was the thing that accelerated their cost reduction.
“Until mid 2020, when the coronavirus and other issues destroyed the steady cost reductions that had been achieved since 2016, it was a pretty steady 22% rate that the technology was reducing in price.
“So, we credit PERC in that transition and if you extrapolate from 2016 to the end of 2020 at 12% a year or 22% a year, then you get PERC, with the accelerated cost reduction, to an average selling price of 54% of what it would’ve been at a business-as-usual scenario. We consequently claim that PERC has accelerated the cost of reduction to nearly double what it would’ve been without PERC having been introduced.”
With PERC approaching its physical limits in terms of conversion efficiency, Green has turned his attention to PV thin films, which may be options for stacking onto a c-Si cell – a tandem cell. Currently copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS) is proving a promising candidate, and is a cell with which the UNSW team have made considerable progress.
“We hold the world record at the UNSW for CZTS – the pure sulfide version,” said Green. “That seems to have all of the attributes that we are after; the constituents are all benign elements and all pretty abundant so it’s the closest thing to artificial silicon that you can make. But getting the efficiency up to 20% is proving difficult, we’re presently at around 12%.”
The 2022 ceremony celebrating Green’s innovation will take place as part of the Millennium Innovation Forum, also hosted by the Technical Academy of Finland and held Oct. 25-26.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/26/unsw-researchers-develop-high-yield-low-cost-eco-friendly-process-to-recycle-si-pv-modules/,"RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"OCTOBER 26, 2022","UNSW researchers develop high yield, low cost, eco-friendly process to recycle Si-PV modules","As the decommissioning volume keeps increasing, the proper disposal of PV modules has become an emerging environmental and social issue. But while the recycling of silicon PV modules is technically viable, it is often not feasible economically due to reasons that vary from high processing cost to low waste volumes that do not justify investment cost.
Now, a team of UNSW researchers has proposed a novel, simple, cost-effective and environmentally friendly method to recycle silicon PV modules. The process consists of module deframing, laminate shredding and material concentration using electrostatic separation.
The process outputs two fractions: a valuable mixture of silver, copper, aluminium and silicon, and a mixture of mostly glass, silicon and polymers. The valuable mixture accounts for only 2-3 wt% of the total module, which can be forwarded to the downstream industry for further refinement.
According to the researchers, the process can be profitable and is advantageous when dealing with small volumes, for instance 1,000 tons of solar panels a year.
Specifically, their paper evaluates the technical aspects of the process (quantifies material separation, energy and time) while using life cycle assessment and life cycle costing to evaluate the environmental impacts and economic prospects, respectively. The results are compared to a full recovery alternative (FRELP) and to landfilling.
Economic assessment shows the process has potential to be more profitable than FRELP at lower waste volumes (smaller than 4 kt/year), because of the smaller equipment capital cost, and if there is no market for the recovered glass, which is currently the case in many locations. Not to mention when the end-processing industry is located afar, since only the valuable mixture would require shipping.
Environmentally, a full recovery is preferred, followed by the proposed process, both of which have a net positive impact and are better than landfilling the whole module, the researchers write in their paper titled “High yield, low cost, environmentally friendly process to recycle silicon solar panels: Technical, economic and environmental feasibility assessment” published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews.
Around 1.7 million tonnes of waste volume of end-of-life PV modules are expected by 2030 under the regular loss scenario of a 2016 analysis by the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA PVSP) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), with approximately 60 million tonnes expected by 2050. If the early loss scenario pans out, there could be 8 million tonnes of PV waste by 2030, and a total of 78 million tonnes by 2050.
And while recycling solar panels rather than sending them to landfills addresses an important environmental issue, material recovery is also projected to become big business.
Norwegian consultancy Rystad Energy estimates that recyclable materials from PV panels at the end of their lifespan will be worth more than $4.2 billion (USD 2.7 billion) in 2030, up from only $262 million this year, and the value will approach $123 billion by 2050.
Rystad projects that solar PV waste will grow to 27 million tonnes per annum by 2040, and they estimate that recovered materials from retired panels could make up 6% of solar investments by 2040, compared to only 0.08% today.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/26/nsw-payments-for-hosting-new-transmission-lines-set-to-double/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",MARIJA MAISCH,"OCTOBER 26, 2022",NSW payments for hosting new transmission lines set to double,"Private landowners in New South Wales (NSW) will be offered $200,000 (USD 127,000) per kilometre for hosting new transmission infrastructure on their land as the state government looks to beef up the grid for renewable energy uptake.
Under the Strategic Benefit Payments Scheme, announced by the NSW government on Oct. 25, the average payments for hosting high voltage lines received by landowners across the state will be nearly doubled to at least $10,000 for each kilometre of transmission wire. Payments will be given in instalments over 20 years, indexed to CPI.
Minister for Energy Matt Kean said maximising the economic benefits of this new infrastructure and supporting regional communities is central to the NSW energy transition plan, targeting 12 GW of renewable energy capacity and 2 GW of storage by 2030.
The scheme will apply for new major transmission projects, including the Central-West Orana Transmission Project, Project EnergyConnect, HumeLink, the New England Transmission Project and the Hunter Transmission Project. Most of this new infrastructure will be built in regional NSW.
“This is a huge win for landowners across NSW that will almost double the average payment they currently receive – and importantly – the rate of the payments will be calculated in the same way regardless of where you live to ensure all landowners are treated equitably under the scheme,” Kean said.
But while key for the energy transition, transmission projects have often been met with community backlash. Landowners have voiced concerns about fire risks, devaluation of property, visual impacts, and compensation.
Most recently, landowners in the path of a proposed 360-kilometre transmission line across NSW – the HumeLink – have expressed frustration it will not be going underground in the Snowy Mountains, as originally planned.
Now, the NSW government’s new compensation scheme has been met with mixed reactions. Farmers for Climate Action, an organisation representing more than 7,000 farmers nationally, welcomed the NSW government’s move, saying that it has “set the benchmark for power line payments in Australia.”
“Farmers for Climate Action applauds this policy, which has the potential to bring renewables online faster whilst giving farmers alternative sources of income,” Farmers for Climate Action CEO Fiona Davis said. “Alternative income is so important during times like droughts, or in recovering from floods, which climate change has already brought far too much of.”
However, community group Stop, Rethink HumeLink Towers criticised the scheme, saying transmission lines would blight the landscape and pose a major environmental risk.
