It was the consortium’s third buyout offer and valued Spark at $5.2 billion, after initially bidding just half that.
In an Australian Stock Exchange announcement, Spark confirmed it had accepted the offer, entering into a binding agreement with the consortium, which has completed its due diligence.
Spark Infrastructure owns a 49% stake in the Victorian distribution operators Powercor and CitiPower, 49% of South Australia’s distribution network operator SA Power Networks, and a 15% stake in transmission network operator Transgrid in New South Wales.
Until recently, Spark was exclusively an investor in regulated network infrastructure but it has begun developing a portfolio of wind, solar and storage assets, targeting more than $1 billion of investment in renewable energy generation by 2025.
In July, it announced plans to develop a 2.5 GW hybrid wind, solar PV and battery storage project in New South Wales while the 100 MW Bomen Solar Farm came online last year.
The company has also revealed it has plans to construct a 60 MW extension at the Bomen Solar Farm as well as a yet to be identified 150 MW solar+storage project and a 350 MW wind farm in NSW along with a massive 600 MW wind farm project in South Australia.
Under the agreement, the consortium will acquire all of the units in the Spark Infrastructure Trust by means of Trust Scheme and all of the loan notes issued by Spark RE by means of Creditors’ Scheme, the company’s statement said.

Together, solar, wind and hydro made up 57% of the national electricity generation. Coal, on the other hand, plunged to just 41.2%, or 9315 MW. It was the first time solar power has outstripped electricity generated from coal in the market’s two decade history.
As WattClarity’s Paul McArdle noted, the milestone came just a week after the National Electricity Market set a new record for minimum Operational Demand, hitting 15,061 MW on Sunday August 15, only to have that record broken on Sunday August 22, when demand dipped to just 14,193 MW.

The Australia Energy Market operator noted the low demand was likely driven by warm, sunny weather, meaning residential solar systems were cranking with few households drawing power for air conditioning or heating.
The momentous shift drove electricity prices into the negative for most of Sunday afternoon, leading clean energy advisor Simon Holmes à Court to note renewable energy could have made up an even higher portion of the energy mix had wind producers not opted to self-curtail to avoid the price hit.
“There was a significant amount of curtailment,” Holmes à Court told The Guardian. “What it shows is that there’s already more renewables that could have gone into the grid if the coal plants were more flexible and transmission was upgraded.”

Despite the happy trajectory of renewables, Australia is still a long way way from reaching a truly green grid. On Monday, the Clean Energy Investor Group, which represents 18 major institutional investors including billionaire Andrew Forrest’s Squadron Energy, called on the federal government to commit to a Step Change Scenario to avoid catastrophic climate change.
The Investor Group has taken particular issue with reforms recently presented to parliament by the Energy Security Board (ESB), which include a proposal to pay ageing coal and gas power plants to maintain their “capacity” to generate electricity if required. Critics say the move amounts to a governmental ‘coal-keeper’ package which will hinder the country’s clean energy transition.
Australia’s federal government has been the subject of increasing international scrutiny for its refusal to commit to net zero by 2050, a target most now see as falling far short of what’s needed.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/24/two-new-hydrogen-platforms-launch-to-couple-industry-with-customers/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"AUGUST 24, 2021",Two new hydrogen platforms launch to couple industry with customers,"Two new hydrogen platforms have launched in Australia, linking future hydrogen producers with consumers in a bid to kickstart Australia’s industry. HyCapability, the work of National Energy Resources Australia (NERA), will presumably map projects of every colour of the hydrogen rainbow, while the other, New South Wales’ dazzlingly named ‘hydrogen collaboration platform’ seems more focussed on the development of its two green hydrogen hubs in the Hunter and Illawarra regions.
Developed by federally funded NERA and Hydrogen Technology Cluster Australia, HyCapability is a free, online, searchable platform.
NERA says its platform aims to grow the hydrogen industry across the whole value chain, promote Australian hydrogen-related businesses to domestic and international markets, and create a baseline understanding of the country’s hydrogen industry.
“Australia is uniquely positioned to become a world leader in niche technologies and services that support the fast-emerging hydrogen industry. We just need to continue to seize every opportunity to showcase our capabilities, capability and experience to the global market,” NERA’s CEO Miranda Taylor said.
NERA’s HyCapability media release bares no mention of green or renewable hydrogen, and given the government’s championing of the oxymoronic “clean hydrogen” (hydrogen produced with fossil fuels), it seems highly likely the platform does not exclusively list renewable producers.

Launched on Monday by state environment minister Matt Kean, the NSW hydrogen collaboration platform seems to focus on linking emerging hydrogen producers with industrial energy users especially in the state’s two future hydrogen hubs: Port Kembla in the southern Illawarra region and the Hunter, in the state’s north.
“Green hydrogen will play a massive role in our future economic prosperity and decarbonising our economy,” Kean said in a statement on Monday. “We know that the best way to make green hydrogen commercially viable in Australia and NSW is to get to scale as quickly as possible. We also know our hydrogen hubs have the potential to become clean manufacturing powerhouses and we need to move fast, but that challenge is too big for one business alone.”
“That is why we are bringing decision-makers and investors who want to deploy hydrogen into their businesses and industries together to help deliver hydrogen in a way that will drive scale, reduce costs, focus innovation and grow our workforce capabilities.”
Part of the state’s New Zero Industry and Innovation Program, the NSW government has committed $750 million to reducing emissions, targeting especially industrial emissions. So far, $70 million has been set aside to develop its two green hydrogen hubs, which are both located in coal industry strongholds, with access to key export infrastructure and major industrial users, like BlueScope steel.

The findings are substantial – in comparison to the conventional roof, the solar array fitted above beds of plants had an average daily power output 39 kW, or 13.1%, greater.
The study was led by Peter Irga from the University of Technology Sydney and funded by the City of Sydney Council, with research carried out on International House’s conventional array and Daramu House’s green roof array, known as a bisolar roof.
City of Sydney/UTS
Both roofs generated substantial quantities of solar energy over the eight months they were studied, with the conventional roof yielding 59.5 MWh, while the green roof produced 69 MWh.
“Despite the similarities in build and location, the effect of urban geometry on solar irradiance on each rooftop is made evident outside of the hours during which the sun is near/at its solar peak… During these hours, the green roof produced an average energy output that was greater than the conventional roof by ~ 6 %. Prior to, and after these hours, the influence of urban geometry confounds the reportable efficiencies (-3.6 to 16 %)” the study read.
City of Sydney/UTS
After correcting for these differences, the panels on the green roof were found to be, on average, 3.63% more efficient on any given day. Following on from that, over the eight month study period the green roof produced an additional 9.5 MWh of green electricity, corresponding to a retail market value of $2,595.
This efficiency boost is thought to stem from the fact the green roof remained far cooler than the traditional concrete one during the day, meaning the panels did not overheat and therefore underperform. In some instances, the green roof was as much as 20°C cooler, with its temperatures also fluctuating far less in the evening.

While increasingly popular, there is currently a lack of research confirming the benefits of green roofs. Furthermore, “there is very little research that compares similar buildings which are exposed to similar environmental conditions by virtue of close proximity,” the study noted.
In addition the the significant increases in its solar array’s output, the green roof was also found to  have a nine-fold increase in insect species diversity, as well as a four-fold increase in avian species diversity. It also saw reductions in some air pollutants, improved stormwater management, improved building insulation.
“For the size of the positive impacts generated relative to the costs, green infrastructure is perhaps the easiest and most efficient initiative we can make to help make our cities sustainable,” the study read.
The study’s authors described their findings as “substantial,” though they noted just two roofs were monitored.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/24/energy-storage-appears-to-be-fully-charged-for-exponential-growth/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 24, 2021",Energy storage appears to be fully charged for exponential growth,"From pv magazine USA
Lithium-based energy storage volumes deployed to the United States will grow by multiple orders of magnitude in the coming years, with a 1000% capacity increase over the next two years projected in a recent government report. That rate of growth may well be an underestimate, given current market trends.
The U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration released the third edition of its U.S. Battery Storage Market Trends report, covering a mix of energy storage information from the end of 2019, and 2020, with projections through 2023.
The EIA noted that as of the end of 2020, 74% of the nation’s slightly more than 1 GW/1.8 GWh of energy storage was deployed in five states. California contributed 31% of that total. Texas, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Hawaii accounted for more than 50 MW of capacity each. The report predicted a rapidly growing, evolving market as a result of consecutive reductions in future pricing.
As of the end of 2019, it was clear that market location was driving energy storage installation techniques.
In PJM territory, batteries are most often used for ancillary services, so installations tended to be “power oriented,” delivering a higher instantaneous power output for a shorter duration. Installations in the power grid region had an average power capacity of 10.8 MW, and an average energy capacity of 6.8 MWh, meaning an average duration of 45 minutes.
In California, batteries were being used primarily for stability. The state’s batteries had an average power capacity of 4.7 MW, and an average energy capacity of 14.4 MWh, making for an average duration of just over 3.0 hours.
The longer hour pattern has continued in California, with a recent announcement noting that 2 GW of energy storage power capacity was due online by the end of August. Most of that will be coupled to 4 hours of energy capacity.
Going forward, the volumes are growing with at least a 1,000% capacity growth over 2019 numbers expected.
Project developers had reported to the EIA that they planned to install over 10 GW of large-scale battery storage power capacity between 2021 and 2023. While the EIA doesn’t publish forward-looking energy capacity volumes due to privacy requests by developers, WoodMac Renewables & Power has suggested that around 12 GWh of capacity is on track to be installed in 2021.
The report noted that California accounts for 40% of power capacity planned between 2021 and 2023. These planned additions put California in line to meet its energy storage requirement by 2024.
California will already have 2 GW of energy storage power online by the end of August. Given the state’s power grid challenges, expectations are that the state’s storage capacity will continue to grow very aggressively, blowing past their legal requirements.
The EIA report also said that greater than 70% of the energy storage to be deployed is slated to be coupled with solar power. This would increase the current volume co-located with electricity generation from 30% to 60%.
Current tax law makes it so that coupling solar power and energy storage gets a 26% tax credit and accelerated depreciation (roughly another 17% of project costs) applied to the energy storage if the solar power is used to charge the batteries.
Industry has been pushing for its own energy storage tax credit that would decouple the solar+storage relationship, at least financially. Recent reporting by the National Renewable Energy Lab shows that coupling storage with a standard solar installation produces only modest price savings, if any.

NTPC Ltd, India’s largest integrated energy company, has commissioned a 25 MW floating solar project on the reservoir of its Simhadri thermal power station, in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.
The plant, built with more than 1 lakh (100,000) of solar modules, spans 75 acres on the water surface and uses a unique anchoring design for the panels.
The floating project is expected to generate enough electricity to light around 7,000 households and to offset at least 46,000 tons of CO2 during its lifetime. It could also prevent 1,364 million litres of water evaporating annually – enough to meet the yearly requirement of 6,700 households.
NTPC has 66.9 GW of power generation capacity across 71 power stations, including 29 renewable energy projects. The group says it also has more than 17 GW of power plant capacity under construction, including 5 GW of renewables. NTPC is aiming to install 60 GW of renewables capacity by 2032.
