By providing businesses with an overview of the true state of their current energy impact, the company says it’s developed a springboard to help businesses to engage with greener alternatives. “You can’t measure or model what you can’t track,”  WePower’s Chief Customer Officer Huda Olsson told pv magazine Australia.
The enterprise-facing platform is designed to inform, guide and report on corporates’ sustainability strategies by providing an interface to track green energy use while also allowing users to contract additional renewably-sourced power.
Olsson said the company chose to launch the platform in Australia first since it’s a leader “in terms of companies wanting to green.”
While the platform is only visible to the companies using it, the blockchain-based system means the data can be easily shared and transparently certified by auditors, customers or other interested parties, should the company choose.
The blockchain technology, Olsson added, also enables complex bilateral and trilateral commercial engagements to be easily accounted for, making accurate oversight possible.
WePower’s software basically integrates directly with data from users’ smart meters. This gives the company access to live and dynamic data which is then translated onto the Incite dashboard, effectively tracking what portion of operation’s energy was renewably sourced 24/7.
This allows for far more granularity, especially compared to the analogue method of bill validation. “WePower is actually taking it straight from the source,” Olsson said.
The company then uses this data to model and forecast the operation’s consumption, helping them calculate how much additional renewable energy is still to be sourced to meet targets.
This additional renewable energy can then be contract directly through Incite. “It’s a real end to end system,” Olsson said.
Olsson describes the days of companies being able to simply use a power purchasing agreement (PPA) as proof of sustainability as “gone”. With increasing scrutiny is being placed on corporates making sustainability pledges and setting renewable energy targets, companies need transparent sustainability reporting methods to prove their words have translated into actions and are more than just greenwashing.
“With the launch of Incite we’re enabling businesses to put substance behind their sustainability pledges by helping them to know precisely where they are on that journey and where they need to invest to improve. It’s only by having this complete picture that realistic KPIs can be set and genuine sustainability progress can be made,” WePower’s Chief Technical Officer, Kaspar Kaarlep, said.
Through the platform, it’s also possible for businesses to map, integrate and ultimately verify their supply chains, though this would require the supplier businesses to also use the software.
The platform has five different “modules” (the name WePower has given for levels of services), which begin with a tracking dashboard and advance to the more sophisticated feature of being able to “tokenise” company’s individual assets or products based on how much green energy was used in its creation.
For a fashion brand, for example, Olsson says the platform could track how much electricity was used to make 100 shirts, and how much green electricity the company purchased over that period, enabling it to issue a token verifying the individual garment had been made using 100% renewable energy.
As Olsson put it, the feature means companies can show and prove their green coverage based on 24/7 green matching. Since the platform takes its data directly from the smart meter to its platform, that token can be viewed by auditors on the blockchain through a report.
Like most software as a service enterprises, WePower charges users a connection or setup fee as well as a monthly fee.
Exactly how expensive the ‘Incite’ suite is depends how many of WePower’s five “modules” (services level) a business wants to access. It is also dependent on the business’ size and how many enterprises it’s looking to connect. As a rough ballpark, Olsson said plans start at around $50,000.
WePower has opted to first launch the Incite product suite here in Australia, where it also has a research and development team. It plans to take the package overseas shortly to countries it deems to have the most opportunity.
To this end, Olsson described the platform for “regulation agnostic,” allowing it to be integrated to a range of different countries’ systems.
While it is too early for secured customers, Olsson said WePower is already in discussions with companies from the transport, fashion, beauty, and aluminium manufacturing industries.

Multicom Resources’ Saint Elmo mine, as its named, will be located near Julia Creek, in the state’s North West.
Construction on the $250 million mine is planned to start in 2022, with first production forecast for late 2023.

“Saint Elmo is initially forecast to produce up to 5,000 tonnes per annum of vanadium pentoxide, supporting at least 150 mine jobs and operating for up to 20 years,” Multicom Resources’ CEO Shaun McCarthy said in a statement. Over time, the project will expand production to 20,000 tonnes per annum, he added.
Vanadium is used in high strength low alloy steel and is emerging as a critical battery storage commodity for its use in vanadium redox flow batteries, ideally suited to large, grid scale storage solutions, the government’s statement read. While flow batteries are growing in popularity for being safer and more durable compared to lithium-ion chemistries, vanadium’s toxicity has seen the chemistry criticised at times.
Queensland’s potential vanadium hub
Saint Elmo is the first mine approved in a potential vanadium hub in the far north-west, with other companies progressing other potential mines.
Plans for vanadium mines are also progressing elsewhere in Australia, though at the moment there are only a handful of vanadium mines operating in a select few global locations including China, Brazil and South Africa.
Multicom Resources
The Saint Elmo project was declared a ‘prescribed project’ in February last year, giving Queensland’s Coordinator-General the ability streamline approvals and fast-track delivery of the project.
“I congratulate Multicom as the first cab off the rank in an exciting new era for Queensland’s resources sector, and a massive boost to our Covid-19 Economic Recovery Plan,” Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said.
“Vanadium is a new economy mineral that will fuel Queensland’s future as a global resources supplier for decades to come,” she added. “This also lays the foundation for a potential next level new industry in Queensland manufacturing vanadium redox flow batteries.”

Under the order, Hyzon is obligated to deliver the trucks to Ark Energy by the end of 2022. Moreover, Hyzon expects to assemble the trucks here in Australia, saying this would align with its “plans to boost local Australian production of fuel cell vehicles.”
The project is expected to be the first in the world to use Hyzon’s 154-tonne hydrogen trucks.
Ark Energy will lease the trucks to its sister company, Townsville Logistics, which will deploy them in triple (three-trailer) road-train configurations as part of their short-haul fleet, operating on a 30km loop from the Port of Townsville to the Sun Metals zinc refinery owned by the group, Hyzon said.
The trucks will be fuelled by Ark Energy’s own hydrogen refilling station SunHQ Hydrogen Hub which is at the site of Sun Metals’ zinc refinery. The green hydrogen will produced via an electrolyser powered by its 124 MW co-located solar farm.
While Hyzon is headquartered in the United States, its CEO and co-founder, Craig Knight, is Australian and has been paying attention to the oft-overlooked Australian market for fuel cell technology.
The company claims to be the world’s only supplier of ultra-heavy-duty hydrogen trucks with in-house fuel cell technologies. It is certainly the only company supplying this class of vehicle in Australia in the next 18 months.
“Hyzon is the only hydrogen commercial mobility company that can meet our needs,” Ark Energy CEO Daniel Kim said in a statement. “Our fuel cell trucks need to be 154-tonne rated, built to Australian Design Rules and delivered by the end of next year. That was the ultimate basis for placing this order.”
In July, when the order was first announced though not confirmed, Kim said Hyzon Motors was the only original equipment manufacturer (OEM) interested in supplying the Australian market in the next 18 months.
“Hyzon is committed to developing its next-generation 370 kW fuel cell systems (equivalent to 500 horsepower); this project will help advance the growing market for this application in Australia’s ultra-heavy transport sector as well as other adjacent industries including the mining, rail and marine sectors,” Hyzon added in its statement.
While Hyzon has the heavy-truck class covered, Australian startup H2X is targeting the lighter class of transport vehicles over the next two years.
Earlier this month, Ark Energy signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Port of Townsville to complete a feasibility study into its plan of exporting 200,000 tonnes a year of Queensland-made renewable hydrogen to South Korea.
While it is currently testing out its producing capability servicing the new fleet of trucks with green hydrogen needs from SunHQ, the ultimate goal, Kim has said, is to produce enough to green hydrogen to export to the company’s main base of South Korea.
Korea Zinc, the owners of Sun Metals and Ark Energy is currently Queensland’s second largest single-site energy consumer. In November of 2020, it pledged to power its entire operations with 100% renewable electricity by 2040, with an interim target of 80% by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/15/theres-no-decarbonisation-without-data/,"BLOCKCHAIN,OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2021",There’s no decarbonisation without data,"The IPCC report released in August is the latest wake up-call to Australia that it must lift its weight to prevent the looming climate catastrophe. The report concludes that permanent climate change is closer than previously thought, with temperatures expected to rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2030, unless urgent action is taken.
The action we must take is clear, and the tools we need are at hand. Decarbonisation demands grid improvements, measurable corporate sustainability transformations and the collective will of energy consumers. The common prerequisite in each of these elements is the sophisticated use of energy data.
At a network level, we must modernise our grid so that it’s fit for purpose in a 100% renewables future. This means it must be able to manage distributed, fluctuating generation loads from both behind and in front of the meter, and must be able to balance those loads using batteries at both a grid scale and a household scale.
Network operators must have technology that provides a dynamic and granular picture of demands and inputs. In addition to physical infrastructure improvements, we must implement technology that provides minute-by-minute visibility, allowing network operators to predict and respond to momentary changes within the grid.
An unfortunate situation arises as the priorities of securing the network are at odds with the interests of solar powered households, resulting in a “sun tax” that charges households to feed energy into the grid. The costs are a necessity to grid maintenance but also a disincentive for renewable behind-the-meter generation. Ultimately, the energy transition suffers.
A responsive, dynamic, and detailed grid digitisation project can move us past the policies that slow our decarbonisation and toward a future where we are a renewable energy superpower and high carbon-emitting energy sources are obsolete. 
Data is also a crucial precondition to the decarbonisation at a company and sector level. Effective change is impossible without accurate measurements. Corporate energy users who have made commitments to be 100% renewable to their investors, boards, staff, and customers must make that commitment an operation rather than an aspiration.
This requires a new approach to energy use and procurement. With sustainability commitments under increasingly intense scrutiny, corporate energy users must implement technology that monitors their use against their spend in real time. They must be able to show their stakeholders where their energy is coming from, how it is being used, and what measures they are taking to ensure this is in line with their sustainability pathways in real time.
The technology they use must be understandable, robustly reliable, and transparent to all parties. Public blockchain technology, which can create a trusted, unalterable, and transparent ledger of transactions and usage, is best practice in this emerging area.
Finally at a household level we must empower energy consumers to use their smart meter data to make informed decisions about their energy purchases—whether they have solar panels and batteries or not.
The long-awaited consumer data right for energy users is currently under industry consultation from the Federal Treasury. This will let consumers choose who they share their data with, and for what purposes. Properly implemented, this should let energy retailers and consumers work together to hasten the shift to renewable energy by leveraging the combined demand of millions of householders.
Energy retailers who want to take advantage of this consumer demand can use smart contracts to construct virtual PPAs based on the projected demand of many thousands of energy users. This can provide householders with certainty that their energy spend is going to renewable generation projects. It can even let users choose to support a specific generation project—for example, one that is creating local jobs in their area—with their power bills.
This aggregate demand will drive the installation of further renewable generation capacity as generators respond to newly visible demands and preferences made clear through the ability of consumers to share data. To be clear, the networks must themselves be modernised to accommodate for this increase in renewable generation sources.
At every level in our energy industry, from the individual household and corporate customers, to the network operators and regulators, data is the key to energy transformation. If we use the technology that is available, everyone can play their role in the rapid decarbonisation of the energy sector. If we choose to stall and maintain the status quo the consequences are clear to all of us.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/15/cylindrical-solar-panel-for-street-lighting/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ITALY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2021",Cylindrical solar panel for street lighting,"From pv magazine Global
Italian start-up Fly Solartech Solutions Srl has developed a lightweight cylindrical solar panel that can be integrated onto PV-powered street lighting lamp posts of different sizes. 
The Fly Solartech module is encapsulated in thermoformable plastic technical polymers and relies on a white backsheet. It is available in three versions with a power output of 100, 120, and 240 W.
The most powerful device measures 180 x345 x3.10mm and weighs in at 5 kg. It is built with 84 half-cut monocrystalline cells with an efficiency of 23.4% and has an open-circuit voltage of 12.78 V for each string. The overall efficiency of the 240 W panel is 17.3% and its temperature coefficient is -0.32%.
“The product is divided into two halves which are assembled together to embrace the post,” the company’s CEO, Davide Zanatta, told pv magazine. “Each half is composed of two strings of cells that are not interconnected with each other but each with its own junction box.” This configuration allows deploying more cylindrical modules around the same post and connecting them in series and maximizing their output through multi-channel maximum power point tracking (MPPT).
“The thermoformable technical polymers allow shaping the product in its cylindrical shape without incurring internal micro-cracking and maintaining the range of curvature that the cells themselves are is able to absorb,” Zanatta further explained.
The product has a diameter of almost 35 cm including the fixing structures and can be applied on any commercial post with a diameter ranging from 10 to 25 cm. This, according to the manufacturer, also allows for excellent ventilation between the interspace created between the panel and the pole, triggering a natural chimney effect that induces a continuous airflow between the backsheet and the post vertically.
Each cylinder is incorporated in two aluminium fixing collars placed on the external ends of the panel and two lateral guides that allow the perfect closure of the two halves. “Its cylindrical nature allows it to withstand strong winds as well as its vertical application allows limiting to a minimum the deposits of dirt and sand as well as snow accumulation,” Zannatta emphasised.
The product can also be made with an anti-glare protective coating to allow its application on roads and highways where the use of an anti-reflection product is necessary. “The is also easily applicable as a retrofit solution, as it is possible to install the junction box between panel and pole by means of special brackets,” Zanatta concluded.
The product comes with a 10-year product warranty and 20-year performance guarantee.
When asked about the general skepticism around cylindrical PV panels after the bankruptcy of US manufacturer Solyndra in 2011, Zanatta said since then almost everything had changed in the solar market. “One of the weak points of Solyndra was that the panel efficiency was rated at 10-12% and this product was competing on a roof solar market that had better economic and technical options,” he stated. “Our product, instead, is using the latest technologies in terms of efficiency and manufacturing process and it is targeted to fill a very specific demand of the solar market for public lighting, which means the need for panels that do not visually disfigure the environment, that minimises the need for cleaning them and most important of all that they can be used as a retrofit on poles already installed.”
The panels that are now used for public lighting applications are basically standard panels installed on the pole head, he added. This does not allow them to be installed on existing poles because they need lamps and poles that allow them to be housed at the top of the pole. Moreover, they have higher cleaning costs, and being in a horizontal position tens of meters high, they become easy support for birds and their excretions as they are covered by snow during winter.
Fly Solartech Solutions Srl is based in San Daniele del Friuli, in the northern Italian region of Friuli Venezia-Giulia. It currently owns and operates a 40 MW factory in Tolmezzo, in the same region. “Our plan is to expand the capacity to 100 MW over the next three years,” Zanatta added. The company also develops flexible and lightweight photovoltaic panels, which can be integrated into building envelopes but also in automotive, marine, public lighting, and military applications.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/15/australia-branded-a-laggard-as-new-report-reveals-china-holds-key-to-cancelling-global-coal-projects/,"POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,WORLD",MAX HALL,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2021",Australia branded a laggard as new report reveals China holds key to cancelling global coal projects,"From pv magazine Global
With 84 of the world’s governments having either committed not to permit new coal plants or not having any plans for such facilities, the central role China and five other nations can play in consigning global coal use to history has been revealed in a new report.
The No New Coal by 2021, The Collapse of the Global Coal Pipeline study published today by three environmental thinktanks and lobbyists, has garnered plenty of media attention with its claim there has been a 76% reduction in plans for new coal-fired generation facilities since the Paris climate agreement was signed in 2015.
The report, compiled by staff from London-based climate thinktank E3G, cross-city peer and lobby group Ember, and San Francisco-based fossil fuel plant tracker Global Energy Monitor, stated China is home to 55% of the world pipeline for new coal facilities and, together with India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Turkey, and Bangladesh, jointly accounts for 82% of plans for new coal plants.
With the report’s authors claiming Chinese lenders are behind 76% of Africa’s new-coal pipeline, as part of more than 40 GW of coal-fired generation capacity state bodies are financing across 20 nations, the nation is described as “the last remaining major provider of public finance for overseas coal projects.”
On the credit side of the Chinese climate account, the report noted, the nation has cancelled 484 GW of coal plants since Paris, resulting in a 74% retreat in approvals for new coal facilities.
U.K. cabinet minister Alok Sharma has called on policymakers to make history at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November by ending coal-fired generation – although his message has been undermined by the fact colleague Robert Jenrick is due to assess the merits of proposals for a coking coal mine in Cumbria, northwest England.
The global new-coal report has highlighted 16 nations which have plans for just one new coal plant apiece, and who can, therefore, add to the momentum by deciding to phase out the fossil fuel, with Africa supplying nine countries: Ethiopia, Niger, Morocco, Madagascar, Djibouti, Eswatini, Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya, and Tanzania. The Asian nations of Uzbekistan, Thailand and Cambodia are also on the list, along with Australia and Papua New Guinea, Mexico, and Poland.
However, with five of those countries – Australia, Mexico, Poland, Thailand, and Cambodia – listed among 14 global “laggards” highlighted by the report, there appears to be more lobbying to be done. Elsewhere, the study criticised a lack of progress in Colombia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Brazil, Mongolia, Laos, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique.
Some 19 nations were described as “leaders” in the movement to phase out coal, including a rare bit of good PR for the generals in charge of Myanmar, whose regime sits alongside the U.K., Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, Greece, Egypt, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Malaysia, Brunei, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Senegal, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Ghana, and Namibia.
