Solar Citizens national director Ellen Roberts warned the controversial solar exports rule has the potential to fragment the National Electricity Market (NEM).
“Allowing network companies to charge solar owners for exporting their clean energy is a big call and we have not been presented with anywhere near enough evidence to show that it’s required,” she said.
“States like Queensland and Victoria have signalled they don’t support export charging, so if this rule change goes ahead, we’re likely to see a piecemeal and messy application across the National Electricity Market.
“There are, however, some really important parts to the AEMC’s proposal.”
Roberts said those who signed the joint submission support it being formally recognised that networks provide an export service, and the need for increased transparency around when static zero export limits are being imposed on solar customers.
“We need to make sure that network companies are embracing solar exports and exploring all options for increasing the grid’s hosting capacity,” she said.
More than 2.6 million Australian homes and businesses have already installed rooftop solar, and in the next decade another 3 million are expected to join them.
The AEMC has indicated the rapid uptake of solar PV in Australia is already triggering ‘traffic jams’ on the network and warned they will get worse as more solar connects because the grid infrastructure was built when power only flowed one way.
In its draft determination released in March, Australia’s energy rule maker outlined a series of proposals designed to prepare for a future where rooftop solar and batteries dominate the nation’s power system.
The most controversial of those proposals is a two-way pricing mechanism which would give networks pricing options to reward solar and battery owners for exporting to the grid during peak demand periods. They would also have the option to charge customers for sending their electricity during the middle of the day.
The AMEC has stated the proposal does not mandate default charges for exporting power.

The draft proposal does however give networks the ability to develop new pricing structures which the AEMC said could be very different depending on the capacity of each different network and how much solar demand there is in that area.
“This is about creating tailored options, not blanket solutions,” AEMC chief executive Benn Barr said.
“We want to open the solar gateway so more Australians can join the 2.6 million small solar owners who have already led the way. But it’s important to do this fairly. We want to avoid a first-come, best-dressed system because that limits the capacity for more solar into the grid.
“Within 10 years, half of all energy users will be using home energy options like solar. We must make sure this seismic shift doesn’t leave anyone behind because every Australian, whether they have solar or not, deserves an affordable, sustainable power system.”
AEMC modelling suggests that if networks did introduce export charges, 80% of customers would see their bills drop because they would no longer pay for solar export services they weren’t using.
The AEMC said the 20% of customers with solar could expect to see a of export charge impacts, depending on system size. A 4−6kW system would still earn on average $900 – about $70 less than now. But this impact could look very different if they took up options that rewarded them for using the system differently – such as self-consuming power.
Despite the AEMC’s optimism, Dan Cass, who as Energy Regulatory Lead at The Australia Institute was among those to sign the joint submission, said the proposed rule change has the potential to undermine Australia’s transition to renewable energy.
“The growth of rooftop solar has been the most constant national success story in energy and climate in Australia,” he said. “This rule change will undermine that progress and put in place a messy regime that might not even be implemented uniformly across states.
“There is a huge amount of value in household PV, batteries, electric vehicles, demand response and other distributed energy resources. What is needed now is a clear roadmap from the Energy Security Board for DER integration and economic regulation.”
The submission calls for trials of clean technology to be expedited and used to inform market design work.
“Inverters with dynamic operating envelope capabilities, smart electric vehicle chargers and community batteries are smarter solutions to DER integration than export charges,” it states.
Submissions to the AEMC have now closed. More than 1,300 submissions opposing the introduction of export charging were lodged.
The AEMC is expected to make the final determination in July.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/04/hybrid-systems-unveils-worlds-biggest-sps-factory-as-it-targets-growing-market/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 4, 2021",Hybrid Systems unveils ‘world’s biggest’ SPS factory as it targets growing market,"With the Western Australian Government committed to rolling out more standalone power systems (SPS) across the state, Pacific Energy subsidiary Hybrid Systems Australia has confirmed it will build a 16,000 square metre production facility in Perth dedicated to the design and construction of the off-grid and edge-of-grid systems.
A subsidiary of QIC-owned Pacific Energy, Hybrid Systems has taken an initial 10-year lease at the Perth Airport industrial precinct where the purpose-built facility will be located.
Hybrid Systems said the new facility will allow it to increase production capacity and to service growing demand for SPS.
The driving force behind the increasing demand is state-owned power utility Western Power which provides SPS, combining solar PV, battery storage, an inverter and a back-up generator, to customers in regional and remote locations to improve power reliability and quality as well as provide cost efficiencies.
In February the Western Australian (WA) Government announced $218 million had been set aside to manufacture and install more than 1,000 SPS in regional WA over the next five years.
Pacific Energy chief executive officer Jamie Cullen said modelling conducted by Western Power showed about 6,000 viable properties in Western Australia (WA) where SPS units could be installed in coming years.
“This investment is a recognition that increasing energy decentralisation and decarbonisation pressures are going to drive demand for clean energy sources such as SPS and the bigger grid-connected battery energy storage systems (BESS),” he said.
“This is the biggest SPS manufacturing facility in the world as far as we are aware.”
Boundary Power
Cullen said the technology is also ideally suited to Queensland with Hybrid Systems estimating future demand in the state of about 2,000 SPS.
“As another big state, Queensland has the same issues as WA in terms of getting reliable power to remote customers at the edge of long power grids and the same consumer demand for renewable solutions,” he said.
The unveiling of the new production facility is timely with the WA Government announcing on Thursday it will install 35 more SPS as residents in the state’s Mid-West continue to grapple with the damage wrought by Cyclone Seroja.
Cyclone Seroja tore a path of destruction through the Mid-West more than eight weeks ago, with Western Power’s transmission network among the infrastructure damaged.
“The extra 35 Standalone Power Systems will be located in Latham, Yuna and Nangetty and will be a welcome solution for regional customers who are often impacted by weather events,” Energy Minister Bill Johnston said.
Since 2016, Western Power has installed 58 SPS in WA and Johnstone said the technology had demonstrated its dependability during the recent cyclone.
“A great example of the technology’s resilience is that six SPS customers in the Mullewa region retained power during the destructive cyclone on April 11,” he said.

Western Power CEO Ed Kalajzic said the power utility would continue to roll out SPS in a bid to improve power reliability in regional and remote areas.
“Like many electricity networks around the world, Western Power is looking at ways we can improve power reliability and quality and improve operational and cost efficiencies for the community,” he said.
“We’re increasingly using renewables and SPS provides a viable alternative to traditional poles and wires while realising commercial, social, and environmental benefits.
“Our modelling shows that through installing thousands of SPS over the coming decades we could avoid millions of dollars in traditional network build, deliver customer benefits and facilitate sustainable energy.”
Renewable energy developer and service provider BayWA r.e. Solar Systems will deliver 10 of the new units while Hybrid Systems will deliver 25.
Hybrid Systems has also been awarded a further allocation of 60 units with Western Power confirming that in addition to the post-cyclone approved SPS, another 98 units will be installed across regional WA over the next 12 to 18 months.
Hybrid Systems said work on its new manufacturing facility has already commenced and is due to be completed this year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/04/green-steel-is-hailed-as-the-next-big-thing-in-australian-industry-heres-what-the-hype-is-all-about/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JUNE 4, 2021",‘Green steel’ is hailed as the next big thing in Australian industry. Here’s what the hype is all about,"From The Conversation
Steel is a major building block of our modern world, used to make everything from cutlery to bridges and wind turbines. But the way it’s made – using coal – is making climate change worse.
On average, almost two tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) are emitted for every tonne of steel produced. This accounts for about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Cleaning up steel production is clearly key to Earth’s low-carbon future.
Fortunately, a new path is emerging. So-called “green steel”, made using hydrogen rather than coal, represents a huge opportunity for Australia. It would boost our exports, help offset inevitable job losses in the fossil fuel industry and go a long way to tackling climate change.
Australia’s abundant and cheap wind and solar resources mean we’re well placed to produce the hydrogen a green steel industry needs. So let’s take a look at how green steel is made, and the challenges ahead.
Steel-making requires stripping oxygen from iron ore to produce pure iron metal. In traditional steel-making, this is done using coal or natural gas in a process that releases CO₂. In green steel production, hydrogen made from renewable energy replaces fossil fuels.
Australia exports almost 900 million tonnes of iron ore each year, but only makes 5.5 million tonnes of steel. This means we have great capacity to ramp up steel production.
A Grattan Institute report last year found if Australia captured about 6.5% of the global steel market, this could generate about A$65 billion in annual export revenue and create 25,000 manufacturing jobs in Queensland and New South Wales.
Steel-making is a complex process and is primarily achieved via one of three processes. Each of them, in theory, can be adapted to produce green steel. We examine each process below.
Globally, about 70% of steel is produced using the blast furnace method.
As part of this process, processed coal (also known as coke) is used in the main body of the furnace. It acts as a physical support structure for materials entering and leaving the furnace, among other functions. It’s also partially burnt at the bottom of the furnace to both produce heat and make carbon monoxide, which strips oxygen from iron ore leaving metallic iron.
This coal-driven process leads to CO₂ emissions. It’s feasible to replace a portion of the carbon monoxide with hydrogen. The hydrogen can strip oxygen away from the ore, generating water instead of CO₂. This requires renewable electricity to produce green hydrogen.
And hydrogen cannot replace carbon monoxide at a ratio of 1:1. If hydrogen is used, the blast furnace needs more externally added heat to keep the temperature high, compared with the coal method.
More importantly, solid coal in the main body of the furnace cannot be replaced with hydrogen. Some alternatives have been developed, involving biomass – a fuel developed from living organisms – blended with coal.
But sourcing biomass sustainably and at scale would be a challenge. And this process would still likely create some fossil-fuel derived emissions. So to ensure the process is “green”, these emissions would have to be captured and stored – a technology which is currently expensive and unproven at scale.
Around 30% of the world’s steel is made from recycled steel. Steel has one of the highest recycling rates of any material.
Steel recycling is mainly done in arc furnaces, driven by electricity. Each tonne of steel produced using this method produces about 0.4 tonnes of CO₂ – mostly due to emissions produced by burning fossil fuels for electricity generation. If the electricity was produced from renewable sources, the CO₂ output would be greatly reduced.
But steel cannot continuously be recycled. After a while, unwanted elements such as copper, nickel and tin begin to accumulate in the steel, reducing its quality. Also, steel has a long lifetime and low turnover rate. This means recycled steel cannot meet all steel demand, and some new steel must be produced.
“Direct reduced iron” (DRI) technology often uses methane gas to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which are then used to turn iron ore into iron. This method still creates CO₂ emissions, and requires more electricity than the blast furnace method. However its overall emission intensity can be substantially lower.
The method currently accounts for less than 5% of production, and offers the greatest opportunity for using green hydrogen.
Up to 70% of the hydrogen derived from methane could be replaced with green hydrogen without having to modify the production process too much. However work on using 100% green hydrogen in this method is ongoing.
The green steel transition won’t happen overnight and significant challenges remain.
Cheap, large-scale green hydrogen and renewable electricity will be required. And even if green hydrogen is used, to achieve net-zero emissions the blast furnace method will still require carbon-capture and storage technologies – and so too will DRI, for the time being.
Private sector investment is needed to create a global-scale export industry. Australian governments also have a big role to play, in building skills and capability, helping workers retrain, funding research and coordinating land-use planning.
Revolutionising Australia’s steel industry is a daunting task. But if we play our cards right, Australia can be a major player in the green manufacturing revolution.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/04/reclaim-pv-adds-queensland-site-to-solar-module-recycling-plans/,"SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 4, 2021",Reclaim PV adds Queensland site to solar module recycling plans,"Adelaide-based Reclaim PV Recycling is set to expand its solar PV module recycling operation to a second facility in Queensland after receiving development approval and an environmental permit from local and state governments to establish a new facility in Brisbane.
Reclaim PV said the Brisbane facility will complement its foundation site in the in the Adelaide industrial suburb of Londsdale, which is expected to commence operations next month with about 70,000 panels to be recycled each year. The Brisbane facility is expected to come online later this year.
Reclaim PV director Clive Fleming said the company also has plans to establish facilities in other major metropolitan areas in the next one to two years, declaring a national recovery and recycling network is an absolute necessity for the PV industry in Australia.
“Securing this second DA marks another significant milestone for Reclaim PV in the establishment of Australia’s first national solar panel recovery and recycling network,” he said.
“Australia’s rooftop solar installations are the highest in the world (on a per-capita basis), with approximately 60 million or 21.4 GW installed so far (as of March 31, 2021) and research is suggesting that there will be more than 1 million panels requiring replacement annually by 2031.
“We need a nation-wide approach to managing the replacement and recycling of faulty, non-performing and end-of-life solar panels before this gets unmanageable and we start to see 2,000 tonnes of waste making its way to landfill annually.”
While solar modules are designed to last, with an average life span of 25 years, eventually they are going to need replacing and predictions suggest managing end-of-life or broken panels will be a sizeable challenge.
A 2016 study jointly prepared by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that 78 million tonnes of raw materials with a combined value of US$15 billion could be recovered from solar panels globally by 2050.

In Australia, researchers from the University of South Australia (UniSA) have estimated that more than 100,000 tonnes of solar modules will enter the waste stream by 2035.
Fleming said it is imperative end-of-life strategies are put in place long before solar waste peaks.
“Reclaim PV is committed to providing an end-to-end solution to meet this challenge and to engage with industry, commercial users of solar panels and all levels of government to introduce sustainable recovery and recycling practices across the whole supply chain to support the circular economy,” he said.
Reclaim PV, which for the past few years has been processing a test trickle of around 10,000 modules per annum, is looking to work with manufacturers, councils and businesses to establish a national network of drop-off locations for solar modules to be recycled at its plants.
“Our vision is for Reclaim PV to be the catalyst to bring government, businesses and consumers together in this relatively young industry to both create and accelerate the end-to-end recovery and recycling of solar panels,” Fleming said.
Reclaim PV’s expansion plans are part of an increase of activity in the solar module recycling sector.
Lithgow City Council in New South Wales announced this week that it had introduced a solar module recycling operation at its Lithgow Solid Waste Facility.
“Solar Panels are primarily made up of glass, plastic and aluminium and this service will allow all parts to be recycled effectively diverting this problem waste from our landfill,” council said in a statement.
“Waste generated from used solar panels is an emerging issue and Council is pleased to offer this service at a time when limited options are available.”
Victorian-based Lotus Energy has also commenced recycling operations at its facility in Melbourne’s north.
Lotus Energy unveiled its panel-crushing plant late last month, declaring it is capable of recycling 100% of end-of-life solar modules, including inverters, cables, optimisers and mounting structures – all without using any chemicals.
Another Melbourne-based company, Elecsome, last year secured a federal government grant to establish a solar panel upcycling plant in partnership with industrial manufacturing company Ojas Group in partnership with RMIT and the University of Melbourne.

The news comes hot on the heels of BP’s announcement earlier this week that it will pay US$220 million for 9 GW of solar development projects in the U.S. from Texas-based 7X Energy. pv magazine USA reports that the assets will be developed through Lightsource bp across 12 states and expect to generate returns of at least 8-10%. The deal pushes BP toward its renewable capacity target of 20 GW by 2025 and 50 GW by 2030. 
The AUD$330 million finance package secured from EDC, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo and Westpac, means PCL Constructors Pacific Rim can begin construction on the two solar farms immediately, and speaks to the strength of green finance in what is still a volatile economic period. 
Lightsource bp says the two projects bring the company’s under construction Australian capacity to over 500 MW (DC), and its overall Australian pipeline to 1.5 GW (DC), no doubt inclusive of its 400 MW (DC) Wellington North Solar Farm, which received approval last month from the NSW Department of Planning and Environment as part the developer’s 600 MW (DC) Wellington Solar Hub in central western NSW. 
“Although Covid-19 has disrupted the energy landscape,” said Lightsource bp Australia country manager, Adam Pegg, “we are proud to be able to start construction and complete the financing of two large solar projects on a subsidy-free basis, demonstrating the resilience of solar as a sustainable solution to meeting the rising global energy demands.” 
The two projects, which are expected to be in commercial operation by mid-2022, will be able to generate around 673 GWh of solar energy annually, enough to power approximately 100,000 Australian homes and save the emissions of 225,000 non-electric cars. 
Good policy, big pipeline 
Lightsource bp and its investors pointed to supportive policies from both the QLD and NSW governments for making these projects possible. QLD’s 50% renewable energy by 2030 ambition and NSW’s 12 GW in ten years pledge were singled out in a Lightsource bp statement for unleashing “a great deal of private investment opportunities in Australia’s renewables sector.” 
Westpac Institutional Bank CEO, Anthony Miller, said “It is fantastic to support Lightsource bp in these two large scale solar projects in NSW and QLD. Solar will play a significant role in Australia’s energy transition and Westpac is looking forward to working with Lightsource bp in the pursuit of that goal.”
Snowy Hydro has already signed a 15-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the West Wyalong Solar Farm, which will see two-thirds of the project’s energy used to supply 88 NSW service stations with 23,000 MWh of clean energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/04/nano-micro-scale-cooler-for-solar-modules/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GREECE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 4, 2021",Nano-micro-scale cooler for solar modules,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists from the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH) in Greece have developed a solar module cooling technique based on radiative cooling and micro-scale patterning.
Radiative cooling occurs when the surface of an object absorbs less radiation from its environment and less than the energy it radiates. When this happens, the surface loses heat to the outer space and a cooling effect can be achieved without the need for power.
Presented in the study Combined nano and micro structuring for enhanced radiative cooling and efficiency of photovoltaic cells, published in scientific reports, the novel system consists of a thin glass radiative cooler designed in nano- and micro-scaled periodic patterns. This device, according to the researchers, can be placed on top of a solar cell to reduce its operating temperature and, at the same time, achieve high optical transparency and high thermal emission.
The coating is based on a two-dimensional subwavelength nanostructured grating, which is imprinted in soda-lime glass and has enhanced mid-infrared emissivity, and a micro-structured grating. “The microscale patterning enhances cooler’s performance in the atmospheric transparency window while the nanopatterning further enhances the optical radiation absorption,” the academics explained. “The combined enhancement is possible because the emissivity enhancement provided by the micro-grating in the thermal wavelengths is not affected by the nano-grating and vice versa.”
The two gratings can be manufactured through laser-induced structuring. “Due to the nature of laser-processing technology, the patterned surfaces can be easily scaled up to large areas that could be used to enhance the light-harvesting in solar cells,” the research team emphasised, adding that the gratings can be realised not only as binary devices but also with appropriate structures of different shapes.
A silicon nitride (Si3N4) anti-reflective coating was also placed on top of the wafer to increase absorptivity. “When we place the nano-micro-grating coating on top of this structure, it results in a higher Si solar absorption of around 0.92%,” the academics further explained. This was achieved, according to them, without increasing the complexity of the cell design.
When the thin radiative cooling coating was placed on top of a silicon wafer, sunlight absorption in silicon increased by around 25.4%. “Temperature reduction and efficiency enhancement was also achieved when we applied the proposed cooler in realistic Si-based solar cells,” the Greek team added.  The temperature decrease provided by the nano-micro-grating coating compared to the bare doped silicon was found to be approximately up to 5.8 degrees Celsius.
When it was tested on a commercial solar cell, the cooling technique was found to improve its yield by around 3.0%. “Thus, our findings can significantly impact the PV industry, as well as other radiative cooling applications,” the scientists concluded.
Radiative cooling was recently applied to solar panel cooling by researchers from France’s Institut des Nanotechnologies de Lyon (INL), the Purdue University in the United States, the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales in Spain, and the Jordan University of Science and Technology and the Australian College of Kuwait.
