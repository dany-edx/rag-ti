A collaborative project between WA-based engineering company Power Research and Development (PRD) and state-owned utility Western Power, the 1.5 MW Walpole pumped hydro project will utilise two purpose-built dams to provide 30 MWh of energy storage. The pumping mechanism at the Walpole facility will be powered by solar panels and batteries “making it self-sufficient,” Western Power said.
The facility will connect into the state’s islanded South West Interconnected System (SWIS) network and the project proponents said it will be used as a template for the development of similar microgrids in other areas of the state, and possibly nationally and internationally.
“The project has given us confidence to commence planning for other pumped hydro renewable microgrids on the edge of grid towns in WA,” PRD Director Colin Stonehouse said.
“Of around 30 well-suited towns we are looking at so far, our aspiration is to have five ready to proceed after Walpole.”
Stonehouse said work on the Walpole project is “proceeding to plan” with Denmark-based company MCC Contractors having commenced the main earthworks for the lower dam. Following the completion of the lower dam, works on the upper dam and pipe installation to connect the two dams will begin.
Western Power said it is finalising works to connect the energy generation facility to homes and businesses in Walpole.

The microgrid is expected to provide enough renewable energy to power Walpole for up to two days and Western Power said it is sufficiently sized to support the town’s future power needs, including charging electric vehicles and smoothing the ebbs and flows of local renewables on the network.
State Energy Minister Bill Johnston said the self-sufficient renewable solution will significantly improve power reliability for homes and businesses in Walpole with the project expected to improve power reliability in the area by as much as 80%.
“Walpole is at the end of a 125km-long feeder line that is exposed to disruptive elements such as vegetation and animals, storms, lightning and bushfires,” he said.
“The pumped hydro solution will reduce the number of outages in Walpole using green energy at no additional cost to businesses or the community while generating quality local jobs.
“This project plays an important role in our clean energy future, supports the increasing rise of renewables, and assists in balancing power demand and supply.”
The pumped hydro facility is expected to be operational by the second half of 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/08/research-team-takes-on-lithium-ion-tech-with-sodium-sulphur-battery/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 8, 2022",Research team takes on lithium-ion tech with sodium-sulphur battery,"An international team of researchers led by academics from the University of Sydney are hoping that a new sodium-sulphur (Na-S) battery, which they claim offers “super-high capacity and ultra-long life” and is far cheaper to produce than the dominant lithium-ion technology, will significantly reduce the cost of transitioning to a decarbonised economy.
Sodium-sulphur batteries have long possessed high potential for grid-scale stationary energy storage due to the low cost and high theoretical energy density of both sodium and sulphur. They have however been viewed as an inferior alternative and their widespread use has been limited by low energy capacity and short life cycles.
To overcome these limitations the research team has implemented a simple pyrolysis process and carbon-based electrodes to improve the reactivity of sulphur and the reversibility of reactions between sulphur and sodium.
The researchers said their battery displayed “unprecedented cyclic stability” and rate performance with a high initial capacity and a low-capacity decay rate of 0.05% per cycle over 1,000 cycles at room temperature.
Lead researcher Dr Shenlong Zhao from the University of Sydney’s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering said the battery has been specifically designed to provide a high-performing solution for large renewable energy storage systems, such as electrical grids, while significantly reducing operational costs.
The key ingredient in the battery is sodium-sulphur, a type of molten salt that can be processed from sea water which ensures the battery costs much less to produce than the lithium-ion alternative. The researchers said the Na-S battery is also less toxic than lithium-ion batteries.
“This is a significant breakthrough for renewable energy development which, although it reduces costs in the long term, has had several financial barriers to entry,” Zhao said.
“When the sun isn’t shining and the breeze isn’t blowing, we need high-quality storage solutions that don’t cost the Earth and are easily accessible on a local or regional level.
“Storage solutions that are manufactured using plentiful resources like sodium, which can be processed from sea water, also have the potential to guarantee greater energy security more broadly and allow more countries to join the shift towards decarbonisation.”
The academics said the lab-scale batteries have been successfully fabricated and tested in the university’s chemical engineering facility and there are plans to improve and commercialise the cells.
The research paper, involving contributions from researchers at University of Adelaide, University of Wollongong, China’s Chongqing University, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the University of Science and Technology China, was published in Advanced Materials.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/08/cell-switch-boosts-power-output-of-trina-vertex-s-module/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 8, 2022",Cell switch boosts power output of Trina Vertex S module,"The latest version of Trina Solar’s Vertex S All-Black, or Aesthetic module has power output up to 425 W and maximum efficiency of 21.3%. The Chinese manufacturer said single module power for the upgraded version of the series has increased by up to 30 W. This additional power has been achieved by implementing the latest 210mm rectangular silicon wafer technology instead of regular square-shaped cells.
The product is backed by a 25-year product and 25-year performance warranty. End power output is guaranteed to be no less than 84.8% of the nominal output power, while degradation in the first year should not exceed 2%.
Trina said the Vertex S Aesthetic module is compatible with mainstream optimisers, inverters and mounting systems available in Australia.
The module, which measures 1,754mm × 1,096mm × 30mm and weighs in at 21kg, has been designed for residential applications and commercial and industrial installations and Trina Solar Asia Pacific President Todd Li is confident the installer-friendly Vertex S will secure a significant share of the Australian rooftop PV market.
“We are seeing strong interest from Australian households for this product because of its performance, in terms of higher power output and efficiency,” he said, adding part of the appeal of the Vertex S Aesthetic module is its sleek look.

The Vertex S Aesthetic module appears more matte and has minimal glass reflection thanks to a double layer of anti-reflection coating (ARC). The module also has a uniform black colour due to a dedicated cell-blackening treatment.
“More and more Australian households are installing solar on their rooftops, so we make sure we offer a wide choice of module designs to complement various styles of roofs and help aesthetically-minded homeowners,” Todd said.
“The black colour cells with ultra-fine busbars, together with a fine layout of the black frame, back-sheet, black label and string busbars, makes Vertex S All-Black visually appealing for households.”
Trina said the first shipment of the upgraded Vertex S All-Black modules has already arrived in Australia and is now available for sale.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/08/neoen-nails-planning-approval-for-4-gwh-collie-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,FRANCE,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 8, 2022",Neoen nails planning approval for 4 GWh Collie battery,"Western Australia’s (WA) Regional Joint Development Assessment Panel and the Shire of Collie Council have approved Neoen’s plan to develop a stand-alone 1 GW /4 GWh battery energy storage system (BESS) near the coal town of Collie in the state’s southwest.
Neon said the project will include five individual 200 MW/800 MWh battery compounds with a total combined output of 1,000 MW/4,000 MWh. The project will be constructed in 200 MW/800 MWh stages “to meet the progressive increase in demand for energy storage.”
Construction of the first stage of the project is expected to commence in 2023 with Neoen predicting the facility will be operational “by or before 2025.”
Once completed, the first 200 MW/800 MWh stage of the Collie Battery will have the theoretical capacity to service the average energy needs of 260,000 households for an hour and will also stand ready to pump power into the grid in the event of a shortfall from other electricity generators, providing vital system security for WA’s main electricity network, the South West Interconnected System (SWIS).
“There is significant potential for the project to address intermittencies in energy supply due to the ability of utility-scale battery facilities to respond quickly to fluctuations in the grid,” the company said. “The project will also support the state’s objectives to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.”
The battery is to be built on a 31-hectare site about 12 kilometres northeast of Collie, approximately 215km southeast of Perth, and will connect into the transmission network via the nearby Shotts Terminal substation.
Neoen said the facility will typically charge during the day while there is excess energy generation and discharge during peak periods, helping to maintain a secure and reliable energy supply when WA ends its reliance on coal-fired power stations.
“With the retirement of the Muja and Collie power stations by 2030, this project will provide vital system security,” the company said. “The aim is to provide short-duration storage in the peak times to ease pressure on the grid.
“The battery will be able to provide grid stability and other grid services which will also encourage more integration of more renewable energy into the network.”

Neoen has more than 2.5 GW of renewable assets in operation or under construction in Australia, representing more than $3 billion in investment. The company intends to reach 5 GW in Australia by 2025.
Included among its portfolio is the now 150 MW/194 MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia, the world’s first big battery.
It also built the 300 MW/450 MWh Victorian Big Battery which came online in December 2021, and is also developing several other big batteries in Australia, including the 100 MW/200 MWh Capital battery outside Canberra, a 300 MW/800 MWh battery near Blyth in South Australia, and a 500 MW/1000 MWh battery to be built near Wallerawang west of Sydney. It has also submitted a development application for a of 200 MW/400 MWh battery facility to be built near Chittering in WA.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) said in a new report that the amount of global renewables capacity dedicated to producing hydrogen will increase 100-fold over the next five years. “For 2022-27, the main case forecasts around 50 GW of renewable capacity to be dedicated to hydrogen production, accounting for 2% of total renewable capacity growth,” it said in a newly published report. “China leads expansion, followed by Australia, Chile, and the United States.” It added that these four markets account for two-thirds of dedicated renewable capacity for hydrogen production. New capacity is split evenly between PV and onshore wind, with PV making up most of the growth in the Middle East and North Africa region. China is set to deploy more than 18 GW of dedicated renewables capacity by 2027, while Europe will add 7 GW. “Spain is in the lead, accounting for half of Europe’s growth, followed by Germany, Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands,” said the IEA, noting that regulatory and policy uncertainty are the two obstacles to for European hydrogen development.
The Netherlands is on track to potentially exceed its ambition of 500 MW of domestic electrolysis capacity by 2025, said Energy Minister Rob Jetten in a letter to the Dutch parliament. “In the coming year, the government expects about 1 GW of electrolysis capacity to be subsidised, after which investment decisions are expected in the short term,” he wrote. Jetten said he expects subsidies for 800 MW to 1,000 MW of electrolysis capacity through the Important Project of Common European Interest. The final selection of the electrolysis projects presented in September 2022 for the first round, with a budget of €783.5 million ($1.2 billion). The final aim is to reach 20 GW of hydrogen capacity by 2030.
Ørsted and Skovgaard Energy have signed a letter of intent to jointly develop a multi-phase Power-to-X facility in Idomlund, western Denmark. “The first phase of the project will have an expected electrolysis capacity of 150 MW and will be powered by onshore wind and solar PV,” said Ørsted. The electrolysis capacity could eventually increase to more than 3 GW, said the two companies. 
Jacques Delors Centre has published an interactive chart showing the cost of importing hydrogen to Europe via several routes. The tool considers gaseous pipelines, H2 liquefaction, and ammonia conversion as possible transportation options. 
Embraer has revealed two new decarbonized aircraft concepts, including Energia H2 Fuel Cell, a 19-seater with hydrogen-electric propulsion. It said that the relative technology should be ready in 2035. 
Hyliko has chosen Forsee Power as its partner to equip its first hydrogen-powered heavy-duty vehicles with the PULSE 2.5 intelligent battery system, said France’s first hydrogen mobility platform dedicated to decarbonizing road freight transport.
Alstom and Air Products have signed a memorandum of understanding to deploy hydrogen solutions in rail, including the necessary infrastructure in the Czech Republic.
