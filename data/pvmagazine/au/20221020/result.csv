“As part of Amazon’s commitment to be net-zero carbon across its business by 2040, the building is powered 100% by electricity, avoiding the use of fossil fuels for its heating and hot water systems, and with energy efficiency as a top priority,” the company said.
Amazon Australia said the rooftop installation is the largest solar PV system at an Amazon site in Australia with 3,078 solar panels covering 7,121 square metres of roof atop the purpose-built facility at the new Amaroo Business Park in Craigieburn.
Already operational, the 1.4 MW system is expected to generate 80% of the energy needs of the facility which is in the final stage of internal fit-out and is expected to be opened before the end of the 2022.
As well as the rooftop solar system, the facility also has 12 electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in place with the capacity to install 30 in the future, making up 20% of the site’s total car parks.
The Craigieburn sort centre is part of Amazon’s network of 17 sites around Australia and the company said the rooftop solar install will help the company meet its renewable energy goals, including its commitment to reach net zero carbon across its operations by 2040.

“Amazon is on a path to powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, reaching 85% in 2021, and is the biggest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world,” the US-headquartered company said.
In Australia, Amazon has signed power purchase agreements (PPA) for a combined 262 MW in clean energy capacity across three utility-scale renewable projects, including the 150 MW Suntop and the 110 MW Gunnedah solar farms developed in regional New South Wales by Canadian Solar. Since purchased by CalEnergy Resources, the solar farms are already delivering clean energy to the grid and Amazon.
Amazon also has a PPA in place to purchase renewable energy from the 96.6 MW Hawkesdale Wind Farm being built by Global Power Generation in Victoria’s Western District.
The three projects are expected to generate a combined 717,000 MWh of renewable energy annually for Amazon with the solar farms to contribute more than half of the amount.
Globally, Amazon has announced 154 utility-scale wind and solar renewable energy projects and 225 on-site solar systems on fulfilment centres and sort centres. Together, these projects total more than 18.5 GW of capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/20/australias-first-utility-scale-solar-farm-marks-10th-anniversary/,"LOOKING BACK,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 20, 2022",Australia’s first utility-scale solar farm marks 10th anniversary,"The first grid-scale solar plant in Australia, the Greenough River Solar Farm near Geraldton in Western Australia’s midwest, has notched a decade of operations after it was officially opened in Oct. 2012.
The original 10 MW Greenough River Solar Farm was the nation’s first large-scale solar power project when it was commissioned but it has since been dwarfed by the increasingly large utility-scale solar projects appearing on Australia’s landscape.
In the decade since the Greenough River Solar Farm came on line, more than 100 large-scale solar projects totalling almost 7 GW of generation capacity have been connected to the grid.
In the past year alone, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has registered 29 new generation and storage projects totalling 4 GW of capacity, including what is now Australia’s largest solar farm, a 400 MW power plant being developed in Queensland’s Western Downs region by the Australian arm of French renewables developer Neoen.
The 400 MW project, which is now exporting to the grid, forms part of Neoen’s $600 million (USD 376 million) Western Downs Green Power Hub.
The Greenough River Solar Farm was developed by Western Australian state-owned energy generator and retailer Synergy and GE Energy Financial Services before it was acquired in 2018 by Bright Energy Investments (BEI), a joint venture between Synergy, Dutch Infrastructure Fund and Construction Building Union Superannuation.

The original 10 MW first stage of the solar farm comprises 150,000 Series 3 thin film 85 W PV panels supplied by American module producer First Solar. The panels were mounted on fixed racking.
The output from the first stage has from the outset been purchased by WA’s Water Corporation to help offset the energy requirements of its Southern Seawater Desalination Plant near Binningup.
The capacity of the Greenough River Solar Farm has since been increased with a 30 MW expansion completed in 2020. Stage two comprises 300,000 First Solar 117.5 W Series 4 panels mounted on a Nextracker single axis tracking system.
The expanded solar farm now produces an estimated 98 GWh of clean energy per year to the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) – enough electricity to power the equivalent of almost 20,000 Australian households.
While no longer in the conversation when it comes to the largest solar projects in the country, BEI General Manager Tom Frood said the Greenough River Solar Farm has served as a model for utility-scale solar in Australia.
“Greenough River Solar Farm was a pioneering project when first developed by Synergy in 2012 and has been regularly recognised as one of the best performing in Australia since Bright Energy Investments’ stage two expansion in 2018,” he said.
“Stage two’s ability to tilt its panels to track the sun throughout the day has significantly increased the output of the now 40 MW solar farm to provide clean, affordable and sustainable energy for Western Australians.”
Operations and maintenance at the solar farm is handled by NovaSource Power Services, which took over the role from First Solar’s in-house O&M services branch last year.
NovaSource Australia country manager Daman Cole said Greenough River Solar Farm had been a great success story and he expects that to continue.
“It will forever be an important part of Australia’s energy history,” he said.

The Sydney-based developer said the next-generation components will now be manufactured for commercial deployment at an automated manufacturing plant to be developed in partnership with unidentified auto-industry manufacturing firms.
Vast Solar chief executive Craig Wood said on Thursday the company is currently in discussions with state and federal governments and investors to identify a suitable location for the manufacturing facility, which would be scaled up to become “the world’s first CSP gigafactory.”
“CSP is an industry in which Australia genuinely has the potential to be a world leader, and getting manufacturing up and running will ensure we don’t lose out to overseas competitors who are rapidly developing their CSP capabilities,” Wood said.
“Our CSP gigafactory is a big step forward for Vast Solar and, more importantly, Australia’s ambitions to develop a clean energy manufacturing industry,” Wood continued, noting the technology will be deployed in sunny countries the world over but manufactured locally.
The announcement comes as Vast Solar eyes potential projects in the United States on the back of investment incentives from the US government to advance the development of CSP technologies.
Vast Solar is part of a consortium, led by Solar Dynamics, that will receive $3.67 million (USD 2.3 million) from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to explore the use of CSP technologies in industrial settings.

Unlike traditional CSP technology which uses molten salt both as a heat transfer and for storage, Vast Solar has developed modular technology that combines the advantages of central tower CSP systems with a solar array. This modular technology is combined with integrated thermal storage that uses sodium for heat transfer and molten salt for on-demand storage, both of which create steam to drive a turbine.
The company said the technology allows plants to be configured with four to 16 hours of storage and generators of up to 500 MW.
The technology is on show at Jemalong in regional New South Wales where a 1 MW pilot plant, which was constructed adjacent to a 50 MW solar PV project, has been delivering electricity to the grid since early 2018.
It is also scheduled for deployment at Vast Solar’s 30 MW utility scale power plant near Port Augusta in South Australia. The company has also announced plans to develop a 50 MW baseload solar hybrid plant at Mount Isa in Queensland.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/20/victoria-to-target-95-renewable-energy-by-2035/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 20, 2022",Victoria to target 95% renewable energy by 2035,"Victoria’s energy network is set to undergo a mammoth transformation that will include the revival of the State Electricity Commission (SEC), a 95% reliance on renewables by 2035 with at least $1 billion (USD 630 million) to be spent on delivering 4.5 GW of renewable energy projects.
The state’s existing goal of 50% renewable sources by 2030 has also been increased to 65% by the end of the decade.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews and state Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio revealed the new goals on Thursday at a press conference in Melbourne.
“We will end reliance on privatised coal and transition Victoria to cleaner, cheaper renewable electricity by 2035,” Andrews said.
“Big energy companies want to offshore profits – we want to offshore wind. Renewable energy is the future; it’s good for our climate, good for lower power bills and good for jobs.”
The Victorian network was privatised in the 1990s but Andrews said if re-elected at next month’s state election, he aims to bring back public ownership of energy resources by reviving the SEC to build new renewable energy projects to replace coal-fired power plants.

Andrews said the new SEC will become an energy market proponent under a 10-year plan to deliver cleaner, cheaper energy, with all profits invested back into the network.
The state will retain a majority stake in the electricity commission with the super industry seen as the government’s preferred investor for the minority stake.
Andrews said the state government will invest at least $20 million to prepare the commission, including setting up an office in Morwell in the Latrobe Valley.
Another $1 billion will be invested to deliver 4.5 GW through renewable energy projects to replace the lost capacity from the anticipated closures of coal-fired power plants in the state.
Energy Australia has announced it will close the Yallourn power station in 2028, four years earlier than originally planned while energy giant AGL last month announced it would close its Loy Yang A power plant by 2035, up to 10 years earlier than previously planned.
“One power station is closed. Many smaller power stations will take its place. Those power stations won’t be for profit,” Andrews said.
“And because it’ll be 100% renewable,” he continued, “it will help us get us to net zero emissions a whole five years earlier – in 2045. It’ll mean Victorians will be back in control of our own power supply.”
Image: Supplied
Andrews said new emissions reduction targets will also be legislated as part of the overhaul, with the aim of 75% to 80% by 2035 and the existing net-zero emissions target will be brought forward by five years to 2045.
The deployment of 4.5 GW of new renewable energy projects builds on the 9.7 GW of renewable energy already powering Victoria and the recent commitment from the state government to an energy storage target of 2.6 GW by 2030 and 6.3 GW by 2035.
Clean Energy Council (CEC) Chief Executive Kane Thornton was among the industry figures who welcomed the announcement, saying it sends a “powerful signal to renewable energy investors that Victoria is determined to deploy large amounts of new renewable energy generation and manage the phase out of coal-fired generation”.
“The Victorian government has recognised the importance of co-investment and the critical role of the private sector when it comes to infrastructure projects of this size,” he said. “Victoria is replacing failing, costly and dirty coal-fired power with clean, reliable, low-cost renewable energy.”
The Victorian government anticipates the renewable energy initiatives will increase gross state product by about $9.5 billion and support 59,000 jobs through to 2035.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/20/selling-out-the-arena-how-grants-for-renewables-have-changed-over-time/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"OCTOBER 20, 2022",Selling out the ARENA – how grants for renewables have changed over time,"The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) funding gives new technologies a chance to prove their viability for eventual commercial use by the wider market.
Tracking where ARENA has provided funding provides an insight into what nascent technologies have been deemed important enough to warrant ARENA funding.
This Chart of the Week looks at a few trends from the ARENA funding over time, pinpointing future technologies that may shape the Australian energy market transition.
Figure 1 shows the funding awarded by ARENA since 2012 based on the project start date. As seen, the funding varied wildly from year to year at the scheme’s start, with large outlays in the first few years followed by relative droughts over the middle of the last decade. Since 2017, funding awards have been largely steady.
Image: ARENA
Not surprisingly, the mix of projects receiving funding has changed over time. For the period until 2021, funding was dominated by solar energy projects with also significant contribution to battery storage projects (see Figure 2).
Image: ARENA
Note that the funding figures above for solar include three projects that were awarded significant funding: $166.7 million for an AGL solar project in Broken Hill, $102 million for the Moree Solar Farm, and $129 million for the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics (ACAP) for research and training.
Looking at Figure 3, representing a more recent history, we can see that since 2021 (inclusive), the funding mix has changed significantly. More recently, higher proportions of funding have been awarded to battery storage, hydro/pumped-hydro, hydrogen, electric vehicles, demand response and solar thermal.
Image: ARENA
Again, this is not a surprise, as these technologies and initiatives will be part of the energy transition. An interesting observation is that solar energy has dropped down the scale significantly, perhaps proven as a commercial technology, thus not warranting ARENA funding to the same extent.
Overall, this points to the technologies that may shape the future of Australian energy systems under current government settings. It will be interesting to see whether funding for ARENA is affected by the upcoming Federal Budget next week.

Gaw Capital Partners confirmed in a statement issued on Wednesday that that it had secured a majority investment in Maoneng’s Australian business through its growth equity arm, Gaw Growth Equity Fund I.
The partnership, Gaw Maoneng Renewables (GMR), will accelerate the development of six grid-scale battery storage and solar power generation projects with a combined total of 1.9 GW. The projects are spread across Victoria, New South Wales (NSW) and South Australia. The new venture is also expected to explore other renewable energy opportunities.
Maoneng co-founder and chief executive officer Morris Zhou, who has been appointed CEO and managing director of GMR, said the transaction would allow for the development of the existing projects to be accelerated.
“We are very excited to partner with Gaw Capital in building out our renewable energy portfolio, including six battery storage projects,” he said.
“The transition to renewable energy in Australia is accelerating under this government’s policy,” Zhou continued, “and batteries are a key piece to the puzzle in facilitating higher grid penetration by solar and wind. The partnership allows us to focus on the job and to get it done sooner.”
The first of the projects will be the 240 MW/480 MWh Mornington battery energy storage system (BESS) being developed in Victoria’s east. The $190 million project has already received development and connection approvals, and construction is expected to start by the first quarter of 2023.

Other projects include the 225 MW/450 MWh Gould Creek BESS near Adelaide in South Australia, which has also gained development application approval, and the proposed Merriwa Energy Hub, which comprises 550 MW solar farm and a 400 MW/1,600 MWh battery energy storage system to be built in the NSW Hunter region.
Maoneng also has three other battery storage projects on the go in regional NSW, with about with 450 MW/900 MWh of energy storage spread between sites at Lismore, Tamworth and the Sunraysia Solar Farm site near Armidale. Maoneng, which co-owns the 200 MW Sunraysia Solar Farm, has plans to install a 50 MW/100 MWh big battery at the Sunraysia site.
Maoneng also retains ownership of the 13 MW Mugga Lane Solar Park in the Australian Capital Territory which was placed into voluntary administration earlier this year. Maoneng said at the time that the situation at Mugga Lane would not affect it development plans.
The estimated capex for the construction and build out of the portfolio is upwards of $2 billion and will be secured in the form of equity and debt.
Gaw Capital director Herbin Koh said the fund manager’s institutional investors had shown growing interest in the clean energy and ESG space in Asia and Australia.
“We have been looking for some time at a suitable entry into the clean energy investment sector, and utility-scale batteries underpin the dispatchable energy requirements for the grid to transition its mix from coal and gas to renewable energy generation,” Koh said, adding that he expects “this new renewable development and investment platform significantly in the coming years.”

The move comes after a seemingly innocuous change majorly disrupted both regional households and solar companies across WA’s south-western corner.
In February this year, Western Power implemented a new mandate for properties to install a main switch circuit breaker with any major electrical work – such as installing a solar system. The issue was that for regional properties, that circuit break would trip with a draw of over 32 Amps (an induction cooktop alone draws at least 20 Amps).
pv magazine Australia first reported on the issue in July 2022. On Wednesday, Oct. 19, Western Power announced it would begin increasing rural electricity supply allocations from 32 Amps to the standard 63 Amps given to urban properties after considering “recent community and industry feedback.”
The idea is to begin the increased supply allocated as a trial, though Western Power’s executive manager for asset management, Gair Landsborough, said he is “confident we’ll be able to standardise this.”
The trials will begin from now until March 2023, and will initially see the Shires of Boyup Brook, Bridgetown-Greenbushes, Collie, Donnybrook-Balingup, Nannup, West Arthur and Williams with increased supply allocations.

Landsborough noted that the new abundance of advanced metering technology means there is more detailed data than ever before.
“The data showed that the existing electrical infrastructure can support an increase in regional load, with network reinforcements to be implemented through our forward planning,” says Landsborough. “The trial will further support that the rural supply allocation is fit-for-purpose and we’re confident we’ll be able to standardise this, but we need to ensure this is managed in a safe and reliable way.”
The requirement for switch breakers to be installed following major electrical work will remain in place, though the hope is regional households won’t trip their power as soon as they switch on the oven.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/20/flood-crisis-prompts-victoria-to-fund-more-solar-in-vulnerable-communities/,"COMMUNITY,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",BLAKE MATICH,"OCTOBER 20, 2022",Flood crisis prompts Victoria to fund more solar in vulnerable communities,"The authorities, including Campaspe Shire Mayor Chrissy Weller, have described the flood crisis in northern Victoria as a one-in-1,000-year event. But after similarly misleading descriptions were already given to flood events in both New South Wales and Queensland in 2022, Australians are realising that extreme weather events are increasing in frequency.
As extreme weather events become increase, energy networks the world over are becoming increasingly vulnerable. On Oct. 16, rising flood waters from the Goulburn River breached a levee and swamped Powercor’s Mooroopna zone substation leaving 5,954 customers without power until it could be restored on Oct. 19.
However, the transition to renewable energy presents an enormous opportunity for increased resilience.
Following the lead of governments in regions similarly susceptible to extreme weather events, such as California, Victoria’s Labor government announced $7.5 million in funding for solar-supported resilience in at-risk communities.
Solar support
Victoria’s Minister for Energy Lily D’Ambrosio said the funds would be invested in back-up power systems comprised of batteries and rooftop solar in 24 towns hit by major storms in 2021. By concentrating solar back-up systems on community buildings, the government hopes they can act as relief hubs in the event of prolonged blackouts.
“With climate change set to increase the frequency and intensity [of] storms and bushfires, we’re developing energy resilience solutions to protect Victorian communities during extreme weather events,” says D’Ambrosio.
Among the towns identified by the government are the City of Greater Bendigo, Macedon Ranges Shire, Moorabool Shire, Mornington Peninsula Shire and Yarra Ranges Shire.
D’Ambrosio reiterated continuing renewable energy investment for communities across the state for “securing energy supply, driving down power bills and slashing emissions to combat climate change and mitigate its impact on Victorians.”
Microgrids
One of the most promising avenues for solar-supported energy resilience are grid-connected microgrids. These clusters of renewable energy and battery energy storage act as little power stations which can supply electricity to remote communities on vulnerable parts of the network should an outage occur.
In Victoria the state government is investing $9.8 million to form microgrids with a mix of solar, batteries, heat pumps and generators in the towns of Mallacoota, Omeo and Corryong.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/20/rooftop-wind-energy-innovation-claims-50-more-energy-than-solar-at-same-cost/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 20, 2022",Rooftop wind energy innovation claims 50% more energy than solar at same cost,"From pv magazine USA
A new bladeless wind energy unit, patented by Aeromine Technologies, is tackling the challenge of competing with rooftop solar as a local source of clean energy that can be integrated with the built environment. The scalable, “motionless” wind energy unit can produce 50% more energy than rooftop solar at the same cost, said the company.
The technology leverages aerodynamics similar to airfoils in a race car to capture and amplify each building’s airflow. The unit requires about 10% of the space required by solar panels and generates round-the-clock energy. Aeromine said unlike conventional wind turbines that are noisy, visually intrusive, and dangerous to migratory birds, the patented system is motionless and virtually silent.
An Aeromine system typically consists of 20 to 40 units installed on the edge of a building facing the predominant wind direction. The company said the unit can minimise energy storage capacity needed to meet a building’s energy needs, producing energy in all weather conditions. With a small footprint on the roof, the unit can be combined with rooftop solar, providing a new tool in the toolkit for decarbonisation and energy independence.
Buildings and the built environment account for nearly 50% of all carbon emissions globally, according to Architecture 2030. Building operations contributes about 27% of emissions, while buildings materials and construction, and other construction industry energy use are estimated to account for another 20%. This represents an opportunity for buildings to be made more efficiently, and to adopt innovative technologies to generate emissions-free electricity.
“This is a game-changer adding new value to the fast-growing rooftop power generation market, helping corporations meet their resilience and sustainability goals with an untapped distributed renewable energy source,” said Aeromine CEO David Asarnow. “Aeromine’s proprietary technology brings the performance of wind energy to the onsite generation market, mitigating legacy constraints posed by spinning wind turbines and less efficient solar panels.”
BASF Corporation is currently testing the Aeromine system at a manufacturing plant in Wyandotte, Michigan. The patented technology was validated through joint research with Sandia National Laboratories and Texas Tech University.
