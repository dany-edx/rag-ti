The decision was announced on Wednesday, paving the way for the approvals and assessment processes for the 700 MW/1400 MWh battery energy storage system to be streamlined as the state government looks to bring it online by 2025.
The battery forms part of the government’s response to Origin Energy’s announcement in February that it would close the 2,880 MW coal-fired Eraring power station at Lake Macquarie in the Hunter region in August 2025, seven years earlier than previously scheduled.
The government expects the Waratah Super Battery, to be located on the Central Coast, will be fully operational by 2025, releasing grid capacity to ensure Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong consumers can access more energy from existing electricity generation.
NSW Treasurer and Energy Minister Matt Kean said the declaration of the Waratah Super Battery to be critical infrastructure recognises the immediate priority of the project, describing it as “vital for the state’s energy future”.
“The Waratah Super Battery, with a capacity of 700 MW, will be the largest standby network battery in the Southern Hemisphere, acting as a giant shock absorber so that transmission capacity currently kept in reserve can be freed up to transfer energy to consumers,” he said.

Kean said there is currently existing generation that consumers cannot access because of constraints in the transmission network. The new battery will allow this reserve transmission capacity to be freed up. It does this by absorbing any power surge, keeping the transmission system within its technical limits if there is an energy shock.
Contracts to deliver the Waratah Super Battery are expected to be awarded later this year after an expressions of interest process conducted earlier this year attracted more than 30 proposals from around the globe.
The government has yet to reveal a final site for the project but said a number of parties have shown interest in building the battery on NSW government-owned land, including the former power station site at Lake Munmorah next door to the Colongra Power Station on the Central Coast.
Meanwhile, transmission upgrades that will ultimately link power grids across three states and connect Snowy 2.0 to the grid have received final environmental approval from the NSW government.
The state government on Wednesday announced it had approved nine kilometres of transmission lines to connect the Snowy 2.0 project to the grid. It also approved the eastern NSW section of the 900km EnergyConnect transmission interconnector that will link power grids across NSW, South Australia and Victoria.
The EnergyConnect project, a joint venture between NSW transmission company Transgrid and South Australian network owner ElectraNet, will link Wagga Wagga in NSW to Robertstown in South Australia, via Buronga with an additional ‘spur’ link between Buronga and Red Cliffs, in Victoria.

Construction of the project, which has already been approved by the energy regulator, has already begun in some parts. Work on the South Australian portion of the project commenced in February and Transgrid said its construction partner SecureEnergy JV had started work in June on the 135km western NSW section of the project, between Buronga, near Mildura, and the South Australian border.
While the 540km eastern NSW section, which will stretch from Buronga to Wagga Wagga, still requires a green light from the federal government, Transgrid chief executive officer Brett Redmond welcomed the state government’s tick of approval.
“We are pleased the NSW Minister for Planning has cleared the path for us to progress the second half of our $1.8 billion interconnector project,” he said.
“Today’s planning approval adds momentum to this once-in-a-generation transmission project that will reshape the National Electricity Market, making it possible for Australians to access cleaner and cheaper energy,”
Redman said more than 200 people are already working on the project, with delivery expected in late 2024. A 30-hectare accommodation camp and laydown with office facilities is taking shape at Buronga, to accommodate up to 340 workers. The existing Buronga substation will also be expanded to become one of the largest in Australia. Later this year, crews will build the foundations needed to erect the first of 1,500 transmission towers.
Work on the South Australian stretch of project also continues to progress, with the diversion of the Mokota and Canowie transmission lines now complete.
Electranet said this week that monopoles that were installed in February this year were successfully strung and connected to the augmented works at the Robertstown Substation. Work is also continuing along the interconnector route, with the installation of tower footings.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/15/unsw-engineers-build-high-speed-motor-to-boost-ev-range/,"EV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2022",UNSW engineers build high-speed motor to boost EV range,"Engineers at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) say they’ve built a high-speed motor that could extend the range of electric vehicles (EVs) by delivering a better power-to-weight ratio than existing technology.
A team, headed by Associate Professor Rukmi Dutta and Dr Guoyu Chu from the UNSW School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, said the new technology improves upon existing interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs), which are predominantly used in traction drives for EVs.
The maximum power and speed achieved by the motor has doubled the existing high-speed record of laminated IPMSMs, notching speeds of 100,000 revolutions per minute, making it the world’s fastest IPMSM yet built with commercialised lamination materials.
The engineers said more significantly, the motor is able to produce a very high power density, which is beneficial for EVs in reducing overall weight and therefore increased range for any given charge.
“One of the trends for electric vehicles is for them to have motors which rotate at higher speeds,” Chu said. “Every EV manufacturer is trying to develop high-speed motors and the reason is that the nature of the law of physics then allows you to shrink the size of that machine. And with a smaller machine, it weighs less and consumes less energy and therefore that gives the vehicle a longer range.”
The engineers said the design of the new motor, inspired by the Gyopo rail bridge in South Korea, also overcomes a flaw common with traditional IPMSMs. An IPMSM type motor has magnets embedded within its rotors to create strong torque for an extended speed range. However, existing IPMSMs suffer from low mechanical strength due to thin iron bridges in their rotors, which limits their maximum speed.

The UNSW Sydney team used a double-tied arch structure to design a new rotor topology and create a stronger version of the existing technology, delivering a better power to weight ratio.
“With this research project we have tried to achieve the absolute maximum speed, and we have recorded over 100,000 revolutions per minute and the peak power density is around 7 kW per kilogram,” Chu said.
“For an electric vehicle motor we would actually reduce the speed somewhat, but that also increases its power. We can scale and optimise to provide power and speed in a given range – for example, a 200 kW motor with a maximum speed of around 18,000 rpm that perfectly suits EV applications.”
The UNSW team said the new motor also offers a significant cost advantage over existing technology and uses less rare earth materials per unit.
“Most high-speed motors use a sleeve to strengthen the rotors and that sleeve is usually made of high-cost material such as titanium or carbon fibre,” Chu said. “Our rotors have very good mechanical robustness, so we don’t need that sleeve, which reduces the manufacturing cost. And we only use around 30% of rare earth materials, which includes a big reduction in the material cost.”
While the motor is still a prototype, Chu said it could be easily adapted to suit an individual EV manufacturer’s demands
“If an electric vehicle manufacturer, like Tesla, wanted to use this motor then I believe it would only take around six to 12 months to modify it based on their specifications,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/15/canadian-solar-to-unveil-all-in-one-residential-battery-and-inverter/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2022",Canadian Solar to unveil all-in-one residential battery and inverter,"Canadian Solar has announced it will launch its new EP Cube, a lightweight all-in-one battery and hybrid inverter with stackable battery modules, at the RE+ solar and clean technology event to be staged in California later this month.
The battery features stackable battery modules, adding customisability and minimising wall space needed for installation. It is compatible with both new and retrofit systems, and both AC and DC-coupled solar arrays.
One unit can scale from 9.9 kWh to 19.9 kWh in capacity, and up to six units can be connected in parallel, achieving 119.9 kWh of storage and 45.6 kW output, said the company. This is more than enough to fully power the average home with high-surge-current appliances and AC units.
EP Cube is designed to be lightweight and easy to install, featuring all-inclusive components and self-configuration for fast commissioning. Each battery module weighs less than 70 lbs., significantly lower than many residential units, which can weigh upwards of 300 lbs. The battery module measures only 6.25 inches thick and is NEMA 4X rated for both indoor and outdoor use.
The battery is compatible with the EP Cube app, which allows homeowners to monitor production and consumption in real time. Homeowners have access to their energy management through the app, and installers use the app to set up and troubleshoot the system. Updates are made remotely to the battery management system.
EP Cube operates with Canadian Solar’s “Smart Gateway”, a platform that enables automatic and seamless energy transfers for on- or off-grid use without user disruption.
“We are pleased to expand our clean energy offering into the residential energy storage market by launching the EP Cube, leveraging our existing partnerships and channels. The recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act will help the U.S. market transition faster towards clean power by increasing renewable energy accessibility through tax breaks and rebates. The EP Cube is a perfect solution for homeowners to use these incentives and invest in clean energy,” said Shawn Qu, chair and CEO of Canadian Solar.
Over the past two decades, Canadian Solar has delivered over 76 GW of solar modules to customers across the world. Since entering the project development business in 2010, the company has developed, built and connected over 6.8 GW in over 20 countries across the world. Currently, the company has about 311 MW of solar projects in operation, 5.3 GW of projects under construction or in backlog (late-stage), and an additional 21 GW of projects in pipeline (mid- to early-stage).

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/15/scientists-study-transparent-organic-pv-materials-for-solar-window-applications/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2022",Scientists study transparent organic PV materials for solar window applications,"Researchers from Michigan State University have built photovoltaic materials with two top layers made of phthalocyanine and heptamethine able to be deposited in glass windows for use in commercial buildings.
“We have used these types of materials in pilot production of transparent solar modules at Ubiquitous Energy,” researcher Annick Anctil told pv magazine. “We have recently installed these transparent solar modules on campus.”
The scientists proposed two different materials for two different kinds of solar glass. One is based on phthalocyanine (ClAlPc), a class of colorant that is commonly used for automotive paints, printing ink, and paper. The other one is developed with heptamethine (CyTPFB), which is a near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) compound that has recently emerged as a promising agent for drug delivery. According to the researchers, the materials offer higher transmittance of visible light than conventional semi-transparent building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) modules and selective absorption of near-infrared radiation (NIR).
The ClAlPc and CyTPFB are used as top layers of the transparent organic photovoltaic (TOPV) device, which consists of deposited layers of indium tin oxide (ITO) and molybdenum oxide (MoO3), and bathocuproine (BCP).
“ITO is deposited by sputtering, and all other layers are deposited by vacuum deposition except the CyTPFB active layer, which is deposited using a solution process,” the researchers said.
They simulated the use of the proposed materials in the windows of five commercial buildings in four different climates in the U.S.
“The TOPVs are assumed to be deposited inside the glass windows of the commercial buildings. The maximum window size is 2.1 meters by 3.7 meters, with silver grid covering 11% of the window area,” the scientists said. “The power conversion efficiency practical limit for ClAlPc TOPV is 10%, and 11% for CyTPFB TOPV.”
The researchers said that both versions of the solar glass have expected lifecycles of 20 years. The efficiency at the end of that period should be around 60% of the original efficiency, the claimed. They also found that the CyTPFB TOPVs have a 26.1% higher lifecycle impact than ClAlPc TOPVs, due to the higher energy demand of the synthesis and solution deposition processes.
“For most buildings, CyTPFB TOPVs have higher energy benefits because of a higher power conversion efficiency, but for hospitals, ClAlPc TOPVs perform better because of their spectral properties,” the scientists said.
The group presented the TOPV technology in “Net energy and cost benefit of phthalocyanine and heptamethine transparent photovoltaics in commercial buildings,” which was recently published in Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments.
“Future TOPV designs can be optimized and tailored to the building for both electricity generation and building energy savings by changing either the active layer or using low emissivity materials for the electrodes,” they concluded.
