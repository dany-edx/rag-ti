Figures published by the CER in its latest Quarterly Carbon Market Report show an estimated 68,250 rooftop solar systems with an average system size of 8.2kW were installed in the first quarter of 2022, a 31% reduction on the nearly 99,000 systems installed in Q1 2021.
The downturn follows five years of consecutive growth from 2016 where the annual added capacity of rooftop solar averaged 35% year on year growth, from 750MW to a record 3.2GW in 2021.
While there has been a slowdown in the roll out of rooftop solar, CER chair David Parker said if the current monthly installation rate continues installed capacity in 2022 will still exceed more than 2GW.
“We estimate added installed rooftop solar capacity in 2022 will be about 2.3GW. This is still the third highest annual capacity ever and is higher than pre-pandemic installation rates,” he said.

Parker said it had always been anticipated the uptake of rooftop solar would eventually slow, attributing the decline in installations to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which international borders were closed and many Australians had brought forward their investment in rooftop solar as discretionary spending in other areas was reduced.
“The decline this year is in line with the decline in home improvements spending which boomed during the first two years of the pandemic,” he said.
The CER said lower feed-in tariffs for households from energy retailers, concerns about future increases in interest rates and cost-of-living pressures were other reasons given for the slowdown of rooftop solar installations.
But with power prices soaring, the CER said the downturn could be short-lived as those who don’t have solar switch to the renewable energy to slash their power bills.
“If the prevailing narrative becomes that increasing wholesale prices are flowing through to increased electricity bills, then that may become a consumer consideration that moves the sector back to growth,” the regulator said.
While the small-scale sector has witnessed a downturn, the large-scale sector continues to grow strongly with investment in new wind and solar projects trending up.

Parker said the first quarter of 2022 was the third consecutive quarter with 1.3GW of utility scale wind and solar projects reached final investment decision (FID).
“Achieving more than 3GW of new projects reaching FID in the 2022 calendar year cannot be ruled out,” he said.
If that eventuates, it will be the third consecutive year where FID capacity has increased year-on-year.
The regulator suggested that its estimate of 3GW capacity reaching FID in this calendar year could well be conservative with rising wholesale electricity prices likely to trigger a surge in large-scale renewables industry investment.
The CER’s latest Market Report also showed there were record levels of cancellations of carbon certificates and units in the first quarter of the year.
Parker said Large-scale Generation Certificates (LGCs) had the largest year-on-year Q1 increase in both absolute numbers and percentage change with 1.2 million certificates cancelled, almost four times the previous Q1 record from 2021.
The number of Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs), surrendered in the first quarter was also up, with 283,000 ACCUs voluntarily cancelled in the quarter, an increase of 62% on the same time last year.

Tindo Solar chief executive officer Shayne Jaenisch said the partnership will enable more than 1,000 eligible panel installers and resellers to buy solar modules from the Adelaide-based company and get up to three months free from interest and repayments.
Jaenisch said the finance package provides a solution to the working-capital problem that many installers and resellers are confronted with.
“It can be hard for our customers because the industry is so competitive that they must have stock at hand for their installations, or customers can easily go elsewhere,” he said. “And to secure their stock, they have to buy it. Holding just 100 panels can cost around $25,000, if they’ve got a lot of work, they’ll have 500 panels ready to go.
“There’s a working-capital gap in this industry and the business owners don’t necessarily want to put their family home up as security.”
Jaenisch said the finance package offer by SME lender Moula Pay is a great solution to the issue with approved installers now be able to access the interest-free spend limit to increase their stocks of solar panels.
“We get paid immediately and release the stock, and our customer has up to three months interest-free terms,” he said. “We expect a lot of our customers to use the finance.”
Moula founder and chief executive officer Aris Allegos said while the package would free up cash flow for installers and resellers, it would also enable “the utility of renewable energy products in Australia and build toward a greener future”.
“Accessing working capital and payment solutions for resellers is a key enabler to accelerating the industry toward this goal,” he said.
Tindo Solar, which earlier this year opened a new $11 million expanded production facility at Mawson Lakes in Adelaide’s northern suburbs, manufactures a suite of solar modules, including a 405w rooftop panel for residential and commercial use, and a 550w utility-scale panel for larger projects.
The new factory has the capacity to produce up to 150MW of solar panel per annum and is more than three times the size of its previous factory.

“The model specification was recently approved by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC), a non-profit corporation that assures reliable electricity in 14 western US states, two Canadian provinces, and northern Baja, Mexico,” the research group said. “The approval means that the model is available to be integrated into commercially available grid simulation tools used by thousands of utilities in North America and other parts of the world.”
The researchers said their work builds on previous work demonstrating that grid-forming inverters can operate microgrids without conventional synchronous power generators.
“The outcomes of microgrid research suggested that grid-forming inverters can ensure system stability for integrating renewable energy sources into future power grids,” they said.
In their recent work, published on the WECC website, the PNNL scientists described the inverter main circuit representation, the droop control, and the fault current limiting function. “This model applies to energy storage systems and photovoltaic (PV) systems,” they specified.
“Our preliminary simulation studies based on the model show that grid-forming inverters can impact power system stability in a very positive way,” said Song Wang, president of the WECC modelling and validation subcommittee. “We believe the work done by PNNL will greatly help the utility industry better understand grid-forming inverters and their potential impacts on power systems.”
Looking forward, the US group said it wanted to create an ecosystem for grid-forming inverters and unify different models for grid-forming technologies and their diverse applications.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/13/queensland-pours-48-million-into-two-pumped-hydro-projects/,"ENERGY STORAGE,PUMPED HYDRO,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 13, 2022",Queensland pours $48 million into two pumped hydro projects,"Queensland has announced a $48 million investment as part of the 2022-2023 state budget to advance two new large-scale pumped hydro energy storage projects as the state looks to wean itself off coal-fired generation.
Queensland Treasurer Cameron Dick said $13 million had been allocated in the state budget set to be tabled on June 21 to accelerate key technical studies to enable a final investment decision on the proposed 1GW/24GWh Borumba pumped hydro project being developed near Gympie in the state’s south-east.
A further $35 million has been budgeted to advance a statewide search for a site for a second pumped hydro project to support the switch to renewables with storage seen as the key to unlocking Queensland’s renewable energy resources. Queensland is home to eight coal-fired power stations but the state government has committed to achieving zero net emissions by 2050, including a 50% renewable energy target by 2030.
Dick said growing Queensland’s energy storage capacity through pumped hydro, batteries and hydrogen is crucial to fully realising the state’s renewable energy opportunities and contributing to reliability and affordability.
“Renewable energy now accounts for more than 20% of Queensland’s energy generation, and we’re committed to powering that further,” he said.
“Large-scale pumped hydro energy has the capacity to deliver a reliable supply of energy in an economic way.”

Energy Minister Mick De Brenni said the $48 million investment set out a new path to storing renewable energy with pumped hydro to “play a critical role securing the future of Queensland’s energy system with a reliable supply of dispatchable power”.
“As Queensland charges towards its renewable energy target, large-scale storage projects like pumped hydro will enable the continued investment in wind and solar,” he said.
“We’ve already seen $11 billion of investment in wind and solar …. and we will continue to fund more mega projects.
“We are scheduled to deliver at least another 10 solar, five wind farms, three large-scale batteries and one pumped hydro scheme by 2024. This project pipeline will add more than 1,700MW of wind, 1,363MW of solar and at least 300MW of storage into Queensland’s energy system.”
The government’s latest investment includes up to $13 million to fast-track the development of the 1GW pumped hydro project being developed at the 46,000 megalitre Borumba Dam near Gympie.

The state government has already called for tenders for the project, which would feature 24 hours of storage, while work on a nearby 176MW solar farm has also commenced.
“This funding will support detailed analytical studies that will consider the long-term benefits of this proposed large-scale storage project,” de Brenni said. “Powerlink is managing the design and cost analysis, while extensive community and stakeholder consultation will heavily inform all final decisions.”
The Borumba Dam project, which is expected to be operational by 2028-2029, is among a suite of pumped hydro projects being progressed in Queensland.
Sydney-based developer Genex has commenced construction at its $777 million Kidston Pumped Hydro Storage Project being developed at the site of two abandoned gold mine pits near Kidston, about 270 kilometres north-west of Townsville in northern Queensland.
Genex said the construction program of the 250MW/2GWh facility remains on schedule for first generation in Q4 2024.
Melbourne-based consortium BE Power is also pursuing plans to develop a pumped hydro project in the state, teaming with GE Renewable Energy to co-develop the 400MW Big T pumped hydro storage project at Cressbrook Dam near Toowoomba.
The state is also home to the 570MW Wivenhoe pumped hydro facility which commenced operations in 1984.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/13/megasol-reveals-new-solar-pv-in-roof-system/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,SWITZERLAND",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JUNE 13, 2022",Megasol reveals new solar PV in-roof system,"Swiss solar module manufacturer Megasol has released a new in-roof system that it claims can be used to deploy homogeneous and flush-fitting rooftop PV installations.
The Nicer X in-roof system is available in two versions — the full-black and the translucent variants. The first system relies on 400 solar modules with a power conversion efficiency of 21.7%, black cell gaps, cross-contacts, and rear busbars. The second solution utilises larger, transparent cell spacing enabling light to penetrate by around 10%. Both solutions comprise three components: vertical supports, a ridge profile, and solar modules.
Megasol head of communications Michael Reist said installation is a simple process with the first step involving the screwing of the vertical supports directly onto the existing roof battens after the old tiles have been removed. In the case of a new building, reduced roof battens can be installed. In the second step, the ridge profiles are clicked and modules can be installed.
“The modules are laid completely without tools, they are pushed up to the upper stop and then closed, similar to a trunk lid,” Reist said. “An audible click and a corresponding haptic feedback confirm that it is securely locked in place.”

Reist said it is also possible to visually check whether the solar modules are securely fixed. With the manufacturer’s snap-lock fasteners, the modules can easily be attached and detached several times.
According to Megasol, 20 square meters of the Nicer X substructure and solar modules could be deployed by one person in an hour.
The manufacturer also offers matching eaves grilles for the system if required. The system is also claimed to be completely rainproof from a roof pitch of three degrees, which is achieved by a double labyrinth seal.
Megasol said the system is not only suitable for in-roof photovoltaic systems, but also for solar parking lots, canopies or facades. Existing parking spaces could be retrofitted and, in the case of facades, the system is particularly suitable for hall-like buildings or steel structures. In the case of non-insulated hall constructions, no further facade elements are necessary and the trapezoidal sheets can be left out completely.
