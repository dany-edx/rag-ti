iSwitch, which had pledged its support as a foundation customer for the proposed $26 billion Australia-ASEAN Power Link (AAPL) being developed by Sun Cable in northern Australia, announced it will cease retail operations on November 11, citing “current electricity market conditions”.
“Over the past six years, iSwitch Energy has had the privilege of serving the Singapore Electricity Market and collectively saving consumers over $150 million on their energy bills against the SP Tariff,” iSwitch said in a letter, addressed to its customers.
“We have also helped maintain focus on sustainability and the green goals that we know are so important to all of you.”
iSwitch’s demise could have ramifications for the proposed AAPL project which is to export solar energy from Australia’s Outback to Singapore via a submarine transmission link.
The independent retailer had in 2019 pledged to support the project as a foundation off-taker for the solar energy produced by the proposed 14 GW solar farm which is to be coupled with an estimated 33 GWh of battery storage.
The project, being developed on a 12,000-hectare site in the Northern Territory’s Barkly Region, is expected to supply power to Darwin and to Singapore via a 4,500-kilometre high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission network, including a 750km overhead transmission line from the solar farm to Darwin and a 3,800km HVDC submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore.
Sun Cable said the AAPL is expected to generate enough renewable electricity to power more than 3 million homes a year and will be capable of supplying up to 20% of Singapore’s total electricity needs, with supply commencing in 2027.
iSwitch made no reference to Sun Cable in its announcement but said customers’ electricity accounts will remain with iSwitch Energy until November 11, when they will be transferred to SP Group, Singapore’s state-owned power provider.
Singapore is the latest victim of surging global gas prices, which rose to record highs in Europe and in Asia this month. The climbing prices have also hit utility providers in the United Kingdom, where a number of energy companies have collapsed, while China and India are dealing with power shortages and blackouts.
Singapore’s Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong earlier this month advised households to conserve electricity with fossil fuel prices continuing to skyrocket.
Gan said fuel prices have more than doubled over the past 18 months with electricity prices climbing 54% in the first half of this year compared to a year ago in major advanced economies.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/15/fortescue-links-with-plug-power-to-build-electolyser-gigafactory/,"HYDROGEN,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,NORTH AMERICA,QUEENSLAND,UNITED STATES",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 15, 2021",Fortescue links with Plug Power to build electolyser gigafactory,"Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) and Plug Power have signed a letter of intent to create a 50-50 joint venture to build a ‘Gigafactory’ in Queensland, aiming to manufacture 2 GW of hydrogen electrolysers annually, with the ability to expand into fuel cell and hydrogen-related refuelling and storage infrastructure.
The $115 million manufacturing facility, to be built in Aldoga, west of Gladstone, was announced earlier this week as part of FFI’s bold renewable energy ambitions, which include establishing a global portfolio of green hydrogen and green ammonia operations with an initial plan to produce 15 million tonnes per annum of green hydrogen by 2030.
The Queensland plant will manufacture not only large-scale proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers, but also cabling and wind turbines to drive production of green hydrogen for global markets. FFI has also announced plans to develop a 1 GW solar PV module manufacturing plant.
“We need solar panels, wind towers, and electrolysers in such scale that we need to produce them where we use them – including in Australia,” FFI chief executive officer Julie Shuttleworth said.
“We have enough solar and wind in Australia to power many countries of the world. Working together with Plug Power, we can create this future.”
The joint venture agreement will see Plug Power supply the electrolyser and fuel cell technology while FFI will contribute advanced manufacturing capabilities. The first electrolysers are expected to roll off the production line by 2023.

FFI will be the primary customer of the products manufactured by the joint venture, enabling its ambitions in decarbonizing its operations with stationary power and mobility applications running on green hydrogen.
Under the agreement, FFI will also purchase 250 MW of Plug Power’s electrolyser solutions for use in its Australian projects. Plug Power will supply these from its existing manufacturing facility in New York, with delivery planned for the second half of 2022.
The Queensland factory is the third in Plug Power’s stable after it last week announced it would build a second gigafactory in South Korea as part of a joint venture with industrial conglomerate SK Group.
“Australia and New Zealand will be a big market opportunity for our green hydrogen ecosystem of electrolysers, fuel cells, and green hydrogen,” Plug Power president and CEO Andy Marsh said.
“This year, we will do megawatts of deployment in these markets, and gigawatts in the coming years.”
Meanwhile, FFI founder Dr Andrew Forrest has warned big business will shift overseas if the federal government is unable to support the transition to a decarbonised economy.
Speaking at the National Press Club on Thursday, Forrest said it was time the federal government came to the table and formally committed to a 2050 net-zero position before the COP26 talks which commence in Scotland on October 31.
Forrest said Australia could be a global energy superpower in the renewable energy “boom” but said without policy support from the Commonwealth the future of the nation’s energy market would stifle the potential benefit from being a mass green hydrogen exporter.

“It won’t happen at the same pace, or may not (even) happen in Australia,” he said.
“We will have to take our investments, our technologies, our ideas to those countries who will strongly welcome us.”
The federal government is currently committed to reducing emissions by 26-28% by below 2005 levels by 2030 but has not yet committed to a net-zero emissions target, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying that his desire is to reach the target “preferably” by 2050.
The government appears poised to announce a net-zero emissions target for 2050, and possibly a stronger 2030 target as well, after a draft plan was put to Cabinet on Wednesday.
National Party members will meet on Sunday to discuss whether they will back the Liberal Party’s proposal but Forrest said if the government didn’t nominate a clear 2030 target, “all of us in business don’t know what to aim for”.
“It’s like having an Olympics without medals,” he said. “I mean, you can talk all you like, but unless you’re gonna aim to win the race, you’re probably not gonna win it.
“The worst thing we can have to make investment decisions and business decisions is uncertainty. Remove the uncertainty, nominate a target for 2030, and let Australia crack on and go for it.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/15/morrison-set-to-attend-cop26-climate-summit/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 15, 2021",Morrison confirms he will attend COP26 climate summit,"Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Friday that the federal government’s position on a net-zero emissions target will be addressed before he jets out to attend the United Nations UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow later this month.
Under increasing domestic and international pressure to adopt more ambitious climate targets, Morrison had previously suggested he would not attend the climate conference but he has now reconsidered, describing the meeting as “an important event”.
“Overnight I confirmed my attendance at the Glasgow Summit, which I’m looking forward to,” he said on Friday.
Australia, the world’s second-biggest exporter of coal, has been under pressure from allies to step up its climate pledge with the federal government’s target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions well below those made by the United States, European Union and the United Kingdom, among other developed nations.
Australia’s federal government is currently committed to reducing emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2030 but it has not yet adopted a net-zero emissions target.
Morrison has previously said his desire is to reach net zero as soon as possible and “preferably” by 2050 but internal division within the government has prevented him from setting a legislated target.
It now appears he is leaning towards adopting a net-zero emissions target for 2050, and possibly a stronger 2030 target as well, ahead of the COP26 conference which commences on October 31.
A draft emissions plan was put to Cabinet on Wednesday with National Party members to meet on Sunday to discuss whether they will back the Liberal Party’s proposal.
While Morrison did not detail any new targets on Friday, he said the government’s position would be set out before he leaves for Glasgow.
“The government will be finalising its position for me to take to that summit prior to my departure over the next fortnight,” he said.
Morrison stressed that any commitment would “not just about hitting net zero” by 2050.
“That’s an important environmental goal,” he said. “But, what’s important is that Australia’s economy goes from strength to strength, and the livelihoods and the lives that Australians know, particularly in rural and regional areas, are able to go forward with hope and with confidence.
“And that’s what my plan will be all about, and I look forward to furthering those discussions in the weeks ahead.
“The challenge is not about the if and the when, the challenge is about the how. And I’m very focused on the how, because the global changes that are happening in our economy as a result of the response to climate change have a real impact, and they will have a real impact here in Australia.
“We are working through those issues with our Cabinet and with our colleagues, and I look forward to those discussions concluding over the next couple of weeks.
The Glasgow conference runs from October 30 until November 12.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/15/im-pickin-up-good-vibrations-5-minute-settlement-reviewed/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"OCTOBER 15, 2021",I’m pickin’ up good vibrations: 5-minute settlement reviewed,"In this Chart of the Week, we look at the difference in consecutive 5-minute price intervals (i.e. how much the price moves from one 5-minute period to the next as a measure of volatility) comparing the same period in October (1-12) from 2020 and 2021.
Interestingly, what we can see in the graph is that in 2020, South Australia (SA) saw a significant amount of volatility during the middle of the day as it struggled with rooftop solar penetration, which has mostly disappeared in 2021.
The volatility in SA in 2020 makes the graph appear as though there was more volatility in 5-minute pricing in 2020 than in 2021, however what we see is that the volatility is focused on SA and not across the wider National Electricity Market (NEM) regions. In this time period in 2020 there were 49 5-minute periods over $300/MWh – 40 of these (or more than 80%) were in SA.
In 2021 there were only 24, but more than 70% of these were in Queensland. Under the new 5-minute settlement, it appears that when those price oscillations do occur, the magnitude of the deviations can be significant. We can see this most notably in Queensland.
During the last couple of weeks, we also saw three instances of prices over $5,000/MWh all of which occurred in Queensland, compared to none at all across the NEM during this same time period last year. One of these periods saw prices go from $200/MWh, up to the market cap, and then back down to $200/MWh over three 5-minute periods.
We cannot yet attribute these large movements solely to the new settlement regime without more long-term data.
We are, however, seeing significantly more negative-priced periods across all states.
Total instances of negative prices rose from just over 2,000 5-minute periods in 2020 to more than 5,000 5-minute periods in 2021 – an increase of more than 140% (just under 250 additional hours). Victoria had more than 700 more instances than this period in 2020, and New South Wales (NSW) saw an increase in negative intervals from only 10 to over 500 (a more than 700% increase).
Again, not all of this can be attributed to the new 5-minute settlement, as this has also been driven by market conditions which saw minimum demand for the NEM broken earlier this month. The magnitude of the negative prices decreased in SA (-35%), Victoria (-9%) and Tasmania (-44%), but increased significantly in NSW (712%) and Queensland increased only slightly (10%).
At the same time as seeing an increased number of negative priced intervals, we have also seen a simultaneous reduction in both the volumes and prices at which renewable assets are willing to offer into the NEM. Interestingly, this hasn’t yet resulted in declining negative priced periods.
Between August and October, Solar plants across the NEM removed roughly half of their volumes ~30MW from their lowest priced bid band (~-$900/MWh) to slightly lower negative bands of around -$240/MWh and -$23/MWh. Wind also removed volumes from its lowest bands by about 30% or ~30MW into price bands around -$40 and -$2. Neither coal nor hydro have made any substantial changes to their bidding volumes or prices.
The ability to capture these price peaks, maximise (if you are storage) or minimise the impact of increased negative price periods, and understand the drivers of these changes will be paramount to developing a successful project in the NEM.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/15/coles-secures-path-to-100-renewable-energy-by-2025/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 15, 2021",Coles secures path to 100% renewable energy by 2025,"Coles is on track to hit its target to be powered by 100% renewable electricity by 2025 after confirming on Friday it has signed power purchase agreements (PPA) to source clean energy generated at a string of wind and solar PV farms across Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland.
The company said it has signed PPAs with Spanish renewables developer Acciona Energía and Australia’s biggest energy retailer Origin Energy and extended its existing agreement with French energy giant Engie to supply its estimated 2,500 stores and centres across the country with renewable energy generated at wind and solar PV farms throughout the National Electricity Market (NEM) jurisdictions.
Coles said by the end of the 2024-25 financial year its operations will be powered by clean energy drawn from several large-scale wind and solar PV farms, including Engie’s 119 MW Willogoleche and 46 MW Canuda wind farms in South Australia and Acciona’s 132 MW Mt Gellibrand Wind Farm in Victoria.
It said large-scale generation certificate (LGC) agreements have also been signed with several wind and solar farms which are currently being built.
These are likely to include Engie’s 215 MW Gregory and 200 MW Warhook solar farms being developed in central Queensland and the 120 MW Silverleaf Solar Farm the 120 MW Silverleaf Solar Farm near Narrabri in NSW. The projects are part of Engie’s plans to build a 2 GW portfolio of wind and solar farms in Australia.

Acciona is also building its solar portfolio, having recently received approval from the Queensland government for a significant expansion of its $550 million Aldoga Solar Farm project being developed near Gladstone. Originally slated as a 250 MW project, the project will now reach a capacity of 600 MWp.
The latest agreements come after Coles pledged in March to have all of its sites fully powered by renewables by June 2025.
Coles chief sustainability officer Thinus Keev said the new PPAs mean that not only has the company created a clear pathway to achieving its 100% renewable electricity target on schedule but it has also set the plan in motion less than a year after announcing the target.
“Our team is very proud that less than a year after we announced our target to be 100% powered by renewable electricity by the end of the 2025 financial year, we already have agreements in place to meet this commitment which in turn supports the growth of renewable electricity in Australia,” he said.
“We’ve seen a lot of emphasis on setting targets for emission reduction, but it’s vital that business follows through on their sustainability goals.
“Our latest agreements with Origin Energy, Acconia Energia, and Engie mean we can now say with confidence that Coles will meet our targets for 100% renewable electricity by June 2025, which is an incredible achievement.”

The new agreements add to the existing PPAs Coles had in place, including with global renewable power generation company Mytilineos. In June, the 30 MW Corowa Solar Farm in NSW became the first of three solar farms included in the agreement to be fully operational.
Coles has also signed PPAs with Lal Lal Wind Farms, Queensland state-owned clean energy company CleanCo  and French renewables developer Neoen.
In addition to the renewable electricity target, Coles also has an ambition to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
“We have a responsibility to help create a better Australia for future generations,” Coles Group CEO Steven Cain said.
Coles’ commitment means that the country’s three biggest supermarket chains will all source their power from renewable energy.
Woolworths has announced a goal to be fully powered by renewables by 2025 while Aldi announced in June it had achieved its commitment to power its operations with 100% renewable electricity six months ahead of schedule.
The transition was achieved using a three-pronged approach comprising of on-site generation via an extensive network of solar panels across stores and distribution centres, offsite generation through PPAs with Tilt Renewables’ 336 MW Dundonnell Wind Farm in western Victoria and Ratch-Australia’s 226 MW Collector Wind Farm in southern NSW and the acquisition of market renewable energy certificates.
“Aldi Australia’s stores, offices and warehouses are entirely powered with 100% renewable electricity,” the company said in an emailed statement.
“We are proud to be the first and only big Aussie supermarket to have achieved our renewable electricity goal earlier this year with the milestone reducing our carbon emissions by 85%.“
Greenpeace Australia Pacific REenergise campaign director Lindsay Soutar said Coles’ latest announcement signified the clean energy momentum building in the corporate sector.
“Coles’ announcement that it has cut deals to source renewable power through wind and solar projects is a sign of the growing corporate demand for renewable energy,” she said.
“Major brands have a critical role to play to use their buying power to bring even more new wind and solar farms online.
“This week the International Energy Agency has warned we must triple our spending on renewables to maintain a safer climate, and Australian businesses like Coles have a crucial role to play.”

Soutar said there has been a flurry of net-zero emissions reduction commitments from the business sector in recent weeks in the run-up to the COP26 Climate Summit in Glasgow. She said the renewable momentum from businesses is putting pressure on the federal government and Prime Minister Scott Morrison to commit to a stronger emissions reduction target.
“As the federal government dithers over a net-zero target, business leaders are rushing towards renewables,” she said.
“Australian companies and manufacturers know that cheaper, cleaner renewable energy is already powering the country, and are making smart investments to shore up their business for the future.
“Australia’s corporate sector has clearly indicated that it wants strong, decisive emissions reduction, and the Federal Government must develop policies that support investment and growth of renewables.”

Octopus Energy and RES have revealed plans to jointly invest GBP 3 billion (AU$5.5 billion) to build green hydrogen plants across Britain, powered by solar PV and wind capacity. 
The two companies plan to operate the facilities with renewable energy, in order “to accelerate the decarbonisation of industrial businesses … The aim of the partnership is to make the most of green electrons when they are generated in abundance on sunny and windy days by storing them as green hydrogen, helping the U.K. become more energy independent.”
The U.K. government unveiled a new national hydrogen strategy in August. RES and Octopus Energy said their planned investments are a direct response to the new strategy.
“We know that renewable-based electrification using wind and solar is the fastest way to decarbonise,” said Rachel Ruffle, EMEA CEO for RES. “When coupled with the production of green hydrogen, it becomes the natural choice for industry and our hard-to-abate sectors. Our partnership will enable industrial users to make the switch to reliable and cost-effective green hydrogen.”
Octopus Renewables claims to manage more than 300 solar PV, onshore wind, and biomass projects, collectively valued at more than GBP 3.4 billion. Earlier this week, it revealed that it had secured a new GBP 150 million corporate pension mandate from an undisclosed U.K. institutional investor to invest in renewable energy infrastructure.

Investment management company, VinaCapital Group today announced that France-based EDF Renewables has invested an undisclosed sum in SkyX Energy, one of its subsidiaries and the holding company of SkyX Solar.
Serving the commercial and industrial (C&I) solar sector, Vietnam’s SkyX Solar currently has around 100 MWp of PV projects either in operation or development, says VinaCapital, and it now plans on investing US$100 million in the roll-out of 200 MWp more over the next few years.
Samresh Kumar, CEO and Founder of SkyX Solar commented, “We intend to partner with more industrial companies in Vietnam to build many hundred MWs of solar capacity with them.”
According to Bloomberg NEF this January, Vietnam’s cumulative rooftop PV capacity reached 9.3 GW in 2020, with over 6 GW installed in December 2020 alone as project developers rushed to meet a December 31 solar feed-in tariff deadline. This represents an eight-fold increase from just 378 MW in 2019, noted the analysts.

Meanwhile, in its Global Market Outlook for Solar 2021-2025, European trade Association SolarPower Europe commented, “Vietnam is a very encouraging example, showing that the solar industry is now ready to develop even more sophisticated market segments like rooftop PV from basically zero to world record levels in a very short time – all it needs is the right policy and technical framework conditions, and a workforce with the right skillset.”
