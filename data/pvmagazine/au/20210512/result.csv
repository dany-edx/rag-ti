New figures released by AEMO earlier this week show that since March 1, 2021, the federal energy market operator has registered four new wind and solar generators in the NEM with a total capacity of 226 MW while five generators contributing a total of 383 MW completed their commissioning and in commercial operation.
The ongoing growth in renewables has served to offset concerns of potential electricity supply shortfalls triggered by the earlier-than-expected closure of the Yallourn Power Station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley.
EnergyAustralia announced in March it would shutter Yallourn in 2028, four years sooner than initially scheduled, building a 350 MW capacity big battery in its stead. The four-hour utility scale battery is expected to be complete by 2026.
The 1.45 GW Yallourn power plant currently supplies about 20% of Victoria’s electricity demand or 8% of the NEM and modelling from AEMO suggests its closure could lead to potential electricity supply shortfalls emerging between 2028 and 2030.
AEMO’s 2020 Electricity Statement of Opportunities (ESOO) Update models the Yallourn Power Station’s exit from the grid and additional ‘committed’ generation and storage projects not considered in the 2020 ESOO.
AEMO chief systems design officer Dr Alex Wonhas said the fresh modelling suggests there will be a breach of the market’s minimum reliability standards in the absence of a “further commitment of dispatchable capacity”.
“The modelling of the Yallourn exit and new connections since the 2020 ESOO result in an increase in forecast unserved energy (USE) for Victoria and South Australia,” he said.
“As a result, the Interim Reliability Measure (IRM) will be exceeded in both states in 2028-29 and 2029-30, unless there is further commitment of dispatchable capacity.”

While the loss of Yallourn’s capacity is an issue, figures published by AEMO indicate more than enough dispatchable capacity is expected to be built to address these reliability concerns.
“Based on the pipeline of registered and commissioned renewable projects, we’re well ahead of the 2020 Integrated System Plan’s ‘step change’ scenario which would see more than 90% renewable penetration, including rooftop solar PV, by 2040,” Wonhas said.
AEMO said more than 40 projects totalling nearly 4.9 GW completed registration or began exporting to the grid in 2020 while another 300 generation and storage projects totalling 55 GW are proposed across the NEM.
The 120 MW Gangarri Solar Farm in Queensland is among the new generators registered along with the 85 MW Winton Solar Farm and 7 MW Ferguson South Wind Farm in Victoria and the 14 MW Adelaide Desalination Plant Solar and Battery in South Australia.
The 100 MW Bomen Solar Farm leads the way for the new generators which have already been commissioned and are in commercial operation. Others include the 30 MW Molong Solar Farm in NSW, the 27 MW Maryborough Solar Farm in Queensland and the 144 MW Cattle Hill and the 82 MW Elaine wind farms in Tasmania and Victoria respectively.
Victoria has the strongest connection pipeline of any NEM state with 32.8 GW across 131 projects in the connection pipeline. Victoria’s proposed capacity is 80% more than the next biggest state, New South Wales, which has 8.1 GW across 52 projects in the application or completion process.
“We’ve seen registrations of new wind and solar projects in Victoria more than double from 467 MWs in 2019 to 1,146 MW in 2020,” Wonhas said.
“We expect registrations to further increase in 2021, with 2,000 MW of new wind, solar and battery storage projects forecast.
“These new generation sources will help transition our electricity market as two out of three of today’s coal-fired generators are due to retire by 2040.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/12/renewable-energy-on-back-burner-with-gas-confirmed-as-budget-focus/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 12, 2021",Renewable energy on back burner with gas confirmed as Budget focus,"The Federal Government has in the 2021-22 Budget allocated more than $1.6 billion for the energy sector and emissions reductions but renewable energy has been largely overlooked with just $49.3 million directed towards the sector.
The Budget, unveiled in full on Tuesday night, includes $30.0 million to support the proposed 35 MW Darwin big battery and the rollout of renewable energy microgrids in remote communities in the Northern Territory while up to $19.3 million has been set aside to support the deployment of a renewable energy microgrid incorporating hydrogen in the Daintree in Northern Queensland.
The Government’s spending on energy is primarily focused on low-emissions technologies with $643.4 million to be spent over the next four years, including $275.5 million to develop four additional hydrogen production hubs in regional areas, and $263.7 million for carbon capture and storage projects (CCS) and hubs.
Gas projects, including $5.6 million to further develop the Government’s National Gas Infrastructure Plan, will receive $58.6 million in funding.
A $24.9 million package to assist new gas generators become hydrogen-ready is also included in the Budget along with up to $30 million for early works on Australian Industrial Power’s (AIP) Port Kembla gas generator project.
Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said the Budget is supporting the Government’s responsible and pragmatic approach to energy policy and emissions reduction.
“Our 2021-22 Budget measures will provide reliable, secure and affordable energy to all Australians, and increase investment in technology solutions to reduce emissions in a way that supports jobs and economic growth,” Taylor said.
“This Budget builds on the Government’s existing initiatives to guarantee reliable and affordable energy, stimulate jobs and reduce emissions without imposing new costs on households, businesses or the economy.”

Critics have however been quick to condemn the funding focus with the Climate Council describing it as “a national shame” while Clean Energy Council chief executive Kane Thornton labelled it a “missed opportunity”, drawing attention to the lack of funding allocated for network upgrades which have been deemed critical for the ongoing delivery of reliable and stable electricity.
“If this truly is the infrastructure budget, Infrastructure Australia has identified that there is a need for major transmission upgrades to supply network access to renewable energy zones as a high priority, particularly in light of retiring thermal generation,” he said.
The urgency to invest in upgrading and modernising Australia’s energy grid has also been emphasised by the Australian Energy Market Operator, which on Monday said Australia is “well ahead” of the path to a 90% renewables scenario for 2040.
“The lack of transmission investment is now one of the most critical challenges facing Australia’s energy industry,” Thornton said.
“It’s disappointing that in a ‘nation-building’ infrastructure budget, upgrades that will enable the access and security of clean, low-cost power have not been prioritised.”

Nikola Casule, head of Research & Investigations at Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said the Government was simply “putting on a show” of taking action on the symptoms of climate change, without doing anything to tackle the root cause: the burning of fossil fuels.
“What’s worse, it’s throwing money at fossil fuel infrastructure and false solutions like Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) that only entrench the use of coal, oil and gas,” she said.
“The Coalition Government seems hell-bent on funding everything but proven, existing zero emissions technology like wind and solar”
Casule described the Government’s allocation of $263.7 million to finance CCS projects as a “profound waste of public money”.
“We already have the solutions to tackling the climate crisis in the form of clean and safe renewable energy, backed up by battery storage,” she said.
“The Coalition Government should not be wasting public money on technology like CCS that doesn’t work when it could be investing in the solutions like wind and solar that are already here.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/12/australian-battery-storage-assets-bring-french-developers-revenue-down/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 12, 2021",Australian battery storage assets bring French developer’s revenue down,"Renewable energy giant Neoen has highlighted the performance of its Australian storage portfolio, including the recently expanded 150 MW Hornsdale Big Battery in South Australia, as the major factor behind a 16% decrease in consolidated revenue for the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period last year.
Neoen has revealed that revenue dropped from $148.5 million (€95.8 million) in the first quarter of 2020 to less than $125 million (€80.2 million) for the same period this year. Storage revenue accounted for 7% of consolidated revenue in Q1 2021, compared to 23% in of 2020, dropping from $33.49 million (€21.6 million) to $8.22 million (€5.3 million).
Neoen chairman and CEO Xavier Barbaro said the main reason for the decline was the high base of comparison in the first quarter of 2020 when performance was boosted by the exceptionally strong level of revenue recorded by the Hornsdale Big Battery after a storm triggered the shutdown of the main South Australian ­- Victoria interconnector.
Barbaro said storage revenue was also depressed in the first quarter of 2021 by the less favourable market conditions for network services (FCAS) in Australia, as weaker demand for electricity during the period placed reduced strain on the grid.
“As expected, our first quarter revenue declined given the exceptionally strong level of revenue recorded by our storage activity in Australia during the first quarter of 2020,” Barbaro said.
While storage revenue was down for the first quarter, solar assets continued to perform well with revenue at 47% in the first quarter of 2021, versus 40% in the first quarter of 2020.
Wind contributed 46% of Neoen’s consolidated first-quarter 2021 revenue, compared to 37% in the first quarter of 2020, powered in part by the contribution of new capacity including early-generation revenue from the 194 MW Bulgana wind farm in Victoria.

The Bulgana wind farm, which includes 20 MW / 34 MWh of battery storage, began injecting electricity into the grid from the end of the first half of 2020, and continued to operate at a limited capacity in the first quarter of 2021.
Despite the decline in storage revenue, Neoen remains bullish about its Australian storage assets with construction having commenced on the 300 MW / 450 MWh Victoria Big Battery storage facility near Geelong in Victoria while planning documents have also been filed for a 500 MW / 1000 MWh big battery to be built west of Sydney.
The Victoria Big Battery, funded in part by a senior debt facility provided by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), shapes as one of the world’s largest battery storage projects and is on track to be operational before the next Australian summer
“We are thrilled to be building our second big battery in Australia,” Barbaro said.
“At 300 MW, it will be one of the largest batteries in the world, taking our total capacity in operation or under construction in Australia to over 1.8 GW, and bringing us one step closer to our global target of 5 GW by the end of 2021.”
Neoen’s capacity in operation or under construction totalled 4,145 MW at March 31 while the secured portfolio stood at more than 5.2 GW. The company is targeting a global portfolio of more than 10 GW of capacity in operation or under construction by year-end 2025 and Australia features prominently in those expansion plans.
The company has already received planning approval for the proposed Goyder South Hybrid Renewable Energy project in South Australia which is set to deliver 1200 MW of wind, 600 MW of solar, and 900 MW/1,800 MWh of battery storage.
Neoen has also reached financial close on the 460 MW Western Downs Green Power Hub in Queensland and has secured a contract to sell the majority of the future plant’s energy to Queensland Government-owned renewable energy generator CleanCo.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/12/tesla-shifts-battery-chemistry-for-utility-scale-megapack-energy-storage-system/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES,WORLD",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 12, 2021",Tesla shifts battery chemistry for utility-scale Megapack energy storage system,"From pv magazine Global
Tesla watchers report that the company has shifted to cobalt-free lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for its 3 MWh Megapack energy storage product. The shift to LFP cathode batteries could cut costs and ease demand for supply-constrained nickel-based battery production capacity.
LFP batteries are typically less expensive to produce, but they also are less energy-dense than the nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) cells used by Tesla in its electric vehicles.
The Megapack has a maximum energy capacity of 3 MWh per unit and is claimed to require 40% less space and fewer parts than other systems on the market. Reports said that with LFP batteries, the Megapack could see lower production costs, which could be passed on to customers of grid-scale storage technology.
Last year, the EV car manufacturer deployed 3 GWh of storage in a single year for the first time. That was an 83% increase against 2019. The company attributed much of this growth to the popularity of its utility-scale storage product, Megapack.
