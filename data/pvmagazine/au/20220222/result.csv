The modular system consists of the Q.VOLT inverter, which has a 5.0kW capacity and hybrid or AC-coupled options, and the Q.SAVE battery, which uses Samsung lithium-ion cell with storage volume of 6.86kWh. This battery can be paired up to three units for a maximum of 20.5kWh capacity.
Q Cells said the system is launching internationally first in Australia and Europe, and is scheduled for release to the general public in March this year. No information on the system’s pricing has been released yet.

The system has been selected for the Solar Victoria government-run virtual power plant (VPP) Pilot program, with the company saying it is “one of just a handful of approved partners” for the program and will offer participants a fully-integrated energy solution including Q Cells modules, 100% green VPP energy plan and the Q.HOME CORE.
The name of the Q Cells VPP offer is listed under ‘Arcstream,’ which is the full energy service offering from the company and includes Q Cells modules, Q.HOME CORE and a matching subscription model energy plan.
Victoria’s VPP pilot program is capped at 2000 rebates with the state government saying households that sign up to the pilot prior to June 30, 2022 and install a battery will receive a rebate of $4,174.
Back to Q Cells third generation of home battery system, the batteries are able to be both floor and wall mounted and will include an app enabling households to monitor their system data. “The energy monitoring system tracks PV module’s energy generation and consumption while maximising energy yields by incorporating real-time weather information,” Q Cells said in its product announcement.
“The software suite also includes Q.COMMAND PRO and Q.OMMAND GO, specifically developed for installers to allow fast and easy O&M services and installation commissioning, respectively,” the company added.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/22/the-battle-for-agl-heralds-a-new-dawn-for-australian-electricity/,"MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",,"FEBRUARY 22, 2022",The battle for AGL heralds a new dawn for Australian electricity,"From the Conversation
The first, on Thursday, was Origin Energy’s surprise announcement that it intends to close the mammoth Eraring power station in the NSW Hunter region in 2025, seven years earlier than previously advised.
Eraring is Australia’s largest coal-fired generator and supplies between a fifth and quarter of the electricity consumed in NSW.
The second, on Saturday, was a bid by a consortium led by Australian tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes for AGL Energy.
AGL’s board has predictably knocked back the initial non-binding offer. But the transaction has some way to play out, and the share price has risen in expectation of a more attractive offer.
Serious negotiations will now begin. It would be surprising if they were drawn out.
After having pushed on the door for so long, those striving for rapid decarbonisation have suddenly found the door flung wide open.
Cannon-Brookes has form when it comes to transforming power generation. In 2017 he challenged Tesla founder Elon Musk to build the world’s biggest battery in South Australia within 100 days and said he had “never been more happy to lose a bet” when it was built.
After spending as much as A$8 billion, his consortium would de-list AGL from the stock exchange and bring forward the planned closure of its coal-fired plants.
In partnership with the giant Canadian asset manager, Brookfield, Cannon-Brookes would spend as much as $20 billion on renewable power generation and storage.
AGL is Australia’s biggest greenhouse gas polluter, accounting for as much as 8% of Australia’s emissions. Cannon-Brookes says he would halve those emissions by 2030 and cut them to zero by 2035.
AGL is also a cultural icon. Originally called The Australian Gas Light Company and set up in 1837 by a NSW Act of Parliament before the advent of distributed electricity, it was the second company to list on what is now the Australian Securities Exchange.
One in every three Australian energy customers – about 4.5 million Australians – buy gas or electricity from AGL. It is by far Australia’s biggest energy supplier.
Those customers increasingly form its shareholder base. Australian superannuation funds are walking away on environmental concerns, while international institutional shareholders are edging away.
The bidders have indicated they will seek a way for existing shareholders to retain a share in what will become a privately owned company, if they wish to stay in.
AGL’s staff and unions will surely welcome new owners that promise a great deal of new investment to revitalise the company.
For much of the past decade, AGL has pursued a strategy of becoming Australia’s dominant fossil-fuel generator despite its early recognition – by Australian standards – of the reality of global warming.
It bought Victoria’s largest coal-fired generator in 2012, just as the Australian government introduced a price on carbon emissions. Two years later, it bought the Bayswater and Liddell coal generation plants from the NSW government, just as the Commonwealth government disbanded the carbon price.
At first, this coal strategy worked well for shareholders. The AGL share price more than doubled to reach an all-time peak shortly after the competing Hazelwood coal-fired power station closed in April 2017.
Since then, it has been all downhill. By the end of 2021 the AGL share price was less than one-fifth of its 2017 peak.
AGL’s coal generators, once so highly prized, have become an albatross.

Mid last year, it announced plans to split itself in two: a wholesale company that owned coal plants, which would transition to renewables, and a consumer-facing company that owned only renewables, storage and gas-fired peaking plants.
Earlier this month it brought forward the planned closure of its NSW Bayswater black coal-fired power plant, from 2035 to 2033, and brought forward the closure of its Victorian brown coal-fired Loy Yang A plant from 2048 to 2045.
With a share register of older Australians desperate for a stable dividend, AGL lacks the capital or ambition needed to complete the transition more quickly.
Taken together with Origin Energy’s intention to close its Eraring power station as soon as possible, Cannon-Brookes’ and Brookfield’s bid to buy AGL brings clarity, at last, to the closure of coal generation in Australia.
Although another four coal generators would remain in NSW and Victoria after the Eraring and AGL closures, they are smaller and have less strategic significance.
That would leave a substantial portfolio of coal generation in Queensland, owned by the Queensland government, which will come under political pressure to develop an exit strategy.
The AGL and Origin developments put the ball squarely in the court of the NSW and Victorian governments. It will be up to them to facilitate the rapid development of enough wind and solar generation and storage to ensure the lights stay on and electricity remains affordable.
This is a completely different dynamic to one that has dominated the landscape for the last decade. The big coal generators have folded, are heading for the exit and want help getting their customers safely to shore as soon as possible.
The changes also provide an opportunity to breathe fresh air into Australia’s alphabet soup of energy regulators. Caught between the need to prepare for decarbonisation and governments hostile to it, they have succeeded only in delivering thick layers of red tape, muddled thinking and half-measures.
In the face of this entrenched failure, the states with largely privatised electricity industries – NSW, Victoria and South Australia – have been steadily peeling away, going their own way, and getting on with the job.
There are enormous but surmountable technical challenges to be reckoned with.
Tens of billions of dollars of eager private capital will have to be corralled quickly into the development of wind and solar farms and storage, with new and strengthened transmission lines to connect them to where electricity is used.
Behind-the-meter household (and business) energy production and storage will have to expand quickly too.
The Commonwealth government was always an interloper in electricity. It never had a right to play on the main stage. If it can not bring itself to support the states in the challenges they face, it should direct its attention elsewhere.
At a moment of such enormous significance, it is difficult to not reach for cliches. This time, it looks as if there really is a new dawn breaking.

The company is on track to increase its revenue by more than 300% this financial year, the company’s CEO, Chris Williams, told pv magazine Australia.
The surge is the result of intermingling factors, Williams says, including expanding state battery subsidy programs, a dramatic drop in solar feed-in tariffs as well as the country’s ongoing issues with blackouts. “We’re seeing that real emotional driver underpinned by the state endorsement through the battery rebates,” Williams said.
In the second half of 2021, Natural Solar said its battery installations in Victoria grew around 350% – a figure Williams labelled conservative. “We’re probably seeing that figure is closer to 400%, 500%,” he clarified.
Nationwide, the company’s battery installs were 419% higher in August 2021 compared to 2019, with enquiries peaking in October 2021, where they were up 449% from 2019.
“92% of all of the systems we [now] install across the country residentially are either a combination of solar and battery, or adding a battery to an existing solar system,” Williams said, adding that home batteries are a major part of the company’s business model.
Generally only around 1% of solar installs in Australia include battery storage – but Williams thinks his experience with Natural Solar is proof the tides are changing. Williams is confident with the expanding financial incentives Australia could soon catch up to Germany’s lead, where half of all solar installs include storage. “That’s maybe 24 to 36 months away as the market progresses. But for us right now we’re in excess of 90%. So I think the proof is in the pudding and we’re seeing that significant growth right now.”
Natural Solar
Victoria’s solar battery rebate program is the biggest driver of growth for Natural Solar, with Williams saying it had driven a “major uptick in Victoria” since 2019. New South Wales is currently rolling out its Empowering Homes program offering households interest-free loans to install solar batteries. The company also worked with the Queensland government last year installing Tesla Powerwalls.
While battery subsidies are currently the domain of state governments, just last week federal independent Dr Helen Haines introduced a bill proposing to include home battery technology in the same Commonwealth-run renewable energy scheme that is behind the solar boom. The proposal has garnered widespread support and if passed it is expected to make home battery systems up to $3,000 cheaper Australia-wide.
According to Williams, Tesla remains the most popular home battery brand. “The definite winner in terms of battery uptake in Victoria has been the Telsa Powerwall,” Williams said. “That’s the product customers know about.”
On the topic of Tesla, Williams says Natural Solar has also seen a growing interest in electric vehicles (EV). While Australia still lags the US, Europe and China in terms of EV uptake, Williams says around one in five customers who installed a battery through Natural Solar have told the company they intend to purchase an EV within three to five years. Just two years ago, that figure for Natural Solar customers was more like one in 15.
Australia’s years-long residential solar boom is now reaching a point where in many jurisdictions networks are saturated. This has led different states to introduce novel new rules, like Western and South Australia where operators now have the capacity to switch off residential solar systems when the grid is under stress. In some postcodes, networks impose harsh export limits – or even no export limits.
This solar surge has meant feed-in tariffs for solar are also becoming rapidly less attractive, with Williams noting Australia’s two biggest electricity companies AGL and Origin cut their feed-in tariffs by 30% in October last year. “We argue that’s the straw that broke the camel’s back and we’re just seeing this huge influx of installations for batteries across the entire country,” he said.
Not long after the October cut, world leaders met for the Glasgow climate summit COP26 which trained media attention on the climate crisis. While the effects of the summit were more greatly felt in the corporate world, Williams said it’s also factored into regular Australians interest in home battery systems and renewable energy.
Frasers Property
At the end of 2021, Natural Solar installed the world’s largest array of Sonnen batteries at the world’s most sustainable shopping centre, Melbourne’s Burwood Brickworks.
Burwood Brickworks, owned by Frasers Property, is the first ever retail space to obtain the Living Building Challenge Certification, currently the most advanced measure of sustainability in the built environment.
Natural Solar installed 15 Sonnen 16kWh lithium-iron-phosphate batteries at the site in what Williams described as one of the company’s most challenging projects. 
It took 18 months to complete, he said, and required the company to look deeply into its supply chain, getting down to the sustainability ratings of things like cabling. Williams described the Living Building Challenge the retail centre followed as having a “really strong ripple effect” which forced all involved to examine granular details of their products and supply chains.
Frasers Property is undertaking a number of highly ambitious sustainability building projects in Australia, with Williams saying Natural Solar is eager to continue its partnership. “We’re definitely looking at multiple projects,” he said. “We think this is the first of many.”

The company is one of six nominated in the ‘Providing round-the-clock zero-emissions power’ challenge and is one of the first Australian companies ever to become a finalist in the program’s ten-year history.
Solar thermal is already deployed at scale overseas, with the International Energy Agency forecasting the technology will increase ten-fold to 73GW globally by 2030.

Concentrated solar power systems employ mirrors and receiving towers to gather and store the sun’s energy. It does this by using concentrated sunlight to heat a “curtain” of falling low-cost particles. The heated particles can then be stored and reheated later to power a turbine at any time, making the technology’s power output adjustable to grid demand.
The technology has had a disrupted history, from being hailed a great solution, to being wedged out by cheap solar PV coupled with finicky hindrances.
One of those finicky hindrances includes the molten storage systems’ hot tank, which had tended to leak because of thermal cycling and fatigue, resulting in substantial production losses for CSP projects.
However in December, a consortium including Vast Solar filed to patent a new tank design. The new design, it says, substantially mitigates the risk of tank failures.
Vast Solar’s technology has been proven at Vast Solar’s 1 MW pilot plant in Jemalong, New South Wales. The project was awarded the International Energy Agency’s SolarPACES Technical Innovation Award in 2019.

The company is currently developing several projects in Australia and overseas, including a 50MW baseload solar hybrid in Mount Isa, Queensland. The North West Queensland Hybrid Power Project, as its called, will combine solar PV, a large-scale battery and gas engines with Vast Solar’s concentrated solar thermal power technology. Approvals for the project are expected in the first half of the year, followed by two years of construction. Early generation could start in 2023 as part of a staggered construction program that brings some elements of the hybrid power plant into operations early.

Zinc-ion batteries have the potential for good energy storage performance out of cheap, abundant materials. Their performance and stability, however, remain a major hurdle to overcome in order to bring them closer to a wider commercial maturity. This storage technology, on the other hand, offers the advantage that, at the industrial level, it could potentially use many of the manufacturing processes already developed for lithium-ion batteries, making them far easier than other materials to scale up.
With this in mind, scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed an aqueous zinc-ion battery based on a special hydrogel electrolyte that is claimed to offer more stability and larger capacity.
The electrolyte was made with polyacrylamide (PAM), zinc sulfate (ZnSO4), glycerol (GL), and acetonitrile (AN). These compounds are said to offer remarkable mechanical properties, high ionic conductivity, and modulated bonding interaction. Furthermore, the researchers added acrylamide (AM) and N,N ‘-methylene bisacrylamide (MBA) into the mixture to address the typical issue of zinc-ion batteries — the poor stability and performance in the wide temperature range of -20 to 60 degrees Celsius.
“The copolymer of acrylamide and N,N ‘-methylene diacrylamide is the 3D framework of hydrogel electrolyte, and zinc salt is the zinc source,” they explained. “The copolymer increased the proportion of intermolecular hydrogen bond between copolymer and water molecule, but decreased the proportion of intramolecular hydrogen bond between water molecule. The bonding interaction regulation can reduce the chance of freezing at low temperature and evaporation at high temperature, which is beneficial to expand the operating temperature range.”
The battery showed high cycling stability of over 3,000 cycles, a high reversibility thanks to a Coulombic efficiency of up to 99.5%, and electrochemical performance of 185 mAh·g over 10,000 cycles. “Another advantage of this hydrogel electrolyte is its good mechanical properties for flexible device applications,” the research team emphasised. “The voltage of the zinc-ion battery device remained constant after it was bent at different angles.”
The battery was presented in the paper Bonding interaction regulation in hydrogel electrolyte enable dendrite-free aqueous zinc-ion batteries from −20 to 60 °C, published in the Chemical Engineering Journal.

Chinese storage system manufacturer Bslbatt has launched an off-grid battery for the off-grid storage of photovoltaic electricity.
Called BSL Box, the new modular battery is described by the company as a low-voltage device with a storage capacity of 5.12 kWh that can be expanded in stacking by reaching a capacity of up to 30.72 kWh.
The battery features internal plugs that eliminate the need for cable connections and all external cables can be integrated into one plug, which the manufacturer claims make the connection to the inverter easier.
The battery is claimed to provide steady operation for up to 6,000 charge cycles.
“The battery system has a service life of more than 10 years. Regarding compatibility, the BSL Box battery system can be used with well-known inverters such as Victron, Growatt, SMA, Studer, Fronius, Deye, and Goodwe,” the company said in a statement. “A further feature is that the BSL Box when communicating with the inverter allows for closer control of the battery and the ability to query battery data via the internet.”
The company claims that the battery can help smooth out peak consumption. “After installation, users can continuously monitor the consumption of solar panels and batteries via an application,” it also explained. “In short, thanks to the BSL Box, self-consumption can quickly increase by 30%, thus saving on energy costs.”
