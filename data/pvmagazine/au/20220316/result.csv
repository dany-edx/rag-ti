Moreover, the company believes it can reach gigawatt scale hydrogen production within a similar timeframe, saying its design is simple and mass manufacturable today. 
The company was born out of an electrolysis breakthrough made at the University of Wollongong, south of Sydney, around three years ago. There researchers led by Professor Gerry Swiegers discovered hydrogen could be produced far more efficiently using capillary-fed electrolysis.
This was verified in a paper published today in peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature, which found the capillary-fed electrolyser could produce green hydrogen from water at 98% cell energy efficiency.

The Hysata electrolyser consumes 40.4 kWh of energy for every kilogram of hydrogen it produces. The Nature paper noted commercial electrolysis cells tend to use around 47.5 kWh/kg, though Hysata CEO Paul Barrett claimed it was closer to 52.5kWh/kg. This equates to around 75% system-level efficiency, whereas the Hysata system claims a total efficiency of 95%.
This 20% efficiency boost has enabled the massive cost reduction Hysata says it’s only a few years away from making a reality. “You really collapse the project economics through that efficiency lever,” Barrett told pv magazine Australia. “And compounding on top of that, [Hysata has] a simplified system which really reduces the cost quite substantially.”
Barrett didn’t want to commit publicly to price of the Hysata electrolyser, but said the company is in conversation with around 30 “name brand companies” needing green hydrogen who are “thrilled” about the economics. 
“Our technology will enable hydrogen production of below US$1.50/kg per kilogram by the mid-2020s, meeting Australian and global cost targets much earlier than generally expected,” Barrett said.
Barrett said the company is busy building its pilot line of electrolysers in house near Wollongong now.  “We’re building a huge test capacity like today.” He is hoping to begin testing them in parallel within the next few months, with plans to ramp up the pilot line in 2023.

From pilot scale, the company wants to jump directly into gigafactories. To enable this, Hysata will grow its team of 20 engineers significantly this year.
“We planning to have systems in the field by 2025,” Barrett said.
“I’ve got plates working today at the efficiency and performance that we’ve got on that [Nature] paper, and our next thing is to basically string lots of those together, not unlike the way you’d string multiple solar modules together. We’ll connect them in series and that becomes our stack.”
The company “certainly” plans to keep its manufacturing in Australia, Barrett said, possibly remaining in Wollongong – which is right next door to the proposed Port Kembla hydrogen hub. 
“This can be an era defining company for Australia,” the CEO said, noting that Australia imports the vast majority of its renewable equipment today, like solar panels and wind turbines. “There’s a real opportunity to build sovereign manufacturing capacity here in Australia and export it to the world.”

This very much aligns with Matt Kean’s plan, the state’s environment and energy minister as well as treasurer. In February he announced $250 million in funding to boost locally manufactured renewable energy content and a further $300 million to build a renewable powered manufacturing base including renewable hydrogen.
The company is the “first in the world” to commercialise a capillary-fed electrolyser, according to Barrett. To date, he says electrolyser technology has been “too inefficient and too complex” to make green hydrogen attractive. Hindering efficiency in electrolyser cells is resistance, which has typically come from bubbles which are non-conducting and mask electrodes.
“[The research team at Wollongong university] basically looked at that problem with a blank sheet of paper and really tried to understand where all the resistance is inside the cell.” That exercise led to the invention of capillary-fed electrolysis which eliminates these bubbles and boosts efficiency. 
This leads to a “double whammy benefit on the economics,” Barrett says, because hydrogen projects would need less renewables to get the same hydrogen output, saving on capital outlays, while also only needing to purchase a smaller electrolyser.
The company’s electrolyser is fives times smaller than a traditional alkaline electrolyser, Barrett says, and contains 20x less liquid. It fits inside a 6 metre shipping container and is forkliftable for easy transportation, he added. “So we’ve got a drastically simplified balance of plan.”
Hysata’s electrolyser cell frame is made using a scalable, low cost and mass manufacturing technique – making the product nimble so it can get to market as quick as possible. 
“We’re one of the few, if not the only, electrolyser from time zero to be mass manufacturable,” Barrett said.

Hysata, a startup, only officially launched in June last year. It kicked off with $5 million in seed funding from the UK-based IP Group, with $750,000 from the government-owned Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC).
Professor Swieger, who led the University of Wollongong ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science research, has since become Hysata’s Chief Technology Officer.

Mercedes has said it plans to partner with Primobius for the design and construction of its future battery recycling plant in Kuppenheim, marking Mercedes’ first move into battery recycling. 
Mercedes is looking to go all electric by 2030, though lithium and other battery material prices have soared recently – making the 2,500 tonne a year recycling plant an even more urgent proposition. 
“The recovered materials will be fed back into the recycling loop to produce more than 50,000 battery modules for new Mercedes-EQ models,” Mercedes said.
The plant is to be constructed in two stages. “Initially, a plant for mechanical dismantling will be constructed by 2023,” the company said. The second stage, which it noted is subject to “promising” discussions with the public sector, would involve constructing facilities to employ Primobius’ hydrometallurgical battery processing technology.

“This means that in the future, Kuppenheim could cover all the stages from dismantling to module level, shredding and drying and subsequent processing of battery-grade material flows,” Mercedes said. The plant will make the company “more independent of raw material supplies in the future,” it added.
Mercedes said it is investing “a double-digit million euro amount” in both research and development and to construct the CO₂-neutral pilot plant in Kuppenheim. The project has also received the prospect of funding under the Battery Innovation Support Program of the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection.
Unlike the carmaker though, Neometals pointed out that legally binding agreements are yet to be signed between Primobius and Mercedes, though its managing director, Chris Reed, said he expects them to be finalised “in the near future.”
He added that he’s “proud” one of the “greatest names in the automobile industry” had made public its partnership plans with his company.
Primobius (Neometals & SMS Group)
In the second half on 2021, Primobius, half owned by Neometals with the other half belonging to German SMS Group, finished commissioning its battery recycling demonstration plant in Hichenbach, Germany. 
Primobius uses solvent extraction as its primary recovery tool, a process Reed says was actually invented in the Australian mining hub of Mount Isa in central Queensland. “It’s applying existing Australian technology into a new field,” Reed told pv magazine Australia last November.
What distinguishes Primobius’ process is its waste-free status. “We’ve developed flowsheets that not only try to maximise our recoveries, but that are actually green,” Reed said. “There’s no emission of any water, any waste water – we’ll be reusing that, and our tails are a fertiliser product and our CO2 footprint is very low.”
Given Mercedes is anticipating the recycling plant itself will be carbon neutral, Primobius’ process would be undeniably attractive to the carmaker. It has founded the subsidiary Licular GmbH especially for its foray into lithium-ion battery recycling.

Based on the findings of the Kuppenheim pilot plant, Mercedes said production volumes could be scaled up “in the medium to long term.”
The batteries the plant will recycle will originate from test vehicles, start-up batteries, possibly returns from the field, the company said. The materials it plans to recover are cobalt, nickel, lithium and, in future, graphite.
Mercedes estimates the recycling facility will avoid up to 70% of the CO2 emissions per battery, an increasingly important measure in Europe where carbon intensity is being closely watched and soon to be priced.
Scientific support for the project will be provided by three research institutes: the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and the Technical Universities of Clausthal and Berlin.
“With our new recycling plant at the Kuppenheim location, we are increasing the recycling rate to more than 96% while expanding our own expertise in the area of battery value creation,” Jörg Burzer, Member of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Production and Supply Chain Management, said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/16/world-has-installed-1tw-of-solar-capacity/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 16, 2022",World has installed 1TW of solar capacity,"From pv magazine USA
Milestones may be arbitrary, but the morale boost they provide is not. The world has very recently installed enough solar panels to generate  1TW of electricity directly from the sun.
The expectation that our species would hit 1,000GW of solar was first based on estimations that we installed at least 183 GW in 2021, and that we had 788 GW of capacity in place at the end of 2020. These two values total 971GW of installed solar.
To estimate our capacity at this exact moment, let’s assume that humans will install 210GW in 2022. Today marks the 73rd day of the year, which is exactly 20% of 2022. These numbers suggest that Earth’s solar capacity has breached 1,010GW, and that we can officially start measuring solar capacity in terawatts.
Let’s add two caveats to show the difficulty in obtaining a precise estimate: Overestimation can result from the small percentage of capacity that has been uninstalled, since roofs do sometimes get replaced, and severe weather events do occasionally destroy installations. Additionally, capacity numbers have been regularly underestimated because the installation data that researchers seek is constantly changing, and obtained from a number of manufacturers spread all over the planet.
The largest contributor to this capacity is China, who broke through – and blew past – 100GW in late 2016, or early 2017. The European Union hit 100GW in 2015, just before China. In the United States, the 100GW number was hit in the first quarter of 2021. These three regions represent more than half of the world’s installed solar capacity.
From a generation perspective, 2021 was also a milestone year. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2021, the world generated 26,823 terawatt hours of electricity in 2020. 855 of those terawatt-hours – 3.1% – came from solar. Since solar grew 23% in 2021, it is likely that next year’s BP Statistical Review will show that solar generation broke 1 petawatt hour of generation in 2021.
Going forward, models predict that dozens of terawatts of solar capacity will be needed to decarbonise the earth’s electricity, transportation, heating, and industrial systems.

Scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a lab-scale solar module cleaning system prototype that uses electrostatic repulsion to cause dust particles to detach and virtually leap off the surface of panels.
They described the system in “Electrostatic dust removal using adsorbed moisture–assisted charge induction for sustainable operation of solar panels,” which was recently published in Science Advances. They said it is a device that is able to “actively charge” dust particles and impart strong Coulombic force for dust repulsion.
“Our approach overcomes the prior limitations that occur due to reliance on relatively weak, short-range dielectrophoretic/triboelectric force and eliminates the issue of electrical shorting,” the scientists explained.
The waterless system can be operated automatically via an electric motor and is activated by an electrode placed on top of the module surface. The electric charge it releases repels dust particles from the panels. The bottom electrode consists of a glass plate coated with a 5 nm transparent and conductive layer of aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO), using atomic layer deposition (ALD). It is mobile to avoid shading and moves along the panel during cleaning with a linear guide stepper motor mechanism.
The system can be operated at a voltage of around 12V. The researchers said that it can recover 95% of the lost power after cleaning for particle sizes greater than around 30 μm.
“We use Arizona test dust (intermediate and miscellaneous test dust fractions from Powder Technology Inc.), also known as crystalline silica dust, whose chemical composition emulates that of typical desert mineral dust particles in our experiments,” the researchers said.
One of the researchers, Sreedath Panati, said that the group performed experiments at a range of humidity levels, from 5% to 95%. “As long as the ambient humidity is greater than 30%, you can remove almost all of the particles from the surface, but as humidity decreases, it becomes harder,” said Panati.
The simulations showed that the electricity consumption of the device is negligible.
“There is no current flow between the top and bottom electrodes and therefore no electrical power consumption. The only mode of power consumption is that associated with the translation of the moving electrode,” they said, noting that more cost reductions could be achieved by further reducing the thickness of the electrode coating.
