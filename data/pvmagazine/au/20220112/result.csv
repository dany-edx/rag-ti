It marks the takeover of the federally-run Clean Energy Regulator from the industry body the Clean Energy Council in setting the eligibility requirements for, and overseeing the operation of, installer accreditation schemes and the listing of approved solar components. The shift will see the industry supervised by a regulator with real teeth. 
The reforms coming into effect were recommended as part of the Integrity Review of the Rooftop Solar PV Sector, which was finally made public in September last year although it was completed long before. 
The new rules are intended to improve the integrity and accountability in the federal government’s rooftop solar subsidy, the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme. They will come into staggered effect this year, with the first tranche commencing on 1 April 2022.
The first suit of new rules include:
The Clean Energy Regulator has said it will conduct webinars and provide guidance material to prepare industry for the changes in the coming months. More information on the new regulations are available here.
The Victorian government is also taking a harsher approach to energy companies, including solar companies, cracking down on what it calls “harmful” high pressure sales tactics. 
The new prohibition of door-to-door sales or cold-calling came into effect on 31 December 2021 and builds on bans already in place for solar businesses under the Solar Homes Program.
“This is about improving transparency and competition in the energy retail market and ensuring that energy companies that do the wrong thing face appropriate consequences,” Victoria’s Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change, Lily D’Ambrosio, said.

The agreement will see the pair work together to develop operational and commercial hydrogen bus models “across the entire supply chain” including production, storage and refuelling, right through to leasing arrangements and maintenance.
Under the agreement, presumably BOC will focus on refuelling infrastructure, given that its parent company Linde has installed 200 hydrogen refuelling stations globally. This pivot from fossil gases to hydrogen follows a global trend among such companies, which are pushing to establish hydrogen vehicles in the transport sector ahead of electrified alternatives. 
Foton, on the other hand, seems to be looking after the vehicle question, with its parent company Foton Global having deployed more than 600 hydrogen buses worldwide.

The partnership, the companies said in their news release on Tuesday, will develop pathways for scaling up hydrogen bus networks in Australia and New Zealand, as bus operators move from pilot hydrogen bus projects to “widespread uptake across public transport networks over the next decade.”  The collaboration, they say, is needed to develop scalable, affordable hydrogen models.
Indeed there is a fair amount of interest in hydrogen buses in Australia, with the New South Wales government, Australia’s most populace state, saying it plans for a ‘good portion’ of its 8,000 strong bus fleet to run on hydrogen by 2030.
Foton are already well across this plan with Foton Mobility CEO Neil Wang telling pv magazine in January of last year that its ambition to supply NSW’s bus fleet transition.
Foton Mobility launched its hydrogen bus line in Australia in early 2021, beginning with a 12.5 metre low floor city bus powered by Toyota fuel cells. 
Of course, the vehicles are not necessarily produced, nor run on, green hydrogen gas. 
The companies are adamant hydrogen is preferable to electrification of buses though, saying they can be fuelled in 12 minutes, with one hydrogen refuelling station able to refuel 160 buses a day. Hydrogen buses have approximately 100 kilometres extra driving range than the typical electric bus, according to the companies.
“Hydrogen buses are already widely used around the world, with proven technology and infrastructure making it a viable option for the future,” Vesna Olles, Director Strategy and Clean Energy at BOC South Pacific said.

In documents published by Western Australia’s Environmental Protection Authority (WAEPA) this week, it can be confirmed that Woodside is proposing to build a 500MW (AC) solar PV facility including battery energy storage infrastructure capable of storing up to 400MWh. 
“Woodside Energy (Woodside) proposes to construct and operate the Woodside Solar Facility in the Maitland Strategic Industrial Area, located approximately 15 kilometres south-west of Karratha, in the Pilbara region of Western Australia”, says the proposal. 
The facility would cover approximately 975.6 hectares within a development envelope of 1100.3 hectares on crown owned land and that of the Traditional Owners, the Ngarluma People. According to the proposal the Solar Facility will see the installation of approximately one million solar panels along with supporting infrastructure including battery energy storage system and electrical substation. 

Woodside says all transmission of power from the Solar Facility to customers “Would be delivered via the North West Interconnected System (NWIS), through existing, upgraded, or new infrastructure constructed, owned and operated by Horizon Power for all users of the NWIS.” 
Construction of the Solar Facility would progress in 100MW phases, each expected to take six to nine months. And while each constructed phase would result in CO2 emissions in the realm of 212kt, the resulting green energy in the NWIS “will reduce customer electricity emissions by approximately 100ktCO2e/annum.” Those customers being industrial customers. 
Woodside says it is working closely with the Ngarluma Aboriginal Corporation (NAC) and has incorporated feedback into its updated proposal including sufficient commitments to ensure the protection of heritage features within the envelope area, ensuring heritage surveys prior to clearing operations, and ensuring at least 10% of all vegetation remains undisturbed, “including strands of old Acacia trees”. 
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the Burrup Peninsula, or Murujuga, is home to more than one million images carved into rocks over a period of up to 50,000 years, and the area has been nominated for World Heritage listing due to worries that industrial pollutants may be damaging for the art. 
Those industrial activities include Woodside’s North West Shelf and Pluto LNG plants, Yara’s ammonia and explosives plants, and the Dampier Port Rio Tinto uses to export its iron ore. 
The WAEPA will now review the referral. The seven day public comment period opened on January 10, with Woodside hoping to commence construction this year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/12/asia-pacific-solar-supply-chain-trouble-to-ease-this-year-according-to-analyst/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,INDIA,JAPAN",MAX HALL,"JANUARY 12, 2022","Asia-Pacific solar supply chain trouble to ease this year, according to analyst","From pv magazine Global. 
The supply chain problems which helped drive up the cost of solar power equipment last year will ease in 2022, according to Scottish analyst Wood Mackenzie.
A note issued yesterday by the U.S.-owned data company, which highlighted how such issues drove up the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) across the Asia-Pacific region in 2021, saw senior analyst Rishab Shrestha state: “Renewables’ supply chain bottlenecks are expected to ease in 2022 and beyond, and the respective LCOE will return to a declining trend.”
With Chinese polysilicon companies ramping up production facilities, WoodMac said an easing in supply problems, and related cost rises, would reverse a 9% year-on-year rise in the average cost of solar projects across the region recorded last year, to US$0.086/kWh – the first such rise in the history of the region’s solar industry.
The only market not to experience more expensive PV electricity last year was solar superpower China, in part thanks to the zero-tolerance Covid policy which has attracted so much attention in western nations of late. Rampant rises in the cost of fossil fuels in China, domestic solar manufacturing, and the nation’s climate change commitments were also factors, according to Verisk-owned WoodMac.
Steepling rises in fossil fuel costs last year ensured that even with their unusual price premiums, Asia-Pacific solar and onshore wind projects – the latter rising in cost 2%, to US$0.103/kWh – gained ground in their economic business case against gas-fired power projects, which became 46% more costly in the region in 2021, and coal plants, which cost 19% more than in 2020.
While solar and onshore wind facilities are 12-29% cheaper over their project lifetime than fossil fuel equivalents in India, China and Australia, “a significant renewables premium” across the other Asia-Pacific countries ensures such clean power plants are 16% more costly over their operating life than gas and coal generation sites, across the region as a whole.
That situation will be reversed by the end of the decade, according to WoodMac, which predicted solar projects, and to a lesser extent onshore wind sites, will together be 28% cheaper than coal across the Asia-Pacific market in 2030 and will achieve at least cost parity with gas. By that stage, solar and onshore wind will be 50-55% cheaper than coal in India, China and Australia, casting into doubt the efficacy of the successful push by the former two nations to water down a desired global commitment to phase out coal use, at the COP26 climate change talks in Glasgow in November.
With gas-fired generation costs potentially set to be driven up 70-100% by the costs of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology this decade, according to the analyst, the current 50% price premium of renewables with energy storage against the fossil fuel could be removed by 2030.
With around 70% of Asia-Pacific power generation based on fossil fuels, WoodMac research director Alex Whitworth hit out at what he said were plans by the Japanese government to base its future electricity generation on a mix of 20% green or blue ammonia – the latter produced from nitrogen plus hydrogen powered by CCS-equipped gas facilities – and 80% coal.
“A fuel mix of 20% green or blue ammonia plus 80% coal, as proposed, will cost around US$150/MWh even by 2030,” said Whitworth in the WoodMac note. “This is more expensive than gas power while still emitting almost twice as much carbon. A combination of offshore wind and distributed solar backed up by storage and gas units would have a similar price tag. Is Japan ready for a potential doubling of the average power generation costs in 2030 compared to recent years?”
