Cleanaway, which operates a network of waste collection, processing, treatment and landfill assets from more than 250 locations across Australia, said the program is expected to cut Cleanaway’s annual electricity bill by more than $500,000 a year and reduce its reliance on the national grid by about 20%.
The company said the installation of the rooftop systems would be completed before the end of the year. Included in the rollout is a 600 kW array of modules at the recently redeveloped $26 million Perth Material Recovery Facility (MRF) in Western Australia and a 99 kW system atop the organics recovery facility in Dandenong South, Victoria.
Cleanaway chief operating officer Brendan Gill said the company would have solar generation across 23 sites, including oil refineries, liquids waste facilities, and other MRFs when the three-phase program is completed.
“It makes economic sense to reduce our exposure to volatile electricity prices by generating our own power,” he said.
Gill said the rooftop solar rollout is expected to reduce the company’s annual electricity bill at the selected facilities by about 17%, or more than $500,000 a year, and significantly reduce the company’s reliance on the grid.
“In choosing which of our 250-plus sites were to be powered by the sun, we prioritised those that were likely to provide the fastest payback of our investment, but also considered factors such as roof size, angle, pitch and age, and operational hours,” he said.
“About 1.6 MW of panels are already in place and the remaining 0.8 MW will be being installed by the end of this year.
“Solar PV is a proven technology with little risk, and we look forward to realising the benefits of this investment immediately and over many years.”

Cleanaway said the solar program would also help the company achieve the goals set out in its Sustainability Report.
“Given the scale of our operations we’re aware that we can make an impact with improvements like this,” Gill said. “The program is another example of how we’re working towards our mission to make a sustainable future possible for generations to come.”
The rooftop solar program draws on a $90 million Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) corporate loan designed to accelerate sustainable practices in the waste management sector.
CEFC chief executive Ian Learmonth said the solar project was a “positive” step towards zero greenhouse gas emissions.
“The waste management sector generates significant emissions through landfill and energy use,” he said.
“Cleanaway is leading the industry in implementing new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and we congratulate them on this announcement.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/16/swiss-fund-to-finance-rollout-of-10000-solar-plus-battery-systems/,"COMMUNITY,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 16, 2021","Swiss fund to finance rollout of 10,000 solar-plus-battery systems","Thousands of Western Australian (WA) homes may soon be connected in a virtual power plant (VPP) project after Swiss fund manager SUSI Partners acquired a 50% stake in Perth-based renewable energy company Starling Energy Group which, through its retail arm Plico Energy, specialises in delivering integrated solar PV and battery energy storage systems for the residential sector.
As part of the deal, carried out through SUSI’s Energy Transition Fund (SETF), the fund manager has committed to finance the rollout of more than 10,000 solar PV and battery energy storage systems to be leased to residential customers.
SUSI said that once sufficient scale has been reached, individual systems could be operated as a VPP, using software to optimise consumption and dispatch patterns of multiple distributed energy systems while also providing grid services.
SUSI investment team managing director Richard Braakenburg said the transaction supports Australia’s move towards a decentralised energy system.
“We are committed to supporting the move away from centralised and emissions-intensive energy production towards an energy system that is decentralised, clean and empowers consumers,” he said.
“Western Australia is perfectly positioned to be at the forefront of this shift that needs to take place on a global scale to mitigate climate change, and we are happy to partner with Plico and WA communities to deliver this change.”
The agreement means participants will avoid paying for the equipment and installation up front with customers to pay a membership fee that covers the cost of the solar modules, in-home batteries and associated infrastructure.
“SETF’s funding commitment ensures that customers face no up-front costs, thus significantly increasing demand and accelerating the deployment of the systems,” SUSI said in a statement.
Plico, which entered the Australian renewable energy market in 2019 with the launch of the Dunsborough Community Energy Project, the nation’s first privately funded VPP, said it has installed 430 solar-plus-battery systems in the past 18 months and plans to more than double that number in the next year.
The company said its approach allows people to create and consume their own solar power energy day and night and at the same time collectively build a grid-scale battery which can be used as a VPP, allowing more variable renewable energy to enter the grid.
The latest announcement comes after Plico earlier this year revealed it had secured a $4 million capital injection that it said would allow it to grow its presence in the market.
That came after SUSI agreed in 2019 to provide $50 million infrastructure funding to support the rollout of residential solar-plus-storage systems in WA. That deal allowed for the aggregation of 1,000 individual systems into a VPP.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/16/alinta-switches-on-was-largest-remote-solar-farm/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 16, 2021",Alinta switches on WA’s largest remote solar farm,"Mining giant Fortescue Metals Group’s Chichester Hub iron ore operations are now being powered by solar energy following the completion of the 60 MW Chichester Hub Solar Farm in the north of Western Australia (WA).
Developed, owned and operated by Alinta Energy, the Chichester Hub Solar Farm has been operating at full capacity since late November and has already powered up to 100% of daytime operations at Fortescue’s Christmas Creek and Cloudbreak mining sites.
It is expected the solar farm, which comprises more than 160,000 solar panels spread across 120 hectares and is described by Alinta as the largest solar farm in WA on a remote network, will displace about 100 million litres of diesel every year. The mining operation’s remaining power requirements will be met through Alinta’s existing 145 MW gas-fired Newman power station and 35 MW/11 MWh battery energy storage system.
Alinta managing director Jeff Dimery described the solar farm, part of the Alinta Fortescue Solar Gas Hybrid project, as a “benchmark renewable project” and said the start of operations was a giant leap forward in the race to a low carbon energy future.
“We took an ambitious brief from Fortescue, who wanted to dramatically slash their emissions, and made it a reality in just three years,” he said.
“I can’t understate the engineering challenge of designing and building a renewable solution on this scale, in a harsh environment like the Pilbara, to meet the reliability standards of mines like these.”
The project also included the construction of approximately 60 kilometres of transmission line linking Fortescue’s Christmas Creek and Cloudbreak mining operations to the solar farm and Alinta’s existing Newman power station and battery energy storage system.
Fortescue chief executive officer Elizabeth Gaines said completion of the solar farm marks a major milestone in the delivery of Fortescue’s decarbonisation strategy, as the company works towards its ambitious target of being carbon neutral by 2030 for Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
“The project is a practical example of Fortescue delivering on its ambitious carbon neutrality target and demonstrates that renewables can power the energy needs of Australia’s mining and resources sector,” she said.
“As Fortescue transitions from a pure play iron ore producer to a green energy and resources company, this milestone is a critical part of our Pilbara Energy Connect project which together with the Chichester solar farm will see 25% of Fortescue’s stationary energy powered by solar.”
The project forms part of Fortescue’s plan to develop an integrated renewable energy power network in the Pilbara region.
The Alinta Fortescue Solar Gas Hybrid project received $24.2 million in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) while the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) supported the project with a loan of up to $90 million.
ARENA chief executive Darren Miller said the commencement of operations at the solar farm is a major boost towards a low carbon energy future.
“This is a monumental step forward to see solar and battery storage help to displace diesel on mining sites,” he said. “Optimising the transition to renewable electricity has been a key priority for ARENA and we are excited to see the Alinta Energy and Fortescue project now successfully using solar energy for the day-to-day operations of the mines.”

Chinese solar companies including Longi Green Energy are increasing investments in electrolyser production to slash prices and production costs, according to the Bloomberg Green unit of the U.S.-based business data service. The news service has run an article based on an interview with Wang Yingge, deputy general manager of Longi’s hydrogen energy technology unit. Longi reportedly plans to build 1.5 GW of production capacity of electrolysers next year, up from 500 MW today, to account for more than 60% of global electrolyser installations next year. The Bloomberg article emphasised, however, Chinese companies are lacking the public support they received to trigger the nation’s solar and wind industries.
Australian green energy company Port Anthony Renewables’ oversubscribed capital raising exercise has put a fresh AU$3 million [€1.9 million] directly into its commercial scale hydrogen precinct ahead of a planned Australian Securities Exchange listing next year. “The investor enthusiasm not only highlights excitement around the strategy at Port Anthony but the growing, global interest in hydrogen – especially green hydrogen – as the clean fuel of the future,” Port Anthony wrote yesterday. “The company had originally sought to raise [AU]$2.5 million but subscriptions totalled some [AU]$6 million just 48 hours after launching the cap[ital] raise.” Port Anthony is developing a commercial scale green hydrogen manufacturing and export hub less than 200km east of Melbourne and 78km from the Gippsland Basin natural gas pipeline network which carries domestic gas as well as fuel for export. Australian hydrogen companies, including Aviation H2, are seeking to raise capital. Several listings of Australian hydrogen companies are planned for 2022.
Netherlands-based chemicals producer Nobian and Australian multinational Macquarie’s Green Investment Group (GIG) are joining forces to form the Hydrogen Chemistry Company (HyCC). “Through this partnership, the companies are taking a unique step by creating a company that is specialised in water electrolysis to produce green hydrogen from renewable power at an industrial scale,” wrote GIG today. “With Nobian’s experience in large scale electrolysis and GIG’s resources and project development experience, HyCC will be able to accelerate investments and the development of more large scale projects.” HyCC will launch with a pipeline of more than 400 MW of electrolysis projects. The biggest is in Rotterdam, to replace fossil-fuel-powered hydrogen. GIG and Nobian will each have a 50% share in HyCC. The deal is expected to close in March.
U.S.-based Air Products has awarded Germany’s Thyssenkrupp Uhde Chlorine Engineers a contract to supply a more than 2 GW electrolysis plant for a green hydrogen project at Saudi Arabia’s new city, Neom. “Under this contract, Thyssenkrupp will engineer, procure and fabricate the plant based on their large scale, 20 MW alkaline water electrolysis module,” the German business said yesterday. “Upon commissioning, the project partners – Neom, [Saudi energy company] ACWA Power, and Air Products – will operate the facility, which will produce hydrogen to be synthesised into carbon-free ammonia for export exclusively by Air Products to global markets.” The start of production is scheduled for 2026. “With our large scale standard module size and gigawatt cell manufacturing capacity per year, together with our joint venture partner [Italian sustainable energy company] De Nora we are able to deliver large-capacity projects today,” said Denis Krude, CEO of Thyssenkrupp Uhde Chlorine Engineers.
U.K.-based green hydrogen energy company Protium has announced it will deploy its first 100 kW electrolyser in the U.K. by April. The electrolyser will be sourced from German manufacturer Enapter. “Dubbed project pioneer, the project will see Protium deploy the Enapter Electrolyser 2.1 which will be the largest integrated Enapter electrolyser in the field in the U.K.,” wrote Protium today, adding the generation of electrolytic hydrogen at scale will happen at Cardiff University’s newly established Hydrogen Propulsion Centre, in South Wales. Protium recently announced £2.65 million (€3.1 million) funding to decarbonise operations at the Bruichladdich distillery, on the Hebridean island of Islay. The company is also working on a 40 GW project in Teesside, England by 2026.

Energy company Royal Dutch Shell has announced it will acquire American solar and storage project developer Savion LLC and said it expects to conclude the deal this month.
Clean energy division Shell New Energies announced the move today in a press release issued on the Cision PR platform, but did not specify how much the acquisition will cost or how the deal will be structured.
The Anglo-Dutch energy business will buy Savion from the Green Investment Group owned by Australian investor Macquarie.
Shell said its planned new subsidiary boasts a pipeline running to more than 18 GW of solar power generation and energy storage projects across more than 100 projects in 26 U.S. states.
Quoted in today’s statement, Wael Sawan, integrated gas and renewables & energy solutions director for Shell, said: “Savion’s significant asset pipeline, highly experienced team, and proven success as a renewable energy project developer make it a compelling fit for Shell’s growing integrated power business.”
Shell in October announced it wants to halve its CO2 emissions – compared to its 2016 performance – this decade, including the removal of emissions from all its owned or controlled assets and from electricity it purchases. The company in February announced a plan to attain net zero carbon operations by mid century.
