Space-based solar power (SBSP) refers to orbital systems that collect and harvest solar energy using solar-powered satellites – enormous spacecraft with solar panels. Solar energy is converted into microwaves or lasers and then wirelessly transmitted via high-frequency radio waves to a fixed point on earth throughout the day. Once on the ground, a rectenna (a ground antenna) converts the electromagnetic energy into electricity and delivers it to the power grid for energy consumers. The main benefit of SBSP is its higher energy collection. As SBSP is unaffected by weather or time of day, it could provide clean, reliable, and more efficient energy for satellites, people living in remote communities, and disaster-hit areas worldwide.
The concept of collecting solar power in space is not new. However, in recent years, there has been growing interest in developing SBSP partly due to pressure to meet national and international climate-related goals and achieve national space plans.
While China, the US, Japan, India, Russia, United Kingdom, and the European Union are in the new space energy race to develop SBSP first, the two leading countries in this competition are the US and China.
In recent decades, China has become increasingly interested in SBSP and appears to be the leader in this area. In 2008, SBSP was listed as a key research program. In March 2016, Lieutenant General Zhang Yulin, a national lawmaker and deputy chief of the armament development department of the Central Military Commission, stated that China would make use of the space between the earth and the moon for solar power and other industrial development purposes. Zhang further linked SBSP to China’s national goals, declaring, “The earth-moon space will be strategically important for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.”
In February 2019, construction of a CN¥200 million (USD 28.4 million) testing base commenced at Bishan District in Chongqing, Sichuan. China Academy for Space Technology vice president Li Ming stated that China expects to be the first to build a working solar power station in space with practical value. Currently, Chinese scientists expect to construct small-to-medium-sized solar power stations to be launched into the stratosphere to produce electricity between 2021 and 2025 and build a megawatt-level SSPS in 2030.
In June this year, China announced it would launch an ambitious space solar power plant program in 2028, two years ahead of the original schedule. During the same month, researchers from Xidian University in Xi’an successfully tested a 75-meter-high steel structure to divert solar power from outer space.
Although the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) began researching SBSP technologies after the Apollo Program, which ran from 1963-1972, the enormous projected costs meant that this idea was not pursued. Nonetheless, there has been renewed interest in SBSP over the past few decades, including at NASA. The United States Space Force has also expressed interest, while the US Department of Defense is researching SBSP for military purposes.
There is also interest in SBSP at American universities. In 2013, the California Institute of Technology established the Space-based Solar Power Project after a donation of over USD 100 million. Last year, the university announced plans to launch an SBSP test array by 2023.
Once considered too expensive, today it is only a matter of time before SBSP is achieved, potentially creating a new age in clean energy.
This could further result in opportunities for collaboration as well as assist deep space exploration programs and provide an energy source for moon bases and lunar surface operations. SBSP and space energy may also become key in what economist Dr Pippa Malmgren calls “space-based solutions to earthbound problems.”
For instance, the resiliency of SBSP means that it could be used as a back-up energy source in the case of power shortages, blackouts, or attacks on energy infrastructure.
However, developing SBSP is not without technical and non-technical challenges. One of the main challenges is the cost barrier, including manufacturing, transportation, and the potential need for significant investment into transmission infrastructure. Other challenges to consider are the efficiency of wireless power transmission, the vulnerability of solar panels to space debris, and the impact on the environment and people. Nonetheless, it is expected that the costs will inevitably decline given the increasing interest from private companies in this area and technological advances.
Currently, China appears to be progressing at a faster and more concerted pace. As the country is already a contender in the global clean energy race and harbours ambitious space plans, China could become the leading space power if it develops SBSP before the U.S. and the rest of the world. This could result in SBSP becoming an essential element of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, with Beijing offering this form of clean energy to other countries alongside present opportunities for greater economic development and connectivity.
In a broader context, the increased interest in developing SBSP and space-based energy may extend the current geopolitical domain of competition to geospacer dimensions. The growing rivalry between the U.S. and China on Earth has already resulted in competing plans to achieve scientific and economic hegemony in space, including for space energy, mining, manufacturing, and space-based weapons.
More importantly, perhaps, there is also the increasing militarisation of space due to competition for military dominance. Currently, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) handles all space planning, with Beijing having already designated space as a military area. This adds to China’s 2019 White Paper, which emphasised a growing role in space for the PLA’s Air Force. A recent report also noted that China now has the technology, hardware, and knowledge to coordinate a war from space. To further support its space ambitions, China has increased the size of its total operational space fleets by around 70%.
The U.S.-China great power rivalry further adds to the militarisation of space, with both countries wanting to build lunar bases by 2027 (China) and 2025 (U.S.). Based on existing rivalry, competition between the countries to build bases on planets such as Mars is possible. In this context, it is not unrealistic to imagine that existing geopolitical and geoeconomic tensions on Earth will also be found in outer space, such as through exopolitics, or considered an extension of terrestrial activity.
Despite the geopolitical climate and tensions between the U.S. and China, the recent release of NASA’s Moon to Mars Planning suggests we are another step further to living and travelling between planets, not unlike Gerard K. O’Neill’s idea of free-flying space colonies in space. Does this sound too futuristic? Watch this space.

The CEC’s renewable projects quarterly report shows that only one project – ACEN Australia’s 400 MW Stubbo Solar Farm being developed in the New South Wales (NSW) central west tablelands region – reached financial close in the third quarter of this year.
Three new projects commenced construction in the third quarter, totalling 902 MW of capacity, while two projects were commissioned, adding another 127 MW into the network.
This was 169 MW less (-29.7%) than the second quarter of the year and 683 MW down (-63.1%) on the same period 12 months ago. The rolling quarterly average of financially closed new capacity over the past 12 months fell by 28.7% to 426 MW, down from 596 MW in Q2 2022.
The total quarterly investment in financially committed new projects reached $418 million (USD 282 million) in the quarter, down 59.3% on the previous quarter, and 75.8% less than the same quarter in 2021. This is its lowest level since data collection began in Q4 2017.
With modelling by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) indicating the need to build 45 GW of new wind and solar generation, plus 15 GW of storage by the end of the decade, to achieve the federal government’s target of 82% renewables by 2030, the report is a sobering reminder of the challenges ahead.

CEC Chief Executive Officer Kane Thornton said the report “makes it abundantly clear that Australia’s clean energy transition has been throttled by years of policy uncertainty.”
“Industry confidence to invest is growing, aided by clearer and more potent policy directions across the country, but the investment trend over the past year shows that we need a sustained focus on the energy transition from all governments,” he said.
“We need to see more projects coming more quickly through state planning systems and policy settings that send consistent signals for ongoing investment.”
Thornton said it is critical the energy market adapts to address concerns with the increasing complexity in connections with grid connection remaining a major challenge for renewable energy projects.
“We need to fix the connection and commissioning process to get projects through all the hurdles and actually start producing power,” he said. “The connection process was designed years ago to account for a few hundred megawatts connecting every few years.
“This highlights the importance of accelerating the reform of the connection process to get projects connected faster.”
Despite the slowdown in new renewable energy generation projects, the CEC pointed to investment commitments in large-scale storage projects as a bright spot for the sector during the third quarter of 2022.

While only one energy storage project – the 200 MW/250 MWh battery energy storage facility that will be co-located at the Stubbo Solar Farm – reached financial close in the third quarter, two other storage projects, representing 235 MWh of new capacity, began construction.
In addition, a record 14 new large-scale storage projects worth more than $2 billion were committed in the past year with the 12-month rolling average of energy output from utility-scale storage reaching a record high of 1,984 MWh – almost four times higher than this time last year.
Thornton said that this demonstrated a strong response from investors to the need for energy storage to support the transition to clean energy and manage the energy system but he acknowledged the levels must be accelerated into the future.
“We must provide the firming capacity needed to complement solar and wind generation and supply crucial system services such as system strength and inertia,” he said.
Of the energy generation projects, NSW contributed the most new financially committed projects and capacity over the past year, with its eight projects accounting for more than a third of new developments and 65% of new capacity. Victoria delivered six new projects accounting for 19% of new capacity, followed by Queensland with six projects (6% of capacity) and Western Australia with three (4% of capacity).
Since 2014, there have been 247 financially committed renewable projects in Australia, with 221 under construction and another 169 commissioned.

AEMO said the tool will allow project developers and their partners and electricity networks to rapidly test and refine their renewable energy plant and project configurations using the same wide-area power system simulations being used by the market operator to assess connections applications. The operator said the cloud-based environment also ensures users can preserve the confidentiality of their model data.
“In our role as system operator and planner, AEMO understands the national urgency to build out a large portfolio of generation and storage projects to maintain secure, reliable and affordable energy to replace retiring coal plants,” AEMO Executive General Manager System Design Merryn York said.
“We’ve developed the Connections Simulation Tool enabling users to test plant and control systems models against our models, a world-first for a power system operator, which will accelerate the grid-connection process.”
The connection process has been an ongoing issue for renewable energy developers in Australia and AEMO said the number of projects undergoing connection assessment across the NEM remains high.
For the 12 months to June 2022, AEMO registered 29 new generation and storage projects totalling 4 GW of capacity but as of October, 152 projects representing 21.6 GW were still engaged in the application, pre-registration, registration and commissioning stages.
“AEMO is working with network service providers to connect electricity generation and storage projects that are growing in volume, capacity and complexity,” York said.
“In the past 12 to 18 months, we’ve connected Australia’s largest battery (300 MW Victorian Big Battery), solar farm (400 MW Western Downs Green Power Hub), wind farm (511 MW Stockyard Hill) and hybrid facility (278 MW Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park).
“The Connections Simulation Tool is one AEMO initiative to streamline the connection process, remove delays and deal with the increasing complexity in connecting projects to the NEM.”
The Connections Simulation Tool has been developed with funding support from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) Advancing Renewables Program.

The first stage of the project comprises the 412 MW Goyder South wind farm which is expected to be operational in 2024.
ElectraNet Corporate Development Executive Ashley Manna said the state-owned network operator had executed a connection agreement with Neoen for 50% of generation capacity of the first stage of the Goyder South project. A new transmission line will be constructed to connect the project to the grid via ElectraNet’s existing Robertstown substation.
“This is the first half of Stage 1 of the development for Neoen, connecting initially 209 MW of wind generation,” he said. “A TCA for the second half is expected to be executed in the coming months for additional wind generation.”
Manna said construction of the connection assets is already “well underway,” with “energisation expected in early to mid-2023.”
Goyder South is a part of the planned Goyder Renewables Zone project which has received development approval for 1,200 MW of wind, 600 MW of solar generation and 900 MW/1,800 MWh of battery storage capacity.
Future stages of the project will be unlocked with the completion of Project EnergyConnect, the new 800 MW transmission interconnector linking South Australia with New South Wales.
Neoen has already secured energy offtake agreements for much of the output from the first stage of the Goyder project.
The Australian Capital Territory government has inked a 14-year power purchase agreement (PPA) for 100 MW of the project’s output while energy retailer Flow Power will buy 40 MW of the generation capacity to on-sell to its South Australian commercial and industrial customers.
Mining giant BHP has also struck a deal for some of the generation capacity after signing a 70 MW baseload renewable energy contract which will see its Olympic Dam mine operations in South Australia supplied with renewable energy from the Goyder South project as well as Neoen’s Blyth Battery from July 2025.

The company’s World Container Index (WCI) shows that freight costs fell by 7% this week, for the 39th consecutive week of decline, and by 74% from the same week in 2021.
“The latest Drewry WCI composite index of $2,404 (AUD 3,553) per 40-foot container is now 77% below the peak of $10,377 reached in September 2021,” the consultancy said. “It is 36% lower than the five-year average of $3,768, indicating a return to more normal prices, but remains 82% higher than average 2019 (pre-pandemic) rates of $1,420.”
Asier Ukar, the managing director of German solar consultancy PI Berlin S.L., told pv magazine that container shipping costs ranged between $1,500 and $2,000 before the pandemic. “At the peak of the pandemic and post-pandemic, it reached $20,000,” he said.
Freight costs currently represent about 4% of a module’s total costs, he noted. In August 2021, panels cost around $0.27/W and their share of free-on-board (FOB) module pricing was around 20%.
“Shipping costs now more or less $3,509, which means more or less around $0.01/W for a container with 620 modules with each a capacity of 400 W,” Ukar said. “Due to the Covid-19 crisis, most of the ports in the European Union and the United States were congested and the containers did not arrive at the port on time, which led to a reduction in the quantity and a consequent increase in prices.”
He added that he does not expect shipping costs to rise in the short term.

An international research group led by Professor Martin Green from the University of New South Wales in Australia has published Version 61 of the “solar cell efficiency tables” in Progress in Photovoltaics. The scientists said they have added six new results to the new tables since June.
“The tables include the result announced this week by Chinese manufacturer Longi, which achieved a 26.81% efficiency rating for an n-type silicon heterojunction (HJT) cell fabricated on an M6 wafer,” Green told pv magazine. “They also include the 26.6% efficiency achieved by Longi for an M6 p-type bifacial cell.”
The results include a 31.3% efficiency for a 1-square-centimetre device fabricated by the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM) and the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), and a 22.4% efficiency rating for a 26-square-centimeter perovskite mini-module obtained by EPFL and North China Electric Power University (NCEPU). The results also include a 24.5% efficiency rating for a 20-square-centimetre perovskite/perovskite two-junction, two-terminal mini-module made by Nanjing University and Renshine Solar, and a 47.6% efficiency rating for a four-junction, wafer-bonded concentrator cell based on Group III-V cell technology, with the cell fabricated and measured by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE). 
In Version 60 of the tables, released in June, the researchers added 15 new results. The group has seen major improvements in all cell categories since 1993, when the tables were first published. The research group includes scientists from the European Commission Joint Research Centre, Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, the US Department of Energy, and the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V, a metals supplier in the Netherlands, has said that its AMG Liva unit has started operating its first hybrid energy storage system. It combines lithium batteries and vanadium redox flow batteries at a facility owned by the group’s AMG Graphite subsidiary in Hauzenberg, Germany.
The company said it will use the storage facility to flatten production-driven spikes in electricity demand, as a backup power supply and black-start source in case of full power failure.
“The battery was developed by AMG Engineering and AMG LIVA, and it is also suitable for solar energy storage,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The representative said that the battery will be integrated with a large-scale solar power plant in the future. The aim is to further lower the facility’s energy costs and enable it to also provide grid services.
“All critical main parts are manufacturer of assembled in Germany,” the spokesperson said. “The vanadium redox flow battery is assembled in Hanau and the vanadium electrolyte in Nuremberg. The lithium-ion-modules for the Lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) battery come from strategic partners and the battery system is also assembled in Hanau.”
The company says the new battery ensures the optimal use of the technical and electrochemical properties of both storage technologies in a virtual battery configuration, and an optimal design for the energy storage assets. It reportedly takes advantage of lithium-ion battery tech’s high power and energy density, fast response time, and high degree of standardisation. It also benefits from the high cycle stability, fast charging-discharging, and flexible power-to-energy scaling of the vanadium redox flow battery concept. In addition, the battery offers automated monitoring and optimisation based on self-learning algorithms.
“The economic implications of our approach is that the battery offers advantages in terms of both power and energy costs,” the spokesperson said, noting that the system has an expected lifecycle of more than 20,000 cycles.
AMG Group is currently developing three additional LIVA batteries. It says one at AMG Titanium Alloys’ plant in Nuremberg will focus on peak shaving, the integration of solar power, and the production of green hydrogen. Another, at AMG Chrome in Rotherham, England, will be used for solar power integration. A third one at AMG Engineering in Hanau will be used as a demonstration facility for a range of applications, the company said.
