AirTrunk has signed a VPPA in Malaysia with renewable energy developer ib vogt. The deal has been billed as Malaysia’s first renewable VPPA for a data center.
The agreement will see AirTrunk procure energy from a 29.99 MW solar farm that ib vogt is currently developing. Construction is scheduled to begin in the middle of this year.
Malaysia’s Energy Commission enables businesses to sign VPPAs and participate in renewable energy projects through its Corporate Green Power program, which covers 800 MW of solar generation capacity. Developers can apply for up to 30 MW of capacity with secured offtakers.
“The decarbonization of supply chains in Southeast Asia is just beginning, and it is great to see Malaysia and AirTrunk taking a prominent position in the transition towards clean energy,” said ib vogt APAC Chief Executive Officer David Ludwig. “It is through powerful partnerships with industry leaders like AirTrunk that ib vogt continues to be in a leading role to support corporations in meeting their renewable energy goals.”
The announcement follows AirTrunk’s renewable energy agreements in Hong Kong and Australia. These include a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) for a new solar project in Australia and a renewable energy solution in Hong Kong that matches data center electricity consumption with local renewable energy certificates.
Ib vogt claims it has built or is now developing more than 3 GW of PV power plants throughout the world, with a project pipeline of more than 45 GWp, including 10 GW in Asia.
The Malaysian government opened its renewable energy market to PPAs in May 2023 and has set a 70% renewables target for its energy mix by 2050.

Under the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP)’s Pacific Climate Infrastructure Financing Partnership, a contribution is also being made to a new solar entrepreneurs’ partnership, which is expected to deliver rural renewable energy for up to 4,000 households in the Milne Bay and West New Britain Provinces.
The AIFFP is providing a $229 million (USD150 million) grant and concessional loan package to PNG to support the repair and upgrade of key energy assets, confirmed during Marape’s visit to Australia.
The commitment includes upgrades to the Port Moresby grid, where the focus is on installing new capacitor banks and transformers at crucial substations to strengthen power stability, mitigating instances of power outages in the region.
Previous talks in January between the PNG Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru and the former Australian High Commissioner to PNG Jon Philip saw Maru ask for help to fund the development of hybrid electricity systems, especially solar farms, in areas using expensive diesel generators, like Manus, New Ireland and East and West Sepik provinces.
“We cannot attract investors and grow and develop our economy without cheap and reliable energy,” he told local PNG media.
Currently only 20% of residents in PNG are connect to electricity with the government’s being 70% of the population by 2030, which was bolstered late last year during the signing of an agreement to establish the 5 MW East New Britain solar farm and storage project on 10 hectares at Wairiki.
Australia has committed $350 million in climate infrastructure for the Pacific region generally, including $75 million for a program for off-grid and community scale renewable energy in remote and rural parts of the Pacific.

The project was known as the Melton REH at one point.
David Russell co-founder and Managing Director Equis said the company found the equity partnership model to be a very effective vehicle for government industry collaboration to bring forward renewable energy projects.
“We think this model should be considered by other state governments because it allows investments to earn sustainable returns that can be reinvested in further renewable energy initiatives,” Russell said.
The largest battery system in Australia, the MREH will have up to 1,200 MW of charge/discharge capacity and has approval for up to 2.4 GWh of energy storage capable of servicing more than 1,100,000 households for up to 4 hours, or 200,000 during peak periods.
Under construction at Plumpton, Victoria, 32 kilometres from Melbourne’s CBD, the site is a confluence of critical Victorian transmission routes to the Melbourne metropolitan load that will firm up energy generated by wind and solar projects from the Victorian Renewable Energy Target auctions (VRET 1 & 2) and the Bulgana Green Power Hub, via a 500 kV transmission line.
Scheduled for completion in 2025, the co-investment partner, Victoria’s State Electricity Commission (SEC) will manage the MREH market operation.
According to Energy Infrastructure Australia (EIA), the MREH will also absorb excess roof-top solar from Victorian homes as it flows back into the transmission grid. It will also help regulate voltage and frequency on the grid, providing synthetic “system inertia” – providing the role filled by coal and gas fired power stations, which are set to retire over the next decade.
The project will use Tesla Megapack 2XL battery technology and a joint venture between Samsung C&T Corporation and GenusPlus Group will conduct the balance of plants (BOP) works for MREH.
Infrastructure provider Lumea is delivering the contestable connection assets for MREH as part of its delivery of the MREH substation, the Plumpton Renewable Terminal Station and AusNet Services will manage non-contestable augmentation at the Sydenham Terminal Station.
The MREH will also include a 12.5 MW co-located solar installation.

South Korean conglomerate LG has unveiled a new storage system for residential applications. The enblock E system is available in two versions, with usable energy capacities of 12.4 kWh and 15.5 kW.
“With just a few millimeters required on each side, the storage cabinet is not limited in any way when it comes to installation,” the company said in a statement. “Thanks to the IP55 protection class, enblock E can be operated in the cellar as well as in the garage without any problems.”
The system features lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP) cells manufactured by the group’s LG Energy Solutions unit. It is also compatible with inverters from major producers such as Fronius, Kostal, GoodWe and SMA.
The smaller model has a usable energy capacity of 12.4 kWh and a battery capacity of 56.6 Ah. The voltage range is between 180.0 V and 262.8 V, while the nominal voltage is 231.8 V.
The system’s maximum charge-discharge current is 36.5 A and the maximum charge-discharge power is 6.2 kW. The battery pack’s roundtrip efficiency is more than 95%.
The larger product offers a usable energy capacity of 15.5 kWh and the same battery capacity as the smaller product. The voltage range is between 225.0 V and 328.5 V, while the nominal voltage is 289.8 V.
The system’s maximum charge-discharge current is 36.5 A and the maximum charge-discharge power is 7.7 kW. The battery pack’s roundtrip efficiency is more than 96%.
The two different models measure 451 mm x 330 mm, which enables easy deployment in the “furthest” corners, said the manufacturer.
“Owners of a PV system can integrate enblock E on the DC side with a new solar system or retrofit an existing solar system on the AC side,” said LG. “If the originally installed storage capacity is not sufficient, enblock E allows an additional storage module to be retrofitted up to two years after commissioning.”

4,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/13/new-call-for-energy-upgrade-funding-for-low-income-homes/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",EV FOLEY,2024-02-13,New call for energy-upgrade funding for low-income homes,"The ACOSS Funding and Financing Energy Performance and Climate-Resilient Retrofits for Low-Income Housing report was released on Monday, Feb. 12. It states that 8 million Australian homes built prior to Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NaTHERS) score an average of 1.7 out of a possible 10, compared to new homes, which must rate between 7 and 10.
NatHERS is a nationwide rating scheme for new homes, recently expanded to “whole of home” to include solar panels and batteries to measure energy use (scored out of 100).
The report highlights 6.8 million homes in Australia are without rooftop solar and approximately 1.8 million are low-income households, which include 400,000 public and community dwellings, and 270,000 private rental households on the lowest incomes.

ACOSS Climate and Energy Program director Kellie Caught called on the federal government is to establish a Special Purpose Funding Vehicle to provide rolling funds for the upgrade of low-income social and private dwellings.
“Funding upgrades to make homes electric, solar and climate resilient will reduce poverty, protect against heat-related illness, bring down the cost of power and create local jobs while turbocharging Australia’s emissions reduction targets.”
“The federal government should prioritise investment now to cut household energy bills, and ensure disadvantaged people and communities are not left behind in the energy transition,” she said.
The Australian Photovoltaic Institute has completed analysis of the types of savings available to low-income homes referenced in the report. The analysis shows the average bill reduction for a family of four, using 15 kWh of energy per day with a 6.5 kW solar system, is between $1,134 (USD739) a year in Victoria and up to $1,822 (USD1187) in South Australia.
The federal government is already dedicating funds to support the electrification of households through several schemes, including the $1 billion Household Energy Upgrades Fund, which provides loans to upgrade homes with battery-ready solar, modern energy-efficient appliances and other improvements.
State and territories
States and territories are also rolling out a swathe of initiatives targeting low-income and social housing such as the Sustainable Household Scheme (ACT), which provides zero interest loans for households to install solar, batteries, high efficiency electric appliances, insulation, electric vehicles and chargers, and roof top solar rebates or the Home and Business Battery Scheme Grants (Northern Territory) of $450 per kWh of capacity up to a cap of for household battery systems.
The Smart Energy for Social Housing plan (WA) involves solar panels installed on 500 social housing properties and battery storage systems for regional towns to enable an additional 10 MW of rooftop solar to be installed on regional households by improving grid stability.
The NSW government has in place its Solar for Low Income Households Rebate Swap that helps eligible low-income households to install a free 3 kW solar system and together with the federal government earmarked 30,000 homes for energy upgrades.
The Special Purpose Funding Vehicle sought by ACOSS is in addition to these initiatives, seeking an all-encompassing $2 billion package to provide rolling funds for upgrading low-income housing, including a seven-year program to fund energy performance and climate resilience retrofits for all public, community and First Nations community-controlled housing.
The establishment of an Environmental Upgrade Finance (EUF) program through the states and federal government would provide long-term and low-interest loans that are repaid through council rates along with zero-interest loans and subsidies for low-income owner-occupiers.
Low-interest loans and conditional subsidies would be provided for landlords for private rental properties tied to minimum energy standards until the EUF is up and running.
“Direct government funding for low-income housing would build economies of scale and market capacity to slash housing retrofit costs across the board,” ACOSS’ Caught said.
