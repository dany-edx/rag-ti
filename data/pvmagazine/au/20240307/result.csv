With both the size and number of these deals expanding, power purchase agreements (PPAs) are shaping as a major driver for large-scale PV in the coming years.
“Looking at the [emissions reduction] targets of the utilities, some of the industrials, and where they need to get to by 2030 there will be offtake agreements,” says David Dixon, a Sydney based senior analyst with Rystad Energy.
Dixon points to new data centres, in places like Sydney, as adding sizeable new electricity load, that can be supplied by large-scale solar.
Indeed, tech giants like Google, Apple, and Meta (formerly Facebook) have been drivers of utility scale PV deployment by virtue of the large PPAs they have signed.
On Feb. 7, Amazon signed a 125 MW PPA with Singapore-based Vena Energy for a project located in Wandoan, which is approximately 350km north east of Brisbane.
By virtue of the PPA, the project received a new name – the Amazon Solar Project Australia. It will remain owned by Vena. The duration of the PPA is confidential. The solar project is part of the larger Wandoan South Project – which comprises 650 MW of solar and is set to be coupled with 450 MW of battery energy storage.
“Amazon is on a path to power our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, and we’re proud to deliver new solar and wind projects in Australia, driving strong sustainability outcomes for our customers and local communities,” said Ken Haig, head of energy and environment policy, Asia Pacific and Japan at Amazon Web Services. He noted that Amazon has invested “billions” in Australia.
The 125 MW “Amazon” solar project deploys Risen Modules, central inverters from Power Electronics, and single-axis trackers from PV Hardware. A spokesperson from Vena concurred that PPAs with companies such as Amazon play an important role in solar project’s reaching financial close.
“Based on our experience, securing an offtake agreement with a creditworthy and renowned counterparty like Amazon significantly enhances a project’s appeal to debt capital, due to the enhanced financial stability and reduced risk profile such an agreement brings to the project,” the Vena spokesperson explained.
“When we think about whether a project gets to financial close, we only think about three things: grid, having a spot on the grid is a big challenge in Australia; two is whether you have all of the approvals, but there are enough solar projects approved; and the third is revenue – if you don’t have that, particularly for solar, the bank is not going to lend you money,” said Dixon.
“Corporate PPAs do still come in.”
Dixon pointed to the 1.1 GW deal miner Rio Tinto signed with the Upper Calliope Solar Farm planned for the Gladstone region in Queensland. Construction on the project is set to begin in 2025 or 2026.
On 21 February 2024, Rio also signed a PPA to purchase 80% of the power generated by the massive, planned 1.4 GW Bungaban wind energy project.
Investment bank Macquarie noted that Rio is looking to procure 4 GW of solar and wind power for its operations, in particular for “repowering its aluminium assets at Gladstone (Boyne Smelter, Yurwin Alumina Refinery and Queensland Alumina Refinery) with green electricity.”
Between the major miners and tech companies, PPAs are proving a significant driver of large-scale renewable deployment in Australia, during a period in which price cannibalisation is causing significant headwinds.
In Sydney alone, Rystad charts 600 MW of new electricity load from data centres that is coming online.
“Even though there are cheap [wholesale electricity] prices in the middle of the day, there are new, large industrial loads – and a good example is data centres and the aluminium smelters,” said Dixon.

1,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/07/clean-energy-manufacturing-sector-urged-to-get-a-move-on/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,FINANCE,INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,2024-03-07,Clean energy manufacturing sector urged to get a move on,"Data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows the world added nearly 510 GW of renewable energy capacity in 2023 – a 50% increase on 2022. The agency has predicted that global renewable capacity will reach 7,300 GW by 2028, driving massive demand for of clean energy technologies including solar panels, wind turbines, and battery energy storage systems.
A panel of industry experts convened on day one of the Smart Energy Expo in Sydney acknowledged the scale of the transition from coal-dominated to renewables-dominated generation presents enormous opportunities for an Australian manufacturing industry.
Tindo Solar Chief Executive Richard Petterson however said it is critical Australia moves quickly to ensure it shares in the benefits of the energy transition by “creating hundreds of jobs and a domestic renewables manufacturing industry.”
“There’s a lot of talk about what the country should do,” he said. “But everyone else is getting on with it. Anyone that’s really in this race is already halfway down the track. We’re the last cab off the rank.”
Tindo earlier this year revealed it intends to expand its solar energy manufacturing capacity, announcing plans to build a $100 million factory that would deliver a six-fold increase in its capacity.
The new plant, likely to be located on the east coast of Australia, is expected to commence production in 2025 and be able to manufacture about 2.5 million panels per year – equivalent to approximately 1 GW of capacity per annum.
The existing Tindo manufacturing facility at Mawson Lakes in northern Adelaide has an annual capacity of 360,000 panels, equivalent to 150 MW per year.

Petterson believes the establishment of a gigascale facility, and the associated demand for components, will help build up and support a local supply chain.
“If we get the conditions right, if the government gets the conditions right, 1 GW should be large enough to start drawing a supply chain that makes a bit of a difference,” he said.
“We’ll start to stimulate other parts of our supply chain. At the moment, our draw through is quite small.”
The chief commercial officer at Australian solar innovator SunDrive, Dr Maia Schweizer, told the audience it will take “time, commitment and grit” for Australia to establish a clean energy manufacturing sector of note.
Schweizer said Australia’s ambition to build a solar manufacturing industry is battling a 10c to 15c per Watt headwind relative to Chinese products, a disadvantage driven mostly by labour costs and the higher capital cost of facilities but added there is reason to be optimistic.
“We’ve done modelling that shows with greater automation, with cheap, plentiful green energy, and by translating [Australia’s] intellectual legacy into the commercialization of technology, we think we can close the gap in the coming decade,” she said.

Schweizer listed three objectives she believes are necessary for the development of a domestic clean energy manufacturing sector.
“The first is to buy Australian,” she said. “Give Australian manufacturers some sense that they can compete for a market.”
“The second thing is to help bridge the structural headwinds.”
“While encouraging the innovation and automation and the large-scale deployment of low-cost green power will inevitably turn those headwinds into tailwinds, we do need support until that happens and that could be a five-to-10-year journey.”
Schweizer’s third objective is to play to the nation’s intellectual strength, pointing to the work of Professor Martin Green, who is widely considered the father of PV, having led the research team at the University of New South Wales that took PV out of the lab and into the market.
“Australia is a world-renowned source of solar excellence, so let’s try to keep some of that here,” Schweizer said.
SunDrive’s own manufacturing ambitions remain on track with the Sydney-based startup opening a 20 MW pilot line at its nearly 5,000 square metre facility at Kurnell.
Schweizer said the next step for the company, which successfully replaced the silver traditionally used in solar cells with copper, is to “build a commercial-scale facility to bring hundreds of MW a year of our world-leading solar cells to the market from mid-2025.”

2,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/07/smart-energy-expo-8-8kg-glass-free-module-launched-by-chinas-aiko/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,2024-03-07,Smart Energy Expo: 8.8kg glass-free module launched by China’s Aiko,"Aiko’s ‘Air Series’ is now open for orders, but has not yet been formally certified on the Clean Energy Council’s approved modules list. A representative for the company told pv magazine Australia that it expected full listing within the next two months.
The framed module uses high chemical plastic instead of customary, heavy solar glass. This reduces the module’s output slightly – with a representative saying it is a reduction of around 10V compared to the glass module version. Even with the reduction, the series boasts a peak power output of 450W.
It is 1758mm x 1137mm and has a 25mm frame. Compared to other lightweight modules designed for low load bearing roofs, like from company Sunman, Aiko’s design includes a frame. This increases reliability, the representative said, as without a frame the junction box must sit in front of the module, bringing weathering risks. It is worth noting the module’s product warranty sits on the lower end of the solar spectrum at 12 years, though its product warranty aligns with industry norms at 25 years. 
Aiko is a relative newcomer to the market, launching in Australia at the 2023 All Energy expo in Melbourne. The Shanghai-based manufacturer was founded back in 2009, starting out specialising in solar cell manufacturing before moving into full panel production more recently. Today, it is distributed in Australia through Solar Juice, AC Warehouse and Sole Distribution.
The company was not able to provide pricing information on its Air Series in Australia, but noted the series is more expensive than its comparable glass modules.
Aiko’s Air Series has already been introduced to the European market, the Aiko representative said.
On display at the Smart Energy Expo was also Aiko’s Neostar 2P, part of its ABC line, which stands for All Back Contact (ABC). The module boasts partial shading optimisation when compared to mainstream TOPCon modules.
It is the second generation from Aiko’s Neostar range, with module output between 450W to 470W. The panels are 21.5 kg.

3,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/07/smart-energy-expo-chelion-rolls-out-latest-residential-energy-storage-system/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,2024-03-07,Smart Energy Expo: Chelion rolls out latest residential energy storage system,"Chelion Australia said the first shipment of its new all-in-one residential solar power storage solution arrived in the country late last month and the first of those units have now been installed.
“This has already started rolling out,” Chelion Business Development Manager Isaac Turner said at the Smart Energy Expo in Sydney.
“Our first container came in about three weeks ago and we maybe have 20 units left. The next container is coming in June.”
Chelion said the iHome-S-HD1H01 series is modular, lithium iron phosphate DC/AC coupled storage solution that offers flexible expansion in 5 kWh modules up to 40 kWh.
The company said each module has a built-in DC/DC converter that is “pre-optimised to perform at the highest level.” The systems come equipped with internal smart metering and a powerful energy management system. The batteries have a round-trip efficiency of about 90% and offer a number of operational modes, including self-consumption, off-grid, energy scheduling and back-up power of up to 7.8 kW.
Chelion said the systems are easily stackable, weighing it at 140 kilograms and measuring 800 mm x 1,235 mm x 200 mm. The system, which comes with a 10-year warranty, can be floor or wall mounted.
The new iHome offering is part of a growing list of storage solutions offered by the Brisbane-based Chelion Australia.
It is also supplying storage solutions for the commercial market, including the Matrix Ares and Zeus series. The Ares is a 163 kWh all-in-one unit, with integrated HVAC, while the Zeus is a liquid-cooled 301 kWh system.
Chelion said the Zeus offers “almost unlimited expandability” for clients with demanding peak-load or very-high efficiency AC output requirements.

4,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/07/cec-calls-for-federal-residential-battery-subsidy/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",JONATHAN GIFFORD,2024-03-07,CEC calls for federal residential battery subsidy,"With rooftop PV installations going from strength to strength, calls are mounting for the federal government to replicate the measures taken by some states in supporting residential battery energy storage uptake.
Distributed batteries would undoubtedly support continuing rooftop PV uptake and effectively shift rooftop solar generation from midday, when it is increasingly flooding grids, to meet evening peak demand. It would also facilitate ongoing rooftop PV uptake for homeowners, addressing equity issues.
“A national [residential battery] scheme is now needed to maximise the benefits of orchestrated home batteries for consumers and this has to be designed to deliver the highest quality products and meet strong safety standards,” said the CEC’s director of distributed energy, Con Hristodoulidis, in a statement.
The CEC is proposing an incentive of up to $6500 for each household to install a residential battery alongside rooftop solar.
The clean energy organisation pointed to modelling from consultancy Oakley Greenwood that households with a battery could save $900 annually on power bills under such a program. When batteries are “orchestrated” into a virtual power plant, or similar, those savings could increase to $1150 a year.
On an electricity system level, net savings of $190 million would be delivered by orchestrated residential batteries – the CEC-sponsored study concluded.
The CEC has previously published modelling showing that, as far back as 2021, solar and energy storage was already cheaper than gas peaker plans in meeting peak electricity demand periods.
“Orchestrated residential batteries have the added advantage of being able to trade electricity with the grid at optimal times, increasing consumer savings and supporting the broader energy system,” the CEC argued.
The CEC is far from being alone in its calls to bolster residential battery deployment. Tristan Edis, the director of analysis and advisory at Green Energy Markets has been calling for the SRES program to be reformed to support household battery uptake. With rooftop solar already affordable, STCs would be better directed at much-needed batteries, so the argument goes.
“If you want a politically popular program that is going to achieve meaningful scale and rollout and will have enough political support you have to go households,” Edis told pv magazine Australia. “The households are paying through the nose for their batteries,” he added.
With battery cell prices coming down, Edis said that residential battery price declines are likely coming. With scale, battery installations could rapidly increase – as has been see in countries like Germany and Italy.
According to the researchers at the HTW Berlin University of Applied Sciences, 79% of household solar systems were installed alongside a battery in 2023. This amounted to some 4.6 GWh of capacity.
With a residential solar-plus-storage system installed, households were able to reach 70% self-sufficiency, the HTW researchers found. The average rooftop system was 8.4 kWp, alongside a 7.3kWh battery in Germany in 2023.
There are some state-based programs currently in operation. On Feb. 12, the Queensland government opened its residential battery rebate program. The Victorian government is also providing interest-free loans for home batteries.
