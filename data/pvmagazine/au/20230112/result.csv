The decision has cast a shadow over the future of the Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPowerLink) project but Northern Territory (NT) Acting Chief Minister Nicole Manison said she remains confident the venture will go ahead.
Manison said she had been briefed about Sun Cable’s collapse shortly before it was announced publicly and was given “big assurances” about the future of the project which would export solar power from the Australian outback to Singapore via a submarine transmission link.
“They’re going through some shareholder issues and they are resolving them, and they are anticipating they are going to resolve them very swiftly and get on with business,” she said.
“They are confident they will be out of the voluntary administration process swiftly and that we can have confidence in the future of this fantastic project.”
Manison’s sentiments were echoed by Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen who said he had been “speaking to very senior people in Sun Cable over the last 24 hours” and remained “very upbeat and excited” about the company’s future.
“This is primarily a commercial decision about structure and the way forward,” Bowen continued. “It doesn’t represent … any sort of lack of faith in the future of Sun Cable. It’s a commercial change of structure.”
“Sun Cable has enormous potential for Australia as a renewable energy export powerhouse.”

The project proposal comprises building up to 20 GW of solar and 42 GWh of energy storage in northern Australia and the world’s longest undersea cable to deliver power to Singapore, and eventually, Indonesia. Sun Cable had hoped to begin construction in 2024 and was aiming to be providing power to Darwin in 2027 and Singapore in 2029.
Those ambitions are now in jeopardy with Sun Cable confirming FTI Consulting has been appointed to lead the voluntary administration process “after consensus on the future direction and funding structure of the company could not be achieved.”
A dispute about project financing between the company’s two main backers, Australian billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest, is understood to be behind the move.
Cannon-Brookes, who was appointed chairman of Sun Cable in October, said he is confident the project would go ahead and indicated he was continuing to support the venture
“I fully back this ambition and the team, and look forward to supporting the company’s next chapter,” he said in a company statement.

The statement offered no comment from Forrest’s privately owned Squadron Energy, Sun Cable’s other major stakeholder.
Sun Cable said the administrators will now “work with the company’s management team and key stakeholders to determine appropriate next steps for the business.”
Sun Cable expects this process will “involve a process to seek expressions of interest for either a recapitalisation or sale of the business”, unlocking a “path forward for the company to access additional capital for continued development” of its marquee project.
Sun Cable founder and Chief Executive Officer David Griffin said the project “remains well placed for completion.”
“As we have progressed our work, the demand for delivering reliable, dispatchable 24/7 renewable energy in the NT and the region has risen materially,” he said. “Sun Cable looks forward to developing and operating the projects to meet this demand.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/12/acen-australia-plans-to-accelerate-rollout-of-renewables-portfolio/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,PHILIPPINES",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 12, 2023",ACEN Australia plans to accelerate rollout of renewables portfolio,"The Australian arm of Philippines-based energy company ACEN Corporation has signed a green term-loan facility with a syndicate of major international banks worth $277 million as part of its ambition to raise more than $600 million to help grow its renewables capacity in Australia and the broader Asia-Pacific region to 20 GW by 2030.
ACEN, which claims to already have approximately 4,000 MW of attributable capacity in the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, India and Australia, said the new loan facility will provide capital financing to expand ACEN Australia’s renewable energy portfolio, which is expected to be a significant contributor to the company’s renewables ambitions.
A subsidiary of the Philippines-based Ayala Corporation conglomerate, ACEN said it has more than 1.5 GW of projects across New South Wales (NSW), Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia “under construction or at an advanced stage of development” and the new loan will allow it to advance those projects.
“The funds will be allocated to finance the development and construction of ACEN’s project pipeline in Australia encompassing solar, wind, battery storage, pumped hydro power and energy storage,” the company said in a statement.
The first of these projects, the New England Solar Farm, is expected to be in operation by the middle of 2023 after the project, being developed near Uralla in northern NSW, was last month granted formal registration to send power to the National Electricity Market (NEM).
ACEN said energy production from the 400 MW first stage of the New England Solar Farm is now underway after the project generated and delivered 5 MW of clean renewable energy into the NEM.

Construction of the first stage of the solar farm and 50 MW/50 MWh battery energy storage system commenced in early 2022. The estimated $768 million project will eventually see a 720 MW solar farm co-located with battery energy storage. There is potential for the energy storage system to be scaled up to 200 MW/400 MWh.
The company has also commenced construction of the 400 MW Stubbo Solar Farm and associated 200 MW/200 MWh battery energy storage project being developed near Dubbo in the NSW central west.
ACEN Australia this week awarded the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract to PCL Construction with notice to proceed already having been issued.
ACEN Australia Construction Manager Tim Greenaway said all major contracts are now in place, including the connection agreement with infrastructure service provider Lumea and the execution of PV module supply contracts.
“It is exciting to finalise the EPC with PCL Construction for the development of the Stubbo Solar project,” he said. “We look forward to working with them over the next several years to deliver the project and help support the transition to a low emission generation supply in NSW.”

Other projects in the company’s Australian portfolio include the proposed 600 MW Birriwa solar farm and battery project also in NSW, a share in the 250 MW Baroota pumped hydro and 300 MW Bridle Track solar projects in South Australia, and the 160 MW Axedale Solar Farm in Victoria, which may also come to include a battery energy storage system. ACEN is also pursuing wind projects in NSW and Tasmania.
The new loan facility is backed by the Bank of China (BOC) in Manila and Hong Kong, CTBC Bank in Manila and Singapore, and Standard Chartered Bank in Australia. ACEN said Bank of China was the green loan structuring bank, while Commonwealth Bank of Australia served as the agent for the loan facility.
ACEN Australia Chief Executive Officer Anton Rohner said the loan facility is a follow on from several transactions completed last year.
“This syndicated green term loan facility continues to build on the funding secured at the end of last year, and will be mobilised into our Australian portfolio,” he said. ‘With Stubbo 520 MWdc project reaching notice to proceed late in 2022, ACEN continues on the journey in decarbonising Australia. It is exciting to work with quality financial institutions, and the appetite for quality investments is real.”
In August 2022, ACEN Australia executed a $100 million loan facility with DBS Bank Australia. The following month, ACEN executed an agreement with the Sydney branch of global financial group MUFG for an up to $140 million loan facility and secured a $75 million green debt facility with the Australian government-owned Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC).

Held biennially since 2004, the IREC is one of the world’s leading renewable energy events and Clean Energy Council (CEC) Chief Executive Officer Kane Thornton said the selection of Adelaide as the host of IREC 2024 is well-deserved recognition of Australia’s status as an emerging clean energy superpower.
“The Australian renewable energy industry is globally renowned for its clean energy transition, including leading the world in per capita rooftop solar installations and the rapid development of an emerging clean hydrogen export industry,” he said.
“South Australia is at the forefront of this transition, with the state the only gigawatt-scale grid in the world that regularly produces enough wind and solar power to meet all its energy needs.”
“Hosting IREC 2024 in Adelaide presents a fantastic opportunity to not only showcase the Australian renewable energy industry to the world but also provides a practical demonstration of the immense possibilities of a clean energy future.”
The Adelaide conference, to be held on 7-11 April 2024, will be the first time the IREC has been held in the Oceania region.
Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen said a key part of the Adelaide conference will be to consult with and involve Australia’s First Nations peoples in deploying clean energy projects, strengthening the government’s commitment to ensure they are included and benefit from the transition to renewables.
“The future of energy in Australia and the world is renewable and sharing the latest knowledge with international partners and experts will help make that vision a reality,” he said.
“Australia is on the path to becoming a renewable energy superpower. Forums like IREC will help us continue to work with global partners, the Pacific and First Nations to address key challenges in renewable energy and find the best path to a clean energy future for all.”
Organised by the France-headquartered REN21 (the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century), IREC has been held biennially since 2004, with previous conferences held in South Korea, the US, China, and this year in Madrid, Spain.

Initially launched in 2016, the $25 million program was designed to stimulate the ACT’s battery energy storage marketplace and improve access for Canberrans to install a battery.
“The Next Gen program was launched at a time when energy storage technology was still in its infancy, so the goal of the program was to stimulate a marketplace where Canberrans could access batteries more easily and more affordably,” ACT Energy Minister Shane Rattenbury said.
“The program has been an overwhelming success, with our local industry growing from four to over 24 battery installers operating in the ACT, and with the ACT now having one of the highest domestic battery densities not only in Australia but in the world.”
Rattenbury said that over the past seven years, the program has provided rebates for more than 5,000 homes and businesses to install a battery, reaching the target set out at the program’s inception.
Now that the target has been achieved, the Next Gen program is to be wound down with no new rebate applications accepted while all currently approved applications will need to have batteries installed by 31 March 2023 to access the rebate.
Rattenbury said the government will work with battery installers on any “outstanding installations to ensure an appropriate transition following this date.”
While the Next Gen program is being wound up, Rattenbury said households can continue to access ACT government support through its Sustainable Household Scheme, which provides homeowners with access to zero-interest loans to make sustainable upgrades to their homes, and businesses can access tailored advice and rebates through the Business Energy and Water program.
“We encourage people to continue to shop around for energy storage solutions for their homes,” he said. “Increasing energy storage remains a key priority to maintain a stable and reliable electricity system as we continue to electrify our city.”
To achieve this goal, in addition to encouraging household batteries, the ACT government is also investing in grid-scale storage with funding allocated in the 2022-23 Budget to advance the Big Canberra Battery project which is to provide at least 250 MW of large-scale battery energy storage.
The Big Canberra Battery project is in addition to 100 MW/200 MWh Capital Battery being developed in the ACT by French renewables giant Neoen.

The portfolio includes the 110 MWp Moura Solar Farm being developed near the town of the same name in central Queensland. Mytilineos said construction of the solar farm has already been completed and the asset is now undergoing hold-point testing and expected to begin generating power in 2023.
Also included in the portfolio is the 53 MWp Kingaroy Solar Farm, also in Queensland, and the 75 MWp Wyalong plant being developed in the NSW Riverina region. The company said construction of the Wyalong Solar Farm is “substantially progressed” with the project expected to be completed in the first half of this year. Early works have begun on the Kingaroy project with main works expected to be carried out during 2023.
The financing package, from backers ANZ and Westpac, is structured as a combination of term facility, construction facility and ancillary facilities totalling $234 million (USD 156 million).
Mytilineos Renewables Executive Director Nikos Papapetrou said the new funding will enable additional projects to be financed and constructed in 2023 and beyond, further consolidating the company’s position in the wider Australian and Pacific market.
“Australia is a key market for Mytilineos’ global renewables development strategy, extending across the Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Latin America regions,” he said. “We are pleased with the trust given to the company and to our vision in the region and we look forward to many more successful financings for our future projects”.
According to the company, its Australian portfolio totals 400 MW and is part of a worldwide pipeline of solar and energy storage projects under various stages of development that exceeds 4 GW.

Once completed, the Moura, Kingaroy and Wyalong solar farms are expected to produce about 500 GWh of renewable energy annually.
Mytilineos said the majority of that power has already been sold in a series of long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). More than half of the output of the Moura Solar Farm has been allocated through a long-term PPA with Queensland government-owned generator CS Energy while Smartest Energy, an electricity retailer owned by Japanese investment company Marubeni, has an offtake agreement in place for power produced at the Kingaroy installation. Publicly owned telecommunications company NBN Co has inked a deal to acquire about half of the output from the Wyalong Solar Farm.
This is Mytilineos’ second project financing in Australia, having reached financial close on three 40 MWp solar farms in NSW in late 2021.
ANZ Corporate Finance Executive Director Mark Clover said Mytilineos’ expansion in Australia is “encouraging” for the renewable energy market and aligns with the bank’s goal of funding and facilitating $100 billion in sustainable solutions by 2030.

Swiping through any number of smartphone applications, a homeowner can see the throughput power coming in from his or her rooftop solar array during the afternoon while their EV charges in the garage or fills a battery storage system.  This week, Schneider Electric unveiled the Schneider Home platform, the first consumer energy management system (EMS) that integrates all energy endpoints and household appliances in one interface that can be monitored via a single smartphone application.
The Schneider Home system was released a day before the kick off of the 2023 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) conference, taking place January 5 through 8 in Las Vegas, where the company has been recognised as a 2023 Innovation Award Honoree for the new platform.
The residential platform allows users to not only monitor the energy consumption of household appliances, it also allows users to prioritise power during outages to extend available back-up power during power outages to appliances such as the refrigerator or freezer.
At the utility level, the residential EMS platform provides additional energy cost savings by allowing for the enrolment in utility programs such as net metering. It can also help qualify the homeowner for tax incentives such as the solar investment tax credit for installing  solar and storage solutions.
In contrast to existing solutions that require individual apps and hardware, Schneider Electric has eliminated the complexity for homeowners by automating energy production, storage, measurement and control. Recognised by CES, Schneider Home’s sleek styling and integrated approach mark a new age of home energy management solutions.
“Homeowners are now able to produce their own energy and seamlessly switch between power sources to optimise cost,”  said Nadege Petit, executive vice president of innovation at Schneider.
The Schneider Home platform consists of five home components that integrate energy resources and digital capabilities, including:
For an existing home, Schneider Electric reports that it makes the most sense when a customer needs to make updates to their electrical system, for example, if they are adding a new technology such as an EV and charging system. The residential system includes the solar inverter, but system installation would require other aspects of the solar system such as wire harnessing and electrical equipment to be provided separately by an electrician or EPC contractor, a company spokesman told pv magazine USA.
Schneider Electric brings together disparate home energy technologies into an integrated, open, and streamlined system – all controlled by a single app with unique capabilities, including:
“Choice, control, convenience – these are the characteristics that consumers are looking for in every experience. What better or more meaningful place to deliver that than in their own homes?,” said Jaser Faruq, senior vice president of innovation and energy storage at Schneider. “We took the opportunity to reimagine home energy placing the customer at the centre, then designing a full-featured, integrated system around their needs and paired with an intuitive app to simplify its operation.”
Faruq joined Schneider Electric in September 2021 to head up the Schneider Home platform after a six-year tenure at Tesla, where he was head of business operations for the EV manufacturer’s Residential Energy business, as well as solar roof growth and operations lead manager.
Over the last two years, Schneider Electric has been on a corporate acquisition spree for products that comprise many core solutions found in the Schneider Home platform, such as EV Connect, Qmerit, Zeigo, EnergySage and AutoGrid Holdings, whose technologies include residential EV charging, climate-technology data, and distributed energy resources integration.  In May 2021, the energy solutions provider launched a retail website to sell distributed resources such as solar and energy storage products.
Paris-based Schneider Electric is a Fortune Global 500 company formed in 1836 as a steel, mining and electrical service company.  From 1981 through 1997, the company divested out of the steel, mining and shipbuilding markets to become a full-service electric solutions provider, primarily through acquisitions.
The company currently trades at EUR 139.80 ($217) per share, with an USD 84.5 billion ($122.5b) market capitalisation.
