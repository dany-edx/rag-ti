Industrial planning is easy to get wrong and difficult to get right. But Australia has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to observe the strengths of other nations’ approaches, and to foster industrial collaboration between the private and public sectors in supporting the critical industries that will set us up for long-term success in our energy system.
Thankfully, state and federal governments are on the right path, and with some additional policy measures Australia can enjoy a renewables manufacturing renaissance that delivers jobs and growth while also achieving emissions reduction targets and sovereign capability in a renewable energy system.
At Tindo Solar, Australia’s only manufacturer of solar panels, we are at the coal – or panel – face. We’ve managed to set up a successful manufacturing business, with minimal government support, in the face of intense competition from overseas manufacturers which have benefitted from extensive policy and taxpayer backing.
This unique experience has given us hope that manufacturing renewables hardware at scale in this country is not only possible, but is an economic, environmental and ethical imperative.
Economically, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates 1,300 manufacturing jobs could be created for each gigawatt of solar PV production capacity. Environmentally, locally made goods incur less freight carbon miles and production can be powered by renewable sources. And from an ethical perspective, locally made goods provide much better visibility of labour and environmental practices in the supply chain, a key risk in the renewables industry.
Geopolitics also plays its part. The nations trying to incentivise renewables manufacturing believe it is critical to have sovereign capability in building wind, solar and battery hardware. Achieving an 82% Australian renewable grid by 2030 is a noble goal, but is there a way to do it where Australia enjoys more benefits? And what can be done to expedite the process at lowest cost to taxpayers?
The first step is getting manufacturing capacity up and running. Doing this requires significant finance. The Commonwealth government’s National Reconstruction Fund (NRF), as well as existing entities such as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), provide an ideal mechanism for securing the upfront capital required to build and kit out factories. With their backing, commercial lenders are also more comfortable providing finance, so initiatives like the NRF are ideal for getting projects off the ground. Other initiatives being championed by governments include New South Wales’ Net Zero Plan Stage 1, and Queensland’s Energy and Jobs Plan. All these government-led initiatives help to reduce the initial development costs and risks, and since many of the interventions offer debt or equity, taxpayers can recoup their investment.
However, kickstarting an industry is one thing; how do we build a sustainable one? A domestic industry where the benefits outweigh the low-cost import model?
At Tindo Solar we believe this question is answered by – in the case of solar panel manufacturing – creating a manufacturing facility of at least 1 GW of output per year. That equals about 7,000 rooftop panels per day, or one-third of the daily target that Australian Energy Minister Chris Bowen has signalled.
A 1 GW facility creates enough buying power and scale-efficiency that we could bring down the import/domestic price delta by around 70%. When the price delta is compressed to this point, domestically-made panels become competitive because of their high-quality, longer life and their lower carbon miles which could also be supported by a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.
Secondly, 1 GW of panel output incentivises other domestic manufacturers – for example, of glass, frames, solar cells and back sheet – to justify building new production based on the improved economic scale delivered by the 1 GW solar panel production.
Low-cost finance gets us some of the way to making a domestic industry viable. However, there is a missing piece; targeted short-term price support as the industry scales.
Government does not have to go into ‘subsidy’ mode to address this. We have the support of developers and other customers who are keen to use our panels, because they more fully satisfy their ESG goals and it helps de-risk their own projects because local supply removes the volatility of freight logistics and currency fluctuation.
However, the reality of low-cost imports has to be acknowledged. We are seeing this in the US, India and Europe, all of whom are prepared to support local renewables manufacturing with a variety of mechanisms.
The American IRA is throwing huge sums at manufacturers via a range of subsidies. Australia could be smarter, doing it in a more targeted and efficient way that achieves similar outcomes. The Commonwealth Government has already implemented a ‘production credit’ as part of its Hydrogen Headstart program in which applicants nominate value “that should represent the difference between the expected sales price to each offtaker and the applicant cost of production.”
A similar mechanism, with an Australia-made stipulation, would work well in the solar panel manufacturing industry and stimulate the whole supply chain. As the IEA has modelled, there are 1,300 Australian jobs in the offing for every 1 GW of solar panels made domestically. We believe it’s time for Australia’s governments to invest in domestic manufacturing so we can turn our most abundant resource – sunlight – into a sovereign energy capability.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/17/climate-capital-achieves-tasmanian-first-with-large-scale-solar/,"HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,TASMANIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 17, 2024",Climate Capital achieves Tasmanian first with large-scale solar,"Renewable energy company Climate Capital has confirmed that the 4.95 MW Bell Bay Solar Farm, the first operational utility scale solar facility in Tasmania, has been exporting at full capacity since late last month.
Located on a 13-hectare site at George Town, which neighbours Bell Bay near Launceston in the state’s north, the estimated $8 million (USD 5.3 million) project comprises about 16,000 solar panels and is expected to generate enough renewable electricity to power the equivalent of 1,000 homes.
Shane Bartel, chief executive officer of Hobart-headquartered Climate Capital, said the Bell Bay Solar Farm has been exporting at full capacity since late December after receiving official approval from Tasmanian government-owned transmission company TasNetworks.
“The approval is to export 4.95 MW. We’ve also got an import component to that of 5 MW and that is to support our incoming behind-the-meter customer,” he said.
Climate Capital has an agreement in place to supply renewable energy to Queensland company Line Hydrogen’s approved 7.6 MW George Town green hydrogen project planned for Bell Bay.
Bartel said Line Hydrogen to expected to commence construction of the green hydrogen project this year with a two-hectare site adjacent to the solar farm already set aside for facility which will produce up to 1,500 kilograms of green hydrogen daily for use in local industries, including transport and mining.
The Bell Bay Solar Farm is the largest operational PV project in Tasmania but it is not expected to hold that mantle for long with a string of other utility-scale projects in the pipeline.
Among them is the proposed 288 MW Northern Midlands Solar Farm being developed by clean energy startup TasRex near the town of Cressy, about 80 kilometres south of Bell Bay.
Climate Capital is also pursuing more solar projects in the island state with Bartel revealing the company is currently working on “two or three” other projects with public announcements likely to come later this year.
Bartel said the company’s Tasmanian projects are part of a $500 million pipeline with a combined generation capacity of more than 800 MW that Climate Capital is progressing throughout Australia.
“A lot of the projects are sub-5 MW but there are some larger ones as well between 20 and 100 MW,” he said.
The company also has an operational portfolio of almost 15 MW, including the 2.3 MW Boonanaring Solar Farm in Western Australia and the 5 MW Tregalana Solar Project in South Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/17/amp-energy-buys-time-for-south-australian-green-hydrogen-project/,"HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",PV MAGAZINE,"JANUARY 17, 2024",Amp Energy buys time for South Australian green hydrogen project,"Amp Energy has secured a three-month extension to its Strategic Framework Agreement with Iron Road that the company expects will provide it with the time required to finalise and execute transaction documents associated with the next phase of the proposed Cape Hardy green hydrogen and ammonia project in South Australia.
In April 2023, Amp won the tender and commenced a nine-month exclusivity period to develop and build an electrolyser and associated ammonia and green hydrogen production facility at Cape Hardy, north of Tumby Bay on South Australia’s Eyre Peninsula. The parties have now extended that period, and in exchange Amp has waived its right to receive a refund of one-third of the $1.5 million (USD 690,000) it paid for the exclusivity agreement.
Amp said the Cape Hardy Green Hydrogen Project will initially comprise 1 GW of electrolyser capacity, growing to 5 GW and capable of producing more than 5 million tons of green ammonia a year. The project’s second stage will see a doubling of this capacity to 10 GW. At full capacity, renewables-based ammonia production is expected to approach 10 million tonnes per annum.
The project will cover approximately one third of the 1,200-hectare site at Cape Hardy controlled by Iron Road, which is concurrently developing a multi-billion-dollar iron export and deep-sea port development project at the site.
While no timeline has been provided for the Cape Hardy project, Amp said it is progressing well with two leading global engineering firms having studied and reviewed the project ahead of it entering the pre–Front-End Engineering Design (pre-FEED) stage.
Amp said preliminary master planning of the Cape Hardy precinct incorporating electrolyser supply, water desalination, ammonia plant and ancillaries has already been completed and it is continuing advanced discussions with numerous Eyre Peninsula landowners, third party energy developers and transmission network specialists, to secure and transmit renewable energy supply to drive lowest cost of ammonia for domestic and export off-take.
“We have seen a flight to quality from global strategic partners who are looking to partner with projects of scale and we believe the Cape Hardy Green Hydrogen project is strategically well positioned as one of Australia’s flagship hydrogen projects,” Amp President and founder Paul Ezekiel said.
Amp said indicative economic analysis supports an unsubsidised levelised cost of hydrogen of approximately $4.50 (USD 3) per kilogram of hydrogen. This equates to a mid $900 (USD 600) per tonne levelised cost of green ammonia.
“This costing is consistent with the stage of the project and is subject to ongoing design and economic optimisation, that will reflect the evolving commercial and market landscape,” the company said.
South Australian Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis said the strong progress achieved by the Cape Hardy Green Hydrogen project reflects the momentum of the state’s emerging hydrogen industry.
“In addition to creating thousands of jobs for South Australians, projects like this facility at Cape Hardy contribute to our government’s net zero goals and strengthen the state’s economy,” he said. “Renewable hydrogen has an important role to play as the world transitions to a decarbonised future and South Australia is ideally positioned to capitalise on this opportunity.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/17/governments-unite-with-206-million-clean-energy-initiative/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",PV MAGAZINE,"JANUARY 17, 2024",Governments unite with $206 million clean energy initiative,"More than 30,000 homes are in line for a share of a $206 million funding package with the Commonwealth and New South Wales (NSW) governments announcing the funding will be used to improve energy efficiency and expanding access to solar power.
“We want all Australians to have access to cleaner, cheaper energy,” Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said. “This $206 million package will mean 30,000 households across NSW will be able to access upgrades that will make their homes more energy efficient.”
As part of the joint initiative, more than 24,000 social housing properties in the state will be eligible for grants to deliver renewable energy solutions, including rooftop solar and hot water systems.
The grants worth a total of $175 million over four years will be jointly funded by the NSW and Commonwealth governments.
The federal government is also investing $30 million to help apartment residents and low-income households in NSW access solar energy by subsidising rooftop solar installations and providing grants to access a share of a ‘solar garden community energy plot.
The Solar Banks initiative will deliver rebates of up to 50% of rooftop solar installation costs for multi-unit dwellings while some residents who can’t afford onsite rooftop solar could be eligible for a subsidy to purchase an offsite ‘solar garden’ portion of a large-scale solar farm under the deal.
NSW Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said the Solar Banks program will support more than 10,000 apartment dwellers and renters who have traditionally been locked out of owning solar.
“By partnering with the Commonwealth, we will be able to roll out a series of vital upgrades and initiatives that will deliver bill savings for low-income earners, make homes more comfortable to live in and reduce carbon emissions,” she said.
Cameron Knox, Chief Executive Officer of Australian solar technology company Allume Energy, said the Solar Banks scheme is an “absolute boon for NSW residents,” noting that if it follows the template of other jurisdictions like Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), it will halve the average rooftop solar install cost of $3,500-$4,000 per apartment, depending on how big the building is.
“This is something that councils have been crying out for,” Knox said. “They have been trying to accelerate the electrification and broader energy efficiency improvement of apartments by arming residents with knowledge and tools, but without the funding support to facilitate change they have been hamstrung.”
Knox said he expects the state and federal government funding assistance will catalyse the approach to retrofitting and modernising strata buildings nationally.
“The really good news for apartment dwellers in NSW eager to utilise this scheme to reduce their carbon footprint, is that they live in the easiest state to push these types of improvements through,” he said.
In addition to the energy upgrades and solar bank initiatives, a further $1 million will be invested in as yet identified community renewable energy projects on the NSW Far South Coast.
