“Everyone has the right to share our best understanding of physical reality,” says the University of Western Australia’s Emeritus Professor David Blair, a winner of last year’s Prime Minister’s Prize for Science, who says children know they’re not being taught science topics relevant to their daily lives. 
Blair and one of three other joint winners of the PM’s award, Professor Susan Scott, a professor of quantum science at the Australian National University, are leading an international team of academics to arrest the decline of interest shown by students in science from about the age of 14, with a new seamless progression of learning — dubbed the Einstein-First Project — based around a book, Teaching Einsteinian Physics in Schools, and an accompanying confidence-building program for teachers.
The key to the program is bringing science into the present, with all we know about photons (cue photovoltaics), light, energy and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, demonstrated using cheap thrills such as Nerf guns, magnets in tennis balls and more sophisticated donated equipment such as real solar panels which are then used to power tools such as drills, LED lights and more.
“Most children have heard of black holes and E=mc2,” Blair told pv magazine Australia, but the school curriculum is still focused on 19th-century science, where time is absolute, geometry is Euclidean and mass does not change with energy. It’s no surprise, he says, that kids think school science is about old stuff.
In the 19th century people had already observed many scientific phenomena that preceded our current understanding of climate change. The new Einstein-First curriculum reveals that as early as 1848, people were astonished to discover that heat, or what they then called “calorific white rays” would not pass through carbon dioxide or methane. In 1896, in Sweden, Arrhenius predicted that if the CO2 in the atmosphere were to double, then the temperature of the earth would increase by about five degrees.
“This is basic physics,” says Blair, and you can understand why there could be climate scepticism when people don’t understand why tiny amounts of some atom or molecule in the atmosphere can have this effect.”
Understanding such concepts is key to our survival, and also to igniting children’s comprehension that leads to questioning and scientific exploration.
Blair’s group of scientists began by interviewing children to appreciate what turns them off science, and started also to tackle many teachers’ reluctance to bring physics into the classroom, by making it approachable and engaging.
“Einsteinian physics is imagined by most adults to be impossibly difficult, but young people easily accept the concepts,” says Blair. He adds that the belief propagated by the founder of educational theory, Jean Piaget, that children can’t understand conceptual things until about the age of 14 have been debunked.
Never mind that, “When Piaget was talking about it, atoms were still conceptual; now you can see them and see molecules using atomic force microscopes and other methods,” he says.
The modernising scientists have developed and trialled a program of activities based on analogies and physical models, in which 15 Western Australian schools have participated. Teachers are introduced to the program in small workshops, and PhD students make time to visit schools and help teachers lead children through the activities.
“One of the earliest things we teach kids is the principles of the photoelectric effect —  which Einstein discovered in 1905 — how photons can basically knock electrons out of metals,” a concept teachers can demonstrate by using bowls of ping-pong balls as electrons and Nerf-gun-propelled electrons to knock them out of the bowl.

Access Technology Group has so far donated solar panels to participating schools. “It’s not a solar toy, but a full-scale solar panel that has enough power to run a 12-Volt electric drill which we might then use to create heat through friction.” says Blair. “It’s at a level of tactile experience where you can feel the forces,” he adds.
Such real equipment, physical models and toys encourage students to discover concepts through whole-body involvement. The concepts are also encapsulated in little ditties — songs that young children love to recite. 
The program encourages children to tell the “stories of discovery, the overthrow of old ideas and the language of modern science”, says a flyer produced to help generate private funding that will allow the group to scale their Einstein-First program into online teacher workshops, learning modules and support.
UWA, ANU and Curtin Universities have participated in development of the program, with about $1.5 million in combined funding from the Australian Research Council and the Western Australian Government.
The launch of the teacher-enabling book Teaching Einsteinian Physics in Schools on Wednesday this week will also see the beginning of a quest for a further $1 million in private funds to create online teacher-training materials and videos needed to roll the new curriculum out Australia wide. 
The initiative is also seeking commitments to provide materials in kind — more solar panels, electric drills, fans and LED lights. 
“Solar energy is 100% connected to Einsteinian physics,” says Blair. A solar panel, even kept inside the classroom, gathers enough light to power an LED globe, “and it just triggers so much physics and discussion: You’re starting with photons, you’re making electrons, then you’re using the electrons to directly convert back into photons in the LED light — the same physics in reverse!” says Blair.
Teachers who have been using Einstein-First materials in the classroom and providing feedback to the course leaders on what works and what doesn’t, have reported incredible results.
Blair says one Year 7 teacher who teaches a class that includes children with Attention Deficit Disorder and some learning disabilities told him that all students became fully engaged with the activities, “disruption was rare”, and that during activities and in post-activity discussions, “students with learning difficulties are practically indistinguishable from mainstream students”.
A Year 3 teacher said the program “stretched” the students, and at the end of classes they were “using vocabulary and clearly understanding concepts that would normally not be introduced until high school”. 
Test scores bear out teachers’ personal experience of teaching using Einstein-First:

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/16/sa-greens-seek-to-reinstate-a-publicly-owned-electricity-system-based-on-renewables/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"AUGUST 16, 2021",SA Greens seek to reinstate a publicly owned electricity system — based on renewables,"Yesterday the South Australian Greens made their play for the state elections planned for 19 March 2022 by pledging to reverse privatisation of South Australia’s energy system, invest $8.7 billion over four years in more than 7 GW of publicly owned renewable energy and storage and set aside $2 billion of its investment to provide free solar and storage to 200,000 low-income households and renters.
The proposed social-justice-focused package, which also includes a huge increase in public housing and introducing free public transport, would be funded by substantial tax increases on mining companies operating in South Australia, big banks and property developers, that amount to a $6.9 billion kitty over four years.
Greens’ member of the South Australian Legislative Council, Robert Simms, launched the campaign, describing the privatisation of the state’s electricity system along with the the decline of public housing as “disastrous”.
“Since privatisation in 1999 electricity prices in South Australia have increased 216%,” the Greens assert in their plan, which is titled A bold vision for South Australia. 
The party’s pitch blames the move away from the publicly owned Electricity Trust of South Australia (ETSA) as the reason why South Australians pay the highest electricity prices in Australia, and calculates that its measures to bring electricity generation, retailing and network provision back into public hands.
The revived ETSA, with a mandate to run at cost, and not for profit — would reduce the average energy bill of constituents by $409 per annum.
The Greens cite the ever declining cost of batteries, solar and wind, and last week’s damning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report, as reason to invest massively and rapidly now in renewable energy generation and storage.
They’re not wrong, but their plan ignores any mention of the state’s success to date in doing just that.
Under Jay Weatherill’s more than six years of Labor rule to 2018, and the subsequent and ongoing stewardship of Steven Marshall’s Liberal Party, the Government of South Australia has managed and continues to evolve South Australia’s energy transition ahead of other Australian states and an international pack. 
It is widely regarded as a trailblazer in its policies which have incentivised rooftop solar and battery uptake, including for homes unsuited to solar installation, supported development of virtual power plants, pioneered the use of a massive battery to stabilise the grid, and continue to innovate in the integration of variable renewable energies to the grid.
The Greens, however, say that “Essential services like electricity should not be in private hands and run for profit,” and highlight the creation of jobs — 9,600 in renewable energy installation and maintenance, and 10,000 in building 40,000 new public-housing homes — as one of the key social outcomes of their policies.
Another pillar of their policy will be to fund a free public transport system at a cost of $433.4 over four years, and invest $1 billion in improving the transport network.
Premier Stephen Marshall responded saying his Liberal Government is focused on jobs creation, administering a $7.4 billion health budget, and delivering essential infrastructure that will free South Australians from the tyranny of traffic jams.
The Greens hope to win the balance of power in South Australia’s upper house, perhaps by garnering votes from disaffected followers of all parties in the state, including SA Best since the retirement from politics of its founder Nick Xenophon.
.@greensSA is proposing huge mining, bank and developer taxes for cheap power and free public transport. What do you think of the idea? Details: https://t.co/TY7C2uvFEs #saparli #TheAdvertiser pic.twitter.com/T9g0Sm8Y3U

SA Best’s current elected members, Connie Bonaros and Frank Pangallo, recently criticised the state government’s budget for overspending on “big-ticket” items such as a $700 million entertainment centre, which they say the state cannot afford.
They added that such expenditure shows that Marshall’s Liberal Party is out of touch with a community struggling with “the worst unemployment rate in Australia, a mental health system at breaking point, the Women’s and Children’s Hospital in crisis, public hospital EDs overflowing and ambulance ramping at record levels”.
The Greens come at government deficit, the growing inequalities exposed by the Covid-16 pandemic, inadequate social services and resulting community hardship, from a different perspective, saying the big end of town — the miners, banks and property developers — should pay their “fair share of tax” to help fund a more equitable society; and tackle global warming and boost employment through still greater investment in renewable energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/16/blue-is-not-the-new-green/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 16, 2021",Blue is not the new green,"From pv magazine Global
Proponents of blue hydrogen produced with fossil fuels and carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS) technologies often present it as a cleaner alternative to hydrogen produced with the steam methane reforming (SMR) process, or so-called “grey hydrogen,” which is now the prevailing generation source globally. Blue hydrogen advocates also view it as a potential partner for green hydrogen produced with renewables in facilitating an emissions-free energy transition.
The blue fuel, however, is not as green as described, according to a new study from Stanford University and Cornell University. The research concludes that the CO2 footprint of hydrogen produced with fossil fuels is more than 20% greater than heat generated by natural gas or coal and around 60% greater than burning diesel oil for heat.
“We emphasise that our analysis in this paper is a best-case scenario for blue hydrogen,” the scientists said. “It assumes that the carbon dioxide that is captured can indeed be stored indefinitely for decades and centuries into the future.”
They said that blue hydrogen emissions include carbon dioxide and unburned fugitive methane and said that their modelling considered the lifecycle emissions linked to the mining, transport, storage, and use of methane. They considered several CCUS techniques for blue hydrogen, including the carbon dioxide released by the SMR process, and the removal of additional carbon dioxide from the gases created by burning methane to provide the heat and high pressure needed to drive the SMR process. They also looked at the carbon dioxide and methane from the energy used to produce electricity for the carbon-capture equipment.
According to their modelling, the carbon dioxide emissions of blue hydrogen were only between 9% and 12% lower than those of grey hydrogen.
“While carbon dioxide emissions are lower, fugitive methane emissions for blue hydrogen are higher than for grey hydrogen because of an increased use of natural gas to power the carbon capture,” the research group explained.
Fugitive methane emissions are estimated at 43 g CO2 equivalent per megajoule of hydrogen produced, the researchers said. They defined the recent bet on blue hydrogen by many fossil fuel companies as a “distraction,” and they argued that it might only delay the much-needed decarbonisation of the global economy.
“We further note that much of the push for using hydrogen for energy since 2017 has come from the Hydrogen Council, a group established by the oil and gas industry specifically to promote hydrogen, with a major emphasis on blue hydrogen,” they said.
They described their findings in “How green is blue hydrogen?,” which was recently published in Energy Science & Engineering.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/16/arc-future-fellowships-rocket-boost-the-cheap-light-solar-for-space-race/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"AUGUST 16, 2021","ARC Future Fellowships rocket boost the cheap, light, solar-for-space race","Sydney University’s Professor Anita Ho-Baillie has won Australian Research Council (ARC) Future Fellowships funding of more than a million dollars, to extend her frequently cited research into perovskite solar cells and develop space-ready photovoltaics that “could result in billions of dollars in savings for the satellite market”, as well as boost the viability of future deep space probes, Mars rovers and moon mining, said USyd in an announcement last week.
Although space hardware is already largely powered by photovoltaic generation, existing technologies are heavy and expensive to manufacture compared to the promise of perovskites which use lower cost component materials and deliver a higher power-to-weight ratio — critical in equipment that must be launched against the earth’s gravity and travel long distances to reach its destination, or to efficiently orbit the earth.
The ARC Future Fellowships program is designed to support “excellent mid-career researchers to undertake high-quality research in areas of national and international benefit”.
Last year, Ho-Baillie, the inaugural John Hooke Chair of Nanoscience at the University of Sydney was one of a group of scientists from the University of New South Wales and USyd to claim a world first in global efforts to develop durable metal-halide perovskite solar cells, when their perovskites passed strict International Electrotechnical Commission testing standards for heat and humidity.
Unlike silicon solar cells, perovskites, which are frequently hailed as the “next generation” of low-cost solar technology, have not yet been produced in a way that equals silicon’s endurance under long-term environmental stresses.
Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify the decomposition pathways of hybrid perovskites, the scientists last year found that encapsulating the cells in glass combined with low-cost synthetic rubber- or a polyolefin-based polymer, conferred excellent durability that exceeded the requirements of the IEC61215:2016 Dam Heat and Humidity Freeze tests.
At the time, Ho-Baillie said, “Perovskite cells will need to stack up against the current commercial standards. That’s what is so exciting about our research. We have shown that we can drastically improve their thermal stability.”
Deployment in space will expose the metal-halide perovskites under development by Ho-Baillie to other and sometimes far more severe conditions than are experienced on Earth.
Her aim is “to develop and demonstrate perovskite solar cells to achieve high areal power conversion efficiencies and long operating lifetimes withstanding the space environment”, says the ARC.
Ho-Baillie’s is one of 100 ARC Future Fellowships projects awarded more than $93 million across a wide field of scientific endeavour. The successful projects represent only 15% of applications received.
The announcement of ARC funding for this project comes just days after Australia’s science agency, the CSIRO announced it would partner with Adelaide-based in-space transportation provider Space Machines Company (SMC), to test the CSIRO’s perovskite-based cell technology — in the form of solar inks printed on flexible plastic films — on SMC’s spacecraft Optimus-1 which will be launched next year.
Other researchers who are working in photovoltaics and were successful in this year’s Future Fellowships round include Swinburne University of Technology’s Associate Professor Tianyi Ma, who will develop perovskite-based ferroelectrics for solar fuel production.
And the University of Queensland’s Dr Jingwei Hou, whose project will investigate a stable and efficient semiconductive composite material consisting of metal halide perovskite embedded in metal-organic framework glass. The composite is expected to contribute to “a new generation of environmentally safe perovskite devices for energy, environmental and health application”, says the ARC announcement.

India has reached 100 GW of installed renewable energy (RE) capacity, excluding large hydro. Globally, the nation ranks fourth in terms of installed RE capacity, fifth in solar, and fourth in wind, according to a release by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.
The installed RE capacity mix includes solar, wind, small hydro projects (≤ 25 MW), biomass, and urban and industrial waste power. If large hydro is also included, the installed RE capacity increases to 146 GW.
Besides the installed 100 GW, 50 GW of RE capacity is said to be under construction and 27 GW in the tendering stages, according to the government release.
As per the data available from the Central Electricity Authority, solar, at around 44 GW (as of July 31, 2021), accounts for 44% of India’s installed RE capacity, and wind close to 40 GW.
India has set ambitious RE targets of 175 GW by 2022 and 450 GW by 2030.
The achievement of an installed RE capacity of 100 GW is an important milestone in India’s journey towards its target of 450 GW by 2030.
