Last week at the All-Energy virtual conference, Trina Solar spruiked a new 670 Watt Vertex-series panel (expected to be listed by the Clean Energy Council  as compliant with Australian standards this month — November) to the Australian market, and announced a Sydney-based training centre for installers of TrinaTrackers.
pv magazine Australia caught up with Gilhooly to see how the new Trina offerings can help ease the pain points of developers here on the ground.
pv magazine: How are Australian sites for utility scale solar becoming more challenging? 
Andy Gilhooly: In the past five years working in the utility segment, I’ve seen a pronounced increase in more challenging sites, firstly in terms of available area. Sites are becoming more constrained, especially with the propensity for pretty much every utility farm to bolt on a battery either now or at some stage in the future. So as we try to achieve effective cycling and utilisation of that battery — packing in every possible megawatt DC that you can — what might previously have been an unconstrained site very quickly becomes constrained. 
We’re also seeing sites with irregular boundaries where previously you used to have nice expansive four-corner patches of land completely flat and with soils that facilitated effective piling of the tracker foundations. Now it’s as though the low-hanging fruit in terms of good sites has been depleted and what’s left is an increasingly challenging array of sites with highly variable terrain, sites that are rocky, or even sites that are prone to flood inundation.
Also with optimal sites in terms of connection and proximity to demand having been snapped up, we’re seeing sites situated further and further away from large population centres, which brings with it a commensurate increase in mobilisation-of-labour cost. In remote regions, where our customers are often competing with existing industries like coal mining, and there’s not a lot of available labour close by, they’re having to bus people in and out and in a high labor cost market like Australia, that’s pretty significant. Plus with the mining industry also coming on board with renewable energy aspirations, there’s an overall increase in challenging very remote sites.
So how does the new, larger module help with challenging sites?
Trina was the first mover last year to these large-format modules and that’s reached a crescendo with the launch of our 670 Watt module that utilises an M12 210-millimetre wafer. The cells used in the modules are larger than competitor modules, which means fewer cells are needed and therefore the operating voltage is lower. So for the same amount of megawatts there are fewer electrical strings for installers to crimp and connect, there’s less DC trenching, and there are fewer combiner boxes on a balance of system level.
Trina Solar
Tracker design must be crucial to addressing site challenges…
Firstly, Trina has always been at the forefront of bifacial technology on the modules. As I say we were the first mover to these large-format high wattage modules last year, and we’re the only module manufacturer to offer a truly integrative solution of bifacial module and intelligent single-axis tracker. We find that the customers who build, own and operate the asset, and therefore have a long-term view, respond favourably to the one-stop shop and single point of accountability and service as an inherently more bankable and lower technology risk.
And we are one of the few technologies to have been deployed at scale in cyclonic regions. Combined with being a first mover in that large module space, we understand the challenges and the engineering complexities of successfully accommodating these pretty large modules into our single axis trackers in a fashion that’s absolutely, structurally fit for purpose.
How many projects are actually utilising bifacial panels these days?
Within the utility segment, we’ve seen a shift where pretty much every project that we’re quoting with our trackers is utilising bifacial, because the price premium on the product has narrowed as bifacial technology has scaled. Then you get a synergy or a value stacking effect by using a bifacial module on a tracker; the increase in energy exceeds what you would get from a bifacial on a fixed structure because they’re they’re higher off the ground, they’re more widely spaced so they let more more sunlight in and around and on the underside of the modules which is how bifacial modules function and unlock more energy. So for a relatively modest increase in capex, you’re unlocking potentially more than 5% extra energy. Most developers now are seeing bifacial combined with trackers as the way to go.
We also see an additional boost in energy because trackers, being a bit higher off the ground, enable a slightly more convective cooling effect of the wind on the panels.
And an unexpected bonus is that the potential to unlock colocation of solar and agriculture is made easier by using trackers. In fact, Trina Solar, has deployed its tracking technology on a 30 megawatt poverty-alleviation project in China which ran a scheme to encourage the uptake of solar in agriculture. On that project, the tracker structure was elevated almost three metres to enable large vehicles to traverse the site underneath and facilitate cropping. 
Why did Trina feel the need to open an Australian training and certification centre installers of its trackers?
Shortly after we acquired the Spanish tracker business, we launched our two types of trackers — the Vanguard 2P single-row tracker and Agile 1P dual-row tracker — into the market, but unfortunately, with the restrictions around travel and large events and not being able to exhibit at the usual industry shows we had to find a way to increase the familiarity of our products to the wider market and probably even more importantly to those installers who are tasked by our customers to build their solar farms. People were extremely interested and curious about the trackers, so we decided to set up this training facility in Sydney where customers and installers can trial the assembly process, get the components in their own hands and see the inherent benefits that they unlock. 
What volume of utility solar does Trina have in its Australian pipeline at the moment?
Despite the challenges last year, we’ve been really encouraged by the traction we’ve gained. With our one-portrait Agile tracker we expect to close multiple projects totalling over 120 MW to be built in Australia next year. And our two-portrait Vanguard tracker is already specified as the technology of choice on over 300 MW of projects to be built in Australia and New Zealand next year.
What would make purchasers of other brand solar panels come to Trina for trackers?
Aside from being one of the few trackers to have been successfully deployed in cyclonic wind regions, I’d say low-foundation count is a big drawcard. When our 2P Vanguard tracker is used in conjunction with our 670 Watt bifacial modules, it requires a very, very low foundation count — as low as 100 foundations per megawatt. Other trackers that have one in portrait might require 200 to 300 foundations per megawatt. So that’s a considerable saving itself, but it also opens up the possibility of deploying trackers on sites that were previously considered unviable because they might be really rocky and you have to do a lot of pre drilling, or on sites with uncohesive soil, where you’ve got to bury the piles three or four metres deep to achieve stability. By so significantly reducing the number of foundations, we really mitigate the cost penalty of building on those challenging sites. 
Also, the patented spherical bearings on our tracker mechanism can articulate in three dimensions, which gives our trackers a really, really good slope tolerance of up to 30% in any direction. Again, on sites that were previously considered unviable because you would need to do so much civil work and cutting and filling to prepare them, we can deploy without disturbing the land, which is also more sustainable.

This joint Rio Tinto-BlueScope announcement, comes hot on the heels of Rio’s ramping of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction target to 50% by 2030, and declares both companies’ intention to “focus on utilising green hydrogen for direct reduction of Rio Tinto’s Pilbara iron ores”, said BlueScope Chief Executive Mark Vassella in an announcement on Friday.
Their statement went on to declare that, “The first phase of the collaboration will be to determine the scale of a pilot plant,” at BlueScope’s Port Kembla steelworks, which will consist of a hydrogen electrolyser, direct reduction process and melter.
In June, Jessica Allen (an expert in low-emissions energy technologies and thermal transformations) and Tom Honeyhands, Director at the Centre of Ironmaking Materials Research, both the University of Newcastle, wrote an article in The Conversation explaining that direct reduced iron (DRI) technology offers the greatest opportunity for the use of green hydrogen.
The process currently accounts for less than 5% of steel production and often uses methane gas to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide which are then used to transform iron ore into iron.
Allen and Honeyhands wrote that, “Up to 70% of the hydrogen derived from methane could be replaced with green hydrogen without having to modify the production process too much”, and added that development of a process using 100% green hydrogen as feedstock is under way.
Honeyhands and Allen point out that the green-hydrogen reduction method still produces CO2 emissions, and requires more electricity than the currently dominant blast-furnace method based on coking coal, but that its “overall emission intensity can be substantially lower”.
BlueScope and Rio Tinto intend further processing the iron ore reduced using green hydrogen “in an electric melter to produce metallic iron suitable to be finished into steel” — they say that, like the electricity used to power the hydrogen electrolysers, the electricity running the melter would also be sourced from renewables.
According to recent studies two tonnes (averaged over different feedstocks and processes used worldwide) of CO2 are produced per tonne of steel manufactured; the steel sector accounts for around 7% of all anthropomorphic CO2 emissions; and steel production is expected to grow by 25-30% by 2050.
For DRI to be an effective antidote to current and future emissions, it would have to become the dominant technology in steel manufacturing the world over, and Australia has an opportunity to become a world leader in using this method and meeting future demand for green steel.
The BlueScope-Rio Tinto MOU also encompasses the enhancement of existing processes to reduce emissions, and allows “more projects to be added” as promising technologies mature, the statement said.
Rio Tinto already uses gas-fed DRI in the northern hemisphere, and BlueScope deploys electric melters at its Glenbrook Steelworks in New Zealand; experience that the two companies say will benefit their green-steel ambitions.
BlueScope and Rio Tinto are also among the indirect recipients of government funding to lower their emissions: that is, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency in July announced a $2 million boost to its existing $300,000 support of Monash University’s Australian Industry Energy Transitions Initiative.
This initiative works to develop pathways for Australian industry that accelerate action towards net-zero emissions across supply chains — such as iron and steel, alumina and aluminium and liquefied natural gas — considered critical to the Australian economy.
In its Climate Action report released in September, BlueScope itself announced a climate action fund of up to $150 million; while a Rio Tinto investment seminar held in October said its accelerated 2030 emissions target is “supported by around $7.5 billion of direct investments to lower emissions between 2022 and 2030”.
That’s a worldwide decarbonising fund bucket spread across the miner’s commodity portfolio. In Australia, it said it was focused on developing renewable power sources for iron ore in the Pilbara and for its aluminium smelters, including commitments of “$0.5 billion per year from 2022 to 2024”.
These figures give some an indication of Rio’s understanding of the risks of not acting, and the opportunities for carbon-reduced product in a near-future global economy.
In May last year analysis in the Grattan Institute report Start with steel: A practical plan to support carbon workers and cut emissions showed that if Australia could capture 6.5% of the global steel market, it “would generate about $65 billion in annual export revenue and could create 25,000 manufacturing jobs in Queensland and NSW”.
The report emphasised however that green steel would rapidly become a competitive field, and that while the investment needed to deliver on such a global-scale opportunity “can only come from the private sector”, governments should plan for this future now, and help facilitate it.
In the statement issued by Rio and BlueScope on Friday, Rio Tinto Iron OreChief Executive Simon Trott said of the intentions outlined in the MOU, “It’s early days, but given both BlueScope and a Rio Tinto are committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we realise we need to investigate multiple pathways and strike partnerships across the steel value chain.”
Vassella laid the groundwork for wider collaboration saying the DRI focus, “is an important program — one which will need broad support from governments, regulators, customers and suppliers”.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/01/sunman-unveils-430-w-glass-free-solar-module/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 1, 2021",Sunman unveils 430 W glass free solar module,"From pv magazine Global
Chinese solar module manufacturer Sunman has launched a new panel series with a power output of up to 430 W.
“An innovation combining proven crystalline silicon solar cells with Sunman’s patented composite material, eArc has the same durability and robustness of conventional glass modules,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “However, unlike glass, eArc is akin to a flexible ‘solar skin’ that is 70% lighter and up to 95% thinner.”
The eArc SMF430F module is available in two versions with nominal power of 425 and 430 W and a power conversion efficiency of 19.0 and 19.3%, respectively. Its open circuit voltage is 49.6-49.8 V and the short-circuit current is 10.67-10.64 A.
The new product has a size of 2,125×1,051x35mm and weighs in at 11.2kg. It relies on 144 half-cut monocrystalline cells, a white backsheet, a frame made of anodised aluminium alloy, and a junction box with an IP 68 rating.
The glass free panel can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,000 V and an operating temperature between -40 degrees Celsius and 85 degrees Celsius. The power temperature coefficient is -0.38% per degree Celsius.
The new module, which comes with a 25-year linear power output warranty and a 12-year product guarantee, is manufactured through a process based on the use of glass fibre reinforced plastic (GRP), which the manufacturer says reduces light reflection and opens up new assembly options. As with other products from the company, the new panel can be bonded directly to curved roofs. 
“The eArc modules can be the way to make solar energy usable in the long term and economically, particularly in the case of existing buildings or areas that make conventional assembly uneconomical or, for example, impossible due to a load limit,” the manufacturer said in a statement released.

Gigawatts are needed, tens of gigawatts are expected, after the Central West Orana REZ drew 27 GW of interest when it had planned to coordinate 3 GW; and the New England REZ attracted 34 GW for a proposed 8 GW of integrated assets — no hard sell required.
The three REZ’s for which ROIs have so far been requested are the vanguard of five zones identified to date; those yet to begin formalisation are the Illawarra and Hunter-Central Coast REZs.
In November last year, New South Wales legislated to install 12 GW of renewable generation and 2 GW of energy storage over 10 years, to replace retiring coal-plant generation. At the time, commentators put the commitment in perspective by calculating it was equal to the combined electricity consumption of Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania.
But green hydrogen export ambitions, and the transition of hard-to-abate industries to renewables may well increase demand for clean generation, and investors and developers have so far been eager to participate in REZ ROIs partly because being included in the count helps the government plan appropriate transmission and distribution infrastructure and put in place incentives to drive high-energy-using manufacturers into REZ areas.
The South-West REZ was identified in the Australian Energy Market Operator’s Integrated System Plan as an area rich in solar resources. 
Its indicative location was first published as part of the NSW Transmission Infrastructure Strategy in 2018, and its boundaries have since been adjusted to take advantage of developments such as the green-lighting of Project EnergyConnect — the 900-kilometre, 330 kV transmission project dubbed an energy superhighway linking South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria (via an offshoot from Buronga in NSW to Red Cliff across the the Victorian border).
NSW EnergyCo/AEMO
The area around Buronga was also included because of its strong wind resource. At the same time, the eastern and northern boundaries of the South-West REZ have been retracted, “to balance interactions with existing agricultural land uses, including irrigated cropping, and ensure reasonable connection distances to planned transmission infrastructure”, says the NSW Government website dedicated to registrations of interest in this latest REZ.
The boundaries may be further refined, says EnergyCo, the statutory authority established by the state government to lead the delivery of New South Wales REZs, as it responds to registrations of interest which will inform the “timing, capacity, design and location of the South-West REZ”, explains the site.
There is already a significant pipeline of projects planned for the region as defined to date; they include the proposed 2.5 GW Dinawan Energy Hub — a hybrid of solar PV, wind and battery storage technologies — recently announced by network infrastructure owner Spark Investment.
To be situated on the edge of the South-West REZ, near Jerilderie, Dinawan is in the path of Project EnergyConnect (scheduled for completion in 2024) and will also take advantage of the VNI West Interconnector between North Ballarat in Victoria, and Darlington Point and Wagga Wagga in New South Wales (scheduled for completion in 2027).
NSW EnergyCo emphasises that a registration of interest (ROI) for NSW’s third REZ does not constitute a formal proposal and “will not impact project outcomes in future NSW Government contracting processes”.
Registrations may be submitted here until 24 November.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/01/tesla-orders-45-gwh-of-ev-batteries-from-catl/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",DAVID WAGMAN,"NOVEMBER 1, 2021",Tesla orders 45 GWh of EV batteries from CATL,"From pv magazine USA
Chinese media reported that Tesla ordered 45 GWh of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries from Chinese battery producer CATL. The batteries reportedly will be used for the automaker’s Model 3 and the Model Y.
The reports calculated that the 45 GWh would be enough to support production of 800,000 vehicles, which is more than Tesla’s sales through the first three quarters of 2021 (625,000 units). The news outlet pegged the battery capacity of the two models at 55 kWh and 60 kWh.
On October 28, CATL broke ground on a new lithium-ion battery production base in Yichun, east China’s Jiangxi Province. The first phase of the project involves an investment of around $2.1 billion to build a 50 GWh lithium-ion battery production base.
News outlets said that Tesla’s Nevada battery plant is expected to expand production to more than 40 GWh. Additional supplies from Panasonic and LG Chem led the outlet to speculate that global sales for Tesla in 2022 could be around 1.5 million vehicles.
The first LFP-powered Tesla model was the standard-range Model 3 made in its Shanghai factory. Earlier this year, the Shanghai-made standard range Model Y also switched to an LFP battery.
At the end of August, Tesla said that its U.S. customers would have the option of buying an LFP-powered Model 3. And, in reporting its third-quarter financial results in October, Tesla said that it would shift to LFP battery chemistry globally for its standard-range vehicles.
