BYD presented new additions to its Battery-Box product series in Munich, Germany, last month at The Smarter E Europe. Primarily, this means a new offering for the commercial & industrial solar market, which it is calling the Battery-Max Lite.
The new C&I battery system comes in capacities from 30 kWh to 90 kWh, and up to 64 units can be connected in parallel for a total capacity of 5.76 MWh. According to BYD, the new C&I battery is compatible with PV inverters from different manufacturers, allowing end users to mix and match to build the most efficient system. It also features open communication and control interfaces, so that the battery management system can be integrated into different energy management systems.
“We have designed the Battery-Box series with the goal to provide customers and installers with a maximum of versatility to fulfil a wide variety of application requirements with a flexible, modular system,” said Julia Chen, Global Director, BYD Battery-Box. “For this reason, we also decided to follow an open system approach making it possible to combine our Battery-Box systems with the most suitable components from trusted partners to achieve the best possible performance for each individual application scenario”.
On the residential side, a recent study from the University of Applied Sciences in Berlin, Germany, found that BYD’s products in combination with PV inverter suppliers amounted to the four most efficient systems on the market in Germany.
At The Smarter E Europe, BYD also previewed a new high-voltage storage product that it plans to launch later this year. Both products are based on lithium-iron phosphate battery chemistry, manufactured using BYD’s “blade” battery technology. Visitors to the company’s booth will be able to take a closer at these individual components.
“An energy storage battery system consists of battery cells, mechanical finishing and intelligent control systems. Considering this, the system performance is influenced by the entire value chain,” said Chen. “To create the storage chemistry formula, to design the right cell format, to initiate the most accurate algorithm logic, to predict the life-cycle data, to realise the seamless communication with the inverters – these are important areas into which BYD is continually investing to keep driving the evolution of innovative energy storage solutions.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/31/graziers-in-nsw-agrisolar-trial-report-improved-wool-quality/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 31, 2022",Graziers in NSW agrisolar trial report improved wool quality,"Famous for its involvement in the Apollo 11 Moon landing, Parkes, a town in New South Wales’ central west, has again found itself at a technology zenith. Well, if you can consider grazing sheep below solar farms cutting edge and not simply sensible. 
Wool broker Graeme Ostini, who is involved in the Parkes Solar Farm agrisolar (also known as agrivoltaics) trial, told the ABC he has seen benefits, including improved wool quality and quantity. “The wool cuts are in the top 5% in the district,” he told the outlet.
In the four years since the project began, the solar panels have provided shade to the sheep and the water which condensed on the panels, even during the drought, has been dripping onto the paddock and keeping the pasture green. 
In turn, the sheep manage the grass and weeds below the panels, doing maintenance that projects would typically need to hire someone for.
Ostini said all in all, his income has increased through the colocation of sheep and solar. 
Dubbo farmer and grazier Tom Warren has seen similar results, telling the ABC his 250-strong merino herd has had better wool. He believes the results occurred because of their improved conditions.
“It’s relatively clean, without burrs, without dust. There’s very, very little contamination of the wool and they’re protected from the sun as well,” Warren said.
Councillor Ken Keith, Mayor of Parkes and Show Society member, told the Clean Energy Council, which compiled a guide to agrisolar last year, that such projects are proving a win-win.
“It’s a win-win for the community and the solar farm. It helps the Show Society stay afloat while reducing the maintenance costs for the solar farm,” Keith said.
Agrisolar in the form of solar with sheep grazing is already popular in Australia, but other forms of agrisolar are emerging internationally. There are projects looking to support horticulture, viticulture, aquaculture and even cropping activities happening now.
“Recent international studies have shown that some crops can be grown at the same or even an improved rate under solar PV,” the Clean Energy Council said. “The studies suggest this is due to the panels protecting the crops from sun damage and extreme weather events, increasing soil moisture and reducing soil temperature on hot days.”
Despite the promising results, regional NSW has experienced a backlash against solar projects on agricultural land. In March, Independent Wagga Wagga MP Joe McGirr backed the formation of the Riverina Sustainable Food Alliance which is seeking to “safeguard valuable farmland and food security against the expansion of solar factories in the region.”
Likewise, last year the NSW branch of the Country Women’s Association voted to prevent solar farms from being developed in prime agricultural areas.

Open from today, the tender will seek input from local, national and international organisations to deliver technical, design and delivery concepts for the project. This process is part of the new Labor state government’s Hydrogen Jobs Plan, which it plans to deliver no later than December 2025.
The market sounding process will be open for six weeks, closing on July 15. An information session on the process will be held on June 15, though a precise time is yet to be determined.

The Whyalla hydrogen plant was one of government’s major election promises and will involve a 250 MWe hydrogen electrolyser facility, a 200MW hydrogen-fuelled power station and storage capacity capable of holding 3,600 tonnes of hydrogen. While the precise location of the facility has not yet been determined, it will be near Whyalla on the east coast of the Eyre Peninsula.
Malinauskas said the electrolysers would use excess renewable energy to produce green hydrogen, reducing the need to remotely switch off rooftop solar for households and businesses, and would help unlock a $20 billion pipeline of renewable energy projects in the state.
Malinauskas also announced that his government will develop new legislation to regulate hydrogen production, storage and transportation. The legislation will also cover licensing, and will presumably follow templates used for oil and gas industries.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/31/green-hydrogen-megaproject-in-sa-discontinued/,"HYDROGEN,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 31, 2022",Green hydrogen megaproject in SA discontinued,"Terry Kallis, founder of Kallis Energy Investments, confirmed over the weekend that his company’s 6 GW Moolawatana Green Hydrogen Project will not progress following an assessment of its water supply. 
“That assessment, which was foreshadowed in the original project announcement, has determined that the environmental and permitting risks associated with water supply and desalination were unacceptable. Hence, the project has been stopped,” Kallis posted on LinkedIn. 
The Moolawatana Green Hydrogen Project had proposed to construct a combined solar and wind farm, each with up to 3 GW of capacity, which would solely power electrolysers on 100,000 hectares just east of the northern Flinders Ranges. Kallis Energy had also planned to include a desalination plant at the site and, as Kallis noted, had already flagged water as a potential hurdle, which was later found to be insurmountable in the prefeasibility stage.
“Not all projects work and it is important that developers determine fatal flaws as early as possible in the project timeline and communicate this to stakeholders,” Kallis said. 
Kallis said he had considered alternative locations with better water prospects, but was unable to find anything suitable for the massive multi-gigawatt the scale sought. 
The discontinuance of the Moolawatana project will not impact the Murchison Renewable Hydrogen project in Western Australia, Kallis added, for which he is a co-founder.
The Murchison proposal involves up to 5.2 GW of combined onshore wind and solar energy and is targeting the production of two million tonnes per annum of green ammonia for export. The proposed site for the for that project is in the Northampton shire, at a site approximately 20 kilometres north of Kalbarri on the mid coast of WA.
Kallis said Murchison Renewable Hydrogen project is “full steam ahead.”
The company founder did not comment on another two major projects Kallis Energy is involved in, the offshore 2 GW Star of the South wind farm and the Starfish Hill Wind Farm in SA, but presumably these projects too are unaffected by the Moolawatana news.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/31/melbourne-based-8-star-energy-set-to-shine-in-europe/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,EUROPE",PV MAGAZINE,"MAY 31, 2022",Melbourne-based 8 Star Energy set to shine in Europe ,"Melbourne-based 8 Star Energy, Australia’s licensed partner for Energizer and Eveready, has entered a further exclusive distribution partnership with Energizer Solar and Germany-based Memodo to distribute solar modules, power storage, inverters and charging stations throughout Germany, Austria, Switzerland (DACH region) and 28 other European countries. 
Memodo founder and CEO Daniel Schmitt said that “With 8 Star Energy, we are cooperating with a strong company that is ideally prepared to become one of the key players in renewable energy. We are very proud to accompany this path and provide the platform to bring the brand and components to the masses.” 
Schmitt added that he saw this as a “long-lasting and successful partnership.” And considering the still unchanging situation of product shortages mixed with high demand and supply constraints, the partnership couldn’t come at a better time for European off-takers. 
Last month, at The Smarter E Europe event in Munich, Germany, Schmitt told pv magazine that he currently sees that 80% of the photovoltaic systems that are currently being installed in Germany are coming with a storage device. 
That figure may sound extraordinarily high to Australian ears, but in the future Schmitt assumes every system will be built with an integrated battery storage system. 
Australia’s uptake of home battery systems and electric vehicles (EVs) is slow by comparison to Europe, but judging by how the high-EV penetration in Europe has buoyed residential storage uptake, Australia’s home battery boom can’t be far behind. 
No wonder Energizer Solar has launched its complete PV portfolio of modules, storage, inverters and charging solutions in Europe. Including its Beam monocrystalline PERC modules (365-500 Wp), the all-in-one 6.1 kWh to 24.4 kWh Energizer Homepower system with backup power function, the stackable Energizer Home Hybrid battery (3.97-27.8 kWh), the Energizer Force, Force S and Force T inverter series, and the Energizer wall boxes and charging stations (AC wall boxes from 7 kW, DC 480 kW charging stations). 
Nevertheless, it seems the trend for companies to test out new solutions in Australia is proving profitable not just for international players, but homegrown companies too. Energizer Solar’s successful launch in the hands of 8 Star Energy has demonstrated that one of the world’s most trusted battery brands trusts 8 Star Energy to get the job done on the renewable energy hungry European stage.
8 Star Energy’s general manager for Europe, Marcus Brunner, said the entrance of Energizer Solar to the European market is the arrival of a world leader in battery cells. “With Memodo, we have found a partner operating across Europe that is not only a classic wholesaler, but also provides knowledge and drives the energy transition,” says Brunner. “Our DNA are related and an exclusive partnership is thus the logical consequence.” 
Energizer’s senior manager of licensing, Scott Meczkowski, described the European launch as a significant step forward for 8 Star Energy. “There is a growing appetite for renewable energy solutions,” says Meczkowski, “and we’re confident their new line of solar products will be well received by consumers and renewable energy distributors alike.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/31/trina-solars-pathway-to-topcon/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 31, 2022",Trina Solar’s pathway to TOPCon,"From pv magazine Global
Chinese module manufacturer Trina Solar plans to release new solar modules based on tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon).
“TOPCon is not new to Trina, we built our first pilot project four years ago – a 400 MW solar plant under China’s Top Runner program,” Helena Li, president of the company’s global cell and module business, told pv magazine in a short interview at the recent Smarter E event in Munich, Germany. “We utilised our own n-type TOPCon technology in that project, but when we built that customers were not ready to buy these products, as prices were too high, although we had a production line of a certain size. However, we built on this experience for our current approach.”
The company is still uncertain about when it will launch its new n-type TOPCon products.
“This time it depends on the shortage of components and materials,” Li said. “We don’t want a new product which may eventually not be able to supply.”
She said the whole n-type transition is now being postponed. The company plans to raise its capacity for new n-type products from 500 MW to 20 GW by the end of 2023.
“We are also looking at interdigitated back-contact (IBC) and heterojunction, but first we want to expand our TOPCon business,” said Li.
In March, Trina Solar said that its 210 mm × 210 mm TOPCon cell had achieved an efficiency of 25.5%.
“Our 210 plus n-type technology is undergoing rapid advance, expected to increase power by another 3% to 5%, further driving down [the levelised cost of electricity]. Surely in the offing, but constrained by supply chain pressure,” Li said. “Our shipments have already grown 40% year on year, maintaining a high market share, despite all difficulties. Trina Solar will keep developing TOPCon tech rapidly and is planning to raise its capacity for new n-type products from 500 MW currently to 20 GW by the end of 2023.”
Supply chain issues have been going on longer than the company initially expected, she noted.
“First the covid and then all these logistics issues. Then there was the problem with the Suez canal, and now there are the war in Ukraine and the inflation. Furthermore, there is a new covid crisis in China. You can see what we had to go through,” Li said.
The current situation is teaching the company about its own clients, however.
“It is teaching our industry how to adapt to new and unknown circumstances. For example, previously we could never suspect that shipping costs for solar modules may be between US$0.04 and US$0.05 per watt. This is 15% or 20% of the total module costs, and we never expected this to materialise,” she said.
“In spite of current constraints, we are very optimistic about the European markets. Trina Solar has been playing a leading role in Europe and globally, with more than 22 GW shipped to European markets to date, ranking first in the region.”
The company has launched a number of joint ventures or partnerships to diversify its polysilicon, ingot and wafer sources over the past year, especially in Southeast Asia.
“We realised supply chain can not be centralised in one place and customers also want independence. Our mid-term strategy is to have a clear fragmentation of products and markets, as well as geographically diversify our supply chain. Different markets require different supply chains,” said Li.
Trina Solar is now considering more solar factories through new partnerships.
“We are looking at US as everyone else and we already conducted some feasibility studies. And Europe is also an option,” Li said, without providing further details.
