A collaborative work of the ESB, the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC), the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), the reforms are aimed at “systematically modernising the market design and regulatory frameworks to meet the needs of the energy transition”.
ESB independent chair Kerry Schott said the proposals, developed in response to a request from energy ministers in 2019, are designed to support an orderly transition to a modern, new Australian energy system with a rapidly increasing growth in large- and small-scale renewable generation.
“This isn’t just a tweak around the edges, it’s about a whole redesign of the National Electricity Market (NEM),” she said.
“We all know reform isn’t optional. It is not something we can choose to do, it’s something we have to do to confidently embrace Australia’s energy future while reducing the risk of price shocks and blackouts.
“The clearer and more coordinated the path, and the smoother the transition, the more confidence consumers, industry, investors and governments will have.”
Schott said the final advice is a package of timely and interrelated reforms and actions to successfully integrate the transition to renewable generation already underway.
Included in the ESB’s draft report is a recommendation to impose a centralised strategic reserve across the NEM and that a decentralised capacity market be built around an “enhanced” retailer reliability obligation (RRO).
The ESB acknowledged in its summary of industry responses to the draft report that the bulk of the feedback received was not supportive of the capacity mechanism but have still included it in its recommendations.
Smart Energy Council (SEC) chief executive John Grimes told pv magazine the proposed mechanism could provide an incentive to keep coal generators operating for longer and needs to be shut down.
“The Energy Security Board is recommending a capacity mechanism against the advice of national and international experts,” he said.
“A capacity mechanism is a costly, unnecessary means to keep coal-fired generators open longer just when big batteries, the storage potential of electric vehicles and renewable hydrogen are taking off.
“The ESB’s advice goes against the best interests of Australians and against Australia meeting its Paris climate commitments.”

Federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor is among those who support the capacity mechanism, saying it “will be crucial to ensuring that we can absorb renewables into the grid without threatening reliability and affordability”.
“The pace and scale of changes underway in our electricity system is unprecedented, and it is essential that the NEM remains fit-for-purpose into the future in order to protect consumers from high prices and reliability risks as technologies in the energy sector change,” he said.
Grimes however disputed the need, saying establishing a strategic operating reserve would be sufficient.
“The National Energy Market does not need both a capacity market and a strategic reserve,” he said.
“A strategic operating reserve as the ESB has proposed is sufficient, together with the existing state government policies supporting storage, to keep the lights on.”
Other key areas of reform recommended by the ESB include improving the use and incorporation of rooftop solar and batteries and upgrading the transmission network to reduce congestions for new large-scale renewables.
“We must upgrade the transmission network to realise the opportunities,” Schott said.
“We are already well progressed down this path through changes to the way we plan and develop the national grid. Further reforms are required to make the most of the new grid, manage future congestion and connect the new generation and storage needed as efficiently as possible.”
Schott said the ESB will continue to work with the AEMC, AEMO and the AER to progress reforms to the National Electricity Rules while the broader advice is considered by governments.
The timing for the release of the final advice will be determined by the Energy National Cabinet Reform Committee with federal, state and territory ministers to consider the recommendations and present a package for consideration by National Cabinet later this year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/29/spark-welcomes-takeover-talks-as-buyout-bid-reaches-5-2-billion/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 29, 2021",Spark welcomes takeover talks as buyout bid reaches $5.2 billion,"Spark Infrastructure has told shareholders it is in the company’s interest to engage in talks after a consortium including United States-based private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co delivered a third buyout offer which values the company at $5.2 billion.
The consortium, which also includes Canada’s Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, revealed its new, higher offer of $2.95 per security on Wednesday.
Spark, which owns a 49% stake in Victorian distribution operators Powercor and CitiPower, 49% of South Australia’s distribution network operator SA Power Networks, and a 15% stake in transmission network operator Transgrid in New South Wales, had previously knocked back two acquisition proposals from the consortium.
Spark said those bids – the initial $2.6375 and the follow up $2.7375 – undervalued the company but left the door open for an improved offer and provided the consortium with “limited information” on its business and its prospects.
The consortium has now provided a third offer that is almost 32 cents more than the first and represents a 26% premium on the closing price of $2.30 on July 13, the day before the first bid was received.
In an ASX announcement on Wednesday, Spark told shareholders it is in the company’s interest to continue to talk with the consortium and granted its suitors access to its books.
“Following careful consideration, and consultation with its advisers, the board of Spark Infrastructure considers that it is in the interests of Spark Infrastructure’s securityholders to engage further with the consortium,” Spark said in the statement.
“Accordingly, Spark Infrastructure has decided to provide the consortium with the opportunity to conduct due diligence on a non-exclusive basis.”
While Spark said it will engage further with the North American consortium, and allow it to complete the necessary due diligence, the company also made it clear that it was open to other approaches if this one failed.
“The board notes that there is no certainty that the engagement between Spark Infrastructure and the consortium will result in a control transaction,” Spark said in the ASX statement.
“The board remains focused on maximising securityholder value and will carefully consider any proposal that is consistent with this objective.
“Irrespective of whether the engagement between Spark Infrastructure and the consortium results in a control transaction, the board considers that Spark Infrastructure has a high quality and scarce group of regulated assets that have a very attractive future and is well positioned to continue to deliver an attractive yield now with franking credits.
“Complementing its reliable and inflation-linked revenues, Spark Infrastructure’s investment portfolio also has strong growth prospects in its underlying high-quality asset base and has strong ESG credentials given its important role in supporting the multi- decade energy transition to a lower carbon future.”
Until recently Spark was exclusively an investor in regulated network infrastructure but it has begun developing a portfolio of wind, solar and storage assets, targeting more than $1 billion of investment in renewable energy generation by 2025.
Earlier this month it announced plans to develop a 2.5 GW hybrid wind, solar PV and battery storage project in New South Wales while the 100 MW Bomen Solar Farm came online last year.
The company has also revealed it has plans to construct a 60 MW extension at the Bomen Solar Farm as well as a yet to be identified 150 MW solar+storage project and a 350 MW wind farm in NSW along with a massive 600 MW wind farm project in South Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/29/nrw-gets-nod-to-build-rio-tinto-solarstorage-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 29, 2021",NRW gets nod to build Rio Tinto solar+storage project,"Perth-based civil contractor NRW Holdings has been awarded the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract to deliver a 34 MW solar + battery energy storage system at Rio Tinto’s Gudai-Darri mine in Western Australia’s (WA) Pilbara region.
The project will comprise an estimated 100,000 solar panels accompanied by a 12 MWh lithium-ion battery energy storage system that will provide spinning reserve generating capacity to support a stable and reliable network.
With construction set to begin next month and conclude in 2022, the solar plant is expected to supply all of Gudai-Darri’s electricity demand during peak solar power generation times and approximately 65% of the mine’s average electricity demand.
Described by Rio Tinto as one of the most technologically advanced mines in the world due to its focus on autonomous operations, the Gudai-Darri mine will ramp up production from early 2022 to reach an annual capacity of 43 million tonnes of iron ore.
NRW chief executive and managing director Jules Pemberton said the $60 million solar + storage contract will demonstrate the Australian company’s ability to complete renewable energy projects.
“Securing this work recognises the broader delivery capability of the business and NRW’s long-standing experience of delivering projects for Rio Tinto in the Pilbara,” he said.
“Renewable energy represents an increasing opportunity for the group, in particular captive projects like this where the energy output is integrated to the client’s network.”
The works include the design, procurement, construction, testing and commissioning of all equipment associated with the solar energy system.
This includes a 33 kV substation which will be integrated into Rio Tinto’s overall infrastructure, including remote control and monitoring via the company’s remote operation centre in Perth.
The 34 MW solar farm will eventually be connected to Rio Tinto’s grid at the Gudai-Darri central substation via a 6km-long overhead powerline and fibre-optic link, which is not included in the NRW contract.

The project forms part of Rio Tinto’s commitment to reduce its carbon footprint, targeting net zero emissions by 2050. The miner has also installed a 6.7 MW solar facility at its remote bauxite operation in Weipa, Queensland.
“We continue to look for ways to reduce the carbon impact of our operations. Choosing renewable energy over traditional power generation, like we are doing at Gudai-Darri, is one of them,” the company said.
“Together with a new lithium-ion battery energy storage system, the solar plant is estimated to reduce our annual carbon dioxide emissions by about 90,000 tonnes compared to conventional gas-powered generation.”
NRW said this week that the design and procurement process for the solar farm has already commenced and construction is set to begin in August.
Construction and commissioning are scheduled for completion in early 2022.
Rio Tinto is not the only mining giant to identify the benefits of switching to renewables with a slew of operators recognising the value of solar PV.
BHP announced in January it had signed an agreement with Risen Energy for the 100 MWdc Merredin Solar Farm in WA to supply up to 50% of the miner’s electricity needs for its Nickel West Kwinana refinery over the coming 10 years.
That announcement came after it had signed a five-year energy take-off agreement to use green sources for half of its Queensland energy needs.
Fortescue Metals is also looking to renewables, announcing its Chichester iron ore mining hub in the Pilbara will be run entirely off renewable energy during the day, powered by a massive 60 MW solar farm coupled with a 35 MW/11 MWh battery facility.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/29/solar-manufacturers-warn-of-12-18-months-disruption-for-standalone-products/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",MAX HALL,"JULY 29, 2021",Solar manufacturers warn of 12-18 months disruption for standalone products,"From pv magazine Global
A survey of more than 30 off-grid solar product manufacturers has prompted predictions the disruption caused by materials shortages and raised shipping costs could continue throughout next year.
Netherlands-based off-grid solar body GOGLA – formerly the Global Off-grid Lighting Association – surveyed the suppliers of products such as solar lanterns, water pumps, TVs and fridges, as well as complete solar home systems (SHS’), last month, to ask about the impact of global chip shortages and other material-related issues.
Of the 24 companies which responded to a question about how long issues such as price rises, delayed deliveries, reduced product performance and stock shortfalls could continue, nine businesses said a year, eight said 18 months, and two respondents said two years. Five companies were more upbeat and predicted the turbulence would clear after the end of this year.
Although a well-publicised global shortage of chipsets and controllers – which feature in inverters – dominated manufacturer concerns, respondents to the GOGLA survey also mentioned rising polysilicon prices affecting solar panel production costs and an escalating copper price driving up the cost of cabling.
As a result, a dozen manufacturers said the performance of their products would be affected by material shortages, versus 15 respondents who said there would be no such impact. Changes to performance could include a need to “provide slightly less power [from] each [solar] module” as well as removing a dimmer feature for solar lights; replacing information displays showing remaining electricity credit with LEDs; and reducing cabling and mounting flexibility.
Manufacturers voiced concern about whether such changes to their products would affect the quality assurance guarantees issued by testing agency Verasol, given that can be a key requirement in the suitability of such items to receive donor funding.
With African installers having already told pv magazine about the rising project costs they are having to pass on to clients as a result of soaring shipping costs, respondents to the GOGLA questions predicted product price rises ranging from 9% for solar lanterns up to 52% for solar-powered TVs. An expected 14% price rise in the cost of full-service SHS’, and of 15% for water pumps, will cause further concern to NGOs aiming to get the world back on track with the fading UN ambition of universal access to electricity this decade.
Manufacturers also expect an 18% rise in the price of solar-powered fridges, a 16% hike in the cost of fans, and an 11% uplift in solar-powered multi-light systems, according to GOGLA, which announced the results of the survey this month.
In terms of supply disruption, manufacturers expected stock to be at its tightest for the rest of this year for SHS’, TVs and multi-light systems, although they predicted shortfalls will continue into next year. Solar water pumps are likely to be in short supply in the second half of next year, the respondents predicted. At present, manufacturers say, it is taking 2.5 weeks longer than usual to receive solar panels, there is a one-month delay in battery deliveries, and a 21-week hold-up for chipsets and controllers.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/29/stick-on-solar-panels-in-france-secure-eu-funding/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",MAX HALL,"JULY 29, 2021",‘Stick-on’ solar panels in France secure EU funding,"From pv magazine Global
SunPower-shareholder-controlled solar manufacturer Maxeon Solar Technologies has been named as one of 32 recipients who will split €118.6 million (AU$190.7 million) of EU grant funding to develop low-carbon technology.
With California-based controlling shareholder SunPower itself controlled by French energy giant TotalEnergies, the European money will go towards the cost of Maxeon using an existing manufacturing facility in Porcelette, northeastern France, to produce its frameless, glass-free, “sticky” Maxeon Air solar panels.
As reported by our pv magazine USA site in May, the Max Air panels are intended for use chiefly on roofs unable to host conventional modules. With a reported weight of 6kg/m2 and Maxeon claiming conversion efficiency of 20.9%, the company has estimated an unmet demand of more than 4 GW for the product in Europe, where the manufacturer said it would be available from the first quarter of next year.
The project description published by the European Commission yesterday stated Maxeon hopes to install 1.4 GWp of its Air modules over the next decade.
The exact amount of grant funding to be awarded Maxeon is due to be settled in the final quarter of this year, when the EU’s recently established Innovation Fund makes its first payments. The cash will come from the revenue generated by the EU’s emissions trading scheme, which sells certificates generated by renewable energy operators to companies who exceed their maximum permitted carbon emissions.
With the Innovation Fund expected to have around €20 billion to disburse to 2030, an additional €623 million is already available as unspent cash from predecessor the NER300, which had allocated those monies only for the associated projects to fall through.
Other low-carbon projects which will benefit from the Innovation Fund include a bid by Spanish energy companies Repsol and Enagas to develop technology which can directly use photoelectrochemical cells to electrolyse hydrogen from water without any external energy input.
The EU cash will also back the pooling of power purchase agreements associated with 12 off-grid, agrivoltaic, solar-powered irrigation systems in Spain into a collective 7.35 MW of generation capacity large enough to qualify for green bond financial support. That project is being overseen by Spanish infrastructure and renewables business Acciona.
The Spanish port of Motril will be awarded finance to help it become an off-grid renewable energy community harnessing 4 MW of solar capacity and 1.55 MWh of energy storage, in a project featuring Siemens; and German institute the Fraunhofer ISE, Italian energy company Enel and the body representing Rome’s airports are working on a plan to use second-life electric vehicle batteries to store the energy generated by a 30 MW solar plant at one of the city’s airports.
Luxembourg-registered steelmaker ArcelorMittal will also receive a slice of the grant funding, to help develop full production in France of its building-integrated PV product which combines photovoltaic generation with steel roofing.
Other projects approved by the fund include an Austrian plan to aggregate 2,781 electronic household and business devices into a 6 MW virtual power plant to provide grid services, a highly energy-efficient electrolyser in Poland to generate green hydrogen from on-site PV, and extensive vehicle-to-grid facilities in Italy and France. Swedish battery developer Northvolt will also receive funds to help manufacture lithium-ion batteries it claims offer 50% more energy density than conventional products while being 50% lighter. Production will be supported in Sweden and Poland.
As part of the Innovation Fund awards, EU lender the European Investment Bank will also offer technical support said to be worth €4.4 million to 15 companies whose projects are at an earlier stage, and including a Spanish system to store solar electricity using pumped heat. The Repsol and Enagas green hydrogen project is also among the 15 schemes to receive technical assistance, with the nature of the help also set to be determined in the final quarter of the year.
