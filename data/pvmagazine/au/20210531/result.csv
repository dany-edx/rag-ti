While battery storage has seen a 300% increase in the first quarter of 2021 compared with the last quarter of 2020; there has been a dramatic decline of investment in large-scale renewable projects, with financial commitments in large solar and wind farms falling to the lowest level seen in the past five years.
New England Solar farm near Uralla in New South Wales, was the only project to reach financial close in Q1 of 2021, and its 400 MW capacity is a 40% drop on capacity committed in the previous quarter and 30% lower than the 2020 quarterly average.

“Confidence for new investment in the sector is really in limbo at the moment,” said Clean Energy Council (CEC) Chief Executive, Kane Thornton, who cited projects experiencing “significant and often unanticipated delays through the grid connection process”; and government intervention in the energy market — as seen last week in the announcement of a new $600 million gas peaking plant to be built in Kurri Kurri — adding to “uncertainty for investors”.
Sally Torgoman, Infrastructure Lead Advisory for the energy practice at PwC, who provides commercial and legal advice to clients in the renewable energy field, agrees, saying grid risk must be factored into every stage of a renewable energy project.
She confirmed at a recent Smart Energy Summit that achieving grid connection for a large-scale development typically takes two to four years and costs upwards of $1 million; and that the risk posed by the grid continues into the operational phase of projects in the form of changing marginal loss factors (which measure energy likely to be lost between the point of generation and the point of demand — a reduction in revenue borne by the generator), the possibility of curtailment in response to grid instability and other possible requirements to mitigate problems with the grid.
PwC recently surveyed 50 renewable energy experts in the Australian market to discover whether everyone was having the same problems.
Torgoman says, “It’s very rare that you run a survey and get 100% of participants saying the same thing, but 100% of the experts said that the number-one issue in the National Electricity Market [NEM] is underinvestment in transmission and distribution, followed by slow grid connection processes.”

Speaking with pv magazine Australia today, Torgoman said investment was also likely to decline if there are no boundaries to the level of intervention the government might make in the market.
Recent Federal Government interventions have included investing taxpayer dollars in the development of Snowy 2.0, and more recently in development of a gas-peaking plant at Kurri Kurri on the Central Coast of New South Wales.
This despite this year’s research by the Clean Energy Council, which found that large-scale battery storage is superior — in reaction time, cost of operation, and emissions — to gas plants for delivering electricity peaking services
“In a market that’s really about managing supply and demand in a timely way, investors don’t know when the Government will plonk down another couple of hundred megawatts of assets to insure against closure of Liddell,” says Torgoman, “or whether it will allow the private sector to invest its own money to meet the approaching supply shortage.”
Monique Miller, Executive Director and Head of Solar and Dispatchable Renewables at the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, spoke after Torgoman at the Smart Energy Summit this month and said straight up, “Global investors are looking to double holdings in sustainable investments to 2025.”
Torgoman agrees that there’s “plenty of liquidity in the market and investors are very keen to invest in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) related projects, particularly in renewables.”
She and Thornton echo the voices of so many industry experts who say Australia has a tremendous opportunity to become the choice of renewables investors.
As Torgoman points out, “We desperately need new generation,” upwards of 40 GW of renewable energy simply to replace the output of retiring coal-fired power plants and meet electricity demand.
Investment in batteries also makes sense, she says, as they offer a number of benefits, including securing the stability of the grid, while allowing deferral of capital investment in major grid upgrades.
At this point in time, batteries also offer longer asset life than previously, and attractive pricing, such that the technology has come into commercial viability. Torgoman says, it’s become “good business to consider whether upgrading a power line or a substation can be dealt with more effectively with a battery.”

Battery energy storage also allows the time-shifting of excess renewable generation at certain times of day into low-generation, but high-demand periods, “but that actually means again that we have to remember the important role that transmission and grid connections play” she reminded Smart Energy Summit attendees.
“The grid is an unavoidable requirement,” Torgoman said.
Among the remedies to the “financially and psychologically” painful problems of effectively quantifying risks the grid in its current state poses to investors, says Torgoman, is a more transparent process that helps investors and developers understand the limitations and accordingly cost them.
She says the current multi-faceted, multi-party process of grid connection, for example — which puts the onus on investors to understand grid capacity and complex modelling — could be greatly clarified.
She also says that some parts of the process are up for interpretation, and yet there is no third-party to which one can refer a grid connection decision made within AEMO, for review. The result is that investors end up “having this one-way conversation that becomes quite hard”.
The CEC’s Thornton says the reduction in financial commitment to clean energy generation is “a deeply disturbing trend.” Just as countries throughout the world are recognising the need to accelerate their investment in renewable energies, the brakes are being applied to “Australia’s promise as a renewable energy superpower”, he concludes.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/31/new-commercial-e-vans-hook-up-with-evie-networks-charging-for-low-cost-low-carbon-delivery-services/,"EV,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MAY 31, 2021","New commercial e-vans hook up with Evie Networks charging for low-cost, low-carbon delivery services","If ever collaboration was needed it’s in the electric vehicle-meets-charging infrastructure space, and today the private St Baker Energy Innovation Fund (StBEIF), owner of charge-point operator Evie Networks (among other e-mobility- related investments), announced a $20 million investment in and partnership with TrueGreen Mobility, which has simultaneously launched its first mass-market commercial e-van into the market.
TrueGreen Mobility has the exclusive contract to distribute Chinese brand BYD electric vehicles in Australasia, and is taking orders for its first release, the BYD T3, with 800-kilogram carrying capacity, 100 km/h max speed and 300-kilometre range on a single charge (280 km when loaded to full capacity) — for delivery in September this year.
“As a business we’ve been pushing very hard to bring the right products to market,” TrueGreen Mobility CEO Luke Todd told pv magazine Australia. 
BYD’s new Blade Battery lithium-iron-phosphate chemistry was the clincher he says, with its 50.3 KWh capacity, and ultra-safe design which has passed stringent heat and piercing tests.
The Blade Battery is described by BYD as “high longevity”, and is claimed to efficiently handle 3,000 charging/discharging cycles, or be capable of covering 1.2 million kilometres, over its life cycle.
With the right battery on board, Todd says that, “The partnership with the St Baker Energy Innovation Fund allows us to bridge the critical gap in people’s reasons for not buying electric vehicles, which is access to charging infrastructure.”
Evie Networks, and ultra-fast charging technology manufacturer, Tritium (in which StBEIF also has an interest), “are about to move into their Metro phase, which will see hundreds of chargers installed in city and suburban areas over the months and years to come”, says Todd.
TrueGreen Mobility is in discussions with industry players such as e-commerce companies and their delivery contractors, where Todd says there has been pent up demand over the past two years for an emissions-free vehicle.
He estimates there are 3.4 million vehicles of 4.5 tonne or under plying Australian roads, of which around 70% are six years or older and entering the replacement stage of their lifecycle.
TrueGreen is issuing a “call to arms” to Australian operators with fleets that are high polluting, and doing a lot of kilometres around suburban and city streets, to decarbonise their vehicles, and consider installing depot charging infrastructure from Evie Networks.
Trevor St Baker says the partnership between Evie Networks, “installing Tritium ultra-fast chargers at key transportation hubs across Australia” and TrueGreen Mobility, “providing affordable and reliable vehicles”, means “Australia has reached the point of mainstream transition to zero-emission vehicles”.
The main internal combustion engine competitor to the BYD T3, says Todd, is the Toyota HiAce, which retails new at around $45,000, where the BYD T3 will come in at a fleet price of around $35,000.
“A switch to EVs makes perfect economic, commercial, environmental and moral sense,” urges Todd, who adds that e-commerce and similar high-mileage industries will significantly benefit from the lower operating costs and more efficient transport options offered by electric commercial vehicles.
TrueGreen is currently displaying the BYD T3 on its new open consumer-sales platform EVDirect.com.au, which it hopes will become the new online factory-to-consumer sales model for electric vehicles of all makes in the passenger and commercial space.
On EVDirect, buyers can also kick the tyres of the BYD EA1 Hatch, a passenger EV that will be available for order within a week.
The next light commercial vehicle to roll into this online showroom will be from Nexport, a sister company to TrueGreen Mobility, which is contracted to supply 70 electric buses to the New South Wales Government as part of its fleet upgrade to electric-drive vehicles.
The Nexport Logistics Truck, designed and engineered by Nexport itself, is a 4.5-tonne electric delivery truck with a 2-tonne payload, and will be launched in August.
Todd told pv magazine Australia that the $20 million investment by StBEIF in TrueGreen Mobility “is a figure”, but that the coming together of the two companies is the enabler of a “mass transition to electric vehicles, whether it’s commercial or consumer.
“Over the next 12 to 18 months Evie Networks is investing 10s to 100s of millions of dollars in rolling out their network. That’s why we’re making a big, big announcement, because we need Australian industry to get in behind us and support what we’re doing.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/31/critical-energy-transition-infrastructure-gets-the-regulatory-green-light/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MAY 31, 2021",Critical energy transition infrastructure gets the regulatory green light!,"Australia’s renewable energy industry is today celebrating the Australian Energy Regulator’s (AER) final approval of costs for Project EnergyConnect, the 900-kilometre South Australia to New South Wales (with a short spur into Red Cliffs in northwest Victoria) high-capacity electricity interconnector, which is forecast to unlock some 1,800 MW of renewable energy generation in its path, and create more than 2,600 jobs across the region.
“This is the first major electricity project to receive a green light under AEMO’s Integrated System Plan for the east coast,” said Rick Francis, Manager of Spark Infrastructure which holds a 15.01% interest in TransGrid, project developer on the NSW side of the connector. 
TransGrid today reached Final Investment Decision on Project EnergyConnect (PEC), as a result of the AER approval, and after having resolved a major hurdle in financing the infrastructure build with the support of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC).
The CEFC will provide a $295 million hybrid security instrument — the biggest investment it has made in its history — in the form of subordinated notes, which the Corporation said this morning has “contributed to the crowding in of further private sector debt to this critical project”.
Francis said that without the CEFC support, “TransGrid’s credit metrics would have been materially and negatively impacted, such that EnergyConnect would have been unable to proceed.”
That the project came so close to derailment, after years of planning and consultation which officially began with the Regulatory Investment Test for Transmission (RIT-T) project assessment draft report being submitted in Q2 of 2018, testifies to the insufficiency of existing procedures for bringing infrastructure to bear on energy transition requirements.
The pace of regulatory approval of infrastructure projects, which seeks to minimise costs to consumers, and anticipate developments that might make major investment infrastructure projects obsolete, has proven so slow that in February 2020, Victoria decided to introduce legislation that would allow it to fast-track priority projects such as grid-scale battery storage and transmission.
“Navigating a project of this type and size through the existing rules has exposed a number of fundamental flaws in the regulatory process that must be addressed if necessary investment in critical new transmission infrastructure to unlock further renewable generation is to continue,” said Francis from the investor perspective.
Aside from providing a metaphorical superhighway of connection opportunities for large-scale renewable projects in previously lane-grade grid constrained but high-resource areas; and aside from generating thousands of jobs in both PEC construction (up to 1,700 jobs) and resulting renewable energy build out (an estimated 950 jobs in the region), PEC’s benefits as listed by the CEFC also include:
Rick Francis said, “As a long term investor,” Spark Infrastructure is “excited” by the opportunities inherent in the project.
ElectraNet, the South Australian partner in PEC, today also welcomed the Australian Energy Regulator’s approval of the expenditure required to deliver the $2.28 billion project, including $457.4 million for ElectraNet to construct the SA section of the interconnector.
It said, “The ElectraNet Board will review the determination by the AER and consider its final investment decision on the project in the coming days.”
In New South Wales, TransGrid has finalised its Engineering Procurement and Construction contract with SecureEnergy for construction of its larger component of the interconnector, which will stretch from the border intersection of SA, NSW and Victoria, through Buronga (where a branch will be built to connect to Red Cliffs in Victoria), and on to Wagga Wagga.
SecureEnergy is a 50/50 joint venture of two international engineering and construction groups: Australian firm Clough, and Spain’s Elecnor.
Construction of the project is expected to commence late this year, and to achieve commissioning in 2023.
Kane Thornton, Chief Executive of renewables industry body the Clean Energy Council, commented today, “While it’s great to see Project Energy Connect progress to this stage … The pace of change in the energy transition warrants a major overhaul of the regulatory process for transmission.”
He highlighted the importance of other transmission projects identified in the Australian Energy Market Operator’s Integrated System Plan, to enable coordinated and reliable operation of a grid based on clean energy generation.
Once up and running PEC will abate “an estimated one million tonnes of carbon emissions each year,” said TransGrid CEO, Paul Italiano, “contributing significantly to meeting Australia’s climate change targets.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/31/australias-energy-storage-installed-base-to-grow-more-than-five-times-by-2030/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"MAY 31, 2021",Australia’s energy storage installed base to grow more than five times by 2030,"Growth in residential energy storage systems (ESSs) is driven by customers installing energy storage alongside rooftop solar amid some of the highest global electricity prices, expiring feed-in tariffs (FITs), subsidies, and concerns over resilience.
By adding energy storage, customers can maximize the amount of solar that they self-consume (rather than export to the grid) as well as enjoy off-grid power when power from the grid is cut off. Being cut off from the grid is increasingly becoming a concern from remote communities or homes with the frequency and severity of bushfires increasing.

An estimated 15% of Australian households have had rooftop solar systems installed by 2020. New solar installations paired with an ESS is becoming the new standard, particularly as the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) debates whether to impose charges on exported power from homes at particular times.
Front of the Meter (FTM) installations will be largely driven by projects colocated with solar. ESSs colocated with renewables will drive 55% of the FTM forecast between 2021 and 2030. The value of avoiding curtailment, which occurs when voltage levels fall too low – the plant trips due to sudden changes frequency levels or the network service provider needs to manage congestion on the network – increases the value of having dispatchable solar assets. These are being promoted by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). This is in part driven by the expected retirement of 7 GW of thermal capacity by 2030 and a further 6.2 GW by 2035.
However, operating hybrid projects under the AEMO’s standards is complex, which creates barriers to entry, and can delay project commissioning. Therefore, for many of the colocated projects the assets will be operated independently, meaning the assets may share a grid connection but otherwise have limited interaction.
Additionally, BESSs can capitalize on the volatility recorded in frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) or wholesale markets. Most battery energy storage systems (BESSs) in Australia will be utilizing merchant markets, primarily focused on the FCAS in addition to arbitraging prices in the wholesale market when prices spike.
On average, frequency services make up 85% of revenues for currently operational BESS, however a wide range of revenues are possible from the wholesale market, where average net returns from price wholesale arbitrage can be anywhere from AU$39/kW to $211/kW (US$27–245/kW) depending on the year, the state, average number of cycles, and duration of the system.
Increased demand during the summer months paired with generators tripping under hot conditions or as a result of bushfires or storms, often causes summer prices to spike as high as AU$14,500/MWh (US$9,974/MWh) in wholesale markets. For example, on January 31, 2020, when transmission lines in South Australia unexpectedly tripped when a tornado hit, FCAS prices spiked to over AU$1,000/MW (US$691/MW) multiple times throughout the day. This event alone created over AU$60 million (US$41 million) of revenue for all operational BESS in Australia.
One significant issue often overlooked is the challenge in securing financing for these large scale BESS. In fact, despite making up the majority of revenues for existing operational systems, FCAS revenues are often not considered bankable enough to be taken into account in the business case – meaning some other revenue stream must form the basis. This has meant that the majority of operational FTM BESS today have some form of government funding, usually from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), or are turning to fixed contracts for system security services to provide a fixed baseline revenue.
Another growing trend in Australia is the utilization of ESS to defer investments into network infrastructure. This is applicable to both FTM and BTM solutions. Where BTM standalone power systems (SAPS), typically solar PV plus a storage system, are replacing new lines to the fringe of the grid homes and farms (buildings or towns are often only connected by a single electricity line). Or FTM where large-scale ESS are aiding with congestion and mitigating outages on transmission lines. This is an issue that will only grow as the amount of renewables installed increases in a grid with such a dispersed population.
Overall, IHS Markit continues to see Australia as a key growth market for both BTM and FTM ESS driven by the fundamental need to support such a distributed electricity network that is rapidly transitioning away from thermal power to renewables. However, the market remains volatile as federal level policies still do not fully align with rapid transition that state governments are pushing for.
Additionally, the slow – relative to the speed of renewable installations – transition in market structure paired with the perceived risk in merchant markets creates challenges to develop bankable business cases for large scale BESS.
* The article was amended on June 1, 2021 to correct the figure 2.8 GW to 12.8 GW: “In its latest report, IHS Markit predicts that energy storage installations in Australia will grow from 500 MW to more than 12.8 GW by 2030.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/31/rystad-doubles-iea-calculations-on-solar-pv-required-by-2050-think-50000-twh/,"EV,HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MAY 31, 2021","Rystad doubles IEA calculations on solar PV required by 2050 — think 50,000 TWh","On 18 May the International Energy Agency released the first global Net Zero by 2050 roadmap, which was requested by the UK Government’s COP26 leadership in advance of the UN Climate Change Framework Convention in Glasgow in November. The comprehensive 224-page report anticipates that solar will deliver 23,000 TWh of the 71,000 TWh forecast electricity generation needed by 2050, becoming the world’s single largest source of total energy supply.
Rystad Energy’s own global analysis was delivered before the IEA’s Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector, at its live streamed seven-hour Energy Transition Marathon on 6 May, and therefore was not influenced by it, and does not represent a rebuttal — more a genuine opportunity for comparison of the assumptions and methodologies of the two landmark studies.
In just such a comparison, released last Thursday, Rystad describes itself as “much more bullish on the rise of solar PV capacity” than the IEA, predicting more than twice as much solar, or 50,000 TWh, should be installed by 2050, on the basis that “the world needs to grow its power generation capacity further in order to fulfil electrification goals in buildings, transportation and industry and solar PV is the cheapest and most convenient way”.
Only two weeks ago at the Smart Energy Conference in Sydney, solar guru, Professor Martin Green who made the University of New South Wales a global hub of solar efficiency development, confidently asserted that by 2023 solar generation “should be at 10 cents a watt” becoming the cheapest form of energy the world has ever known.
The IEA and Rystad Energy predict that wind and solar will collectively grow to make up around 70% of primary energy by 2050, with wind generation contributing 20,000 TWh by 2042.
While the IEA sees emerging renewables, such as biomass, geothermal, concentrated solar and marine energy, growing to 5,600 TWh of capacity by 2050, Rystad Energy predicts they will only achieve around 1,900 TWh, because they’ll be simply eclipsed by the cost competitiveness of solar — which will naturally grow solar’s piece of the pie.
“In our model, solar PV with batteries will be preferred ahead of expensive and inflexible sources like nuclear, biomass and geothermal,” says the Rystad comparison. It calculates that the cost of growing energy production capacity by 3,000 GW from 2030 to 2050 by deploying a combination of nuclear, biomass, geothermal, marine and hydro power — as posited by the IEA — would cost US$5-8 trillion, whereas “getting the same capacity added through solar PV including batteries will only cost US$2 trillion”.
Image: Rystad Energy
Both teams of analysts foresee the peak investment level for fuel production and electricity generation hitting around US$2.2 trillion in around 2030.
There are many projections on which the IEA and Rystad independently agree, and consensus from two such respected agencies that have the resources and expertise to conduct comprehensive analyses inspires a level of confidence in their modelling.
Points of difference such as the amount of solar capacity required and the future demand for oil provide extra guidance and potential for adjustment.
The IEA forecasts that oil demand will average 95 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2021, remaining flat until 2023 and declining from there to 72 million bpd in 2030 and 24 million bpd in 2050.  
Rystad on the other hand foresees a road traffic comeback of 0.8 million bpd in 2022; and for that to be mitigated to meet IEA forecasts it says the global electric vehicle (EV) fleet would need to grow by 35 million cars by mid 2022, “which cannot be achieved given the current production capacity of about 6 million vehicles per year”.
To achieve its projected fall in oil demand, the IEA assumes large-scale behavioural change in people deciding to drive less, pursue air travel far less frequently, and buy substantially greater numbers of EVs — it posits 64% EV sales as a 2030 milestone; and it expects biofuel to replace some 6 million bpd of oil used in transportation.
But Rystad mostly argues against such scenarios, saying, for example, that the required tripling of biofuel capacity to achieve such a reduction in oil demand, is “very unlikely as production technologies for advanced biodiesel are still under development”.
It says dramatic behavioural changes in human mobility/travel are also implausible. 
However, it ups the ante on the potential effect of EV sales, saying that if EVs could reach 72% of new sales in 2030 — presumably via substantial government incentivisation programs — and if society could steadily substitute clean tech in other transportation sectors, it sees a path for oil demand to drop to 72 million bpd in 2038; 36 million bpd in 2050; and 10 million bpd in 2066.
“Should that happen,” writes Rystad Energy, “the 1.5 degree target will still be within reach.”
Where the IEA calls for cessation of investment in new fossil fuel supply projects from the time of the release of its Roadmap, and sees no need for development of new oilfields, Rystad identifies that continued demand from shipping, aviation, haul trucks and the petrochemical industry, which will be slower to transition to clean fuels en masse, will put the brakes on reduction in the demand for oil and require new oil projects to deliver some 10 million bpd of oil from new fields in the 2030s.
On other fossil fuels, both organisations confirm the decline of coal, with the IEA predicting coal consumption will be reduced to half the current rate by 2029; Rystad is less bullish saying that 50% rubicon will only be crossed in 2037.
Both organisations also seem to share a gas gauge: predicting a 40% decline in consumption of natural gas by 2040, and a more than five-fold increase in hydrogen (colour code unspecified) consumption by 2050.
The Rystad take on an international plan for reducing emissions only strengthens the urgency of the IEA message.
To have a chance of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees “requires the immediate and massive deployment of all available clean and efficient energy technologies”, concluded the IEA
Where the IEA pathway calls for annual worldwide additions of solar PV to reach 630 GW by 2030… “equivalent to installing the world’s current largest solar park roughly every day”; Rystad says  — make that two mega solar parks every day.

“Amber’s partnership with CBA is a big step towards our goal of helping a million customers save money while shifting Australia to 100% renewables,” said Dan Adams, Co-founder and CEO of Amber, who added that the funding will accelerate the company’s reach and product development.
Amber offers customers a subscription of $15 a month to its app, which provides access to real-time wholesale energy prices and the percentage of renewable energy flowing through the National Electricity Market (NEM) at any given moment; this enables them to adjust their consumption to take advantage of times of cheap renewable generation, rather than paying a flat fee they’ve negotiated with a conventional retailer for their energy.
All energy market transactions are handled by Amber, which passes on the wholesale electricity prices — including network charges, metering costs, environmental costs and carbon offsets — exactly, transparently, as they are incurred by Amber as the retailer.
Amber subscribers can also opt in to be paid for solar exports to the grid, at the wholesale rate the market is offering at the time of export, and the company provides forecasts of energy price spikes (so consumers can shift non-essential energy use to other times), and likely low periods (so they know when to set all electrical loads humming).
“We need to give people an incentive and the technology to use cheaper renewable power when it’s available,” says Adams, and at the same time increase demand for construction of new renewable energy projects.
More than an investment, the CBA partnership will, over time, facilitate Amber offering its service to CBA customers; and Amber is set to collaborate with CBA which provides low-cost finance to bank customers who want to buy battery storage for their solar systems, smart electric vehicle (EV) chargers and other intelligently enabled electrical devices.
Through its partnership with Amber, CBA will “help our customers see how their energy costs are calculated, help them save money on their energy bills and help them use renewable sources of energy”, says Commonwealth Bank Group Executive, Angus Sullivan.
Amber is currently building and trialling its new SmartShift technology with 1000 customers; SmartShift will optimise the use of smart devices and automate load shifting into renewable-energy windows of opportunity in the NEM.

Earlier this year, CBA announced the Commbank Green Loan facility, which aims to help customers invest in renewables.
The loans of up to $20,000, at a 0.99% fixed interest rate, are set up to be repaid over 10 years, and incur no upfront fees, or monthly service or early repayment charges.
“We recognise the important role we play in supporting Australia’s transition to a low carbon economy,” said Sullivan.
CBA was also the first Australian corporate to join the global RE100 program, committing to being powered 100% by renewables by 2030, a goal it achieved 10 years ahead of schedule on 1 January 2020.
With its million-customer goal within reach, Adams says that volume of members would enable the Amber collective to “shift enough demand to replace an entire coal-fired power station with wind and solar farms”.
