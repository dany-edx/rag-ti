Ross Garnaut is a big beast in the Australian climate policy world, and a Labor favourite since his days as economic adviser to Bob Hawke. His 2008 Climate Change Review shifted the dial on policy, encouraging the Rudd and Gillard governments to pursue carbon pricing laws. He fell out of favour when the Coalition, led by Tony Abbott and dominated by climate science deniers, defeated the Labor government in 2013 on the back of a carbon price scare campaign.
Now he is back with a follow-up to Superpower: Australia’s Low-Carbon Opportunity (2019), an optimistic vision to turn Australia into “a global superpower in energy, low-carbon industry and absorption of carbon in the landscape.”
The Superpower Transformation is promoted as a “practical plan” to put the vision of Superpower into effect. Garnaut has been joined by six experts, who cover various elements of the plan to slash Australia’s emissions to zero and build a new energy economy that will also materially aid the rest of the world.
Australia, Garnaut argues, is blessed with a superabundance of the five endowments we and the world need for the zero-carbon energy and industrial revolution now getting underway.
They are:
Garnaut argues that if we follow “the Superpower pathway” not only can Australia reach net-zero emissions well before 2050, we could also export zero-emissions goods and services that could directly reduce global emissions by around 8%.
That’s a big number. As Garnaut points out, it is more than Europe can do by going net-zero. In fact, he says, it is big enough to “materially improve” the world’s chances of preserving “the political order on which we all depend.”
The bold claims multiply. Following the blueprint set out in Superpower Transformation would end the climate wars. It would restore Australia’s lagging prosperity, insulate us from global energy price volatility, bring full employment and rising living standards. It would enhance national security. In short, the Superpower pathway is “a bridge […] from policy incoherence to hope and opportunity.”
If this suggests an evangelising tone to Garnaut’s vision then perhaps we need to glimpse the promised land to keep our spirits up, as the warnings from the scientists become grimmer by the month and the country is ravaged by floods, fires and heatwaves.
Back in 2008, Garnaut’s major review for the states and the Rudd government was very good on the science, but weak on targets. It urged the world to aim for an overshoot strategy of 550 parts per million of atmospheric CO2 before winding back to 450 parts per million, consistent with warming of 2°C. He was heavily criticised for going soft on targets in the pursuit of politically calibrated advice to the new Labor government – advice Australia was meant to take to the world.
Now he has gone the other way. Instead of overshooting, Garnaut has adopted the stringent goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, as per the 2015 Paris agreement. With a new federal Labor government that appears to take its climate policy obligations seriously, we can expect this new book to be studied by those helping to formulate and implement policy.
Despite the ambitious goal and bold claims made for the Superpower pathway, when Garnaut gets to actual policy advice he becomes more cautious. He tiptoes along what he sees as a feasible path. On the touchy subject of banning new coal mines and gas fields, he says we should not interfere in the investment plans of private corporations, although we should make them pay for their fugitive emissions.
Garnaut takes the view that the massive emissions from Australia’s exports of coal and gas are not our business, because the nations that burn them are responsible. It is a position consistent with the Kyoto rules and the government’s stance, but it is increasingly out of step with progressive climate thinking.
Still, when he doesn’t have an eye on the Albanese government, the visionary goal of Garnaut’s blueprint for Australia’s future shines through. When we get to the end of his long opening chapter (admittedly a slog), we emerge feeling uplifted and encouraged.
When we turn the page to Chapter 2, however, we step out of the warm bath of hopeful possibilities and into a cold shower of real emissions trajectories.
A chapter written by Malte Meinshausen – perhaps Australia’s leading authority on budgets and pathways – and his colleagues Zebedee Nicholls, Rebecca Burden and Jared Lewis crunches the numbers on the world’s and Australia’s permissible carbon budgets. It sets out to answer the question: “Will the transition be swift enough to avoid catastrophic climate outcomes?”
While progress has unquestionably been made since the 2015 Paris conference, a far-reaching direction change in each of the big polluting nations must occur this decade if there is to be a chance of getting anywhere near 1.5°C.
Meinshausen and his co-authors consider what would be needed if Australia is to do its fair share – a share that was determined in the 2014 report of the Climate Change Authority to be 0.97% of the global carbon budget (I was a member of the CCA at the time). They tell us bluntly that the new government’s 43% by 2030 target is inconsistent with our international commitments.
In fact, across the globe, national targets are “woefully inadequate” and Australia is certainly not up there with the leaders. We may no longer be a laggard, but we are loping along in the middle of a slow-moving pack.
The authors also tell us that “strong policies are needed to get Australia most of the way to net zero by 2035”. Yes, 2035. That is the year by which the bulk of the emission cuts need to be achieved. The remaining cuts get much harder, requiring a ladder or two to access the high-hanging fruit. The authors don’t say it explicitly, but the message is pretty clear. Australia will not cut its emissions deeply enough and quickly enough to make its fair contribution to the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C.
Garnaut is upbeat about the possibilities for storing a lot more carbon in Australia’s soils and vegetation, and he is supported by a rose-coloured chapter on land carbon by Isabelle Grant. But Meinshausen and his colleagues, in a concise and hard-hitting breakout box, remind us that any offsets from sequestration must be genuine and permanent. Permanent means that wherever we put the captured carbon, it must still be there in 1,000 years if it is to offset emissions from burning fossil fuels.
They are sceptical. Take forests: they must be free from fires, disease, droughts and beetle attacks, all of which are more likely in a warming climate. The authors note that only putting carbon into safe and secure geological reservoirs “comes with a high likelihood of permanence”. In a crushing final two pages, they conclude that under any reasonable or even optimistic set of assumptions, the Superpower pathway cannot be achieved. Instead, Australia will have to do things beyond cutting domestic emissions if we are not to be punished by the international community.
What things? We could contribute more to the “loss and damage” fund to help poor countries cope with the disasters we have helped cause. We could send green technologies and energy transition minerals to developing countries (not for free, of course). Finally, we could compensate for our excessive consumption of the global emissions budget (which has left less for others) by “a strong program in sustainable negative emissions.”
This is a bit odd, since the authors have basically canned land-based sequestration, and geological carbon capture and storage at scale remains a pipe-dream, not least because it would entail the construction of a vast and resource-intensive industrial infrastructure to offset some of the damage being caused by the other vast and resource-intensive industrial infrastructure.
By the end of chapter two, we wonder whether the hope Garnaut kindled in us is, in fact, hopium.
Superpower Transformation is an important contribution to the extensive energy transition literature. Yet, like most of that literature, it implicitly characterises climate change as an externality or unpriced cost (a very big one) of an otherwise functioning system.
As an orthodox economist, it is no surprise that Ross Garnaut should have faith in the prevailing political-economic system and the perpetual economic expansion on which it relies. In fact, rather than question the sustainability of the growth project, one of the promises of Superpower Transformation is that it will increase Australia’s rate of economic growth.
It is uncomfortable to be reminded that, of the nine planetary boundaries that delimit the safe operating space for human societies to continue flourishing, four have already been breached and one more, ocean acidification, almost certainly will be. The planet’s regenerative capacity and its ability to absorb our waste are now stretched way beyond sustainable limits.
The huge investments that will go into the new energy revolution, with a disproportionate amount in Australia, will reduce carbon emissions. Yet the resources needed for the energy transition, and the waste generated by it, are both enormous. The volumes of alumina and iron ore needed to enable the necessary expansion of the electricity transmission network are alone staggering.
There is a chapter in Superpower Transformation by geology professor Mike Sandiford that begins by hinting at the dark side to decarbonising the economy – that is, the “extraordinary increases in supply of the critical energy transition metals”. But the chapter peters out without coming to grips with how that can work.
Garnaut estimates that the solar farms needed for net zero in Australia would cover 3.75 million hectares – “shockingly large,” he writes. The life span of solar panels is 25-30 years, meaning they have to be replaced with new ones every 25-30 years, or perhaps much sooner because newer ones are better. That means bulldozing the landscape across Western Australia and Queensland to extract the metals needed to replace the solar panels, a process that will never end.
At present, it costs around USD 20-30 to recycle a solar panel and USD 1-2 to send it to landfill. Unless rapid progress is made on recycling technologies for solar panels, we will soon face an enormous waste disposal problem, a “solar trash wave”.
Human population is almost eight billion and is expected to reach almost 11 billion by the end of the century, with each human on average consuming more of the planet’s remaining resources. Already, the stresses on the oceans are reaching extreme levels. Some 90% of global fish stocks are fully exploited or overexploited. The oceans are warming and acidifying. In places, they are heavily polluted and contaminated by plastics.
So there is something wrong with the system that drives our economy and guides our lives. We need technofixes such as those detailed in Superpower Transformation, yet the fear remains that investment in clean technologies can never keep up with the resource demands of exponentially rising global consumption.
Something’s gotta give: either humans radically change the way we live on the planet or the Earth system that sustains us will break beyond repair, if it hasn’t already.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/10/victorian-neighbourhood-battery-plan-to-maximise-benefits-of-solar-boom/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 10, 2022",Victorian neighbourhood battery plan to maximise benefits of ‘solar boom’,"Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced his government would spend $42 million (USD 26.9 million) to install 100 neighbourhood batteries in communities across the state if it is re-elected on Nov. 26.
Fifteen of the batteries will initially be installed in Melbourne and 13 in regional Victoria. Labor said it has committed to work with community groups, local governments and distribution companies to identify locations for the remaining 72 batteries.
The rollout of rooftop solar in Victoria is among the most impressive in Australia with more than 200,000 Victorians having already installed solar panels on their roof. As many as one in every five homes have a solar system installed, generating enough energy to meet a third of Victoria’s total residential electricity demand but Andrews said the batteries will allow more residents to share the benefits of the “solar boom.”
Andrews said the neighbourhood batteries are expected to triple the number of Victorian homes with access to storage, allowing more to return surplus solar-generated electricity to the grid through feed-in tariffs.
“It means more households will have access to cheaper renewable energy, even if they don’t have their own solar panels,” he said. “We think about 25,000 households will benefit from this.”
If we're re-elected, we'll install 100 neighbourhood batteries across the state.
It'll drive down power bills and reduce our reliance on coal.
We're doing watt matters.
— Dan Andrews (@DanielAndrewsMP) November 10, 2022

The batteries build on the neighbourhood batteries the state government has already delivered in Fitzroy North, Yackandandah, and those currently being built in Tarneit and Phillip Island.
Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said the government planned to install all 100 batteries within the next term should it win another four years in office. She said the batteries will drive down power bills but did not put a dollar figure on how much.
“The more neighbourhood batteries that we have, the cheaper the cost will be of poles and wires that they’re required to pay off their bills, and of course the energy that they use,” she said. “We know that that’s … one of the key solutions to us meeting our ambition to get to 95% renewable energy by 2035 and net zero emissions by 2045.”
The neighbourhood battery announcement comes after Andrews recently declared plans to revive the government-owned State Electricity Commission (SEC) as part of its election plans on energy. It also announced it will target 95% renewables by 2035, with at least $1 billion to be spent on delivering 4.5 GW of renewable energy projects.
That came after the state government announced it will target 2.6 GW of renewable energy storage capacity by 2030, and 6.3 GW by 2035.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/10/origin-board-to-back-brookfields-18-4-billion-takeover-bid/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,CANADA,UNITED STATES",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 10, 2022",Origin board to back Brookfield’s $18.4 billion takeover bid,"The board of ASX-listed Origin on Thursday announced it plans to “unanimously recommend” that shareholders vote in favour of an $18.4 billion takeover bid from a consortium comprising Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management and United States-based gas supplier MidOcean Energy. The $9-a-share cash offer represents a near 55% premium on the energy gen-tailer’s closing price of $5.81 on Wednesday.
Origin said it will open its books to the consortium of Brookfield and MidOcean Energy, which is managed by United States-headquartered energy infrastructure investment giant EIG, with “due diligence expected to complete within eight weeks.”
“Should Origin receive any proposals which the board considers may lead to a superior outcome for Origin shareholders, these will be evaluated,” Origin said in a statement.
Origin chairman Scott Perkins said the proposal, which comes after an initial approach in early August of $7.95 a share, “confirms that Origin, its operations and management team represent a highly strategic platform, well-placed to benefit from the energy transition”.
“Our confidence in Origin’s prospects underscored our engagement with the consortium and delivered a material increase on their initial offer,” he said. “While the due diligence process advances, we will remain focussed on the successful execution of our strategy.”

Origin’s business includes electricity generation, power and gas retailing and a 27.5% a stake in liquefied natural gas joint venture, Australia Pacific LNG.
Under the proposal, the bidding partners would split the business, with Brookfield taking Origin’s energy generation and retailing businesses while MidOcean would acquire Origin’s gas business, including its interest in Australia Pacific LNG.
Brookfield said if the proposal is successful, it would invest an additional $20 billion in Origin to fund its clean energy transition plan and build renewable energy and firming generation capacity through to 2030.
Brookfield’s Asia Pacific chief executive Stewart Upson said the energy transition in Australia presented a “once-in-a-generation” investment opportunity “but that investment needs to be accelerated materially in order to meet Australia’s legislated climate goals.”
“Origin is a very high-quality business with a strong management team that, when combined with Brookfield’s large-scale capital and global renewable power development expertise, is uniquely placed to contribute significantly to Australia’s net zero targets,” he said.
“Brookfield has the global renewable power expertise and access to capital to support Origin’s transition strategy. Our business plan includes additional investment of $20 billion by 2030 to build the required renewable capacity and storage and position Origin as Australia’s leading ‘greentailer’.”

The bid comes after Brookfield earlier this year was part of an unsuccessful offer to buy Australian energy giant AGL for $8 billion, which came with a pledge to spend a further $10 billion to $20 billion building large-scale renewable energy to fast-track the closure of the company’s coal-fired power stations.
Origin chief executive Frank Calabria said the takeover bid, which would rank among the biggest private-equity-backed buyouts of an Australian company, comes after Origin made several strategic moves in the past year that have strengthened its balance sheet, sharpened its strategic focus and “positioned the company to prosper from the energy transition.”
“We believe Origin is in a strong position to lead the energy transition, capture opportunities and create value for shareholders,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/10/super-fund-to-tip-100-million-into-green-hydrogen-projects/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,TASMANIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 10, 2022",Super fund to tip $100 million into green hydrogen projects,"ASX-listed ReNu Energy and its wholly owned subsidiary Countrywide Hydrogen have inked a term sheet with Australian super fund HESTA for the potential investment of up to $100 million in a portfolio of green hydrogen projects being developed in Tasmania and Victoria.
Countrywide, which was acquired by ReNu in February, has two projects under development in Tasmania and another two in Victoria. The Victorian projects include 10 MW electrolyser facilities at Melbourne and Portland while the Tasmanian projects include a 10 MW electrolyser plant in Bell Bay and a 5 MW facility at Brighton near Hobart.
Countrywide has also signed an agreement to work with large-scale solar PV and battery energy storage specialist Wirsol Energy to investigate solar-to-hydrogen co-development opportunities in Tasmania.
ReNu chief executive officer Greg Watson said the company’s vision is to be a major green hydrogen supplier domestically, with a primary focus on supplying hydrogen to the mobility and natural gas sectors, and then to use its Australian learnings to expand to export and offshore projects.
“We are excited to have HESTA on board as an institutional investor in our green hydrogen projects,” he said. “Our task now is to advance to definitive agreements as soon as possible and progress commercial discussions with our project partners for green hydrogen offtake.”
The executed term sheet is a non-binding framework that is intended to be converted into definitive arrangements, subject to HESTA completing its due diligence. It sets out the parties’ intention to jointly pursue green hydrogen projects and to advance to definitive agreements.

Under the conditions of the new term sheet, HESTA, which manages more than $68 billion in assets invested around the world, will commit up to $100 million for the development of green hydrogen projects.
ReNu and its subsidiary Countrywide Hydrogen will be responsible for delivering and operating the projects. ReNu will also be responsible for securing debt and grant funding while HESTA will be granted first right of refusal to invest in existing and new projects.
Countrywide managing director and ReNu Energy executive director Geoffrey Drucker said HESTA’s investment illustrates that the momentum for the transition to clean energy and the decarbonisation of economies and industry is growing.
“HESTA’s support will enable the group to progress its hydrogen projects from concept to production and meet its objective to be the first-mover in domestic green hydrogen production to the identified markets of road transport, decarbonising natural gas networks, and up to 100% green hydrogen use in industrial applications,” he said.
HESTA chief investment officer Sonya Sawtell-Rickson added that the agreement is part of the super fund’s strategic commitment to invest in projects that not only deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to its members but also support the transition to net zero emissions.
“We continue to look for opportunities like this to invest in innovative technologies and businesses that will support the transition to a low-carbon future,” she said. “By providing innovative climate solutions, this investment will also serve our members’ best financial interests over the long term.”

Renewable energy corporate PPAs in the Asia-Pacific region are set to reach a record 7 GW of capacity in 2022, according to a new report by energy research company Wood Mackenzie. That corresponds to an 80% increase on 2021. In the second half of 2022, corporate renewables procurement is on pace to increase by about 4 GW.
Solar dominates renewable corporate PPAs in the region, accounting for 57% of contracts.
“However, wind has been catching up since 2020 and accounted for 44% of new contracts in the region in the first half of 2022,” the report says.
In Australia, solar and wind account for 45% and 43% of PPA contracts, respectively. Solar dominates in India, with 82% of contracts. Wind – particularly offshore wind – accounts for 89% of total capacity in Taiwan.
“For the remaining countries in southeast and east Asia, solar accounts for nearly all contracted capacity,” said Wood Mackenzie.
As of the first half of 2022, India, Australia, and Taiwan were the top three markets in the Asia-Pacific region’s cumulative corporate PPA procurement capacity, accounting for 89% of the total, or 18.6 GW. India leads the charge, with 8.1 GW. Australia has 5.2 GW, while Taiwan has 3.2 GW.
Other countries account for the remaining 2 GW of contracted capacity, with Singapore, China, and Thailand completing the top six. South Korea, Cambodia, and Pakistan contracted the least capacity in the first half of 2022.
“In most Southeast Asian countries, including Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan and the Philippines, PPAs are rooftop solar projects,” the report explains. “These are of limited size, reducing their contribution to capacity.”
The top developers in Asia’s corporate PPA market are Amp Energy, Amplus Solar, and Cleantech Solar. They have the vast majority of their capacity in India, according to the report. Most developers in the region are domestic and regional players. The key clients for PPAs are large energy users in the industrial, retail, and technology sectors.
“In Australia, companies including BHP and Newcrest use PPAs to power their mining operations,” says the report. “Other big users include supermarket chains and telecoms providers who use renewables to power their data centres.”
The Asia-Pacific region’s renewable corporate PPA capacity accounts for 15% of the global PPA market. The main barrier for further growth in corporate PPAs in the region is lack of regulation permitting large-scale procurement of renewables, according to Wood Mackenzie.
“Countries including South Korea, Japan, and China are all gradually easing regulations surrounding offsite corporate PPAs, which should open up opportunities in the coming years,” it says. “However, we expect Australia, India, and Taiwan to continue to lead future growth.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/10/quantitative-methodologies-to-assess-technical-risks-in-pv/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE PV,GERMANY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 10, 2022",Quantitative methodologies to assess technical risks in PV,"From pv magazine Global
A group of scientists led by German standards body TÜV Rheinland has compiled an extensive review presenting all semi-quantitative and quantitative methodologies that are used to assess technical risks in PV systems.
The researchers based their analysis on three methods that are commonly used to quantify the impact of technical risks. They considered failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), which is a tool used to determine the effect of each module failure on system operation, in order to identify and implement corrective actions. They also considered reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM) analysis, which is an engineering tool used to address operational and safety issues in systems. In addition, the researchers adopted the cost priority number (CPN) approach by using the metric CPN, expressed in euros per kilowatt per year, instead of the risk priority number (RPN), which is a numeric assessment, generally used in FMEA, of risk assigned to a process.
The academics created a risk database covering the range of affected components, the description of causes and consequences, failure rates, the probability of occurrence, the impact on key performance indicators (KPIs), and the recommended control and mitigation actions.
“It should be updated and maintained as a growing data hub through all phases of the project,” they said.
They also used the Trust-PV Risk Matrix, which is a standardised taxonomy to improve and standardise the categorisation and the readability of operation and maintenance (O&M) tickets, to describe 30 examples of common technical risks. These examples were then included in newly developed PV failure fact sheets (PVFSs).
“The risk matrix covers all failures and events in the operational phase of a PV plant and is subdivided according to components, subcomponents and individual events/failures,” the scientists said.
They outlined their review in “Identify, analyse and mitigate – Quantification of technical risks in PV power systems,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. They said they aim to increase the knowledge of methodologies to assess technical risks and mitigation measures, in order to investigate the most important risks by collecting case studies and updating the database with the acquired information.
“With the knowledge acquired and data collected, the risk and cost-benefit analysis was demonstrated in one case study that showed methods for prioritizing decisions from an economic perspective and provided important results for risk managing strategies,” they explained. “However, providing an overview of quantification methods, we draw the conclusion that more standardization is required.”
