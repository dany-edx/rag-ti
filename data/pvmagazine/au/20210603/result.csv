“It’s as if the gearbox has failed on CS Energy’s 20-year-old car,” QCC director Dave Copeman said.
“Why would they spend money on an inefficient car approaching the end of its life when they could buy something more reliable, cheaper and fit for the future? CS Energy should upgrade to a Tesla.
“Large-scale storage could have helped us … by responding almost instantaneously to the loss of Callide C.”
The explosion at the Callide C coal-fired power station in late May caused chaos across Queensland’s electricity system.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has revealed the incident tripped multiple fossil-fuel generators, including the nearby Callide B, and another six coal-fired units at the Stanwell and Gladstone generators, leaving an estimated 477,000 homes and businesses without power.
CS Energy CEO Andrew Bills said crews had been working on site at the Callide Power Station this week to bring the three intact generating units back online but there was still no explanation for the explosion.
“It is too early to speculate as to the cause of the incident and we need to undertake a thorough and comprehensive investigation working with all authorities and regulators to determine the cause of this incident,” he said.
“There will be multiple stakeholders investigating what has occurred at Callide and we need to ensure it is a coordinated, comprehensive and independent process.”

Bills said the three intact units at the Callide Power Station will be back online within weeks while it is expected to be at least 12 months before the damaged C4 unit is operational. The Callide B units will be returned to service on June 11 and June 21 respectively while the C3 unit at Callide C, which CS Energy owns in a 50/50 joint venture with InterGen, will return to service on June 22.
Bills confirmed it remains CS Energy’s intention to rebuild the damaged unit, despite reports suggesting the cost of repairing the unit could be as much as $200 million.
Copeman was critical of the decision, saying CS Energy had written down the value of Callide C by nearly 50% last year, as it was unable to compete with new large-scale renewable energy projects and rooftop solar which are continuing to push wholesale energy prices down.
“Rebuilding Callide C4 in an over-supplied, unprofitable market for coal would be sheer perversity on behalf of the Queensland Government,” he said.
“We urge them to work with CS Energy and private partners, Intergen, after the situation at Callide is stabilised, to set out and fund a transition plan to ensure workers and Queenslanders benefit from the energy transformation.”
Queensland Greens MP Michael Berkman has also called on the State Government to divert the millions required to repair Callide C towards a big battery and a transition package for displaced workers.
“Spending $200 million on propping up coal would be throwing good money after bad,” he said.
“Coal is increasingly expensive and unreliable. For the cost of patching up this out-of-date technology, Queensland could have another big battery.”

Under the Greens’ plan at least $150 million would be set aside to build a big battery while $50 million would be allocated to assist workers affected by the early closure of the coal-fired power plant:
“We know that early closures will be necessary for the State Government to meet even its 50% renewables target by 2030,” Berkman said.
“At the moment New South Wales is planning Australia’s biggest battery – let’s go one better and build the biggest right here in the Sunshine State.”
Queensland does not currently have a big battery but the 100 MW/150 MWh Wandoan South Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) project, being developed on the Darling Downs by Singapore-based Vena Energy, is nearing completion with connection to the transmission network now in the final stages.
The State Government has also announced the state-owned energy company Stanwell is progressing plans to develop a 150 MW/300 MWh battery adjacent to the Tarong Power Station near Nanango in the South Burnett.
AGL Energy plans to build a 100 MW/150 MWh battery next to the 453 MW Cooper’s Gap wind farm near Kingaroy while Neoen is planning to build 150 MW of battery storage as part of its proposed 460 MW Western Downs Green Power Hub to be constructed near Chinchilla and has also submitted plans to develop a 100 MW battery project in Queensland’s far north.

Energy and Environment Minister Matt Kean said the State Government has committed $78.9 million to support the development of the New England REZ, with the northern NSW city of Armidale at its centre, set to become Australia’s largest renewable energy zone.
“The New England REZ is a fundamental part of our Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap and we expect it will deliver up to 8,000 megawatts of new capacity, $10.7 billion in private investment, around 830 operational jobs and 1,250 construction jobs to the local economy,” he said in a statement.
“Now is the time for all energy infrastructure proponents to register their interest as we take the first vital steps to deliver the New England Renewable Energy Zone.”
The New England REZ is one of five renewable energy zones included in the NSW Government’s electricity Roadmap, which is forecast to support more than $32 billion of private investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission in the state.
REZs will also be developed in the South-West, Hunter-Central Coast, Illawarra and Central-West Orana regions and are expected to bring 12 GW of renewable energy and 2 GW of storage online.
The Central-West Orana REZ, which is tipped to deliver 3 GW of renewable energy, was the first of the REZs to be launched with the call for registrations of interest last year attracting 113 registrations, totalling 27 GW and valued at $38 billion.
The New England region has already attracted a host of large-scale wind and solar projects, including the Walcha Energy Project, a 4 GW wind, solar and pumped hydro energy storage hub put forward by Energy Estate and its partners.
Joint venture UPC/AC Renewables Australia has achieved financial close for the first 400 MW stage of the New England Solar Farm while Spanish developer Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV) is progressing with the 115 MW Metz Solar Farm.

Member for Northern Tablelands Adam Marshall welcomed the launch of the ROI process, claiming New England has some of the best natural energy resources in the country.
“The ROI will help ensure the design and delivery of the REZ reflects the unique features of our region, and protects our precious local assets, such as our highly productive agricultural land,” he said.
The ROI is expected to provide vital information for the planning of the New England REZ including the estimated investment value, location and types of projects looking to connect. Early forecasts indicate it will deliver 6,300 construction and 2,800 ongoing jobs, mostly in regional NSW.
“The registration of interest process will help the government understand the scale, location and types of projects considering joining the New England renewable energy zone,” Marshall said.
“The information provided will support technical design, planning and further market engagement on the zone.”
The call for registrations of interest in the New England REZ will close on July 16, 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/03/pilbara-project-signs-on-to-green-hydrogen-certification-scheme/,"HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 3, 2021",Pilbara project signs on to green hydrogen certification scheme,"Norwegian chemical company Yara confirmed on Thursday it will look to have its renewable hydrogen and green ammonia production and export facility in Western Australia’s Pilbara region certified under the Smart Energy Council’s (SEC) Zero Carbon Certification Scheme.
Launched in January, the certification initiative is designed to provide a guarantee of origin for hydrogen, ammonia and other renewable hydrogen-based fuels and materials as Australia seeks to establish itself as a global hydrogen export hub.
In the months since its launch, the certification scheme has emerged as a globally significant initiative, with the United States-based Ammonia Energy Association among those to have signed up as a founding partner while the German Energy Agency dena has linked as an adviser.
SEC chief executive John Grimes said the certification scheme is a critical part of establishing green ammonia as a viable energy source for decarbonising the global energy system.
“The Zero Carbon Certification Scheme is a certificate-of-origin scheme for renewable hydrogen, renewable ammonia and renewable metals. It’s an absolutely critical step in building the industries of the future,” he said.
Yara Clean Ammonia vice-president Sammy Van Den Broeck described the SEC and Hydrogen Australia-led certification initiative as a “groundbreaking project” and said it will be essential to creating a market for green ammonia.
“The initiative will provide guarantees to our customers in Asia, Australia or Europe that the quantities supplied have been produced according to set standards and will inform the customers about key attributes such as renewable origin and greenhouse gas footprint,” he said.
“Certified clean ammonia exports from our Pilbara asset will be a cornerstone in Yara’s global trading ammonia network, providing customers in shipping fuel, power, fertiliser and industrial solutions with a reliable and transparent product.”

Yara is one of the world’s largest fertiliser companies, with operations in more than 60 countries. It expects renewable ammonia will gradually replace conventional ammonia and nitrogen products which are primarily used in fertiliser and as chemical feedstock. Yara expects a premium market for renewable ammonia to be developed within the next decade. Moreover, ammonia can be used directly in combustion and indirectly as a hydrogen carrier, presenting enormous potential in transport and shipping.
The company’s Pilbara plant is one of the largest ammonia production facilities in the world, producing 850,000 tonnes a year of ammonia and supplying approximately 5% of the traded ammonia in the global market.
The plant currently relies completely on natural gas for its hydrogen supply but Yara has teamed with French renewables giant Engie to construct an 18 MWp solar PV farm at the Barrup Peninsula site which would provide renewable hydrogen to feed the plant.
Scheduled for completion in 2023, the first phase of the project will see the construction of the solar farm, a 10 MW electrolyser and a battery storage system that will allow the plant to operate without being connected to the main electrical grid.
This $70 million phase is expected to produce 625 tonnes of renewable hydrogen and 3,700 tons of ‘green’ ammonia per year.
It is envisaged this will serve as a demonstration project as part of Yara’s roadmap for climate neutrality by 2050.
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) recently provided a $42.5 million grant for the project while the WA Government has provided $2 million grant to assist with site selection, permitting and stakeholder engagement.
The Yara ammonia project will be the second project to be certified under the SEC’s Zero Carbon Certification Scheme, after ActewAGL’s renewable hydrogen refuelling station in Canberra.
The Yara project is one of a number of renewable energy developments being pursued in the Pilbara.
The State Government has approved the 26 GW Asian Renewable Energy Hub which, among other ventures, aims to produce green hydrogen for export to Asian markets, while oil and gas producer Woodside has also unveiled plans to build a 100 MW solar PV facility to help power its Pluto LNG export facility and the Proposed Perdaman Urea Project.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/03/telsa-boss-declares-australia-can-power-renewable-energy-age/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 3, 2021",Tesla boss declares Australia can power renewable energy age,"Tesla chairwoman Robyn Denholm said she expects the United States-based company to spend more than $1 billion a year on Australian lithium, nickel and other critical minerals needed to make its batteries but said Australia should be developing its onshore refining capabilities to maximise the value of its resources seen as critical to the clean energy transition.
“The opportunity for Australia is extraordinary, and now is the time to seize it,” Denholm told a Minerals Council of Australia event in Canberra on Wednesday.
“Australia has the minerals to power the renewable energy age throughout the world in the coming years.”
Denholm said Tesla already sources three quarters of the lithium it uses from Australia and more than one third of its nickel. She didn’t specify a dollar figure for the current spend but said it is expected to increase as the carmaker continues to expand its renewable technologies offerings, including residential and grid-scale battery energy storage systems.
“We expect our spend on Australian minerals to increase to more than $1 billion per annum for the next few years,” she said.
Denholm said Australia supplied almost 50% of the world’s lithium ore last year at a value of about $130 million but supplied none of the refined product required for batteries.
“If it was processed onshore in Australia, the value would have been more like $US1.7 billion ($2.2 billion),” she said.
“It will require massive innovation. We need to scale up at an extremely fast pace and mining needs the same kind of innovation as the industries it supplies.”

The CSIRO has also urged Australia to focus on value adding to the supply chain, a new report declaring increasing demand for critical mineral resources can drive the nation’s renewable energy sector and overall economic growth.
The Critical Energy Minerals Roadmap estimates the metal value of the energy transition’s top technologies to reach more than $5 trillion dollars globally by 2050, over half of that being battery metals, with greater value potential for manufacturing products like cathodes for batteries or polysilicon for solar PV cells.
CSIRO’s mineral resources director Jonathan Law said Australia is well positioned to benefit but can significantly increase the value of its mineral exports, enable more local manufacturing and strengthen global supply chains.
“Rather than just extracting the minerals and shipping them away to be refined and turned into products, Australia has a real opportunity to operate all the way along the energy value chain, from extraction to processing, separating, refining and manufacturing high value materials and products,” he said.
“Connecting our mining and manufacturing sectors can create an investment ecosystem that supports domestic supply chains and resource circularity for our critical minerals.”
Australia’s exports of hard rock lithium, known as spodumene, are expected to hit $1 billion this year while its nickel exports are expected to be valued at $4 billion.
The Minerals Council of Australia has forecast demand for critical minerals is set to increase dramatically in the coming years as the world’s transition to renewable energy accelerates.

In its Commodity Demand Outlook 2030 report released this week, the council predicts the demand for Australian-mined lithium will rise rapidly, from 313 kiloton of lithium carbonate equivalent in 2019 to 1,465 kt by 2030. The demand for nickel is also expected to rise sharply by 67% from 2.4 Mt in 2019 to 3.9 Mt in 2030.
Denholm said the increased global uptake of electric vehicles (EVs) as nations target net zero emissions highlights the scope for growth.
“Electric vehicles account for less than 1% of vehicles globally at the moment,” she said.
“To reach net zero emissions, that needs to be much closer to 100% within 30 years. So that’s at least a 100-fold increase ahead, just for vehicles.”
Denholm said that shift would, by 2030, generate a global lithium-ion battery market of $400 billion.
“That’s eight times the revenue generated by Australia’s coal exports in 2020,” she said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/03/ihsm-clean-energy-insights-high-module-prices-and-shipping-costs-jeopardize-2021-installation-outlook/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JUNE 3, 2021",IHSM clean energy insights: High module prices and shipping costs jeopardize 2021 installation outlook,"IHS Markit currently maintains its 181 GW installation forecast for 2021. Our down case scenario for 2021 is 156 GW (down case still 9% growth Y-o-Y) with demand spill over to 2022 and uneven impact of higher costs across different markets.
The current environment poses a significant threat, but it is too early to tell what the consequences will be since the solar industry has faced other crisis before (e.g. COVID-19 in 2020) and showed extreme resilience and continued growth despite all challenges.
The price on module raw materials started to rise in July 2020 and has significantly impacted module costs from Q4 2020. Market expectation was that production costs would decline from the second quarter of 2021, dropping module quote prices, but we have seen just the opposite. The supply chain is experiencing further price peaks for some materials in Q2 2021 including polysilicon, copper, or steel, among others. The rise of raw materials is putting additional pressure on module makers who are only passing part of this higher cost into customers and adjusting utilization rates to control the rise of materials due to an overheated market.
In this high-price PERC environment, we are seeing a revival of demand for multicrystalline BSF, a technology that was being phased out, and that has seen its demand and prices increase in some utility markets (e.g. India, Middle-East) and even in C&I applications. The IHS Markit view is that this increase in demand and prices for BFS multi is a short-lived phenomenon triggered by extraordinarily high PERC prices and multi will continue its phasing out in 2022, remaining a product for some niche markets due to lower efficiencies.
While the trade imbalance between China and Western markets is not a new phenomenon, the rapid surge in goods demand in Western markets from very low demand during lockdowns to high demand during relaxations of COVID-19 restrictions and reopening of economic activity has caused serious challenges to logistics. Freight costs have increased 3-4 times in the last 3 quarters for shipments from China to Europe or the Americas and IHS Markit projects the situation will not dramatically improve this year.
This is a global phenomenon that is impacting all industries (semiconductors, automotive, consumer electronics…). The most recent IHS Markit global survey of manufacturers found that the stretching of supply chains in the last quarters has extended delivery times to the highest level in more than 20 years of data availability with delays being most pronounced in Europe, United States, and Taiwan. Solar PV is one of the most impacted due to the high concentration of manufacturing in China. Freight costs and long lead times might challenge solar project completions in 2021, delaying projects to 2022. Higher freight costs are also impacting other system components like trackers, which are a high-weight and low-value component, with final impact on total system CAPEX.
In this high-price environment that started in Q3 2020, international developers are putting off procurement in the hope that equipment and freight prices will be lower in 2022. Extreme volatility in raw materials, module prices and freight costs are not helping manufacturers nor developers to close contracts whose terms change on a weekly basis.  Given long lead times, if procurement is delayed beyond the summer, the risk to the 2021 installations outlook will become a reality.
In previous years, if demand slowed down around the summer and inventories grew, this triggered a price decline that quickly reactivated the procurement process. This year, however, even if inventories start growing and manufacturers would be willing to scarify margins, this would still have a small impact on the total module cost for a developer. Module costs for a developer will still be high due to the unchanged high cost of freight that will remain flat or could even increase in the second half of the year with the reactivation of economies in Europe and the United States.
High component and high freight costs are having a direct impact on CAPEX and project IRRs, which is expected to continue in H2 2021. This could be the first year where global average solar CAPEX might not decline after major Y-o-Y reductions in the last decade. Although developers are trying to delay procurement as much as possible, there is a significant part of the project pipeline under PPA contracts or schemes that require completion in 2021. In some cases, developers are accepting lower IRRs than originally forecast. In others, EPCs might decide to pay penalties for project delays – which could represent a lower cost than proceeding with building on time in the current price environment. The final decision depends on a variety of factors (company type, contract terms, possibility to lower other CAPEX contributors, etc) and cannot be generalized.
IHS Markit forecasts that Europe and India are the regions that are at a higher risk of underperformance. Europe faces the highest risk of being the most impacted by high component pricing, costly shipping, and long lead times since regional market growth hinges on the progression of the highly sensitive utility-scale segment and many contract negotiations and shipments are now paralyzed. The US market is at a lower risk since it is less price sensitive, but it is also being impacted by long-lead times and the surge in freight costs and higher prices that could push some project completion to 2022.
Finally, despite a low-connection first quarter, mainland China—unburdened by shipping challenges—should stay on course to grow on a Y-o-Y basis. However, IHS Markit remains cautious that additional module price increases, some recent bidding prices reached higher than 1.70 RMB/W, could put at risk the 2021 installation forecast that is strongly skewed to the second half of the year.

Project EnergyConnect is great news for the continuation of world-leading renewable energy integration in SA, an integration which the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) sees as a blueprint for energy planners around the world in the transition to renewable energies. 
In a new report titled “A Grid Dominated by Wind and Solar Is Possible – South Australia: A Window Into the Future”, IEEFA sets out seven vital lessons the world can learn from SA after the state’s large and small scale variable renewable energy generation grew from 0% to 60% in 14 years. Even more remarkable considering the Labor government elected in 2002 set a 2020 target of 26% renewables. 
40% of homes in South Australia have rooftop solar, meeting 13% of SA’s grid demand in 2020. In the same year, 4% came from utility-scale solar, and 42% came from wind, with the remainder coming from gas generators. 

Coal’s baseless baseload 
One of the report’s co-authors, DER specialist Gabrielle Kuiper, said SA has “shown that 100% solar generation is possible during the daytime to meet users’ energy demands.” In particular, the report states, SA “shows that the historical concept of a ‘coal baseload’ is not necessary for a reliable electricity system.” 
And not only is coal not necessary, but it’s no longer cheap either. From 2017 to 2021, IEEFA reports that SA’s increasing proportion of low-cost renewables has seen wholesale electricity prices drop 65%. 
The report’s author, Johanna Bowyer, said “Coal was phased out in 2016. Today the grid is dominated by wind and solar backed up by battery storage and interstate grid connectivity, with peaking gas being used as a temporary generation technology until South Australia moves to net 100% renewables.” 

Good policy opens markets 
The second lesson the world can take from SA, according to IEEFA, is that SA’s rapid transition was driven by “supportive government policy and particular features of the regional market”. 
Policies like the national Renewable Energy Target, the South Australian rooftop solar feed-in tariff, and the Home Battery Scheme, have pushed SA onto a path where it is expected to reach net 100% renewables by 2025, five years ahead of its 2030 target. 
Throw in Project EnergyConnect, referred to at the top of this article, which is expected to unlock 1.8 GW of renewable energy along its path and save SA households another $100 on their annual energy bill and $60 for NSW households. 
Ambition is key 
Not only is SA on target to meet its 2030 renewable energy target by 2025, but the state has also set a target of 500% renewables by 2050, with the aim of becoming a renewable energy export superpower. This is to say, exporting excess renewable energy to neighbouring states via Project EnergyConnect exporting green hydrogen, green steel, and other low emissions productions internationally. 
Moreover, IEEFA points to SA’s ambition, for instance in the Home Battery Scheme, as the reason why it has attracted companies like Sonnen and Alpha-ESS to build manufacturing and assembly facilities in SA. 
Renewables are reliable, renewables are secure 
IEEFA also points to SA as an example of a jurisdiction with high renewable energy penetration which has been reliable and secure. 
Part of this success can be put down to the Hornsdale Big Battery which has been able to respond rapidly to fluctuations, proving an enormous success for SA and an equally enormous financial success for Tesla and Neoen. 
SA now has four grid-scale batteries in operation with two more on the way, and the SA energy minister Dan Van Holst Pellekaan is not yet satisfied, telling ABC Four Corners Fired Up, “we’ll get more and more of those.” 
Indeed, the only year in the last 15 in which SA didn’t meet its reliability standard was 2008-2009 when extreme temperatures brought several states’ infrastructure to its knees. “This shows reliability can be maintained in a 60% variable renewable energy grid” the report concludes. 
The report also pointed to the state’s high penetration of rooftop solar as producing a flood of distribution network innovation. “Productive innovations have included LV monitoring, transformer tap changes, and especially the development of dynamic operating envelopes (DOESs)” Kuiper said. 
However, the report was not lax on the innovations, investment and regulatory adjustment that is still necessary. Although, one of the regulations IEEFA took truck with in particular was the 2020 regulation which required rooftop solar inverters to be capable of remote disconnection by the market operator. “IEEFA has raised concerns regarding the technical need, economic efficiency and lack of social licence for this regulation,” the report says. 
“Long term planning for a digitalised, zero-inertia, zero-emissions system needs to start now in order to avoid unnecessary regulations or investment in technology that may become obsolete,” the report continued. 
The transition to a zero-emissions and zero-inertia grid with ready demand response and “optimisation of both large scale and distributed energy resources has yet to be achieved anywhere in the world,” Bowyer noted. “South Australia has the potential to achieve this outcome within a decade with thoughtful planning and policy.” 

So, to reiterate, IEEFA’s seven vital lessons were:

Spain-based mounting system provider Alusín Solar has developed an adhesive mounting structure for rooftop PV systems which it says is applicable to any kind of solar module.
The system is currently being tested on a 9.8 MW self-consumption solar project under construction by Spanish utility Endesa, which is part of Italian energy company Enel.
The main advantage of the system is that the roof is not perforated in any case. “As no holes are made, the risk of leaks is eliminated, which [is] something very important, for example, in ham-drying rooms,” the general director of Alusín Solar, Javier Font, told pv magazine.
Alusin Solar
The Gulpiyuri 30 system is made with aluminium bars that, instead of being fixed to the roof with screws, are attached through a double-sided adhesive. According to the manufacturer, this adhesive guarantees the necessary mechanical resistance and durability to mount the aluminium profiles that will hold the solar panels. Font affirms that the system works for any type of solar panel “because the structures adapt to any panel.”
The system was used for the first time two years ago, in Cantabria. Inekya was the EPC and Sice Renovables the installer. “The first project was developed in 2019 and remained in embryonic mode until they commissioned us [for] this great project, which served as an accelerator”, says the director of Alusín Solar.
The system must be installed with a particular cleaning technique. “All aluminium profiles must be cleaned with a specific product with a high alcoholic base to ensure that we remove any type of oil or dirt,” Font further explained. “Then, a specific primer is applied to them and, finally, the double-sided adhesive is glued to the profiles.”
The profiles leave the Alusín Solar factory in Asturias with one side already glued. To ensure perfect fixation, a gluing machine is used to apply a specific pressure. Once the material arrives on site, the roof is thoroughly cleaned. “It is the most critical process and for this a roller machine is used that cleans under pressure with 225 bars,” Font added. “Then, the other side of the profile is glued to the roof cover.” Once the profile has been glued, a 25kg roller must be passed onto it. This way a correct adherence is ensured and the solar panels are installed as with a conventional system.
But the novelty does not end there, according to Font. “During the assembly process, we installed a series of witnesses, indicators, which will allow us to monitor the system and visualise its ageing from year to year to see how it behaves,” he went on to say. “We have … anchor measurement equipment adapted for this type of test and, with this system, we accompany the client throughout the entire useful life of the installation.”
