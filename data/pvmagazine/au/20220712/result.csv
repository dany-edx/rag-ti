The technology – which is by no means novel – has received renewed attention across Europe and places like New Zealand as the question of how to decarbonise industrial heating comes into sharp focus. Around 44% of Australia’s final energy consumption comes from industry and of that 52% is used for process heat, according to consultants ITP. 
The Australian Alliance for Energy Productivity, an industry and government not-for-profit alliance, was recently engaged by Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) to conduct modelling into the potential of heat pumps for Australia. It found that while, of course, heats pumps are no silver bullet, the technology could cut a “nice chunk” from Australia’s most difficult to abate emissions, the Alliance’s CEO Jarrod Leak told pv magazine Australia.
Moreover, Leak said heat pump technology has been poorly modelled in the past, leading to them being “grossly underestimated.”
Its modelling found in fact industrial heat pumps are both economically and technically feasible for applications where the required heating was below 90˚C,  and are often a superior solution to solar thermal or biogas.
There is a continued perception that heat pumps are too expensive to be viable for industry though – something Leak disputes, saying the issue often lays with system oversizing and a lack of data. We’ll come back to this shortly, but first it’s worth looking at the technology’s most insidious issue: its bad reputation.
Unlike many other technologies needed for decarbonisation, Leak says heat pumps will need to overcome their sketchy legacy to be embraced in Australia. 
Poor quality installs and equipment, as well as other issues with programs rolling out heat pumps, have given the technology a bad name in some circles. What’s worse, Leak fears these issues persist.
“There’s a whole bunch of cheap and nasty heat pumps that don’t work and are poorly supported,” Leak said. “There’s an offer on Facebook now to get a new heat pump for $33 because of a government rebate, and normally they cost about $3,000.”
Online, complaints revolving around heat pumps abound – something all but guaranteed to worsen with the installation of $33 systems. 
According to Leak, there isn’t enough being done in Australia to introduce minimum standards for heat pump technology – something our neighbours New Zealand are already addressing. 
This legacy, Leak says, has led to a cautiousness among government bodies and leaders, who are reluctant to fully endorse the technology.
Since the uptake of heat pumps in Australia remains comparatively low, there is also an education – or more specifically behaviour change – component.  “It’s a different way of heating your house,” Leak says, noting that the heating offered from heat pump systems isn’t radiant like a gas heater, nor is it immediate. Rather, heat pumps need an hour or so to heat or cool a room and the temperature change is far more ambient. 
With the introduction of smart homes and the capacity for remote appliance control, these issues could become less pronounced – though few politicians today brave suggesting behaviour changes to their constituents. 
Even with those issues, Leak believes the residential rollout of heat pumps is vital – even if industry is where most of the benefit lays.
This is because, Leak notes, there’s very little attention is paid to industry technologies. Moreover, the case for heat pumps in residential houses is far easier and more compelling than for commercial buildings. Often, moving to heat pump technology is “not an easy transition for a lot of commercial buildings,” Leak admits.
This is because commercial buildings usually lack the data needed to correctly size a heat pump.
“Because the technology on per kilowatt installed basis is somewhere between five and 10 times more expensive than traditional [boilers], you need to be more careful with it,” Leak says.
“You cannot just flippantly change like for like.”
Leak says there is potential for heat pump technology to move further down the cost curve – though those savings would largely come from manufacturing. “There’s not much happening in terms of the technology but on the supply chain,” he says, noting suppliers optimising their manufacturing locations and an increase in uptake would further depress costs.
“But it’s not a cost curve like solar PV,” he said. Where heat pumps and solar are alike though, is in the savings which come from increased installation proficiency – from which solar in Australia has been a massive beneficiary – and for which there is certainly room for heat pumps prices to depress, according to Leak.
As is often the case with emerging technologies, government support is crucial. But compared to New Zealand, where the federal Government Investment in Decarbonising Industry fund (GIDI) fund has committed NZ$650 million (AU$590 million) to renewable process heating, about a quarter of which goes towards heat pumps, ARENA has spent only about $3 – $4 million, Leak estimates.
Part of this lack of funding is because of ARENA’s remit, which limits it to expanding renewable energy supply. Since heat pumps don’t strictly generate renewable energy, but rather support their application and reach, projects applying for ARENA funding would need to couple their heat pumps with a Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) component from a clean generator.
Another battle for heat pumps is with the perceived shine of the technology. Put simply, heat pumps just aren’t that sexy as other new technologies and their potential investment market is far more modest.
“We’re not talking billions,” Leak said. “When you talk about solar, hydrogen, batteries, it’s billions of dollars. We’re talking in the hundreds of millions of potential for, say, annual investment [in heat pumps].”

Cathode precursors are engineered materials which tend to be one of the highest cost components of a battery cell. 
The pilot plant is the “culmination of several years of hard work,” Future Battery Cooperative CEO Shannon O’Rourke said, and it seeks to capitalise on the fact Australia, particularly Western Australia, produces all the elements needed for modern batteries.

Located at Curtin University in Bentley, just south of Perth, the pilot plant has been supported by 19 industry, research and government groups.
Over 18 months, the plant will run a series of test campaigns through four fully integrated and automated precursor cathode active material (P-CAM) production units, provided by German chemical giant BASF. 
The four units will enable the plant to run different compositions and ratios of chemistries simultaneously, or to run the same chemistries under four different conditions, changing variables such as temperature, pH or stirring rate, the Future Battery Cooperative said.
The produced precursor cathode active materials will then be lithiated, calcined and electrochemically tested at the Queensland University of Technology’s Electrochemical Testing Facility.
The global battery market is expected to grow nine to 10 times by 2030 and 40-fold by 2050, the Future Battery Cooperative and WA government both note in their releases on the news. This would equate to roughly $23 trillion being spent on the technology before 2050.
Australia is unique in that it is home to all the raw materials required to make high performance batteries including lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese and graphite, so it makes sense for the country amass more of the battery value chain in the form of processing and manufacturing.

While the economic case is self evident, it’s worth noting battery material refineries have been criticised for their environmental impacts – which may be why most of the chemicals processing has tended to be done in developing countries, with China easily holding the lion’s share.
Western Australia is rapidly embracing downstream processing for batteries though. Earlier this year, Australian miner IGO and China’s Tianqi produced its first batch of battery grade lithium hydroxide at its Kwinana refinery in WA. (IGO is also listed among this pilot plant’s project participants).
Mineral sands miner Iluka Resources also reached a final investment decision to proceed with the construction of its first rare earth oxide refinery, the Eneabba Rare Earths Refinery, this year.
The Future Battery Cooperative believes establishing an active materials manufacturing capability in Australia could deliver $1 billion to the economy and support 4,800 jobs by 2030, according to its report Future Charge — Building Australia’s Battery Industries.
The pilot has been supported by BASF, BHP Nickel West, the CSIRO, Queensland University of Technology, Curtin University, and the University of Technology Sydney among others. 
The WA government has also committed $13.2 million to facilitate global investment in precursor cathode manufacturing, it noted.
“Australia has the potential to develop into a competitive player in the international batteries industry. The Pilot Plant launch is a significant step in developing the onshore capabilities and industry knowledge to create thousands of jobs and add billions of dollars to our economy,” Shannon O’Rourke, CEO of the Future Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre said.

A research group from China has shown how proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis could be combined with thermal energy storage to maintain a high-efficiency operating range for electrolysers when renewable energy is connected to hydrogen production systems.
PEM electrolysers cannot maintain stable operating temperatures as input power changes, as the polarisation curve distorts with the change of temperature.
“This work proposes a PEM electrolyser coupled with the thermal energy storage device to meet power fluctuation and frequent start and stop caused by renewable resources,” the scientists said.

The proposed system consists of a 60 kW PEM electrolyser, a water separation subsystem, a purification subsystem, a heat storage subsystem, a pressurising subsystem, and a controlling and monitoring subsystem. It can operate in normal mode and power fluctuation mode.
“A throttle valve is used to reduce pressure at the outlet of the oxygen path,” the team said. “Concentration detection and alarm devices are also installed around the platform to ensure the test safety.”
The water separation subsystem consists of hydrogen separators and oxygen separators.
“Hydrogen and oxygen flow out from cathode and anode, respectively, with a certain proportion of liquid water, and enter the primary separator for gas-liquid separation,” the academics said. “The function of the separator is to make the gas change direction suddenly in the flow, separating water droplets from the gas.”
The heat storage subsystem can store heat through a plate heat exchanger. This heat can then be used for PEM electrolysis when input power fluctuates. The pressurising subsystem is used to overcome the resistance loss of the circulating water system, which makes the water continuously flow in the loop.
The scientists tested the system maintaining the water flow into the electrolyser at 200 mL per minute per cell. They found that it presented a higher current density under the same power consumption, leading to a higher hydrogen yield.
“The inlet water temperature of electrolyser reached around 58 C in 30 seconds and promoted the electrolytic system to run quickly and persistently in an efficient condition,” they said. “Meanwhile, the coupled system can effectively reduce electrolytic voltages during the process of start-stop or load changing, and the maximum difference of power consumption per cell can reach around 12 W.”
They presented their findings in “Experimental and Analytical Study of a Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyser Integrated with Thermal Energy Storage for Performance Enhancement,” which was recently published in the International Journal of Photoenergy.
“The coupled system effectively reduces energy consumption in the process of start-stop or load changing, which can effectively adapt to the power fluctuation and frequent start and stop caused by renewable energy,” the scientists said.

India’s AmpereHour Energy has released MoviGEN, a new plug-and-play mobile energy storage system. The lithium-ion-based system provides on-demand electrical energy and replaces the need for movable fossil-fuel-based power generators.
The target applications include power for construction sites, outdoor events, on-demand electric vehicle charging, and disaster relief. MoviGEN is non-polluting and much quieter than diesel generators. Other advantages include lower operating costs and less maintenance.
“MoviGEN is scalable on both power and energy (battery capacity) ratings. The systems can range from 5 kW/10 kWh to 200 kW/400 kWh. We also provide customised solutions for power and energy ratings beyond 200 kW/400 kWh based on the application,” AmpereHour Energy CEO Ayush Misra told pv magazine.  “The charging time would vary based on the system’s power rating.”
MoviGEN system comes with AmpereHour’s energy management platform, which facilitates remote management and control of MoviGEN via its Elina software platform. The software facilitates real-time monitoring of many system parameters, enabling future optimisation and safe operation.
