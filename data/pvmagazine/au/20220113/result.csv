Foresight acquired a 49% interest in the two solar farms in 2017 but earlier this week the renewable-energy investor announced it had purchased the remaining 51% stake in the facilities. Financial details about the deal were not revealed but the original transaction, which included 100% ownership of the 70 MW Oakey 2 Solar Farm, was valued at $64 million.
The Longreach Solar Farm, in Queensland’s central west, and the Oakey 1 solar plant in the Darling Downs region in the state’s southeast, are fully operational and Foresight said full ownership provides the company with total managerial control over future optimisation initiatives.
Foresight said both solar farms operate under power purchase agreements (PPAs) with the Queensland government for the sale of electricity and large-scale generation certificates (LGCs). These are under a contract-for-difference structure for a 20-year period from the date of commissioning and deliver “a highly contracted revenue level of operational cash flows”.
Both Longreach and Oakey 1 come with senior debt facilities, including from the Clean Energy Finance Corp (CEFC), that expire in April and are expected to be refinanced in the first quarter of this year.
“This acquisition further strengthens the company’s international portfolio, while the highly contracted revenue profile of the assets will increase the predictability of the company’s portfolio cash flow generation in the medium and long-term,” the company said in a statement.
The purchase boosts Foresight’s Australian solar PV portfolio to 227 MW across four sites. The company also owns the 110 MW Bannerton Solar Farm, near Robinvale in Victoria.
Foresight said the Australian assets form part of the company’s international growth strategy, complementing 735 MW of ground-mounted solar installed in the UK and another 125 MW installed in Spain.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/13/modelling-finds-building-with-wa-companys-solar-windows-nearly-eliminates-operational-emissions/,"RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,CANADA,UNITED STATES,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 13, 2022",Modelling finds building with WA company’s solar windows nearly eliminate operational emissions,"West Australian solar glass developer ClearVue Technologies has released the results of modelling it commissioned to demonstrate the energy and thermal improvements of integrating photovoltaic products into inner-city buildings. The findings are striking. 
Integrating concentrator photovoltaics (CPV) products like solar windows into high-rise structures massively reduces carbon emissions not only by generating clean electricity for the building, but through its thermal-insulative properties which significantly reduce the loads from heating and cooling.
“The Archetype demonstrates the potential effectiveness of ClearVue products to reduce the carbon emissions by over 90%,” ClearVue Technologies’ Executive Chairman, Victor Rosenberg, told pv magazine Australia. 
The ‘Archetype’ Rosenberg is referring to is the name given to the modelled building – a computer simulation and detailed thermal model of a six storey, 15,000 m² office building in Toronto, Canada. The modelling was delivered by Canadian company Footprint, with ClearVue noting that had the modelling been completed for a climate like Australia’s, performance may have even been better. 
ClearVue Technologies
Nonetheless, the modelled building was found to be in the top 1% of Canadian office buildings for energy performance, scoring 99 out of 100 points in the North American building Energy Star Rating System.
“By using the [solar] windows we can bring the building closer to the emissions standards that people are demanding or expecting,” Rosenberg said.
Solar windows are still a burgeoning technology, although they’ve figured in our collective imagination for decades. ClearVue commissioned the newly published modelling, in part, to help it quantify specifically how the technology will enable the ‘net zero’ buildings, perhaps even cities, of the future. This is obviously particularly important as new building standards are rolled out globally to improve sustainability. 
Currently, the construction of buildings and their operations account for well over a third of global CO2 emissions annually, with building operations responsible for the lions share at 28%.
One of the most compelling features of the Archetype building model, Rosenberg said, is that it was able to maintain a high level of glass to wall ratio. Historically windows are the weak link in a building’s thermal performance, so low carbon buildings tend to reduced window to hit energy use and carbon emission targets. 
Using Clearvue’s solar windows, which are highly insulative, the model achieved window to wall ratios of 90/70/70/40% on the respective elevations of the building, making more natural light available. Rosenberg noted this also makes ClearVue’s solar windows a promising proposition not only for new buildings, but to also to retrofit and decarbonise existing structures which tend to have more glass than wall.
ClearVue
“We’ve had quite a lot of enquiries from big builders property people and all they’re asking we can actually answer them because we’ve done all the prototyping,” Rosenberg said. “It’s given us a lot of information. There’s potential in Adelaide, we’re talking to the U.S., in fact even in places like Cambodia, Dubai.”
The modelling compared the building to standards in Canada, the U.S., Singapore, Australia and New Zealand – and found the Archetype model fell in the top tier of each.
The research mainly focussed however on Canada’s Toronto Green Standard Compliance, which the company describes as one of the world’s highest standards of building performance. The standard examines buildings’ Total Energy Use Intensity (TEUI), their Thermal Energy Demand Intensity (TEDI), as well as their Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity (GHGI).
According to 2030 requirements for the standard, a building’s energy use should be 64 KWh per square metre per year; thermal energy demand shouldn’t be more 15 KWh per square metre per year, and carbon emissions per square metre shouldn’t exceed 4 kg.
The Archetype building’s energy use was found to be 62.7 KWh per square metre per year;
thermal energy demand was 14.4 kWh per square metre per year, and its carbon emissions per square metre were 3.1 kg.
To give those numbers some context, the average operational energy consumption of buildings in North America is 228 KWh per square metre per year and their carbon emissions are 74.2 kg. In short, the decrease is colossal. 
Rosenberg told pv magazine Australia that ClearVue is also currently undergoing lifecycle assessments which would look at its products embodied energy (the embodied energy in construction materials account for around 11% of CO2 emissions globally). Rosenberg expects the results, which are called an Environmental Product Declaration, will be certified around March.
“That declaration carries a lot of weight,” he said. “It [Environmental Product Declarations] is now considered an essential tool heading to sustainability focus and customs… When I was in Germany, and this is going back a few years now, is about the carbon balance sheet.”

Scientists from the Oregon State University, in the United States, have proposed to improve the efficiency of compressed air energy storage (CAES) by recovering the thermochemical heat produced by facilities relying on the technology.
“Conventional CAES has relatively low cost compared to all kinds of batteries and we would imagine that this technology should only improve that advantage,” the research’s corresponding author, Nicholas AuYeung, told pv magazine. “Cost analysis has not been performed yet, but we are interested in doing a thorough techno-economic analysis.”
Described in the paper “Thermochemical heat recuperation for compressed air energy storage,” published in Energy Conversion and Management, the novel approach consists of applying a thermochemical energy storage (TCES) technique that stores energy in chemical bonds to recover the heat produced during air compression operations. “TCES systems based upon metal oxide redox reactions which can release oxygen under high partial pressures of oxygen are especially of interest, although any chemistry that can operate under high pressures could be considered,” the study reads. “These schemes typically take on the form of solid-gas reactions.”
The scientists proposed to use, in particular, resistance heating to decompose barium oxides in the charging step of CAES through three different strategies: Utilising direct heat transfer through a reactive bed of TCES materials in a solid-gas reaction; indirect heat transfer between hot air and the TCES system; and a combination of direct and indirect heat transfer.
“We looked at TCES with packed beds filled with rocks and barium oxides,” AuYeung stated. “Our results showed a similar round-trip efficiency between beds with TCES and beds without because of the relatively low heat capacity and heat of reaction for the barium oxides.”
According to him, the proposed system configuration can ensure a 60% round-trip efficiency with a 20-hour storage time after charge. This compares to a round-trip efficiency of only between 40% and 50% in conventional CAES. “To better illustrate the potential of the concept, we came up with a hypothetical material with the same heat capacity as rocks but a thermochemical storage capacity three times that of barium oxides, and we looked at that hypothetical material in our model,” AuYeung further explained. “Results showed that a potential round-trip efficiency improvement of more than 5% can be obtained, as well as longer storage duration. Also, 45% less filler volume would be needed to achieve storage capacity similar to rock-filled beds.”
Looking forward, the research team is planning to investigate more materials. “There are non-oxygen chemistries such as hydrates and carbonates that have the hypothetical properties – high heat capacity, high heat of reaction – we looked at, but right now we haven’t identified one for a redox material that operates on oxygen swing,” AuYeung concluded.

The Columboola Solar Farm, which boasts 417,000 PV modules, is situated between Chinchilla and Miles on a 1,009 acre site and is expected to generate approximately 440 GWh of clean energy annually, enough to power the equivalent of 100,000 households. 
Constructed by Sterling & Wilson, QLD government-owned electricity generation company CS Energy has agreed to purchase 100% of the solar farm’s renewable energy generation for the first 10 years of operation.
Powerlink chief executive Paul Simshauser said the grid connection activities, which involved building two kilometres of transmission line and completing works at the existing Columboola Substation, would help the renewable energy generated at the Columboola Solar Farm be delivered to the National Electricity Market (NEM). 
“After many months of dedicated on-ground work, our project team has been able to bring construction activities to a close – safely, on-time and on-budget,” said Simshauser. 
“The project was technically complex and required meticulous planning, with the new stretch of transmission line crossing directly under an existing 275kV line” continued Simshauser. “We will complete final testing and commissioning works in coming months as construction activities at the solar farm progress.”
CS Energy CEO Andrew Bills described the transmission works as a milestone, adding: “The Columboola Solar Farm is the largest renewable energy offtake in CS Energy’s portfolio and we are excited to see the project reach this stage. CS Energy continues to diversify our portfolio with these kinds of offtakes, which enable us to offer renewable energy to our customers and support Queensland’s 50% renewables target by 2030.”

Lightweight-solar pioneer Sunman Energy has opened a new, 1GW production facility in Yangzhong City, in the Jiangsu province of China. The innovative solar tech company, founded and chaired by “Sun King” Dr. Zhengrong Shi, has touted what it calls the world’s largest production facility for lightweight solar PV.
Sunman Energy specialises in lightweight crystalline modules which use polymer composite materials instead of glass. Whereas most conventional solar panels weigh at least 20kg/m2, Sunman’s eArche modules shave the weight off rooftop installations to around 5kg/m2.
The company’s latest product, the eArc SMF430F module, launched in October, is bigger than previous devices and weighs in at 11.2kg. Unlike glass modules, the eArc is akin to a flexible “solar skin” 70% lighter and up to 95% thinner than conventional products of the same wattage.
Sunman says its panels can be bonded directly to roofs, no matter their shape or curves, using structural-grade silicon, which also eliminates the risk of water penetration that can plague traditional solar mounting systems. The modules are based on standard half-cut monocrystalline PERC cells and are available in framed and non-framed versions.
Sunman founder and CEO Shi previously founded one-time giant Suntech, a company that revolutionised solar cell and module production, and acted as Suntech chairman and CEO until 2013. Before that, Shi had received a PhD in electrical engineering from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia, where he studied under scientia professor Martin Green – “the father of photovoltaics.”
Green prepared a video message of congratulations for the launch of Sunman’s 1GW factory. He looked back on the company’s projects in Australia he has been involved with, including Byron Bay’s solar train and a 235kW solar installation unveiled at the Australian National Maritime Museum’s heritage centre. Another showcase of Sunman technology in Australia is a 72.5kW curved-roof solar installation on the Noosaville Library in Queensland. “There is clearly a large market out there for this new product and I wish all those involved every success in the future,” Green said in the video message.
Shi told pv magazine in 2019 his company’s production capacity stood at 100MW. According to recent media reports, the 1GW factory will be commissioned in two phases, with the first already operational and the second due to come online mid-year. In addition to the production base, the facility will also incorporate R&D and testing centres and composite material production lines.

Distributed batteries “offer utilities an under-utilised, flexible resource,” says a report from the United States Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
Batteries that customers purchase for use during power outages, and batteries used to increase solar self-consumption, could both provide grid services at other times, the report says.
To capture the value of batteries, policymakers and utilities can “improve distributed battery storage economics” in a way that also reduces grid operating costs. That involves compensating customers so they are more likely to buy a battery and operate it in a way that provides grid services. Grid services from batteries will then reduce the need for utility-provided grid services, reducing costs for all customers.
Beyond batteries’ obvious ability to provide energy, batteries can also provide capacity, as well as grid services such as ramping support, frequency regulation, and voltage regulation, the authors note. Batteries can also reduce solar curtailment, and help defer transmission and distribution investments.
The report aims to guide decision-makers on the challenges of updating utility rate designs to “capture” the value of distributed batteries, and describes some approaches that states and utilities have taken so far.
The authors foresee greater adoption of distributed batteries as battery costs fall, and a greater ability for batteries to provide grid services with “advanced technology that enables a higher level of visibility, communication, and control.”
They point to three such technologies: smart inverters for batteries that are compliant with the IEEE 1547-2018 standard; virtual power plants that aggregate customer-sited batteries using automated controls and communication; and distributed energy resource management (DERM) systems operated by utilities.
The authors focus on the retail utility perspective. A distribution utility “typically has very little visibility of the real-time operation” of distributed resources, they say, adding that this can impair the utility’s ability to “ensure real-time reliable and safe operation of the distribution system.”
The report does not discuss sending real-time prices to smart batteries and other devices that can automatically respond to price signals. That approach was proven to work in a pilot study on a distribution circuit served by the California utility SCE, funded by the California Energy Commission. Even so, the LBL study projects that over time, “more dynamic, automated programs could become prevalent.”
In regions with a grid operator known as an ISO or RTO, grid services that batteries can provide may be priced through organised markets that “produce a transparent assessment of value,” the report says, but grid services “procured outside of organised markets must rely on avoided costs.”
The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory report is titled “Opportunities and Challenges to Capturing Distributed Battery Value via Retail Utility Rates and Programs.”

Dutch start-up Ocean Grazer grabbed the limelight at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2022) in Las Vegas last week, where its new design for an offshore energy storage system based on hydro dam technology garnered the “Best of Innovation” award.
The Ocean Battery is a pumped hydro system in a box. Buried in the seabed, the battery provides storage up to the gigawatt-hour scale by connecting rigid reservoir elements, each with a storage volume of 10MWh. The system can be adapted to various forms of renewable power generation such as floating PV, offshore wind, tidal and wave energy.
“There is a perfect match between the Ocean Battery and floating PV arrays,” Ocean Grazer CEO Frits Bliek told pv magazine. “As we can adapt the charging capacity independently from the discharging capacity, we can tune the capex [capital expenditure cost] to rapidly absorb the solar peak around noun and discharge the accumulated power of the rest of the day. In this way we can optimally tune into the business case of a floating PV array.”
The Ocean Battery features technology that has been in use at hydroelectric dams for more than a century. While it has identical functionality and performance, it comes with one big difference, as the hydrostatic pressure comes for free and there is no need to build an entire hydro dam.
In other words, the Ocean Battery stores energy by pumping water from low-pressure rigid reservoirs, each holding up to 20 million litres of freshwater, into high-pressure flexible bladders installed on the seabed. During discharging, water stored as potential energy flows back from the flexible bladder to the rigid reservoir via hydro turbines that generate electricity.
“Minimal discharging time is 0.5 hours, sufficient for the highest demands in the utility sector,” said Bliek. “Any lower power-capacity-to-storage-capacity can be created, to support bulk shifting, for example. There is no self-discharge whatsoever so power can be stored as long as you want.”
The round trip efficiency of the Ocean Battery stands at around 78%. Its technical lifetime is rated at a minimal 20 years but is most likely 30-50 years, according to its developer. Ocean Grazer said the battery has low maintenance costs and is designed with sustainability in mind, enhancing marine life. It is made from readily available global materials steel, concrete, and rubber/PVC and uses clean water as the energy carrier.
 
According to its product sheet, the Ocean Battery is able to provide a wide range of grid services including frequency control, black-start power, and energy arbitrage. In addition to the traditional services provided by utility scale storage – such as curtailment prevention and congestion management – Ocean Battery can also allow “over-planting,” to maximise the energy yield of wind farms per square kilometre, ie it can make room for more turbine capacity at the same project, improving its economics.
Developer Ocean Grazer was spun out of the University of Groningen, in the Netherlands. The start-up describes itself as “the only company that provides a reliable, affordable and eco-friendly energy storage system that provides a flexible and modular solution for offshore and inshore energy storage at [a] gigawatt-hour scale.”
Ocean Grazer is developing its first commercial demonstrator for an inshore lake in the north of the Netherlands which hosts a floating solar installation. That system is slated for completion in 2023. “Next to that we are developing an offshore project connected to a wind farm,” Bliek added. “Potentially, a floating solar installation could be included in that project but details [have to be] worked out as we are in the middle of the scoping phase. The project will be completed in 2025.”

Chemical-based battery company LG Energy Solution’s (LGES’) US$10.7 billion (AU$14.8 billion) initial public offering received bids worth around US$80 billion (AU$110 billion) from institutional investors, Reuters reported on Tuesday. The book for the offering, the largest ever held in South Korea, will close tomorrow with deal pricing set for Friday.
The reported IPO could take the company’s value to as much as KRW70.2 trillion (US$58.8 billion), which would make it South Korea’s third-biggest listed company, after Samsung Electronics and semiconductor business SK Hynix. According to a previous report from Bloomberg, the price range was set at KRW257,000-300,000 per share.
Demand for the stock was reportedly around 13 times bigger than the US$6 billion (AU$8.3 billion) on offer to institutions, according to the company’s regulatory filings for the IPO.
LGES had announced at a press conference this week it would use the proceeds from its IPO – on the Korea Composite Stock Price Index – to expand its manufacturing capacity in Europe, the Americas and Asia. The company also forecast its market share would overtake that of rival Chinese battery maker CATL thanks to a wider range of customers, and said it was aiming for a double-digit operating margin.
