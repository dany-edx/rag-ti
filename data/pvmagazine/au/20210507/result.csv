https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/07/australian-manufacturer-unveils-new-400w-module-as-demand-grows/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 7, 2021",Australian manufacturer unveils new 400W module as demand grows,"Tindo Solar has unveiled its new Karra 400P Mono PERC module as it looks to satisfy booming demand in the domestic market while the new-generation module is also being exported to Vietnam after that sales pipeline had delivered 10,000 modules in an 18-month period before it was interrupted by restrictions associated with the Covid-19 pandemic.
Tindo Solar CEO Shayne Jaenisch said the disruptions triggered by Covid had presented some challenges but it had also provided the company with an opportunity to grow as consumers became more demanding.
“What generally happens with PV is the retailer dictates what gets sold but when Covid hit, consumers began dictating to the retailer: ‘I want quality solar and it has to be Australian made’,” Jaenisch told pv magazine.
“At the start of 2020 we were 90% reliant on direct sales through our own retail arm. Covid hit in March and we had a 70% increase in our wholesale orders.
“That’s when the industry changed for us. Our inquiries went from about 60 wholesale client pre-Covid and now we’ve got nearly 1,000.”
The new 400 W module, which replaces the 380 W model in the Karra series, is already among Tindo’s most popular modules.
It is manufactured with 72 full square monocrystalline G1 cells and utilises 5 Busbar technology. It measures 2000 x 1005 x 40mm and weighs in at 22kg with a maximum efficiency of up to 20.1%. The open-circuit voltage is 49.32 V and 41.3 V and the short-circuit current is 10.42 A.

Tindo has updated its traditional MC4 connectors on the module to MC4-EVO 2 Staubli connectors, increasing the maximum system voltage for the module to 1,500 V, which the company said makes it ideal for both commercial and residential applications.
The module can be used in operating temperatures of between -40 degrees Celsius and 85 degrees Celsius and the operating temperature coefficient is -0.37% per degree Celsius.
The Karra range also includes 60 and 66-cell versions with power ratings of 330 and 365 W respectively and an efficiency rating of 19.8%.
The module features 3.2mm coat tempered glass wrapped in a black anodized aluminium frame. The module comes with a 12-year product guarantee and is said to be able to operate at 80% of its original performance after 25 years.
“Our panels are mounted and performing everyday at the Desert Knowledge Testing Centre in Alice Springs. The Karra series panels are consistently one of the highest performing panels at the centre,” the company said in the data sheet.
Jaenisch said Tindo’s fleet failure rate is some 200 times lower than its competitors and if the module is purchased direct or through a reseller the module is supported by a 25-year product and replacement warranty.
“Only the best products in the market are carrying a 25-year replacement warranty and we are one of them,” he said.

Jaenisch said the growing demand for the Australian-made modules has forced the company to double its manufacturing output at its existing 60 MW capacity production line in Adelaide’s northern suburbs.
“Previously, we could pretty well manufacture enough in an eight-hour shift to satisfy our export market to Vietnam, our retail market and the wholesale clients that we had but when Covid hit, we had to go to two shifts just to keep up with that extra wholesale demand,” he said.
That issue is set to be resolved later this year with $10 million invested to boost capacity at the Mawson Lakes plant to 150 MW per annum.
A new factory building has been completed and the production equipment is set to be installed by August.
The shift will also see Tindo transition to the latest M10 cell technology with Jaenisch revealing a 550 W 144-cell and a 400 W 120-cell split cell module are on the horizon.
“The future is looking really, really good for us,” he said.
“One of the reasons we have flown under the radar a bit is, if our orders grew any faster, our current line wouldn’t be able to keep up with it, but the new line is 150 MW which allows us to be a little bit more serous with our wholesale market. It’s come at a really good time for us.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/07/energy-is-neither-created-nor-destroyed-it-just-transitions/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,NEW SOUTH WALES",,"MAY 7, 2021",Energy is neither created nor destroyed; it just transitions,"From Lumi Adisa at Cornwall Insight Australia
In April, the NSW government opened consultations on “specific urgent and mechanical policy details” on regulations needed to implement its Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap released late last year. The Roadmap aims to unlock 12GW of new renewable energy capacity from selected Renewable Energy Zones (REZs) with an additional 2GW in storage by 2030.
In our Chart of the Week Issue 39 last June which highlighted the looming energy gap between retiring coal generators and growth of renewables, we predicted that the announcement of the Central West Orana (CWO) REZ was the first of many to come. A year on, that prediction has come true with the announcement of the Roadmap aiming to unlock even more REZs last November. In this Chart of the Week, we take stock of how this energy gap has evolved since last year, and we provide commentary on the likely impact the Roadmap will have on the market going forward.
As shown in Figure 1, the contribution to the NSW generation mix from variable renewable energy (VRE) sources (wind and solar) have grown significantly in just a year (Q1 2020 to Q1 2021). In fact, Q1 2021 saw the largest year-on-year growth (5%) of VRE contribution to the state’s generation mix in the last 4 years. Not surprisingly, this same period also saw the lowest contribution from coal generators exiting the market in the next 10-15 years, dipping for the first time below 70% (~67%) of NSW’s local energy requirements. These trends suggest that the market transition is gathering pace in NSW with the growth gradient of VRE contribution to generation mix in the state looking strong.
Nonetheless, going forward, NSW as a state looks quite attractive for renewable investments given ~67% of the current generation sent-out from the state would have to come from somewhere else in the next 10-15 years. With VRE only currently making up ~15% of the generation mix in the state, significant new capacity (in addition to improved import capacity via new interconnectors) would have to connect in the next decade to replace the energy sent-out from these coal-fired power stations earmarked for retirement.
The key questions to then ask are: will the current retirement timelines hold true given the incoming Roadmap? And if they don’t, is the energy from these REZs sufficient as replacement to ensure reliability in the state? Simply put, were the Roadmap to go ahead in its current form, it is fair to expect that these coal units would exit the market earlier than expected, perhaps even in a disorderly manner? The answer to the second question however is slightly more complex given the weather dependency of VRE, the merchant outlook under the Roadmap, and the associated question of storage.
In Issue 78, we looked at the correlation of wind output across all REZs in the NEM. The identified REZs in the Roadmap exhibit varying degrees of wind correlation; CWO and New England showing the highest correlation factor (0.53) and New England and South West the lowest (0.32). This suggests wind projects under the Roadmap are more likely than not to contribute positively to reliability in the state. Exactly how this plays out – especially during extended VRE droughts – is of course left to be seen with storage (or new hydrogen/gas plants) likely to significantly influence this reliability outlook.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/07/agl-pushes-ahead-with-renewable-energy-plans-for-liddell-site/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,PUMPED HYDRO,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 7, 2021",AGL pushes ahead with renewable energy plans for Liddell site,"Energy giant AGL has confirmed the appointment of Melbourne-based diversified engineering contractor Delta Group to oversee the first stage of closure, decommissioning and demolition of the coal-fired Liddell Power Station in the New South Wales Hunter Valley.
The 1,680 MW power station will close in April 2023 with AGL reconfirming its intentions to repurpose the existing infrastructure at the site to support the construction of new generation and storage infrastructure.
AGL has already lodged plans to establish a giant 500 MW battery at the site as the gen-tailer manages its transition to a renewable energy dominated electricity market.
AGL chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said the appointment of Delta Group was an important milestone as the company prepares for Liddell’s retirement.
“For the next three months, AGL and Delta will establish appropriate documentation, processes and systems to ensure an orderly and safe closure of the station’s units,” Brokhof said.
“Delta will help identify specific risks and controls for decommissioning, asset salvage, remediation and demolition.”
The first stage of these works will conclude in mid-July 2021.
The first unit at Liddell will close in April 2022. The remaining three units will close in April 2023.

Brokhof said preparing for Liddell’s closure was significant with the power station having produced about 8000 GWh of electricity annually since it was first commissioned in 1971.
“Preparing for Liddell’s closure is a bittersweet moment for AGL … but equally we’re excited to take these steps as we transition and enter a new era for the business,” he said.
“The station is now nearing the end of its technical life and our transition program is about ensuring the safety of our people and preparing other sources of generation to continue delivering reliable electricity.”
AGL, which in March announced it would split its business into two entities with separate strategies, had originally floated plans to transform the Liddell site into a renewable energy hub producing electricity from gas, solar PV backed up by battery storage and pumped hydro storage.
In recent months the company has confirmed it is seeking planning approval from the NSW government for a big battery of up to 500 MW. The first phase of the project involves the installation of 150 MW of battery storage within 18-24 months. Work on Phase 1 is expected to be complete by the time the coal-fired plant shuts down
“Australia’s future energy needs will be delivered through a combination of technologies – gas, hydrogen, pumped-hydro, renewables and firming technologies and industrial developments,” Brokhof said.
“We are continuing to work on a number of plans for the Liddell site as we develop an energy hub which includes solar storage systems, grid-scale batteries and a waste-to-energy facility.
“We are looking forward to progressing these plans which will provide essential jobs and economic activity to the region while also supporting Australia’s energy transition and AGL’s Climate Statement commitments which include net-zero emissions by 2050.”

The Liddell battery forms part of AGL’s plans to add 850 MW of grid-scale batteries to its portfolio by 2024
Earlier this year, AGL announced construction had started on its 250 MW one-hour-duration battery at the site of its Torrens Island power station in South Australia.
Also this year it lodged a planning application to construct a 200 MW grid-scale battery at its Loy Yang power station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley. It has plans to build a 50 MW battery at Broken Hill in NSW and has announced support for battery projects at Wandoan (100 MW) in Queensland and Maoneng (4 x 50 MW) in NSW. It is already operating the 30 MW/ 8 MWh BESS at Dalrymple in South Australia.
“It is through low emission firming technology, like batteries, that we are continuing to drive AGL’s energy transition and respond to the accelerating market forces of customer demand, community expectation and the development of technology,” Brokhof said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/07/taylor-announces-30-million-funding-for-territory-infrastructure-initiatives/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 7, 2021",Taylor announces $30 million funding for Territory infrastructure initiatives,"The Federal Government has revealed as part of its 2021-22 budget it will plough $30 million into electricity infrastructure projects in the Northern Territory, including $15 million to help build a 35 MW battery energy storage system (BESS) to support the Darwin-to-Katherine grid as more Territorians install solar on their roofs.
The funding announcement also includes $15 million to advance the deployment of renewable energy microgrids in remote Indigenous communities.
The funding boost will build on the Territory Government ‘s own commitments which include $30 million for battery energy storage systems and $69 million to advance the installation of microgrids in remote and regional areas.
The Darwin Big Battery project was first announced in April 2020 with the Territory Government confident the $30 million 35 MW system will help deliver security and reliability with growing levels of variable renewable energy entering the grid.
It is expected the BESS will enable further penetration of solar PV on the network, reduce the reliance on gas-fired generators, shore up system strength and contribute to system inertia.
Government-owned Territory Generation, the major producer of electricity in the Northern Territory, will operate the BESS which is expected to save about $6 million a year by supplying power system services currently provided by gas generators.
Early indications were the battery would be operational in the second half of 2022.
The Darwin Big Battery is among a swag of battery storage systems being rolled out across the Territory with Sun Cable planning to build a mega battery of up to 100 MW in Darwin as part of its proposed 10 GW Australia-ASEAN power link project.
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) is backing the Alice Springs Future Grid project, announced last year, which includes a grid-scale battery system and aggregation of residential batteries into a virtual power plant, while a 5 MW BESS was successfully integrated into Alice Springs’ grid in 2018.

Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said the funding for the battery and the microgrid projects will help deliver secure and reliable power in the NT, while reducing emissions.
“These projects will provide reliable and secure power for Territorians and deliver affordable energy solutions for remote indigenous communities,” he said.
“We are focused on working with states and territories to ensure their specific energy needs are met and will continue to work closely with our counterparts to ensure all Australians can access the cheap and reliable power, wherever they live.”
Taylor said the latest funding announcement builds on the $50 million Regional and Remote Communities Reliability Fund, which has already awarded over $5.2 million to microgrid feasibility studies across more than 20 locations in the NT.
The Federal Government commitment comes just days after the Territory Government announced it would continue to pursue the rollout of renewable energy solutions in remote communities, building on the $6.6 million Renewable Remote Power Program and the $59 million Solar Energy Transformation Program which have already delivered 10 MW of solar generation to remote communities in the Territory.
Renewables, including solar PV systems, batteries and green hydrogen are set to replace diesel generators in 72 remote communities.
The Territory Government said it will spend $2 million over the next two years securing land access near communities, assessing future power demand, and surveying transmission lines and other infrastructure already on-site.

It was a outcry that represented QLD’s idiosyncratic identity, and there has been no shortage of outcry against the Australian Energy Market Commission’s (AEMC) draft determination, released in March, which revived its proposal for what is effectively a solar tax. And it might just be QLD that stands up to it.
According to the Brisbane Times, QLD “looks likely to oppose a move to charge solar users a fee when they sell excess electricity to the grid.” This came after an indication from QLD Energy Minister Mick de Brenni that he did not support the rule change. De Brenni asked for submissions to his department last month from energy users with their opinions on the proposed change, and it seems energy users are not happy with the prospect.
“The AEMC is consulting on a draft rule change proposed by a private electricity company in South Australia,” de Brenni told the Brisbane Times. “There is no doubt that intermittent renewables like solar are putting pressure on the network and stability needs to be addressed across the National Electricity Market.”
“My department is preparing a response to the proposal” de Brenni continued, “and I expect it will indicate that system-wide measures, especially investment in more storage, will encourage more solar and are preferable to the proposed rule change.”
Solar energy lobbyists Solar Citizens welcomed de Brenni’s position. “We congratulate the Queensland Government for joining Victoria in pushing back against this harmful proposal,” said Ellen Roberts, Solar Citizens’ national director.
“The same state governments that have empowered households to make the solar switch are the ones that have the power to stop solar owners from being unfairly penalised now,” Roberts continued, making the point that feed-in tariffs are already dropping and a tax on top would be a “double whammy for millions of Australia’s solar owners.”
Roberts advised against rushing through a rule change that will only “slug” solar households rather than continue to incentivise them.
Of course, unlike the 1995 State of Origin Series, New South Wales is winning the solar uptake race, overtaking QLD back in 2017. Nevertheless, according to the Australian Energy Council QLD has maintained a strong second place amongst the states and territories (excepting solar+battery uptake in which QLD lags). The Clean Energy Regulator reports that QLD had, up to March 2021, installed 778,579 solar systems.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/07/australian-solar-also-rises-new-aec-report-shows-australians-going-big-on-pv/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"MAY 7, 2021","Australian solar also rises, new AEC report shows Australians going big on PV","As few would disagree, the talk of the solar industry at the moment is the larger formate modules and many are asking whether bigger is necessarily better. However, there is one thing that is getting bigger in Australian solar that few would complain about, and that is the size of small-scale systems themselves. 
According to the Australian Energy Council’s (AEC) quarterly Solar Report, the average solar system size installed for residential and small businesses has increased from 2.65 kW in January 2012 to a peak of 8.86 kW in December 2020. Of course, it is worth noting that the average size of system installations peaks every December followed by a seasonal fall in January.

Of course, similar increases of scale are being seen in the large-scale sector, increasing 5.4 GW across 69 solar farm projects in that time. In the first quarter of 2021 alone the Report shows 450 MW of newly grid-connected solar capacity. This includes the 132 MW Glenrowan West Sun Farm in Victoria (VIC) which went live in February, the 200 MW Kiamal Solar Farm, the 106 MW Yatpool Solar Farm which waited a full 18-months since completion of construction to connect in northwest VIC in April, and the 12.5 MW Robertson Barracks Solar Farm in the Northern Territory. 

AEC chief executive, Sarah McNamara, said the quarterly Report also shows that the “number of new monthly installations are likely to exceed 85,000 for the January to March 2021 quarter. New South Wales (NSW) continues to lead the states with more than 24,400 new installations and 194 MW of total installed solar capacity added in the first quarter of 2021.”
McNamara also noted the growing uptake of battery storage, “with almost 1,400 units installed in 2021 so far. When comparing the uptake of battery installations with rooftop solar by state South Australia (SA) and NSW lead, accounting for around 25% and 23% of total installations.”  
Interestingly, Queensland (QLD), the Sunshine State, seems to be the state lagging behind in the solar+battery installation figures, only accounting for 11.8% of total solar+battery installations. This may be due to the QLD Government’s incentive scheme drying up in 2019, showing the necessity of subsidies when it comes to batteries which are still on the expensive side. 

A nation of exporters 
The AEC has also done some number crunching on what is probably the biggest talking point in Australian solar so far as end-users are concerned – export charges. 
As SA has shown, unless grid upgrades are made by electricity distributors, solar exports will be limited and this will have a resounding impact on the solar industry, on wholesale energy prices, and of course, most importantly, on emissions reduction. 
As the AEMC has outlined, there are two paths forward, either we do nothing, and watch electricity prices and emissions rise. Or we upgrade the distribution network and incur extra costs in the meantime, costs which can be offset with solar.

Taiwanese solar cell and module maker United Renewable Energy Corp (URE) has announced it has won a tender held by state-owned utility Taiwan Power Company for the deployment of a 15 MW/15 MWh storage facility which, when built, will become Taiwan’s largest storage project for a single site.
The project will be implemented in partnership with Taiwan-based power electronics specialist Shihlin Electric and Engineering Corporation, French battery manufacturer Saft, and Underwriters Laboratories, a U.S., nonprofit, standards development organisation.
The storage system will be coupled to an operational 150 MW solar plant owned by Taiwan Power Company that was energised in early April and is located at a former salt mine in the south of the country. The solar park is the largest PV facility ever built in the island to date.
The battery will be provided by Saft and will help stabilise the local grid and provide ancillary services.
Developers of huge solar parks in Taiwan must continue to deal with resistance from the government, other industrial players, and the farming sector. As in neighbouring South Korea, land shortages are a big issue for solar deployment in Taiwan, as roughly two-thirds of the country is mountainous.
The Taiwanese government aims to install 20 GW of solar by 2025, with 3 GW of rooftop PV and 17 GW of ground-mounted capacity. According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency, the island had around 5.8 GW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2020.

The United States is the most attractive market for renewable energy investment, according to a new ranking by IHS Markit.
The Global Renewables Markets Attractiveness Rankings tracks attractiveness for investment in offshore wind, onshore wind and PV. It placed the United States in the No. 1 spot for 2020, citing the country’s sound market fundamentals and the availability of an attractive support scheme.
The ranking evaluated each country on the basis of current policy framework, market fundamentals, investor friendliness, infrastructure readiness, revenue risks, return expectations, and overall opportunity. Each market was assessed in individual categories for solar PV, onshore wind, offshore wind and an overall renewables score.

The overall country rankings were based on a combined score for offshore wind, onshore wind, and solar PV that weighted the technologies based on their expected levels of installations over the next decade.
Mainland China, which accounted for more than half of the world’s total non-hydro renewables additions last year, ranked third on the attractiveness ranking, weighed down by difficulties in accessing the market. Germany finished second, while France and Spain secured the fourth and fifth spots, respectively, based on strong market fundamentals backed by stable procurement mechanisms and long-term clean energy targets. Similar factors boosted Japan to eighth place and the Netherlands to ninth.
Countries with a strong impetus toward offshore wind got a significant boost, as IHS said the generation source is expected to be the fastest growing renewable energy technology in the next decade.
Strong ambitions and stable procurement initiatives in India, as well as the availability of attractive subsidies and a high degree of investor friendliness in Australia, drove these markets to the sixth and seventh spots on the list.
The United States also retained the top ranking in individual technology rankings for investment attractiveness for solar PV and onshore wind. The United Kingdom failed to crack the top 10 in the combined rankings due to its relative lack of support for developing onshore wind and PV. It ranked individually as the most attractive market for offshore wind investment.

Florida-based e-mobility company Evlomo Inc and Japanese-Thai business park operator Rojana Industrial Park Public Co Ltd have announced plans to invest “up to $1.06 billion” (AU$1.3b) into a joint venture to establish the gigagfab, with Rojana – itself a JV – set to invest in a 55% stake.
A press release issued by Evolomo about the plans, said groundbreaking on the first stage of the factory, in Nong Yai in the province of Chonburi, is expected to take place this year, with first-phase construction slated to require 18-24 months. That leaves open the slender possibility of production starting next year, although production lines are more likely to fire up in 2023.
Evlomo said the fab would produce batteries for two and four-wheeled vehicles, including buses and “heavy vehicles”, and would also manufacture, unspecified “energy storage solutions.”
The U.S.-based e-mobility business said the gigafactory, to be sited in the Eastern Economic Corridor special economic zone which spans three provinces in eastern Thailand, would create more than 3,000 jobs.
“The investment will play the role of vitalising the EV [electric vehicle] industry in Thailand,” said Kanit Sangsubhan, secretary-general from the eastern economic corridor office. “We look forward to Thailand becoming a global hub for [the] R&D, manufacturing and adoption of advanced energy storage and EV technologies in [the] entire South East Asia [region].“
