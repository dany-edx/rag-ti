The expansion project, due to be completed in 2025, will comprise a 24 MW solar farm, four 6 MW wind turbines and a 14 MW battery energy storage system. The hybrid renewables system, to be delivered under a 10-year build-own-operate agreement, will be coupled with Pacific Energy’s existing 52 MW gas-powered system at the mine site.
An intelligent control system, which has been developed in-house by Pacific Energy, has been designed to optimise input from the renewable energy and storage technologies and allow the system to run on 100% renewables for extended periods of time, helping to support AngloGold’s strategy to reduce its global carbon emissions from energy use by 30% by 2030.
Pacific Energy Chief Executive Officer Jamie Cullen said the integration of renewables into the existing power system would help the miner “decarbonise their operations without losing power reliability or efficiency.”
“This is an excellent outcome,” he said. “We expect our new system to reduce the mine site’s overall power generation emissions by 50%. It’s a really exciting prospect for us and AngloGold Ashanti, and one we’ve worked hard to achieve.”
The integration of renewables is expected to reduce Tropicana’s diesel and gas consumption for power generation by 96% and 50% respectively, slashing carbon emissions by an average of 65,000 tonnes per annum over the life of the agreement.
Delivery of the project will be coordinated by Pacific Energy’s Remote Energy and Integrated Renewables divisions with the battery energy storage system, high-voltage switch room and PV ring main units to be manufactured in house at its WA-based facilities.
Pacific Energy is expected to begin site works next month, with the project due for completion in early 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/26/agig-gives-green-light-for-10-mw-renewable-hydrogen-project/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 26, 2023",AGIG gives green light for 10 MW renewable hydrogen project,"Australian Gas Infrastructure Group (AGIG) said it will soon commence construction of its Hydrogen Park Murray Valley green hydrogen development which will include a 10 MW electrolyser that is expected to have an output capacity of about 4.5 tonnes of hydrogen per day.
The facility, to be powered by renewable energy sourced from a Victorian wind farm, will produce green hydrogen that will be blended at volumes of up to 10% into the existing gas network to supply about 40,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in the twin cities of Wodonga and Albury, on the New South Wales side of the border.
Expected to commence operations in mid-2025, the project is supported by $36.1 million grant funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and $12.31 million from the Victorian government, with additional financial backing from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC).
The Hydrogen Park Murray Valley facility will be home to the largest electrolyser on the east coast of Australia and the second 10 MW electrolyser to be deployed in the country with French developer Engie Renewables having already commenced construction of a 10 MW electrolyser project in Western Australia.
ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said the Murray Valley project will play a significant role in the development of commercial-scale renewable hydrogen deployments in Australia, helping to inform the progress of projects from conceptual plans to industrial implementation.
“Producing renewable hydrogen on this scale has never been done in Australia,” he said. “It’s essential to scaling up Australia’s renewable hydrogen industry that we get these first-generation projects up and running.”
“The lessons we learn here will help inform our hydrogen industry as it grows from its early stages to a pillar of the net-zero economy.”

AGIG will construct, commission and operate the Hydrogen Park Murray Valley facility that will have eight times the capacity of the group’s existing Hydrogen Park South Australia plant which is home to the largest operational electrolyser in Australia.
AGIG Chief Executive Officer Craig de Laine said the Murray Valley project represents a key step forward in Australia’s energy transition with green hydrogen capable of reducing emissions across the economy while underpinning the development of a domestic and export industry.
“Renewable hydrogen has substantial potential to support Australia’s low-carbon objectives,” he said. “We strongly believe that hydrogen, and renewable gas more broadly, will be critical if we are to achieve our ambitious low-carbon targets.”
While initial output from the facility will be blended into the existing gas supply, AGIG said Wodonga’s strategic location along a major road freight route also provides access to broader opportunities for decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors, particularly in heavy vehicle transport.
To be built alongside North East Water’s local wastewater treatment plant, the project will also explore opportunities to supply oxygen to aerate treatment ponds, and the potential to use reclaimed water for the production of hydrogen.
Construction of the Hydrogen Park Murray Valley facility is due to commence later this year with the facility operational by mid-2025.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/26/dont-want-to-sleepwalk-potential-cyberattack-surfaces-open-with-der-devices/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,LEGAL,POLICY,QUALITY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 26, 2023",‘Don’t want to sleepwalk’: potential cyberattack surfaces open with DER devices,"Attacks on energy infrastructure in Ukraine and rising geopolitical tensions have brought energy security to the fore internationally. Meanwhile, the digitalisation of our lives and energy systems is shifting the foundations of what it means to be ‘secure.’
Since centralised energy infrastructure has been the main target of attacks to date, this segment has received the most attention around questions of security. Few of the cybersecurity frameworks that Australia has in place today extend to technologies like rooftop solar and other distributed energy resources. “With any emerging technology and its widespread adoption, fast paced innovation cycles create cybersecurity risks,” Professor Helge Janicke, Research Director at Australia’s Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre told pv magazine Australia.
For the first time, households are generating and managing energy, using technologies that are marketed and made to be affordable to them – technologies which involve copious hardware and software components from different manufacturers, mostly foreign-owned, and have far looser grid connection standards than their large-scale counterparts.
“Centralised infrastructure is probably… going to have a system that is a lot more robust than an unregulated, commercially-interested company that is doing what they can to break into a market,” Grace Young, Chief Innovation Officer of clean-tech device company Wattwatchers told pv magazine Australia. “While that centralised infrastructure might immediately seem like honey pot, it quite potentially is much easier for somebody to get wide-scale control via a rouge piece of DER hardware or software.”
This isn’t cause for panic, but requires consideration. “We don’t want to sleep walk into something here,” Sunwiz founder and managing director, Wawrick Johnston told pv magazine Australia.

Before we go into particularities DER technologies, it’s worth doing a brief overview of what’s been happening in the nation’s energy cybersecurity space.
In December 2022, Australia’s Minister for Cyber Security, Clare O’Neil, announced the development of the 2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy. An expert advisory board will help develop the strategy, with the government only closing public submissions in April.
This is not the Commonwealth’s first foray into addressing the issues that come with moving the national energy system from thermal generation to inverter-based technologies. In 2018, Australia introduced the Security of Critical Infrastructure, or SoCI, Act. The legislation imposes cybersecurity obligations on critical infrastructure owners, including electricity, gas, and liquid fuel asset owners as well as energy market operators. To be subject to the policy, generators must have an installed capacity of at least 30 MW and be connected to the national energy market.

While these standards don’t capture DER technologies at the moment, Professor Janicke says there is a significant national effort looking at the security of Distributed and Consumer Energy Resources (CER). The Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre (CSCRC), he noted, is funding a test laboratory where systemic risks are explored.
“The CSCRC is also leading a national working group on cybersecurity bringing together key stakeholders in Australia’s energy ecosystem, contributing to other national initiatives around CER security,” Professor Janicke said.
There are also international efforts to tackle this issue, with Smart Energy Council CEO, John Grimes, pointing to revisions of the ‘IEEE 1547.3 Guide for Cybersecurity of DERs Interconnected With Electric Power Systems’ being led by US agency NREL. “Manufacturers around the world are also heavily involved in the establishment of global cybersecurity standards for DER & other renewables,” Grimes told pv magazine Australia.
Emerging standards on Internet of Things (IoT) device security and the European Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) will benefit Australia too, Professor Janicke noted.
Finally, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has been collaborating with industry and government to develop a tailored cybersecurity framework for Australia’s energy sector, known as the Australian Energy Sector Cyber Security Framework (AESCSF).
While it seems this voluntary program has so far focussed more on larger-players in the energy market, the 2023 program points to a focus on “less cyber mature energy organisations,” which AEMO notes “are unlikely to be captured by the SoCI Act but play an increasingly important role in maintaining energy security.” AEMO’s AESCSF team did not respond to requests for comment, but this sentiment would appear to signal towards heightened attention on the DER space.
All this is to say, risks are not being disregarded. Since the work being done around cybersecurity is largely ongoing, it is difficult to say exactly where the parameters for any upcoming standards will fall though. 
There are at least three distinct fields of risk which experts have flagged, all of which receive quite different amounts of scrutiny.
Those are the communication channels DER devices use, their internal security programming, and the device’s supply chain.
While DER systems include various technologies, inverters are a key focus because they are the point where the home and national grid connect. The role of inverters is also shifting as the penetration of DER grows, with the devices increasingly being used for control. From next month, July, the inverters of new solar systems in South Australia will be required to have software capable of “dynamic exports” – that is, the inverters will receive instructions based on network conditions and will adjust system output accordingly. More on the implications of this increasingly popular program in part two, but suffice to say inverters are key.
To date, many of the discussions around cybersecurity in the DER space have raised or alluded to popular Chinese equipment manufacturer Huawei, with the company’s ties to the Chinese government frequently noted. This is a touchy subject, and hard to disentangle from broader anti-Chinese sentiment which politicians often play on. 
Whether or not a single company being the focus of so much attention is warranted, equipment origination certainly mounts security questions. In a report on the cybersecurity findings from DER marketplace demonstration Project EDGE, AEMO noted: “Each entity across the DER Marketplace would have their own supply chains based on their business requirements. Such supply chains provide a threat actor with opportunities to perform malicious activities targeting a specific DER Marketplace entity. For example, a misconfigured device, or backdoor enabled software application.”
AEMO notes such risks could be mitigated by introducing cybersecurity requirements for key suppliers “according to industry better practices” and says “information sources should be monitored.” It adds these key suppliers should have appropriate Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) processes, which would enhance the visibility of risks and control.
Of the three risk fields, this is probably the most conceptual in that it exists today mostly as a hypothesis. However, as Professor Janicke notes, the threat posed by supply chains is a crucial consideration as it could give rise to “systematic” issues.
Unlike large-scale projects, most DER devices depend on household wi-fi, public internet connections or are monitored through cloud services on your mobile phone.
“Those communication channels are not secure and there’s a lot of potential along the way for things to be intercepted,” Wattwatcher’s Grace Young said. “That can then present therefore a flow on security risk down the path because if a slack [device] developer accidentally exposes secrets within a communication within an insecure channel that can open up the broader infrastructure to issues,” she added.

By secrets, Young is referring to passwords, API keys, etc. Interestingly, just this week the US’ Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) flagged a version of Enphase’s Envoy communication gateway as having this issue. “Enphase Envoy versions D7.0.88 and prior are vulnerable to a command injection exploit that may allow an attacker to execute root commands,” CISA announced, with Solarquotes reporting the device’s software was discovered to have “hardcoded credentials” – that is, user name and password are written into the software.
Young noted that if communication channels aren’t secure or expose secrets, it increases the “attack surface,” meaning how big potential entry points into the system are.
“My understanding of the standards that are currently under development, and notably the international 2030.5 and its ‘Australianised’ version known as CSIP-AUS [Common Smart Inverter Profile Australia], is that they aren’t intended to look at the security of the underlying infrastructure. They are really just standards on the interoperability of these systems to respond to system commands,” Young said.
“There’s kind of an underlying assumption that these devices are communicating securely…and that assumption may not return true,” she added.
Again, in its Project EDGE report, AEMO noted DER devices’ reliance on public communication channels concerning.
Another key, undiscussed consideration is the actual security of end devices.
The level of cybersecurity designed into devices is largely left to manufacturers. Some companies, including Wattwatchers, take cybersecurity very seriously, but it is understood the level of readiness within industry devices is fairly varied.
“If you’re not really focussed on it, there’s a lot more area where things can go wrong,” Young said. Programming watertight systems or, as it is often referred to, ‘security by design’ is obviously a far more onerous undertaking, and companies may simply be more focussed on their path to market especially in those early stages.
‘Proof of concept’ programs get used in production “way more that anyone wants to admit,” Young noted. Device developers may take shortcuts when writing these programs because they are intended only for demonstration. “Then suddenly you’ve got a compromised device in the field and then suddenly you’ve got a compromised device in the whole system,” Young said – again creating hackable openings.
In the Project EDGE report, AEMO deems vulnerabilities in DER marketplace software, firmware, third-party applications, as a ‘critical’ threat. “Given the nature of the distributed environment, weaknesses in the software/applications could have serious implications which could affect the DER marketplace as a whole,” the report noted.
“These are the sorts of challenges I think we need to be considering, especially when we are talking about control devices,” Young said.
In part two, pv magazine Australia looks at the potential consequences should vulnerabilities be weaponised.

The world’s largest miner plans to reduce its operational emissions by 30% by the end of the decade, based on 2020 levels, and achieve net zero by 2050.
BHP’s Minerals Australia vice president of planning and technical Anna Wiley said for the group’s Pilbara operations, which are not connected to an electricity grid, that means finding alternatives to gas for power generation and replacing diesel for trucks and trains.
Power for BHP’s Pilbara operations is currently supplied by its 190 MW Yarnima gas-fired power station and the company uses about 1,500 mega litres of diesel each year in more than 1,000 pieces of equipment.
“One of the things we do know for certain about the transformation is that we are going to need a lot more power,” Wiley said, adding that power demand is expected to increase by three to four times as the group moves to reduce emissions from fossil fuels.
“Over the decade we will increase the volume of renewables and anticipate having up to 200 MW each of wind and solar and 150 MW of battery energy storage installed capacity by 2030.”
Wiley said the miner is yet to determine if it will build the renewables itself or enter into offtake agreements with other developers.
“We are open to all options, and we are engaging with the market to determine the best solution for BHP,” she said.
Wiley said BHP has already made good progress towards its decarbonisation goals through leveraging power purchasing agreements which have supported more than 1.2 GW of new wind and solar generation and battery storage assets around Australia.
“These agreements have us on our way to reducing emissions by at least 50% by 2025, and our aim is to eliminate them entirely by 2030,” she said.
The company is also exploring options for interconnection to the electricity grid in the future, Wiley said.
Much of the expected increase in BHP’s power demand is set to come from the transformation of the diesel fleet with the miner nominating electrification rather than hydrogen as its preferred pathway.
“Our view is that an electrified mining fleet is more economic and more achievable than the alternative fuel sources,” Wiley said, adding that one of the reasons for this is energy efficiency with the electrified pathway expected to deliver about an 80% overall efficiency, compared with less than half of this for hydrogen.

pv magazine: Trina Solar was a latecomer in the n-type TOPCon solar module business, at least in terms of product launches. However, it was a frontrunner for the development of the technology, as it built the world’s first PV project based on such panels. Has this strategy paid off?
Helena Li: We were not really late, probably only later than JinkoSolar. We had no urgency to invest immediately, as the technology’s yield plus the stability and the cost, were still not competitive until probably the last quarter of last year. Longi also started to announce moving towards n-TOPCon reluctantly this year. It’s because everybody is waiting for the maturity of the production equipment. So we see now that equipment is okay, and then the wafer can go at least 10 µm thinner, which can be a great cost-saving for n-type TOPCon to compete with p-type PERC.
How much TOPCon capacity will Trina Solar have at the end of 2023?
We expect to reach a TOPCon cell capacity of over 40 GW this year. Work on Phase II of our 15 GW monocrystalline silicon ingot project for n-type products at its factory in Xining, Qinghai province, has begun. Work has also begun on its 10 GW n-type high-efficiency cell and 10 GW n-type module project in Yangzhou, Jiangsu province, which will be put into production in the first half of 2024.
Is Trina Solar considering other technologies, such as heterojunction, interdigitated back contact (IBC), or eventually perovskite-silicon tandem?
Yes, we are considering new developments, although probably n-type TOPCon would last longer than people are thinking, because HJT itself may not be the best solution from what we are seeing. We find more interesting perovskite silicon tandem technologies and we are currently seeking to reach module efficiencies of over 28% with our R&D department. Mass production, however, may need time.
Do you expect oversupply and consolidation to come, given the current expansion plans of most manufacturers?
Oversupply is a natural challenge to our industry. Whoever is stronger will get stronger and stronger every year. And with the complexity now with technology and with the supply chain, and with this geopolitical situation, consolidation is inevitable. We will see cost and price drops because that’s where we want to go. We are now seeing many new players, some are not from solar, jumping in. So I think it’s also challenging and interesting to see you have to always survive, whoever is coming. So I don’t think it’s an issue.
Does Trina Solar plan to start production overseas?
We are actually actively working with our European customers and partners to build a factory there, but we would move forward only if a project can be competitive. Of course, it will be important for us to know whether we may receive support from the EU or local governments. On the other hand, many European customers are telling us they want traceability. When we then tell them they should pay a bit more for these premium products, they say they will think about it and others disappear. As I said, much will depend on the competitiveness of a European factory.
Would it be possible investing in EU or US solar manufacturing without incentives?
No, not without the incentives.
Which markets will drive solar growth in 2023?
China will be, again the largest market. I just heard S&P is predicting solar demand may exceed 136 GW in China this year. This growth should be partly driven by new public tenders for utility scale PV, but we also expect strong growth in the distributed generation segment.
Which emerging markets might perform particularly well for Trina Solar this year?
The development of renewable energy has been accelerated by the global energy transition. The global PV industry will be full of challenges and opportunities in 2023. Looking further into the future, Trina Solar predicts that the global newly installed capacity may reach 1,344 GW in 2035, which is about five times higher than in 2022. Trina Solar value customers in each market segment. We have scenario-based solutions for both p-type and n-type products for residential, C&I, and large scale power plants. Trina Solar is positioned as the leading smart energy total solutions provider, consisting of smart solutions for tracker, energy storage and multi-energy systems. That will help each market.

As solar comes to play a larger role in energy systems the world over, the technology has to learn to cope with harsher terrains and climates, and to operate for longer lifetimes with minimal performance loss as well.
There is a wealth of research into the many different mechanisms that can start to affect the individual components in a solar module when installed outdoors for a long period of time, and the industry has shown that it can rapidly adapt when unexpected problems are discovered.
A group of scientists led by the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands has conducted an exhaustive review of literature on PV cell and module degradation published over the last 30 years. Their work seeks to provide a detailed guide to the main stress factors faced by PV modules in the field, and a component-by-component guide to the common degradation and failure modes faced by each.
Their guide, Review of degradation and failure phenomena in photovoltaics, is published in full in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. Among the key findings they take from looking into the existing research this way is that the next step for improving module reliability is to understand the combined effect of multiple stresses over different time periods and develop tests that can take this into account.
“Quality and reliability testing has come to a stage where the durability of each component under a single stress can be predicted well, but accurate reliability estimations for a combination of materials under a combination of time-varying stresses remain challenging,” the group explains. “Building on this knowledge, strategies to improve the operational lifetime of PV systems and thus, to reduce the electricity cost and improve the sustainability can be devised and lifetimes of PV modules can be extended.”
They note efforts by DuPont with its module accelerated sequential testing, the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s combined accelerated module testing, and Europe’s Solliance’s in-situ degradation method as leading the progress in this area.
“All three combine multiple stress factors such as light, humidity, temperature, rain, mechanical load and voltage stress,” the group states. “It is worth reminding that stress factors and stress levels in the outdoors are uncontrolled and time-varying, while conventional accelerated life testing approaches have a more monotonous character.”
The paper also praises the PV industry and research communities’ quick reactions in developing tests to give advance warning of weakness to degradation mechanisms as they are discovered – such as with potential-induced degradation. And the scientists warn that the full combination of factors must be considered with any new material solar producers plan to take up.
“New materials must work within the whole module package and in concert with the other materials present,” the scientists add. “Agnostic combined stress tests need to be used, so that also unknown, new failure modes related specific designs or BOMS may be triggered during the development phase. Standardisation of such agnostic stress tests will be instrumental in the further development of long-lifetime modules and the necessary market acceptance and appreciation of long-lifetime claims.”
