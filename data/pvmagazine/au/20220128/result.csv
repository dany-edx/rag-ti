The system, featuring panels supplied by South Australian-based manufacturer Tindo Solar, occupies the entire roof space of the Bendigo Centre and will help the bank reduce its carbon footprint and energy consumption. The new solar panels add to those installed when the building was built in 2008 to power its hot water system.
Bendigo and Adelaide Bank managing director Marnie Baker said the installation of the 200 kw system commenced in December and in the six weeks since it was switched on the solar array had produced about 50 MWh of renewable energy and provided 15% of the building’s power.
The bank described the result as “a great start considering the commercial building has significant energy needs 24 hours per day”.
Baker said the latest solar installation aligns with the bank’s commitment to purchase 100% renewable energy by 2025 and reduce absolute emissions by 50% by 2030.
“Our bank’s fundamental purpose is to help customers and communities to succeed by securing prosperous futures. In recent years the expectations of customers and investors have evolved to the point where they want to see how the Bank is contributing to a more sustainable future as well,” she said.
“Building the Bendigo Centre for efficiency, and subsequently making improvements by installing these solar panels, is an example of our long-term commitment to sustainability, reducing our carbon and environmental footprint, improving our resilience, and better understanding the dependencies we have on the natural environment.”
As part of its renewable energy commitment, the bank will install solar systems on the roofs of 20 bank branches throughout 2022, most of which will feature Tindo panels. More than 30 Bendigo Bank branches across Australia already use energy derived from solar power.

Tindo Solar chief executive officer Shayne Jaenisch said the bank had made a powerful commitment to renewable energy, while also supporting Australian jobs and innovation.
“Bendigo Bank was Australia’s first significant bank to have a policy to not lend to businesses directly engaged in coal mining, oil and gas production and logging of native forests,” he said.
“Bendigo Bank is supportive of businesses in the renewables industry and the bank financed Tindo Solar’s new $11.5 million factory that will be producing panels in early 2022.”
Jaenisch said the Tindo panels were built for reliability, safety and performance under Australian weather conditions.
“Australia has a harsh climate and the average age of solar panels in this country is around eight years,” he said.
“We warranty ours for 25 years which means the bank will get the full financial return on their investment and the full benefit for the environment.”

The power arm of Philippines-based brewing-to-energy conglomerate San Miguel Corporation (SMC) is moving on its ambitious plan to deploy 1GW of batteries this year, with its first, 20MW/20MWh project now ready to provide ancillary services to the grid.
The Kabankalan battery is the first utility scale project controlled by a grid operator in the Philippines and the first operational energy storage asset on the Visayas regional grid, which hosts the largest amount of solar generation capacity in the country.
Kabankalan is also the first energy storage system in a 470MW/470MWh portfolio German and U.S.-owned energy storage joint venture Fluence has been contracted to supply and maintain for the SMC Global Power unit of the Filipino conglomerate.
SMC Global Power this month said it was ready to start operation of an initial 690MW of battery storage facilities as part of a plan to complete 31 energy storage systems this year, with an accumulated capacity of 1GW.
The company’s battery portfolio started to take shape last year when SMC revealed it was nearing completion on projects nationwide. It announced 31 batteries would be deployed this year, not only to improve power reliability and help frequency control, but also to pave the way for the integration of 3GW of intermittent renewables capacity.
At the time, SMC president Ramon See Ang said his company would build solar plants in combination with battery storage at 10 locations. These are scheduled to go online by next year.
Kabankalan is the first battery in SMC’s portfolio to enter commercial operation. The project was unveiled last year when Fluence said it had commissioned two 20MW/20MWh batteries for SMC Global Power. With project sites ranging in size from 20-60MW, the SMC portfolio procured with Fluence is spread across 13 sites.
Located in Negros Occidental, Kabankalan is only the second grid scale battery in the Philippines, following a 10MW/10MWh system at the Masinloc Power Plant in Zambales, also supplied by Fluence, in 2016.
The new system is the first such asset in the country to be directly controlled by the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines, using automatic generation control to provide grid stabilisation services including managing frequency and voltage, and supplying reactive power. Such services are critical for ensuring the stability of regional electricity grids across the Philippines which are often plagued by power outages.
Fluence said the Kabankalan project was delivered on time despite challenges stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic, including supply chain delays, worker travel restrictions and coordinating construction amid complex on-site rules.
“Each new battery asset we and SMCGPH [SMC Global Power Holdings] bring online strengthens the Philippine grid, adding flexibility in the right places and with the right capabilities to support the nation’s energy transition,” said Fluence president for Asia-Pacific, Jan Teichmann. Fluence will continue deploying storage systems for SMC’s portfolio of projects across the Philippines through July, with additional facilities planned for commissioning and testing in “early 2022.”
SMC’s battery-based energy storage portfolio is reportedly the largest such procurement to date in Southeast Asia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/28/renewables-drive-new-records-in-december-quarter/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 28, 2022",Renewables drive new records in December quarter,"The Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) latest Quarterly Energy Dynamics report reveals that renewables, including grid-scale wind and solar and distributed PV reached a 34.9% share of generation in the National Electricity Market (NEM) in Q4 2021.
AEMO said instantaneous renewable penetration achieved a new high of 61.8% in the December quarter, up marginally from 61.4% in the previous quarter while average renewable penetration levels for the quarter increased more significantly from 31.6% in Q3 2021 to 34.9%.
AEMO’s executive general manager of reform delivery, Violette Mouchaileh, said the record levels of renewables – including continued growth in grid-scale solar output which at 269 MW exceeded wind output growth of 156 MW – coupled with below-average temperatures contributed to new records for minimum operational demand in the NEM during the quarter.
New minimum operational demand records were seen in New South Wales (NSW) which dropped to 4,425 MW, down 211 MW on the previous minimum (4,636 MW) set in 1999, Victoria which declined 196 MW from 2,529 MW to 2,333 MW, and South Australia which dropped from 236 MW to 104 MW.

Minimum operational demand for the NEM as a whole fell to a record low of 12,936 MW, down 1,257 MW on the previous low set in Q3 2021. The quarterly average operational demand fell to 19,876 MW, its lowest Q4 average since 2005.
“Grid-scale solar, wind, hydro and rooftop solar PV continued to displace thermal generation, with black coal-fired generation falling to its lowest Q4 average since 1998, while gas generation declined to its lowest Q4 average since 2003,” Mouchaileh said.
Daytime electricity prices also continued to fall during the quarter, the first in which the NEM operated with five-minute settlement (5MS).
“The changing generation mix saw zero or negative spot prices occurring during 16.6% of all dispatch intervals during the quarter and a total of 11.2% for 2021, more than doubling 2020’s average of 4.9%,” Mouchaileh said.
NEM mainland electricity prices averaged $39 per MWh in October but reached $75 MWh by December, lifted by rising prices in Queensland with growing volatility in that state and in South Australia. For the quarter as a whole, mainland prices averaged $57 MWh, still below Q3’s average of $66 MWh but 31% higher than Q4 2020’s $44 MW.
“While underlying spot prices fell or were stable in the southern NEM regions, the larger share of thermal generation in Queensland and NSW and higher prices being set by black coal and gas, as well as limitations on transfers of lower cost energy from the southern regions, each contributed to an average $45 MWh north-south price differential,” Mouchaileh said.

Queensland’s price of $97 MWh was its highest Q4 average on record, more than double the level of one year ago, with price volatility in November and December lifting the region’s average by $27 MWh.
Conversely, Victoria’s quarterly average price of $28 MWh was its lowest Q4 average since 2014.
In Western Australia’s Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM), increasing levels of renewables met nearly 40% of total underlying demand in the quarter and established a new minimum operational demand record.
“Similar to the NEM, unabated rooftop solar PV investment set a new minimum operational demand record of 761 MW on 14 November 2021, a 12% decrease on the previous record. During this 30-minute interval, rooftop solar PV met 67% of the total underlying demand,” Mouchaileh said.
“Unlike the NEM, a four-day heat wave event in the WEM from Christmas Day set a new Q4 maximum operational demand record at 3,869 MW on 27 December, just 137 MW lower than the all-time maximum demand set in February 2016,” she said.
The increase in renewables also led to a 16% reduction in gas and distillate-powered generation.

InterContinental is also developing renewables-based green hydrogen projects in Oman and Saudi Arabia.
In total, InterContinental’s global renewables portfolio comprises 200 GW of onshore wind and solar capacity which would support the production of more than 14 million tonnes a year of green hydrogen or 80 million tonnes a year of green ammonia.
GIC, established by the government of Singapore in 1981 to manage the nation’s foreign reserves, announced on Thursday it had taken a “strategic equity investment” in InterContinental.
“This is a strategic investment to position GIC early for the emerging hydrogen economy,” said GIC’s chief investment officer of infrastructure, Ang Eng Seng.
“We believe that in time, hydrogen will play a crucial role in decarbonisation globally and that InterContinental Energy will be a key player in this transformation.”
InterContinental is one of the key players in some of Australia’s biggest green hydrogen projects, including the proposed $100 billion Western Green Energy Hub on the southern coast near the South Australian border.

The proposed mega-project would be the world’s largest renewable hub if realised, with a massive 50 GW of wind and solar farms to be spread across 15,000 square kilometres. The wind and solar would power electrolysers to produce either 3.5 million tonnes of green hydrogen or, alternatively, 20 million tonnes of green ammonia yearly.
InterContinental is also part of the consortium behind the $50 billion Asian Renewable Energy Hub being developed in the east Pilbara region. The proposed 26 GW project will see wind turbines and solar modules installed across some 6,500 square kilometres. The facility would be used to power 14 GW of electrolysers to produce 10 million tonnes of green ammonia a year.

InterContinental chief executive Alexander Tancock said the firm “has an ambitious vision, together with our partners, customers, and stakeholders, to deliver green fuels at scale, and we are excited to have GIC on board as an investor, who share the same long-term commitment to global decarbonisation”.
The investment by GIC, which is estimated by the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute (SWFI) to manage funds of more than $1 trillion, is seen as a major boost for the projects which are both currently in the process of gaining approvals and conducting feasibility studies.
Financial close for the Western Green Energy Hub is targeted for after 2028, with start-up in about 2030. A final investment decision on the Asian Renewable Energy Hub is expected in 2025 with the first exports tipped to commence in 2027/2028.
The size of the investment by GIC, which is estimated by the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute (SWFI) to manage funds of more than $1 trillion, was not revealed.
The investment remains subject to approval by the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/28/india-deal-to-drive-australian-hydrogen-startup-h2xs-global-expansion/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,INDIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 28, 2022",India deal to drive Australian hydrogen startup H2X’s global expansion,"Australian hydrogen-powered vehicle maker H2X Global has signed a binding agreement with Indian automotive components manufacturer and supplier Advik Hi-Tech establishing a joint venture (JV) company to manufacture and market hydrogen fuel cells, generators and vehicles in India.
H2X has retained a 49% stake in the JV company with Advik, which has more than $100 million in annual revenues, to hold the majority share.
The new JV will manufacture fuel cells, generators and vehicles designed and developed by the Victorian-based H2X team and will build a global supply chain of products and components for hydrogen-powered vehicles and powered products.
H2X, led by automotive industry veteran Brendan Norman who has worked for BMW and VW in Australia and Asia, said in a statement production is “scheduled to start immediately to cater for the rapidly growing demand for hydrogen-powered equipment and vehicles in India”.
Norman said the Indian market is critical to the long-term success of the hydrogen industry and H2X’s partnership with Advik will be critical to the company’s growth.
“We have long believed India is one of the great manufacturing powers of the world and we have found a great player in the automotive Industry in Advik,” he said.
“The cooperation between our companies gives us great strength in being able to address India but also to provide us with a strong manufacturing backbone to support our production activities in Australia and other parts of the world as well.”

According to its website, H2X has developed its own proprietary fuel cell and powertrain system. This system is at the crux of the company’s various light equipment vehicles. These are expected to include a van, minibus, SUV, and a ute. The technology itself is designed to drastically reduce refuelling time and increase driving range.
In a joint statement, the two companies said they had for the past 12 months been working together for the past 12 months to explore opportunities for hydrogen in India and the JV will establish them as a key player in the booming market.
“India is destined to be a leader in the hydrogen industry with strong support from government and industry and as a company which has always been ahead of the curve we are aggressively pushing into the hydrogen space as a core growth area for our company and as a leader of this movement in the country,” Advik managing director Aditya Bhartia said.
“We have great confidence in the product range from H2X as being one with several key opportunities to support to deployment of hydrogen in the Indian market and together with our local knowledge and expertise we see great opportunity to develop this for acceleration of the Indian clean energy movement.”
A core manufacturer and supplier of automotive components to almost all major original equipment manufacturers, Advik will not only manufacture H2X’s fuel cells, generators and vehicles. It will also supply the Australian company with products and components and will use its existing network to distribute H2X’s products into the Indian and international markets.
The JV company is set to commence manufacturing operations with production of H2X’s series of hydrogen powered generators.
H2X said it currently has two of these units ready for deployment in Australia but the first generators manufactured by the JV will be put into service with a large-scale power system to be installed at Advik’s research and development centre in Pune, India.
The first products from the JV are set to be delivered to the market within the coming few months, with the power system in Pune being the highlight of the launch of the venture.

“The opportunity for us to be able to launch a product to the Indian market at this early stage is reflective of the passion we have at Advik to lead our country and the world in terms of being active in new technological advancement,” Aditya said.
“We strongly believe that through our partnership with H2X we come into a position where we can become a global leader in the hydrogen revolution and strongly position the growth of hydrogen in India as a strong pillar of growth into the future.”
H2X is also looking to establish manufacturing operations in Malaysia after signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the state-owned Sarawak Economic Development Corporation (SEDC) to form a joint venture for the manufacturing, assembly and development of a range of hydrogen-powered vehicles.
Under the agreement, the JV will manufacture a range of vehicles, including H2X’s Warrego ute, as well as buses and hydrogen-powered generators.
H2X has also teamed with SEDC and renewables developer Thales New Energy to develop a 1.3 GW hydrogen export facility powered by hydroelectricity in Sarawak.
The agreement with see the trio form an incorporated JV to develop the Samalaju Hydrogen Production Plant, which is proposed to be capable of producing as much as 170,000 tonnes per year of liquid hydrogen or 970,000 tonnes per year of ammonia for export.

A Chinese-Egyptian research group has investigated how rooftop PV may be coupled with thermoelectric coolers (TEC), which are also known as Peltier heat pumps as they operate according to the Peltier effect. This effect creates a temperature difference by transferring heat between the two electrical junctions of a semiconductor-based electronic component, which is the key element, working as a small solid-state heat pump. According to the research team, TECs have the advantage of being easy to install and refrigerant free as well as having no movable parts and offering resilient operation.
The proposed combination was labeled a solar thermoelectric air-conditioning system (STEACS) and its performance was analysed through a machine learning prediction model known as a random vector functional link network (RVFL), which is a randomised version of a single-layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN). The latter is the simplest kind of neural network, in which there is only one layer of input nodes that send weighted inputs to a subsequent layer of receiving nodes.
The RVFL was used in combination with four different techniques: the Jellyfish Search Algorithm (JFSA); the Artificial Ecosystem-based Optimisation (AEO); the Manta Ray Foraging Optimisation (MRFO) model; and the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA). Through the four models, the academics assessed the PV-fed current, the cooling power, the average air chamber temperature, and the coefficient of performance (COP) of a PV-powered STEACS for air conditioning of a 1m3 test chamber under diversified cooling loads varying from 65 to 260W.
The system was built with six solar panels, an air duct system, four batteries, a charge controller, TECs, an inverter, heat sinks, a test chamber, and condenser fans. “The TECs were mainly connected with the air duct arrangement and placed close to each other [and] were placed between the air duct and heat sinks,” the researchers explained. “When direct PV current was fed to TECs arranged on the sheet of the air duct system, one face [became] cold, defined as a cold air duct, and another side [became] hot, called “hot air.” The air ducts were composed of an acrylic enclosure wrapped with a protection sheet.”
Six rectangular finned heat sinks were linked to the hot side of TECs for increasing heat dissipation and an aluminium foil was wrapped over the air duct to avoid heat losses. Under this configuration, the STEACS was able to provide up to 272W of cooling power.
The modelling based on the RVFL combined with the Jellyfish Search Algorithm (JFSA) was found to outperform the other three hybrid models in predicting the system performance. “The determination coefficient (R2) of the predicted PV input current by RVFL-JFSA during the training stage was equal to unity for PV input current, average chamber temperature, and cooling capacity; while it was 0.999 for COP,” the scientists explained. “The values of R2 are slightly decreased during the test stage, to be 0.993899, 0.999282, 0.995293, and 0.948428 for PV input current, average chamber temperature … cooling capacity, and COP, respectively.”
The model was proposed in the study “Modeling of a solar-powered thermoelectric air-conditioning system using a random vector functional link network integrated with jellyfish search algorithm,” published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering. The research team includes scientists from the Zagazig and Tanta universities, in Egypt, as well as from the Henan Institute of Science and Technology, in China.
