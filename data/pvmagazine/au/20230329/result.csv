The investment from state-owned Horizon Power into West Australian Alternative Energy (WAAE) is intended to “address the renewable energy sector’s wide-ranging supply chain issues, which are impacting the delivery of equipment and projects, as well as a constrained local workforce,” Horizon said.
The partnership between the two companies came after WAAE successfully completed Horizon Power’s Kalumburu hybrid solar project in the Kimberly region in 2022.
The microgrid project involved a 700 kW solar farm and a 1.78 MWh battery capable of meeting the majority of the 400-strong community’s power needs. While the system still included a diesel genset, the microgrid was designed to be able to run completely on renewable energy when weather allowed.

The project was the first of six renewable energy systems to be rolled out in the Kimberley as part of Horizon’s Remote Communities Centralised Solar Project which will see up to 4 MW of solar PV installed in six remote communities.
The $11.6 million scheme will see solar and battery systems installed in the Warmun, Ardyaloon, Beagle Bay, Djarindjin, and Bidyadanga communities as well.
This is an example of a much bigger push within Horizon Power to transition most of its service area to renewable standalone power systems and microgrids which have emerged as clear frontrunner for the utility in terms of both cost and climate targets.

The program is part of the state government’s $11 million commitment to train its solar workforce, a bid to secure ongoing skilled workers for the sector. The mentoring will be delivered face-to-face and on site by industry experts from the Institute of Electrotechnology, the National Electrical and Communications Association and TechSafe Australia.
“We are committed to developing, upskilling and supporting workers in the renewable sector, and want more licensed electrical inspectors to feel comfortable in taking on solar work,” Solar Victoria CEO Stan Krpan said.
Victoria’s Solar Homes program, launched in 2018, aims to install solar on 770,000 homes, boost solar hot water-system installation by 60,000 and support the addition of batteries to 10,000 homes over a ten year period.

The report supports the general consensus that storage capacity needs grow significantly over coming decades, pointing to a figure of between a 10 to 14-fold between 2025-2050.
Overall, the report is commonsensical and more of an overview of information in the public domain. It is broken down into different industries and offers brief summations of various storage technologies and where they could best be used.

The report also looks at the maturity of technologies, a neat recap for a quickly evolving industry.
Lithium-ion batteries and pumped hydro remain overwhelmingly favoured in Australia, but the chief science agency says “all forms of energy storage must be considered to meet Australia’s growing demand across multiple sectors.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/29/renewable-investors-new-platform-to-diversify-and-streamline-assets-attracts-superfund-backing/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 29, 2023",Renewable investor’s new platform to diversify and streamline assets attracts superfund backing,"Infrastructure and real assets manager Palisade Investment Partners has launched what the company is describing as “the next phase in its renewable energy investment strategy.” Named Intera Renewables, the new platform has initially aggregated five of Palisade’s operational renewable assets into a single entity with a common ownership, governance, management and financing structure – working toward scale and streamlining.
Conceptually similar to the platforms Octopus Australia launched in 2022, the offering seems to focus on building a diverse portfolio of renewable assets to create more stable, “derisked” returns for potential investors while generating funds to develop new projects. 
Palisade currently owns and operates six wind farms and one solar farm spread across Australia’s east. These assets total nearly 1.5 GW of installed capacity, making Palisade one of Australia’s largest renewable energy investors.
Intera’s five seed assets include Hallett 1 Wind Farm and Snowtown 2 Wind Farm, both in South Australia, Granville Harbour Wind Farm in Tasmania, Macarthur Wind Farm in Victoria and Ross River Solar Farm in Queensland. These assets have a combined capacity of ~1 GW, and first 12-months EBITDA of ~$150 million (USD 100 million) per annum, according to Palisade. Presumably the platform will seek to invest in solar, storage and other non-wind projects shortly to diversify the technology of its assets.
Superannuation funds Hesta and Aware Super are existing partners in Palisade funds or assets, and are now transferring that position to a holding in the new Intera Renewables platform. The Australian government’s green bank, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), also has a stake in the platform, which is majority owned by Palisade’s Renewable Energy Fund, holding a 50% stake.
“In establishing Intera, Palisade has executed a $1.3 billion single portfolio financing facility secured against the combined pool of Intera assets, replacing existing individually financed asset level debt,” Roger Lloyd, CEO of Palisade, said.
Palisade Integrated Management Services will provide operational management services to Intera.

South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) recently published the 10th Basic Plan of Long-Term Electricity Supply and Demand. It reduces the 2030 renewable energy target from 30.2% to just 21.6%.
Last week, a group of 24 civic organisations filed to revoke the plan at the Seoul Administrative Court.
“The government said that the target reduction was in consideration of the public acceptance and feasibility related to renewable energy deployment,” Eunji Kim, a researcher at Seoul-based NGO Solutions for Our Climate, told pv magazine.
Kim said the change will act as a signal to the market and will affect the entire renewable energy market.
“With government goals and policies drastically changing from one administration to the next, the unpredictability will unsettle investors who would shy away from actively investing in clean energy businesses and projects in the weakening renewable energy industrial ecosystem,” he added. “Moreover, this makes it difficult for changes favourable to renewables to take place.”
Kim said the South Korean government plans to scale back its feed-in tariff policy and reduce the amount of renewable energy certificates (RECs) issued under the renewable portfolio standard (RPS) scheme for 2023 and onwards.
“The size for the solar PV bid under South Korea’s Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) scheme has been set to 1,000 MW – a 50% decrease compared to the same period last year, when 2,000 MW for each procurement exercise was allocated,” Kim said. “It looks like the renewable curtailment problem will only get worse with the latest plan decreasing the minimum output of fossil fuel power plants.”
The South Korean Energy Agency held two 4 GW of PV tenders last year. In the two tenders held in 2021, it allocated capacity in 2 GW and 2.2 GW rounds, and contracted 1.2 GW and 1.4 GW in 2020. South Korea’s new electricity plan has increased the 2030 target for nuclear power from 23.9% to 32.8% and the target for liquefied natural gas (LNG) from 19.5% to 20.9%.
