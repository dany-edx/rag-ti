The NSW government announced this week the first stage of its Smart Energy Schools Pilot Project had commenced. The program will see participating schools explore the use of solar PV panels and batteries to generate electricity for themselves and create enough to supply renewable energy to the state’s grid.
The pilot program is the largest of its kind in Australia with about 4,600 solar panels and 3.2MWh of battery energy storage capacity being installed at participating schools. A VPP trial, using smart software to manage the charging and discharging of energy storage systems across multiple schools will also be conducted as part of the program.
The state government said about 15MW of solar has already been installed at 1,500 NSW public schools but changes in technology have created opportunities for electricity customers to participate in new energy markets by storing and trading energy and other services.
Minister for Education Sarah Mitchell said the Smart Energy Schools Pilot Project will test the most efficient and effective way for schools to take part in this exciting transition.
“We now have 60 schools testing the most effective ways to harness and deploy renewable energy back to the electricity grid,” she said.
“We have over eight million square metres of NSW public schools roof spaces and we are looking at how we can utilise this space to reduce electricity costs and improve the environment.”
The pilot project will be rolled out in two stages, with participating schools receiving new or extra solar and battery energy storage systems.
The first stage of the project will test whether school-based solar and battery storage systems can help reduce demand on the electricity system associated with air conditioning. It will also test whether solar and battery storage can be used to avoid costly upgrades to the electricity grid.
Schools in the second stage of the project were selected based on their suitability to combine solar and battery systems as part of a VPP.
The solar, batteries and VPP systems are now being installed in the schools, with the installations expected to be complete by the middle of the year. The VPP trial is expected to begin by July 2022.
NSW Treasurer and Energy Minister Matt Kean said the trial will help the state government meet its commitment of net zero emissions by 2050.
“We know that solar is one of the best ways to slash the state’s energy bill and emissions,” he said. “Adding cloud-based virtual power plant software means that energy generated on site can be used, stored or shared with other schools or homes via the electricity grid.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/20/cannon-brooks-cements-stance-ahead-of-agl-demerger-vote/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 20, 2022",Cannon-Brooks cements stance ahead of AGL demerger vote,"Australian tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes’ firm Grok Ventures has become the single largest shareholder in AGL after this week settling an 11.28% stake in the public company worth $650 million with financial services company JP Morgan.  The trade gives Cannon-Brookes, who is waging a public campaign to stop the demerger, voting rights over the shares ahead of a scheduled June 15 vote.
Cannon-Brookes had gained the initial stake in AGL earlier this month after Grok Ventures, the private investment company he owns with wife Annie, had failed in an earlier $3.8 billion takeover attempt with Canadian investment firm Brookfield Asset Management.
The initial stake was in a derivative that meant the shareholders of the borrowed stock could “recall” it at short notice. Grok said in a statement it had instructed JP Morgan to carry out a series of trades on Tuesday to “simplify” its interest in AGL by converting them into physical shares. Grok now owns the shares.
“Grok has now invested approximately $650 million to build its relevant interest of 11.28% in AGL shares, with close to $600 million funded with cash and the remainder with debt,” a Grok spokesperson said.
“Only 1.21% remains subject to JPM’s right to recall shares under stock borrow arrangements in certain circumstances. At this point in time, JPM has not recalled any shares.
“Grok is confident that they will be able to vote the full 11.28% at the relevant time, against the demerger.”

AGL is planning to split into two separate entities – green energy retailer AGL Australia and generator Accel Energy which will control the existing coal-fired assets, including the Loy Yang A power station in Victoria, and the Liddell and Bayswater power stations in New South Wales.
AGL said moving forward as two independently listed companies would give the retail business and the generator business the individual freedom to pursue their own agendas, and the board remains committed to delivering on the proposed demerger which will be put to a shareholder vote next month.
Cannon-Brookes wrote to all 150,000 AGL shareholders on Monday, labelling AGL’s plan “flawed” and said he would vote his shares against the demerger.
The tech billionaire said the merger proposal “confirms the board’s lack of leadership and a strategy that misses one of Australia’s biggest economic opportunities, decarbonisation”.
“We believe this is a deeply flawed plan that will deliver a terrible outcome for AGL shareholders, workers, customers, Australian taxpayers and the planet,” he wrote.

To go ahead, AGL’s plan requires approval from 75% of the votes cast. With Cannon-Brookes holding 11.28% of the shares, only a further 14% would need to oppose the split in order for the demerger plan to be blocked.
Cannon-Brooks’ stance appears to have already attracted the support of some, including Australian pension fund HESTA, which owns a 0.36% stake in AGL.
HESTA has indicated it is “unlikely to support” the demerger unless AGL sets a clear strategy to invest in renewables and storage and “strong commitments” to close coal-fired power plants earlier than currently proposed.
AGL announced it February it would bring forward the planned closure of the Bayswater black coal plant to “no later than 2033” and Loy Yang A power station in Victoria to 2045. The Liddell power plant is scheduled to close in April 2023.
The shareholder’s vote on AGL’s proposed demerger is scheduled for June 15.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/20/consumer-watchdog-sounds-warning-for-lg-branded-home-batteries/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,LEGAL,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 20, 2022",Consumer watchdog sounds warning for LG-branded home batteries,"The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) on Friday warned the affected batteries, equipped with cells from specific production lots manufactured between March 2017 and September 2018, can overheat and catch fire, which could lead to serious injuries, death and property damage.
South Korea’s LG Energy Solution issued a recall in February 2021 for an estimated 7,200 of the affected batteries which were installed primarily in LG, SolaX or Opal branded home energy storage systems.
LG has said it will replace all affected batteries free of charge but the ACCC said about 6,400 of the affected batteries have not yet been replaced and it is concerned these consumers may not be aware of the recall and the fire risk.
The consumer watchdog said since October 2019 the potentially dangerous batteries have been linked to nine fires in Australia and five in the United States, causing property damage and injuries to two people.
“We encourage consumers to urgently check if they have an LG, Solax or Opal solar energy storage battery which is included in the recall by LG,” ACCC deputy chair Delia Rickard said. “These batteries have already caused injury and fire damage to properties and could lead to serious injuries or death.”
Rickard said the ACCC has been working with state and territory electricity regulators to raise awareness of the recall. Licensed electrical contractors who have installed or worked on systems with affected batteries are also encouraged to proactively contact these clients about the recall.

“Consumers who identify they have an LG energy storage battery under recall are urged to immediately contact LG to discuss next steps, including a free replacement when available,” she said.
“The affected batteries have also been supplied in solar energy storage systems with brand names other than LG, so it is extremely important to check if you have a battery affected by the recall by checking the serial number on the LG website.”
Western Australia’s Commissioner for Consumer Protection Gary Newcombe said the owners of the affected batteries should act quickly.
“Product recalls are sometimes met with apathy, but this is not the time to hesitate or delay,” he said. “Immediate action needs to be taken before the fire risk results in damage to your home or potentially an injury or death.
“I urge owners of LG solar batteries in their home to check the model numbers on their units and treat this issue with the utmost urgency.”
The recalled batteries were available for sale at various times between April 2017 and December 2019. The affected models are RESU3.3, RESU6.5, RESU10, RESU13, RESU7H Type-R, RESU10H Type-C, RESU10H Type-R, RESU10H Type-R (Secondary), S/A Gen2 1P (EM048063P3S4) and S/A Gen2 2P (EM048126P3S7).
Electrical regulators recommend switching off the battery. If consumers wish to switch off the battery, they should refer to the instruction manual of their energy storage system or contact the installer or manufacturer for advice.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/20/updated-standard-means-change-for-rooftop-solar-installers/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 20, 2022",Updated standard means change for rooftop solar installers,"The Australian solar installation standard AS/NZS 5033:2021 is now in place with the Standards Australia Committee removing the mandate for direct current (DC) isolators to be installed on residential solar PV systems if other safety measures are followed.
The updated standard was first introduced in November 2021 but for the past six months solar installers have been able to apply either the new AS/NZS 5033:2021, Installation and safety requirements for photovoltaic (PV) arrays standard or the previous AS/NZS 5033:2014 version when installing a rooftop solar system.
The transition period ended on 19 May 2022 with installers around the country now required to comply with the updated standard.
The key change delivered by the new standard focuses on DC isolators, which were mandated in Australia in 2012. This made Australia the only country in the world requiring the installation of rooftop DC isolators.
Intended as an additional safety mechanism that shuts down solar PV systems in case of an emergency, the mandated use of DC isolators has been the subject of much criticism. In Australia, DC isolators are typically installed on roofs next to solar panels, which exposes them to the elements and critics say they are the primary cause of solar-related fires.
Standards Australia said the new standard has been designed to reduce that risk by providing installers different options on how solar systems can be isolated and no longer mandates the installation of a DC isolator on the roof for all installations.
Standards Australia standards development head Roland Terry-Lloyd said the revision allows solar installers to keep pace with innovations across the solar industry.
“With millions of solar PV panel systems being installed across Australia, clear and relevant standards are paramount in supporting safe practice for industry professionals, homeowners and businesses,” he said. “The revised standard aims to provide clear and relevant guidance to support safe systems and safe practices for industry professionals and consumers.”
The standard, which has been restructured for better readability, sets out general installation and safety requirements for electrical installations of PV arrays, including DC array wiring, electrical protection devices, switching and earthing provisions.
The revision includes several other updates, including requirements for microinverter installations and DC conditioning units, which it says will enable greater use of technology across larger panels and support better safety outcomes. It also increased the 600V limit for panels on households to align with the international standard of 1000V.
The new standard aligns with international standard IEC 62548:2016, Photovoltaic (PV) arrays — Design requirements.

The $150 million Sustainable Household Scheme, introduced in 2021, provides interest-free loans of up to $15,000 for households to meet upfront costs of renewable energy assets including rooftop solar modules, household battery storage, efficient electric appliances and electric vehicles (EVs) and EV charging infrastructure.
Chief Minister Andrew Barr said more than 5,000 households have already applied for more than $55 million in loans under the scheme with rooftop solar systems and combined solar and battery packages leading the charge as most popular products.
“The Sustainable Household Scheme was designed to allow more Canberra households to benefit from a households investments like rooftop solar panels,” Barr said. “ACT residents, particularly in Belconnen, Tuggeranong, and Gungahlin, have purchased a combined 20MW of roof top solar though the scheme which is equivalent to the power generated by Royalla Solar Farm.”
ACT Energy Minister Shane Rattenbury said the scheme will build on the ACT’s achievement of 100% renewable electricity and will help ensure the territory meets its target of net-zero emissions by 2045.
“Canberrans are playing a significant part in generating the ACT’s 100% renewable electricity supply,” he said. “Canberrans recognise the value solar has to our clean, green and affordable energy future.”
The government said the Sustainable Household Scheme will soon be opened to community organisations.

Researchers from Khalifa University in the United Arab Emirates have conducted a techno-economic analysis of a building energy system based on standalone rooftop PV linked to either lithium-ion batteries, proton-exchange membranes reversible fuel cells (PEM RFC), or reversible solid oxide cells (RSOC). They have found that each of the proposed configurations could result in low capital costs and high efficiency.
The scientists quantified the impact of the PEM reversible fuel cells and reversible solid oxide cells on overall system degradation. Their modelling considered a typical medium-sized commercial building in Los Angeles, California. Its minimum value of electricity demand was 18.79 kW during the night, with a maximum demand of 178.30 kW in August. The rooftop solar array was assumed to have a capacity of 400 kW, with 310.15 W SPR-E19-310-COM solar modules with 19% efficiency from US manufacturer SunPower.
The 250 kW reversible solid oxide cell system – equipped with an air preheater, water boiler, and high-performance heat exchangers – was assumed to have a power density of 0.312 W and an overall system efficiency of 43.99. The fuel cell has a capacity of 251.4 kW, a power density of 0.284 W, with a total system efficiency of 31.18%.
The cost of the reversible fuel cell was estimated at around US$667/kW and that of the reversible solid oxide cell at US$500/kW. The costs were based on a modelled 250 kW PEM stack cost and 250 kW reversible solid oxide cell stack cost, at 10,000 units per year. The battery is based on a nickel-manganese-cobalt cathode and graphite anode, and has a storage capacity of 400 kWh. It has a round-trip efficiency of 92.5% and a cost of US$339/kW. Its lifetime is more than 5,000 cycles.
The academics found that the PV system can achieve a levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of US$0.0237/kWh. The levelised cost of storage (LCOS) of the reversible fuel cell, reversible solid oxide cell and the battery was US$0.04173/kWh, US$0.02818/kWh, and 0.02585/kWh, respectively.
“The breakdown of the LCOS shows that capital cost accounts for more than 65% of the total LCOS, making it the most important component that needs more R&D to bring the capital cost down for these energy storage technologies,” they explained.
They found that the LCOS increases and the discharge decrease depended on the lifetime of each of the three storage technologies they used.
“The LCOS is sensitive to changes in capital costs, round-trip efficiency, lifetime, and discount rate; therefore, changes in these parameters should be carefully considered,” they warned, noting that lithium-ion batteries offer the most economical solution along with maximum efficiency, while also noting that reversible fuel cells and reversible solid oxide cells can improve a standalone building’s reliability and resiliency.
The scientists presented their findings in “Techno-economic analysis of energy storage systems using reversible fuel cells and rechargeable batteries in green buildings,” which was recently published in Energy.

Ambient Photonics secured US$31 million (AU$44 million) in Series A financing for a solar cell production facility, led by Amazon through its Climate Pledge Fund, and Ecosystem Integrity Fund, Future Shape, and I Squared Capital also participating in the round.
Ambient Photonics develops a unique low-light energy harvesting photovoltaic (PV) technology that the company reports can generate as much as three times more power than conventional technology. Its cells are made using an industrial printing process through which proprietary energy harvesting molecules are applied to thin and durable glass substrates to create cells of virtually any size and shape.
Compared to semiconductor vacuum manufacturing methodologies, Ambient said its rapid production process is efficient, scalable and lower cost. Ambient works with global smart home and Internet of Things (IoT) device manufacturers on embedded solar cells. The technology reportedly can deliver power density from a broader spectrum of ambient light.
By powering smart home and IoT devices with embedded solar cells, batteries are not needed—thus reducing landfill waste.
“Disposable batteries are both a consumer inconvenience and a significant environmental problem,” stated Matt Peterson, director of The Climate Pledge Fund at Amazon. “We are excited that through The Climate Pledge Fund we will invest in Ambient to help in their path toward creating innovative solutions to decrease the carbon footprint of battery-operated devices across industries.”
“We believe Ambient has the potential to catalyse more sustainable systems across growing global industries, including consumer electronics, smart home and IoT. Ambient’s technology offers the first viable solution to cost-effectively power these devices with clean, renewable energy,” said Sasha Brown, partner at EIF.
Ambient will also progress its Part II application for a US$162 million (AU$231 million) loan guarantee under the US Department of Energy (DOE) Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program. The facility is expected to provide hundreds of local jobs while also reducing Scope 3 emissions.
“IoT sensors are everywhere. And each one has a battery that gets replaced and added to toxic trash,” said Tony Fadell, Nest founder and author of Build. “Ambient Photonics’ revolutionary low light solar cells bring us within reach of the Holy Grail: a batteryless, wireless IoT network.”
Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund was launched with $2 billion in funding from Amazon and is intended to support the development of sustainable technologies and services that will enable Amazon and other companies to meet climate goals a commitment to be net zero by 2040. Amazon and Global Optimism co-founded the commitment program, called The Climate Pledge. The pledge includes a commitment to reach the Paris Agreement threshold 10 years early. Verizon, Reckitt Benckiser (RB), and Infosys have also joined the pledge.
