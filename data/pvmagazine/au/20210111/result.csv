The biggest share of Sunny Central inverters — the current SMA model of choice, soon to be usurped by the Sunny Central UP line — went to Neoen’s 460 MW Western Downs Green Power Hub, which will be the largest solar farm in Australia to date when it reaches scheduled completion in 2022. 
“Being part of that is huge for us,” says Joshua Birmingham, Director of Project Sales for SMA Australia.
He names Gold Fields’ Agnew Gold Mine project that integrates solar, wind, gas and diesel generation in a 56 MW microgrid as another proud achievement, telling pv magazine, “We see enormous growth in the offgrid market and in the north-west of Western Australia, so being involved in Agnew is also a big win.”

Getting down and hands-on dirty, whether in mining or the morass that was the West Murray disaster zone, is a hallmark of SMA’s commitment to the Australian renewables industry, which Birmingham says is part of the key to maintaining the lion’s share — 65%, says SMA — of the local utility-scale market.
In April 2020 when SMA engineers collaborating across the globe came up with an inverter-based solution to the seven-month severe curtailment of five West Murray solar farms found to be causing voltage oscillations in the West Murray region of the grid such that stability of electricity supply was threatened, the cheer that went up must have been audible on the moon.
Not only did the fix stop the combined million-dollar-a-day loss in revenue to those solar farms, but the successful, hard-won resolution meant that the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) could again begin processing applications from other projects in the region queuing to connect, and it strengthened confidence in the ability of projects in more remote parts of the grid to deliver their renewable riches to the National Electricity Market (NEM).
The solution involved tuning SMA’s inverters — which were deployed by all five affected West Murray generators —to play in time with one other, reducing the “chaotic noise” of each potentially beating their own drum, Scott Partlin, Head of Service, and previously Head of Engineering for SMA Australia, explained to pv magazine back in April. 
And therein lie two other secrets of SMA’s deserved success in Australia: its in-country team of some 60 skilled employees, many of whom have long experience with the idiosyncrasies of the NEM; working with “the technical superiority of our equipment to deal with weaker grid connections”, says Birmingham.
SMA executives are typically modest and forbearing in speaking out against the shortcomings of others, but Birmingham says that, “If those five West Murray plants had been Schneider plants, well, Schneider has walked away from the utility PV market, so it wouldn’t have been helping.”
As it was, the five plants, and other West Murray renewable projects waiting to connect to the grid, which did have SMA inverters either installed or on order, had more than a snowflake’s chance of getting up and running — if a little later than expected due to the long cold freeze on project connections prior to SMA’s nutting out of a tuneful solution.
SMA’s sales continue, and Birmingham anticipates 500 MW of new capacity joining the SMA family during the first quarter of 2021. Plus the repowering market — replacing the inverters of other manufacturers that are unable to perform to AEMO’s satisfaction — is just getting started.
Although he says that, “To this point in time,” SMA is “very happy” with where it sits in terms of market share, and the esteem in which it is held in the Australian market, it isn’t complacent.
“We’re seeing increasing competition from Chinese inverter manufacturers,” specifically Sungrow and Huawei, says Birmingham.
“They both achieved their first connection approvals last year,” and FRV’s 85 MWac Winton Solar Farm is currently being tested in Victoria with Huawei inverters. 
And of course, Spanish inverter company Ingeteam has been consistently performing in the Australian market; in the New Year it announced a 2 GW total power base of solar across this wide sunny land, including the 160 MW Maryvale Solar Farm, which lies within New South Wales Central-West Renewable Energy Zone.

Juan Miguel Gutiérrez, the director of Ingeteam Australia, said in the company’s January announcement that although 2 GW is “a nice, round number, the important thing is that it reaffirms the confidence that our customers are placing in our solutions, in a market in which the technical requirements demanded by the power companies and grid operator are probably the toughest in the world”.
According to Rystad Energy’s Senior Analyst in Renewables Research, David Dixon, SMA has 62.6% of the Australian utility-scale market share, and Ingeteam is its closest rival with 22.5%.
The next defining factor in Australia’s inverter market will be the successful deployment of grid-forming technology, as opposed to the currently used grid-following technology. SMA and GE are among the companies testing new systems at the dangling edge.
Where grid-following inverters rely on the spinning reserve of large fossil-fuel-driven turbines — or their non-productive yet still spinning stand ins, synchronous condensers — to set the tempo of voltage waveforms, grid-forming inverters can set their own pace without the inertia generated by large spinning pieces of hardware. 
So when your solar farm is hanging out at the end of the line, where land is cheap and the sun is all but uninterrupted, a long way from spinning machinery, voltage patterns can become weak or inconsistent. Without an inverter that can create a steady wave pattern, your output is likely to threaten grid stability and be disallowed. 
Birmingham says SMA is “commencing modelling of grid-forming plants, both solar and storage”, and that he expects the first grid-connected, grid-forming plants to be commissioned in 2022.
“Grid-forming inverters vastly improve the ability of solar plants to connect in low-system-strength conditions,” he explains, adding that in Germany SMA inverters have been used to “form” grids for whole towns such as the Bordesholm project, allowing them to run completely independently, even if just for an hour, of any kind of traditional generation or spinning reserve. Birmingham says, “It’s the future.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/11/nsw-coal-country-gets-a-big-grid-balancing-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",NATALIE FILATOFF,"JANUARY 11, 2021",NSW coal country gets a big grid-balancing battery,"A joint venture between Australian companies Edify Energy and Precinct Capital has lodged a development application with Newcastle City Council to build a utility-scale battery on 0.6 hectares of land within the Steel River Estate industrial area, on the South Channel bank of the Hunter River, in the Newcastle suburb of Mayfield West.
“Deploying this battery in the heart of Newcastle’s industrial precinct will help balance the power system for the city, keeping the lights on for industry and households throughout the region,” said Precinct Capital’s Chairman, Bruce Baudinet.
Although not directly associated with solar or wind generation, but intended to charge and discharge directly from the grid in response to disturbances or market signals, the 28 MW/56 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) “will facilitate the further deployment of renewables by providing grid stabilisation”, Edify Energy’s Chief Executive John Cole, told pv magazine today.
He added, “The project is aligned with the objectives of the NSW Electricity Strategy and NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap”, as well as with the Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO’s) 2020 Integrated System Plan, all of which “call for dispatchable electricity technologies to enable a firmed renewable energy supply from Renewable Energy Zones”.
The Hunter region was recently identified as the state’s fifth key Renewable Energy Zone by the New South Wales Minister for Energy and Environment, Matt Kean, but remains some way down the planning track after the 3 GW Central West Orana and 8 GW New England REZs.
Steel River, pending development and planning approval will get ahead of the REZ curve, supporting in the short term both additional utility-scale renewables and rooftop solar penetration into the grid, to meet local and state renewable energy targets.

Edify Energy is one of a handful of renewable energy investors and developers to have successfully brought a large-scale battery to the Australian energy market.
It is responsible for Victoria’s 25 MW/50 MWh Gannawarra Energy Storage System (GESS), the first such system to be retrofitted to work in tandem with a solar generator, in this case the 60 MW Gannawarra Solar Farm. Supported with grant funding by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and the Victorian Government, it was commissioned in late 2018, and continues to deliver learnings on how batteries can be deployed.
“One of the things we’ve learned is the multi-use application of these lithium ion batteries and what they can do for the network,” says Cole, who adds, “It’s such a dynamic space at the moment, if you stand still for five minutes, everything’s changed.”
An operational report on the GESS released by Edify in August 2020 provided key insights into the asset’s first two six-month periods of operation, including that the battery’s “performance in the energy market … was assisted by highly volatile days, where the supply / demand balance was tight”; and that, “Regulation FCAS performance has exceed expectations and has been the stand-out revenue generating performer for the asset since becoming registered in June 2019″.

Steel River BESS is expected to be given the go ahead to begin construction in late 2021 or early 2022, by which time, Cole says, the price of battery technology will likely have fallen further, and markets will have evolved for “ancillary services that batteries can operate into”; the potential is always for capitalising on volatilities in the energy spot price, buying low and selling high, and network companies will increasingly contract for system support and grid stabilisation services.
“There are myriad ways” to contract batteries, says Cole. At Steel River, the company has already received interest “from utilities, retailers, even businesses looking to diversify into energy”, he adds.
The project is the first of its type for Precinct Capital, a family office which has been investing in and developing business-parks, self-storage facilities and residential construction on Australia’s eastern seaboard since 1981.
A statement released by Precinct and Edify just before Christmas said, “The decision to build the battery followed research by Precinct Capital which pointed to a growing large-scale battery storage industry in Australia.
It recognised that the land it held within the Steel River Estate was suitable for battery development and strategically located close to large industrial energy users such as the Tomago aluminium smelter. Other high-energy neighbours include Horan Steel, Port Hunter Conveyors and Ullrich Aluminium.
Mayor of Newcastle, Nuatali Nelmes said the project aligns with the City of Newcastle’s objectives as outlined in its Climate Action Plan, for firming renewable energy supply and building resilience in the local electricity network.
The city has been a leader in sustainable practices, including powering many council facilities with solar, building the 5 MW Summerhill Solar Farm for its own supply and in January 2020 it became the first NSW Council to be powered by 100% renewable sourced electricity.

Construction of the new BESS is expected to take between six and nine months and will create around 20 jobs during that period, as well as opportunities for local subcontractors in civil works, electrical installation, landscaping and so on.
Tesla provided the battery technology at Gannawarra, and Cole says that for Steel River, Edify and Precinct Capital are in discussion with  “a number of equipment providers”. The decision has not yet been made whether to go with a turnkey solution from one provider, or to take on development themselves, combining technologies from different OEMs.
Edify Energy operates one of the largest portfolios of solar farms in Australia, including Darlington Point, Whitsunday, Hamilton, Gannawarra, Daydream and Hayman solar farms, and Cole says the company has learned that what it originally viewed as passive assets, must be viewed as dynamic participants in the NEM.
“They don’t operate like a conventional machine, or a large spinning mass. We’re bidding those power plants into the market every five minutes.”
Batteries he says will also be operated dynamically according to market needs and opportunities.
He likens the “generational” change of the Hunter region to that of Collinsville in Queensland, where Edify Energy operates four solar farms (those with “island” names in the list above): “That was a big coal mining town and the solar farms have been very well received up there — we’ve had every school student, primary and secondary, visit those solar farms. It’s all part of the transition,” he says.

Elangperdana Tyre Industry produces high performance radial tyres for the Indonesian and international tyre markets, as well as radial and conventional tyres for light trucks and buses. 
“This solar project will play an important role in reducing our carbon emissions,” said Dicky Mursalie, Managing Director of Elangperdana, in a statement which claims the installation will displace an annual 117,500 tonnes of CO2.
Singapore-based Cleantech Solar, which was founded in 2014 by a group of former Barclays executives led by present Cleantech Chairman Raju Shukla, has more than 500 MW of commercial and industrial (C&I) solar projects in operation, construction or development across India, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and in Singapore itself.
In 2016, it installed a 1.81 MWp system for Apollo Tyres in the Chennai industrial region of Oragadam, India, producing not only 2.5 million kilowatt hours of clean energy per year, but also providing shading and thereby lowering the temperature of the plant’s manufacturing unit.
Tyre manufacture is energy intensive, with the mixing of materials (including rubber, carbon black, sulphur, silicon and chemicals), calendaring (the incorporation of steel belts or fabric reinforcement in to the tyre material) and curing (applying pressure and heat to stimulate bonding between tyre materials) of the “green” tyres the biggest energy consumers among the 10 or so processes involved.
For Elangperdana, Cleantech Solar will develop and operate a turnkey solution and guarantee the performance of the solar PV system over the lifetime of the 25-year agreement signed last week.
Shukla said Cleantech Solar is “delighted to partner with Elangperdana in helping them to make this transition towards renewable energy”.
Cleantech specialises in financing, constructing and operating projects for Tier 1 and Fortune 100 companies throughout the region, enabling businesses to achieve environmental and cost-saving targets with zero upfront capital investment.
Last June, the pan-Asian solar developer secured Asia Pacific’s biggest ever green loan for C&I rooftop solar development with US$75 million in financing from ING Bank.
At the time, ING’s Lead for Renewables and Power in the Asia Pacific, Adrian Lian, said that the international financier was “thrilled to have combined Cleantech Solar’s strengths with ING’s renewables expertise to arrange a specially structured solution to support their business”.

In January 2019, Cleantech Solar became the second major solar investment of Shell Eastern Petroleum, which acquired a 49% stake in the company with the possibility of increasing its share this year, in 2021.
“We are very impressed by Cleantech Solar’s record of developing lasting relationships with multinational and regional corporations who are eager to implement subsidy-free renewable energy into their corporate strategies,” said Marc van Gerven, Shell’s then Vice President of Renewable Power.
Cleantech’s offtakers to date include Shell itself, at its lubricants plant in Taloja, Maharashtra, India; Bosch, at its first SMART factory in Thailand; Safran Landing Systems’ manufacturing plant in Malaysia; Molnlycke Health Care’s medical solutions manufacturing plant, also in Malaysia; and 19 Tesco Lotus stores across Thailand.
Most recently, pv magazine posted news of Cleantech Solar’s completion of four solar plants, totalling 4.2 MW of capacity on Cargill food and beverage production sites in Thailand.
The Elangperdana project will be one of Indonesia’s largest ever rooftop solar installations, and contributes to the country’s target to increase the share of renewables in its national energy mix to 23% by 2025.
Mursalie noted, “Situated in tropical Indonesia, the project will work in our favour, as sunlight is a very abundant natural resource here.”
