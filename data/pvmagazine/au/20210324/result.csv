One moment AGL is Australia’s biggest emitter, and then the wheel is slowly turned and the big ship pivots. Sometimes the shifts are incremental, steering adjustments of what seems mere degrees, and yet the ship will end up in a vastly different place than it would have without the adjustments. 
Earlier this week, AGL announced that it is forging ahead with plans to establish a 200 MW grid-scale battery at its Loy Yang power station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, having lodged a planning with the state government. That’s a few degrees in the transition to clean energy right there. 
Today, AGL has announced that construction on a 250 MW one-hour duration grid-scale battery at the site of its Torrens Island power station in South Australia had been given the green light. The battery had originally been slated as a four-hour-duration system but that is now being kept as an expansion plan. The most important thing though, as Jay Gatsby would tell you, is the green light. 
Getting construction underway on one of the grid-scale batteries that will eventually make up 850 MW of battery-based assets AGL has committed to build by 2024 is another significant shift in steering that will turn the big ship of AGL toward a new destination in the clean energy transition. 
AGL chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said battery technology is key to enhancing the energy system’s flexibility while leading Australia’s energy transition and ongoing integration of renewables.
AGL has also signed non-exclusive framework agreements with energy storage technology companies Fluence and Wärtsilä to supply up to 1 GW of large-scale battery storage.
Earlier this year, AGL was branded the nation’s biggest polluter, emitting more than 42 million tonnes of carbon emissions in 2020, but has promised to transition to “full decarbonisation” by 2050 and said batteries would be crucial in that process.
“It is through low emission firming technology, like batteries, that we are continuing to drive AGL’s energy transition and respond to the accelerating market forces of customer demand, community expectation and the development of technology,” said Brokhof.
The company has plans to build utility-scale batteries at its Liddell power station (150MW) and at Broken Hill (50MW) in New South Wales and has announced support for battery projects at Wandoan (100 MW) in Queensland and Maoneng (4 x 50 MW) in NSW. It is already operating the 30 MW/ 8 MWh BESS at Dalrymple in South Australia.
“We’re excited to be giving the green light to the Torrens grid-scale battery,” said AGL managing director and CEO Brett Redman, “the first one in the AGL network that is under development, and I’d like to thank Minister van Holst Pellekaan for his support and commitment to this project.” 
“We put forward our vision for this project less than six months ago and with the hard work of our team and support from the South Australian government we are now ready to make this a reality,” continued Redman, “…we know this battery will be instrumental in maintaining reliable and affordable supply for households and businesses in South Australia in the years ahead.” 
South Australian Energy Minister, Dan van Holst Pellekaan said South Australia will soon have a new ‘biggest battery’, funded by the private sector, which is a strong vote of confidence in our government’s energy policies.
“This will be the fifth grid-scale battery in our state, and the fourth one built since the last state election,” Minister van Holst Pellekaan said. “This investment shows the confidence the private sector has in South Australia’s energy sector, as a result of the world-leading well managed renewables focus of the Marshall Government.”
AGL is one of a number of gen-tailers, developers, network owners and service providers to announce new battery projects in recent months as the search for essential stabilising services to the grid ramps up as coal-fired generators are retired.
EnergyAustralia earlier this month announced it would replace its Yallourn coal-fired power station in the Latrobe Valley with a four-hour 350 MW capacity big battery. Neoen announced plans in January for a 500 MW / 1000 MWh big battery to be built west of Sydney, while later that month Origin Energy announced it would build a 700 MW mega-battery with a dispatch duration of four hours at the site of its ageing Eraring Power Station in the NSW Hunter region.
With construction now underway AGL believes the Torrens Island battery will be fully operational by early 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/24/genex-pours-115-million-into-queensland-pumped-hydro-plant/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 24, 2021",Genex confirms construction to begin on 250 MW Queensland pumped hydro plant,"In a statement to the ASX on Wednesday, Genex said it would raise $90 million through an offering of shares to institutional investors while Japanese electric utility J-Power will make a $25 million equity investment, further increasing its stake in Genex.
Also on Wednesday, Genex confirmed the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) had conditionally approved up to $47 million in funding for the pumped hydroelectric energy storage (PHES) facility in far north Queensland, which will be located alongside the existing 50 MW Kidston Solar Farm.
Genex said the latest funding announcements, in conjunction with previously approved $610 million in concessional debt finance from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, would provide the $777 million in funding required for the construction of the pumped hydro project, and associated transmission infrastructure, to commence.
“Today’s announcement, securing the balance of funding required to take the Kidston Pumped Storage Hydro Project to financial close, is a significant achievement for the company,” Genex CEO James Harding said.
“More importantly, to be in a position to finance the project on a 100% equity basis and retain full ownership and control of the asset is a favourable outcome for Genex and its shareholders.”

ARENA CEO Darren Miller said the project will be the first pumped hydro plant to be built in Australia in almost 40 years, and the first to be used specifically to support the integration of variable renewable energy generation from solar and wind.
Miller said the PHES plant would provide reliable, dispatchable and affordable renewable energy to the grid.
“This is a landmark project for all involved and paves the way for renewables to play a larger role in Australia’s electricity grid,” he said.
“Genex will be delivering the first pumped hydro project in Australia since 1984 and the first to be used solely for energy storage and generation rather than water management.”
Part of Genex’s enewable energy hub, located at what was once Australia’s largest gold mine, the project is a 250 MW / 2,000 MWh PHES, equivalent to eight hours of energy storage.
Two existing mining pits at the former gold mine site will serve as the upper and lower reservoirs for the PHES to minimise construction time and costs. During peak power demand periods, water will be released from the upper to the lower reservoir, passing through reversible turbines. During off-peak periods and when the sun is abundant, water will be pumped back from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir using electricity imported from the National Electricity Market (NEM).

A 187km transmission line will be required to connect the Kidston Renewable Energy Hub to the NEM. This transmission line is also expected to facilitate the connection of further renewable generation projects in the region.
“Large-scale storage will play a key role in ensuring security and reliability of Australia’s electricity system as we transition to renewables,” Miller said.
“Pumped hydro is expected to be a key technology enabling us to store abundant solar and wind energy when it is available and dispatch this energy back into the grid during the evening and other times of peak demand, so it is imperative these projects get underway.”
Genex said project construction costs are expected to total $583 million while the company will contribute $111 million towards the construction of the transmission line with the Queensland Government to contribute $147 million. Genex said $83 million had been set aside for financing costs and project contingency.
The Sydney-based developer said financial close is expected to occur in mid-May with construction activities to commence ahead of this in late April. Construction is expected to be completed by 2024.
EnergyAustralia is to be the project offtake partner for a period of up to 30 years. A joint venture of John Holland and McDonnell Dowell is the EPC contractor.
“Having championed this project from conception, and having supported pumped hydro feasibility studies across Australia, we are very excited to see this project reach financial close and commence construction,” Miller said.

MPower was responsible for the full design and construction of the two solar farms as part of an estimated $9 million deal struck with project principal Astronergy Solar Australia, a subsidiary of Chinese module maker and EPC contractor Chint Energy.
Grid connection, including first energisation of the Kadina and South Hummock solar farms follows the commissioning phase which commenced at both sites last month.
MPower chief executive officer Nathan Wise said both projects, which comprise approximately 17,000 solar modules each and utilise single-axis tracking technology, are expected to reach commercial operations in the coming weeks and then be capable of exporting power at full capacity to the grid.
“It’s great to see MPower achieve another successful milestone on a 5 MW solar project,” Wise said.
“The successful delivery of renewable energy projects highlights MPower’s capability and dependability bringing projects of this size to market, on time and to budget.”

Wise said the successful connection and energisation of the two projects increases to five the number of 5 MWac solar farms MPower has achieved grid connection with, including the Mannum and Pirie solar farms, also in South Australia.
Wise said MPower had deliberately targeted smaller utility-scale projects in part to the relative ease of connecting to the grid and is actively pursuing new engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) opportunities in this niche segment of the renewable energy sector.
MPower is also planning to develop its build, own and operate (BOO) strategy, with Wise telling pv magazine the company is looking to “leverage the expertise it has developed over many years of designing and constructing solar, energy storage and microgrid projects”.
MPower’s strategy involves securing rights over potential renewable energy sites during or at the end of their development phase and acquiring the renewable development assets once the development phase has been completed and the projects have reached ‘ready to build’ status.
“Our shift towards building, owning and operating our own assets brings together our financial and investment capabilities together with our technical and project expertise and enables MPower to extract greater value out of each project opportunity,” Wise said.

MPower is aiming to roll out an initial portfolio of up to 20 renewable energy assets with an aggregate capacity of 100 MWac and an estimated value of more than $150 million once fully constructed.
Wise said the company’s BOO strategy is progressing well with MPower already securing exclusivity over six solar farm development sites across Victoria and South Australia.
“We look forward to progressing these projects through the development phase and, if successfully developed, commencing the design and construct phase in due course,” he said.
“Our aim is to secure renewable energy development sites at scale, each capable of delivering up to 5 MWac and to progressively build, fund and operate the assets.
“We expect to report exclusivity on more sites very soon beyond the first six. Market conditions remain particularly favourable for our sector with demand continuing to grow for renewable energy sources.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/24/cornwall-calls-for-co-ordination-to-avoid-12-gw-excess-generation/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 24, 2021",Cornwall calls for co-ordination to avoid 12 GW excess generation,"New research from Cornwall Insights Australia predicts that by 2030, when all states and territories’ renewable targets have been delivered, there will be a staggering 12 GW excess generation, including from wind and solar, across the entire NEM in the middle of an average day.
Cornwall’s senior policy and regulatory consultant Franklin Liu said excess generation would present a challenge to the stability of the NEM, which interconnects Queensland, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania, and delivers about 80% of all electricity consumption in Australia.
With most state governments already committed to forcing renewables into the grid at record pace, Australia’s transition to renewables has been impressive but Liu said the lack of consultation and co-ordination could make for a problem.
The Clean Energy Regulator (CER) revealed in its December Quarter 2020 Quarterly Carbon Market Report that by the end of 2020 Australia had installed 32 GW of renewable energy capacity, including a record 7 GW in 2020 alone.
“NEM states have committed to a headlong charge towards their respective renewable targets by 2030,” Liu said.
“Although, with 12 GW of excess generation across the NEM, it is unclear if the states have consulted each other on their individual policies’ impact.
“Additional interconnectors are of no help if all regions are trying to export. So, it begs the question, what can be done to manage this excess supply at midday?”

Liu said while excess supply can be transported across time by storage, he warned the predicted oversupply dwarves the 2 GW Snowy 2.0 and a few GWs of other storage planned by the government and the industry.
“They could also push out coal and gas,” he said, adding it is now widely agreed that the exit of thermal plants will be faster than initially expected, as evidenced by Yallourn’s recent closure announcement.
“This could cause some challenges for grid security during the transition, and the Energy Security Board is looking for a solution in its post-2025 market design package.”
Liu said to better facilitate a smooth transition to renewable energy, states could try planning things better by taking “a more holistic, NEM-wide view together”.
“Rather than focusing on generating more green energy within their borders, states could better utilise their respective advantages and trade with each other,” he said.
“For example, states with better pumped hydro resources could build more of this technology, which could help manage their own and their neighbours’ excess energy. This, in turn, might support more renewable generation across the whole NEM, maybe even without increasing the total cost.
“Interestingly, this sounds more and more like the original design objective of the NEM, which is to promote long-term consumer interests through better trade and co-ordination.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/24/how-to-protect-rooftop-pv-systems-from-fire-risk/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 24, 2021",How to protect rooftop PV systems from fire risk,"From pv magazine Global. 
The Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) and the Dutch Institute for Safety have published a guide to help homeowners or businesses operating a rooftop PV system, or willing to install one, become aware of the fire risks associated with solar power generation.
The guide also provides firefighters with tools to act quickly and safely in the event of an incident and defines the most common fire causes, such as bad system design, inadequate installation, animals chewing on wires, storm damages, manufacturing faults in PV products, including connectors and junction boxes, and heat accumulation, among others.
The basic principle proposed by the TNO experts is that a PV system, including the inverter, must have its own fire compartments, as far as this is possible. These compartments should comply with the Dutch WBDBO requirement, which establish that the fire in a building should be stopped in 30, 60, 90 or 120 minutes, depending on the type of building and its function. WBDBO stands for Weerstand tegen BrandDoorslag en BrandOverslag, which translates to Resistance Fire Bursts and Fire Spread.
“For the layout of a commercial roof with solar panels, we recommend working with surfaces of a maximum of 40 by 40 meters, or 1,600 square meters, as in this way the firefighters can still reach all solar panels during their operation,” the Dutch experts said, adding that a safe space must be maintained between the PV system compartments, also in residential installations. “What is also very important if a fire breaks out is that the firefighters can find all information about the existing PV system in the meter cupboard or at the entrance of the building,” they explained. This should help the firefighters identify the location of the inverter, the possible presence of a storage system, and a fireman’s switch.
The guide is said to be a working paper that will be updated constantly according to adjustments in regulations and technology.
In September 2018, the Netherlands enterprise agency Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (RVO) tasked the TNO to conduct an investigation into fire accidents involving rooftop PV systems reported by Dutch media at the time. In April 2019, the research institute ended its investigation and stated that around 70% of the fires were caused by faulty connectors, and especially by cross-mating, which happens when connectors of different kinds are mated.
In December, Underwriters Laboratories, a U.S. nonprofit standards development organisation, published the new UL 3741 safety standard, which is related to the evaluation of PV hazard control functions.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/24/spanish-solar-renaissance-lifts-world-to-record-year-for-large-scale-projects/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,SPAIN,UNITED STATES",MAX HALL,"MARCH 24, 2021",Spanish solar renaissance lifts world to record year for large scale projects,"From pv magazine Global. 
The 50 GWac of large scale solar project generation capacity added last year marked a record annual return for solar, according to the latest figures gathered by U.K.-based analyst Wiki-Solar.
Equating to 65 GWp of new capacity, the volume added–in terms of officially reported projects–takes the world to 270 GWac of solar capacity, according to the latest annual return.
With Wiki-Solar ranking the top 26 nations by the amount of large scale projects added in 2020 and by cumulative generation capacity, China continued to lead the world, and the lack of public reporting of some projects in the world solar capital ensures the analyst can be prone to underestimate Chinese additions.
The U.S. almost overtook its solar superpower rival–at least in Wiki-Solar terms–with 242 announced large scale projects amounting to 12 GWac of capacity, compared to the 97 projects for 12.8 GWac added, officially, in China.
Spain soared back up the ranking with 52 projects adding 3.9 GWac of capacity, including unsubsidised facilities such as ACS Group’s Escatrón-Chiprana-Samper, which has a 730 MWac footprint and electric utility Iberdrola’s 500 MWac Núñez de Balboa.
Wiki-Solar noted the 29 large projects installed in Australia, for 3.6 GWac of new capacity, indicate grid connection bottlenecks are “gradually” easing and pointed out the arrival of projects subsidised under the SDE+ program helped the Netherlands double its solar capacity, to 1.8 GWac.
It was a different story in the U.K., where just 11 new large scale projects were connected, for 162 MWac of generation capacity last year. Italy and Canada also tumbled down the rankings.
Wiki-Solar is predicting another record this year, provided world number three India can complete all its planned solar tenders and the U.S. can deliver on what promises to be another bumper 12 months. With more than 9.8 GWac of cumulative solar capacity, following the golden years of 2009-12, Spain is likely to join the 10 GWac club in 2021, added the analyst.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/24/holographic-film-to-protect-solar-panels-from-overheating/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,RUSSIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 24, 2021",Holographic film to protect solar panels from overheating,"From pv magazine Global. 
Scientists from South Ural State University (SUSU) in Russia have patented a new technology to prevent PV modules from overheating.
Their special technique consists of a holographic film, based on prismatic concentrators known as “prismacons,” which are made of a transparent material containing holographic lenses of infinitely small dimensions.
“The internal structure of the holographic film is made in the form of miniature pyramids – prismatic concentrators able to effectively capture light rays and, due to their multiple reflection inside the prisms, concentrate on the surface of the solar module,” said researcher Irina Kirpichnikova.

The holographic film was covered with an ultra-thin layer made of unspecified rare earth metals, which purportedly reflect infrared radiation and transmit visible radiation.
“The working principle of a holographic film lies in the fact that the rays of sun hit the surface of the module, while part of the spectrum – the infrared rays – is reflected from the metalized top layer of the film, preventing the module from overheating,” Kirpichnikova explained. “The visible part of the solar radiation spectrum hits the pyramidal structure of the concentrators, and, being repeatedly refracted in them, due to internal reflection, concentrates on the solar cell, regardless of the angle of incidence of the rays on the solar module.”
The low-cost solution is purportedly applicable to all kinds of solar panels, including thermal-photovoltaic devices.
“This solution increases the efficiency of solar modules even in cloudy weather,” Kirpichnikova said, adding that the technique enables variations in the direction of the light rays.
Holographic films are very thin, flexible plastic films that can be laminated onto different types of materials. They can diffract the usable frequencies of sunlight and direct the generated energy toward the solar cells. Their application in PV research is not new, as several kinds of holographic foils and patterns have already been tested in both PV and CPV devices. However, the technology has not been developed for commercial production thus far.
