The initial focus of the state-owned Queensland Resources Common User Facility, to be built at the Cleveland Bay Industrial Park in Townsville, will be on vanadium, a key component in redox flow batteries.
Queensland Treasurer Cameron Dick said once operational, the facility will enable the state to leverage its abundant critical minerals to secure local supply and meet the growing global demand.
“This facility will prepare Queensland for the future of clean energy production through the critical minerals the world needs,” he said.
“This facility will enable smaller mining companies to prove up their product and develop new opportunities for vanadium mining in Queensland.”
“The efficient production of vanadium, used in redox flow batteries could supercharge Queensland’s renewable energy industry.”
It is expected the facility, first announced in 2021, will be operational for vanadium processing in 2025, with capacity to expand over time to allow for the processing of other critical minerals like cobalt and rare earth elements.
Dick said the aim of the common-user facility, to be built between the existing Sun Metals zinc refinery and Glencore Copper refinery, is to accelerate the development of commercial mining projects, promote investment in advanced mineral manufacturing opportunities and enable development of supply chain and supporting industries in the state.
Mining companies will be able to trial mineral processing techniques, demonstrate project feasibility at scale and provide the market with product samples to accelerate commercial development opportunities.
“There is already interest from companies in using the facility, and opportunities for jobs, new manufacturing and processing supply chains and investment to north Queensland is expected follow,” Dick said.
Cimic Group’s minerals processing company, Sedgman, has been appointed the managing contractor to lead the detailed design and delivery of the facility.
Sedgman Managing Director Grant Fraser said the company will now begin to engage other Queensland companies to bring this “state-of-the art facility” to life.

Perth-based Altech has partnered with Fraunhofer to advance the development and commercialisation of its Cerenergy sodium chloride solid state battery energy storage systems. The joint venture is progressing plans to construct a 120 MWh per annum manufacturing facility in Germany.
Altech said the Cerenergy technology relies on sodium ions commonly found in table salt and avoids using rare and expensive metals such as lithium, cobalt, graphite and copper. The company estimated that its battery energy storage systems could be up to 40% cheaper to produce than lithium-ion alternatives.
Earlier this year, Altech unveiled the design of its 1 MWh GridPack but it has now updated that design in a move that allows the battery energy storage units, housed in standard shipping containers, to be stacked atop one another with an electrical connection that is incorporated within the frames enabling an effortless “plug and play” setup.
“This configuration allows for the parallel or series connection of GridPacks to augment the operational voltage,” the company said, adding that the design “minimises the space occupied by grid storage battery packs and eliminates the necessity for separate cooling airflow around the GridPacks.”
The design update comes as Altech revealed it has increased the projected output capacity of the proposed battery manufacturing plant from 100 MWh to 120 MWh per annum.
Altech Managing Director Iggy Tan said that during the final stages of the facility design the group had identified capacity for “significant” expansion of production output without incurring any additional capital costs.
“Initially, our approach to facility design was quite conservative,” he said. “However, as we’ve progressed in finalising the overall equipment operations, it has become evident that we possess the capability to increase our production rate.”
Tan said the company is now entering the final stages of its definitive feasibility study for the manufacturing facility and has already commenced talks with “a couple” of potential off-takers.
“We have a lot of incoming interest,” he said, adding that the company is “focusing on one potential off-taker for all our batteries for the first five years of the project.”

Tritium has its headquarters and a factory in Brisbane but last year opened a factory in Tennessee in the US to access government incentives and tap into the north American market.
In a statement, Tritium Chief Executive Officer Jane Hunter said the company would now be consolidating its global manufacturing operations into its plant in Tennessee, as well as reducing expenses through staff cuts.
“These changes reduce our capital requirements and hasten the timing of the company becoming EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) positive,” she said.
“The implementation of this plan … supports the ongoing market competitiveness and positioning of the company … while bringing our manufacturing operations closer to our largest markets.”
Tritium is among the world’s biggest manufacturers of fast chargers with the company claiming it has a fleet of more than 14,500 chargers across 47 countries but it has struggled to raise capital since it listed on the US-based Nasdaq stock exchange in 2021.
Last month Tritium announced it had recorded revenue of USD 185 million ($292.4 million) for the 2023 financial year, more than double the level of 2022, but the company also reported a gross margin of negative 2% for 2022-23.
Hunter has said the fundamentals of the business remain good but a strategic restructure “is necessary to drive both profitability and shareholder value.”
“This transition is aligned with the company’s plan to be profitable in 2024,” she said.
Tritium said it will retain its research and development operations and testing facility at its Brisbane plant, but will reduce staff numbers and contractors, and reduce expenses on sales, and administration.

Limited, better known as CATL, as it looks to take advantage of the rapidly growing demand for mega-scale renewable energy supply projects that are teamed with large-scale energy storage solutions.
The two parties said the long-term partnership aims to optimise the energy storage solutions available to Quinbrook across its large-scale renewables infrastructure projects, especially those in Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom – a portfolio that currently exceeds 50 GW.
This includes the Sun Cable solar and battery project being developed in the Northern Territory by Quinbrook and consortium partner Grok Ventures.
Quinbrook said it plans to explore the viability of using CATL’s eight-hour and 16-hour discharge energy storage solutions for the Sun Cable project, which is expected to include up to 20 GW of solar and up to 42 GWh of battery storage.
Brian Restall, Quinbrook’s Managing Director for Australia and the co-chair of the company’s global procurement committee, said the supply agreement builds on an already established partnership with CATL, which includes the deployment of CATL battery systems at its Gemini solar and storage project in the US.
“Quinbrook has a long history of working closely with CATL,” he said. “We are impressed by the quality of CATL’s technology … their robust product supply chains and the company’s commitment to investing in research and development.”
“We look forward to continuing our working partnership and assessing the viability of CATL’s ultra long-duration storage solutions as well.”

CATL will initially supply Quinbrook with its EnerC Plus containerised liquid-cooling battery systems with the two companies revealing they are already assessing more than 1 GWh of projects in Australia and the UK.
CATL, which produced 37% of the world’s electric vehicle batteries and 43.4% of energy storage batteries in 2022, is already involved in multiple battery energy storage projects in Australia, including supplying the battery units for AGL’s 250 MW/250 MWh energy storage system at South Australia’s Torrens Island.
It has also secured the contracts to deliver the battery units for the 500 MW/2,000 MWh big battery in Collie in Western Australia and the 200 MW/800 MWh extension to the nearby Kwinana battery.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/09/china-expected-to-dominate-solar-manufacturing-through-2026/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 9, 2023",China expected to dominate solar manufacturing through 2026,"From pv magazine Global
The recent report “How will China’s expansion affect global solar module supply chains?” finds that China’s policy support for and investment in manufacturing across the solar supply chain will keep the country on top in terms of capacity through 2026.
China has invested an estimated USD 130 billion ($202 billion) into its solar industry this year, according to the Wood Mackenzie report. With more than 1 TW of wafer, cell and module forecast to come online in the next year, China will have enough capacity to meet global demand through 2032, the report says.
“China’s solar manufacturing expansion has been driven by high margins for polysilicon, technology upgrades and policy support,” said Huaiyan Sun, senior consultant at Wood Mackenzie, and author of the report. “And despite strong government initiatives for developing local manufacturing in overseas markets, China will still dominate the global solar supply chain and continue to widen the technology and cost gap with competitors.”
The report forecasts that China will hold more than 80% of the world’s polysilicon, wafer, cell, and module manufacturing capacity from 2023 to 2026. In addition, not only will the country dominate in capacity, its product will come at a lower cost. For example, the report says that a module made in China is half the price of that made in Europe and 65% less than that made in the U.S.
This comes as no surprise because, as noted at the recent pv magazine Roundtables US 2023, building a supply chain takes time. It has been just over a year since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the U.S., which includes USD 370 billion to support renewable energy build out. Expert panelists noted that they expect the U.S. to be heavy with downstream solar manufacturing, and “we’ll have to continue to rely on imports from foreign partners for polysilicon, ingots and wafers to the U.S.,” said MJ Shiao, vice president of supply chain and manufacturing for the American Clean Power Association. Shiao estimated that it can take from three to five years to build new polysilicon manufacturing.
The buildout of U.S. solar manufacturing will begin with modules, which Shiao said is the smart way to go to ensure that we meet the downstream demand, then start to look for more of the upstream part of the supply chain to meet domestic demand. But upstream manufacturing takes time, the panelists agreed.
“Despite considerable module expansion plans, overseas markets still cannot eliminate their dependence on China for wafers and cells in the next three years,” Sun said.
The U.S. isn’t the only region seeking wafer and cell capacity. As seen in the chart below, Europe and the U.S. both have polysilicon and module capacity, but fall far short in wafers and cell. Southeast Asia, on the other hand, has nearly matched capacity for cells and modules, with India not far behind. But India is also experiencing a strong build out in solar manufacturing, thanks to strong government policy in the form of PLI incentives, and the Wood Mac report forecasts that India will overtake Southeast Asia as the second-largest module production region by 2025.

As other regions are slower to ramp up cell production, China will continue to be the leader in capacity, holding an estimated 17 times more cell capacity than the rest of the world.
However, it is not without its challenges. The report notes that China has recently announced the termination of more than 70 GW in capacity due to oversupply and competition. This mainly concerns old production lines that produce lower efficiency p-type and M6 cells. Wood Mac analysts expect p-type cells to decline to just 17% of supply by 2026.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/09/novel-algorithm-estimates-global-maximum-power-point-in-partially-shaded-pv-systems/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,"NOVEMBER 9, 2023",Novel algorithm estimates global maximum power point in partially shaded PV systems,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati and the Shiv Nadar University in India have developed a new algorithm for the calculation of the global maximum power point (GMPP) of a partially shaded PV array.
“This algorithm is designed to be adaptable to any scenario derived by setting certain parameters in the generalised series-parallel PV array model,” the research’s corresponding author, Shashank Kumar, told pv magazine. “It’s important to note, however, that it may not be directly applicable to configurations that cannot be converted into this generalised model.”
The GMPP defines the ability of an inverter to sweep the IV curve of a PV system and identify the array voltage at which the global maximum power point occurs. When a PV system is under partially shaded conditions, its output power-voltage characteristic curve generates multiple local peaks. Under these conditions, the conventional MPPT methods could fail to maximise the output power as they track the local maximum power point (MPP) instead of the global MPP (GMPP).
In the study “A novel GMPP estimation technique for series parallel connected partially shaded PV array,” published in Solar Compass, the researchers explained that an accurate estimation of the GMPP of a solar power generator under partially shaded conditions is more difficult to achieve than under uniform irradiance conditions, due to the presence of multiple peaks or local maximum power points (LMPPs) in the power-voltage curve.
The proposed method utilises PV module parameters such as connecting wires and diodes, as well as irradiance and temperature as input data.
It also uses a series of equations to find and sort all of the relevant zero points of the PV array. “It could be said that zero-points approximate the points where the 𝑃 − 𝑉 or 𝐼 − 𝑉 curve of the array changes its shape due to partial shading condition,” the academics explained.
The novel approach also offers a mathematical expression for the iteration voltage based on a generally observed property of LMPPs.
To test the new technique, the researchers ran 2,000 randomly generated partially shaded cases over their generalised model. Half of the cases looked at a 3 x 2 PV array using 252 W modules, with the other half referring to a 4 × 2 PV array with the same modules.
“In 3×2 PV array irradiances of all 6 modules are generated randomly in the range of 100–1100 𝑊 ∕ 𝑚 2 for every single case of 1,000 cases. All the diodes and modules in 3 ×2 PV array are at the temperature of 25 C,” the scientists added. “All the parameters of diodes and temperatures of 4×2 PV array are different, however, irradiances of 8 modules are randomly generated in the range of 100–1100 𝑊 ∕ 𝑚 2 for every case of 1000 cases.”
The researchers found that, in all of the 2,000 simulated cases, the maximum errors and the root mean square (RMS) errors were less than 1%. For the 3 × 2 PV system, the average computational time for each case was 0.3398 seconds. For the 4 × 2 arrays, that time was 1.23 seconds.
To validate their results, the scientists also built an experimental setup and compared their observations from it with the algorithm fed with the same data. “It is seen that the error in the GMPP power obtained using the proposed method is 2.5706% with respect to the GMPP obtained experimentally, which is well within the limit,” they concluded.
“Future enhancements are in the pipeline for the GMPP estimation method. My aim is to develop a more compact formula for GMPP specifically tailored for this generalised model,” Kumar stated.
