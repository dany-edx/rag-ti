Indian renewable energy developer Greenko Group has partnered with Belgium’s alkaline electrolyser specialist John Cockerill to manufacture green hydrogen electrolysers in India. The partnership agreement, signed between Greenko’s arm Greenko ZeroC (GZC) and John Cockerill, will see the two companies build 2 GW of hydrogen electrolyser production capacity.
GZC and John Cockerill will combine their strengths to collaborate in all spheres of market development for green hydrogen electrolysers.
“Pressurized alkaline technology by John Cockerill is well adapted to “large scale” hydrogen applications. Combined with Greenko’s low-cost round-the-clock renewable energy solutions, it will enable the lowest Levelised Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) necessary for the implementation of a large H2 ecosystem on the Indian subcontinent,” read a Greenko statement.
The Gigafactory will comprise the complete electrolyser manufacturing value chain, including state-of-the-art nickel coating. It will produce electrolysers delivering high-purity H2 at 30 bars at the outlet.
Anil Chalamalasetty, Greenko’s CEO and MD said, “Greenko is working towards re-industrialisation solutions for a low-carbon economy. We are partnering with a world-class technology partner in John Cockerill and will jointly develop large-scale green molecule projects in India, accelerating the creation of a hydrogen economy. This partnership will not only help curtail India’s energy imports but also facilitate a turnaround to enable energy exports. And it will strengthen India’s green hydrogen ambitions as part of a wider renewable energy program that will see India run the world’s largest energy transition program.”
Raphael Tilot, John Cockerill Renewables’ CEO, said: “The fight against climate change is part of our mission, and this partnership with Greenko will enable us to contribute to India’s sub-continent emergence as a new green energy hub. India and neighboring countries have abundant natural resources, a large domestic market, and the potential to cater to the growth of this market regionally and globally. On the human side, a collaboration between the Indian and Belgian team have made good progress, and we are very confident in the future developments.”

The Atlas will be the country’s first ever national database of mine waste sites across and will include information on the minerals that could be present. The team also plans to create a methodology to assess if recovering any of these minerals is economically viable, which will be incorporated to help inform investment decisions.
The first iteration of the Atlas will be available in the second half of 2022, Geoscience Australia told pv magazine Australia, and will be updated as new information comes in.
The database will be free and publicly available via Geoscience Australia’s Economic Fairways tool with funding for the project coming from the federal government’s $225 million Exploring for the Future program.

There has been growing interest in looking at mining waste, known as tailings, as well as stockpiles and slag, a steel industry waste byproduct, as potential sources of important minerals for electric vehicles, solar batteries and other renewable technologies. 
Moreover, soaring demand and prices of materials and the subsequent shortages have led to a growing cognisance that supply chains will need to diversify away from centralised points like China and look beyond virgin mining.
“Assessing how mine waste could be reprocessed to generate a potentially large new resource stream is one of the best ways of creating a sustainable supply chain, especially for critical minerals,” research team leader Gavin Mudd, an Associate Professor at RMIT, said.
“Critical minerals such as cobalt and platinum group elements can be recovered as by-products from processing the ores of major commodities like copper and nickel,” Geoscience Australia’s Minerals, Energy and Groundwater Division Chief Dr Andrew Heap added.
Encouraging industry to look to alternative sources like mining tailings and stockpiles, Heap said, will not only solidify Australia’s reputation as a world-leading supplier of critical minerals, but also “ensuring the country retains its best-practice environmental, social and governance credentials” since reprocessing has less environmental impacts and a smaller carbon footprint.
Geoscience Australia said the Atlas will build on an approach pioneered by The University of Queensland and the Geological Survey of Queensland’s Secondary Prospectivity Project, which identifies sites for mine waste recycling across Queensland.
“This project originally focused on the potential for cobalt in copper tailings in the Mount Isa area, before our investigations widened to tailings dams and mine storage facilities throughout Queensland,” Geological Survey of Queensland Director of Minerals Geoscience, Dr Helen Degeling said.
“We are delighted that this concept will now be applied across the country to help meet the growing global demand for new economy metals in a more sustainable way.”
Australian companies are already moving on this opportunity, with Western Australian miner Iluka Resources announcing earlier this month that it plans to build the country’s first rare earths refinery and will start by using its own mining stockpiles as an input.
Likewise, Western Australian companies Neometals and Critical Metals reached a major milestone in their recovery of battery-grade vanadium from steel slag stockpiles in Europe last month. 
Considered a looming issue in Australia, turning mine tailings into a valuable resource could also be a promising solution for the rehabilitation of mine sites.
University of Queensland Associate Professor Anita Parbhakar-Fox said the method could make more financial and environmental sense than other mine rehabilitation options. “Based on some of our field investigations, we have demonstrated that you could turn waste into a gold mine, literally,” she said.
RMIT’s Gavin Mudd agrees, saying the remediation of historic mines to modern standards from the new opportunities to reprocess waste would be a great outcome for both Australian communities and the environment.
Mining companies are being encouraged to help build the Atlas by allowing researchers to sample mine waste at their sites.

Now Japanese energy giant Osaka Gas has entered into a joint development agreement that puts considerable heft behind the project.
What is more, Aqua Aerem’s chairman and Sanguine managing director David Green has also revealed that it in discussions with other potential partners for the purchase of its green hydrogen, and is in the process of increasing the scale of the project to 20 GW, “to meet the quickly developing demand for green hydrogen as companies position to deliver on their international commitments.”
According to Aqua Aerem (literally ‘water-air’ in Latin), for every one kilogram of hydrogen produced, nine litres of water is required. The company’s patented proprietary technology captures water from the atmosphere in arid environments using off-grid solar energy, with no waste other than air. This commercial quantity of water can then be used in solar electrolysis whereby water is split into its constituent parts, namely hydrogen and oxygen.
Considering the scale of renewable energies required for green hydrogen production, necessarily requiring lots of sun and wind, usually hot and arid regions are best situated. Of course, such regions don’t tend to have much water. Technology which enable significant quantities of water to be obtained from the atmosphere provides a serious advantage, and are demonstrable of the increasingly fecund solar-water nexus. 
Desert Bloom aims to utilise that technology to produce green hydrogen for domestic and export markets using off-grid renewable energy generation and atmospheric water.
The joint agreement was ratified on Tuesday and will see the two companies develop the project, which Aqua Aerem said will produce approximately 410,000 metric tonnes of green hydrogen annually when it is completed.
Osaka Gas is no stranger to large quantities, as it is one of the world’s largest gas buyers and distributors, with a global portfolio of energy projects, pipelines and LNG terminals.
“We are pleased to be collaborating with Osaka Gas on the further development of Desert Bloom Hydrogen, which is the most advanced, shovel-ready green hydrogen project in Australia,” said Aqua Aerem CEO Gerard Reiter.
“This deal is a strong endorsement of the massive value of the project and Aqua Aerem’s innovative air-to-water technology, which is opening the door for green hydrogen projects to be located where the best renewable power sources are available, which is generally in the driest areas of the planet.”
NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner welcomed the announcement and noted that the green hydrogen sector was to play a key role in meeting the NT’s economic targets.
“Today’s announcement is great news for the Northern Territory, for Australia and for Japan, as we strive to reach our shared destination of net-zero emissions by 2050″ said Gunner.
“This major project is also providing a big boost to our economy, with around 1,000 jobs to be created during construction and a further 120 once it is operational, and we look forward to marking many more important milestones along the way.”
The atmospheric water extraction system and hydrogen generation units are contained in multiple modular and portable solar-powered Hydrogen Production Units (HPUs) capable of generating “water, heat, electricity, and hydrogen, meaning each is a set of containerised solutions that can operate independently.” This independence garners versatility as well, and outside of green hydrogen Aqua Aerem sees potential applicability in mining and agriculture, as well as the alleviation of water scarcity.
Unlike desalination, Reiter says the advantages of generating water from air means no grid connection is required, there’s no brine to dispose of, it has fewer inefficiencies and fewer ongoing costs. Considering the water challenge is one of the biggest barriers to green hydrogen production in water-stressed regions with the best renewable resources, this technology could prove a breakthrough.
“Desert Bloom Hydrogen will produce revenue from the installation of the first module and does not require large upfront expenditure, including investment in large infrastructure that may become stranded or suffer from technological obsolesce,”  said Green. “As a result of these substantial savings, Desert Bloom will be on track to produce green hydrogen at an export price international customers want to pay – less than $US2/kg within five years.”
“An equitable global energy transition and water security are the key challenges of this generation and Aqua Aerem is well-placed to assist with the expected surging demand for reliable, affordable, green energy and provision of security water supplies.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/13/asia-pacific-to-lead-global-battery-storage-market-clock-68-share-by-2026/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,ASIA,CHINA,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"APRIL 13, 2022","Asia Pacific to lead global battery storage market, clock 68% share by 2026","From pv magazine India
The global battery energy storage market will reach $10.84 billion (AU$14.54 billion) in 2026, with the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region accounting for US$7.33 billion (AU$9.83 billion), roughly 68% of the demand. China, Japan, India, South Korea, and Australia will propel the regional APAC market, according to a new report by data and analytics company GlobalData.
Bhavana Sri Pullagura, a senior power analyst at GlobalData, attributes the growth in the battery storage market to a “fall in battery technology prices, increasing need for grid stability and resilience of the integration of renewable power in the power market.” 
China, one of the fastest-growing economies, is expected to lead the global battery energy storage market with a US$4.04 billion (AU$5.42 billion) share in 2026. A mammoth target of 1,200 GW of wind and solar capacity will provide considerable growth opportunities to the energy storage market over the forecast period.

Besides China, South Korea, the US, Germany, and the UK will be the major markets on the back of supportive regulations and incentives.
Other countries will also see a buoyant demand due to the rapid growth in demand for electricity and the wider use of renewable integration. Grid transformations, improving electrification rates, and electricity provisions for the rapidly growing population will create market opportunities, explained Pullagura.
Over the last decade, various new digital and smart technologies have been integrated. Countries have been aggressively promoting grid modernisation and enhancing the grid capability to meet the present and future requirements. Additionally, batteries are being deployed to aid smart grids, integrate renewables, create responsive electricity markets, provide ancillary services, and enhance both system resilience and energy self-sufficiency.
Pullagura concludes: “GlobalData believes that encouraging policies and high electricity charges are also nudging the market to renewables and storage plus renewables at the end consumer level. As the power sector evolves to accommodate new technologies and adapt to varying market trends, energy storage will play a crucial role in the transition and transformation of the power sector.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/13/storing-renewables-in-depleted-oil-and-gas-wells/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 13, 2022",Storing renewables in depleted oil and gas wells,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) are proposing the use of horizontal gas and oil wells to store renewable energy via compressed natural gas.
The scientists initially considered injecting renewable-powered compressed air into old wells, but they chose natural gas because of its compatibility with existing reservoirs.
“We want to start the program with natural gas because it’s easy and I think the people who own the wells, they’d get on board a lot easier,” said NREL researcher David Young. “Eventually, as you prove out the idea, you gradually shift over to a different gas to run the system. CO2 would work. Nitrogen would work. Hydrogen. If you use CO2 that could also be part of a carbon-capture cycle.”
In particular, the US group recommended hydraulically fractured (“fracked”) projects, which account for about 75% of all newly drilled wells in the United States. “The number of active horizontal wells has jumped from about 9,000 in 2,000 to more than a quarter-million in 2017,” said NREL.
The academics evaluated the potential storage of large-scale renewables capacity as compressed natural gas, to be released to spin an electrical generator when electrical demand is high. They described their findings in “Electrical energy storage using compressed gas in depleted hydraulically fractured wells,” which was recently published in iScience. They referred to their technology as “REpurposed FRAcked wells for Energy Storage” (REFRAES).
They proposed the use of unconventional shale and tight sandstone dry gas wells that have been fracked and depleted. Renewable energy could be used to compress natural gas for storage in the wells. The heat generated by the compression process could also be stored for later use.
“The ability to predict and control injection and production of natural gas into and from a shale reservoir through a hydraulically fractured well is one of the most important and challenging aspects of the REFRAES concept,” they emphasised, noting that the shale wells must be able to sustain gas flow rates of several million standard cubic feet per day. “The gas injection occurs near the natural reservoir temperature, pressure, and flow rate, so reservoir deterioration is unlikely.”
The proposed energy storage cycle model is expected to be implemented in four phases: an injection phase, a storage phase, an electricity production phase, and a recovery period. During the recovery period, the well is shut in. The research group assumed that each of these phases would be equal in time duration, although the scheme might not be the most efficient way to cycle the reservoir.
The scientists chose two different configuration for short-term or long-term storage. For the first one, the cycle takes 24 hours to complete, with each phase lasting six hours. For the second option, each phase lasts 90 days and the entire cycle takes 360 days. “These are arbitrary storage cycles chosen for convenience. Actual storage and production durations will be market-driven,” they said.
Through their analysis, the scientists found that these storage facilities may achieve a round-trip storage efficiency of between 40% and 70% depending on the natural reservoir temperature. They said renewables stores in wells may also achieve a levelised cost of storage (LCOS) ranging from US$70 and US$270/MWh, a value which they describe as on par with pumped hydro storage. They also estimated that these facilities may be built at a cost of $1,000 to $3,500 per kilowatt installed.
“The low LCOS values are due to the reuse of existing infrastructure, including a de-risked reservoir, low capital expenditures for additional needed equipment, and utilising the geothermal energy of the reservoir to maintain the thermodynamic state of the compressed gas,” the scientists concluded. “In all, REFRAES is shown to be a viable technology for energy storage with high RTE, low LCOS, and ability to be expanded in scale to meet grid-scale storage needs.”
