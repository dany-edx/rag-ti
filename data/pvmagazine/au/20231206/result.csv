That is, the state installed 26,065 ASHPs in Q3, 2023, up from 5,180 installed in Q3, 2022, the Australian Clean Energy Regulator outlined in its latest Quarterly Carbon Market Report.*
Overall, Australia set a new quarterly record for ASHP installations at 40,000. This brings the total to 101,000 systems installed this year to Q3, already surpassing last year’s annual total of 87,000.*
The Regulator noted this growth is largely thanks to state-based programs in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Capital Territory which incentivise customers to switch. Queensland recently introduced its Climate Smart Energy Savers rebate, with the Regulator saying it expects the program to drive installations in Queensland.
Australia’s rooftop solar segment is not showing any signs of slowing, with Q3 setting a new record of 88,000 systems with a combined capacity of 813 MW installed. “Typically, the highest capacity is installed in Q4 each year,” the Regulator said. “Hence, we may match the 2021 record of 3.2 GW in 2023 if we see a big Q4.”
It also noted the average rooftop system size increased to 9.3 kW. “In Q3 2023, half of the rooftop solar systems installed had a capacity over 10 kW,” the Regulator added. Systems between 10-15 kW accounted for 27% of total installations.
According to the Regulator’s data, 7% of rooftop solar systems were coupled with batteries – though it noted this data is voluntarily reported “and the real proportion is likely higher.”
Even with this limited data, the Regulator said there has been a 14% increase in reported battery installations this year to September compared to the previous year.

Renewable Metals, a startup, just recently completed its battery recycling pilot program in Western Australia demonstrating its innovative processing method, which it says operates at low temperatures and with no sodium sulfate or other chemically precipitated byproducts.

Australia’s battery recycling industry is nascent, and faces a significant hurdle due to the nation’s slow uptake of electric vehicles (EVs), which would be the most obvious feedstock. 
The two companies will embark on a pre-feasibility study outlining indicative project infrastructure and engineering requirements and identifying regulatory approvals and licences necessary for the development, construction, and operation of the project.
If this project were found to be viable, the facility would have an initial planned capacity of 5,000 tonnes per year. It would be Renewable Metals first commercial facility.
Speaking to pv magazine last month, Renewable Metals’ then Acting CEO, Mark Urbani, described the company’s pilot program as “promising.”
Renewable Metals says it has developed an innovative process for lithium-ion battery recycling which can recover up to 95% of the critical minerals from batteries including lithium, nickel, cobalt, copper and manganese. Importantly, the company has also highlighted the lowered environmental impacts of its processes, since battery recycling can result in toxic byproducts and seperate waste streams.
It is aiming to recycle a wide range of lithium-ion battery types, from grid storage batteries to EV modules to battery cells in consumer electronic products such as laptops.
Renewable Metals is one of the only players in Australia’s battery recycling landscape, with fellow Australian recycling upstart, Neometals, now working largely overseas, having set up a plant in Germany. Envirostream, on the other hand, reportedly focuses on turning spent batteries into what is known as “black mass,” essentially shredded batteries.
“We want to develop the first true recycling plant in Australia,” Urbani told pv magazine. “Currently batteries are shredded and sent off overseas.”
Renewable Metals is seeking to build a demonstration plant by end of next year, 2024, which will be semi-commercial and hopefully produce critical mineral products the company can sell. The step after this would be to build a fully commercial plant, like that being examined by AGL.
In April, AGL shuttered its Liddell coal plant in the Hunter Valley. It plans to retire its Bayswater coal power station, situated less than five kilometres away, between 2030 and 2033.
The company is already well underway with plans to connect big batteries at its former coal sites, with a 500 MW/2 GWh battery energy storage system planned for Liddell. 
AGL is also looking to situate other new energy assets at these industrial sites, and in 2022 AGL’s chief operating officer, Markus Brokhof flagged the Hunter Energy Hub would combine grid-scale batteries, solar thermal storage, wind, pumped hydro, and hydrogen.
On the hydrogen front, the company signed an MoU with Fortescue to look into turning Liddell and Bayswater into green hydrogen production centres with up to 2 GW of capacity. Not much seems to have come from that particular venture since then.
“Our current strategy is to transition the Liddell and Bayswater sites into the Hunter Energy Hub, by bringing renewable energy generation and associated industries to those sites,” AGL’s General Manager Energy Hubs, Travis Hughes, said in the Renewable Metals announcement.

New South Wales was once again the country’s top renewable generator at 1,125 GWh, with 682 GWh of that coming from utility solar and 443 GWh from wind, demonstrating the coal-dependent state’s colossal coal turnaround is well underway. 
Most of the country’s best performing solar farms were located there in November, with 13 of the top 20 spots taken out by NSW.
The top performing asset, however, was once again the 100 MW Merredin Solar Farm in Western Australia’s central Wheatbelt region. It had a capacity factor in November of 39.8% (AC). Second place was Neoen’s Griffith solar farm in NSW, with a capacity factor of 35.3% and RWE’s Limondale 2 solar farm at 33.9%.
Dixon also noted that volatility was high across all states except Tasmania and Victoria. The 30-minute intraday spread exceeded $450/MWh in NSW, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia.

Operational demand in Western Australia also reached new highs, exceeding 4 GW, “far outside the historical range,” Dixon added.

Beta Technologies’ ALIA plane has five passenger seats, is 12 metres ling and can fly up to 270 kilometres per hour. It weighs three tonnes and recharging its battery takes between 40 to 60 minutes.

Although the plane has flown than 480 kilometres in test flights, Air New Zealand said it will start off flying routes of around 150 kilometres. These will initially be cargo-only services, with the airline saying it will partner with New Zealand Post to do so.
The eventual aim is to introduce passengers services for the plane. The company says it is aiming to replace its short domestic route services with low-emissions aircraft from 2030.
Air New Zealand has options to buy two more of the ALIA electric planes, with rights reserved on a further 20.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/06/redback-technologies-compliant-for-flexible-exports-to-queensland-grid/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,INVERTERS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",CARRIE HAMPEL,"DECEMBER 6, 2023",Redback Technologies compliant for flexible exports to Queensland grid,"With Redback Technologies inverters now compliant with Queensland’s dynamic connections, homeowners can now use the equipment to export up to 10 kW per phase. Until now, blanket low caps on energy exports to protect the grid from congestion have seen inverters limit the power output to either a battery or the grid to 5 kW.
The removal of these limitations has been made possible because of successful trials in South Australia, showing how rooftop solar systems can be synced with the internet and controlled through a central system to dynamically control the amount exported. In the past, and still in some states, energy exported to the grid is capped at the lowest possible rate, only required in the very rare times that the grid would be overwhelmed with more energy. This has been likened to setting road speed limits at 30 km/h on all roads including highways, instead of regulating speed limits according to the given conditions.
Legislators are now accommodating this ability. The general expectation is that flexible connections will eventually become standard across the country. So far, three Australian states – Queensland, Victoria and the solar trailblazer South Australia – have used dynamic exports to lift caps on how much energy can be fed into the grid.
With dynamic connections, enabled by products such as the first certified products in Queensland from Redback Technologies, Queensland homeowners with single-phase home systems can connect up to 10 kVA of solar and up to 10 kVA of battery energy storage without having to upgrade the connection to three-phase.
With specialised products for dynamic connections, homeowners can export energy at a flexible increased rate without the need for extra hardware. Redback Technologies can now provide Smart Inverters, Smart Hybrid Sytems and Smart 3-Phase Hybrid Systems for dynamic connections, making installation simpler and less expensive.

In South Australia, inverter and battery manufacturer SolarEdge became the first vendor to meet requirements for flexible exports by means of inbuilt software early this year. Now, this is also possible in Queensland with equipment from Redback Technologies.
Dr Adrian Knack, Chief Technology Officer at Redback Technologies, explained: “This can further increase the return on investment on a solar and/or battery system by generating more electricity to export to the grid and storing more energy to use when the solar is not producing.”
The progress of legislation and technology will mean that homeowners are more likely to install larger solar arrays. Previously, solar installers recommended only a 6.6 kW array simply to fit the ideal size for an inverter limited to 5 kW – only because of export limits. The average Australian rooftop can accommodate a 10 kW array, so the prospect of adding a few more panels to earn a bit more on feed-in tariffs will likely see the average home solar array increase in size.
As it stands, households with existing solar arrays in those states now allowing flexible connections will have to upgrade their inverters to make use of lifted caps. Customers with newly installed solar can start with the right equipment from the get-go. In future, homeowners are likely to have to comply with equipping their array for flexible connections.
For those parts of the world currently braving the dark and cold of the Northern Hemisphere, having an excess of solar energy and working out how to flexibly feed it into the grid is almost an inconceivable luxury problem. Australia is forging the path for this kind of progress globally, not only on account of abundant solar energy, and a highly technology-adaptive population, but also because of the kind of suburban sprawl that offers vast areas of rooftops to catch energy in a sunburnt country.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/06/rooftop-solar-is-crushing-the-returns-for-large-scale-vre/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",,"DECEMBER 6, 2023",Rooftop solar is crushing* the returns for large-scale VRE,"Earlier on Tuesday 5th December 2023 we delivered an Executive Briefing to one of our clients with respect to GenInsights Quarterly Updates for 2023 Q3 … after which we publicised more broadly about the release of this report here.
It’s a very broad piece of analysis, and we occasionally choose to share parts of the analysis more broadly with readers on WattClarity.
A few weeks back we noted how the Update for 2023 Q3 was extended further by analysis of Aggregate % VRE on a NEM-wide basis through the quarter … with Mon 3rd and Tue 4th July 2023 rating particular mention (the first part of an evolving Case Study of that important event).
One other thing that jumped out at me with respect to % VRE was contained within the individual unit statistics in Appendix 3 was the extremely low level of VWA Price (for almost all large-scale VRE units) in comparison to the TWA Price for the corresponding region.
Starting with the GSD2019 some years ago now (and soon to be updated for the GSD2023) we included many core metrics for measuring performance of all types of DUIDs across the NEM.  Three of them are worth highlighting here:
1)  The ‘TWA Price’ is the simple time-weighted average price for a given region over a given time period, such as for 2023 Q3:
(a)  which is (by its very nature) not unit-specific,
(b)  but does reflect the final value of a flat futures contract for the same period (so is relevant to each unit in relation to their hedging).
2)  The ‘VWA Price’ is the unit-specific volume-weighted average price seen by that unit for its generation shape
(a)  … but note that this does not take MLF into account
(b)   to enable comparison between units
3)  The ‘VWA Revenue’ takes account of the above, and also the MLF for the unit over that period.
In each Quarterly Update we’ve been collating VWA Prices for all large-scale VRE units.
Referencing 2023 Q3, here’s a comparison of VWA Prices for all Solar Farms sorted by Region and compared to the TWA Price in that particular region:

Specific DUID details are removed in this chart, as that’s not the particular focus (though obviously with your own copy of the report you could see the specifics).  A few things jump out, including:
1)  Every single Large Solar Farm has a VWA price under the TWA Price;
2)  Indeed the vast majority of Large Solar Farms see VWA Prices under half the TWA Price for that region over the same period (2023 Q3);
3)  Furthermore, a number of units in QLD and SA experienced negative VWA Prices through the quarter – which means:
(a)  They would only be above water due to LGC Revenues; and
(b)  That’s even after a level of low price induced curtailment.
(c)  Noting that where exactly the pain on the negative VWA Price lands would depend on hedging structure, which is different for different units.
This analysis is a timely reminder:
1)  That the ‘Solar Correlation Penalty’ is one of the increasing challenges in trying to accelerate this energy transition;
2)  … and also of why Capacity Factor is an increasingly simplistic way to compare solar farm performance!
The situation is not-quite-as-dire (but still not pretty) for Wind Farms across the NEM …

We see:
1)  There’s a couple of wind farms in NSW (and also in QLD) that saw VWA Price above the TWA Price … at least for 2023 Q3:
(a)  The result for QLD was as I was expecting, given how solar-driven is the price shape in the region;
(b)  The result for NSW was a bit more of a surprise
i.  … and one we might delve into later in a specific Case Study that would be added in here
ii.  If we find time to do that, we might actually name those few DUIDs as well!
2)  For many DUIDs, the VWA Price is not under half of the TWA Price
… so different to the situation for Large Solar
3)  But the results for SA and VIC regions still show considerable challenges.
… because the ‘Wind Correlation Penalty’ is so much stronger in those regions.
Readers will note that I see challenges in the way in which we’ve been incentivising the development of ‘Anytime/Anywhere Energy’ in the NEM.
… on top of which there are additional challenges (such as to do with invisibility, forecastability and controllability)  with respect to rooftop PV.
Some share my concerns.
But not everyone.  The All Energy conference was a little over a month ago now – following from which I’ve already shared thoughts about the distinctly different views expressed by various participants at the conference … such as what to do with incentives for small-scale rooftop PV specifically (and DER in more general terms):

So it was with particular interest that I saw this thought here by Warwick Johnston of SunWiz shared on LinkedIn on Monday 4th December 2023:

Note in particular that Jenny was suggesting doubling the eligibility of SRES from 100kW to 200kW … but Warwick above is suggesting going to 1,000kW.
1)  Wow!
2)  If this happened, I would see problems ahead…
A useful segue, to remind readers that we’re now into the last month of 2023, so will shortly be drawing the line on the year-that-was to start the number crunching exercise leading to the release of the Generator Statistical Digest 2023:
1)  Which will contain these types of stats for all* units across the NEM that were operational in the energy market for some period through 2023;
* i.e. ‘all units’ = not just VRE
2)  For an envisaged release in early February 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/06/what-drives-solar-adoption-not-equal-across-income-levels/,"MARKETS,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 6, 2023",What drives solar adoption not equal across income levels,"From pv magazine USA
Solar on a neighbour’s rooftop may influence another neighbor to go solar, especially if the solar is visible and if the neighbour talks about it. However, the level of influence is not even across income levels, as noted in the recent report  by researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, “The role of peer influence in rooftop solar adoption inequity in the United States,” published in Science Direct.
Understanding peer influence in the solar buying decision is important as the solar industry strives to roll out solar to increasing numbers of households. As it is discovered that peer influence is not as strong among low- to middle-income (LMI) households, the solar industry may be better able to adjust its marketing focus and policy makers may consider changes to policies to increase LMI adoption.
As a data source, the researchers used records of over 800,000 U.S. rooftop solar installation records compiled by BuildZoom, an online platform connecting households with service contractors. They then used customer addresses to match the solar records to modeled household-level income estimates generated by Experian and eliminated tracts with daily adoption rates of >10% as extreme outliers or possible data errors.
They found that peer effects are stronger within income groups than across varying groups. But they also found that low-income households are less likely to adopt solar based on peer effects, likely due to the barriers of adoption.
The report identifies the greatest barrier to adoption for LMI households to be budget constraint. The reality is, according to the researchers, that while LMI households may be influenced by peers, they are less likely to adopt.
With solar adoption as a part of U.S. solar policy, for example, through the Justice40 initiative, the results of the report can provide a rationale for seeding programs. This would entail installing solar on LMI rooftops or in LMI areas, hoping that they prime area residents to adopt solar. The researchers suggest that the results provide a further rationale to pair such policies with incentives or access to low-cost financing in order to remove the budget constraint barrier, thus making solar more accessible to all.
