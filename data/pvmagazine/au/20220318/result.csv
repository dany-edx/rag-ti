With diplomatic relations between Australia and China remaining strained and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine escalating, Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday announced $243.6 million would be shared among four major private projects that produce critical minerals or are involved in manufacturing batteries.
“Recent events have underlined that Australia faces its most difficult and dangerous security environment that we have seen in 80 years. The events unfolding in Europe are a reminder of the close relationship between energy security, economic security and national security,” he said.
“These projects are about manufacturing the products and materials Australians need and the world needs, by making them right here at home.”
Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the grants, which fall under the $1.3 billion Modern Manufacturing Initiative, are intended to “supercharge” Australia’s critical minerals sector and open up major export opportunities.
While Australia produces half the world’s lithium, is the second-largest producer of cobalt, and is the fourth-largest producer of rare earths, Taylor made it clear the government is seeking to counter China’s dominance of the global market.

“Australia is lucky to have some of the largest reserves of the critical minerals and metals which drive the modern global economy,” he said.
“But China currently dominates around 70 to 80% of global critical minerals production and continues to consolidate its hold over these supply chains.
“This initiative is designed to address that dominance.”
Among the four projects to receive funding is Brisbane-based Pure Battery Technology (PBT), a University of Queensland spin-out that has developed a greener, cheaper process for refining critical battery materials.
PBT has been granted $119 million to build an integrated nickel manganese cobalt battery material refinery hub in Western Australia (WA).
PBT will work with Poseidon Nickel to build the $399 million precursor Cathode Active Material (pCAM) hub in the Kalgoorlie region. The company is targeting initial production of up to 50,000 tonnes per annum.
PBT chairman Stephen Wilmot said he expects the grant “will accelerate the growth of the battery materials industry in Australia”.
WA-headquartered Australian Vanadium Limited (AVL) is also among the grant recipients, securing $49 million to help it progress its Australian Vanadium Project.
The project includes the processing of high-grade vanadium from AVL’s Meekatharra mine and transporting to its Tenindewa plant which is to be powered by green hydrogen supplied by partner ATCO Australia.

The vanadium will then be transformed into energy-storing batteries to fuel the growing domestic and overseas market.
Perth-based Arafura Resources will receive about $30 million in grants funding to build its Nolans Project rare earth separation plant.
The $90.8 million project, located near Aileron in the Northern Territory, is the first of its kind in Australia and has the potential to supply neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr), a required material for EV magnets.
Sydney-headquartered Alpha HPA will receive $45 million in funding to help finance a new high purity alumina production facility near Gladstone in Queensland.
The company said the $330 million project, being developed in collaboration with Orica, will help meet the rapidly expanding demand for lithium-ion batteries.
“These projects are not only game-changers for the local region with the creation of new jobs, they will also open up incredible export opportunities,” Taylor said.
The Federal Government also this week announced a new Critical Minerals Strategy, backed by a $200 million grants program, to accelerate prospective projects plus $50 million to support research and development.
Resources Minister Keith Pitt said the 2022 Critical Minerals Strategy sets out to grow Australia’s critical minerals sector, expand downstream processing and help meet future global demand.
“The strategy will cement Australia’s position as a leading producer of critical minerals, while contributing to our national security and economic prosperity,” he said.
Pitt said the Accelerator initiative will provide grants to strategically significant critical minerals projects in the early and medium term to help them start production at an early date.

“The Cultana Solar Farm is … gearing up to start construction,” the company said this week in a social media post.
The Cultana project, being developed on an 1100-hectare site north of Whyalla on the Eyre Peninsula, received development approval in mid May 2019. In 2020 the South Australian (SA) government signed a 10-year power purchase agreement with energy retailer ZEN Energy for the supply of renewable energy from the plant.
Construction of the project has however been repeatedly delayed with GFG under a financial microscope in recent years following the collapse of major backer Greensill.
In May last year GFG announced it was looking to find a potential buyer or development partner for the Cultana project, but it now appears the company is pushing ahead with the development.
Simec has in recent weeks advertised a series of roles connected with the construction of the project which would be one of the largest solar farms in the state,

The company said the project site, to the north of GFG’s Whyalla Steelworks, is set to house 780,000 solar panels capable of generating 700GWh of energy per year, enough to power 100,000 homes.
Once construction is complete, the energy generated will contribute to the national electricity grid via the existing Cultana and Whyalla substations.
The project is also expected to play a part in GFG’s plans to modernise the Whyalla Steelworks, which is operated by GFG subsidiary Liberty Primary Metals Australia (L{MA}, by supplying it with low-cost renewable energy.
Although the steelworks will not have a direct behind-the-meter connection to the solar farm, the company has said it will have contracts in place that will effectively utilise the financial hedge that comes out of the solar farm.
Simec’s confirmation that it is preparing to commence construction of the Cultana Solar Farm follows the SA government’s announcement earlier this month it would provide a $50 million grant to co-finance efficiency projects at the Whyalla Steelworks.
LPMA steel executive managing director Jason Schell said the grant will fund approved projects to improve Whyalla’s productivity and efficiency, to be matched on a “dollar for dollar” basis by LPMA.
“The objective of the $50 million grant is to contribute to approved projects that aim to improve the productivity and efficiency of the Whyalla’s Integrated Steelworks,” he said.

Researchers from Spain’s Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) have proposed to store renewable electricity with a pumped thermal energy storage (PTES) system based on supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) as the working fluid and molten salts as the thermal storage fluid.
PTES consists of applying a running thermal cycle to transform low-temperature heat into high-temperature heat and then storing it in a  thermal storage unit during charging. This kind of storage technology allows higher storage efficiencies than the direct electric heating of the thermal storage unit and is claimed to be a promising technique for the management of intermittent renewable energies. Supercritical CO2 is a commercial and industrial fluid state solvent that allows many compounds to be extracted with little damage thanks to the relatively low-temperature process at which it is used.
In the proposed PTES design, supercritical CO2 is utilised as a heat pump and a heat engine. A cycle compressor takes the carbon dioxide during the charging phase and raises its temperature and pressure to the maximum level. The thermal energy generated is then stored in a hot storage unit that lowers the fluid temperature until it reaches the inlet value of a turbine.
“Once the fluid is expanded in the turbine, generating a certain amount of power that will reduce the energy required by the compressor, the fluid temperature is increased using cold thermal storage until reaching the operating inlet temperature of the compressor,” the scientists explained. “The energy in the cold storage system comes from the discharge phase of the cycle. In this process, the cycle works in the opposite direction than explained before.”
During the discharge cycle, the compressed CO2 raises its own temperature using hot storage energy and is then expanded, producing both electrical and mechanical energy for the compressor power requirements, as well as thermal energy that is stored in the cold storage system to be used later during the charging phase. A heat recovery unit was also deployed to reduce the number of heat exchangers, their size, and thermal storage media.
The techno-economical analysis of the systems was performed considering the levelised cost of storage (LCOS) as the key parameter and the best performing configuration was found to achieve an LCOS of €0,116/kWh. “This value places the PTES of this research as one of the most cost-efficient technologies,” the researchers noted. “The best pumped-storage hydroelectricity (PHS) and pumped heat electrical storage (PHES) cases only surpass the mark. The initial cost is much higher for both technologies, and the geographical conditions are particular and rare.”
The system performance was assumed not to decrease after a long sequence of cycles. “The network generated by this novel proposal is 12.46MW in the load and 10MW in the discharge, reaching an efficiency of 80.26%,” the Spanish group emphasised.
The system is described in the paper Electrical energy storage using a supercritical CO2 heat pump, which was recently published in Energy Reports.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/18/investment-cycle-means-race-is-on-to-incentivise-green-hydrogen/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MAX HALL,"MARCH 18, 2022",Investment cycle means race is on to incentivise green hydrogen,"From pv magazine Global
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has stressed the urgency of bringing in policies worldwide to drive the green hydrogen economy by pointing out there is only one investment cycle for heavy industrial plants before mid century.
The latest report published by the international NGO in its green hydrogen series is a guide to policymakers which pointed out 71% of the blast furnaces used in steelmaking around the world require investment this decade, with the remainder requiring attention before 2040.
With chemicals plants enjoying a typical 30-year lifespan, the report added, the average ammonia fab is already 15 years old and the world’s oldest facilities are based in Europe and Asia.
With fossil fuel-powered hydrogen a significant contributor to the heavy carbon footprint of the iron and steel and chemicals industries, Abu Dhabi-based IRENA said policymakers must act immediately to foster green hydrogen before another generation of polluting plants are locked in to, and beyond 2050.
That also means, the Green Hydrogen for Industry report added, the world needs to roll out the huge wave of renewable energy generation facilities needed to power hydrogen electrolysis without eating into the renewables capacity needed to generate electricity for non-industrial uses.
Policies are needed to incentivise heavy industry and end-product consumers, IRENA stated, to help bridge a gap between the current prices of fossil-fuel powered hydrogen, ammonia and alternative transport fuel methanol and their greener counterparts.
The report estimated green hydrogen costs around US$4-6 per kilogram versus US$1-2 for the grey version of the energy carrier. With conventional ammonia costing around US$250-450 per tonne, according to IRENA, a green hydrogen-powered version of the fertiliser feedstock and shipping fuel could be made for US$500-625/t this decade. Methanol costs around US$100-400/t at the moment but the use of green hydrogen, bioenergy and carbon capture and storage to manufacture it would drive that figure to around US$800-1,600, with the expense even higher if untested use of carbon captured directly from the air is factored in.
All of which means policymakers need to roll out the full toolkit of measures to tip the scales in favour of green hydrogen if the world is to have any hope of reaching net zero by mid century, with those heavy industry investment decisions looming.
IRENA’s 68-page study suggests blast furnaces must be phased out and replaced by direct reduced iron (DRI) processes, with quotas introduced stipulating the proportion of hydrogen use which must come from the green version of the gas as well as related minimum purchase requirements for manufacturers further down the chain, such as steel-reliant carmakers.
Emissions trading schemes and direct carbon taxes are further “sticks” which can bring manufacturers to heel, with income from the former supplemented by carbon contracts-for-difference which ensure emissions trading revenues are topped up by government bodies to an agreed strike price level which would decrease over time.
Making it easier for manufacturers to go green by offering access to all sources of grant and funding support in one-stop shops would reduce red tape, the IRNEA document suggested, adding tax systems can be altered to incentivise green industry and that governments should also back R&D.
Bilateral auctions, such as that planned by Germany’s H2Global, would see public intermediaries hold auctions to secure the supply of green hydrogen for the lowest price and then hold procurement exercises to determine the price at which the gas is sold on to industrial consumers, with public funds making up any shortfall initially.
Green procurement by public bodies would also help create demand for green hydrogen and, in an interesting point for the solar industry, IRENA suggested renewable energy procurement auctions could be tweaked to have a requirement to source materials from eco-friendly processes. The study estimated 35 tonnes of glass is needed for a 500MW solar plant, alongside 28 tonnes of steel, 23.5 tonnes of concrete, 9.5 tonnes of aluminium, 3.5 tonnes each of silicon and copper, and three tons of plastic.
The report noted progress is already being made in some quarters, and highlighted the project being planned by Spanish fertiliser company Fertiberia and utility Iberdrola, who plan to establish 800MW of green hydrogen production capacity in four stages to 2027. The first of four plants produced its first green hydrogen in December at a green ammonia plant in Puertollano, Spain and will consist of 100MW of solar generation capacity, a 20MWh lithium-ion battery, and 20MW of electrolyser capacity.
