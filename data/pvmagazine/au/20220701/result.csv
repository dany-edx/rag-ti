As the energy system transitions to net zero, consumer trust and confidence are more important than ever. But trust is earned, not a given.
People have a right to trust they can turn on the lights or the heater when they need to at an affordable price. Equally, people expect that all energy businesses are playing by the rules to provide such an important service.
The Australian Energy Regulator (AER) closely monitors both the wholesale and retail markets to ensure all market participants are complying with the law and the rules, and we act when we uncover misconduct.
Our market monitoring, reporting, compliance and enforcement work continues to be the cornerstone on which we work to build trust with the community.
Compliance with energy laws also ensures that important consumer protections are delivered, and rights are respected. It gives consumers and energy market participants confidence that the energy markets are working effectively and in their long-term interests. It allows them to participate in market opportunities as fully as possible and provides protection when they cannot do so.
This past month has seen a number of Federal Court judgments handed down against market participants for breaching various energy laws in the order of around $29 million.

Just this week, a $17 million penalty, the largest ever imposed on a retailer in response to an action brought by the AER, was handed down for breaches of the energy laws for failing to comply with obligations to protect customers experiencing hardship and payment difficulties.
This penalty also included, for the first-time, conduct that occurred under the new penalty regime introduced to energy laws in January 2021. These reforms recognise the significance of the obligations contained in energy laws to energy security, functioning markets and consumer protection, and provide a significant scaling up of the penalties available to the courts and the AER.
The hardship case outcome eclipsed the previously held record of $12 million from only a few weeks ago for a retailer failing to comply with life support obligations for its customers who rely on life-saving health equipment.
These legal outcomes are examples of the AER’s ongoing willingness to take compliance and enforcement action where there have been serious issues impacting vulnerable consumers or the energy system more broadly. They build on outcomes achieved in 2020–21 where $4.6m in penalties were paid arising from five court proceedings and 48 infringement notices along with $1 million in customer debt waived.
In order to effectively marshal our enforcement and compliance resources, we undertake an annual exercise of identifying enforcement and compliance priorities.
Our 2022–23 compliance and enforcement priorities released today, reflect the importance of well-functioning markets and protections for consumers in vulnerable circumstances – both areas now more important than ever given the current circumstances.
Our key compliance and enforcement priority areas focus on effective identification of consumers in financial difficulty, and ensuring registered generators comply with offers, dispatch instructions, bidding rules, and provide accurate and timely information to our market operator.
In addition, improving outcomes for consumers in embedded networks (apartment blocks, caravan parks and retirement villages, commercial buildings, shopping centres), and the timely and accurate disclosure of gas information to ensure rigor and competition in all aspects of the energy market is vital to the availability and affordability of energy for households and businesses.
Laws passed last week will also provide the AER with greater powers to monitor wholesale gas markets, specifically ensuring shorter-term gas markets are operating competitively.
We expect these new laws and penalties will provide a greater incentive for businesses to comply with the rules designed to protect energy consumers.
As we continue the transformation of the energy system, it is more important than ever that energy businesses understand their obligations and that these are widely complied with in spirit and to the letter.
The AER will continue to focus on enforcing compliance with the energy laws and rules in the wholesale and retail sectors and take appropriate action in response when required. We are carefully considering the recent market events and their drivers and will take necessary action in relation to breaches of the law and rules identified.
It is not only what governments, industry and the community expect, but what they deserve.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/01/stanwell-plans-2-9-gwh-big-battery-next-to-coal-unit/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 1, 2022",Stanwell plans 2.9 GWh big battery next to coal unit,"State government-owned energy company Stanwell is progressing plans to develop a large-scale standalone battery with a combined 1.45 GW/2.9 GWh of energy storage adjacent to its coal-fired Stanwell Power Station near Rockhampton in central Queensland. Stanwell said the battery would support ongoing investment in renewables and help maintain system security and reliability.
A material change of use application has been lodged with Rockhampton Regional Council on behalf of Stanwell, which owns and operates the Stanwell and Tarong coal-fired power stations, for a new utility-scale battery energy storage system (BESS).
According to the planning report, the BESS would be installed on a 12-hectare site near the Stanwell Power Station and would be built in two stages. Stage one would involve the installation of lithium-ion batteries with an output of 150 MW/300 MWh while stage two may use lithium-ion or flow battery technology with an output of up to 1,300 MW/2,600 MWh.
Stanwell, which is also progressing plans to develop a 150 MW/300 MWh battery adjacent to the Tarong Power Station site near Nanango in the South Burnett, said it is seeking to develop a high-quality, cost-effective portfolio of renewable energy and energy storage assets to support its long-term strategy of providing low-emissions solutions to commercial and industrial retail customers.
“As a business, we are investigating a range of future energy solutions to ensure we are in the best position possible to respond to the changing market,” the company said. “We are investigating a range of opportunities to incorporate technologies into our asset portfolio, including hydrogen, energy storage, wind, solar and bioenergy.”
The government-owned generator said large-scale BESS will play an increasingly important role in the National Electricity Market (NEM) as it moves to a predominantly renewable-based energy system.
“Energy storage will be critical as it helps facilitate the integration of renewable energy into the energy system by storing electricity generated by wind and solar and supplying it to the market when required,” it said.

The first stage of the Stanwell battery would incorporate lithium-ion technology.The report, lodged by Brisbane-based design and engineering company Aurecon, indicates the Stanwell battery will be capable of storing electrical energy from, and exporting to, the NEM.
“The project will store electricity during periods of high supply and or low usage and provide electricity during critical peak times allowing for reliable and affordable energy supply during these periods,” the report says.
The BESS will also provide Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) services to the NEM, helping ensure energy supply and demand are matched at all times.
“By acting as a load during the peak solar generation periods and providing energy services that support system stability, the BESS will support the deployment of renewable energy power generation in the NEM,” the report says.
The Stanwell battery is to be built on a site adjacent to the Stanwell power plant, about 28 kilometres southwest of Rockhampton. Stanwell said locating battery storage at the site would allow it to capitalise on existing land and connection infrastructure with the proposed BESS to connect to Queensland network operator Powerlink’s adjoining switchyard via a 275 kV transmission line.

While no timeline for the project was detailed in the planning report, Stanwell has previously indicated to would likely be brought online in 2024, although the report acknowledges the project remains subject to approvals.
The news of the Stanwell big battery comes just days after fellow government-owned generator CS Energy announced plans to build a 200 MW/400 MWh at Greenbank in Brisbane’s outer southern suburbs.
The project, to be delivered in partnership with Powerlink, is part of a ‘battery blitz’ announced by the state government as it looks to grow Queensland’s energy storage capacity.
The government last week said it would be rolling out 13 large-scale batteries across the state as part of progress towards achieving its 50% renewable energy target by 2030.
Earlier this week the government announced the latest addition to its battery projects with an 8 MWh energy storage system to be installed in Cairns.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the increased number of batteries would allow for better management of the ever-increasing levels of renewable energy being generated.
“Large-scale batteries like the one now planned for Cairns allow us to capture the energy generated by Queenslanders, and best use it for Queenslanders,” he said.
“By basing the batteries at a substation in the community, it means renewable energy will be generated locally, stored locally, and then used locally, reducing the pressure on the upstream transmission network.”

The spodumene concentrate, a critical mineral used in the production of lithium-ion batteries, will come from Liontown’s 100%-owned Kathleen Valley Lithium Project being developed near Leinster, about 680 kilometres north-east of Perth.
It is the third offtake agreement Liontown has struck after signing similar deals with US-based electric vehicle and battery manufacturer Tesla and South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution. Liontown said it had now signed binding offtake agreements for 450,000tpa of spodumene concentrate, representing 90% of the project’s initial planned production.
As part of the latest deal, Ford will also provide Liontown with a $300 million debt facility to underpin the development of the lithium mine. The Perth-based miner said the car manufacturer’s facility along with proceeds from a $463 million capital raise completed last year provide sufficient capital for Liontown to make the FID to develop the estimated $545 million project.

Liontown managing director and chief executive officer Tony Ottaviano said the FID is a represents a major landmark for the project’s development.
“The signing of our third and final foundational offtake agreement is a momentous milestone for Liontown and the Kathleen Valley project, with approximately 90% of Kathleen Valley’s start-up capacity now under secured long-term binding offtake agreements,” he said.
“In addition to the offtake, the $300 million funding facility from Ford, together with the capital raised last year, means that we have secured commitments for the funds required to support the full commercial development of Kathleen Valley through to first production.”
Ford’s vice president of EV industrialisation, Lisa Drake, said the Kathleen Valley agreement is a significant deal for the car maker which plans to invest more than $US50 billion globally through 2026 to develop EVs and the batteries that power them.
“Ford continues working to source more deeply into the battery supply chain to meet our goals of delivering more than 2 million EVs annually for our customers by 2026,” she said. “This is one of several agreements we’re working on to help us secure raw materials to support our plan to deliver EVs for customers around the world and meet our environmental, social, and governance commitments.”
The Kathleen Valley project is expected to initially produce about 500,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate per annum, but Liontown hopes to expand production to 700,000 tonnes in 2029.

The company said early grade control drilling is well advanced at the planned two open pits with major construction work at the mine expected to start toward the end of the year. Mining is expected to commence in Q1 2023 with first production of spodumene concentrate from Q2 2024.
Liontown said it had already placed orders for nearly three-quarters of the equipment needed for the processing plant while work has also progressed across the construction scope and procurement is advancing for the remaining project activities in line with the development plan.
“We do not intend to stand still,” Ottaviano said, adding the company is determined to deliver the project as quickly as possible.
“This process begins by immediately securing high-calibre contractors and business partners to ensure we can deliver the Project safely and efficiently. We remain on track to deliver first spodumene concentrate by Q2 2024.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/01/australian-researchers-reveal-improvements-for-solar-window-technology/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 1, 2022",Australian researchers reveal improvements for solar window technology,"The development of semi-transparent solar cells that can transform windows into active power generators continues to progress with a team of Australian researchers producing next-generation perovskite cells with a conversion efficiency of 15.5% that increase the stability of ‘solar windows’ while allowing more natural light to pass through.
The researchers, based at Victoria’s Monash University and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), had previously developed semi-transparent perovskite solar cells (ST-PeSCs) that allowed 10% of visible light to pass through, while simultaneously achieving a 17% power conversion efficiency. Non-transparent silicon rooftop cells operate at about 20% efficiency.
The same team, led by Professor Jacek Jasieniak from Monash University’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering, has now developed new formulations of cells using a combination of caesium and formamidinium in the initial perovskite composition that have increased the stability of the ST-PeSCs while allowing more visible light to pass through.
Using this perovskite composition, power conversion efficiencies of 15.5% and 4.1% have been achieved for different prototype cells with average visible transmittance of 20.7% and 52.4% respectively.
While the power conversion rates are lower than previous results, Jasieniak said the amount of visible light being passing through the cells is now approaching levels suited to glazing, increasing their potential to be used in a wide range of real-world applications.

“This work provides a major step forward towards realizing high efficiency and stable perovskite devices that can be deployed as solar windows to fulfill what is a largely untapped market opportunity,” he said.
The researchers, members of the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science, said besides improvements in device performance and transparency, the caesium and formamidinium ST-PeSCs had also demonstrated excellent long-term stability when tested under continuous illumination and heating, which mimics the conditions the devices would encounter in real-world use.
The research results, published in the Advanced Science journal, show the caesium and formamidinium based ST-PeSCs maintained 85% of their initial power conversion efficiency after 1,000 hours under continuous illumination, making them attractive candidates for scalable device manufacturing.
While the use of solar glazing in real life applications is in its infancy, it is increasingly being considered by developers.
Victorian architecture firm Kennon recently announced plans to clad an eight-storey building being constructed in West Melbourne with a “solar skin” that will generate almost all of the building’s base power while West Australian smart solar glass developer ClearVue has inked a deal to complete its first commercial installation in the United States.

ClearVue announced earlier this month it had signed a letter of intent with private investment company LabReal to install its transparent solar glass technology at an office building being constructed in Atlanta, Georgia.
The project will use 250 square metres of ClearVue PV glazing. The project is in the final stages of planning, with construction expected to start during the fourth quarter of 2022.
ClearVue executive chairman Victor Rosenberg said the project is the company’s first commercial installation in North America and will serve as a reference site for securing larger sales in the region.
“The ClearVue technology represents a paradigm shift in the way glass will be used in building construction,” he said.
“Glass will no longer be just a component of construction, but also a renewable energy source and a key element in construction decarbonisation efforts – both for refurbishments and for new builds.
“The Atlanta project will demonstrate this and provide a key reference site for the company in this target territory.”

The new loans facility builds upon the two company’s existing relationship which aims to make the selling of solar more streamlined for retailers and installers while eliminating some of the hurdles confronting consumers looking to purchase solar and batter energy storage systems.
The companies said solar installers can now offer clients access to Plenti zero-interest payment plans directly in the proposals they send to customers. The new all-in-one proposal means customers can accurately visualise their homes with solar, together with zero-interest finance options.
“Solar installers benefit by providing an effortless purchasing experience for their customers, including automatic conditional approvals within two minutes of the customer’s application,” the companies said in a statement.
OpenSolar’s head of partnerships, Maaike Gobel, said the new loans facility would further enhance the utility of the online platform for industry operators.
“What’s great about this latest innovation from Plenti is that the customers can see really flexible finance options that can get approved on the spot, getting more solar out there in less time,” she said.
Plenti’s head of renewable energy finance head Louis Edwards said the company’s aim is to provide the best in flexible payment terms for solar customers.
“This new style of finance integration with OpenSolar means that solar installers can increase their sales conversion whilst also being able to rely on steady and timely income for their growing businesses,” he said.

Since launching in May 2019, OpenSolar’s digital toolkit for generating installer-branded quotes that detail solar system size, optimal orientation and design, and savings on current bills, has attracted more than 100,000 industry users. The software allows installers to generate quotes, supported with visuals, from a smartphone, tablet or internet-connected laptop.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/01/glass-pyramid-concentrator-for-solar-cell-applications/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 1, 2022",Glass pyramid concentrator for solar cell applications,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at Stanford University have created a glass pyramid optical concentrator that concentrates light on solar cells, regardless of the light incidence angle.
“It’s a completely passive system – it doesn’t need energy to track the source or have any moving parts,” said research coordinator Nina Vaidya. “Without optical focus that moves positions or need for tracking systems, concentrating light becomes much simpler.”
The AGILE (Axially Graded Index LEns) device purportedly harvests more than 90% of the light that hits its surface. It also creates spots at the output that are three times brighter than the incoming light.
“Installed in a layer on top of solar cells, they could make solar arrays more efficient and capture not only direct sunlight, but also diffuse light that has been scattered by the Earth’s atmosphere, weather, and seasons,” the scientists explained, noting that the solar cell could be built with fewer raw materials and at lower costs.
They said a top layer of the concentrator could be used to replace existing encapsulation materials. That would in turn create space for cooling and circuitry to run between the narrowing pyramids of the individual devices. The pyramid was made of different optical glass flats provided by Japan’s Ohara Corp.
“The geometry of the pyramid was a square of side 14.5 mm down to a square of 8.5 mm giving a concentration of three, along a total height of 8 mm with 8 glass layers, with each flat 1 mm thick,” the academics said.
They layered the glass together with polymers that bend light to different degrees. “The layers change the light’s direction in steps instead of a smooth curve,” they said. “The sides of the prototypes are mirrored, so any light going in the wrong direction is bounced back towards the output.”
The prototype can improve optical concentration by a factor of three and achieve a 90% efficiency in capturing light, they claimed in “Immersion graded index optics: theory, design, and prototypes, which was recently published in Microsystems and Nanoengineering.
“Results of the functional prototypes demonstrate that immersion graded index technology can improve the way we concentrate and couple light many fold,” the scientists said. “The AGILE has the potential to greatly improve opto-electronic systems by reducing cost, increasing efficiency, providing a scalable concentration system with built-in anti-reflection and encapsulation without the need for tracking.”
