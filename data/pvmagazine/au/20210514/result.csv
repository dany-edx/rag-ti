Instead, it’s a flight of fancy","From The Conversation
Looking at other nations around the world, the path to cutting greenhouse gas emissions seems clear.
First, develop wind and solar energy and battery storage to replace coal- and gas-fired electricity. Then, replace petrol and diesel cars with electric vehicles running off carbon-free sources. Finally, replace traditionally made steel, cement and other industries with low-carbon alternatives.
In this global context, the climate policies announced in Tuesday’s federal budget are a long-odds bet on a radically different approach. In place of the approaches adopted elsewhere, the Morrison government is betting heavily on alternatives that have failed previous tests, such as carbon capture and storage. And it’s blatantly ignoring internationally proven technology, such as electric vehicles.
The government could have followed the lead of our international peers and backed Australia’s clean energy sector to create jobs and stimulate the post-pandemic economy. Instead, it’s sending the nation on a fool’s errand.
The Morrison government is taking a “technology, not taxes” approach to emissions reduction. Rather than adopt a policy such as a carbon price – broadly considered the most effective and efficient way to cut emissions – the government has instead pinned its hopes on a low-emissions technology plan.
That means increased public spending on research and development, to accelerate the commercialisation of low emissions technologies. The problems with this approach are most obvious in relation to carbon capture and storage (CCS).
The budget contains A$263.7 million to fund new carbon capture and storage projects. This technology promises to capture some – but to date, not all – carbon dioxide at the point of emission, and then inject it underground. It would allow continued fossil fuel use with fewer emissions, but the process is complex and expensive.
In fact, recent research found of 39 carbon-capture projects examined in the United States, more than 80% ended in failure.
The government’s CCS funding is focused on capturing CO₂ from gas projects. This is despite the disappointing experience of Australia’s only CCS project so far, Chevron’s Gorgon gas field off Western Australia.
Some 80% of emissions from the operation were meant to be captured from 2016. But the process was delayed for three years, allowing millions of tonnes of CO₂ to enter the atmosphere. As of January this year, the project was still facing technical issues.
CCS from gas will be expensive even if it can be made to work. Santos, which has proposed a CCS project at its Moomba gas plant in South Australia, suggests a cost of $A30 per tonne of CO₂ captured.
This money would need to come from the government’s Climate Solutions Fund, currently allocated about A$2 billion over four years. If Moomba’s projected emissions reduction of 20 million tonnes a year were realised, this project alone would exhaust the fund.
There is a striking contrast between the Morrison government’s enthusiasm for carbon capture, and its neglect of electric vehicles.
It ought to be obvious that if Australia is to achieve a target of net-zero emissions by 2050 – which Treasurer Josh Frydenberg this week reiterated was his government’s preference – the road transport sector must be decarbonised by then.
The average age of Australian cars is about 10 years. This implies, given fairly steady sales, an average lifespan of 20 years. This in turn implies most petrol or diesel vehicles sold after 2030 will have to be taken off the road before the end of their useful life.
In any case, such vehicles will probably be very difficult to buy within 15 years. Manufacturers including General Motors and Volvo have announced plans to stop selling petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 or earlier.
But the Morrison government has ruled out consumer incentives to encourage electric vehicle uptake – a policy at odds with many other nations, including the US.
Despite the “technology, not taxes” mantra, this week’s federal budget ignored electric vehicles. This includes a A$10 billion infrastructure spend which did not include charging stations as part of highway upgrades.
Unless the government takes action soon, Australian motorists will be faced with the choice between a limited range of second-rate petrol and diesel vehicles, or electric vehicles for which key infrastructure is missing.
It’s hard to work out why the government is so resistant to doing anything to help electric vehicles. Public support appears strong. There are no domestic carmakers left to protect.
The car retail industry is generally unenthusiastic about electric vehicles. Its business model is built on combining competitive sticker prices with a high-margin service and repair business, and electric vehicles don’t fit this model.
At the moment (although not for much longer), electric vehicles are more expensive than traditional cars to buy upfront. But they are cheaper to run and service.
There are fears of job losses in car maintenance as electric vehicle uptake increases. However, car dealers have adjusted to change in the past, and can do so in future.
The Morrison government is still edging towards announcing a 2050 net-zero target in time for the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow this November. But as Prime Minister Scott Morrison himself has emphasised, there’s no point having a target without a strategy to get there.
Yet at this stage, the government’ emissions reduction strategy looks more like wishful thinking than a road map.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/14/australia-can-be-renewable-energy-superpower-says-albanese/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 14, 2021",Australia can be ‘renewable energy superpower’ says Albanese,"Speaking in Parliament on Thursday night, Albanese used his reply to the 2021-2022 Federal Budget to showcase the $100 million plan which would see 10,000 apprenticeships in green energy generation, storage, and related activities partly funded by $10,000 grants over four years.
“The world is moving quickly to embrace new energy sources. Australia can be at the forefront of this change,” Albanese said.
“Not long ago solar power was seen as a useful novelty, good enough to run a pocket calculator but too expensive, too inefficient, too unreliable to power a home or a workplace.
“Australians changed that. Australian breakthroughs in solar power reshaped the global energy grid.
“Overwhelmingly this did lead to manufacturing and job creation, but it was overseas, not here. And if we don’t get smart, if we don’t get serious, if we don’t get moving, the same thing will happen again.”
Critics have savaged the Federal Government following the unveiling of its 2021-22 Budget on Tuesday night, claiming the lack of money set aside for renewable energy is a missed opportunity.
More than $1.6 billion has been allocated in the Budget for energy and emission reduction spending but there is just $49.3 million for green energy, including $30 million over the next year for the Darwin big battery and a microgrid project in the Northern Territory and $19.3 million for another microgrid project in the northern Queensland.

Most of the government’s spending on energy is focused on low emissions technologies, including $275 million for the development of four hydrogen production hubs, and $237 million for carbon capture and storage projects (CCS) and hubs but these are not explicitly green projects.
The Government, which has declared that Australia is on the pathway to net zero and that their goal is to get there preferably by 2050, continues to focus on a gas-fired future.
“Their insistence on looking backwards on energy … has driven our capability downwards but our cost upwards,” Albanese said.
“They’ve run up the white flag on skills and apprentices. I’m not going to see us surrender any more jobs and industries.
“We mine and produce every element needed to build a lithium battery – the power storage technology of the future.
“I don’t want us to miss out on jobs and investment by sending those materials overseas for another country to manufacture and then importing them back once value has been added.”
Labor’s apprenticeship plan would offer $10,000 cash payments to support 10,000 energy apprenticeships. The apprenticeships will be available in rooftop solar installation and maintenance; renewable energy generation; storage and distribution including in emerging technologies such as green hydrogen; energy efficiency upgrades; renewables manufacturing like batteries; and relevant agricultural activities.
The $10,000 would be split over the four years, with $2,000 paid upon the apprenticeship’s start and the remaining money paid out at $2,000 per year.

Albanese also announced plans to invest $10 million in training and education programs for experienced workers seeking to re-train or upskill in new energy industries, claiming Labor’s approach “will make electric cars more affordable and support the rollout of community batteries”.
Clean Energy Council chief executive Kane Thornton welcomed Albanese’s plan, saying it paints a vision for Australia’s future with renewable energy a driving force of a thriving economy.
“The Federal Australian Labor Party (ALP) should be congratulated for recognising the opportunities that the renewable energy sector presents and committing to a range of sensible and bold initiatives,” he said.
“Now is the time to unlock Australia’s enormous renewable energy potential.
“The current pipeline of renewable energy projects could secure nearly 29,000 full-time equivalent jobs. Our sector is ready to deliver career pathways that provide access to clean, low-cost energy, which the future workforce can truly aspire to.
“Renewable energy jobs can have an enormous positive impact on regional communities, and this should be a clear priority for government.”
Thornton also welcomed the ALP’s plan to roll out community batteries, taking advantage of Australia’s love of rooftop solar.
“When every suburb has a community battery, Australia’s electricity system will be fairer, cleaner, cheaper, more reliable and more neighbourly,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/14/adelaide-to-deliver-australias-first-100-electric-hospital/,"SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 14, 2021",Adelaide to deliver Australia’s first 100% electric hospital,"The South Australian Government has confirmed the new Women’s and Children’s Hospital being built in Adelaide will be connected to an electricity source that is powered by the state’s increasingly renewables-dominated electricity grid or through on-site electricity generation and storage, rather than the state’s gas infrastructure.
Minister for Health and Wellbeing Stephen Wade said the new all-electric hospital, to be co-located with the Royal Adelaide Hospital in Adelaide’s inner south, will be the most sustainable major public hospital in Australia and would help deliver an emissions-free health sector for South Australia.
“We have a responsibility to reduce the carbon footprint of the healthcare sector,” he said.
“The new Women’s and Children’s Hospital (nWCH) will operate for decades to come and will have a higher energy demand, in line with modern, technically advanced facilities. It would be negligent if we didn’t consider the impact of that increased demand on the environment and future generations.”
The electrification of the hospital will eliminate fossil fuel use on site with electrical energy systems to power the building’s engineering services, including heating, hot water and kitchen functions.
The purpose-built facility will be the first hospital in Australia to be 100% electrified. An expansion of the current Canberra Hospital in the Australian Capital Territory will also be all-electric, but the existing part of the facility will remain with gas power in the energy source mix.

It is estimated the electrification of the nWCH will help avoid an additional 2,178 tonnes of greenhouse emissions each year, the equivalent of taking approximately 700 vehicles off the road.
Energy Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan said the project aligns with the South Australian Government’s commitment to a 100% renewable electricity grid by 2030, a target well within reach with renewables providing 60% of the state’s electricity supply in 2020.
“This will not only improve operating costs for the life of the hospital but will ensure South Australia will continue to lead the country in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprint,” he said.
“By investing in renewables, we are reducing South Australia’s emissions footprint, with well over half of the state’s electricity now being produced by wind and solar energy projects.
“The South Australian electricity grid is one of the cleanest in the country – using the highest amount of variable renewable energy from sun and wind of any state.”
Early works have already commenced on the nCWH which is currently scheduled for completion in 2025-26. The State Government has so far committed $685 million to the project with the final cost to be determined as part of the State Budget process.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/14/lightsource-bp-gets-approval-for-600mw-nsw-solar-energy-hub/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 14, 2021",Lightsource bp gets approval for 600MW NSW solar energy hub,"The solar arm of oil major BP, Lightsource bp, announced on Thursday it had received approval from the NSW Department of Planning and Environment for its 400 MWdc (350 MWac) Wellington North Solar Farm, which will be built next to the 200 MWdc (174 MWac) Wellington Solar Farm which is currently under construction.
The Wellington North project, which was acquired from AGL last year, will be constructed on a 970-hectare site approximately seven kilometres north-east of Wellington, near Dubbo in the state’s central west.
“We are very excited about the planning approval of our Wellington North Solar Farm, this is an important step forward in our ambition to help Australia transition to a lower carbon future,” Lightsource bp Australia country manager Adam Pegg said.
“In a few years our 600 MWdc Wellington solar hub will be producing 1,173,000 MWh of renewable electricity, the equivalent to powering 170,000 Australian homes, saving 938,000 carbon emissions annually.”
The project will use 1.2 million bifacial solar modules and will link to the grid via a 330 kV transmission line connected to Transgrid’s Wellington Substation. The development approval ruled out the installation of a battery storage facility or system but the department said there was nothing preventing Lightsource bp from seeking to modify this consent to install a battery storage facility in the future.
The company has indicated construction of the solar farm is due to begin soon with the project expected to generate 400 jobs.
Since partnering with bp in 2017 and entering the market in 2018, Lightsource bp has developed a significant pipeline of large-scale solar projects across Australia and Wellington North is the latest addition to the portfolio.
The company, which has commissioned 1.3 GW of solar capacity and manages approximately 2 GW of capacity under long-term operations and maintenance contracts globally, expects to commence construction of its 107 MWdc West Wyalong Solar Farm in NSW and the 210 MWdc (176 MWac) Woolooga Solar Farm in Queensland later this year.

The 200 MWdc Wellington Solar Farm is close to completion and when operational, the plant will produce approximately 435,000 MWh of clean electricity a year. Most of the project output has already been contracted by Snowy Hydro via a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA).
Together, the Australian portfolio exceeds more than 900 MWdc and once operational, will make Lightsource bp one of the largest solar owners and operators in Australia.
Frédéric Baudry, the president of bp Australia, said the projects form part of the company’s transition from an international oil company to an integrated energy company.
“We are proud to be progressing strong positions in renewables and contributing to Australia’s, and bp’s, net zero by 2050 ambitions,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/14/hydrogen-as-a-universal-climate-solution-might-be-a-bit-of-false-promise/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,GERMANY,SWITZERLAND,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 14, 2021",‘Hydrogen as a universal climate solution might be a bit of false promise’,"From pv magazine Global
Hydrogen, and electrofuels (e-fuels) produced with hydrogen are currently raising high expectations as a form of energy that could pervade all sectors, including mobility and heating. However, they will likely not be able to fully decarbonise the global economy, due to lack of capacity and too-high prices.
This conclusion was drawn in research conducted by scientists from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, in Germany, and the Paul Scherrer Institute, in Switzerland, in which they stated that the use of hydrogen-based fuels should be prioritised in sectors that are difficult to electrify, such as long-distance aviation, feedstocks in chemical production, steel production and high-temperature industrial processes.
The scientists cite short-term scarcity and long-term uncertainty as a major obstacle for hydrogen to reach sectors that are easier to electrify, such as transport and heating, although hydrogen fuels will probably not be completely excluded from applications of this kind. “There will likely be small-scale niche applications and also regional-specific responses to this question,” researcher Falko Ueckerdt told pv magazine.
“If we use hydrogen-based fuels instead of direct electrification alternatives, two to 14 times the amount of electricity generation is needed, depending on the application and the respective technologies,” explained research co-author Romain Sacchi. “Efficiency losses happen both on the supply side, in the production process of the hydrogen-based fuels, and on the demand side – a combustion engine wastes a lot more energy than an electrical one.”
The academics defined the current race for green or blue hydrogen and e-fuels as a “potential distraction” from the task of electrifying the global economy, which they claim is more urgent as well as cheaper and easier to achieve. E-fuel costs, on the other hand, may become competitive only if carbon prices will rise significantly before the end of this decade – a scenario that the German-Swiss group described as rather unlikely.
“Even if assuming 100% renewable electricity, the costs of avoiding one ton of CO2 emissions by using hydrogen-based fuels would currently be €800 for liquid and €1,200 for gaseous fuels,” the research team explained. “This is much higher than current CO2 prices, for instance in the European Emissions Trading Scheme, which currently are below €50 per ton.”
According to its calculations, hydrogen-based fuels may be cost-competitive, eventually, by 2040, but this would be too late for relying on hydrogen as a climate solution. Direct electrification alternatives already exist, it further explained, and these must be applied if climate change needs to be tackled.
Considering that carbon prices may need more than a decade to reach sufficient levels to better support a hydrogen economy, public policies will be necessary to support research and the market introduction of hydrogen-based fuels, the researchers went on to say. Government strategies should support innovation and initial scale-up, including direct electrification and enacting energy tax reforms to create a level-playing field for all technologies.
“Fuels based on hydrogen as a universal climate solution might be a bit of false promise,” Ueckerdt concluded. “While they’re wonderfully versatile, it should not be expected that they broadly replace fossil fuels.”
The paper Potential and risks of hydrogen-based e-fuels in climate change mitigation was recently published in Nature Climate Change.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/14/rooftop-cpv-thermal-tech-to-produce-electricity-and-freshwater/,"COMMUNITY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,SAUDI ARABIA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 14, 2021",Rooftop CPV-thermal tech to produce electricity and freshwater,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia and the Donghua University in China have designed a decentralised cogeneration solution for the production of power and freshwater that combines concentrated photovoltaics and solar thermal collectors with a vacuum multi-effect membrane distillation (VMEMD) system. It is based on a thermal separation process with microporous hydrophobic membranes and can reportedly concentrate liquids with high salt concentrations close to saturation.
“The system was so far developed at the laboratory level,” KAUST researcher Qian Chen told pv magazine. “We have completed the study on CPVT and the VMEMD modules and now are working on system integration.”
The proposed system was assembled with several concentrated photovoltaic/thermal (CPV-T) collectors, a hot water tank, a V-MEMD module, a seawater feed tank, and a distillate tank.
The electricity produced by the CPV-T installation is supplied to potential final users while the generated heat is used to produce hot water to power the V-MEMD system. In the latter, the seawater supplied from the feed tank partially evaporates, and the produced vapour is then condensed. In the following step, the condensation heat is reused to heat the seawater and further induce evaporation. “The process is repeated several times in the subsequent effects, and vapour produced in the last effect is condensed in an external condenser,” the researchers explained, adding that polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes are utilised at the evaporation interface to separate water and vapour. The water is then stored in the distillate tank.
The CPV-T system is comprised of Fresnel lenses, glass homogenisers, triple-junction solar cells based on indium gallium phosphide (InGaP), indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) and germanium (Ge), a heat sink for cooling, and a two-axis solar tracker. “The solar cells convert a portion of the solar radiation into electricity, while the remaining radiation is dissipated as heat,” the academics said. “Coolant is circulated below the cells to absorb the generated heat, which not only lowers the cell temperature and improves the cell efficiency but also recovers the heat for desalination application.”
The solar system showed a power conversion efficiency of 25% and a thermal efficiency of 45% during an entire year. “The energy efficiency of the system is dominated by electricity generation, and its value is stabilised at 25-27% under different design and operating conditions,” Chen told pv magazine. “The levelised cost for desalinated water is $0.7-4.3/m3, depending on PV cost and electricity price.”
The system is described in the paper A decentralised water/electricity cogeneration system integrating concentrated photovoltaic/thermal collectors and vacuum multi-effect membrane distillation, published in Energy.
