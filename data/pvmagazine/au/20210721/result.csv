They are, of course, technically correct – biomass is defined as a renewable energy source both here in Australia and abroad. Trees grow back. When they grow, they reabsorb the carbon they emit if they’re burned. In theory, it’s tidy closed loop system and has earned biomass the label net zero.
In reality though, niggling questions persist. This neat piece of carbon accounting, for instance, pays little attention to time. When, exactly, do we reach carbon parity? And to what extent can we trust claims about the wood’s origin and sustainability credentials?
As for using biomass to make what will go on to be sold as green hydrogen, Suzanne Harter, a Clean Energy Campaigner at the Australian Conservation Fund described it to pv magazine Australia as “a bit like money laundering.” 
Two key features make biomass attractive as an energy source. Firstly, it takes very little to convert an existing thermal power plant from coal burning to wood burning. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly for the hydrogen industry, it provides predicable, base load power.
Solar and wind, as abundant as they are here in Australia, remain at the whim of nature. And electrolysers, which are used to make green hydrogen, are extremely expensive. So there’s a good chance that those operating them would prefer if they worked around the clock, rather than just when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing.
“The most reliable form of green energy is waste biomass,” Richard Poole, CEO and Director of Verdant Earth Technologies, told pv magazine Australia.
Verdant recently bought the mothballed Redbank Power Station in the New South Wales’ Hunter region. It plans to recommission the 151 MW station, now called Verdant Power Station, to run purely on waste biomass.
“So we end up with a green energy product [by burning biomass],” Poole explained, “and what we want to do with that green energy product is add green hydrogen behind it.” That is, Verdant’s plan is to co-locate a hydrogen production facility next to the power plant, eliminating transmission costs and maximising production, alongside feeding the biomass-generated electricity directly into the grid. Its aim is to be producing hydrogen at the site by December, 2022.
Verdant isn’t the only company pursuing this model, Patriot Hydrogen is also putting biomass at the centre of its hydrogen producing plans, though at a much smaller scale. Its P2H units, as they’re named, are essentially modular, hydrogen producing kits which run on biomass, with the company boasting they can be powered up anywhere, anytime.
The biomass Verdant plans to burn at its power station will come from local sawmill, Sweetman Renewables. The company’s chairman, John Halkett, told pv magazine Australia he is looking to double if not treble log input for the sawmill, growing the facility’s production by the same amount. Halkett described demand for hardwood as “gangbusters,” noting that the Victorian government are currently moving to ban the native hardwood industry, giving companies like Sweetman, which is based in New South Wales, an even bigger share of the growing market.
Both Poole and Halkett are eager to clarify that the wood being burned is waste. “We don’t want to give people the idea we are going to be chopping trees down for biomass,” Halkett said.
“The actual reality is when the forestry industry pulls down a tree and harvests the timber, it generally only uses about 30% of that tree. So we’ve got 70% waste. So what are you doing with that waste? The truth is that waste is that its either being burned or decomposing. So we’re not adding to the problem at all,” Verdant’s Richard Poole said.
Verdant and Sweetman, which have formed a partnership, say their first source of waste wood is these offcuts, the leftovers after the felled tree has been turned into straight wooden planks. The second source is what’s called forest residue – bits left on the ground like the tree’s canopy.
The third source, which Halkett says actually accounts for about half of all its waste wood, is industrial or residential timber destined for landfill. By his estimates, a whopping 15% of landfill is made up of timber products which could be burned.
These three streams are then mixed, turned into woodchips and sent over to the Verdant Power Station as fuel, though the majority is exported to Japan – a market Halkett says is hungry and heavily subsiding biomass after committing to move away from nuclear.
Which brings us to our next point: the cost. As has been noted, hydrogen – especially in its early years – is going to be a marginal business. Unlike wind and solar, biomass doesn’t have a zero cost energy input. And using it to produce electricity requires stocks to be constantly replenished.
Even though Verdant is relying on an energy source that isn’t free, its CEO claims his company is expecting to be able to produce some of Australia’s most competitive hydrogen. “We’re one of the cheapest hydrogen producers at the moment,” he said.
It’s not clear to precisely what extent the subsidisation of timber industries has afforded this competitiveness, but it is worth noting that as an old and established trade, the timber industry enjoys generous government subsidies which have gone on so long they’re often forgotten, like budgetary wallpaper.
“The logging industry in every state has been propped up, is propped up, by millions of taxpayer dollars every year and there’s no indication that a native forest biomass industry would be able to stand on its own two feet without massive government subsidies,” Suzanne Harter, Climate Change and Clean Energy Campaigner at the Australian Conservation Fund told pv magazine Australia.
There are other costs to burning wood too, Harter says. The most obvious being the impacts it has on habitats and biodiversity. In a country still reeling from the Black Summer bushfires which burned 18.6 million hectares, nearly the size of England, and killed or displaced three billion animals, the continued logging of unburned forests in many states has been met with fierce community ire.
“We also don’t know all of the [forests’] services. We know that forests provide a whole range of ecosystem services, it’s not just one thing – it’s not just habitat, it’s not just oxygen – but there are a whole lot of things which we don’t fully understand yet the interconnected web that they are part of,” Harter said.
“Trees even impact the climate and they allow a whole lot of other things to grow… So I think the idea of moving cautiously when it comes to our forests and protecting the nature we still have left is very, very important,” she added.
Harter also has concerns about what’s deemed ‘waste’ wood, grounded in both the looseness of the definition and the quick derailment of the biomass situation in Europe.
“The definition of ‘waste’ by the woodchip industry is basically any tree that’s not suitable for logging,” Harter said. “The definition does allow quite a lot of wood to be put into those furnaces… you could certainly go a lot further than what we would want to call genuine waste.”
“It’s quite a slippery slope,” she added. “Once you have a industry that relies on cutting things down, you just keep cutting things down.” Which is just what has happened in Europe, where the industry for woodchips or wood pellets imported from the United States increased from almost nothing in the early 2000s to almost five million tonnes of pellets by 2015. The industry still claims to be running on waste, but environmental groups say there’s evidence untouched forest has been felled to feed demand. As Harter says, the EU has gone well beyond the “sustainable means they intended to use” when biomass was first posited as a ‘transition fuel’ for the region in the 90s.
“We’re not at that point here, obviously, but it’s an example that if you start an industry that requires this sort of fuel, and trees don’t grow fast enough, you’re going to have to be taking out new areas to sustain an ongoing demand,” Harter said.
A handful of hydrogen projects clearly don’t pose this kind of threat, Harter added, but it’s a road traversed by numerous countries in the last few decades, many of which now house a chorus of critics saddled with grievances.
The logic of carbon accounting and biomass’s net zero classification is also a sticking point for Harter. And she isn’t alone. This year, more than 500 scientists signed an open letter to world leaders calling on them to “stop treating the burning of biomass as carbon neutral”. Others have attempted to go through the court system to revoke the status, as was done in the European Court of Justice in 2019, and last year in South Korea.
In a perfect world, burning and regrowing trees is a closed carbon loop – but our world is far from perfect and scientists are increasingly arguing biomass industries are destroying trees, our only proven carbon sequestering technology, only to dump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere amid an already out of control climate crisis.
Verdant and Sweetman refute this argument. They say biomass, while not perfect, is a step in the right direction and will help rid our country of its dependence on coal but providing a base load alternative.
“This is absolutely the plan: to see us have 100% green grid. No one has come up with one yet so this a pretty solid proposal to move forward. So it’s just about getting your head around ‘is this good or is this bad?’ well, the truth is, it’s a lot lot better than where we are now,”  Verdant’s Poole said.
“That doesn’t mean that in 10 or 15 years there’s not going to be technological advancements but for now it’s a bloody good solution.”
Harter remains unconvinced. For her, the fact that Australia ended up including biomass in its category of renewable energy sources is lamentable and the root of ongoing problems.
By including biomass, it opens up its industries to access renewable funding, taking resources from more genuinely clean industries, she says. “You hate to see that money diverted into a very inefficient, relatively destructive type of energy and taking away support from genuinely cleaner, safer options.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/21/maoneng-make-public-its-plans-for-mornington-240-mwp-480-mwh-big-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JULY 21, 2021",Maoneng make public plans for Mornington 240 MWp/480 MWh big battery,"Australian renewable energy developer Maoneng is proposing to build a 240 MWp/480 MWh Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) on the popular Mornington Peninsula on the Victorian coast. The proposed site is in Tyabb and has been chosen as it sits adjacent to AusNet’s existing Tyabb substation.
Maoneng lodged a planning permit application with the Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning to build the big battery in December 2020 and its plans just have opened for public exhibition.
The company is currently undertaking a competitive tender process to select its contractor for the project, and says it’s aiming to have the big battery completed by late 2022.
Maoneng’s proposed site is 6.7 hectares, flat, and largely already cleared of vegetation, making it ideal for such a project, the company says. Interested parties will now be able to lodge a submission to the Victorian Department, with Maoneng saying it encourages the community to engage it with any queries they have.
The Mornington Peninsula traditionally experiences fluctuations in its demand for electricity, primarily because of seasonal tourism. Maoneng’s co-founder and CEO Morris Zhou said the Mornington BESS represented an important piece of the puzzle here. “A vital part of the Victorian Government’s Renewable Energy Action Plan is the integration of energy storage. Our facility directly supports this strategy and will play a key role in local grid stability,” Zhou said in a statement.
Earlier this month, Maoneng submitted plans to construct a 225 MW/450 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) on a 30-hectare site at Gould Creek, about 20 kilometres north of Adelaide’s city centre. The $112.5 million Gould Creek battery storage project builds on the company’s Australian portfolio which includes a deal to develop four large-scale batteries, each 50 MW/100 MWh in capacity in New South Wales, for energy giant AGL.
The deal includes a 15-year contract that will allow AGL to call on capacity from the batteries at a fixed price. The batteries are expected to be installed by 2023.
Data supplied by the Clean Energy Council (CEC) shows that financial commitments for new utility-scale battery projects in Australia increased four-fold between Q4 2020 and Q1 2021, from 150 MW to 600 MW in the first three months of this year.

As well as those projects to have reached financial close, the CEC said at least 15 other large-scale battery storage projects have been announced this year, representing more than 6.6 GW of capacity and $4.3 billion in investment.
That number is likely to increase with the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) proposing a new rule in April to bring new, ultra-fast frequency services into the NEM, services that will come largely from batteries.

Just below a third (29.4%) want the clean energy transition to happen in the next decade, with 45.5% supporting the transition to renewables-dominated grid in the next 15 years.
Queensland is a major coal exporter and its regions are historically conservative bases which, until quite recently, were strongholds for right-wing politicians like Pauline Hanson and Clive Palmer. Given this, the findings of the survey, which was commissioned by Queensland-based community group Solar Citizens and conducted by uComms on July, 14 2021, are particularly interesting.
The survey of eligible voters excluded those in the greater Brisbane area and Gold Coast, metropolitan hubs which tend to be more progressive. It’s also worth noting that while the state tends conservative federally, it has elected Labor governments at the state level for the majority of the last three decades (though Labor hardly has a history which could see it lauded as a renewable energy cheerleader). Nonetheless, the Palaszczuk government has placed investment in clean energy at the front and centre of its Covid recovery plan, establishing a $2 billion renewable and hydrogen fund to ‘supercharge’ jobs.
It would seem such a plan even has majority support in the regions, with 51.6% of respondents either agreeing or strongly agreeing clean energy industries like renewable hydrogen production will be major employers by 2030.
Queensland Minister for Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen, Mick De Brenni, just yesterday revealed some of the details of his 10-year energy plan for the state which Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk commissioned him to deliver earlier this month. This too would seem to have majority support in the regions alone, with 52.1% of respondents saying the state government should develop a plan to move all Queensland’s electricity to come from clean sources like wind and solar.
While, as minister de Brenni said yesterday, Queensland does seem to be displaying a surge in interest and goodwill towards renewables, Solar Citizen’s Energy Strategist Stephanie Gray expressed concern that young regional Queenslanders seem reluctant to embrace new technologies.
While Solar Citizens did not reveal any of the survey’s key findings for this particular demographic, Gray indicated that young people – a demographic which tends to widely support renewables – were less enthusiastic in the state’s region.
“What’s interesting about the results is that, while there’s absolutely an appetite for more clean energy amongst regional Queenslanders, it’s younger people that were the most reluctant to transition our power supply,” she said.
“I think this demonstrates that governments are not doing enough to show young people what the jobs of the future look like – there are actually really exciting economic opportunities that regional Queensland can benefit from as the world transitions to cleaner energy and electric transport,” Gray added.

Though lithium-ion batteries are already powering various devices that we rely on every day, and their presence in vehicles and on electricity grids is rapidly increasing, the technology still has a few shortfalls when it comes to performance and longevity.
Much of the research that’s underway into improving today’s battery technologies is focused on working with new materials, also keeping in supply chain and environmental concerns related to several commonly investigated materials. But whatever material is used, sophisticated new techniques allowing scientists to observe mechanisms at work within the battery in minute detail will be essential to understanding where the issues that hold back performance are occurring, and how to get around them.
Two separate studies published in the past month have used such techniques to examine the role of oxygen in lithium-ion battery performance. It was already known that as the battery charges and discharges, tiny amounts of oxygen are released. But the tiny scale of this process makes it difficult to observe, and the wider effects of oxygen loss are not well understood. “The total amount of oxygen leakage, over 500 cycles of battery charging and discharging, is 6%,” explained Peter Csernica, a scientist at Stanford University who worked on one of the studies. “That’s not such a small number, but if you try to measure the amount of oxygen that comes out during each cycle, it’s about one one-hundredth of a percent.”
In the study led by Stanford University, the group sliced open battery electrodes after cycling and scanned samples using an x-ray microscope; and combined this with computational imaging to observe the structure at the nanoscale. They also shot x-rays through whole electrodes, to confirm that their observations at the nanoscale could be applied to the full component. Results of this analysis have been published in Nature Energy. The group found that oxygen is initially released in a ‘burst’ from the surface, and then a slower ‘trickle’ from deeper inside the cathode.
And they found that the release of oxygen fundamentally alters the structure of the cathode: “When oxygen leaves, surrounding manganese, nickel and cobalt atoms migrate. All the atoms are dancing out of their ideal positions. This rearrangement of metal ions, along with chemical changes caused by the missing oxygen, degrades the voltage and efficiency of the battery over time,” explained Stanford associate professor William Chueh. “People have known aspects of this phenomenon for a long time, but the mechanism was unclear.”
In a separate study, published in Advanced Energy Materials, scientists led by Japan’s Tohoku University found that, in a cathode based on equal amounts of nickel, cobalt, and manganese the oxygen release facilitates several unwanted reactions that deteriorate the battery structure, and that the presence of highly valent nickel in the cathode led to higher levels of oxygen release, and that the process overall reduces the battery’s ability to hold a balanced charge (valence is a measure of an element’s capacity to combine with other atoms).
“Our findings will contribute to the further development of high energy density and robust next-generation batteries composed of transition metal oxides,” said Tohoku University researcher Takashi Nakamura.
By highlighting the role played by oxygen in battery degradation and confirming that it may be a more important piece of the puzzle than previously thought, both of these studies promise to provide the basis for future work that takes into account, or even focuses on, limiting the loss of oxygen during cycling and the damaging effects this has on the battery.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/21/china-added-13-gw-of-solar-to-the-end-of-june/,"MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",PV MAGAZINE,"JULY 21, 2021",China added 13 GW of solar to the end of June,"From pv magazine Global
China’s National Energy Administration has announced solar power generation capacity in the nation hit 268 GW at the end of last month, marking a 23.7% rise from the volume deployed at the same point last year.
The government body said 13.01 GW of solar capacity was added in the first half of the year with 5.86 GW of it accounted for by residential arrays which qualified for government subsidy.
The solar figures are higher than expected given the rise in photovoltaic product prices caused in recent months by a global shortage of solar panel raw material polysilicon, and mark the biggest volume of first-half additions in three years, since Beijing announced, in June 2018, a plan to taper down subsidy support in a bid for the technology to hit grid parity with conventional electricity generation.
That major policy shift saw 11.65 GW of solar added in China in the first half of 2019 and 10.15 GW in the same period of last year.
Solar industry analysts will have noted the 292 GW of wind power generation capacity reached in China by the end of June marked an even more impressive year-on-year increase, of 34.7%, for the renewable energy technology, as the nation’s overall power generation fleet grew 9.5%, to 2.26 TW.
Industry observers fear the focus at the highest level has shifted to wind power to deliver China’s national zero-carbon ambition, due to the recent price rises in the photovoltaics supply chain.
However, the polysilicon price appears to have stopped rising and downstream solar wafer and cell prices have begun to retreat, offering hope for solar installation figures in the current half of the year.
