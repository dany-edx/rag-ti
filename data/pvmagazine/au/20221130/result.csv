Azelio is seeking to commercialise energy storage in molten aluminium. Its TES.POD product seems to work in four steps – first it is charged by a renewable source of electricity, which is then stored in the form of heat in a recycled aluminium alloy, with a phase change at 600 C. The heat is in turn dispatched to a Stirling engine, which is a closed-cycle regenerative heat engine with a permanent gaseous working fluid. The engine generates usable heat with a temperature ranging from 55 C to 65 C and electricity that can be utilised on demand at all hours of the day.
The company says five of these devices have been ordered by MPG Built, a subsidiary of Molnar Property Group. With little information available, what can be said of this company is that it is based in Wollongong, south of Sydney, but its relationship to renewables isn’t at all clear. Molnar is listed as a real estate developer while MPG Built apparently specialises in fencing.
“Based on the conditional order, Azelio AB will, through a SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle), install solar power and its long-duration energy storage system for clean low-cost power. Electricity will be supplied to MPG Built, based on an Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) model,” Azelio’s release reads.
A SPV is a separate legal entity formed to undertake a specific business purpose or activity – meaning Azelio seems to be planning to form a subsidiary for the purpose of doing business in Australia.
“The SPV will implement, own, and operate the power system and provide energy to MPG Built at terms defined in the agreement,” it says. “MPG Built acting as a merchant [and] will on-sell the power to the grid.”
Azelio goes on to say its agreement with MPG Built covers 20 years and is expected to generate a revenue of up to $615,000 (USD 414,000) in the first year. Where those revenues will come from is also murky as the company includes very little information on its envisioned “Energy-as-a-Service” model.
“The agreement, which is estimated to require investments of EUR 3 – 4 million [$4.6 – 6 million] is subject to Azelio arranging financing for the SPV, which is expected to be facilitated by the solar element of the project,” the company said.
The solar part of the system is expected to be installed and in operation in 2023, according to Azelio. “Delivery of the energy storage system, and start of operation of the complete power system, are expected in 2024.”
Azelio CEO Jonas Wallmander said “Australia has excellent market conditions for our long-duration energy storage solution … This can help pave the way for a broader introduction of our technology in the region, and I am convinced that long-duration energy storage solutions, such as ours, can play a great role in increasing the use of renewable energy in this part of the world.”

Purified spherical graphite (PSG) is a key component of lithium-ion batteries, which is why a handful of companies across the globe are racing to become the first producers outside of China to stake the prime spot as the global wave of demand begins to take off.
According to a company statement the PEPR approval allows it to process up to 1.65 million tonnes of graphite, a crucial component of lithium-ion battery production. At that rate, Renascor says it can produce up to 150,000 tonnes of graphite concentrates each year. Renascor intends to use the graphite concentrates to produce PSG for use in lithium-ion battery anodes.
The Siviour Graphite Deposit is located in South Australia’s Eyre Peninsula and is among the world’s largest reported graphite deposits.

Renascor Managing Director David Christensen said the news brings Renascor a step closer to becoming a producer of 100% Australian-made purified spherical graphite. For Christensen this dream cannot be realised soon enough for “there is growing potential for substantial upstream bottlenecks in the graphite-anode-battery supply chain due in large part to the lengthier approval process associated with new graphite mining operations relative to rapidly growing anode capacity.”

Through Export Finance Australia, the Australian government approved a $185 million (USD 124 million) loan facility funding to the BAM Project, provided it received PEPR approval. The company says it is already in discussions with “leading anode, battery and electric vehicle manufacturers in northeast Asia, Europe and the United States concerning potential PSG offtake.”
The Saviour Graphite Mine and Concentrator will consist of a conventional open-pit mine and crush, grind, float processing circuit. The deposit’s near-surface, flat-lying orientation is particularly favourable, and Renascor predicts a 40-year mine life.
There are a handful of other companies banking on market appetite for diversifying PSG supply chains outside of China. Norway, Sweden and Germany are all in the game, and closer to home Western Australian startup International Graphite is well on its way.

The announcement also included the news that Meridian’s joint venture partner for the project, Contact Energy, has pulled out. The reason for the withdrawal was not given, with Meridian simply saying Contact Energy had decided not to continue into the next phase of the project as a development partner, though it will remain a potential electricity supplier.
Amid the comings and goings is Japan’s Mitsui & Co. Meridian says Mitsui – which boasts the largest share of ammonia imports into Japan – is also now in discussions to join the project.
The proposal will now move into the final investment decision stage. Then, subject to finalising commercial arrangements, Meridian, Woodside, and Mitsui will work towards commencing front-end engineering design for the project.
The Southern Green Hydrogen project was proposed in June 2021 to explore the opportunity of producing green hydrogen in Southland following the announcement Rio Tinto would close its Tiwai Point aluminium smelter, primarily powered by a Meridian hydroelectric plant. 
The vision is to build a 600 MW facility which would use the power from Meridian’s Manapouri hydro scheme to energise hydrogen electrolysers, targeting an annual production of 500,000 tonnes of ammonia.
“We expect the facility will have the added benefit of being able to provide up to 40% of New Zealand’s dry year flexibility needs to the electricity sector,” Meridian Energy CEO Neal Barclay said.
Nonetheless, there are doubts about the potential demand for Asia-Pacific ammonia megaprojects as Europe and the US usher in superior policy environments.
Nonetheless, winning the project is undoubtedly important for Woodside, which is facing sharp and renewed criticism over its Scarborough gas project, a sustained focus of environmental group Greenpeace. Woodside is looking to stay relevant through its move into hydrogen, but is notably pursuing both blue (hydrogen made from fossil gas) as well as some green, renewable projects.

A group of scientists from the DLR Institute of Networked Energy Systems in Germany has proposed to utilise a three-step method to quantify energy fluctuations in PV systems in an effort to estimate the flexibility potential of buildings and city districts hosting solar arrays.
The novelty of the methodology consists of providing not only the amount of energy that must be reserved or shifted locally for balancing purposes within a day, but also the required duration of energy reserving or shifting.
“The developed method distinguishes between power and energy fluctuations of PV systems,” the academics said. “The quantification of the power fluctuations only requires technical characteristics and time series with the measured power values of the PV systems.”
The proposed method is based on analyses of the so-called power ramp, which the researchers describe as the difference in power values between two successive points in time in a PV system. The three steps consist of the classification of the days with PV generation in the “low variability” and “high variability,” the computation of the distribution of PV power ramps, and the calculation of PV energy fluctuations.
This method computes power ramps at each point in time and the energy fluctuations on a daily basis. “Because the PV power prediction uncertainties are summed over the day, the computed daily energy fluctuations can be compared to the capacity of the local flexibility sources to estimate whether the available flexibility sources have a sufficient amount of energy to balance the daily energy fluctuations,” they further explained.
The research group tested its method in seven PV systems with a capacity ranging from 1.2 kW to 100 kW, located in either northern or southern Germany. Through this analysis, it found that days with high variability and those with low variability feature characteristic distributions of PV power ramps. “The computed distributions of the power ramps enable the magnitudes of power fluctuations that arise most frequently in a given PV system to be estimated,” it said. “In other words, based on the computed distributions, the probability of any power ramp of any PV system can be determined for the given variability class.”
The researchers said the testing showed that PV installations located in the same area should have similar distributions of power ramps. “However, all of the investigated PV systems are located in Germany in western Europe. It may be academically interesting to apply the developed method to PV systems in other locations with apparently differing climate and weather conditions,” they stated.
The researchers also claim the new approach can support adequate dimensioning of the PV system in buildings and be integrated into energy management systems for scheduling the operation for the next day.
They described the novel methodology in the paper “Quantifying power and energy fluctuations of photovoltaic systems,” published in Energy Science & Engineering. “The proposed methodology for quantifying PV energy fluctuations can be applied to any PV system if solar radiation predictions for its particular location and technical parameters are available,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/30/philippines-increases-net-metering-size-limit-for-renewables-to-1-mw/,"MARKETS,POLICY,PHILIPPINES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 30, 2022",Philippines increases net-metering size limit for renewables to 1 MW,"From pv magazine Global 
The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) of the Philippines has approved new rules for distributed energy resources (DERs) with capacities up to 1 MW. It said the new provisions will go into force within 15 days from publication in the country’s official gazette.
The new provisions introduce the possibility for distributed renewable energy system owners to be remunerated for up to 30% of the surplus power they inject into the grid.
“The DER rules include guidelines, interconnection standards, Certificate of Compliance (COC) requirements, pricing methodologies, commercial arrangements governing the sale of energy produced and operations of the DER and payment of subsidies, among others,” the ERC said.
Since 2008, the Philippines has only allowed net metering for renewable energy systems below 100 kW in size. However, the scheme has failed to provide significant growth. Most of the existing rooftop PV capacity in the Philippines was actually deployed through a feed-in tariff system, which has now expired.
The Philippines plans to install 15 GW of clean energy by 2030. Recent statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency show that the country had an installed PV capacity of 1.08 GW by the end of 2021.
