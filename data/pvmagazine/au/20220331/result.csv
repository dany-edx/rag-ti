https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/31/what-tomorrows-sres-changes-mean-for-australias-solar-industry/,"LEGAL,POLICY,QUALITY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 31, 2022",What tomorrow’s SRES changes mean for Australia’s solar industry,"From tomorrow, April 1, new rules for solar retailers, installers and manufacturers will come into effect. While these will require minor modifications from both installers and manufacturers, the biggest impacts will be felt among retailers. “There’s a whole new class for retailers, that’s the big one. And that will ultimately do the job that the voluntary codes of conduct were unable to do,” Grimes told pv magazine Australia.
Having recently taken over as sole regulator of the SRES scheme, the Commonwealth-run Clean Energy Regulator has far more power than its predecessor, the Clean Energy Council, and, Grimes says, is “deadly serious” about punishing noncompliance.
Solar retailers will now need to make formal written declarations that every system it sells is going to perform as promised and meet standards when filing for small-scale technology certificates (STCs), the digital documents which inform the total solar rebate a system receives.
The intent here is to ensure that it’s not only solar installers who are on the line for badly performing systems, which Grimes says has largely been the case to date, but the retailers which sold the system.
“The problem in the solar industry is actually not poor technical installation, it’s dodgy sales practices,” he said. Since installers have always been heavily regulated, Grimes described the development to extend that regulatory framework around retailers “as, in my view, a very positive thing.”
Grimes conceded the changes will involve more paperwork for installers, who are already “fatigued,” Grimes said, by skills shortages and Covid-19 mandates.
One of the major changes for installers will be the requirement of photographic evidence that the lead installer was onsite during the beginning, middle and end of the install. In short, they’ll have to take a lot of selfies on roofs. 
Installers “don’t love” these changes, Grimes said. He’s increasingly hearing of installers fed up with the system and planning to move back into general electric. While he said he understands the frustration around increased paperwork and the feeling on endless bureaucracy, he implored installers to “stick with it” saying the improved regulatory framework will be beneficial in the longterm.
The changes for installers, he said, will “catch out the bottom feeders and ultimately that’s a good thing for the industry.”
Also kicking in tomorrow is the requirement for all solar panels and inverters to have their serial numbers recorded in a Clean Energy Regulator ledger.
Grimes estimates 70% to 90% of the market are already doing this, but it will officially be mandatory starting April.
Green Energy Markets
It’s worth noting these new ledgers are not the same as the Solar Panel Validation initiative launched in 2018. While both contain serial number tracking, the two frameworks will sit side by side. If manufacturers or importers are already participating in the Solar Panel Validation scheme, ensuring those same serial numbers are being transferred across to the Regulator’s ledgers should, by all accounts, be a simple process.
As mentioned, the Clean Energy Council had previously overseen many elements of the SRES scheme, including accreditation of installer and retailer services as well as equipment components. This will no longer remain the case.
The Clean Energy Regulator has signalled it plans to approach the market to select its accreditation service providers. Which means, Grimes says, the accreditation services will be “market tested” and awarded to a provider which will need to outcompete others to prove it will have the best outcome, integrity, and service.
It’s possible the Clean Energy Council will be able to win back its role in this way, but the Regulator has also flagged it could provision multiple bodies  – moving away from a monopoly model which Grimes described as “poor public policy.”
“The principle of actually having contestability for [accreditation services] is a good thing for the clients, which are the solar industry,” he said.
Australian Solar Council
Grimes says there will also probably be some contestability in terms of equipment component accreditations. “So the approved components list, it will be marked tested. Again, a good development,” he said.
More details on how the Regulator plans to move forward here and which bodies will oversee solar accreditations is expected in the next year.
Grimes says the fact the Clean Energy Regulator is now the authority overseeing the SRES scheme marks an important change.
As a Commonwealth agency, the Regulator has considerable legal prosecution powers as well as tools for in-depth oversight. 
This, Grimes says, will go a long way for stamping out solar “phoenixing” which has long been considered an issue in Australia’s landscape. “Phoenixing” is when companies close to skirt their ongoing obligations to customers and often debts, then set up shop with the same personnel under a new company name. 
The new Regulator is able to track both company directors and office holders, making this practice in the solar industry untenable, Grimes believes.
He thinks the industry may well see “heads on spikes” to serve as a warning to others.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/31/chinchilla-battery-to-charge-up-queenslands-renewable-energy-revolution/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 31, 2022",Chinchilla battery to charge up Queensland’s renewable energy revolution,"The Queensland government has described CS Energy’s plan to build a 100MW two-hour battery energy storage system beside the existing coal-fired Kogan Creek Power Station near Chinchilla as a pivotal part of the state’s “renewable energy revolution”.
CS Energy said on Wednesday that work on the $150 million Chinchilla battery, which will feature lithium-ion energy storage technology supplied by United States-based electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla, is expected to begin later this year with the battery set to be operational by late 2023.
Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the grid-scale battery will help facilitate the continued integration of renewables into the state’s energy system with Queensland targeting 50% renewable energy by 2030.
“This battery represents further diversification of energy and modernisation of Queensland publicly owned power companies,” he said.
“Queenslanders want clean energy, but they also want reliable energy, so the inclusion of batteries into the CS Energy portfolio will support further expansion of their variable (renewable) energy assets alongside existing traditional generation.”
CS Energy chief executive officer Andrew Bills said the battery storage project would provide the flexibility to shift energy to support the continued roll out of renewables and to provide grid stability.
“Large-scale batteries are an important next step in creating a more flexible and diversified energy portfolio for CS Energy,” he said.
“Adding firm, fast-start generation assets to CS Energy’s portfolio will enable us to more effectively respond to the changing demand and shape of the National Electricity Market (NEM).”
Bills said the Chinchilla Battery would make use of existing transmission infrastructure, connecting to the grid via Powerlink’s 275kV Western Downs substation.
“This project is about utilising the Kogan Creek site’s existing attributes of grid connection, water, land and workforce to create new opportunities,” he said.

The Chinchilla battery is the newest addition to the energy hub CS Energy is creating at the Kogan Creek site. The hub will also include the Kogan Renewable Hydrogen Demonstration Plant which is to feature a 600-700kW hydrogen electrolyser, a 2MW solar farm and a hydrogen fuel cell of up to 50kW.
The solar-powered hydrogen facility, which is set to produce 50 tonnes of green hydrogen annually, is expected to be operating before the end of 2023.
The battery is also expected to be operational in late 2023 with construction set to begin later this year after all relevant development approvals have been finalised.
The Chinchilla battery is the latest in a string of utility scale battery energy storage projects being developed across Queensland.
The 100MW/150MWh Wandoan South project being developed on the Western Downs by Singapore-based Vena Energy is currently progressing through the commissioning process while state-owned energy company Stanwell is developing a 150MW/300MWh battery adjacent to the 1.4GW Tarong Power Station site in the South Burnett.
Sydney-based renewable energy developer Genex Power has detailed plans to develop its 50MW/100MWh Bouldercombe Battery Project near Rockhampton on the state’s central coast while AGL Energy plans to build a 100 MW/150 MWh battery next to the 453MW Cooper’s Gap wind farm near Kingaroy.
French renewables developer Neoen is planning to build 150MW of battery storage as part of its proposed 460MW Western Downs Green Power Hub to be constructed near Chinchilla and has also submitted plans to develop a 100MW battery project in the state’s far north.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/31/retail-giants-unite-to-secure-renewable-power-deal-with-cleanco/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 31, 2022",Retail giants unite to secure renewable power deal with CleanCo,"The four retailers, part of the Perth-based Wesfarmers conglomerate, announced on Thursday they had inked a renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) with state-owned renewables company CleanCo to power 147 sites across Queensland with wind and solar energy.
Renewable electricity will be provided primarily from the 400MW Western Downs Green Power Hub being developed near Chinchilla in Queensland’s Western Downs region by French renewables and storage developer Neoen.
Neoen says the solar farm, the largest either built or under construction in Australia, is scheduled to come online in late 2022.
The PPA will also utilise wind energy sourced from the 1,026MW MacIntyre Wind Farm being built by Spanish renewables developer Acciona Energia near Warwick on the Southern Downs. The wind farm is expected to be operational in 2024.
Wesfarmers said its retail divisions had joined forces to work with CleanCo to structure a unique arrangement that allowed them to contract separately while leveraging their combined energy loads, demand profiles and number of sites. The PPA includes 31 Kmart stores, 16 Target, 28 Officeworks and 61 Bunnings Queensland stores.
The participating stores will use a combined ~140,000MWh of renewable energy each year by mid-2025, following a staggered onboarding of sites starting July 2022. This is equivalent to the energy consumption of approximately 23,000 Australian households each year.
Wesfarmers said the new partnership is a step towards all four retailers sourcing 100% renewable electricity by 2025, and supporting each retailer’s achievement of net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030.
“The approach is consistent with the retailers’ approach of investing in energy efficiency initiatives to reduce usage in the first instance, installing onsite solar generation and storage where feasible, and sourcing the balance of needs from large-scale renewable electricity generation,” the company said.

Bunnings Group managing director Michael Schneider said the PPA builds on the work the hardware giant has already done to increase its renewable power use by installing solar PV systems at 88 sites across Australia.
“While we’ve made positive headway, we recognise we have a lot more to do in this space, and we look forward to pursuing more initiatives to reduce our footprint,” he said.
The announcement of the PPA comes after CleanCo last year signed an offtake agreement with Neoen to purchase the majority of the output from the Western Downs Green Energy Hub. CleanCo agreed to purchase 352MWp of the project’s 460MWp capacity.
Since then, CleanCo has signed a string of PPAs, including a 10-year agreement to supply supermarket giant Coles with more than 90% of its Queensland energy requirements. Australian mining giant BHP has also signed a five-year PPA with CleanCo as it looks to cut emissions from its electricity use at its Queensland coal mines by 50% by 2025.

Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the latest PPA further demonstrates the state is making progress on its target of 50% renewable energy by 2030.
“This is proof our publicly-owned CleanCo is getting on with the job of connecting businesses in Queensland to clean, reliable energy from Queensland renewables and helping decarbonise our economy,” he said.
“They join CleanCo’s growing portfolio of partners, leading to further opportunity for our publicly owned renewables, low-emissions, and hydro business, to now grow its footprint of built, owned and operated assets.”
Greenpeace Australia Pacific REenergise campaign director Lindsay Soutar welcomed Wesfarmers’ PPA announcement but called on the retailers to cut deals to meet their 100% renewable electricity commitments in other states by 2025.
“Kmart, Bunnings, Target and Officeworks combined are Australia’s 33rd largest electricity user,” she said.
“Making the switch to clean power in Queensland will make a big dent in Australia’s emissions and bring even more clean, reliable renewable power into our energy mix.
“Ending reliance on fossil fuels like coal and switching to renewable energy is critical for tackling climate change, and these companies are showing how it can be done.”

It was the fastest rising source of electricity generation for the 17th consecutive year.
Ember said solar generated 3.7% of the world’s electricity in 2021 and Australia is at the vanguard, sourcing 12% of its electricity from the renewable technology, the highest proportion of any major country in the world.
While solar generation rose 23% globally in 2021, wind supply gained 14% over the same period, increasing 227TWh to 1,814TWh. Together, both renewable sources accounted for 10.3% of total global electricity generation, up 1% from 2020. Combined, wind and solar are now the fourth largest source of electricity in the world.

David Jones, program lead at Ember, said the report demonstrated that wind and solar had arrived, with clean sources generating 38% of the world’s electricity in 2021.
“The process that will reshape the existing energy system has begun,” he said.
“Even as coal and power emissions hit another all-time high, there are clear signs that the global electricity transition is well underway. More wind and solar is being added to grids than ever. And not just in a few countries, but across the world.
“We’re getting closer to that break-even where wind and solar can cover new electricity demand, but we are still not quite there. If we maintain those growth rates we see, we will be there shortly.”
Ember’s report analysed annual power generation data for 209 countries from 2000 to 2020. For 2021, data was added from 75 countries, which together represented 93% of global demand.
The report shows that 50 countries generated more than 10% of their power from wind and solar, with Australia’s shift to wind and solar energy in the past two years greater than anywhere in the world except the Netherlands.
Ember said the share of solar and wind in Australia’s electricity market rose from 13% to 22% last year.

Jones said Australia’s renewable energy transition had been driven by the widespread embrace of rooftop solar and had occurred despite the federal government’s continued support for fossil fuels.
“This is very different from many countries, where national governments lead the charge,” he said.
“It’s very refreshing to see so many people embracing homegrown solar, even as the national government continues to push for more oil and gas.”
Despite the record growth in wind and solar, the report also revealed that coal-fired power generation saw its fastest growth since at least 1985, rising 9% in 2021 to 10,042TWh. The record rise in coal was not matched by global gas generation, which increased by only 1% in 2021.
This came in a year of rapid demand recovery, as 2021 saw the largest recorded annual increase of 1,414TWh in global electricity demand, up 5.4% and the equivalent of adding a new India to global demand, the report said.

The new era of the power grid may be characterised by large power plants and sprawling transmission lines, but also by local, flexible energy sources. This is the vision that venture capitalist Bill Nussey outlines in “Freeing Energy.”
He sees billion-dollar opportunities for innovators that can reimagine how energy is created, stored, and delivered. This new grid concept is already underway, and the latest example is the collaboration between Vermont utility Green Mountain Power and energy storage specialist Enphase.
The two companies have said that Green Mountain Power will offer Enphase batteries at a significant discount in a pilot lease program. Enphase will provide 100 eligible customers with two Enphase IQ Battery 10 units for US$65 (AU$86) per month for 10 years, or for a single payment of US$6,500 (AU$8,600). That cost does not include installation. Homeowners benefit from reliable backup power, while also sharing stored energy during times of high demand to help reduce overall costs for all GMP customers.
“With the new IQ8 microinverters, our customers will be able to easily expand their home battery system over time, giving them even more peace of mind about their energy future. This partnership allows the homeowners, local contractors, and utilities to use Enphase’s state-of-the-art technology to help create a more reliable, affordable, and cleaner grid for all of Vermont,” said Liam Madden, director of solar energy at HB Energy Solutions.
Green Mountain Power has another virtual power plant offering, the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) program. Under BYOD, upfront payments of up to US$9,500 (AU$12,600) are offered depending on the capacity of the systems enrolled. Green Mountain Power said homeowners that retrofit an existing solar system in one of the areas of the state where battery power is needed most may be eligible to receive an extra US$100 (AU$130) per kilowatt.
Program participants will be enrolled for a term of a minimum of 10 years. The Enphase batteries are lithium ferro-phosphate (LFP) chemistry batteries, which the company said provide a long life cycle and better safety through thermal stability. They are equipped with a feature to seamlessly power up air conditioners and well pumps in the event of grid power loss. The batteries come with a 10-year limited warranty.
Enphase is also launching Grid Services Manager, a distributed energy resource management system that Green Mountain Power will use to manage the virtual power plants. Enphase said it plans to offer this software to utility grid managers and distributed energy resource aggregators in the future.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/31/world-will-need-5-2tw-of-solar-this-decade-to-avoid-climate-breakdown/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,FINANCE,MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",MAX HALL,"MARCH 31, 2022",World will need 5.2TW of solar this decade to avoid climate breakdown,"From pv magazine Global
The world will need 5.2TW of solar power generation capacity by 2030, and 14TW by mid century, to have any chance of limiting global average temperature rises this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) said today.
The Abu Dhabi-based international body launched the latest edition of its World Energy Transitions Outlook report at the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue event and director-general Francesco La Camera, writing the foreword, spelled out: “Progress across all energy uses has been woefully inadequate.”
The world will have to install 450GW of new solar capacity each year – most of it utility scale – for the rest of this decade, with China and India to lead Asia to a roughly half share of the world’s installed PV capacity in 2030, the report’s authors estimated.
Elsewhere, North America will need to install 90GW per year of solar to claim a 14% share of the world’s operating panels at the end of the decade, and Europe’s 19% slice of the pie will require 55GW of annual solar capacity additions.
European funding will also help North Africa make its contribution to the 70GW of annual solar capacity additions which will be required across the Middle East and Africa with European energy demand ensuring grid connections with North Africa flourish.
To have a hope of avoiding the worst effects of climate change, Latin America will need 20GW of new solar annually this decade and a further “more than 2GW” will be needed each year across the Oceania and Pacific region, the Irena report estimated.
Of course, it is not just solar that the world needs and, with the 348-page report calling for massive electrification and energy efficiency efforts, enabled by the full suite of clean energy sources, hydrogen, and biomass, we will have to start devoting US$5.7 trillion per year to the energy transition for the rest of the decade, according to Irena.
That can be feasible if the US$700 billion per year channeled into fossil fuels is immediately diverted to the transition, the publication stated. Public investment in the transition will have to immediately double, too, said Irena, to attract the remaining money needed from the private sector, which would bear most of the financial burden.
In return for the investment sought – including to ensure there are 147 million electric vehicles (EVs) per year hitting the roads in 2050, that US$131 billion is invested annually in EV charging by that point, and that 350GW of green hydrogen electrolysers are operating as early as 2030 – the world can anticipate a jobs dividend.
Irena has estimated the 12 million job losses it anticipates in the fossil fuel and nuclear industries will be comfortably outweighed by “close to” 85 million new energy-transition roles this decade, including 26.5 million in clean energy.
It is all a matter of political will, Irena pointed out, with policymakers also needing to usher in sufficient international grid connections and flexibility; training; utility scale batteries; electricity demand-side management; digital tools; peer-to-peer power trading; community ownership of renewables; time-of-use energy tariffs; and net billing systems.
