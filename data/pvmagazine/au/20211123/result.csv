The company says it plans to match the amount in the grant, bringing its budget to $7 million in order to construct the new facility. 
A spokesperson from eleXsys told pv magazine Australia the new facility will manufacture its key hardware device “from scratch” for domestic and export markets. While eleXsys’ technology is most accurately described as a bundle including both hard and software, the device the company refers to here is effectively a miniaturised static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) device which sits beside a system’s inverter to provide reactive power and control voltage. Roughly the size of two desktop computer towers, the company says the device allows it to fit multiple times the renewable electricity into one-way grids, effectively preventing curtailment of exports using around 1% of the solar system’s power.
Thanks to the grant provided by the federal government as part of its Modern Manufacturing Initiative, eleXsys will be able to manufacture this hardware component in its base of Queensland. “Building our own advanced manufacturing facility will support more than 80 local jobs and is crucial to meeting the increasing demand for our eleXsys technology,” eleXsys Energy Executive Director Richard Romanowski said.
The company says it has now begun its site identification process, and expects the facility to be operational by the end of 2022.

eleXsys Energy, trading under Planet Ark Power, is currently developing Australia’s largest grid-connected microgrid atop a vast Ikea store adjacent to Adelaide Airport.
The vision for the project is to transform the Ikea into a “mini power station”, acting as living proof of its claim that the eleXsys technology can revolutionise the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment by removing the pesky and project hindering issue of curtailment.
The company says its technology has allowed the $8 million Ikea microgrid to become not only reality, but six times the size of what could otherwise connect to South Australia’s notoriously congested grid. Ikea’s 1.2 MWp rooftop solar array has already been installed, with its 700 kW carpark and 3.36 MW/3.45 MWh CATL battery energy storage system to be energised by April next year, supplying more than the store’s entire annual electricity needs. The system will be managed by the EleXsys platform, which Romanowski claims can allow PV and battery projects to be expanded as much as tenfold.
“The eleXsys solution is a prime example of the clever Australian innovation we will need to meet the Morrison government’s commitment to net zero emissions by 2050,” MP Trevor Evans, the federal Assistant Minister for Waste Reduction and Environmental Management, said of the grant.
“I am delighted to see these vital funds going towards supporting local manufacturing and highly-skilled jobs.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/23/australia-removes-much-criticised-dc-isolator-mandate/,"HIGHLIGHTS,LEGAL,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 23, 2021",Australia removes much-criticised DC isolator mandate,"The Australian solar installation standard AS/NZS 5033 has now been updated, removing the mandate for DC isolators to be installed on household solar systems if other safety measures are followed. The changes will come into effect in six months.
The update comes after much lobbying from various corners of industry who claim DC isolators, intended as a safety measure to disconnect solar system’s panels in case of a fault or emergency, actually made systems more vulnerable to fires and faults. Committee El-042, the group responsible for the rule change, received more than 680 submissions during the public comment stage of the rule change after it closed in June.
DC isolators were mandated in Australia in 2012 through the Australian Standard for PV installations, AS/NZS 5033. This made Australia the only country in the world requiring rooftop DC isolators. Since then, they have been proven by inspection data to be the largest single source of conventional DC solar system failures. DC isolators have also been criticised for making the solar system’s installation process more complex.
While AS/NZS 5033 recommends owners have their PV system inspected regularly and annually for system components like DC isolators, regular inspections were not required under state and territory electrical safety laws. Another disadvantage of isolator components is that they can degrade from environmental exposure due to specific installation methods and product type, increasing the likelihood of water ingress and ultraviolet radiation damage and, as a result, DC isolators may need to be replaced within the life of the panels of a PV system.

Sandy Atkins, who co-chaired the rule change committee, said the decision was made to remove the DC isolator mandate in Australia though because technological changes meant the standard was now limiting for installers. “At the time the 2014 standard was written, solar panels were at most 250W per panel, but technology is quickly changing, and it’s not unusual for panels to be greater than 400W,” Atkins said.
“If you still want to use DC isolators then you can, but if you don’t, the standard allows for other solutions such as disconnection points,” Atkins said.
The committee arrived at its decision after comparing different requirements around the world. In addition to the DC isolator change, it updated several other rule components, including requirements for microinverter installations and DC conditioning units, which it says will enable greater use of technology across larger panels and support better safety outcomes. It also lifted the 600V limit for panels on houses to align with the international standard of 1000V.
Proud as Australia might be about breaking residential solar records year on year, the rise in installations has coincided with an increase in fires. According to statistics from Fire and Rescue NSW, solar PV related fires have increased five-fold in the past five years. Isolation switches have been blamed for causing almost half of solar module fires.

The achievement came via two negative demand events in the early afternoon which surpassed the previous minimum demand event on September 28, 2016 (the infamous day of the SA system blackout). 
However, there was no such blackout this time. The first event took place between 12:20-12:50pm early Sunday afternoon, reaching a minimum of -46.4 MW at 12:35pm. The grid then went negative again from 13:25-13:50, reaching a minimum demand of -15.4 MW at 13:40. 
Reaction
Energy analysts throughout the industry reacted sprightly to the event, describing it as a world-first. Or, to put it in the words of Jess Hunt, senior advisor with the Energy Security Board (ESB), “Crickey! South Australia’s electricity demand went negative today…not really of course, but our rooftop PV output exceeded native demand and the remainder was exported interstate.” 
Hunt noted that if such a negative event were to happen on a grid-wide scale, “the lights will go out…it’s physics”, but thankfully for the moment that surplus can be sent interstate. “In a few years, the eastern States will have a surplus too at ceratin times,” Hunt continued, “so we’re building the capability to remotely switch off rooftop PV in an emergency, as well as looking at other ways to get value out of the energy so we don’t end up wasting it.” 
WattClarity’s Paul McCardle described the event as a “new low point”, and he didn’t mean it pejoratively. McCardle observed “One significant thing that has changed in the intervening 3 weeks is that the fuller effect of South Australia’s synchronous condensers are being felt, allowing thermal units to be backed off further than was previously the case. We can see this in this snapshot from NEMwatch for the 11:25 dispatch interval (NEM time) today.”
McCardle also pointed out that wind generation has been ramping down in SA, “which may be in part due to the sub-zero prices that South Australia has been experiencing as rooftop PV cleans up the lion’s share of underlying demand.”

According to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), which has been expecting such an event as it seeks to cope with increasing PV integration, “Rooftop solar provided 92% (at 1,220 MW) of South Australia’s electricity needs on Sunday, helping set a new minimum demand record of 104 MW from 12:30-1pm – down 45% from the previous record of 188 MW on 31 October 2021.” 

These events are unlikely to remain anomalous, especially as Australians are only continuing to install rooftop solar systems. And while system operators like AEMO hustle to come up with mechanisms to enable the grid to deal with such influxes of solar energy, negative events emphasise the need for battery storage and other such solutions to help spread Australia’s excess of solar energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/23/3d-solid-state-thin-film-battery-from-the-netherlands/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 23, 2021",3D solid-state thin film battery from the Netherlands,"From pv magazine Global
Dutch start-up LionVolt BV, a spin-off from the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), has announced it has secured €4 million (AU$6.2 million) from the development agency of the region of Brabant (the Brabantse Ontwikkelingsmaatschappij – BOM), in the Netherlands, and Amsterdam-based venture capital and growth equity firm Prime Ventures, through a funding round.
LionVolt said it will use the funds to develop its 3D solid-state thin-film battery technology, which it expects to apply initially in wearables and electric cars.
The battery is made with a foil covered with billions of pillars with thin layers of functional material that create a 3D structure with a very large surface area and very short distances between both battery electrodes. Through this architecture, the device’s lithium-ions have only a short distance to go through, and this, according to the manufacturer, reduces charging and discharging times.
LionVolt claims this approach enables the product to overcome two major hurdles to bring this technology to commercial production, which are the conformal coating of the full battery stack and the development of scalable manufacturing tools. The creation of the micropillar arrays is reportedly able to reduce the technological challenge of conformal coating, and the open and regular structure facilitates the deposition of consecutive layers.
The battery is claimed to offer higher energy density, a longer lifespan, and increased safety compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries.
The battery configuration is also said to be fully retrofittable into existing commercial formats and a production line can be set up in a very short time, according to the manufacturer, which said it wants to produce the new batteries in the Netherlands. “The BOM invests in LionVolt because the company has enormous potential,” said Jurgen van Eck, from the BOM. “Almost 80% of the supply chain the company needs to build a production line can be sourced locally.”
