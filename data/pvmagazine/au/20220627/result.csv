The 50-kilometre-long Murray Bridge to Onkaparinga Pipeline delivers water from the River Murray to the Mount Bold Reservoir and the Kanmantoo and Balhannah water treatment plants in the Adelaide Hills.
SA Water has installed 34,272 solar panels at the pipeline’s second pump station in Rocky Gully, about 80km south-east of Adelaide. The panels will collectively generate an estimated 25.6 GWh of solar electricity each year to power pumping operations.
SA Water’s Zero Cost Energy Future senior manager Nicola Murphy said the panels will be able to generate the equivalent energy capacity to power more than 4,000 average South Australian households and the site will achieve a carbon emissions reduction of about 11,000 tonnes each year.
“Now connected to our assets, these solar panels will significantly help to sustainably reduce our operating electricity costs and reliance on the national electricity grid, without compromising on the performance this vital pipeline plays in delivering trusted water for our customers,” she said.
“When you consider our annual electricity expenses reached more than $80 million in recent years, being able to harness large-scale renewable energy assets such as this will help to make a difference in reducing these significant costs over the coming years.”
The installation is part SA Water’s ongoing investment in renewable energy with the utility committing $300 million for solar PV and energy storage projects at its sites across the state.

One of the largest renewable energy projects in the Australian water industry, SA Water’s Zero Cost Energy Future initiative has involved the installation of more than 360,000 solar panels at 33 of the utility’s pipelines, pump stations and other assets.
Once progressively energised and connected to the national grid, these sites will generate 242 GWh of clean, green solar energy per annum, combined with 34 MWh of battery storage, Murphy said.
“Combined, these solar arrays will have the capacity to generate around 70% of our annual electricity needs in an average weather and water consumption year,” she said.
“There will still be times when we draw electricity from the grid, but we’ll offset those costs by storing and selling energy we produce at other times, to bring our net external electricity expenses down.”
SA Water is one of South Australia’s single largest electricity users, with its drinking water and wastewater pumping and treatment operations across the state costing approximately $86 million in 2020-21.
Its Zero Cost Energy Future initiative has earned accolades from the industry with the program collecting the Project Innovation Award at this year’s Australian Water Awards in Brisbane.

Anglo-Australian resources giant Rio Tinto was among a host of major investors which participated in the funding round. Other investors include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Equinor, Amazon, Honeywell and tech investors S2G Ventures, Capricorn Partners and Energy Impact Partners.
EH2 said the funding will support the development of the company’s electrolyser technology and the manufacturing and the deployment of the first commercial installations of its plants. EH2 said its modular systems have a minimum 100 MW capacity and will be able to produce as much as 48 tons of hydrogen per day for industrial and infrastructure application.
EH2 cofounder and chief executive Raffi Garabedian, a former executive at American module producer First Solar, said the company’s approach is designed for the high-volume, low-cost production required to support massive industrial operations.
“This funding round fuels the next phase of our evolution. We’ve demonstrated our enabling core technology, built an amazing team and now have the capital we need to get our technology out into the world and start curbing emissions,” he said.
“Just as importantly, the participation of strategic partners at the forefront of the industries we are poised to decarbonize – energy, mining, logistics, and heavy manufacturing, to name a few – provides vital insight that will facilitate and accelerate our path to market.”
Rio Tinto has already outlined plans to explore the use of green hydrogen in its aluminium manufacturing process, including at its Bell Bay smelter in Tasmania. It has also revealed plans to convert its aluminium operations in Queensland to 100% renewables by the end of the decade.
Rio Tinto chief scientist Nigel Steward said “Rio Tinto is investing in Electric Hydrogen to support the development of emerging technologies with the potential to help decarbonize our operations and supply chains.”
“We produce materials that are increasingly required for our society’s transition to a low carbon future, so it is critical to pursue new ways to work towards net zero in supplying them,” he said.

The 200 MW/400 MWh battery will be installed at Powerlink’s existing Greenbank Substation site in the state’s south-east. CS Energy will install, own and operate the battery energy storage system on Powerlink-owned land.
Powerlink, which will provide connection services in return for access to a range of system support services, described the project as “Australia’s first truly cooperative BESS utilisation and optimisation scheme, partnering a transmission network provider with a generation and retail business”.
Powerlink chief executive officer Paul Simshauser said the battery will support the network operator’s role of guiding the energy transformation in Queensland, while continuing to provide safe, cost effective and reliable transmission services.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the Greenbank battery will help facilitate the continued integration of renewables into the state’s energy system with Queensland targeting 50% renewable energy by 2030.
“The Greenbank battery will be a game-changer in the way we operate the grid and will be critical for soaking up our sunshine and wind to feed into the system when Queenslanders need it,” he said.

Construction of the Greenbank battery is expected to begin in 2023 with the facility likely to commence operations midway through 2024.
The Greenbank project is part of a ‘battery blitz’ announced by the state government in the wake of an explosion at the coal-fired Callide Power Station in 2021 that left nearly 500,000 homes and businesses without power for several hours.
The power outage sparked calls for the introduction of more utility scale batteries capable of providing security for the state’s electricity network and de Brenni said the government is moving quickly to grow Queensland’s energy storage capacity.
De Brenni said the recent national energy ministers meeting had further reinforced the need for large-scale energy storage to support the nation’s energy transition.
“That consensus was to deliver more renewables and storage, and that’s exactly what we’re doing,” he said.
“Queensland’s publicly-owned power companies are already investing in 430 MW of batteries and today’s commitment will grow that capacity to more than 720 MW.”
De Brenni said the state is also installing a series of smaller network-connected batteries across the grid to support operations. Five have already been installed and another 12 batteries, each up to 8 MWh, will be built.

CS Energy chief executive officer Andrew Bills said the Greenbank project marked the generator’s ongoing diversification into new energy sources. The generator last year announced it would build a 100 MW/200 MWh battery near Chinchilla on the Western Downs.
“Adding firm, fast-start generation assets to our portfolio will enable us to more effectively respond to changing demand in the National Electricity Market,” Bills said.
Private developers have rolled out plans for a string of large-scale battery projects in Queensland with Singapore-based developer Vena Energy’s 100 MW/150 MWh Wandoan South project near Wandoan on the Western Downs the most advanced. The project, which is backed by a 15-year power purchase agreement with power producer AGL, is currently progressing through its final commissioning process.
Sydney-based renewable energy developer Genex Power has detailed plans to develop its 50 MW/100 MWh Bouldercombe Battery Project near Rockhampton on the state’s central coast while AGL plans to build a 100 MW/150 MWh battery near Kingaroy.
French renewables developer Neoen is planning to build a 200 MW/400 MWh big battery as part of its proposed 460 MW Western Downs Green Power Hub to be constructed near Chinchilla and has also submitted plans to develop a 100 MW battery project in the state’s far north.

Martin Electrical has been awarded an $11.7 million contract to complete all electrical works for the Edenvale Solar Farm being developed near Chinchilla by Japanese oil refiner Eneos in partnership with Tokyo-based trading house Sojitz.
VivoPower executive chairman and chief executive officer Kevin Chin said the Edenvale project is the largest solar contract for electrical works yet won by the company and will be the fifth utility scale solar farm completed by the company’s Aevitas business in Australia, bringing the completed and contracted solar farms to more than 650 MWdc.
“Since establishing our solar solutions business in Australia, we have seen revenue grow at a 62% compound annual growth rate since FY2019 (based on actual and forecast contracted revenue through to June 30, 2022),” he said in a statement.
“In addition, over the past quarter, we have seen a step change increase in the pipeline of additional solar project opportunities across the Australian market and we are very well positioned to win and deliver on further contracts.”
Construction has already commenced at the 428-hectare site near Chinchilla and once operational, the Edenvale Solar Farm will generate approximately 425 GWh of clean energy per year with the plant expected to be energised in 2023.
The project is the latest solar farm undertaken by J.A. Martin in partnership with lead contractor Grupo Gransolar (GRS). J.A. Martin was also engaged by GRS to complete the electrical works on the 200 MW Blue Grass Solar Farm developed by X-Elio near Chinchilla and the 85 MW Hillston and 39 MWdc Molong solar farms in regional NSW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/27/delorean-goes-back-to-the-future-with-new-ev/,"EV,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 27, 2022",Delorean goes back to the future with new EV,"The DeLorean Motor Company (DMC) has officially revealed its Alpha 5 electric vehicle (EV), a new take on the stainless steel-clad, gullwing-doored sports car that featured in the Back to the Future film series.
The United States-based DMC released images of the new EV earlier this month with the car to have its full debut at the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance car show in California on 18 August, 2022.
DMC has partnered with Volkswagen-backed Italdesign, which helped develop the original DeLorean, to build the Alpha5. The new EV retains some of the iconic design staples of the original DeLorean, such as the low-lying frame, louvres on the rear window and the iconic gull-wing doors.
“The Alpha5 is a representation of the past 40 years of DeLorean,” DMC chief marketing officer Troy Beetz said in a statement. “There was this enormous responsibility to make sure we honoured the history of the DeLorean brand, but an even greater responsibility in curating its future … I think we did both with the Alpha 5.”
Though the original DeLorean became a pop culture icon through its appearance in 1985’s Back to the Future as a time machine, the car’s performance never lived up to its looks. The original company produced only about 9,000 of the cars at its Northern Ireland factory from 1981 before going bankrupt in 1982.
DMC chief executive Joost de Vries said the new “Alpha 5 is for people that love to drive”.
The base Alpha 5 is expected to be built around a 100 kWh battery pack with a range of more than 485 kilometres. The company said the all-wheel-drive vehicle has an electronically limited top speed of 250kph and accelerates from 0-100kph in 2.99 seconds.
As a nod to the film series that made the car iconic, DMC also lists the time it takes for the Alpha 5 to accelerate from 0-88mph (140kph) – the speed needed to achieve time travel in the movie – which clocked in at 4.35 seconds.
The car, which now seats four instead of two, is not going to be cheap with reports suggesting the base model will be priced at about $250,000 (US$175,000). It is expected limited production of the vehicle will begin at DMC’s Texas facility in 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/27/2021-snapshot-australias-distributed-pv-and-storage-uptake/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",,"JUNE 27, 2022",2021 snapshot: Australia’s distributed PV and storage uptake,"Australia has been witnessing tremendous growth in the renewable energy, indeed clean energy is now the fastest growing part of the energy sector. There was a time when people seriously doubted the ability of renewables to make a significant contribution to the country’s electricity generation. However, today renewables play a major role.
In 2021, 32.5% of Australia’s electricity came from clean energy sources; an increase of 5% compared to the previous year. In light of that high rate of progress we can say that a future where Australia’s electricity costs less, is more reliable and has zero emissions is looking more like a certainty than a possibility.
Small-scale solar has a great share in the growth. Of Australia’s total renewable energy generation in 2021, small-scale solar makes up 24.9%, second only in renewable energy behind wind.
In 2021, the small-scale sector has added more than 3.3 GW of new capacity, surpassing the previous record set in 2020.
Since Australia has the highest average solar radiation per square meter, it is not surprising it also has one of the highest per-capita installation rates for residential rooftop solar. In 2021, the average size of a rooftop solar system increased to 8.51 kW; this indicates a more than threefold increase in the last 10 years.
Currently, the considerable reduction in the cost of PV modules and inverters has brought solar prices to an affordable level. The rooftop solar revolution is having a significant impact on Australia’s carbon emissions and customers’ electricity bills. In 2021 rooftop solar contributed 7% of the electricity consumed in the National Electricity Market (NEM) and helped reduce Australia’s emissions by over 17.7 million tons.
However, there are some stumbling blocks in the way of continued expansion. The electricity grid is struggling to cope with the rapid expansion of rooftop solar. As a result, authorities in some parts of Australia have imposed export limits and require that PV systems can be remotely disconnected from the grid – both developments that surfaced in 2021.
Export limits and remote system shutdowns have been imposed in an attempt to maintain the stability of the electricity network. The Australian Energy Market Commission has even floated the proposal to charge rooftop solar customers for exporting their excess electricity to the grid.
Despite these limitations, the number of jobs created in the rooftop solar segment has continued to grow. The number of Clean Energy Council accredited installers increased by 13% in 2021. The figure has closely matched that of the rooftop solar industry more widely, with the number of accredited installers increasing in each of the past six years.

Likewise, the installations of battery energy storage systems (BESS) accelerated in 2021. Annual battery storage deployment in Australia exceeded 1 GWh of storage capacity in 2021. According to Clean Energy Australia Report 2022, approximately 34,731 household batteries with a combined capacity of 347 MWh were installed during the year. A total of 1,089 MWh estimated installations were made in all segments, with 30,246 home battery systems. The states of Victoria and New South Wales has reported with the most uptake.
Battery installations are being supported by some state government programs. Most Australian states offer government-backed household battery schemes which indicate the sector’s continued need for additional support to enable households to make switch to renewable energy.
The rapidly growing clean energy industries in Australia will provide thousands of job opportunities in the next few years. Renewable energy now employs more people than the domestic coal industry. Under the AEMO’s Step Change Scenario renewables could employ as many as 46,000 people by 2035.
The solar industry’s growth in 2021 is all the more remarkable given challenges that affected the growth of the industry internationally. Solar’s rate of growth was less than in previous years and below some analyst forecasts. This is likely a result of a number of factors, such as the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on supply chains, production, shipping costs, and lower electricity prices. The policies introduced to limit or even charge rooftop solar for exporting to the grid may also have had an adverse impact of growth.

India’s Natural Battery Technologies has started making lithium-ion inverter batteries for residential and commercial use. They also double as solar energy storage systems. The batteries use lithium ferro phosphate as the cathode material.
The manufacturer offers batteries in storage capacities ranging from 1.5 kWh to 20 kWh, but it can provide other sizes according to customer requirements. The operating voltage can be 12 V, 24 V, or 48 V, meeting the needs for low-scale applications. It can go up further in the case of bigger storage systems.
The batteries provide steady output ranging from 1 kVA to 50 kVA, which makes them ideal for use as uninterrupted power supply systems. They are safe to keep in any setting and can last up to 10 times longer than their lead-acid counterparts.
Natural Battery Technologies also provides integrated battery systems for both residential and commercial usage. The batteries are housed in separate cabinets – the kind typically used in larger energy storage applications. The company offers smaller 1 kVA to 10 kVA grid inverters in combination with solar energy storage systems. The maximum inverter output is around 240 V AC.
