In February, researchers from Melbourne’s Swinburne University, Adelaide University, and the University of New South Wales announced their collaboration with Victoria’s Moyne Shire Council and Western Australia’s Mid West Ports Authority looking into whether the centuries-old technology concept of wave energy could be recast for our new world.

The promise of wave energy is neither new nor mastered. In fact, attempts to harness the ocean’s power document all the way back to 1799. Since then, thousands of patents have been filed and as many inventors risen and fallen. Today, there are about 250 companies tenaciously grappling with the problem, according to Swinburne’s Professor of Fluid Dynamics and project lead, Richard Manasseh.
The first issue wave energy converters face is the nature of wave movements, sucking in and out. “So there’s not a simple and obvious mechanism [to capture that energy], like the turbine,” Professor Manasseh tells pv magazine Australia.
The world is full of inventors though, and many designs have solved this muddle. It is the second hurdle where they fall. “The machines don’t work at all unless they are gigantic,” Manasseh says. “So there’s a mismatch between the amount of capital companies tends to have and the size of what they have to build.”

Precisely how big wave energy converters need to be depends on the “frequency” of the wave in the targeted region. Putting aside issue of needing region-specific adjustments, Manasseh says the converters tend to follow two design patterns, though “they all look totally different, so it’s difficult for people to get their heads around.” For the simplicity’s sake, it is enough to say a single machine may be the size of an eight storey building, extending 25 to 30 metres under the sea.
It could cost anywhere from a few hundred thousand to a few million to build, depending on the design’s sophistication and efficiency.
It’s hardly surprising then that wave energy has stranded many on the shores of financial ruin. The primary reason for that is not because the designs aren’t good enough or the technology unviable. The issue, Professor Manasseh says, is that our current model for commercialising innovations sees governments take a back seat, letting inventors invent and capitalists provide capital.

This pathway doesn’t work for wave energy converters, Manasseh says, because the machines are actually forms of infrastructure, not products. They’re more comparable to highways than wind turbines. “It’s infrastructure that has to be done on a large scale.”
This doesn’t mean the projects have to be paid for by taxpayers, the professor adds, there are many different financial models which could be used – but it does mean that governments need to make the call.
Since its inception, there have been numerous trials connecting wave energy converters to grids across the world. Many of these have successfully generated electricity, but none have stood the test of time.
That is, all but one important exception: where the technology was used for coastal protection. In the northern Basque region of Spain, the Mutriku harbour was regularly damaged during storms before it built its wave energy infrastructure. The Mutriku project looks like a modified sea wall and Professor Manasseh is quick to point out that is not the design the Australian research project will examine.

Why he thinks it’s important though is firstly because the trial uses the technology in a two-fold way, for protection and electricity generation, and because it is an example of a wave energy project being realised through government backing.
A far cry from the blunt technology of a wall, the Australian researchers are looking into using a physics principle called resonance to quell the force of storm waves.
Before we plunge into that concept, build a mental image of a beach in which some 20 or so floating shapes from submerged machines are evenly spaced parallel to the shore. They are not connected, there is no wall or net running between them.
Now we can come back to rather poetic notion of resonance to explain how individual things bobbing in the ocean could be capable of stopping waves.

Oceans have their own frequency; like a pendulum or swing, it rocks to and fro at a unique pace. Most of the world’s wave energy converter designs tap into this. Engineers can tune wave energy converters like giant musical instruments to have roughly the same natural pace or frequency as the ocean swell, Professor Manasseh says.
“When these frequencies are similar, the machine’s movement becomes very large. It is like pushing a child on a swing: we instinctively push only when the swing reaches at the end of its travel,” he adds. “The arc through which this resonating swing then moves can become very large, and certainly larger than the distance you extend your arms.”
“Likewise, the resonating wave-energy converter moves much more than the water around it, representing wave energy extracted from an area of ocean much larger than the physical size of the machine.”

Using resonance, converters maximise the energy they draw from the wave. The other side of this is that by dropping the machines slightly out of resonance, it would be possible to deflect waves by breaking their rhythm.
“Spaced the correct distance apart, [the machines] can effectively function as a wall without touching.”
“Integral to what we are doing is the word: control,” Professor Manasseh says. That is, controlling one fleet of machines well enough for them to be used for two radically different purposes.
“When there’s a storm with potential for a disaster, you probably don’t care at all about generating electricity during that time, so you could potentially operate these machines in a completely different way where you’re not actually extracting power from waves at all, but you are deflecting the waves.”
“If the primary imperative is protecting the coast, it’s not how efficient your electricity generation is, it’s how well you can control the machines.”

Given this, it’s clear wave energy could be as much the domain of governments and stakeholders as of entrepreneurs. Which is why Victoria’s Moyne Shire Council and Western Australia’s Mid West Ports Authority are supporting the Australian research project with both funding and with personnel.
“With wave energy having significant impact on the operations at Mid West Ports, we are eager to work with Swinburne on this research project to identify options that could potentially have dual benefit to our coastline and the operating environment at the port,” Mid West Ports Authority Acting CEO Damian Tully says.
The $2 million project is also being supported by a $436,000 grant from the federal government through the Australian Research Council. While the granularity of the study and the scope of its partnerships are unique, its findings will remain on paper for now.
During its three year evolution, Swinburne researchers will undertake a mathematical modelling exercise to find how well different machine types couple together. Sometime towards the end of this year, they will give those numbers to their control engineering collaborators at Adelaide University.
In Adelaide, the team will start to derive modes of operation, looking at the machine’s electricity generation mode versus its wave blocking modes and tuning their individual settings.

The coastal engineering team at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) will then build lab models, essentially dioramas, to simulate how it works while also looking at the movement of sediment. The results of these lab models will then be compared to the predictions generated at Swinburne and Adelaide universities.
At the end, the team is hoping to have a sound understanding of how much such dual purpose project would cost, how much it could save governments and corporations by protecting coastal assets, and how the machines’ modes could be balanced.
The question of how well the machines survive in gnarly ocean conditions remains further down the road. Plus, the 250 odd companies playing in the space are already moving to find answers there.
“There’s been a lot of tech push from the entrepreneurial community over the past 40 plus years, and there’s been fundamental studies similar to ours, but no one has looked at what we’re looking at before: combining power generation with coastal protection and trying to control it,” Manasseh says.
More than $226 billion of Australian assets are exposed to coastal erosion and flooding, with the cost to protect these assets expected to increase. While the question of whether wave sizes will increase with climate change is a complicated one and depends on the hemisphere, it is agreed extremes will become more common, meaning coasts will need all the protection they can get.

The service station, to be built opposite Viva Energy’s Geelong refinery, will also include 150 kW electric vehicle (EV) charging facilities.
Last year, Viva Energy announced its strategic alliance with hydrogen vehicle maker Hyzon, saying it would work with the US headquartered company, which has its roots in hydrogen fuel-cell technology, to deliver a complete turn-key hydrogen transport solution for Australia. 
It seems Viva’s service station project, which is expected to cost a total of $43.3 million, is a continuation of this broader Geelong hydrogen and clean energy hub transition process.

The service station is also expecting in time to add traditional diesel refuelling on-site “to allow drivers to witness FCEV charging,” ARENA said. 
The agency added that locating the project adjacent to the Geelong refinery provides a number of benefits, including a high level of visibility from its proximity to major arterial roads and its location within an existing industrial area. It also has access to high voltage infrastructure and to recycled water from the nearby Barwon Water recycling plant, which will be useful for the production of renewable hydrogen.
On top on that, ARENA’s $22 million that just keeps on giving will help subsidise the purchase and operations of 15 hydrogen FCEVs, it said.
Toll Group, ComfortDelGro Corporation Australia, Cleanaway and Barwon Water have all committed to purchasing hydrogen FCEVs for their fleets which include prime movers, wastewater and municipal waste collection vehicles and buses. These FCEVs will be owned by the companies, though ARENA said it will give its funding portion “upon the delivery of the vehicles.”

ARENA CEO Darren Miller described Viva’s New Energies Service Station as “Australia’s first publicly available hydrogen refuelling station to independent fleets.”
“The experiences of Viva Energy and fleet vehicles using the renewable hydrogen produced onsite for refuelling will provide valuable insights into the operation of different types of hydrogen FCEV heavy vehicles,” Miller added.
“This project will be a key opportunity for early uptake of commercially viable hydrogen and a service station model that could be replicated across Australia as the price of electrolyser technology drops.”
ARENA has previously given $3.1 million in funding to support Toyota’s Hydrogen Centre which also has a green hydrogen refuelling centre feeding in from its 200 kW electrolyser. Like Viva’s project, it is also focussed on demonstrating the molecule’s potential in transport.

Poseidon H2, its marine arm, today announced it has brought in two engineers, Peter Mastalir and Kevin Morgan from consultancy Dynamic Efficiency to “lead the development of an emissions-free pleasure craft.”
The company says the pair are now looking at taking the hull of an existing pleasure craft and “redesigning the fit out.”
“Initially, we will be following a rigorous 10-month research and development process, then commence building the most commercially viable option,” Mastalir said. “We intend to use existing technologies as much as possible, which is why we are looking to use an existing hull design with a unique upper deck and internal layout.”
Poseidon H2 is owned by Liberty Energy Capital Pty Ltd, an Australian investment firm with “significant positions” in 18 primarily hydrogen focused companies, including H2X Global, Patriot Hydrogen, Aviation H2, Sweetman Renewables, Verdant Earth Technologies, Port Anthony Renewables Limited, and more. Liberty Energy Capital says it’s poised to have a $490 million equity in renewable energy companies across Australia over the next three years.
Branding itself as a renewable energy investor, Liberty Energy Capital’s portfolio is noticeably heavy on biomass-to-hydrogen projects, holding almost every company which has biomass-based projects in Australia. Biomass is not zero emissions technology. 
Liberty Energy Capital holds a 30% stake in Pure Hydrogen, a somewhat misleading name given the company owns three gas projects, including the Windorah Gas Project in the Cooper Basin, one of Australia’s most prolific onshore petroleum basins.
On its website, Liberty Energy Capital say it is “100% owned by Sirius Capital Pty Ltd, itself owned by a group of Family Office’s”. Strange grammar and punctuation aside, family offices usually refers to private wealth management advisory firms that serve ultra-high-net-worth individuals. 
In November last year, Liberty’s Aviation H2 came out with a very similar announcement to today’s news, saying it had appointed a team of engineers to fast-track the building of Australia’s first hydrogen-fuelled aeroplane, which it said would be flying by 2023.
Back to Poseidon H2, the company seems to be very much aiming its hydrogen-fuelled boat at everyday punters, labelling it a pleasure craft and not signalling to any utility. 
Many have questioned the potential market acceptance of consumer hydrogen vehicles (be they boats or cars) because they tend to be less efficient and more expensive that electric alternatives. Liberty is nonetheless backing them, with H2X very much focusing on consumer cars in its current vehicle rollout which is expected to continue unveiling new models throughout this year. 
“Our number one goal is to build a better boat, it just happens to be that it will be powered by hydrogen. The brief is to ensure it has an equivalent operational range, requires less maintenance and is cheaper to run than traditional fuel sources like diesel,” engineer Mastalir said.
The company says it is confident it will be able to create a model that allows for a new top to be seamlessly installed onto a repurposed hull. Once commercialised, it says it will lead to “quick uptake by significant players” as the “majority of the infrastructure for a carbon-free boat is already at hand.”
Both engineers have been appointed to Poseidon H2’s board.

State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), which operates roughly 80% of the nation’s electricity grids spanning across 26 provinces, has unveiled plans to massively expand its battery storage fleet and pumped hydro storage capacity and thus help the nation move towards its decarbonisation goals.
SGCC Chairman Xin Baoan said Wednesday in a commentary published in the state-owned People’s Daily that SGCC aims to have 100GW of battery storage by 2030, up from 3GW today. This is a very ambitious goal, given that BloombergNEF forecasts that all of China will have about 96GW of battery storage by 2030.
Under a five-year plan released this week, China is aiming to slash battery storage costs by around 30% by 2025, paving the way for local industries to dominate the global market by 2030. In addition, the fifteenth five-year plan drafted by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the National Energy Administration (NEA) gives special attention to compressed air storage and envisages that this technology will realise engineering applications in units of 100MW of capacity.
But SGCC’s plans don’t end only with battery storage, the grid operator is also planning to increase its pumped storage capacity from the current 26.3GW to 100GW by 2030. This builds on its announcement in January when it said it had commissioned the world’s largest pumped-hydro facility. Located in Hebei province, the 3.6GW Fengning Pumped Storage Power Station consists of 12 reversible pump generating sets with a capacity of 300MW each and has a power generation capacity from storage of 6.612 billion kWh. To put SGCC’s plans into perspective, China is targeting 120GW of operational pumped-hydro facilities by 2030, according to the NEA.
Beyond storage
Furthermore, Xin said that SGCC is also planning to increase its cross-provincial power transmission capacity and support the buildout of solar and wind in the western desert areas. Finally, he said the grid operator will also seek to implement flexible DC transmission, virtual power plants, safety and stability of large power grids, and ultra-high voltage tap-changers, among other technologies.
According to Xin, SPCC made these plans to align with the Chinese government’s dual carbon goal to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. China’s decarbonisation policy has already created pressure on state-owned enterprises mandating energy storage with the order to build renewables-plus-storage projects introduced for the very first time by the NEA last April.
In terms of supporting policies, NEA, the country’s major energy policymaking authority, has already launched a series of incentives and advisory documents with an eye on the interim goal to deploy 30GW of energy storage capacity by 2025. In addition, several provinces have also released policies supporting storage for renewable energy installations.
But despite its decarbonisation plans, China continues to account for a great share of global coal additions. A recent report published by three environmental think tanks and lobbyists finds that China is home to 55% of the world pipeline for new coal facilities and, together with India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Turkey, and Bangladesh, jointly accounts for 82% of plans for new coal plants.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/01/building-a-sustainable-vertically-integrated-solar-manufacturing-ecosystem-in-india/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"MARCH 1, 2022","Building a sustainable, vertically integrated solar manufacturing ecosystem in India","From pv magazine India
The Indian solar manufacturing sector must strive for building a sustainable, vertically integrated ecosystem, rather than focusing solely on output, says a new report by JMK Research and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
India, which targets 300GW of installed solar power generation capacity by 2030, has a PV cell manufacturing capacity of 4.3GW and a module manufacturing capacity of 18GW. The actual output is even lower as most of these manufacturing facilities have been operating below their nameplate capacities at a capacity utilisation factor (CUF) of 40-50% or less.
The nation has been a laggard in manufacturing not just upstream PV components such as wafers and cells but also modules.
In comparison, China accounts for about 61% of the global solar module manufacturing capacity of 358 GW. India’s manufacturing capacity of 18GW is roughly equal to the annual capacity addition of the top individual Chinese PV brands, a comparison that shows the vast scope for Indian companies to match their economies of scale, states the report.
For raw materials, Indian manufacturers rely on imports mainly from China and face associated risks of shortages and price hikes. This highlights the need for a sustainable, vertically integrated domestic solar manufacturing ecosystem.
“Without large-scale domestic manufacturing, from raw materials through to modules, the overarching risks of logistics and commodity price fluctuations for imports will persist,” says co-author Vibhuti Garg, Energy Economist and Lead India, IEEFA.
The report notes that the ambitious PV installation target, coupled with government support, has made the prospects for indigenous photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing increasingly vibrant. Dozens of companies are vying to make a mark in the Indian solar sector.
The Government of India’s Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for integrated PV manufacturing with an initial outlay of INR 4,500 crore (US$616 million), plus the additional allocation of Rs19,500 crore (US$2.5 billion) in Budget 2022, would have the combined potential to produce at least 40GW of solar modules.
Co-author Jyoti Gulia, Founder, JMK Research, says: “The PLI scheme alone, if judiciously implemented, can increase the integrated solar module, cell and wafer domestic manufacturing capacity several times over in the next three to four years.
“This will help in creating a huge demand potential for the PV ancillary market – solar glass, ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), etc – and skilled workforce. The direct investment in the country on account of PLI budget expansion would potentially rise to about Rs90,000 crore (US$11.5 billion).”
Among issues before the Indian industry are the relatively low capacity utilisation in factories producing solar cells and the type of solar cells being produced. The majority of domestic production (60-70%) employs multi-Si module technology – which is nearing obsolescence.
New major manufacturers who are planning to expand or enter the market aim to install machinery to produce mono-Si modules, the prevailing technology. This development will aid domestic players in competing with global rivals on quality and price.
The Indian PV industry also faces mid- to long-term challenges of high manufacturing expenses, inadequate research and development (R&D), and a shortage of skilled manpower.
Garg says, “Developing significant manufacturing capacities in raw materials, especially polysilicon, will be highly capital intensive and technologically complex. Domestic manufacturing companies need to have a proactive technology partnership with innovators or research institutes.
“Rather than focusing solely on output, it’s imperative for the domestic solar manufacturing industry to create a strong foundation for sustainable development overall.”
