The state government said the initiative, which will provide up to $275 million (USD 180 million) of funding in the initial round, will support workers, small businesses, manufacturers and innovators to take advantage of the transformation of the energy grid.
NSW Premier Chris Minns said funding will be available for the manufacturing of renewable energy components including solar generation, energy storage technology and hydrogen electrolysers.
Funding will also be available to help businesses get scalable low-emission technologies market ready and to increase manufacturing capacity of low-carbon products.
“This is all about supporting and backing NSW businesses, manufacturers and innovators to develop homegrown technology and products right here in the state,” Minns said, adding that the grants would help create “the jobs and skills we need for a renewable energy future.”
The state government said the focus of the initiative will be “lab-proven technologies and the manufacturing of market-ready products that are ready to be scaled-up and rolled out across NSW.”
Sectors to be targeted include future energy systems and storage, transportation, built environment, biomanufacturing, power-fuels including hydrogen and agricultural technologies.
NSW Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said the initiative will support the delivery of the state’s renewable energy zones (REZs) and hydrogen hubs, giving them access to more materials produced in NSW.
“NSW is undergoing a transformation of our energy grid,” she said. “These grants … will give NSW security and sovereignty of the renewable energy supply chain.”
The NSW government has legislated to reduce carbon emissions by 50% on 2005 levels by 2030 as part of its long-term goal to achieve net zero by 2050.

The agreement provides UHH, owned by Turnbull family company Wilcrow Pty Ltd, with access to WaterNSW land around Glenbawn Dam, near Scone, and Glennies Creek Dam, near Singleton, for the purpose of designing pumped hydro schemes. Both dams collect water from the Hunter River.
UHH will also study an option to incorporate a wind farm into the design of the pumped hydro plants.
If the studies are successful, UHH will fund, build, operate and own the pumped hydro projects under a long-term lease agreement.
UHH Director Malcolm Turnbull, a strong advocate of the Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project during his time as prime minister, said the planned Upper Hunter projects will be much-needed additions to Australia’s emerging suite of long-duration energy storage projects which are required to offset the retirement of coal-fired generation.
Turnbull said the projects could deliver dispatchable power with long-duration storage of more than 1,000 MW for 8-12 hours and provide the critical firming capacity required to optimise renewables.
“Wind and solar are both intermittent sources of generation and once coal fired generation is phased out, we will be left with abundant, and much cheaper, variable generation but no continuous, baseload generation,” he said.
“That’s why long-duration energy storage in the form of pumped hydro is critical to ensuring energy is affordable and reliable.”
According to current plans, the Glenbawn Pumped Hydro project will have a capacity of 770 MW with 10 hours (7,700 MWh) of storage duration. The Glennies Creek project has a capacity of 620 MW and 10 hours (6,200 MWh) duration.
UHH said both projects are located in strong areas of the National Electricity Market (NEM) and well placed to utilise the new transmission capacity being developed as part of the planned Hunter-Central Coast Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).
The projects are currently in the early conceptual design stages but UHH is seeking to have them ready for construction in approximately four years, with the projects operational in the early 2030s.
Should they proceed, UHH estimates the combined projects could potentially generate 1,400 construction jobs, and 80 ongoing operations roles.
WaterNSW Chief Executive Officer Andrew George said the projects are the latest in ongoing efforts to grow sustainability initiatives and identify renewable energy generation and storage opportunities on the corporation’s land and assets.
“We have an opportunity to not only assist the transition to a renewable energy power grid, but to also assist in the creation of jobs, support the local community, and generate revenue to put downward pressure on water costs for customers,” he said.
“We are continuing to assess sites across our portfolio to identify further opportunities.”
The UHH projects are the second projects to be announced under WaterNSW Renewable Energy and Storage Program following the announcement of ACEN Australia’s proposed Burrendong pumped hydro project in December 2022.

2,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/26/demand-sites-join-big-batteries-in-making-most-of-new-fcas-markets/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,2024-02-26,Demand sites join big batteries in making most of new FCAS markets,"Smart grid technology company Viotas said commercial and industrial demand sites like cement mills, cold stores and data centres can play a key role in the contingency frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) market as Australia deals with the flexibility issues that can arise from more renewables.
Contingency FCAS services have traditionally been provided by generators such as coal and gas plants but Paul Moore, Managing Director of the Australian arm of Ireland-headquartered Viotas, said demand response is perfectly suited to help address the challenge of keeping the power grid balanced as variable generation increases.
“In the traditional grid you had more seconds to respond to a contingency event (such as a generator tripping) but these days, with more renewables, the frequency changes very quickly,” he said. “This is due to a reduction in the rotating mass in the grid as thermal plant close down.”
To address the need for speed, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) introduced two new contingency services into the National Electricity Market (NEM) during Q4 2023, with the Very Fast Raise Contingency (R1S) service and the Very Fast Lower Contingency (L1S) markets commencing operation on 9 October 2023.
“Providing increasingly faster response required for these new markets to support increasingly renewable energy based grid is inherently hard,” Moore said.
“So far it’s only been big batteries and demand response that are capable of doing it.”
AEMO’s latest quarterly analysis of the Australian energy markets shows that batteries and demand response were the main providers of the very fast services, increasing their shares of FCAS market supply to 50% and 12% respectively in the December quarter. Virtual power plant (VPP) was the only other technology supplying this service.
Moore said the introduction of the new very fast markets – which require a one-second response time – has been a game-changer for the demand response sector, opening up new avenues of revenue generation.
In the first quarter of the very fast FCAS markets operation, the NEM-wide average price for one-second contingency raise was $18.3 per MWh, the highest out of all the FCAS services for the quarter, followed by one-second contingency lower at $18.1 per MWh. This trend has continued into Q1 2024 with even higher prices in R1S.
Moore said most of the value of the FCAS market has already shifted into that one-second response time.
“It’s following the trend that we saw in Ireland,” he said. “As more and more renewable energy comes into the grid, the value in the stability services moves to the faster-acting services.”
“About 95% of value is now in R1S, there’s another 2% in R6S, and the remainder sits across the slower two markets.” The slower markets being R60s and R5m.
Moore said Viotas, which opened its first international office in Melbourne in 2020, has just over 40 MW registered in the one-second markets and approximately 40 MW registered in each of the other three FCAS markets.
“All of our MWs are on-demand sites, industries like cement mills, data centres, cold stores and so forth,” he said, noting that the interconnected and locally controlled sites are able to respond within milliseconds of a change in grid frequency being detected.
“Our proprietary kit will detect that frequency drop locally and automatically trigger the response.”
“We are also looking at the viability of large-scale solar farms (1 MW and greater) at demand sites also participating in the market.”
It is that rapid response time that is paving the way for demand sites to participate in the very fast FCAS market.
“A lot of industrial customers have a perception of demand response as needing to shut down equipment for the afternoon, minutes to hours at a time, but Very Fast FCAS is very different,” Moore said. “The outage is actually a very short duration, and very infrequent. With most of the revenue in the 1-60 second timeframe, you can leverage the service without any interruption to your plant operation in many cases.”
The success of the very fast FCAS services has prompted speculation that the market operator will introduce even faster markets, something that Moore said is possible.
“We’ve seen it happen in other jurisdictions, even from the time they announced the new market to actually implementing it, it got faster,” he said. “So it’s not a giant leap to suggest or speculate that there’s likely to be faster responses in future.”

3,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/26/gfg-signs-green-hydrogen-deal-for-whyalla-steelworks/,"HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,2024-02-26,GFG signs green hydrogen deal for Whyalla steelworks,"Having earmarked $593 million (USD 389.3 million) of public funding to build a green hydrogen power plant at Whyalla on the east coast of the Eyre Peninsula, the South Australian government has now announced it has reached an agreement with GFG Alliance to explore opportunities for hydrogen offtake from the facility.
The Hydrogen Jobs Plan facility, due to become operational in 2026, is to comprise a 250 MW hydrogen electrolyser – to be powered by large-scale wind and solar – and a 200 MW hydrogen power plant.
South Australia Premier Peter Malinauskas said the green hydrogen will be stored and used at the site to fuel the power station but could also be made available for local industry offtake.
“We got our own customer for the hydrogen that we produce, that would be the power plant itself,” he said. “But if there is the opportunity to enter into a commercial offtake agreement, to realise the green iron and green steel opportunity, then we want to grab that too.”
Malinauskas said the agreement with GFG Alliance commits to exploring opportunities for a green hydrogen offtake deal with commercial negotiations to secure the supply now progressing.
“This agreement provides a roadmap to decarbonisation,” he said.
British billionaire Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG Alliance last year announced plans to phase out coal-based steelmaking and decarbonise its operations at its Whyalla Steelworks, signing a supply contract for a low carbon electric arc furnace.
The company has also engaged equipment suppliers to install a 1.8 million tonne a year direct reduction plant, which will process local magnetite ore to produce low-carbon iron for use in the electric arc furnace.
This plan will initially use a mix of natural gas and renewable hydrogen sourced from the Hydrogen Jobs Plan facility, before fully transitioning to green hydrogen as it becomes available at scale.
South Australia Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis said the move to “green steel” represents a new chapter in Whyalla’s steelmaking history, and hydrogen produced at the nearby Hydrogen Jobs Plan facility is poised to play a key role in this transition.
“GFG’s capital investment in this green transformation program is exactly the type of project we hoped to help make possible through our Hydrogen Jobs Plan,” he said.
“The benefits will be clear to see – we will help safeguard and modernise our steelmaking assets for the long-term while providing good local jobs and forging a hydrogen-powered industrial renaissance.”
The government has forecast that the design and construction of the Hydrogen Jobs Plan facility will help “accelerate South Australia’s green hydrogen industry, unlock the development of a $20 billion pipeline of renewable energy projects and catalyse the creation of new jobs in the supply chain industries.”
The announcement of the green hydrogen agreement came on the same day that GFG Alliance revealed it is also in talks with oil and gas giant Santos for an expanded gas supply agreement to the Whyalla steelworks.
The agreement could see GFG Alliance become the first domestic third-party customer for Santos’ carbon capture and storage project at Moomba.

4,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/26/renewed-push-on-agrivoltaics-could-help-resolve-conflict-in-rural-communities/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",JONATHAN GIFFORD,2024-02-26,Renewed push on agrivoltaics could help resolve conflict in rural communities,"There are increasing signs that negative sentiment towards wind, utility-scale solar, and electricity transmission projects in regional Australia is growing. National Party leader David Littleproud reported that he is seeing division in rural communities over renewable energy and grid expansion projects.
“It’s visceral out here at the moment. People want alternatives,” Littleproud said, in an interview with the Australian Financial Review. “There are families that don’t talk to each other.”
The National’s leader attended a community event near Orange in New South Wales (NSW) earlier this month and reported heated debate.
“It was pitting neighbour against neighbour,” said Littleproud. “The people who put the wind towers on their place get paid, but the neighbours have the transmission lines going over and get their property devalued.”
Littleproud and the Nationals appear to be grappling with what position to take on Australia’s energy transition and have proposed an expanded rooftop PV and energy storage program, “repurposing” funds set aside by the Labor government for large-scale projects.
Others appear to be “whipping up concern”, said Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen on 8 February. The Rally Against Reckless Renewables on 6 February saw genuine community concerns come together with a range of anti-science conspiracy theories. Former Nationals’ leader Barnaby Joyce and Littleproud both spoke at the event.
Missing from the recent debate, it appears, is how solar and renewable energy projects can work in harmony with agriculture and rural communities.
Large-scale solar can compliment food production through agrivoltaics. Additionally standalone power systems (SPS) deliver reliable, clean power to rural proerties, while doing away with costly rural electricity networks, which can be the source of bushfires.
The Clean Energy Council’s 2023 agrivoltaics’ report argued that it presents a sustainable model preserves agricultural productivity, demonstrating a promising future for co-development in utility-scale solar projects and farming practices. It can capitalise on the synergies between solar energy generation and agricultural production.
The report said the integration of solar energy and agriculture, known as agrivoltaics or “agrisolar”, presents a promising avenue for enhancing land use efficiency. It has gained some traction in Australia, the CEC reported.
Solar grazing, in particular, has proven beneficial in Australia. Sheep grazing among solar module rows can help maintain vegetation growth and enhance land productivity. Operations and maintenance costs, for the solar project owner, can also be reduced – representing a mutually beneficial arrangement.
Solar farms offer additional advantages for agriculture, including improved animal welfare by providing shelter and reducing exposure to elements and predators.
Studies have shown that solar farms can create microclimates that are conducive to livestock health, evidenced by lower mortality rates among lambs and higher wool quality during adverse weather conditions.
“These solar grazing farms have the potential to reduce twin merino lamb average mortality rate from 20% in open paddock to 12% within the panel field,” says the CEC.
Research has also found that partial shade from solar panels can promote biodiversity, support bee populations, and improve conditions for certain horticultural practices by moderating temperatures, enhancing soil moisture, and facilitating plant growth under or around the panels.
Beyond ground-mounted solar systems, agrivoltaics encompasses a variety of configurations such as elevated PV panels that allow for cultivation underneath, solar greenhouses using semi-transparent modules, and floating PV systems suitable for aquaculture.
While these applications are currently more common on a smaller scale due to technical and financial considerations, The CEC says they represent potential growth areas for agrivoltaic innovation.
While conflicts between renewable energy development and rural communities may be growing, it must need not be inevitable.
For example, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) estimates that NSW “will need approximately 20,000 MW of large-scale solar generation to replace coal-fired power stations by 2050.”
These projections would only be an allocation of approximately 0.06% of its rural land to meet its large-scale solar generation targets by 2050.
