Developed by the South Australia-headquartered Lumos Digital Mining, the 5 MW data centre will be used to mine bitcoin, a type of cryptocurrency that requires energy-hungry computers to solve complex maths equations for financial reward.
Lumos co-founder and chief executive officer Dong Wang said the facility is powered by renewable energy sourced from the 5 MW Tregalana Solar Project, co-developed by Melbourne-based investment agency Climate Capital and South Australia-headquartered renewable energy developer Eyre Power.
The Whyalla cryptocurrency mining operation uses 100% of the energy generated by the behind-the-metre Tregalana project, with any remaining power requirements to be met through the grid.
Cryptocurrency production has attracted widespread criticism for the amount of energy it uses but Wang said the operation provides the developers of the Tregalana Solar Project with a guaranteed base load, ensuring the project is financially viable.
Wang said output could also be increased to utilise surplus energy from different sources when electricity generation exceeds demand, offering a solution for renewable energy project developers who are dealing with curtailment issues.

“Renewable energy projects are already not being allowed to connect to the grid due to curtailment and others are suffering heavy losses when they switch off at times of low consumption,” he said.
“We keep using the power 24/7 and that’s a huge benefit to the renewables developers, it makes their projects more financially viable.
“We are basically like a sponge. We soak up the excess that’s not used.”
Wang said cryptocurrency production can also eliminate the need for developers to deploy battery energy storage systems to absorb excess generation, describing the mining operation as “digital storage”.
“Because we are a mining farm we don’t need storage,” he said. “Crypto mining offers a way better and cheaper solution than battery storage. Battery power is only released one or two times a day. Digital mining is a 24/7 business, and this is not just for mining cryptocurrency. We can provide a cloud service, we can provide a computing service for Google, for Apple, for any of the large server companies.”
Wang said the company has already been talking with other energy generation project developers about retrofitting crypto mining facilities to help them overcome curtailment issues.
“We are hoping to sign up more PPAs to assist more renewable projects in the future,” he said. “We are in discussions with some larger developers. If they can retrofit our mining facilities, then we can free up their generation.
“This represents how we transform the negative NEM price into digital storage and assets.”

The Whyalla operation has the potential to mine at least 100 bitcoins in a year but Lumos intends to increase the size of the mining facility with construction of a 10 MW solar farm expected to commence in “a couple of months”.
Wang said the facility would be built beside the existing 5 MW Whaylla Solar Farm which was developed by Lumos’ sister company Southern Sustainable Electric (SSE).
The output of the Whaylla Solar Farm, which was commissioned in 2018, is sold on a merchant basis by the Melbourne-based SSE but the planned 10 MW facility would be used to power an expansion of the crypto mining operation.
“We aim to build the most prominent renewable digital mining business in Australia by utilising thriving sustainable energy resources,” Wang said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/03/victoria-tips-in-10-million-to-tackle-solar-panel-waste-challenge/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 3, 2022",Victoria tips in $10 million to tackle solar panel waste challenge,"The state government-owned company Breakthrough Victoria has announced a new Challenge program which will see it invest up to $10 million to support the development of new and improved technology to recycle or reuse solar panels, that would otherwise become waste.
With more than three million rooftop solar installations across the country, including more than 600,000 installed across Victoria, an estimated 187,000 tonnes of solar panel waste are expected to be generated in the state by 2035.
Victorian Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said there are currently limited options available for managing and recycling solar panel waste, but there are increasing opportunities to recover valuable materials from panels that can no longer be used and develop new products and markets for them.
“Our Solar Waste Challenge is an example of how we are working with industry and innovators in our nation-leading clean energy transition, while proactively addressing potential environmental impacts,” she said.
Breakthrough Victoria, which manages a $2 billion fund set up by the Victorian government to drive investment in research, innovation and commercialisation, is calling for “novel, commercial and scalable solutions” that create high-value products from end-of-life solar panels, reducing the number of panels going to landfill and increasing the return from the panels through clean separation technology.
Breakthrough Victoria chief executive Grant Dooley said innovations may include new separation and recycling technologies, collection and logistics developments and ways to maximise harvesting of materials to create new, high-value products.
“We are looking for innovators to solve the issue of solar panel waste well before it becomes a much bigger problem,” he said.
“The Breakthrough Victoria Challenge encourages solar and recycling experts across the spectrum of science, technology and infrastructure to look for creative solutions to unlock value in solar panel disposal and recycling.”

One of the challenges the solar industry faces is the retrieval of valuable components like silicon and silver, which can be potentially harvested and repurposed for other industry applications. Dooley said improvements in technology have the potential to increase the value of recovered waste materials as waste volumes grow exponentially.
“It’s clear that investment in alternative waste management solutions is needed to develop the technology to generate value in solar recycling,” he said.
“End-of-life solar panels embody the circular economy challenge the industry faces, but also the opportunity of turning a waste stream into a commercial product and creating a strong market for the solar panel recycling industry.
“This is a first step in helping accelerate and scale up a commercially viable system of solar panel recycling in Victoria.”
Solar panel recyclers and innovators seeking investment can apply for funding by submitting a proposal through Breakthrough Victoria’s official Challenge page.

BEI said the sheep have been introduced to explore the ways grazing can replace mechanical methods to maintain vegetation growth on the south block of the solar farm near Geraldton in the state’s mid-west.
BEI general manager Tom Frood said the company is trialling the technique in the hope of maximising the environmental and safety benefits at the 244-hectare facility and the decision to locate sheep onsite has already shown promising early signs.
“Sheep grazing is a natural way to manage vegetation growth, enabling the area to be productive agricultural land, minimising risk to solar equipment caused by vehicle mowing and reducing bushfire risk by keeping fuel loads consistently low,” he said.
The Greenough River trial is not the first time sheep have been co-located with renewable energy sites in Australia with more than a dozen solar farms exploring the potential of the concept. And while it provides free lawn mowing and reduces the site’s fire risk, the benefits also extend to the graziers.

BEI pointed to a project in the New South Wales’s Central West where farmers running sheep on solar farms reported improved quantities and quality of wool production.
The farmers reported the shade and condensation run off from the panels can increase grass compared to surrounding paddocks, a finding that aligns with research suggesting solar panel microclimates can increase water retention, and grass production.
Researchers in the United States have found that the partial shade offered by solar panels creates a microclimate that reduces evaporation and significantly boosts the production of vegetation in arid climates.
Researchers at Oregon State’s College of Agricultural Sciences found that areas that were partially or fully covered by solar panels increased their biomass production by 90%.

The project will also include a 200 MW/200 MWh battery energy storage system.
In a regulatory filing, ACEN said the project would be funded using “any combination of equity, credit support, guarantees and other similar arrangements”.
ACEN, a subsidiary of Philippines-based Ayala Corporation, said it has already authorised its Australian subsidiary to enter into PV module supply agreements for the Stubbo Solar Farm with construction expected to commence later this year.
The project, which was granted development consent by the state government’s Department of Planning and Environment in 2021, will comprise an estimated 800,000 solar modules mounted on single-axis trackers spread across a 1,250-hectare site about 10 kilometres north of Gulgong, approximately 115km east of Dubbo.
The facility, which will be located within the planned Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone, will connect to the National Electricity Market (NEM) via TransGrid’s 330 kV Wellington to Wollar transmission line which transects the project site.
When complete, the Stubbo Solar Farm will generate more than one million MWh of solar energy, enough to power more than 150,000 homes and helping to reduce carbon emissions by at least 600,000 tonnes per annum.

The Stubbo project is one of several that ACEN has in its Australian pipeline, including the 720 MW New England Solar Farm and co-located potential 200 MW/400 MWh battery being built near Uralla in central NSW, the proposed 600 MW Birriwa solar farm and battery project also in NSW, the 160 MW Axedale Solar Farm in central Victoria, and a share in the 250 MW Baroota pumped hydro and 300 MW Bridle Track solar projects in South Australia.
The financial commitment comes just days after ACEN Australia announced it had executed an agreement with the Sydney branch of global financial group MUFG for an up to $140 million loan facility to support the continued development of its large-scale renewable energy projects in Australia.
The parent company is seeking to grow its renewables capacity in Australia and the broader Asia-Pacific region to 20 GW by 2030. ACEN said this week it currently has about 4 GW of attributable capacity in the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, India and Australia.
That total has received a boost in recent days with ACEN following its financial commitment to the Stubbo Solar Farm with the approval of the company’s investment in a trio of solar project in the Philippines, including the 237 MW Giga Ace 8 solar power project in the country’s Zambales region, the 208 MW Naredco solar power plant project in Cagayan, and an investment in a 60 MW solar plant in Pangasinan through the acquisition of Sinocalan Solar Power Corp.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/03/new-insurance-facility-to-speed-up-low-carbon-hydrogen-projects/,"HYDROGEN,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"OCTOBER 3, 2022",New insurance facility to speed up low-carbon hydrogen projects,"From pv magazine Global
Insurance company Marsh has announced the launch of a first-of-its-kind insurance and reinsurance facility to provide dedicated insurance capacity for new and existing low-carbon hydrogen energy projects. The insurance broker is already in talks with clients, and said that it expects the facility to streamline the financing process.
The simplification of project insurance will accelerate hydrogen developments throughout the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Oceania.
“Dependent on the project’s timeline, we hope the first attachment to the facility would  be signed before the end of the year,” Marsh Global Hydrogen Practice Leader Mark Heneghan told pv magazine. “If not, in early 2023.”
Generally, insurance brokers have to individually negotiate each insurance clause and condition, along with lender endorsements, on behalf of their clients. Marsh’s facility includes them all directly, eliminating the need for continual negotiations. It also focuses on small- to medium-sized projects.
“The facility is not designed for mega projects. We are looking at the smaller end of the scale. The contract value is somewhere in the region of $500 million to $600 million or below,” Rob Hale – Marsh’s London market leader, power and renewable energy practice – told pv magazine. “Those are the operations we are targeting with this facility.”
The London-based team of the global insurance broker modelled the facility around its understanding of non-recourse project finance. They focused on all of the clauses and conditions needed to make projects bankable from an insurance standpoint. The launch marks the culmination of a 12-month process, including calls with potential clients and internal meetings through different regional offices.
“Rather than going through a normal placement process, which could take several months, the facility should be able to provide that solution very quickly, enabling either the sign-off of all the lender endorsements and agreements or, if any negotiation with the lender is required, you can have it early,” said Hale.
Similar risk-transfer programs are needed, as insurance is part of the required documentation to access financing. The insurance only kicks in when the project construction starts.
The facility is global, but it will not focus on China and Russia for now, according to the company.
“Chinese projects typically have a lot of capacity within the domestic market space, and they tend to insure home-grown projects locally,” Hale said, adding that projects in Russia are not on the table now, due to international sanctions. “One day maybe, if the sanctions are lifted.”
The facility also targets “clean hydrogen,” which does not necessarily mean blue or green hydrogen.
“If the project is outside the norm, additional discussions with the facility markets would be needed,” said Heneghan.
Marsh expects the facility to gain momentum in the months and years ahead. As more projects are insured, more information is generated about risks to be covered by insurance, simplifying the whole process and streamlining hydrogen projects.
However, it is too early to speak about possible market share, according to Marsh. The company noted that there will be plenty of opportunities for other insurance organisations in the coming years, especially after 2030. 
“Globally, US$13 trillion needs to be invested by 2050 – that is an extensive amount of capital expenditure that has to happen,” Heneghan said. “We are now at around US$500 billion to US$700 billion dollars announced by 2030, so much more still needs to be done.”

Jakson has revealed plans to move into solar cell production and expand its PV module capacity. The Indian solar manufacturer and developer says it will expand its cumulative module capacity to 1 GW in five to six months, from 500 MW at present. It aims to have 2 GW of cumulative, operational cell and module capacity by the end of 2024. 
The company also has ambitious plans for green hydrogen, green ammonia, and electrolyser production. It is now in talks with leading alkaline electrolyser technology suppliers to start electrolyser production under a joint venture. 
“Jakson has a very concerted focus on green hydrogen and green ammonia production, and fuel cells for mobility as well as energy needs,” Bikesh Ogra, chief executive officer of Jakson, told pv magazine at the Renewable Energy India Expo 2022 this week. “We have plans for utility-scale green hydrogen and ammonia production down the road. And we are in discussions in multiple Indian states and geographies outside India, wherein we would like to get into utility-scale green hydrogen and ammonia production.”
Green hydrogen is challenging in terms of transportability and storage at the utility scale, which is why Jakson is also looking at distributed-generation green hydrogen and on-site ammonia. It believes this will be far more economical and practical. In this space, the company is exploring biomass gasification-based green hydrogen generation projects with an individual capacity of 2.5 tonnes to 5 tonnes per day.
