The bids are among the first to be launched as part of the federal government’s Capacity Investment Scheme unveiled last year. The scheme will underwrite new zero-emissions storage in Australia, including big batteries, hydrogen, and pumped hydro, to incentivise and accelerate projects as coal plants rapidly retire. Essentially the scheme will see the federal government pay revenue shortfalls based on a pre-agreed floor value, guaranteeing projects baseline income. If revenues exceed an agreed price ceiling, the government will take a share of profits.
In terms of the Victorian and South Australian bids, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) will conduct the two-stage tender process. In a joint release, the federal, South Australian and Victorian governments noted the draft term sheets and detailed tender timelines will be released in the coming weeks, with registration for the tender to open in September.

Projects that have reached Final Investment Decision since the Capacity Investment Scheme, or CIS, was announced in December 2022 are also eligible for support, the governments noted. 
Projects will be assessed on their ability to support reliability at the lowest cost while ensuring increased capacity is delivered in both jurisdictions. The announcement also pointed out the states are interconnected, meaning both jurisdictions will benefit from storage on either side of the border.
The Victorian and South Australian tender appears to have been fast tracked, with the federal government formerly flagging announcement dates in October.
This tender is additional to an expanded tender currently running in New South Wales (NSW). In June, it was announced that a partnership between NSW and the Commonwealth governments would boost a 380 MW firming tender, organised as part of the NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap, to 930 MW. The more than doubling of the tender target came as a result of Commonwealth Capacity Investment Scheme funding, underwriting an additional 550 MW of firmed capacity for NSW.
Overall, the Capacity Investment Scheme is seekingto unlock an estimated $10 billion (USD 6.6 billion) in private and public sector investment in new dispatchable storage and generation across Australia.
The national rollout of the Capacity Investment Scheme in 2024 will include further auctions in Victoria and South Australia.

The new partners will initially pursue solar and battery projects, including:
Desert Springs Octopus says it will pursue a near-term investment of $1 billion (USD 650 million) into grid connected renewables along the Darwin-Katherine Electricity System. 
Despite its natural resources, the Northern Territory massively lags Australia in terms of its renewable energy penetration. This is due to a number of factors, including the Territory’s historic and continuing reliance on gas, an adverse regulatory system for renewable projects and higher costs since renewable industries have not yet reached scale.
Coming back to Desert Springs Octopus, the company says funding for the projects will come from a mix of wholesale, impact and institutional investors. Presumably the partners will also use the two new investment platforms set up by Octopus Australia last year, known as OREO and OASIS.
Green hydrogen projects will also be part of Desert Springs Octopus strategy in the NT, the company said – though no timelines have been given for this.

Desert Springs Octopus (DSO) has renewable energy Benefit Sharing Agreements with the Larrakia Nation and Jawoyn Association underlying the partnership.
Octopus Australia’s Managing Director, Sam Reynolds, previously told pv magazine Australia the DSO in fact formed at the behest of Bevan Mailman, now the Co-Chairman of Desert Springs Octopus, as he was looking for a renewable partner. That is to say, the Octopus Australia component frame themselves as taking the passenger’s rather than driver’s seat, seeing their role as learning from and listening to Indigenous groups and communities.
This approach Reynolds frames as fundamental given the history of First Nations communities and lands being exploited. Octopus Australia’s former Investment Director of Energy Markets, Lumi Adisa, who worked on Desert Springs Octopus during its formation described the endeavour as building a new kind of business culture based on trust and respect.

Adding to this point, Reynolds previously noted First Nations communities can be understandably skeptical of businesses coming in and making promises. “They’ve seen a lot of people like me,” Reynolds said last year. “There’s a big history we need to get through.”
Reynolds is referring here to historic mishandling by mining and resource companies in Australia. As renewable energy rapidly becomes a dominant industry in Australia’s regions, there are fears and some red flag this history may again be repeating itself.
CEO of Northern Territory Indigenous Business Network, Jerome Cubillo, however described the Desert Springs Octopus and Larrakia and Jawoyn partnership as “a lighthouse model for others to follow.”
“This is what real economic self-determination looks like,” Cubillo said.
“We believe that starting with Benefit Sharing Framework Agreements is the key to strong and enduring relationships with Indigenous communities, and we are proud to partner with Jawoyn and Larrakia Nation,” Reynolds said.
“We are looking forward to being a genuine partner in this exciting project that aligns with our values of protecting and caring for Country,” CEO of Larrakia Nation, Michael Rotumah, aded. 
The Larrakia and Jawoyn communities are connected to large swaths of Country around Darwin and Katherine, the equivalent to 25% of the UK land mass. This includes Australia’s closest major port to Asia, one critical for hydrogen export.

On Wednesday, the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) released the final recommendations from its review of smart meters, advising the roll out be prioritised but also more tightly regulated to improve customer experiences.
Specifically, the AEMC recommended new obligations be placed on retailers to provide “customer friendly” information prior to meter installations, adequate notice regarding any tariff changes, and a mandate on customer access to real-time data free of charge.

Its proposal suggests energy networks should lead a coordinated national rollout by developing a legacy meter retirement plan, with retailers overseeing upgrades to smart meters.
The recommendations also include the development of a communications strategy for the rollout to inform and assist consumers with their choices, and support for vulnerable customers with premises requiring remediation before a smart meter can be installed.
In its announcement, the AEMC flagged its independent review found that reaching a penetration of 100% of households by 2030 would provide net benefits to the value of $507 million for national electricity market regions, including New South Whales (NSW), Queensland, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and South Australia (SA).
More broadly, it deemed a quickened rollout would reduce household bills in the short-term and provide savings for all energy users in the longer-term. That is, the widespread uptake of smart meter technology would “pave the way” for advances necessary to reach net zero enabling the development of a two-sided energy market.
While smart meters offer consumers more opportunities when it comes to using and paying for energy, AEMC Chair Anna Collyer noted the current pathways for replacing smart meters have not necessarily led to positive experiences for all customers. “People deserve transparency and timely information about how they can make the device best work for them,” she said.
“Today’s final recommendations aim to address key customer pain points by providing better notice ahead of tariff changes to prevent “bill shock”, as well as guidance for customers about how they can use tariffs to save on their power bill.
Even though smart meters enable accurate time-of-use pricing, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) found “a lag in the uptake of time-of-use pricing with large differences between regions” in its Inquiry into the National Electricity Market report in May 2022. 
Despite the slow uptake, pilot programs have launched across Australia using smart meters as a mechanism to deliver load control or demand response services. In the south coast of NSW, a program launched in 2021 which uses smart meters to trigger the heating of hot water systems in periods when there is surplus solar power in the grid – in a sense creating a low-tech Virtual Power Plant (VPP) or energy storage system that doesn’t have additional hardware and software requirements.
While the program focuses on electric hot water systems, it could also be applicable for electric vehicle charging, batteries or other forms of load control.
The AEMC said its final recommendations take in feedback from extensive consultation with stakeholders and it will now work with energy advocacy bodies on next steps in the rule change process.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/30/consumer-group-debunks-residential-battery-misconceptions/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,RESEARCH,GERMANY,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"AUGUST 30, 2023",Consumer group debunks residential battery misconceptions,"From pv magazine Germany
As electricity markets fluctuate and energy prices rise, households are increasingly seeking self-sufficiency with rooftop PV systems and batteries. About 70% of new residential systems in Germany now include home storage. However, not all claims about battery storage use are accurate.
In order to counter false expectations, Verbraucherzentrale NRW has clarified the five main mistakes that could be made when buying a residential storage system.
1: Battery storage cannot be installed at a later stage
This is not true. Verbraucherzentrale NRW said that integrating battery storage later is achievable with a hybrid inverter in a PV system. Retrofitting is also feasible with a conventional inverter, even after many years of PV system operation.
2: The larger the battery, the better
“This is wrong,” the consumer group said. Although battery storage systems are still expensive, they should not be oversized for economic purposes. As a rule of thumb for the appropriate size of storage, they said that every 1,000 kWh of annual electricity demand justifies 1 kWh of storage capacity. In other words, with an annual electricity demand of 5,000 kWh, a storage system should have a capacity of 5 kWh. Consumers should also consider the size of a PV system and remember that rather small systems rarely produce enough surplus power to charge large battery storage.
3: You can always save money by using battery storage
“This is another misconception,” the association said, noting that residential batteries still have high upfront costs. This is only the case if the sale of excess solar power into the grid over the estimated service life is higher than the purchase cost of the battery. Verbraucherzentrale NRW offers calculations and estimates as to whether the savings to be expected are higher than the purchase price.
4: With a battery storage system, electricity can be stored in the summer for the winter
Some battery providers use this narrative to advertise their products. Verbraucherzentrale NRW said that the residential batteries that are currently available on the market can only be used to shift excess solar power for consumption in the evening or at night, with no seasonal storage being possible.
5: With battery storage, users always have electricity and are independent of the power grid
Verbraucherzentrale NRW, which is based in in North Rhine-Westphalia, provides a resounding “no” in response to this. Households remain reliant on the technical connection to the public grid, even with PV systems and storage. In cases of power failure, standard photovoltaic systems and home storage systems cease to supply energy unless equipped with an emergency power or backup system, an addition that Consumer advocates estimate to cost between €500 ($540) and €2,000.
“It is important to be aware of the personal goals of using photovoltaics in conjunction with battery storage and then to obtain comprehensive information,” said Stefan Hoffmann, an energy analyst at Verbraucherzentrale NRW.
In March, Verbraucherzentrale NRW warned about a series of myths that consumers should know when buying residential PV systems.
“It is important to be aware of the personal goals of using photovoltaics and then to find out more. In this way, disappointments can be avoided and solar power can be used really efficiently,” said Sören Demandt, a digital energy transition analyst for Verbraucherzentrale NRW.

OGL will handle ocean shipping from several offshore ports, arrange customs clearance, container unloading, warehouse and materials management, and transportation into the site for both the 5 MW Werris Creek Solar Farm in NSW and a 5 MW solar farm project at Moree, also in NSW.
The two new projects build on OGL’s portfolio of successfully delivered solar farm projects across Australia’s east and west coasts. In Fiscal Year 2022/23, the company delivered 16 solar projects representing 1.6 GW capacity across five states in Australia.
These recent projects were for major EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) contractors and OEM suppliers within the renewable energy industry and ranged from several 5 MW solar farms to a 340 MW AC large scale Solar Farm in NSW, where OGL arranged both offshore shipping/freight forwarding and end-to-end delivery of the solar trackers and modules.
OGL also arranged the delivery of a battery energy storage system (BESS) and racking system, including a Dangerous Goods Declaration for the ocean shipping of the 5 MW / 7.5 MWh Longwarry BESS for a leading EPC Contractor in Victoria , along with a similar project delivery in West Australia.
To help accommodate its growing solar farm logistics business capability, OGL has expanded its office network with the purchase of a new office in the Brisbane central business district to house its Project Logistics Team, which specializes in solar, renewables, and construction related projects. OGL also expanded its new joint venture 13,000 SQM warehouse and transport operation with MTAW Logistics in Brisbane.
OGL also has operations in Melbourne, Perth, Sydney, Adelaide, and Toowoomba.

UK car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover says it is partnering with Wykes Engineering to build large-scale stationary energy systems based on second-life lithium-ion batteries from its I-PACE electric vehicles.
The system will store renewable energy coming from unspecified wind and solar plants, the company said, noting that it will have a storage capacity of 2.5 MWh.
“The batteries supplied have been taken from prototype and engineering test vehicles, and JLR aims to supply enough batteries to store a total of 7.5 MWh of energy – enough to power 750 homes for a day – by the end of 2023,” the company said.  “After this point, more containers can be created to house additional second-life batteries removed from used production vehicles in the future.”
The I-PACE battery, developed in collaboration with Switzerland-based Pramac, has a storage capacity of 90.2 kWh. Weighing 610 kg and measuring 2,280 mm x 1474 mm x 300 mm, the battery has retained 70% to 80% of its original capacity, according to Jaguar Land Rover. The company emphasised that no extra manufacturing processes or battery module removal is necessary.
The company said that that every battery is linked to an inverter to optimize energy production.
“Its advanced engineering makes the I-PACE battery perfect for second-life, and even third-life, applications in low-energy situations once battery health falls below the stringent requirements of an electric vehicle,” Jaguar Land Rover stated. “Once the battery does finally come to the end of its usable life, it is 95% recyclable.”
