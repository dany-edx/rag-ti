While the generation capacity of the BIPV system has not been revealed, Melbourne architecture firm Kennon said when complete, the array will supply almost enough power to cover all of the building’s energy needs. With extra solar panels set to be deployed on the roof, the building is expected to have almost no ongoing power costs and will be carbon-neutral after a few years.
Architect Pete Kennon said the BIPV installation will be capable of producing 50 times the energy of the average residential rooftop solar PV system and will eliminate 70 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions each year.
Kennon said the Spencer Street building would pay off its carbon debt and “actually be carbon neutral”, without relying on offsets and other accounting measures.
“These things are possible and the fact a building can harness the sunlight from its own skin – it sounds like something you dreamed of, or you saw in a cartoon,” he said.
The Spencer Street building will be fitted with a solar skin comprising 1,182 Skala thin-film solar modules supplied by German manufacturer Avancis, a subsidiary of Chinese state-owned company China National Building Materials (CNBM).
Designed for use in ventilated curtain wall systems, the Skala panel measures 1,587mm x 664mm but Avancis said each module can be adjusted in length and mounted in either portrait or landscape mode. The copper, indium, gallium, and selenium (CIGS) product comes in power classes from 110W through to 140W with an efficiency of up to 13.3%. Using 3.2mm tempered glass, the module weight comes in at about 17kg and is available in nine colours, ranging from black and greys, through to blues, greens, gold and bronze.

Project manager Neoscape said the Spencer Street project is the first building approved by the Building Appeals Board of Victoria to use an integrated solar facade system.
The Melbourne-based Neoscape said the design had been approved after satisfying rigorous Australian Standards of Construction in safety, including comprehensive integrated fire testing of the facade system, detailed fire engineering reviews and reports, and endorsement by Fire Rescue Victoria.
“This will set a new benchmark in ESD (environmentally sustainable design) for commercial office buildings, allowing integrated solar facades on buildings across Victoria,” the company said.
The Building Appeals Board said in its compliance assessment that the thin-film modules are proposed to be deployed on all elevations of the building from level 2 to level 7.
“In most parts of Australia, the largest consumption of energy occurs in the cooling of buildings, so we designed the facade to face a solid panel north covered in the solar panel and a clear-vision glass panel south optimising the effect of the solar panel whilst minimising the heat gain through direct sunlight,” Kennon said. “This enables a maximum thermal comfort within the building using the solar to run the building with zero carbon emissions.”
Due to be completed in 2023, the Spencer Street building is among a growing number of commercial projects that are pursuing sustainable technologies and innovations as the property sector looks to play its part in Australia achieving its net zero target by 2050.
Australian property investor and developer Cbus Property has revealed plans to clad a 49-storey office tower being developed in Melbourne’s CBD with a BIPV facade capable of generating 20% of the project’s base building electricity requirements. The $1 billion project is expected to be completed in 2026.

Another Melbourne highrise is already earning plaudits for its solar system, with Verergy announcing at the weekend that Walker Corp.’s Collins Square Tower site in the city centre has been named as a finalist for the Master Electricians Australia 2022 Electrical Industry Excellence Awards.
Venergy integrated a 223kW rooftop solar system with the building’s regenerative lifts and its trigeneration of 600kW gas turbines across five commercial towers, bringing the site’s total generating capacity to 2MW.
The Adelaide-headquartered solar installer said the project has been recognised as the finalist in the categories of Energy Efficiency Project of the Year Award and Commercial Project of the Year Award.
Figures published by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) show buildings are responsible for 40% of the world’s carbon emissions and use approximately 40% of the world’s energy. The majority also have substantial carbon footprints, employing heavy use of fossil fuels across their lifetimes, from their construction, use, and demolition phases.
Kennon said that sustainable construction methods and a sustainable future in the built environment had been a driver behind the design of the Spencer Street building.
“We want this building to be a symbol of innovation and sustainability of how the built environment can be part of the climate solution,” he said.

Rystad Energy senior analyst David Dixon said the Kidston facility, located about 270 kilometres north-west of Townsville in northern Queensland, had spearheaded the state’s dominance of the utility PV generation performance.
“The top six utility PV assets for the month were all located in Queensland which benefits from better solar resource at this time of year relative to the southern states,” he said in a Linkedin post.
The Kidston Solar Farm, which also topped the charts in April, is part of the planned Kidston Clean Energy Hub, which is to include a 250MW/2GWh pumped hydro energy storage facility while up to 270MW of additional solar and up to 150MW of wind generation have also been proposed.
The 100MW Clare Solar Farm, a 50:50 joint venture with Melbourne-based fund manager Lighthouse Infrastructure and German counterpart DIF Capital Partners, was the second-best performing utility PV asset last month with a 21.6% CF. Melbourne-based renewables developer Pacific Hydro Australia’s 100MW Haughton stage 1 solar farm (21.5% CF) rounded out the top three.

While Queensland assets dominated the utility PV market, Dixon said at the state level, New South Wales was the top performer, generating 819GWh of utility-scale solar and wind power for the month, followed by Victoria (747GWh) and South Australia (547GWh).
“May 2022 ends with all Australian utility PV and wind assets generating 2,932GWh, up from 2,678 GWh (+9%) the same time last year,” he said.
Dixon said with the inclusion of rooftop solar, Australia had surpassed the milestone of 30GWac of operational PV in May.
The best performing utility wind assets for the month were the Stockyard Hill 1 wind farm (44.9% CF) in Victoria, followed by Badgingarra (42.6% CF) in Western Australia and the Kiata wind farm (42.5% CF) in Victoria.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/06/supermarket-major-reaches-milestone-in-rooftop-solar-rollout/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 6, 2022",Supermarket major reaches milestone in rooftop solar rollout,"Having committed to power all of its Australian operations with renewable energy by the end of 2025, retailer Woolworths Group has added another supermarket to its solar network with a 100kW PV array installed atop the roof of Woolworths Conder in the Australian Capital Territory.
Woolworths said in a statement the system, comprising 222 solar panels spread across a 500 square metre area, has the capacity to generate more than 145MWh of renewable energy each year – the equivalent to more than 25 Australian households’ annual electricity consumption.
Woolworths Green Energy Transition general manager Michael Shelley said the solar expansion will aid the group’s transition to 100% green electricity by 2025, supplementing the electricity provided to the retailer through partnerships with renewable energy companies.
“In recent years we’ve been on a mission to roll out solar panels on supermarkets across the country,” he said. “We’re committed to doing our bit to bring about a better tomorrow.”
The Canberra store is the 150th Woolworths supermarket now generating energy from solar power. The retailer said it has an established solar network on supermarket rooftops that totals almost 80,000 panels, generating enough electricity to power 6,300 Australian households.  It also has installed rooftop solar across more than 20 other properties, including distribution centres.
The network offsets an average of 13% of the energy consumption of the stores it’s installed on, boosting the group’s efforts to cut total emissions by 63% by 2030.

While the solar program is aiding Woolworths’ ambition to source 100% renewable energy by 2025, the group is continuing to sign supply agreements with large-scale wind and solar developers, having recently announced its operations in South Australia will be powered entirely by renewables from July this year after it signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Australian arm of Spanish energy group Iberdrola.
Under the new energy partnership, from July Woolworths will source renewable electricity from Iberdrola Australia’s newly developed Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park, where 210MW of wind with 107MW of solar will work in tandem to supply approximately 100GWh of renewable electricity per year on the retailer’s behalf.
Woolworths chief executive officer Brad Banducci said the scheme is aimed to drive down Woolworths’ carbon footprint.
“South Australia will be the first state where every one of our sites are powered by green energy,” he said. “South Australia has helped lead the transition to renewable energy in Australia, combining solar, wind and batteries to enable us to make this leap forward in our mission to be powered entirely by renewable sources by 2025.”
Woolworths also announced that from July it will begin drawing on additional green energy from the 224MW Bango Wind Farm in the New South Wales (NSW) Southern Tablelands under a partnership with CWP Renewables that will provide enough renewable energy to power more than 100 supermarkets.
Woolworths has signed a 10-year agreement with CWP Renewables with the power purchase agreement (PPA) to cover about 30% of Woolworths’ NSW energy needs.
Woolworths said it will gradually replace non-renewable energy contracts in other states across Australia by 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/06/victoria-boosts-battery-funding-after-state-first-storage-solution-switched-on/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 6, 2022",Victoria boosts battery funding after ‘state first’ storage solution switched on,"The 110kW/284kWh Yarra Community Battery – which is expected to shift the way solar power is being utilised in the community, ultimately paving the way for more renewable energy to be integrated into the network – began charging with solar PV energy immediately after it was unveiled in the inner Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy North on Sunday.
Spearheaded by the not-for-profit Yarra Energy Foundation (YEF), the estimated $1 million Yarra Community Battery will soak up excess rooftop solar generated locally before sharing the renewable energy with a subnetwork of nearly 200 properties.
The 110kW/284kWh battery will charge at times of the day when there is low electricity demand or when local rooftop solar systems are exporting into the network. Power from the battery can then be used later in the day when demand is high and solar systems are no longer generating. YAF said the battery will reduce emissions from electricity use, reduce demand on the electricity grid, absorb and redistribute excess solar energy, and share renewable energy across the entire subnetwork, not just homes with rooftop solar.
YAF community battery project manager Chris Wallin said it was the “first generation of community batteries” and will allow the wider community access to both store and use renewable energy.
“It stores energy during the day and supplies in the evening peak, to reduce emissions from coal and brown coal generation,” he said. “Its purpose is environmental in a financially sustainable way.”

Supplied by Norwegian manufacturer Pixii, the 110kW/284kWh PowerShaper system features lithium-ion battery modules manufactured by Swedish company Polarium and includes Pixii’s Gateway monitoring and control applications. Pixii said the “muscle” in the system is the Pixiibox 48/3300, a bi-directional 3.3kW AC/DC converter module. Melbourne-based retail Acacia Energy has been engaged to operate the community battery using its cloud-based Optimisation and Bid Engine (OBE) platform.
State Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said the Yarra Community Battery, which received $800,000 funding from the state government’s $11 million Neighbourhood Battery Initiative, is “a demonstration about how we can return power and energy back to communities, back to neighbourhoods”.
D’Ambrosio on Sunday announced more than $2.3 million extra for the Neighbourhood Battery Initiative, saying the program would supercharge the clean energy transition in communities across state.
The initiative has already provided nearly $4 million in grants with batteries being built in the Melbourne suburb of  Tarneit and the regional communities of Phillip Island and Yackandandah. Round 2 of the program is now open for applications.

The Energy Minister said the goal of the government is to prove community batteries can become more than a pilot or demonstration.
“They can be a mainstream feature of the way that we make our own energy as a community and how we share it when we need it the most,” she said.
“Neighbourhoods across Victoria will soon have batteries, not only helping slash carbon emissions and energy prices but letting communities be part of their transition to clean energy.”
Community battery energy storage systems have been growing in popularity in Australia, with the Yarra community battery the first of a series of community-scale batteries YAF plans to install across the inner-city suburbs.
Melbourne city council has also announced its intent to install a network of co-ordinated community batteries at council sites across the city while schemes are also being rolled out in New South Wales and Western Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/06/reaching-beyond-efficiency-limits/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JUNE 6, 2022",Reaching beyond efficiency limits,"From pv magazine Global
So-called “hot carrier” solar cells (HCSCs) offer one theoretical path to conversion efficiencies beyond today’s theoretical limits. By isolating and capturing energy from particles carrying excess kinetic energy that is usually lost as heat, the concept promises cell efficiencies well beyond 30%, even for a single junction device.
The theory has been around for several decades, but so far, no hot carrier cell has been successfully fabricated. The “imperfections” that would limit practical performance of such a device, in comparison to models of what is theoretically possible, are not well understood.
Scientists led by Japan’s University of Tokyo investigated the resilience of HCSCs to these “non-ideal” scenarios, and introduced a “hot carrier multijunction solar cell” (HCMJ) as an approach that modelling showed could be less vulnerable. They described the research in “Hot carrier multijunction solar cells: sensitivity and resilience to nonidealities,” which was recently published in Journal of Photonics for Energy.
While the model showed the HCSC as having the highest efficiency potential, the HCMJ demonstrated a lower drop in performance when other non-optimal designs were used. They also model performance of the cells under different light and temperature conditions, and were able to widen the list of materials potentially suitable for hot carrier devices.
“Hot-carrier photovoltaics have been proposed since the early 1980s as a way to achieve higher efficiencies that break the conventional ‘detailed-balance’ limit, but they have yet to be realised in practice,” explained Sean Sheehan, editor-in-chief of the journal that published the research. “The work by Giteau and colleagues provides a strategy to bring them closer to fruition by loosening the constraint of near-perfect materials, which otherwise easily reduces the performance of real-world devices.”
