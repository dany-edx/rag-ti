It is the announcement of a technology target which is entirely outside the government’s control: solar PV electricity at a cost of $15 a MWh.
That price translates to 1.5 cents per kWh, a tiny fraction of the 20 to 30c/kWh currently being paid by Australian households. Most of the price households pay consists of charges for transmission, distribution and retail services.
The Australian government cannot deliver (or even significantly obstruct) this target, any more than Australia, acting alone, can much effect the global climate.
But it’s easy to see Mr Morrison is on safe ground in setting ultra-cheap solar photovoltaic electricity as his goal.
That’s because the world is almost there.
Long-term solar power supply contracts in many countries are being settled at prices of less than $0.02c/kWh and prices are continuing to fall.
Reductions in the cost of solar modules, inverters and the like are being driven by a massive global industry, with an annual turnover of more than $200 billion a year, and correspondingly huge research and development budgets.
The programs announced this week might help to accelerate progress a little, but they are part of a massive global effort.
Equally critical, and less subject to government control, is the global decline in long-term real interest rates which are now zero or negative, even over terms of 30 years, more than the expected life of a solar plant.
A zero real interest rate, combined with near-zero operating costs means a solar plant only needs to generate enough electricity over its lifetime to pay for its initial installation cost.
Utility-scale solar can now be installed at a cost of less than $1/watt or $1,000/kW.
In favourable locations, such as those in most parts of Australia, solar cells can deliver the 2,000 hours of full power per year, over a lifetime of 25 years. That’s 50,000 kWh, implying a cost of A$0.02 c/kWh.
We can expect to see such prices appearing in contracts very soon, as the ultra-low cost of capital is factored into calculations of returns. Technological progress will get us the rest of the way to Morrison’s target.
This remains about as true even when we take account of the need for energy storage, to ensure electricity generated at the midday supply peak can be shifted to meet the demand peak in the early evening and to meet the much lower night-time need (sometimes called “baseload”). The costs of batteries are declining in the same way as solar cells.
What are the implications for the Australian coal industry? It’s already clear new coal-fired power is uneconomic in competition with solar and wind power, and most countries have stopped commissioning new generators.
The exceptions, including those in China, reflect the desire of provincial governments to keep capital investment going, rather than a calculation of costs and benefits.
But as the price of solar falls, even the existing paid-for plants will become uneconomic, unless the price of coal falls drastically.
The arithmetic is brutal. One tonne of high-grade thermal coal is sufficient to generate 2-3 MWh of electricity.
In a market where the price is set by competition from solar at $15/MWh, that would yield revenue $30-45/tonne, out of which has to come the costs of maintaining and operating an ageing coal-power plant, as well as the cost of mining and shipping the coal.
At the moment thermal coal costs in excess of US$180 per tonne.
Add to that the fact China is in the process of introducing a carbon price, and it’s clear the achievement of Morrison’s solar electricity price target will spell the end of thermal coal. A similar analysis applies to gas.
“Green” hydrogen, produced by cheap electrolysis, could do the same for coking coal, as well as undercutting “blue” hydrogen produced from gas.
That won’t happen immediately. In the very short term in places such as China, growth in electricity demand is outpacing installations of solar and wind, pushing coal prices high.
And carbon-free steel is some way off.
When the global demand for coal does declines, it will be higher-cost and lower-quality producers such as those in Indonesia that will feel it before Australia’s.
But the idea Australia will still be exporting significant quantities of coal in 2040 — let alone 2050 — is a fantasy.
The broader story delivered by Morrison (and the right one) is a story of optimism.
Instead of the alarmist scenarios of $100 roasts and economic catastrophe still being pushed by opponents of action, we are at a point where we can safely predict we will have more than enough ultra-cheap, pollution-free electricity to power homes, vehicles and most kinds of industry.
All that’s needed is the courage to embrace it.
It will require more than we have seen from our leaders so far.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/28/horizon-rolls-out-solarstorage-solution-in-states-most-remote-settlement/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 28, 2021",Horizon rolls out solar+storage solution in state’s most remote settlement,"Kalumburu, located on the banks of the King Edward River, 550 kilometres northwest of Kununurra and 650 kilometres northeast of Derby in Western Australia’s Kimberly region, is the most remote permanent settlement in the state.
The community’s only power source to date has been from diesel generators but that is about to change with Horizon Power installing a 700 kW solar farm and a 1.78 MWh battery to deliver a renewable energy supply to the approximately 400 residents.
State-owned utility Horizion Power said the new solution, being delivered by Perth-based solar specialists West Australian Alternative Energy (WAAE), means up to 64% of Kalumburu’s power will be generated by renewable energy.
Horizon said diesel generation will still be required, but the new solar and battery solution will enable the microgrid to run completely on renewable energy during the day, when weather conditions are favourable.
Horizon Power chief executive officer Stephanie Unwin said solar+battery systems have been proven to have a high reliability rate and are well suited to the seasonal weather impacts that often affect energy systems in remote communities.
“Utility-grade energy systems allow remote communities to have improved energy quality, reliability, safety and access to renewable greener energy through increased renewable-hybrid (solar-diesel) systems with reduced CO2 emissions,” she said.
“We are committed to bridging the energy technology gap between metropolitan and regional areas of the state.”
The project marks a milestone for WAAE which is, for the first time, using the PEG racking solution developed by German manufacturer Jurchen Technology.
The PEG system is a high-density low-profile solution which sits on slender galvanized steel bars which have been rammed into the earth. The lightweight construction means no foundations are required, negating the need for concrete.

WAAE said the use of the PEG system has been limited in Australia to date but it provides a unique, simplified solution while the low-profile 8-degree tilt design requires minimal spacing between modules, helping maximize land utilization.
A bankability report by Norway-based technical consultancy DNV GL says the area-related energy harvest per acre is almost the same for either the fixed-tilt or single-axis trackers systems, while the PEG system exhibits a comparative ~117-233% advantage over
The report also highlighted significant CAPEX savings due to the simplistic design of the PEG.
Horizon said construction of the Kalumburu microgrid is scheduled for completion next month, with commissioning to follow through to early next year.
The project is the first of six renewable energy systems set to be rolled out in the Kimberley as part of Horizon’s Remote Communities Centralised Solar Project which will see up to 4 MW of solar PV installed in six remote communities.
The $11.6 million project will see centralised solar and/or battery energy storage systems also installed in the Warmun, Ardyaloon, Beagle Bay, Djarindjin, and Bidyadanga communitites. Warmun is expected to be the next location for construction.
Unwin said the project offers customers a safe, more reliable cost-effective source of power.
“The project will significantly reduce the cost of providing power to these towns, which are currently fuelled 100% by diesel,” she said.
“It will also drive a significant reduction in CO2 emissions by more than 2,000 tonnes per year, which is equivalent to taking 425 cars off the road each year.”

The 50 MW/75 MWh lithium-ion battery has been installed adjacent to Transgrid’s Wallgrove substation in Western Sydney and Lumea anticipates it will deliver important lessons with large-scale batteries expected to play a big role in firming and balancing Australia’s electricity system as the nation moves towards a future energy mix with higher penetration of renewable energy.
Featuring 36 Tesla Megapack units connected to transformers and with a direct feed to the National Energy Market (NEM), the lithium ion battery energy storage system will trial the use of ‘synthetic inertia’ as a service as well as provide grid support and system strength to the energy network.
Lumea said the Wallgrove battery will demonstrate how batteries can be used to respond to a frequency event, and how often it is needed to provide fast-frequency response and system inertia – termed synthetic or digital inertia when delivered by battery storage. It will also demonstrate how batteries can be used as a new source of dispatchable power, how much electricity it is able to store and dispatch under different conditions.
Lumea spokesman Nigel Buchanan said the battery will also be monitored to see how it responds to frequency deviations that occur as a result of incidents on the network.
“High-speed monitors on the network pick up the data and we expect to see a very fast, anticipatory response from the battery,” he said.
Buchanan said current batteries work retroactively, so that when frequency spikes or drops and moves outside a particular frequency band, then the battery is triggered and provides active power into the network to rectify the frequency deviation.
New technology in the Wallgrove battery is expected to detect a change in the property of the electricity flowing in the network.
“We’ll be monitoring to see how well the battery anticipates that withing half a second that the frequency will have moved outside the particular band and automatically kicks in to arrest that change and hopefully moderate the frequency deviation and head off the incident,” Buchanan said.
“The point is we already know that Australia can build synchronous condensers for hundreds of millions of dollars, but we want the data from Wallgrove to say, batteries do work as an alternative, preferable solution.”

Modelling by TransGrid and Lumea suggests within the next energy market regulatory period, between 2024 and 2029, New South Wales is likely to need 240 MW of battery inertia to address the gap left once fossil fuel generators are retired. At 50 MW the Wallgrove battery will go some way to helping.
“What we are proving with the Wallgrove battery is the complementarity of the battery’s role not just for market solutions such as energy storage and dispatch, but a simultaneous role for network operations such as inertia,” Buchanan said.
“When these batteries are operating in ‘inertia mode’, it’s literally less than a second up to no more than six seconds, but you need a huge amount of power for that very short period.
“What that means is we can provide those short bursts without interrupting provision of other market services.”
The Wallgrove Grid Battery is expected to be fully operational in early 2022.
TransGrid will own and maintain the battery while Iberdrola, which also operates the Lake Bonney big battery in South Australia, will provide commercial services to the energy market, including dispatch control and FCAS and wholesale energy markets.

In December 2020, the arbitrator, High Court Chief Justice Robert French, found that the subsea cable failure was not a force majeure event and was instead caused by thermal overstressing arising from Basslink’s operation of the 370-kilometre high voltage, direct current interconnector which connects Tasmania’s transmission system with the mainland.
As part of that arbitration outcome, French awarded the state and Hydro Tasmania more than $70 million relating to the failure of the interconnector and ordered Basslink to undertake a number of actions to improve the operational performance and reliability of the cable.
Following that decision, the state government and Hydro Tasmania entered into a Standstill Agreement with Basslink that preserved the rights of the parties and created a framework for negotiations to take place on commercial and engineering matters, while Basslink attempted to refinance its debt and meet its commitments.
In May 2021, the state and Hydro Tasmania agreed to extend the Standstill Agreement but when that agreement expired on Wednesday, Tasmanian Energy Minister Guy Barnett said the state government would not offer another extension.
Barnett said negotiations and mediation attempts had failed and Basslink had not satisfactorily progressed actions required to improve the cable’s operational performance and is yet to pay the more than $70 million as required by the arbitrator.

“For nearly 11 months, Tasmania has acted in good faith in the hope that a resolution could be found, including extending the standstill agreement in May this year,” Barnett said in a statement.
“However, the award payments to the state and Hydro Tasmania remain outstanding and (Basslink) has not adequately progressed the commercial and engineering requirements. It has also failed to secure refinancing.
“The government believes that further negotiations are unlikely to lead to a satisfactory resolution and the current situation cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.
“The state and Hydro Tasmania will now pursue their legal rights.”
Basslink described the government’s decision to return to the courts as “a deeply regrettable development”.
“We have been making progress on the various arbitration award matters in good faith and in a responsible manner … The announcements therefore come as a surprise,” the company said in a statement.
Basslink said the interconnector continues to operate efficiently and reliably, connecting Tasmania to the National Electricity Market (NEM) and the company would continue to engage responsibly with the state and Hydro Tasmania to come to a resolution.
Barnett said he was confident the legal action would not impact the state’s energy security and Basslink would operate as normal, transferring energy between Tasmania and Victoria.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/28/dragonscale-solar-tiles-installed-on-google-buildings/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 28, 2021",Dragonscale solar tiles installed on Google buildings,"From pv magazine USA
One of Google’s newest buildings is using a building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) product called Dragonscale, which is manufactured by European solar panel company SunStyle.
And it is gorgeous.
The internet giant, which also is a world-leading clean energy procurement company, has installed around 7 MW of the product on two buildings at its Silicon Valley campus. The 90,000 individual solar panels will generate enough electricity to cover around 40% of the electricity used in the buildings, known as Bay View and Charleston East.
The solar cells are embedded into a sturdy, but flexible, polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) layer. Six millimeters of hardened solar glass protects the face of the panels; the back is protected by a layer of fire-resistant Tedlar (polyvinyl fluoride). Because the edges of the tiles are sealed to keep out moisture — much like a glass-glass solar panel — aluminum framing on the panel is not necessary.
The polyvinyl layer is a highly textured “prismatic” surface, which traps photons within the solar panel that would normally escape from traditional flat solar panels. The result is an increase in solar panel generation.

Technically, if we were to only install one of the panels it would have an efficiency of 15%. That is because the standard shingle doesn’t have a solar cell in the top square due to the product’s overlapping nature. But when we take into account the overlapping configuration, the effective efficiency rating is closer to 17%, which is what the company lists on its website.
 
The solar cells are a standard monoPERC (monocrystalline passivated emitter and rear cell) product. The panels connect with a standard MC-4 type connector and use industry-standard solar inverters.
The company’s specifications list five separate solar panel types, which fit into the border areas of the roof, taking advantage of the entire roof.

Sunstyle shared a .gif on its website to show how the product is installed. The solar tiles are screwed directly into the sun-roof structure. The substructure can be made of wood or stainless steel.
A wood lattice substructure is the common roofing technique used in Europe. This allows for solar panels to be better used as building material. In the United States, this lattice substructure would be the rafters located under a plywood base.
The warranty covers the product’s ability to generate electricity as well as its integrity as a building material. The shingles are guaranteed to last 30 years. Energy output is guaranteed to remain above 90% of its rated efficiency after 10 years, and above 80% after 25 years.
