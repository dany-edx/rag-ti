The team use water to replace organic electrolytes – which enable the flow of electric current between the positive and negative terminals – meaning their batteries aren’t combustible – unlike their lithium-ion counterparts.
Ma said the batteries were well suited for large-scale applications, making them ideal for grid storage and renewable energy integration – especially in terms of safety considerations.
“As our technology advances, other kinds of smaller-scale energy storage applications such as powering people’s homes and entertainment devices could become a reality.”
The process of manufacturing the water batteries indicate mass production is feasible, given materials such as magnesium and zinc are abundant in nature.
“They’re also inexpensive and less toxic than alternatives used in other kinds of batteries, which helps to lower manufacturing costs and reduces risks to human health and the environment,” Ma said.
“Magnesium-ion water batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid battery in the short term – like one to three years – and to replace potentially lithium-ion battery in the long term, 5 to 10 years from now.
“Magnesium is lighter than the alternative metals, including zinc and nickel, has a greater potential energy density and will enable batteries with faster charging times and better capability to support power-hungry devices and applications,” Ma said.
The team’s water battery is closing the gap with lithium-ion technology in terms of energy density, the RMIT scientists claim.
“We recently made a magnesium-ion water battery that has an energy density of 75 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh kg-1) – up to 30% that of the latest Tesla car batteries, so the next step is to increase the energy density of our water batteries by developing new nano materials as the electrode materials.”
After making a series of small-scale trial batteries for numerous peer-reviewed studies to tackle various technological challenges, including boosting energy storage capacity and the lifespan, the team has made the batteries last significantly longer, comparable to the commercial lithium-ion batteries in the market, and ideal for high-speed and intensive use in real-world applications.
“With impressive capacity and extended lifespan, we’ve not only advanced battery technology but also successfully integrated our design with solar panels, showcasing efficient and stable renewable energy storage,” Ma said.
Ma said the water batteries also address end-of-life disposal challenges that consumers, industry and governments globally face with current energy storage technology as they can be disassembled safely, and the materials can be reused or recycled.
As part of an Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage project, Ma’s team is developing water batteries in collaboration with industry partner, GrapheneX, a Sydney tech innovator.
“We also collaborate closely with researchers and experts from renowned universities and research institutions in Australia, US, UK, Japan, Singapore, China and elsewhere. These collaborations facilitate knowledge exchange and access to cutting-edge facilities. By drawing on this global team’s expertise in different areas, we can tackle the complex challenges involved from various angles.”
The team’s latest research Synergy of dendrites-impeded atomic clusters dissociation and side-reactions suppressed inert interface protection for ultrastable Zn anode is published in Advanced Materials.
A comprehensive review of the team’s research history, challenges and potential of water batteries has been published in Energy and Environmental Science: Ammonium-ion energy storage devices for real-life deployment: storage mechanism, electrode design and system integration.

The joint endeavour between the Clean Energy Council, KPMG and the First Nations Clean Energy Network has seen the development of the Leading Practice Principles: First Nations Renewable Energy Projects guide. The guide offers a roadmap for integrating Indigenous wisdom and rights into the renewable energy boom.
This new guide sets out expectations for government, business and industry and details key considerations for engagement at each stage of a project’s life cycle. The guide is formed around incorporating the ten principles outlined by the First Nations Clean Energy Network for clean energy projects.
These ten principles highlight the importance of early and ongoing dialogue, cultural sensitivity, environmental stewardship, and equitable benefit sharing.
The implementation of the guide is a call to action for the industry to go beyond compliance, and to seek out and listen to the voices of First Nations peoples and embed these principles into every phase of project development.
By incorporating these principles into their operations and decision-making processes, proponents of renewable energy projects can demonstrate they are respecting the rights of First Nations peoples and improving outcomes for First Nations rights holders and communities.
The guide outlines First Nations expectations for the renewables sector and details the key considerations for their engagement at each stage of the project lifecycle. In doing so, this Guide aims to unify industry and First Nations communities with early and ongoing engagement throughout the life of a project.
Clean Energy Council Chief Executive Kane Thornton said the intention of the guide is to ensure respect for the rights of Indigenous people and improve outcomes for communities.
“With proper practices in place, the essential work of the energy transition will not only accelerate Australia towards achieving its targets but provide First Nations Australians with an opportunity to be heard and play a crucial role in a defining economic shift for the country.”
Research conducted when developing the guide identified as key current challenges and barriers to effective engagement. They were outlined in the document and set out in the table below.

Despite these challenges, there is also a significant opportunity to build long-term relationships that provide opportunities for First Nations communities.
Active participation in development through energy partnerships and equity will lead to increased employment, maximised community support and new business and economic development from renewables.
KPMG Indigenous Services Lead, Glen Brennan, believes the path to sustainability must be inclusive and acknowledges the deep connections First Nations peoples have with the land, environment, and culture.
“First Nations communities have practised sustainable land cultivation and management for generations, they have cultivated the land in ways that promote biodiversity, soil health, and overall ecosystem resilience” Brennan said.
First Nations Clean Energy Network co-chair, Karrina Nolan said First Nations are central to the Australian Government’s plan for the renewables roll out. “The guide proposes a framework built on respect, engagement, and shared benefits, not just about changing how Australia powers its future but also about healing past wounds and forging new, respectful partnerships,” said Nolan.
The clean energy council states that respectful engagement with Traditional Owners is not just a moral imperative but a strategic one. “When projects are developed in partnership with First Nations communities, they are built on stronger, more resilient foundations.”
Capturing Australia’s potential for solar energy comes with a responsibility to ensure the transition to clean energy is fair and inclusive. The guide ensures new development moves ahead with this cautious optimism.

With the ever-growing fleet of residential and commercial feeding solar into the grid at the same time, and depressing demand, the economics of large scale solar has been negatively impacted.
Speaking to pv magazine Australia, energy economist Bruce Mountain said that the large scale PV market segment was “struggling” because of rooftop PV’s success.
“Rooftop solar has pulled prices down during all of the time that large scale solar has a market to the level that without storage, large scale solar is going to battle for grid supply,” said Mountain, the head of Victoria University’s Energy Policy Centre.
However, there are a number of market developments improving the prospects for big PV, noted Rystad Energy’s David Dixon – chief among them the growth of utility-scale batteries.
“The key point is that we have around 3.5 GW of utility scale batteries under construction, but yet to be energised. That is a lot of flexible load that would put upward pressure on both demand and and energy prices in the middle of the day – because obviously they are only going to charge during the cheap periods, when the solar generates,” said Dixon.

On Monday, Queensland premier Steven Miles took part in a ground-breaking ceremony for the 250 MW / 500 MWh Swanbank Battery, being developed by the state-owned CleanCo.
The project is set to be completed in mid-2025. Tesla is supplying the battery packs for the system. It has received $330 million in funding from Queensland’s Renewable Energy and Hydrogen Jobs Fund.
“Renewables are driving down the spot wholesale price of power below zero, which is why we will continue to invest in them,” said Miles in a statement.
There are a large number of battery projects further along the construction progress around Australia. Rystad’s Dixon reports that as much as 5 GW of utility-scale storage capacity could be energised in the next 12-18 months, up for 1.5 GW online today.
“We are really going to see load coming in during the middle of the day.”
Battery price trends are also heading in the right direction. Dixon said that low lithium and nickel prices have brought down battery prices.
“Projects that might have cost $1000/kWh for utility scale battery projects are now $700/kWh and that probably represents a two-hour battery.” For four-hour batteries, that price could be as low as $600/kWh, Dixon said.
The federal government’s Capacity Investment Scheme will also bolster utility-scale solar prospects. The third round of the underwriting program is likely to support big wind and PV, although details of the auction have yet to be released.
