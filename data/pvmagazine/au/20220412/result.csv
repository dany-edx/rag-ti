https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/12/australias-increasingly-turbulent-irradiance-laid-bare-in-decade-of-mapping/,"LOOKING BACK,RESEARCH,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 12, 2022",Australia’s increasingly turbulent irradiance laid bare in decade of mapping,"On Monday, Slovakian solar forecasting company Solargis published a decade of solar mapping analysis for Australia, North America and India. 
The maps show “significant resource variability,” Solargis said, which has increasing importance as margins for solar projects tighten.
In terms of Australia, where world-class solar irradiance has driven a massive boom in the uptake of PV technologies, Solargis’ analysis finds Australia’s consistency is wavering severely. 
Compared with long-term averages, 2019 saw as much as a 10% increase in irradiance on the east coast. This extreme increase of course contributed to Australia’s worst ever bushfire season, known as Black Summer in 2020.
Likewise, Solgaris said its team is working to understand phenomena like the El Niño and La Niña weather patterns which have massively impacted rainfall and other aspects of Australia’s climate.
“The future of solar integration on the continent [Australia] depends on expert, reliable understanding of how investors and asset managers can prepare for and manage extreme weather events while integrating these future technologies into the grid as the nation transitions from fossil fuels,” the company’s statement read.
These changing solar conditions come on the back of an increasingly challenging financial landscape for solar. “We are seeing margins tighten on global solar projects, due to multiple factors like the phase out of tax credits and subsidies, price volatility and rising supply chain costs,” Solargis CEO Marcel Suri said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/12/green-alumina-processing-pilot-in-wa-receives-major-backing-from-arena/,"FINANCE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 12, 2022",Green alumina processing pilot in WA receives major backing from ARENA,"The federally-run Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has allocated $8.6 million to Alcoa’s Pinjarra alumina refinery to test new carbon reduction technology.
The refinery in Western Australia’s south is seeking to electrify its alumina calcination process using renewable energy. Calcination is the final stage in the alumina refining process and typically uses fossil fuels to heat alumina hydrate crystals. Alumina is then used as a feedstock to create aluminium.
The pilot, which is reported to cost around $20 million, has also been awarded $1.7 million from the Western Australian government, taking Australian government funding to almost half of the cost of the trial.
The grants announced on Monday “complement” funding Alcoa received from ARENA last year to support its trial of mechanical vapour recompression, another technology that would use renewable energy to recycle low-pressure steam in alumina refining to generate process heat.
The company estimates that when combined with a decarbonised grid, the two electrified processes could reduce an alumina refinery’s carbon emissions by as much as 98% and reduce fresh water use by up to 70%.
The electric calcination pilot will happen in two stages, Alcoa’s said. The first stage will run until the end of 2023 and will involve the study, selection, engineering and testing of technologies. 
Subject to a successful completion of the first stage, the second portion of the project will begin in the first quarter of 2024 and continue into mid-2026 with detailed design, construction and pilot testing of this emerging technology at Alcoa’s Pinjarra refinery in Western Australia.

The company is aiming to establish Australia’s first hydrogen vessel manufacturing facility, adding to the two specialist composite manufacturing facilities the company already operates in Kurnell and Ingleburn, both of which straddle Sydney’s south.
The joint venture with Optimum will enable this vision, the company said, by giving it access to Optimum’s technical expertise and intellectual property around composite pressure vessels which store hydrogen and natural gas. 
The partnership will also give the Sydney company greater access to US markets, allowing it to leverage Optimum’s US facilities, customer base and supply chain.
In turn, CST Composites will expand its core capabilities in filament winding technology to support the growth of Optimum’s business in designing and producing composite pressure vessels.
“High-pressure gas storage vessels is one of the biggest and fastest-growing markets globally for advanced composites, particularly for filament-wound carbon fibre composites,” CST Composites’ managing director, Clive Watts, said.
The company says its plan will help advance Australia’s National Hydrogen Strategy, which has highlighted the need to develop the country’s supply chain infrastructure, including hydrogen storage tanks.
More so than other gas and liquid fuels, hydrogen is finicky to store because it is an extremely small molecule which causes various metals to become brittle and ultimately fracture. This means that traditional tanks and pipelines are largely unsuitable to host hydrogen, making storage one of the most frequently pointed to issues for the transport, and therefore adoption, of hydrogen as a ‘future fuel.’
CST Composites says in plans to pursue the considerable sums of government fundings being pumped into the hydrogen industry in the next decade as Australia vies to become a, if not the, global hydrogen superpower. 
“We will be applying for the grants and financial support available to advance our projects, which focus on the innovative design and development of hydrogen and CPV [composite pressure vessel] products,” Watts said.
“We are planning to make a significant investment to grow our new joint venture,” he added.
The company has already received just shy of $833,000 in funding through round two of the federal government’s Manufacturing Modernisation Fund, listed under its parent company’s name WTG Pty Ltd. The government grant listing page says the total investment WTG is making to advance its carbon fibre capabilities is over $3.3 million.
Manufacturing facilities for hydrogen tanks is something major companies have begun moving into. For instance, South Korea’s Hanwha Solutions, of which Q Cells is a subsidiary, acquired the US hydrogen storage tank manufacturer Cimarron Composites in December 2020, and is seeking to invest over US$100 million to expand that arm of the business.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/12/celebrated-inaugural-hydrogen-shipment-now-under-investigation/,"HYDROGEN,QUALITY,QUICK HITS,AUSTRALIA,JAPAN,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 12, 2022",Celebrated inaugural hydrogen shipment now under investigation,"The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is currently investigating Australia’s celebrated first liquified hydrogen shipment which set out from Hastings, Victoria in January destined to return to Japan.
A flame was seen on board, according to safety report, at 9:47pm on January 25, just a few days after the Suiso Frontier, a Japanese-made gas carrier, set sail with the inaugural liquefied hydrogen shipment.
“The unit was immediately shutdown and isolated before the crew implemented the fire prevention response plan,” the Australian Transport Safety Bureau’s notice said.
“No further abnormalities were reported and there were no injuries, damage or pollution.” The Suiso Frontier shipment arrived safely in Japan in February.
A full report will be published upon the completion of the investigation, which is expected sometime in the third quarter of 2022.
The Suiso Frontier ship is capable of carrying 1,250 cubic metres of liquid hydrogen – a strange metric of measurement for the fuel, which is usually talked about in tonnes. The capacity equates to roughly 88 tonne, but it has since been noted the inaugural shipment had nowhere near that much on board. 
It is understood shipment actually held just 2.6 tonnes of liquid hydrogen from the $500 million Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain (HESC) pilot project, while another 1.6 tonne was supplied by Coregas, according to reporting from Renew Economy.

Offgrid Energy Labs has released its new ZincGel battery technology for stationary, low-powered mobility applications. ZincGel batteries can be easily manufactured at scale, even in India, as the raw materials are widely available.
The company designed ZincGel on a modular platform that can be modified. It plans to commercially launch ZincGel products in India by next year. It will target solutions for fleets that operate low-powered electric vehicles like two-wheelers and three-wheelers.
“ZincGel battery technology is a highly efficient alternative to the costly imported batteries currently available in India,” said the company.
Offgrid Energy Labs aims to establish ZincGel as a commercially viable and sustainable technology for battery-swapping applications in the low-powered electric mobility segment. ZincGel batteries can be a viable option to conventional batteries, and they are made from recyclable materials.
“We are here to reduce the dependency on lithium-ion battery packs and move to sustainable battery storage serving both the stationary as well as specific mobility applications,” Rishi Srivastava, co-founder of Offgrid Energy Labs.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/12/radiative-cooling-for-pv-modules-challenges-and-prospects/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 12, 2022",Radiative cooling for PV modules – challenges and prospects,"From pv magazine Global
“The incorporation of radiative cooling into solar panels is still in the research stage and will take some time to reach commercial maturity,” researcher Yuehong Su told pv magazine.
Su and his colleagues have noted the importance of using radiative cooling as a cooling agent for solar panels, but also to extend the operation of PV-thermal modules at night.
“The thermal-to-power efficiency of a solar thermal power plant can be increased by dropping the condensing temperature with an additional radiative cooling strategy,” they explained.
The researchers identified all useful radiative cooling strategies for PV cooling. They stressed the importance of the cooler in reducing a solar cell’s operating temperature without affecting its overall power conversion efficiency. However, several radiative cooling techniques use radiative coolers atop the solar cells, which results in optical losses, they said.
They highlighted the need to evaluate the performance of radiative cooling in solar cells by comparing it with the original encapsulated solar cell. They also noted the importance of setting clear comparison benchmarks.
“Simply comparing the PV efficiency, thermal efficiency, and radiative cooling flux reported in different studies is unfair and insignificant since the material, environmental, and operating conditions are different,” they said. “For instance, radiative cooling is preferable in arid and high-altitude areas, involuntarily resulting in a greater cell-temperature reduction for a PV cell or a higher net radiative cooling flux for a PT-RC collector in these regions.”
They looked at the accessibility, scalability, and reliability of the materials used in radiative cooling systems and found that the polyethylene film used in PV applications may not be resistant enough for long-term outdoor operation.
“Future researches should attach primary importance to alternative cover with better mechanical strength and weatherability,” they said.
They presented their findings in “Applications of radiative sky cooling in solar energy systems: Progress, challenges, and prospects,” which was recently published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Review. The research group includes academics from the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom and the University of Science and Technology of China.
Radiative cooling occurs when the surface of an object absorbs less radiation from the atmosphere and emits more. As a result, the surface loses heat and a cooling effect can be achieved without the need for power. Radiative cooling was recently applied to solar panel cooling by researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China, Purdue University in the United States, the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales in Spain, and the Jordan University of Science and Technology and the Australian College of Kuwait.
