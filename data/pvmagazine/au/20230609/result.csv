It is believed around 130 landowners have been impacted.
The Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the transmission project is still in development, with a spokesperson for EnergyCo telling pv magazine Australia it is on track to be displayed for public exhibition by the end of this year.

The high capacity transmission lines are considered state significant infrastructure, meaning projects follow an alternate approval pathway that makes their realisation more a question of ‘when’ than ‘if.’ 
Given the number of impacted landholders is around 130, how quickly acquisition agreements can be reached is not definite. Pv magazine Australia understands EnergyCo is hoping to finalise the acquisition negotiations within around nine months. This, however, is dependent on whether any landowners decide to take the matter to court, which could add around 12 to 18 months of delay.
“EnergyCo’s priority is to complete any acquisitions by negotiated agreement,” the EnergyCo spokesperson said. “Landowners have been provided with an acquisition support team to help them understand their rights and obligations together with any other aspect of the acquisition process.”

Under the Land Acquisition (Just Terms Compensation) Act in New South Wales, affected landholders must be paid at least the current market value for their land, as well as losses for disturbances. On top of this, the state government in 2022 introduced a scheme to pay landowners $10,000 (USD 6,700) per year, for 20 years, for every kilometre of new high-voltage transmission infrastructure passing through their property.
As mentioned, the issuance of EnergyCo’s acquisition letters marks beginning of the formal negotiation process with landowners.
EnergyCo says the Central-West Orana transmission link’s public EIS exhibition later this year will include a formal submissions process managed by the Department of Planning and Environment. “EnergyCo will notify the community once the EIS is placed on public exhibition,” it added.
EnergyCo released its first set of detailed plans and costing around the state’s Renewable Energy Zones in May in the form of its NSW Network Infrastructure Strategy. Renewable Energy Zones are effectively hubs of new clean energy generation which will underpin the state’s transitions away from coal.

According the EnergyCo, four of the state’s five REZs (Illawarra’s REZ is yet to be costed), carry a preliminary estimates price tag of $7.8 billion. These zones will add an extra 14 GW of renewable generation to the state by 2030.
Specifically, the Central-West Orana REZ will add 4.5 GW. This is up from the 3 GW flagged in earlier planning documents.
With the mammoth transformation set to occur in the state’s REZs, local communities and councils are increasingly banding together to ensure enduring benefits are provided to impacted areas.

Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) and Total Eren, both of which are pursuing green hydrogen projects in the Territory, are among the companies to have secured land in the precinct that has already received $1.5 billion (USD 1.01 billion) in federal funding.
FFI has yet to reveal the details of its proposed project but Total Eren signed a non-binding agreement with the NT government last year to build a green hydrogen project near Darwin that would include more than 2 GW of solar providing energy for a 1 GW electrolyser to produce more than 80,000 tonnes of renewable hydrogen per annum.
Minerals company Tivan, which plans to build a facility at the Middle Arm precinct to process vanadium for products such as batteries, and fellow Perth-based battery minerals producer Avenira, which is focused on developing a plant to process minerals for lithium phosphate batteries, are also on the list of likely anchor tenants.
The fifth proponent to secure land in the ‘sustainable’ precinct is Tamboran Resources, which has announced plans to develop a gas processing facility supported by gas sourced via fracking operations at the Beetaloo Basin.
Tamboran’s inclusion in the precinct has prompted critics to question the environmental merits of the Middle Arm precinct but NT Chief Minister Natasha Fyles has consistently described the project as a sustainable development precinct.
“We’ve always said that sustainability will be at the core of Middle Arm, and our focus on clean energy demonstrates that,” she said. “A lot of nonsense gets spouted about Middle Arm, but today’s announcement shows the Territory, investors and the rest of the country just how committed my government is to making this a reality.”
Fyles said the Middle Arm precinct will play a key role in the Territory’s future, delivering “new sources of renewable and low-emissions energy, new investment, new industries, and most importantly, new jobs for Territorians.”
“We’re absolutely committed to growing our economy while also transitioning to net zero emissions, and Middle Arm will play a huge part in that transition,” she said. “This is what responsibly decarbonising and diversifying our economy looks like.”

The NT government has forecast that collectively, the projects awarded exclusivity over land in the precinct represent tens of billions of dollars in capital investment, with the entire Middle Arm development to create about 20,000 jobs in the Territory.
The government said the land commitments mean the proponents’ preferred sites in Middle Arm will be set aside for up to 12 months to provide each developer with the “confidence and certainty” to continue developing their proposals.
The companies are now expected to progress their facility designs, engineering work and pre-feasibility studies and environmental approvals.
The allocation of land comes after the federal government this week awarded $1 million for a feasibility study into the growth potential of a clean hydrogen market in Darwin.
The Darwin Clean Hydrogen Hub joint feasibility study will look at opportunities to supply clean hydrogen solutions to domestic and international customers.
Middle Arm is already home to a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export hub, and the Territory government is pushing ahead with construction of a 35 MW/35 MWh battery at the site. The Darwin-Katherine Battery Energy Storage System is expected to be operational later this year.

Planned for a site about 70 kilometres west of Mackay in the Pioneer Valley, the project is being touted as possibly the largest PHES project in the world. Proposed to be delivered in two stages by 2035, when complete the mega project is expected to be capable of providing 5 GW of generation capacity for 24 hours, equivalent to about half of the entire state’s peak usage.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the project, forecast to unlock high-quality wind and solar generation sources in the nearby Central and Northern Queensland Renewable Energy Zones, will provide the long-term storage and reliability needed to power Queensland’s clean energy future.
“The project is the cornerstone of the Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan,” he said. “This mega pumped hydro project will act like a giant battery, and when connected to our Queensland SuperGrid, will underpin the reliability of our publicly owned grid by storing the energy generated by our renewable energy zones.”

With initial studies indicating there is the potential for stage one of the project to be completed by 2032, Twin Hills Engineering and Drilling has this week been awarded the geotechnical contract, which will form a key part of the exploratory stage for the project.
The six-month shallow drilling program will be used to inform project design, a fundamental part of the project’s Detailed Analytical Report. The report is due to be presented to the Queensland government in 2024.
The awarding of the geotechnical contract comes after the Water2Wire joint venture partnership was appointed to deliver the front-end engineering and design (FEED) for the Pioneer-Burdekin project.
Queensland Hydro, the new publicly owned entity established to oversee the delivery of the state government’s planned pumped hydro projects, said the Water2Wire joint venture will bring significant engineering, hydropower expertise and capability to determine the technical specifications, schedule and cost parameters for the project.
The Water2Wire team has delivered FEED design multiple projects including for Queensland Hydro’s proposed 2 GW Borumba pumped hydro project, Genex’s 250 MW Kidston PHES in north Queensland, the 1 GW Lake Onslow PHES in New Zealand, and the 3 GW Bath County PHES in the United Kingdom.

Queensland Hydro Chief Executive Officer Kieran Cusack said the appointments were an asset to the project.
“Both Twin Hills and Water2Wire had outstanding tender responses that showcased both their impressive capability and strong local links,” he said.
“With Water2Wire’s recent work on high-profile projects like Borumba and Kidston and their collective expertise in delivering pumped hydro projects around the world they will be a great asset to this project.
“We’re also delighted to be working with a local family business employing local workers.”
It is anticipate the project will support more than 3,000 jobs during construction and de Brenni said it will also offer “hundreds of supply chain opportunities.”
“It’s regions like Mackay that are at the centre of this Queensland’s renewable energy transformation – which will unleash new industrial jobs in hydrogen, renewables, manufacturing, and critical minerals,” he said.

The Perth-headquartered company said it will establish at least two identical but independent test sites for its Nanoshield Solar product on a section of the existing solar system at the Daylily Nursery Farm near McMinnville in southern Tennessee.
Nanvue said the Nanoshield Solar product is an antimicrobial coating that is self-maintaining, anti-fouling, anti-static and hydrophilic. The company said when the transparent coating applied to the surface of solar panels, a chemical reaction is created on the glass which grows a “cross-linked” and “branched” ultra-thin silicone film from below the surface out.
Nanoveu Managing Director Alfred Chong said the coating’s anti-static properties inhibit the growth of algae and lichen on solar panels while the film’s hydrophilic properties reduce the capacity for dirt and other surface contaminants to cling to panels.
“Our products are a cost-effective solution to maintain a clear, algae and pollen free solar panel surface for many years, therefore improving energy production and reducing maintenance costs,” he said.
“We believe that Nanoshield Solar has significant application potential for large solar assets globally, and we look forward to updating the market on the commercialisation of this unique technology.”
Chong said Nanoveu is initially targeting large-scale solar assets and distributors in Southeast Asia and various regions in the U.S. where solar panels are more susceptible to algae growth and pollen dust.
Nanoveu said data from the Tennessee trial will be collected over a four-to-six-week period to demonstrate the benefits of Nanoshield Solar treatment while the site will also be used to showcase the product to potential U.S.-based customers.
Nanoveu’s entry into the North America market follows the recent signing of a marketing and distribution agreement for its Nanoshield products in the Philippines with solar products wholesaler and developer One Renewable Energy Enterprise.
The three-year deal with One Renewable, which has an operational portfolio of 21.5 MW including rooftop and microgrid installations and a project pipeline of 1.1 GW, is targeting sales of more than $1 million (USD 750,000) in the first year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/09/new-report-calls-macquarie-groups-climate-commitment-into-question/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",PV MAGAZINE,"JUNE 9, 2023",New report calls Macquarie Group’s climate commitment into question,"A new report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) has found that the Macquarie Group has continued to invest heavily in fossil fuel projects after signing up to the international Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) in October 2021.
The Sydney-based Macquarie Group is the world’s largest infrastructure asset manager with more than $871 billion (USD 580 billion) in assets under management, according to its latest annual report.
In 2019, Macquarie joined the RE100 intitiative, committing to power 100% of its operations with renewable energy by 2025.
The IEEFA report however indicates that since making the NZBA commitment, the investment giant has issued loans and acquired stakes in oil and gas companies with “aggressive expansion plans.”
This included a $15 million loan to Empire Energy to support the development of the controversial Beetaloo Basin gas project, and a 5% stake in Beach Energy. The ASX-listed Beach Energy is targeting new developments in five different basins in Australia and New Zealand in the next two years.
Macquarie also made a contribution of an undisclosed amount to a $3 billion loan to Texas gas company Southwestern Energy, which has expansion plans that would create more CO2 than Australia’s total emissions in 2021.
Overall, Macquarie has shares and bonds in 11 of the world’s largest oil and gas majors, worth about $3.5 billion, all of which are planning major short-term expansion in the next seven years.

In addition, the company has a further $1.4 billion in nine smaller oil and gas companies.

IEEFA Australia Chief Executive Officer Amandine Denis-Ryan, a co-author of the report, said the findings were out of step with Macquarie Group’s pledge to net zero.
“Our analysis finds that Macquarie Group’s actions directly contradict its climate commitments,” she said.
“The investments identified in this report add up to about $5 billion. A more comprehensive analysis of Macquarie Group’s exposure to upstream oil and gas companies through shares and bonds (excluding loans) found about $7.7 billion of exposure.”
The reported figure of $7.7 billion is in stark contrast to Macquarie’s disclosed $1.2 billion of financing exposure to the full oil and gas chain, which the company published in its 2022 Net Zero and Climate Risk Report.
Transparency needed
Denis-Ryan called on Macquarie to provide more transparency in its disclosures.
“The discrepancy between reported and actual exposure may be explained by the disclosures focusing only on on-balance sheet activities,” she said. “If so, Macquarie Group’s disclosure on financed emissions appears to be exploiting a loophole in the NZBA guidelines, which do not mandate member banks to establish targets for their fossil fuel exposure through off-balance sheet activities.”
Macquarie’s off-balance sheet activities include equity and bonds investments in the oil and gas sector, while the scope of the current NZBA guidelines covers lending and equity investments.
For its part, the NZBA has committed to updating its guidelines to include off-balance sheet activities once a common carbon accounting standard is built and tested.
The $7.7 billion figure also dwarfs the disclosed financing exposure to upstream oil and gas of three of Australia’s big four banks. CBA disclosed $2.1 billion, while NAB and Westpac each disclosed $1.9 billion, the report said.
The IEEFA report also questioned the future financial performance of the gas sector and identified a “looming supply glut” in coming years that could affect prices and profits.

Alongside its oil and gas investment, Macquarie is investing in renewables, including solar. Macquarie Asset Management subsidiary the Green Energy Group has raised more than $2.5 billion for the development of large-scale solar and wind projects – including  8 GW of projects in Europe.
In March, the Green Energy Group announced that it was partnering with Shell to deliver the 200 MW/400 MWh Rangebank BESS, in Cranbourne, Victoria.

Chinese and Australian companies have expressed interest in strengthening hydrogen cooperation, reports Global Times. The Chinese state media outlet noted that Li Chunlin, the deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission, recently met with Andrew Forrest, the founder and executive chairman of Fortescue Metals Group.
Japan has unveiled a green transformation plan, committing JPY 20 trillion ($225 billion) to drive the mobilisation of JPY 150 trillion over the next decade. The initiative targets hydrogen, ammonia, synthetic methane, and synthetic fuels, with a focus on expanding into high-demand overseas markets. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the “Asia Zero Emission Community” initiative will promote the energy transition in Asia, leveraging Japan’s expertise in decarbonisation technologies such as hydrogen and ammonia. The government is also revising its Basic Hydrogen Strategy, aiming to increase hydrogen supply to approximately 12 million tons by 2040 – a sixfold increase.
Kansai Electric Power Co. (Kepco) and Canadian energy infrastructure developer ATCO have launched a full-scale feasibility study to create an integrated clean fuel supply chain from Canada. “This study will examine a series of business segments coming together to form the supply chain, including production of clean fuels (blue hydrogen or blue ammonia) from natural gas in inland Canada, transportation to the west coast, and shipping to Japan,” said Kepco.
Malaysia is actively positioning itself as a regional leader in renewable energy by investing in electric assets, such as charging infrastructure and cleaner energy carriers. The country is set to unveil its Energy Transition Roadmap in phases, with the initial focus on supporting the solar and hydrogen industries through the establishment of renewable energy special zones. Economy Minister Mohd Rafizi Ramli recently outlined the importance of the energy transition plans to the Qatari government and companies, identifying them as Malaysia’s second priority after fiscal and financial stability.
The hydrogen refuelling station market is on track to record a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 17.9% between 2023 and 2032, Global Market Insights said in a newly published report. The market was valued at USD 4.77 billion in 2022 and is expected to surpass USD 25.7 billion by 2032, with the mobile hydrogen refuelling station segment reaching a value of more than USD 7.7 billion in 2032.

A team of researchers from Northumbria University in the United Kingdom has created Solar2Water, a solar-powered system that extracts moisture from the air to produce drinking water.
The patented solution overcomes limitations of conventional atmospheric water generators by generating a constant amount of water, regardless of air humidity, and producing twice as much water with the same energy input.
Solar2Water operates solely on solar energy, with two solar panels and a battery for continuous operation. Its creators emphasise its user-friendly design and robust construction, enabling use in any environment without specialised training.
Muhammad Wakil Shahzad, a professor at Northumbria University, received seed funding from the University to develop Solar2Water. After securing proof-of-concept funding from the Northern Accelerator, Shahzad and his team successfully developed a pilot system capable of producing 15 to 20 litres of drinking water per day.
The goal is to expand the water production capacity to 50 litres per day, aiming to provide enough drinking water for a small community.
