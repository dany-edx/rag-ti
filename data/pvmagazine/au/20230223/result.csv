Victorian developer Akaysha Energy, owned by US-based asset manager BlackRock, has already commenced early works after winning the contract to build the battery at the state-owned site of the former 1,400 MW coal-fired Munmorah Power Station, near Doyalson, on the NSW Central Coast.
Akaysha has been contracted to deliver a battery with a guaranteed continuous power capacity of at least 700 MW and a guaranteed useable energy storage capacity of at least 1,400 MWh for the purposes of providing a System Integrity Protection Scheme (SIPS) service.
However, Akaysha has opted to build an even larger battery. The battery energy storage system (BESS) is now expected to have a total capacity of 850 MW/1.68 GWh which allows for degradation of the battery over time to ensure ongoing security of supply. It also allows Akaysha to utilise the excess capacity to tap into additional revenue streams.
The Waratah Super Battery forms part of the state government’s response to the 2022 announcement by Origin Energy that it will bring forward the closure of the 2,880 MW Eraring Power Station to August 2025, seven years earlier than previously scheduled.
The battery is designed to serve as a “shock absorber” for the electricity grid, providing reserve transmission capacity and stability, rather than additional electricity storage capacity. It is intended to allow consumers in the state’s main load centres access to more energy from existing electricity generators while maintaining network security.

NSW transmission network owner Transgrid said the BESS, which will connect to the grid via a new 330 kV overhead transmission line to the existing Munmorah substation, is expected to be operational by mid-2025 – in advance of Eraring’s expected date of closure.
Transgrid Executive General Manager of Network Marie Jordan said the network operator will coordinate the delivery of the various project components, including the design and installation of the SIPS service to trigger the battery into operation when additional energy is required.
“As part of the project we are carrying out major upgrades to existing transmission lines and substations to enable additional energy to be delivered to consumers,” she said. “We will also develop and operate a $30 million (USD 20.4 million) System Integrity Protection Scheme to control the standby network battery’s activation when additional energy is required, ensuring it can respond almost instantly to any disruptions in the power system.
The Waratah Super Battery is being delivered as a Priority Transmission Infrastructure Project under the Electricity Infrastructure Investment Act 2020.
“We are getting on with the job of delivering this critical infrastructure to ensure a secure, reliable and affordable energy supply to homes and businesses in Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong while new renewable energy zones and transmission connections are completed,” Jordan said.

The program aims to make the country’s military barracks and bases more self-reliant.
Assistant Defence Minister Matt Thistlethwaite made the announcement earlier this week during a visit to Robertson Barracks near Darwin in the Northern Territory, where an 11 MW solar farm comprising more than 27,000 solar panels and a 2.5 MW battery system is already under construction and is expected be operational by the end of 2023.
“The beauty of this project is that it takes barracks off the grid,” he said, adding the commitment will support Defence capability.
“We’re investing in renewable energy projects because they will reduce energy costs for the defence force,” he said. “It means that you’ve got more funds to invest in capability improvements in the future.”
Thistlethwaite said the program will see a combined 60 MW of solar energy, enough to power the equivalent of about 15,000 households each year, installed at the sites to diversify supply and increase energy independence and reduce the reliance on diesel fuel.
A total of 25 MWh of storage capacity will also be delivered as part of the program “to increase energy resilience and power quality.”

Among the projects is a “large-scale” renewable energy facility of an undisclosed capacity to be developed at the Edinburgh Defence Precinct in South Australia. Other projects include the installation of solar and storage systems at defence facilities in the NT, South Australia,  and Western Australia. Design work will also commence for a solar system to be installed at the Russell Headquarters complex in the Australian Capital Territory.
Construction has already commenced on the first of the projects and the works schedule is to continue until 2027-28.
The Department of Defence said the projects will “increase resilience at Defence bases and reduce dependency on fuel supply chains for backup power generation.”
The investment builds upon earlier renewable energy initiatives at Australian defence sites, including at the naval base at Garden Island in Western Australia and the Victoria Barracks. Government data shows that the program has already delivered savings of approximately $380,000 per year and in 2020-2021, Defence generated approximately 2.18 GWh hours of clean energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/23/australias-energy-market-operator-is-worried-about-the-grids-reliability-but-should-it-be/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"FEBRUARY 23, 2023",Australia’s energy market operator is worried about the grid’s reliability. But should it be?,"The market operator has certainly put up in lights its message that there’s an “urgent need for investment in generation, long-duration storage and transmission to achieve reliability requirements over the next decade”. Yet the reliability outlook has actually improved overall since the Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) previous statement last August.
At first pass, this seems counterintuitive. How can reliability be improving, yet still evidently cause for grave concern?
To interpret the report and statements fully, it’s important to understand how the analysis is prepared, and what is and isn’t included in the overall outlook.
Every year, AEMO prepares a report that assesses the reliability of the National Electricity Market (NEM). Reliability is a measure of the power system’s ability to supply demand. A reliable power system has adequate resources – generation, demand response and transmission capacity – to supply customers.
In the NEM, the reliability of the system is reported in terms of “expected unserved energy”. This is essentially a measure of the expected amount of electricity not delivered to customers, as a result of inadequate capacity to meet the anticipated demand.
AEMO’s reliability assessment looks ahead ten years, to provide information to the electricity market more broadly on any potential gaps or shortfalls in supply that would put reliability at risk. This was intended to guide the private sector, by highlighting “opportunities” for new investment across the electricity system. Hence the report is named the Electricity Statement of Opportunities.
But, importantly, the assessment does not actually forecast a market response or any other intervention in power generation or transmission. It generally only looks at “committed projects” – those that are all but guaranteed to be completed.
As such, it provides an estimate of the expected unserved energy over the next decade, if (and only if) there is no further investment or response. A consequence of this is that a large amount of potential investment and future capacity is not included.
AEMO’s updated report was prompted by a range of “material generation capacity changes” since the August statement. This includes delays to the Kurri Kurri gas-fired power plant and the Snowy 2.0 hydro project.
However, it includes the addition of 461 megawatts of battery storage and 1,326MW of wind developments that have reached “committed” status since August. It also includes the Waratah Super Battery, which will effectively unlock additional capacity in the transmission system.
This is why the reliability outlook has improved. There are now no “supply gaps” projected in any region of the NEM, which covers Australia’s southern and eastern states, until 2025-26, where previously there were.

Besides these committed projects, more than 2,000 MW of battery capacity is “anticipated” to be available. But, as it has not yet met the formal commitment criteria, it has not been considered in AEMO’s assessment.
The latest report also doesn’t include capacity that will supported by the Victorian Renewable Energy Target or the NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap.
Several transmission developments that are expected to significantly reduce projected reliability risks were also not included. One of these, the Victoria-New South Wales Interconnector West, received a significant boost just yesterday, with the Victorian government issuing orders to accelerate the project. Other schemes are still working their way through the regulatory process, and hence are also not yet included in AEMO’s statements.
So, while AEMO’s assessment projects supply gaps appearing from 2026 onwards, as various projects and other initiatives progress we can expect this outlook to continue to improve. This is, after all, how it’s supposed to work. The market operator highlights emerging gaps, and various actors respond to prevent those gaps becoming reality.
This is certainly not to say everything is fine. There are some significant risks and challenges on the horizon.
The potential closure of Eraring power station in just two-and-a-half years is a key risk to reliability in NSW in particular. In the shorter term, a return to hot summers in 2023-24 could give the system its harshest test in years.
The delay of Snowy 2.0 may also have significant impacts on the reliability of the system. Unfortunately, AEMO’s update doesn’t provide much meaningful information on the implications of this situation.
AEMO’s report does not include the transmission projects required to realise the benefits of Snowy 2.0, so the impact of a delay is rather a moot point. It is reasonable to assume, however, that the promised 2 gigawatts of firm supply would have a considerable impact on the reliability outlook.
As previously mentioned, there are plenty of projects – renewable, storage, transmission and demand response – that can mitigate these risks. But of course we have to actually deliver them. Supply-chain issues, skills shortages and community opposition are key challenges facing the delivery of new capacity.
At a federal level, the newly announced Capacity Investment Scheme may help bring more storage capacity online. The Rewiring the Nation plan is intended to bring forward important transmission projects. A bevy of state government programs and interventions will also help bring new projects online.
Supply shortages can be assured if nothing happens beyond what is assumed in the assessment. Things are of course happening – but we do have to get cracking.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/23/nanovue-offers-self-cleaning-solution-for-solar-panel-soiling/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 23, 2023",Nanovue offers self-cleaning solution for solar panel soiling,"Nanoveu has created a hydrophilic self-cleaning nanocoating for solar panels that the Perth-headquartered company claims can mitigate potential-induced degradation while delivering reduced cleaning costs in PV power systems in both dry and humid environments.
The ASX-listed Nanovue said it has successfully expanded its Nanoshield product suite to include the E-series hard coat, an antimicrobial coating that is self-maintaining, anti-fouling, anti-static and hydrophilic.
The transparent coating, which was developed from the company’s antiviral products and features metal oxide nano-sized particles, has been designed initially to inhibit the growth of algae and lichen on solar panels.
Nanoveu said algae growth is a major issue for solar systems deployed in tropical conditions and if left unchecked, can cause up to 26% energy loss in the module’s generation capacity.
As well as preventing algae growth, the company said the E-series coating’s hydrophilic and anti-static properties inhibit sand, dirt and all other surface contaminants clinging to panels.
Nanoveu Managing Director Alfred Chong said the coating’s self-cleaning properties mean contaminants wash away with rainwater.
“As opposed to water-repellent coatings, the hydrophilic effect reduces the angle of water droplets, allowing penetration beneath the contaminant,” the company said in a statement. “Antistatic, larger particle sized debris such as dirt and sand simply slide off the surface.”
Chong said the unique properties of the coating makes it suitable as a self-cleaning solution for solar systems in both humid and dry climates.
“With this new and unique development, we will work towards establishing Nanoveu as an attractive solution to enhance the performance of solar assets worldwide,” he said.
Soiling of solar panels remains a major issue for the industry with the International Energy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA-PVPS) estimating that lost revenue from PV module soiling amounts to more than $4.67 billion (USD 3.2 billion) per year.
The IEA-PVPS estimates that in 2018 soiling caused at least a 3% to 4% loss to global annual energy production from PV. This is expected to increase to around 4% to 5%, and $6 billion to $10 billion this year.
Nanoveu is currently testing the efficiency of the Nanoshield product in the Philippines with 55 MW of solar projects identified as suitable sites for the technology. The results of the trials are expected to be published in the first half of 2022.
In addition to the solar panel market, Nanoveu expects Nanoshield’s antifouling capability could be applied to other applications including ships and boat hulls that constantly require antifouling treatment.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/23/energyaustralia-receives-planning-approval-for-1-4-gwh-big-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 23, 2023",EnergyAustralia receives planning approval for 1.4 GWh big battery,"Hong Kong-owned electricity gen-tailer EnergyAustralia confirmed it has received planning approval from the Victorian government for construction of a 350 MW/1.4 GWh battery energy storage system at Hazelwood North in the Latrobe Valley.
The Wooreen Energy Storage System will be located alongside EnergyAustralia’s 450 MW Jeeralang gas-fired power station, allowing the battery to utilise existing electricity and transmission infrastructure.
EnergyAustralia’s Head of Portfolio Development Dan Nugent said the planning approval brings building the Wooreen project a step closer with the lithium-ion battery scheduled to be commissioned by the end of 2026, ahead of Yallourn’s closure in mid-2028.
“With the approval of the planning application, our focus now is on finalising procurement and the grid connection application ahead of starting construction of the battery next year,” he said.
EnergyAustralia, which is owned by Hong Kong-based power company CLP Group, said the Wooreen project, and others like it, will be critical as the clean energy transition takes place, seeing baseload coal-fired power stations retire and replaced with variable renewable energy, as well as flexible generation and storage technologies.
The company said the battery will provide cover for more than 230,000 households for four hours before needing to be recharged, “helping to secure Victoria’s energy supply, enable more renewable energy to enter the electricity network.”
“Its ability to store and rapidly supply energy during times of high demand will be vital in supporting solar and wind renewables as part of Victoria’s electricity system of the future,” Nugent said.

The Wooreen battery is part of EnergyAustralia’s growing battery trading portfolio which forms part of the company’s strategy to be carbon neutral by 2050.The gen-tailer already operates two utility-scale battery storage systems in Victoria: a 25 MW/50 MWh battery co-located with the Gannawarra Solar Farm, and the 30 MW/30 MWh Ballarat big battery located at the regional city’s terminal station.
EnergyAustralia has also partnered with renewables developer Edify Energy on two battery storage projects being developed in southwest New South Wales (NSW). Due for completion during the summer of 2023/24, the Darlington Point and Riverina battery energy storage projects are part of an energy storage system with a combined 150 MW/300 MWh of storage capacity spread over three individual but co-located assets.
EnergyAustralia is also investigating the feasibility of developing a 500 MW/2 GWh big battery adjacent to its 1.4 GW Mount Piper coal-fired power station in NSW.
It has also signed an agreement with Genex Power to provide equity financing for the construction of the 250 MW Kidston pumped hydro project being built as part of the Kidston renewables hub in north Queensland.
