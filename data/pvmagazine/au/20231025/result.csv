Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the Energy (Renewable Transformation and Jobs) Bill 2023, introduced to state parliament on Tuesday, will legislate the government’s commitments to 50% of the state’s energy being renewable by 2030, 70% by 2032 and 80% by 2035.
The government also intends to secure 54% majority public ownership for generation assets, and full ownership of transmission and “deep storage” assets.
The bill will also establish the Job Security Guarantee Fund to provide workers at existing publicly owned power stations access to new jobs, training or financial assistance.
“These laws are about our real commitment to a publicly owned energy system, one that protects tens of thousands of jobs in existing industries already vulnerable to carbon emissions,” de Brenni said.
“Nowhere else in the world has a government offered a job security guarantee in law, to ensure Queenslanders working in publicly owned coal-fired power stations are given peace of mind, and financial security as we deliver our transition to clean energy.”
De Brenni said the bill is the next foundational step in implementing the Energy and Jobs Plan that calls for an additional 22 GW of new wind and solar projects by 2035, supported by grid-scale batteries and pumped hydro storage.
The state government has committed $19 billion in capital investment over the next four years to support new wind, solar, storage and transmission.
“We’ve already made significant progress under the plan, with new generation and storage … but we must enshrine the QEJP into law to lock in an orderly transition,” de Brenni said.
The tabling of the bill was welcomed by the Queensland Conservation Council (QCC), with Director Dave Copeman calling on the state opposition to endorse the laws.
“Every new solar and wind project that connects to the grid is bringing down power bills, reducing the state’s emissions and creating regional jobs. That’s a win-win-win for our hip-pocket, environment and economy,” he said.
“We need the state opposition to back this legislation to demonstrate they are committed to ending the climate and energy wars, and getting on with the transition to clean, renewable energy.”

Victorian Industry Minister Natalie Hutchins said the Made in Victoria – Energy Technologies Manufacturing program will support eligible manufacturers to purchase or develop new equipment, skills, or technology enabling them to capitalise on renewable energy opportunities.
“Through this grant program, we’re supporting our transition to net zero and the transformation of our manufacturing sector to develop more skills and capabilities, attract investment and create the jobs of tomorrow,” she said.
The state government said eligible projects could include but are not limited to the manufacture of advanced materials and components for renewable energy generation, transmission, storage and transportation.
Eligibility criteria include a minimum cash co-contribution from applicants of $3 for every $1 granted, an existing manufacturing presence in Victoria, and project activities will need to be completed within 12 months of the date of the grant agreement. It’s anticipated that successful projects will be able to commence in the first quarter of 2024.
Hutchins said the grants program will generate economic activity, secure well-paid jobs, increase exports, and reduce Victoria’s reliance on volatile international supply chains.
“We’re backing local businesses to be global leaders in the production of renewable energy components,” she said.
Applications for the Made in Victoria – Energy Technologies Manufacturing grants close 13 December 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/25/albanese-announces-2-billion-boost-to-critical-mineral-financing/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 25, 2023",Albanese announces $2 billion boost to critical mineral financing,"The federal government has announced a $2 billion expansion in financing available under its Critical Minerals Facility to back Australian critical minerals mining and processing projects.
Speaking in the United States, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the finance boost will help facilitate the transition to a decarbonised economy while cementing Australia’s position as a world-leading provider of critical minerals used in clean energy technologies like electric vehicles, storage batteries, wind turbines and solar panels.
According to the Albanese, Australia’s critical minerals are the building blocks for a clean energy future, and harnessing their capacity is essential to the government’s commitment to transforming Australia into a renewable energy superpower.
“We want to move Australia up the international value chain in critical minerals, energy and manufacturing,” Albanese said at a press conference in Washington, adding that the funding increase will help to develop supply chains with the United States and support shared clean energy and manufacturing ambitions.
“Australia is committed to building sustainable and secure critical minerals supply chains with the United States,” he said. “This is central to building a clean energy future and delivering economic growth.”
Independent modelling shows increasing exports of critical minerals and energy-transition minerals could create more than 115,000 new jobs and add $71.2 billion to Australia’s GDP by 2040.
“Australians will benefit through this investment in critical minerals, through technology, skills, jobs and economic gains,” Albanese said.
The extra financing will double the capacity of the Critical Minerals Facility, managed by the government’s Export Finance Australia (EFA) agency. Under the facility, companies can apply for loans, financial guarantees or performance and warranty bonds to help establish projects and develop export markets.
The facility is also aimed at reducing China’s dominance of global supply chains for processed materials. While Australia has some of the world’s richest deposits of critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, vanadium and significant deposits of rare earth elements, China currently dominates the critical minerals processing sector.
About 75% of the world’s lithium and 85% of cobalt is processed in China. It also refines more than 90% of the world’s graphite, a mineral crucial to the manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles.
Only last week China announced plans to restrict exports of graphite, saying permits will be needed from December for synthetic graphite material — including high-purity, high-strength and high-density versions — as well as for natural flake graphite.
The announcement came just days after the United States extended its restrictions on the kinds of semiconductors that American companies can sell to Chinese firms.
Australian Resources Minister Madeleine King said creating a sustainable and reliable supply of critical minerals is vital to supporting the Australian and United States’ manufacturing sectors.
“The road to net zero runs through Australia’s resources sector,” she said. “We are well positioned to be a world-leading provider of critical minerals, including rare earths elements, and to support global efforts on clean energy transformation.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/25/clearvue-teams-with-alpha-investment-to-commercialise-solar-glass-tech/,"FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 25, 2023",ClearVue teams with Alpha Investment to commercialise solar glass tech,"Western Australia-based ClearVue Technologies has secured a $30 million at-the-market facility (ATM) with Sydney-headquartered Alpha Investment Partners that will support the scaled development of its integrated glazing unit (IGU) products and integrated Solar Façade solutions.
ClearVue has developed specialised glass technologies that preserve glass transparency while generating electricity. The IGUs feature PV cells around the edges of each unit. The units incorporate a nanoparticle interlayer and spectral-selective coating on the rear external surface which allow much of the light to pass through but redirects infrared and ultraviolet (UV) light to the edge of the IGU where it is harvested by solar cells. The company calculates that 10 square metres of its glass generates approximately 1.35 kWh of clean energy per day.
ClearVue Chief Executive Officer Martin Deil said the ATM facility provides the Perth-based company with access to standby equity capital over the next five years, which is a vital growth step as it begins scaling up activities in multiple global markets.
“Over recent months, the commercial potential of our technology has been validated by independent, third-party verification demonstrating the real-world performance benefits of our unique products,” he said.
“Having access to flexible capital is critical to accelerate our growth plans and progress our pathway to commercialisation.”
Earlier this month, testing by the Singapore Building and Construction Authority confirmed that ClearVue’s second-generation PV IGUs reduce both total building energy consumption and costs.
In September, the company said it had confirmed the scalability and “commercial viability” of its second-generation IGUs after a mass production run using a standard manufacturing line at a factory in China.
Dell said having access to the funding facility will allow ClearVue “to respond quickly, efficiently and cost-effectively to emerging investor demand as it begins scaling up activities in multiple global markets.”
The ATM agreement comes after ClearVue earlier this year secured a $2 million grant through the Western Australian government’s Investment Attraction Fund to establish new manufacturing operations in Perth.
ClearVue said it will use the funds to ‘on-shore’ the manufacturing of key components required for its IGUs and windows.
Specifically, the company plans to establish a solar PV strip assembly line to manufacture the strips used for solar collection in its solar windows and facades. Additionally, ClearVue intends to create an in-house nanoparticle and quantum dot production capability to produce nanoparticles for use in the lamination interlayer currently used in the majority of the company’s end products.
