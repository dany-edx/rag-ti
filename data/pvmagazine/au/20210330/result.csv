“Much of this increase was due to the small-scale solar sector, which added more than 3 GW of new capacity in 2020 to record its fourth-straight record-breaking year. This brought the sector’s share of Australia’s renewable energy generation to 23.5%, pushing it past hydro into second place for the first time,” the report said.
“Rooftop solar has again been one of the great success stories for the industry, despite COVID-19 shutdowns, with a record 378,451 systems installed across Australia,” Clean Energy Council Chief Executive, Kane Thornton, said.

“Australia’s clean energy transition accelerated again in 2020 as wind and rooftop solar set new records, battery storage came of age, and the hydrogen sector continued its rapid development. This all points to Australia realising its potential as a clean energy superpower,” Thornton said.
“Our industry is now generating enough clean energy to power every home in Australia 1.5 times over.”
The report notes 2020 was a massive year for Australian states and territories, a number of which hit historic milestones and made groundbreaking plans.
Australia’s island state, Tasmania, became its first to source 100% of its electricity from renewable sources last year. “The Tasmanian Government has now set a 200% renewable energy target by 2040, which is the world’s most ambitious target for renewables,” the report said.
The more populous renewables powerhouse, South Australia, passed its own significant milestone in October of 2020, when solar delivered 100% of its electricity demand for one hour. It was “the first time this had been achieved by a jurisdiction as large as South Australia anywhere in the world.”
New South Wales was also applauded by the peak body for its incredibly ambitious Energy Infrastructure Roadmap to deliver 12 GW of new transmission capacity, increasing the state’s renewable energy penetration to over 60% by 2030.
“Much of [Australia’s] progress was driven by state and territory governments, which introduced a number of world-leading renewable energy policies and targets in 2020. However, the states and territories’ progressive energy policies only served to highlight the ongoing failures at the federal level, where arguments about government support for gas and coal overshadowed some genuinely positive developments,” Chief Executive Thornton said.
Clean Energy Council
“An enormous amount of new clean energy capacity was added in 2020 as both the rooftop solar and wind sectors set new annual records. Emerging technologies also made rapid progress, with several major utility-scale battery announcements and considerable investment in renewable hydrogen building strong momentum for these exciting new technologies,” Thornton added.
The Council noted while the rate of new large-scale renewable energy projects reaching financial commitment remained steady in 2020, it was lower than the records reached in 2017 and 2018.
In terms of challenges, Australia’s grid connection and transmission issues persist, plaguing renewable energy developers in 2020. “While the market bodies made some progress on resolving these challenges throughout the year, much more work and investment is required to ensure that Australia’s clean energy transition can continue,” the report noted.
Hydrogen benefited from its inclusion in the Federal Government’s Technology Investment Roadmap, as well as from upped investment from states and territories which collectively poured millions into pilot projects and new initiatives in 2020.
“A further 76 large-scale wind and solar projects were under construction at the end of 2020, representing more than 8 GW of new capacity and employing over 9000 Australian workers,” the report said. “Of these projects, 49 were large-scale solar farms, 21 were wind farms, three were bioenergy plants, while three were hybrid plants producing at least two different types of renewable energy.”

On Monday, the carmaker unveiled its $7.4 million Hydrogen Centre, which includes Victoria’s first commercial-grade permanent hydrogen production, storage and refuelling facility as well as education centre.
The hydrogen production facility is powered by an 87 kW solar array along with 100 kW of battery storage. It will produce up to 80kg of hydrogen on site everyday with its 200 kW electrolyser. The hydrogen will then be stored in a bank of storage tubes at medium and high pressure to be able to refuel commercial and passenger hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (HFCEVs), like Toyota’s Mirai FCEV. The station is capable of filling a Toyota Mirai in approximately 3 minutes, giving the vehicle a range of 650km.
While Toyota’s Mirai model is not on general sale in Australia, it has been sold in Japan and US for the past seven years. Toyota noted the lack of refuelling infrastructure as one of the main hurdles to bringing FCEVs to the Australian market, saying the new centre is an important step in addressing the challenge.
To get its Mirai HFCEV on Australians roads, the company has partnered with Victorian businesses to lease fleets of the hydrogen-powered vehicles. According to partner BOC’s statement, Toyota is also organising a HFCEV fleet trial in Western Australia.
In addition to the passenger cars, Toyota also uses fuel-cell forklifts in parts of the Altona complex, which will be powered by the hydrogen produced on site.
BOC
Last week, Neoen and ActewAGL opened Australia’s first hydrogen vehicle refuelling station in Canberra, catering to the state government’s new fleet of Hyundai Nexo hydrogen cars.
Toyota’s hydrogen refuelling station at its former car manufacturing site, which closed in 2017, was installed by gas and engineering company BOC, a subsidiary of Linde plc, which has installed 180 hydrogen refuelling stations worldwide, refuelling around 1.5 million cars.
While hydrogen seems to be 2021’s hottest buzzword, questions about its role for passenger vehicles remain. Professor Ray Wills, Managing Director and owner of Future Smart Strategies, says it’s “unlikely” hydrogen will manage to overtake batteries as the preferred transport fuel.
“Hydrogen as transport fuel is still a long way behind lithium batteries,” Professor Wills told pv magazine Australia.
With the massive amounts of energy, attention and, most importantly, funding being poured into hydrogen – especially in Australia – many remain hopeful about the fuel’s potential markets.
Professor Ray Wills
Given hydrogen as a transport fuel is only just finding its feet in Australia, Toyota’s Hydrogen Centre, which was developed with $3.1 million of funding support from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), is focussed on demonstrating possibilities as much as it is about refuelling actual cars.
Toyota Australia’s President and CEO Matthew Callachor said the Toyota Hydrogen Centre was built to showcase the benefits of hydrogen fuel cell technology.
“By demonstrating the viability of renewably-produced hydrogen as an automotive and energy fuel through this project, Toyota and its partners in government and business are pioneering a cleaner, more sustainable future that will encourage the further acceptance of this technology.”
“The infrastructure which is being commissioned at this new Toyota facility will not only progress the deployment of hydrogen vehicles, which can make a major contribution to helping our transport sector navigate Australia’s energy transition, but it will also serve as a beacon to other companies looking to invest in hydrogen transport technology,” Dr Patrick Hartley, from the CSIRO Hydrogen Industry Mission, said at the Centre’s opening.
Toyota has committed to achieving zero CO2 emissions from its vehicles and plants under the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050. To reach its target, the company has invested heavily in installing solar arrays in key properties in Sydney, Altona, and Brisbane.
The largest system is installed on the Toyota Parts Centre in Western Sydney, featuring a 605kW solar array made up of 2,200 panels.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/30/queensland-scientists-remarkable-renewably-powered-carbon-capture-breakthrough/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",BLAKE MATICH,"MARCH 30, 2021",Queensland scientists’ remarkable renewably powered carbon capture breakthrough,"Researchers from the Queensland University of Technology have made a remarkable breakthrough with the development of an electrochemical process in which carbon dioxide is captured from the air and stored in water as a non-toxic calcium carbonate (chalk) in a renewably powered process that could also produce green hydrogen and decarbonise the cement industry. 
PhD researcher Olawale Oloye and Professor Anthony O’Mullane from the QUT Centre for Clean Energy Technologies and Practices developed the process of capturing and converting carbon dioxide through a mineralization approach that seems to produce a host of serendipitous by-products. 

According to O’Mullane, the “process involves the capture of CO2 by its reaction with an alkaline solution produced on demand, to form solid carbonate products which can be used, for example, as construction materials, thereby keeping carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. This can be done using a simple calcium source in water.”
It is also important to note that the QUT researchers used seawater instead of potable water as potable water is too precious a resource for large-scale carbon capture, especially in Australia. “We found we could use seawater once it had been treated to remove sulphates. To do this we first precipitated calcium sulphate or gypsum, another building material, and then carried out the same process to successfully turn CO2 into calcium carbonate, thus providing proof of concept of a circular carbon economy.”
“Next,” continues O’Mullane, ” the hydrogen evolution reaction during electrolysis ensured that the electrode was continually renewed to keep the electrochemical reaction going while also generating another valuable product, green hydrogen.This means if this electrolysis process is powered by renewable electricity, we are producing green hydrogen alongside the calcium carbonate (CaCO3).” 
This is to say, not only does the process capture and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but it also generates a green fuel source capable of decarbonising pesky industrial sectors like heavy-transport, manufacturing, and indeed the entire energy sector of export partners like Japan. 
Indeed, O’Mullane said the use of renewable energy to capture CO2 and create calcium carbonate may be of use in the cement industry, which is one of the peskier industries to decarbonise, and an industry that is only going to continue in rapid growth as urbanisation increases over the course of the century. 
“We envision this technology would benefit emission-intensive industries such as the cement industry whose CO2 footprint is 7-10% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions…“By coupling the mineralization process to produce CaCO3 from the emitted CO2 during the clinking step we could create a closed loop system and reduce a significant percentage of the CO2 involved in cement production.”
“Electrochemical Capture and Storage of CO2 as Calcium Carbonate” can be read here and was published in the journal ChemSusChem.

The webinar takes place on Thursday, 1 April 2021 from 4 pm – 5 pm AEDT, Sydney | 1 pm – 2 pm AWDT, Perth / CST, Beijing, Singapore| 10.30 am – 11.30 am IST, Delhi. Register here. 
pv magazine Australia: Larger format modules such as the 210mm are the talk of the town at the moment, and Trina Solar is right at the centre of attention with its spate of new larger models. Are the larger formats a passing craze or will they become industry standard?  
Andrew Gilhooly, Assistant Director TrinaPro Business APAC: Well, at least from a tracker perspective, I can say that in the large wafer format the Watts per module is high but the number of cells is fewer, leading to reduced operating voltage. This enables us to run much longer strings, up to 40 modules in a string in higher temperature locations which can unlock considerable downstream savings on electrical BOS such as fewer home run cables to make off, fewer combiner boxes to procure and install with accordingly fewer linear metres of DC trenching and so forth.  In markets with higher prevailing labor rates like Australia we’ve found these savings can exceed one cent per Watt peak which has been corroborated by independent third parties.
And in a more general perspective, we foresee 210mm will rapidly gain acceptance and become the preferred choice by customers – given  the higher power bin the modules can achieve with 210mm cell.
Are rooftop solar customers also preferring larger formats?  
This is dependent on the type of rooftops and project sizes. We have customers using the 19 series – up to 550W for their rooftop projects.
As you mentioned trackers, Trina Solar has also introduced two new trackers compatible with the larger formats, are these trackers compatible with larger modules across the industry?
With being a first mover to large format modules, we had early visibility on the module form factor becoming increasingly large, which is important considering the modules are now approximately 20% longer than the 500W ones.  This is pertinent because the module sail area increases and accordingly so does the intensity of the wind loading into the structure given the non linear relationship between wind load and height, which is further accentuated on 2 portrait trackers which sit higher from the ground.
As the only module manufacturer to offer an integrated PV and tracker solution, we were able to spend longer performing our full aero elastic wind tunnel testing regime in conjunction with pre eminent wind consultancy RWDI.  This involved, firstly, ensuring unequivocally that the tracker structure holds up to every possible wind load combination, including complex 2nd order dynamic effects, which are even more pronounced as string length and therefore tracker length increases. Ultimately, we were able to  completely ameliorate this and ensure our trackers could accommodate these longer 210mm module strings by implementing a multi point drive system.  And then secondly, we were able to implement a value engineering approach to optimise things like material usage, gauge thickness and especially the foundation count, which can now be as low as 100 piles per MW DC, unlocking more considerable savings on sites with challenging geotechnical characteristics and especially so in high labor cost markets like Australia.  All this enables our customers to attain not only super competitive supply pricing but ultimately also lower fully installed turnkey capex.
We also made sure the boundary conditions utilised in the wind tunnel testing were future proofed for future module form factor changes including the recent introduction of 650W+ modules from both Trina and our competitors in the module space.
In the upcoming edition of pv magazine PVInfoLink stressed the importance of innovation in the transport sector, and this week I see Trina Solar has come up with a novel approach for packing modules into shipping containers. Can you tell us about it?   
Conventional loading is based on horizontal placement and 2 stack. At Trina Solar we’ve managed to design a  vertical placement solution for the large size modules so it will fit into the 40HC container with 18 pallets. As with any design improvement or saving on the transport side this solution is will help us save a great deal of money, savings we can pass on to the customer.
The utility-scale solar sector is going big over the next decade, in Asia Pacific especially, what do you see as the major trends that we will continue to see?  
There are a number of exciting and disruptive opportunities in utility solar right now. One topic particularly close to my heart from living in Victoria, which is referred to as the food bowl of Australia, is the potential for dual solar and agriculture, not simply grazing sheep but truly integrated land uses where land owners can create energy as green as the crops they produce, and our trackers enable this Agrivoltaic approach as we have done on numerous Top Runner projects in China.
There’s also much talk about using renewables to create green steel and capitalising on Australia’s abundant natural resources to become an export power house again, and as a father of two young kids the opportunity to create thousands of industrial Australian jobs in the future is very exciting.  On this same note we are exploring local procurement and fabrication opportunities for the tracker steelwork to be locally sourced within Australia.
We are also looking to disrupt the industry on our next generation trackers utilising things such as predictive maintenance for O&M utilising IOT sensors, automated tracker and module assembly.  In terms of the wider APAC region, which historically has preferred fixed structure solutions over trackers, we’ve seen a real spike in interest with the value stacking potential of bifacial PV onto trackers.  And as the bid pricing has continued to decline to the super low pricing we’ve seen in India, we see developers and IPPs who own and operate over the long term truly value the higher and more assured long term energy outcome from a trusted solution provider like Trina, as opposed to opting for lowest capex approaches, and we very much expect this trend to continue within the wider region.

Then the company announced that construction on its 250 MW one-hour-duration battery at the site of its Torrens Island power station in South Australia is now underway. This week, AGL has kept its foot on the proverbial gas (soon to be only proverbial) by entering a joint venture with the United Kingdom’s (UK) zero carbon brand, Ovo. 
The partnership will see AGL receive exclusive Australian access to Ovo’s vaunted customer experience platform, Kaluza. Kaluza is an AI-enabled platform that not only provides customers with an intuitive energy account, but gives retailers the ability to transform their operations. As an energy management system that can also run the charging of electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage systems, and other home and IOT devices, this partnership has the potential to save both AGL and AGL customers a good deal of cash while also helping the transition away from fossil fuels. 
Along with the spate of recent announcements from AGL, not merely its hustle on the large-scale energy storage front, but also the company’s recent acquisitions of Epho and Solgen Energy Group – making it the largest commercial solar provider in Australia – clearly the old firm is dragging itself into the 21st Century, and the digitisation of its services is a concerted part of that effort. 
Thanks to Australia’s world-leading rooftop solar penetration, and as evidenced by the recently revealed plans of the AEMC regarding a solar export tax, the ability to manage our energy at the level of the individual home is becoming ever more important. AGL says Kaluza’s advanced software is primed to help towards solving these grid challenges by intelligently shifting device charging to times of lower demand. 
BloombergNEF predicts solar installations in Australia will only continue to increase, offsetting rising demand from air conditioning and EVs. 
“While the shift to renewables is driving decarbonisation of the power sector, the hard work of tackling carbon emissions in the rest of the economy, in particular the residential sector, is just beginning” said Stephen Fitzpatrick, CEO and founder of Ovo. “Ultimately, success will come down to turning consumers into willing, active participants in the energy transition. Companies must now focus on building trust with their customers, harnessing technology that makes zero carbon living simple and affordable for everyone. The Kaluza platform uses real-time data to create a uniquely personalised digital experience, making it easy for the customer to engage with energy and their own carbon footprint.” 
AGL’s managing director and CEO, Brett Redman, added that Kaluza represented the addition of world-class technology and innovation to Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/30/we-need-an-energy-access-revolution-a-new-approach-to-innovation-can-help/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,SOUTH AFRICA,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA",,"MARCH 30, 2021",We need an energy access revolution: A new approach to innovation can help,"From pv magazine Global. 
The energy sector is currently undergoing the greatest revolution since the Coal Age gave way to the Oil Age. New technologies are radically transforming the economics of delivering power. Over the past decade, the cost of delivering power to people living off-grid through standalone solar and storage mini grids has decreased by up to 85%.
The World Bank believes mini grids will be the cheapest way to bring power to half a billion people, most of whom live in rural communities and would be considered low-income on any global scale. But although mini grids are already cheaper than the main grid in many areas, they are still too expensive to profitably connect these potential customers.
There is an opportunity for a new revolution in energy access. As governments consider ways to rebuild the global economy, investing in mini grids is critical to driving equitable economic growth and a climate positive future. To achieve this seismic shift, we need to unleash innovation.
Private mini grid companies are working to incrementally innovate the business model. However, it’s not happening fast enough. To speed up innovation and unlock revolutionary change, the Rockefeller Foundation seeded the Mini-Grid Innovation Lab.
The Mini-Grid Innovation Lab is pioneering a new approach to innovation in energy access. Launched in 2018, the lab identifies the most promising innovations by field testing prototype innovations in an iterative process and evaluating which have the greatest impact on the business model. The lab is funded with public money and donor funds, and makes its findings public, sharing innovations directly with companies and governments to spread the knowledge.
The lab consists of 25 private mini grid companies, working in collaboration together. It accelerates the speed of innovation by working through these 25 private actors, combining the strengths of public and private sector innovation.
Every quarter, the lab convenes these 25 private mini grid companies to identify and design innovations to test within their own businesses and among their own customers. It then funds these private sector companies to test the innovations, on the condition they share the resulting data with the lab to distribute with the entire private sector.
The lab aggregates the data across all companies and analyses it to determine the impact on the business model. It makes its findings publicly available, for free, to the entire sector, and continually repeats this process of idea gathering, testing, and sharing to rapidly accelerate sector innovation.
In a simple model, innovation can emerge in two ways:
Each model involves trade-offs.
Private sector companies are often the best engines of short-term innovation, because the incentive to survive is highly motivating. These companies are also the best judge of the most relevant solutions given they’re closest to the problems. However, we can’t rely on private companies to scale innovation to other companies in the sector. It’s not in their market interest to do so. In fact, it’s in their interest to stop the spread of innovation.
Apple’s seven-year pursuit of Samsung for patent violations was only settled last year for several hundred million dollars. Every smart phone is slightly more expensive and slightly lower quality than it could be, because each private sector actor is jealously guarding its competitive advantage.
An SSIR article last year raised this issue with private sector innovation in Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) solar, noting “Mutual awareness is low, and meaningful coordination is even more uncommon. This applies to collaboration…between companies and organisations working within the same sector.”
Public sector innovation is, by definition, public. Unlike their private counterparts, public actors make their innovations widely available – they share all information for the market to act on. Public actors can also be more patient and direct large amounts of risk capital towards innovation without a return expectation.
But public actors are typically further from the problem and are also inherently less incentivised to drive toward a ‘product’ or solution that will reach the hands of a customer in need. None of the government agencies working on the technologies behind the iPhone integrated them into a commercial smartphone. Public innovation is shared but is slow and disconnected from end users’ real challenges.
The traditional paradigm of innovation presents a choice. Fast but proprietary and therefore siloed. Or, shared but slow and isolated from the end-user. The lab is pioneering a new model that captures the best of both models. It provides donor funding to private sector actors to test agreed innovations on the condition that they share the results back with all their competitors.
Through this approach, the lab combines the strengths of private sector innovation – speed and relevant knowledge of the problem – and public sector innovation – patient funding and open dissemination of knowledge. To make this real, it’s helpful to consider an example.
Grain milling is one of the most important productive uses of energy for people living off-grid in rural Africa. Maize is the most commonly produced cereal in sub-Saharan Africa, and grain millers use that maize to produce flour, a key ingredient in staple foods for rural communities.
Powering grain mills with solar mini grids would transform the off-grid energy sector, delivering clean, reliable, 24/7 power to rural businesses. However, diesel mills dominate the rural off-grid market, because no solar-powered electric mill exists that can match them on both cost and performance.
To solve this, the lab brought together a coalition of private sector and public sector partners to iterate on the off-grid electric mill until it could match its diesel rival. It ran the following process:
The lab is now applying this innovation approach to other promising tools to drive down capital expenditure costs and drive-up revenues. It is conducting field trials deploying smart inverters, reducing electricity tariffs, bulk procuring hardware, and bundling internet with power across Tanzania, Kenya, Nigeria, and Zambia.
The lab is also partnering with advocacy experts, technology companies, financiers, and on-the-ground implementing partners to scale those innovations proven successful. With Rockefeller’s support, it will share its findings with key governments, donors, and investors needed to accelerate this scale.
The lab is field testing 10 innovations that together could make mini grids commercially viable by reducing capex per connection from US$1,000 to $500 and increasing average revenue per user (ARPU) from $5 to $17 per month
If these trials are successfully scaled, this new approach will have dramatically accelerated progress towards universal electrification in Africa. It will have sparked a new revolution in energy access, giving poor, rural communities across the continent access to affordable and reliable power for the first time.
We believe the lab represents an interesting new model of innovation that combines the strengths of both private and public sector innovation. This approach could have a similar impact in other sectors where advancing public good requires private sector innovation.
Donors could support innovation labs in smallholder farming, microfinance, and transport. Combining the speed and relevance of private sector innovation with the broad dissemination and funding of public sector innovation offers a way to ‘innovate on innovation’.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/30/youtube-a-proven-marketing-platform-to-expand-solar-businesses/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",PV MAGAZINE,"MARCH 30, 2021",YouTube – a proven marketing platform to expand solar businesses,"From pv magazine USA
The solar industry has seen unprecedented development as one of the top two renewable energy sources with continued growth in 2021. The future of solar technology remains bright, but as a solar business owner, you may be left wondering how to tap into the expanding market in order to grow your solar business.
YouTube videos are becoming a vital part of consumers’ solar-buying journey, providing a unique opportunity for solar marketers. The platform can be used to keep your solar business relevant by creating exclusive content and informational videos that establish yourself as an expert in your field.
Videos can then be used to direct potential clients to your other social channels, website, or both. Consumers are turning to YouTube to understand the process of going solar, and when they are ready to buy, they will turn to the expert they have come to trust – you.
My research into the ins and outs of solar marketing comes through years of placing my focus exclusively on solar, testing strategies for reaching quality leads, and investing time and money as I grew my marketing company.
Multiple leads
There was a time when platforms such as Facebook provided multiple leads for very little cost. But, as time went on, my team and I found both the cost for solar ads and competition on social media was increasing. In 2019, a dramatic shift began to occur as thousands of solar companies began advertising on Facebook in all of the same markets.
Solar companies in California, Texas, Florida, Nevada, and Arizona were all directly competing to get leads on Facebook. The cost per acquisition began to steadily increase and at any given time there could be up to 150,000 solar ads competing for the same client base. In addition, Facebook began to increase its prices.
You might have found some success by following a marketing plan founded in Facebook advertising, but we aren’t here to discuss staying stagnant. You are looking to expand your business, and to do so you need to think outside the box. That’s exactly what we did, and our own solar company made the switch to YouTube. Our retention rate grew from 35% to 93%.
We switched our solar marketing clients over to YouTube as well, where their businesses began to grow while other companies were still relying on Facebook for cheap clickbait. But why exactly is YouTube so successful for solar marketers?
The platform has more than 1.9 billion monthly users, and those considering solar projects are turning to YouTube for research. YouTube ads create an optimal balance for high-quality leads and appointments at cost-effective price points. When we switched our marketing clients, we began to see lead costs similar to five years ago because the majority of solar companies are not marketing their brand on YouTube.
Content creation
YouTube is your chance to make your business stand out. The digital market is flooded with many solar companies in any given market, but few are taking the time to educate their consumer base on the ins and outs of solar energy.
Separate yourself from the competition, whose only concern seems to be catching the eye with gimmicks and slogans, by explaining the value of investing in solar. In doing so, you will find high-quality clients ready and capable of spending money. This results in your business growing and profit margin increasing.
A few points that you may want to address with potential customers through your videos include:
There are numerous topics within those categories that provide a foundation for you to generate content. The possibilities are endless: financing options, how panels protect a roof, the effects of solar panels on a home’s value, or whatever your heart desires.
Don’t stop at just a few videos. Make use of YouTube to clearly communicate your expertise and stay on trend with a series of videos. Consumers are seeking bite-sized segments they can watch quickly and understand easily. Create videos separately in subcategories that keep viewers engaged and wanting more.
A series of videos also will help your company take advantage of how YouTube works. Its recommendation algorithms are set up to promote your other videos after a viewer has watched the first one. By creating a series of videos, you are more likely to hold the attention of the viewer once they discover your first video.
Call to action
After creating captivating and educational content, you are ready to start driving highly qualified clients to your social media and website. Making use of all platforms is important, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google listings, a website, email, blogs, and even podcasts.
The goal of marketing on YouTube is to use it as a vehicle to drive traffic to your other social channels. YouTube makes this easy to do by adding highly visible links at the bottom right-hand corner of your channel.
However, it is important to take it a step further and ask your audience to continue to interact with your video channel, otherwise known as a “call to action.” There are several ways you can do this, from asking your audience to click on your video to suggesting they post any comments or questions they may have. It is hard to know which call to action will work best until you give a few of them a try.
Investing in the right marketing plan can pay dividends in the long run. Marketing is the key to every successful brand, business, and organisation.

Electric cars are pretty heavy and, therefore, need quite a bit of energy to move. The culprit, is the battery. But what if the chassis itself was rechargeable, rather than a battery added to the structure?
Researchers from the Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, and the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm claim to have taken a significant stride towards making that vision a reality. The ‘massless’ batteries envisioned–so called because their weight is not added on top of a vehicle structure–have been the subject of research since 2007. The Swedish researchers say their discovery has improved such devices by a factor of ten.
Their battery features a carbon fibre negative electrode and a positive electrode made from lithium-ion-phosphate-coated aluminium foil. A fibreglass fabric separates the components which are then woven, like ordinary carbon fibre, and surrounded by an electrolyte matrix. The matrix consisted of a porous methacrylate polymer which the researchers impregnated with a liquid electrolyte of lithium salts, for high ionic conductivity.
The team has said their eureka! moment arrived through happy accident. Initially, the group had attempted to investigate the structural effects of separator thickness only to discover their approach resulted in a battery ten times better than other ‘structural’–or ‘massless’–batteries. With an energy density of 24 Wh/kg, their structural battery has just 20% of the figure boasted by conventional lithium-ion batteries. However, because the weight of a vehicle using such devices would be significantly reduced, that is of no great concern, the researchers said.
To illustrate the point, the Swedish team pointed out the 85 kWh battery in a Tesla Model S makes up around a quarter of the vehicle’s weight. Plus, with massless batteries storing lower energy than conventional devices, they also comprise less of a safety risk.
In flexibility terms, the device was tested for an elastic modulus of 25 gigapascals and tensile strength exceeding 300 megapascals, and can thus compete with common construction materials, according to the researchers. “Previous attempts to make structural batteries have resulted in cells with either good mechanical properties or good electrical properties,” said Leif Asp, professor at Chalmers and leader of the project. “But here, using carbon fibre, we have succeeded in designing a structural battery with both competitive energy storage capacity and rigidity.”
With their results having been achieved by accident, the academics believe there is room for improvement. Asp suggested an energy density of around 75 Wh/kg and a stiffness of 75 gigapascals could be within reach. Electrochemical performance is limited by the mass of active materials relative to  total mass. That means achieving a higher proportion of fibres to electrolyte would improve battery performance and a more refined industrial manufacturing process could improve the fibre-to-electrolyte ratio drastically.
In terms of cycling stability, the researchers have claimed their device showed no significant capacity degradation signs after 60 cycles.
“The next-generation structural battery has fantastic potential,” said Asp. “If you look at consumer technology, it could be quite possible, within a few years, to manufacture smartphones, laptops or electric bicycles that weigh half as much as today and are much more compact.”

The costs of lithium-ion battery storage have decreased 97% since commercial market introduction in 1991, according to MIT researchers who have presented a new methodological approach to support their claim previous models underestimated the reduction.
To arrive at their conclusion, the researchers incorporated more data series and metrics into their price calculations. Standard models consider only the price per energy capacity decline (in dollars per kilowatt-hour). The MIT group, however, considered extra data points, including specific energy and energy density figures, to better determine how much lithium-ion technology has improved. The first striking result from their research was that lithium-ion batteries improved at a much faster pace than previously assumed.
For example, from 1992 to 2016, the researchers added energy capacity and energy density to standard cost development considerations. They concluded the annual average cost decline, measured in ‘real price per service’, was around 17%, not 13% as previously estimated. The price per service is the dollar figure per energy capacity unit as a function of volume per energy capacity unit. Factoring energy density into the calculation produced the higher, 17% figure.
Measured by standard means, the learning rate for lithium-ion batteries–the rate of cost reduction for each doubling of cumulative market volume–is understood to be around 24% for cylindrical cells and 20% for other cell types. The MIT group, however, factored in extra metrics and observed a bump to 30% and 26%, respectively. The change was partly attributed to the previous estimate featuring a problem in accounting for the number of cells brought to market. That occurred because different cell sizes were produced for different applications, muddying the waters when comparing different devices in a standard price-progress model.
The findings led the MIT group to believe reported improvement rates may have underestimated the battery technology’s fast-paced development. “Moreover, our improvement-rate estimates suggest the degree to which lithium-ion technologies’ price decline might have been limited by performance requirements other than cost-per-energy-capacity,” the scientists wrote.
Collecting data from articles, reports, academic presentations, government publications and business literature enabled the researchers to incorporate additional data points into a more comprehensive cost development model. The group systematically collected, harmonized and combined various data series related to price, market size, research and development, and the performance of lithium-ion technologies.
The analysis syndicated 90 data series related to price, market size, patent filings, cell-level energy density, and the specific energy developments of lithium-ion batteries. The researchers suggested their more comprehensive approach should be used when compiling future datasets.
The research article Re-examining rates of lithium-ion battery technology improvement and cost decline appeared in Energy & Environmental Science.
