Why isn’t there solar on every rooftop?,"This part of Australia is dangerously hot in summer. And many people don’t have enough power to run vital appliances like the fridge and air conditioner.
Solar would be an ideal solution. Tennant Creek has over 300 days per year of sunshine with some of the clearest skies in the world, for instance.
Only recently, co-author and Warumungu elder Frank Jupurrurla took part in the first NT rooftop solar trial, supported by Original Power and installed rooftop solar on his house.
As our new research found, this pilot worked well, supplying a third of the house’s power and ending the problem of power disconnecting. Previously, the power would go out once a month on average. After solar, it never went off.
So why isn’t this widely available? The main problems are red tape, such as getting approval for work on public housing, securing feed in tariffs and metering requirements. As Jupurrurla’s experience demonstrates, they can all be overcome – but not easily.
As Frank Jupurrurla says: “We call the sun Kilyirr […] Right now he’s shining on my panels, he’s giving me power, and he looks after us. So that Kilyirr, he gonna be there forever.”

Prepaid electricity is used in many remote First Nations households across Australia, and in almost all town camps. In this model, people “top up” the meter with credit. When credit runs out, the electricity disconnects until more credit is purchased. The electricity here is often produced by diesel generators.
Despite the risk of sudden disconnection, this model is often preferred by many communities as it gives residents fewer surprise bills. The downside is it often leads to an unenviable choice – power or food.
For residents of Tennant Creek’s town camps, it is not uncommon to run out of credit on a hot day. The hotter the day, the higher the chance people will lose power. That’s because hotter weather forces air conditioners and fridges to work harder.
When the power goes off, food inside fridges starts to spoil. Essential medical devices such as oxygen concentrators stop operating. Medications can become inactive or even toxic.
Air conditioners stop working and temperatures rise. On very hot days, the inside of a house gets well over 40℃. Children and adults can’t sleep. Going to school gets harder. Not only are these conditions unsafe, they can drive social disharmony.
As Frank Jupurrurla says: “We struggle every day. Our people, they’re not healthy. Lots of people in this town are on renal [dialysis]. Solar should be talked about in parliament and put on the table.”
A 6.6 kW solar array was installed on Frank Jupurrurla’s house and switched on in November 2021. The house kept its grid connection and no battery was installed. Household residents received a crash course from the installers, First Nations organisation Original Power, on making the most of the solar for example by running the washing machine during daylight hours.
The result? Solar generates a third of the total power use in any given month. But more importantly, through reducing energy costs, disconnections stopped entirely. This removed a huge source of stress and made the home safer and more enjoyable, according to the family.
As Frank Jupurrurla says: “We used to put a lot of power cards in nearly every day, second day. Now we got money all the time since we’ve got solar.”

It sounds simple: install a 6.6 kW array and see what difference it made. After all, people in the cities can do this routinely.
But it’s harder far from the cities, and harder still when different government departments have to sign off. As Jupurrurla describes: “The barriers was from the day we started. Before that, we’d argue with [Department of] Housing, and they said we have to check inside and check if the house is strong enough. Once we had the panels on, then it took us a while to [turn] it on. It was pretty frustrating. It took Power and Water more than three months just to switch the switch on. It was so hard. I rang the housing minister but nothing happened. So one day I just went out there to the box and switched it on myself.”
Installing solar here meant overcoming regulatory barriers such as securing feed-in tariffs for excess power produced, ensuring the public housing is high-quality enough to host solar, and the question of ownership of the panels.
The NT housing department required an engineer’s sign off on the roof’s structural integrity, as this can’t be assumed for remote public housing.
As Jupurrurla’s experience demonstrates, these barriers can be overcome – but not easily.
Our trial shows solar can work well for remote communities. The timing is good, as the ongoing roll-out of smart prepay meters means most remote First Nations houses in the NT are able to handle solar.
For this to gain momentum, the NT government must find ways to overcome these barriers. The Territory government has responsibilities as both the landlord for housing and as the monopoly energy provider.
A key first step would be to smooth the path with clear paperwork and incentives for prepay households to install solar.

Just as in the cities, encouraging solar will require financial incentives to offset the upfront cost, with culturally appropriate resources available in First Nations languages to explain the process.
Feed-in tariffs have long driven demand for solar for many homeowners. Ensuring remote communities are eligible will be vital.
Australian households are world leaders in taking up solar. But for too long, the ability to generate your own power from the sun has been off limits to many of the people who would benefit the most.
This year is an excellent time to correct this, as the federal government works towards a co-designed First Nations Clean Energy Strategy and the NT government’s plans for better power solutions in remote communities.
As Frank Jupurrurla says: “I’d like to see government fund […] panels on homes. Especially in the Community Living Areas [town camps] in places like Alice Springs, Tenant Creek, and Katherine.”

The Series A funding round was led by Kolkata-based Himadri, Artesian, and Electrification & Decarbonization AIE LP, a fund managed by Canada-based Waratah Capital Advisers. New York-headquartered Riverstone Ventures, Chaos Ventures, Investible Climate Tech Fund LP and Club Investible also participated in the funding round.
Sicona is working to commercialise its high-capacity silicon anode technology which has been flagged as a possible game-changer for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries that dominate the electric vehicle (EV) and renewable energy storage market.
Sicona Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Christiaan Jordaan said the company’s silicon-composite anode technology delivers 50-100% higher capacity than conventional graphite anodes and its anode materials can deliver significantly higher cell energy density than current Li-ion batteries.
“Sicona’s core product is an innovative silicon metal-based silicon-composite battery anode technology enabling more than 50% increase in energy density of existing Li-ion batteries,” he said. “By using silicon metal, and not expensive, supply chain constrained and dangerous silane gas like our competitors, Sicona can offer low-cost silicon anode materials at large automotive scale locally in major markets.”
Jordaan said the latest funding round will allow Sicona, which has its headquarters and pilot plant based in Wollongong, just south of Sydney, to further its plans to establish a battery component manufacturing site in the United States where demand for anode materials is estimated to exceed 1,200 GWh by 2030.
“Due to significant interest in our materials from North American automotive companies, we are focusing our efforts on building Sicona’s first commercial-scale manufacturing plant in the U.S.,” Jordann said, noting that the support of Himadri “allows us to accelerate our mission of becoming a major producer of cost-effective silicon composite anode materials.”
“Himadri has a multi-decade track record of manufacturing materials at scale and their expertise and inputs will be a major asset to us in the next phases of our growth plans,” he said.
Sicona is already moving on the establishment of a U.S. manufacturing plant, having earlier this year appointed engineering and construction firm Bechtel to conduct an engineering study.
Sicona said it is now advancing those studies, site selection and customer qualification for the plant which is expected to be built in the southeast of the U.S. to serve customers in the that market with Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) compliant materials supply.
It is anticipated the plant will initially be capable of producing about five kilo tonnes per annum (ktpa) of silicon-carbon material, before scaling up to 20 ktpa.

The MEG HP1 project aims to build on the existing 11 MW Northam Solar Farm with the addition of a 10 MW hydrogen electrolyser and battery energy storage. Once fully operational, the facility is expected to produce up to four tonnes of green hydrogen per day for the medium and heavy transport industry.
The developers have confirmed that the scope is there to expand the solar facility to 18 MW, potentially doubling the site’s production capacity to eight tonnes of green hydrogen daily with the first production expected in early 2025.
The joint development agreement sees Doral – which says it has a portfolio of more than 500 renewable projects in operation worldwide with a pipeline totalling more than 18 GW – take a stake of undisclosed size for an undisclosed sum in the MEG HP1 project.
IGE Chief Executive Officer Stephen Gauld said the agreement underlines the potential of the development and will allow it to progress the Northam project to final investment decision (FID).
“Partnering with a global renewable energy partner such as Doral Group will continue to build the confidence of our shareholders, strategic partners, and buyers of our future fuel,” he said.

Gauld said the joint development agreement outlines the strategic partnership between IGE, Doral and Samsung C&T, including the key terms, advancing detailed design, and the milestones to successfully achieve a FID.
The front-end engineering and design (FEED) has already been completed for the project and a final investment decision is expected before the end of 2023 with the first green hydrogen supply expected in the first quarter of 2025 following the commissioning of the project.
The project will focus on domestic hydrogen consumers with the project to include a loading terminal for trucks to supply local operations.
IGE said it already has offtake agreements in place and binding contracts under negotiation, with some of the site’s output to be used by waste management companies for back-to-base refuse collection and fleet vehicles.
The MEG HP1 is the most advanced of IGE’s projects with the company also progressing the Arrowsmith Hydrogen Project, which it says will produce up to 25 tonnes of green hydrogen daily.

The deal will see SmartestEnergy, an electricity retailer owned by Japanese investment company Marubeni, purchase electricity from the project, although neither company involved in the power purchase agreement (PPA) provided details as to the amount of power, or the length of the arrangement.
In a statement, SmartestEnergy only said it will purchase “a substantial portion of the solar farm’s electricity output over a long-term period” which it will then retail to its commercial and industrial customer base in Australia.
SmartestEnergy Australia Chief Executive Officer Robert Owens said the offtake agreement will grow the company’s renewable energy portfolio and allow it to expand its product offering.
“In Australia, solar and energy storage solutions are key to a sustainable energy future. Long-term deals like the new Kingaroy PPA not only help ensure new assets are built in Australia but also enable the delivery of clean energy for decades to come,” he said.
Mytilineos said the Kingaroy Solar Farm is now in the final stage of construction and the project is expected to begin commercial operations in “late 2023” with the output enough to power the equivalent of 16,000 Australian homes.
The developer noted that a portion of the funds raised from the SmartestEnergy PPA will be invested into completing the construction of the facility and progressing Mytilineos’ renewables build-out strategy in the Australian market.
The Kingaroy project is one of three Australian solar farms Mytilineos reached financial close on earlier this year as it continues to develop its solar pipeline in the country.
The company said its Australian portfolio totals 376 MW with most projects supported by long-term offtake agreements. These include deals with the Queensland government-owned generator CS Energy, supermarket giant Coles, and publicly owned telecommunications company NBN Co.

Solar in Southeast Asia is set for a rebound, following a two-year market contraction triggered by Vietnam’s abrupt suspension of its generous feed-in-tariff regime in 2020, the Asian Photovoltaic Industry Association (APVIA) and the Global Solar Council (GSC) say in a new report, published in collaboration with SolarPower Europe.
Annual capacity additions are expected to hit 3.8 GW in 2023, up 13% from the previous year. In 2021, the market contracted by 68% to 4.2 GW of annual additions. But now, favourable policy frameworks, declining technology costs, and increasing electricity demand now point to growth opportunities in Southeast Asia.
“New capacity is well distributed across different countries and the regional market no longer depends on one single contributor, [i.e. Vietnam],” said the APVIA and the GSC.
However, uncertainty remains, as several countries are now at a turning point in their solar stories. The report said it remains to be seen just how quickly they can deploy solar. The region also faces challenges related to grid infrastructure, access to financing, land availability, and lack of a skilled workforce. According to the report’s “high” scenario, regional installations could hit 5.7 GW in 2023, or contract to 2.5 GW under a “low” scenario.
“Starting from 2024, a high pace of growth is expected across the region,” the APVIA and the GSC said. Annual installations are forecasted to grow 32% to reach 5.1 GW in 2024, 59% to 8.1 GW in 2025, 28% to 10.4 GW in 2026, finally hitting 13.3 GW of new additions in 2027, according to the report.
The region’s top five markets are Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, and Indonesia.

The Queensland government has approved funding for major water projects. The Australian state will offer $8 million (USD 5.4 million) over a period of two years for a detailed assessment of the water requirements for the hydrogen industry in the city of Gladstone.
South Korea‘s Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy launched a bidding process for hydrogen power generation on June 9. The selection of a winning bidder is scheduled for the middle of August. The government has planned two bidding rounds this year, with a total volume of 1,300 GWh, and the first round aims to allocate half of this volume. South Korea has described the initiative as “the world’s first hydrogen power generation bidding market.” In recent weeks, South Korea has engaged in energy collaboration discussions with several countries, including Azerbaijan, France, Japan, and Oman. Seoul is focusing on hydrogen production as it shifts away from nuclear power.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has released a report on Oman’s potential as a competitive low-emissions hydrogen supplier. It notes Oman’s solar and wind resources, as well as its expansive land area, as key factors. Oman aims to produce at least 1 million tons of renewable hydrogen per year by 2030, with targets of up to 3.75 million tons by 2040 and 8.5 million tons by 2050 – surpassing current hydrogen demand in Europe. “The 2040 hydrogen target would represent 80% of Oman’s current LNG exports in energy-equivalent terms, while achieving the 2050 target would almost double them,” said the IEA.
Mitsubishi Power Americas and Magnum Development have closed a $504.4 million loan guarantee from the US Department of Energy’s (DoE) Loan Programs Office to develop the world’s largest industrial green hydrogen facility in central Utah. Michael Ducker, the vice president for Mitsubishi Power Americas, said that the loan will create a path to accelerate the long-term hydrogen market across the United States.
Lhyfe and Capital Energy have signed a collaboration agreement to jointly develop offshore renewable hydrogen projects in Spain and Portugal. “Under the agreement, the two companies will work together to create hydrogen production sites at some of the offshore wind farm sites currently being developed by Capital Energy,” said Lhyfe. “The Spanish energy company already has a development pipeline of more than 7.5 gigawatts (GW) in both countries.”
Thyssenkrupp has announced plans to list Thyssenrupp nucera’s shares on the regulated market (Prime Standard) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The initial public offering of ThyssenKrupp nucera’s shares will likely be completed “before the summer break, subject to capital market conditions,” said the two companies.
