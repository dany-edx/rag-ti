WA Premier Roger Cook said the project, being developed alongside the initial 100 MW/200 MWh Kwinana battery energy storage system that commenced operations in May 2023, will play a significant role in the state’s transition to renewable energy and a more sustainable future.
“My government is doing what’s right by WA, investing in our state’s future to deliver a strong economy for generations to come,” he said.
“These large-scale batteries allow us to pump more renewable energy into the grid while keeping our system stable.”
The Kwinana Battery Stage Two project is expected to be completed and ready for operation in late 2024.
West Australian government-owned energy generator and retailer Synergy said the Kwinana stage two battery will allow for renewable load shifting, absorbing excess energy from rooftop solar when demand is low and discharging during peak periods, helping to provide long-term stability in the South West Interconnected System.
The battery technology for the Kwinana project has been supplied by Chinese company Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited, better known as CATL, while Spain’s Power Electronics has been contracted to supply the inverters.

Cook said the project is part of his government’s committed to WA’s clean energy goals with the state investing more than $3 billion (USD $2.01 billion) in renewable energy generation, transmission, and storage.
That investment includes supporting Synergy to expand its portfolio of battery energy storage assets to 3 GWh of storage capacity by the end of 2025.
Installation of the Kwinana batteries comes as Synergy gears up to begin works early this year in Collie on one of Australia’s biggest lithium-based batteries. Once built, the Collie big battery will provide 500 MW of power with 2 GWh of energy storage.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/12/forrest-promises-financing-for-14-gw-of-clean-energy-projects/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 12, 2024",Forrest promises financing for 14 GW of clean energy projects,"Australian mining magnate Andrew Forrest has committed to financing Squadron Energy’s 14 GW development pipeline of clean energy projects to support the Australian government in achieving its target of 82% renewable energy by 2030.
Squadron, part of the Forrest’s family’s private investment company Tattarang Group, said the 14 GW of new renewable power will power the equivalent of six million homes. The company also noted that there is a further 6 GW of renewables projects in Squadron’s development pipeline to follow.
Forrest, who is among the world’s loudest green hydrogen enthusiasts, said the commitment was huge from a major Australian company that is getting on with the job of building the renewable energy capacity required to deliver green power.
“The time for talk is over. We are investing right now in Australia’s green energy transition and creating jobs and economic development for regional Australia,” he said.
The announcement was welcomed by Australia Energy Minister Chris Bowen, who described the “ambitious” development pipeline as “proof renewable energy investors are getting on with the job, capitalising on Australia’s huge renewable potential, and helping transform our energy grid for the 21st century.”
Bowen recently announced an expanded Capacity Investment Scheme that is targeting 32 GW of renewable generation and storage capacity to support the nation’s clean energy transition.
“Firmed renewable energy and storage is not only the cheapest form of energy but provides crucial reliability as increasingly old and unreliable coal fired power stations inevitably exit the system,” he said.
Squadron’s commitment will come through a combination of wind, solar and battery energy storage projects.
The first project to be delivered will be the 414 MW Uungula wind farm near Wellington in central-west New South Wales (NSW) where a ceremony was held on Thursday to mark the start of construction of the $1 billion-plus project.

The project, which last month secured an underwriting contract from the state government in NSW’s latest round of auctions for new clean energy supply, is among those added to Squadron’s portfolio after its $4 billion purchase of CWP Renewables in 2022.
Others projects in Squadron’s near-term pipeline include the 700 MW Spicers Creek wind project west of Gulgong, also in central-west NSW, and the 400 MW Jeremiah wind farm near Gundagai in the state’s west.
It is also looking to install a 30MW battery at its 270 MW Sapphire wind farm near Glen Innes in the state’s north, where it also has approval for a 180 MW solar farm.
Squadron also announced it has signed a $2.75 billion agreement with GE Vernova to supply wind turbines for the Uungula, Spicers Creek and Jeremiah projects.
Jason Willoughby, Chief Executive Officer of Squadron, said the strategic alliance would strengthen the company’s rollout of renewable energy projects and “significantly reduce the risk on the supply chain for upcoming projects.”

Fonterra has finalised the deployment of a high-temperature heat pump in combination with a solar thermal plant at its Palmerston North production site where it produces fresh milk for New Zealand’s North Island.
The company, which is one of the largest dairy producers in the world, said the heat pump converts excess heat from chillers and compressors into a heat source.
“We’re really excited about this unique combination of a commercial heat pump and solar thermal plant helping us reduce our gas consumption and emissions output,” said Graham Thomson, site manager for Fonterra Palmerston North.
The new project is expected to reduce the natural gas required by the site and remove 495 tons of carbon emissions per year, equivalent to taking 140 cars off the road. It is Fonterra’s fourth site to upgrade its energy infrastructure within the last year, as the company works toward its Scope 1 and Scope 2 target of 50% emissions reduction by 2030.
The heat pump and solar thermal plant has secured co-funding from the Government Investment in Decarbonising Industry fund, delivered by New Zealand’s Energy Efficiency Conservation Authority.
In March 2023, Germany-based manufacturer MAN Energy Solutions said it was building an industrial-scale heat pump that generates steam without using gas for use at one of Fonterra’s farms.

The agency also highlighted “continued policy uncertainty” following early achievement of Australia’s Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET) among the reasons for it revising down the country’s forecast renewable energy additions for the 2023-28 forecast period.
“In Australia, a lack of new federal incentives and rising investment costs have delayed the development of new projects,” the IEA said in Renewables 2023, the latest edition of the France-headquartered agency’s annual market report on the sector.
“Notably, the distributed PV segment, which has been the primary source of growth in Australia in recent years, is forecast to experience a faster-than-anticipated decline in installations due to saturation of the power system and increasing grid integration challenges,” the IEA said, noting that governments will need to address the issues or risk falling well short of the tripling of renewable energy capacity by 2030 that was agreed to at the COP28 climate summit in December.
Australia is one of more than 100 countries that backed a pledge made at the summit in Dubai to triple the world’s renewable energy generation capacity by the end of the decade.
“Overcoming grid bottlenecks, streamlining lengthy permitting processes and enhancing system flexibility should be prioritised to accelerate deployment of renewables,” the IEA said, adding that even projects nearing completion in Australia can still be subject to delays with commissioning processes sometimes taking “a year or longer.”

Despite reining in Australia’s forecast growth, the IEA remains bullish on solar power as a whole, predicting that PV and wind will account for 95% of global renewable expansion over the 2023-28 period covered by the forecast.
The amount of renewable energy capacity added to energy systems around the world grew by 50% in 2023, reaching almost 510 GW, with PV accounting for three-quarters of additions worldwide.
IEA analysis shows that under existing policies and market conditions, global renewable power capacity is now expected to grow to 7,300 GW over the next five years. Solar PV and wind account for 95% of the expansion, with renewables overtaking coal to become the largest source of global electricity generation by early 2025.
The report also shows that prices for solar modules in 2023 declined by almost 50% year-on-year, with cost reductions and fast deployment set to continue with global manufacturing capacity forecast to reach 1,100 GW by the end of 2024, significantly exceeding demand.
While the outlook for solar is bright, the report provides a reality check on the momentum behind green hydrogen, assessing how many announced projects are likely to go ahead.
The IEA said that more than 360 GW of electrolyser projects with start dates before 2030 had been announced but only 3% of them had reached financial close or started construction.
The agency anticipates that of all the projects announced worldwide to use renewables to produce hydrogen this decade, only 7% of the proposed capacity is expected to come online by 2030.
“The forecast is also less optimistic for Asia-Pacific, mostly due to uncertainty in Australia over the future of stalled projects,” the IEA said. “One project’s environmental permit had lapsed before it reached financial close, and plans for projects in Bell Bay have been put on hold due to high water and transmission congestion.”
