The Fremantle Solar Farm was to be built on a 19.4-hectare landfill site majority owned by the City of Fremantle but Epuron has been unable to negotiate a power purchase agreement with an electricity retailer.
The developer, which had full approval to proceed with construction, recently suggested the City of Fremantle take on a different business partner for the project, but a council committee was this week asked to go even further and terminate the project.
In a submission to the council’s Finance, Policy, Operations and Legislation Committee, the Director of Strategic Planning and Projects said Epuron had earlier this year inquired about transferring the project to another commercial entity, “effectively indicating that Epuron no longer wished to proceed with the project”.
The report blamed “market conditions in the wholesale and retail electricity markets” for Epuron’s inability to secure an offtake agreement for the power that would be generated on the site, acknowledging it was a critical requirement for the project to proceed.
“Given that in over five years Epuron has not been able to bring the project to fruition, city officers are not confident that another party would be more successful in progressing the project and executing a lease in a timely manner,” the report reads.
“Therefore, officers consider it is now an appropriate time to terminate any further work by the city on trying to facilitate development of a solar farm at the South Fremantle landfill site.”
Epuron, recently acquired by Ark Energy, has developed more than 3 GW of wind and solar capacity around the country with about 1 GW of that now operating or under construction.
Among its developments are the 75 MW Clermont Solar Farm in Queensland, since sold to German-owned developer Wirsol, and the 105 MW Nevertire Solar Farm in north-west NSW, which was purchased by Elliott Green Power in 2018.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/14/elevated-shipping-costs-to-remain-challenge-for-solar-sector/,"COVID-19,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 14, 2022",Elevated shipping costs to remain challenge for solar sector,"New data supplied by Dutch multinational financial services company Rabobank shows that ocean container shipping costs have fallen from a record-breaking high in September 2021 but are still up to five times higher than in 2019 and the banking group has warned there is no return to pre-pandemic lows on the horizon.
Driven by Covid-19 related disruptions, international container freight rates have increased dramatically since January 2019, reaching a record price of nearly $US10,400 in September 2021. In June 2022, the global freight rate index stood at almost $US7,100.
The higher freight costs and supply chain disruptions are impacting all industries but solar PV is one of the most effected due to the high concentration of solar panel manufacturing in China. The elevated freight costs and shipping constraints are also impacting other system components like trackers, inverters and batteries.
In its Global Ocean Freight Outlook report, Rabobank says container freight prices are set to continue to gradually decline over the next 12 months from the “irrational” highs reached late last year but are not expected to return to pre-pandemic lows.
RaboResearch global supply chain analyst Viet Nguyen said shipping container prices were “never” expected to return to the low pre-pandemic rates of approximately $US3,000 a container, but predicted they would decline from the current $US7,000-$US78,000 per container mark in the year ahead.

Nguyen said several global “macro drivers” are influencing shipping dynamics and behind the lingering high costs.
While heightened inflation and all-time low global consumer confidence levels are exerting downward pressure on ocean rates, Nguyen said rates are being supported at higher levels by imbalanced global trade flows which hinder a cost-effective repositioning of empty containers.
“Added to this, geographical uncertainties are adding risks and there are also growing operational costs for the sector from higher energy costs and sustainability regulations,” he said.
While shipping rates are forecast to soften, Rabobank expects schedule reliability for containers to also recover, albeit slowly. Port congestion, a major contributor to the continuing supply disruptions, is forecast to remain at key ports until the first half of next year.
For Australia, where the solar sector is heavily reliant on ocean container shipping for modules, the “overall picture is a rather positive one”, according to RaboResearch general manager for Australia and New Zealand Stefan Vogel.
“While we are not expecting ocean freight to return to normal for the sector here before 2024, we think it is going to get better for us in Australia, and many other parts of the world, but it is not going to happen tomorrow,” he said.
“It will be one or two years of ocean container freight rates tending to move slowly lower, while simultaneously reliability will improve, step by step, up to something closer to normal.”
Vogel said the “bad news” is that it is unlikely ocean container freight rates will return to the levels experienced before the pandemic, where “they had been extremely cheap”. However further extreme price rises to, or above, the Q4 2021 highs are also not expected.
“The overall picture is a rather positive one, where we do not expect to see those rates explode suddenly again or that there will be another massive disruption in the chain,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/14/electric-vehicles-pass-remote-road-test-say-anu-researchers/,"EV,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 14, 2022",Electric vehicles pass remote road test say ANU researchers,"Sales of electric vehicles (EVs) have surged globally in the past few years but motorists in Australia have been slower to respond, many identifying ‘range anxiety’ — or the fear of not being able to reach the next charging point – as one of the major barriers to large-scale adoption of all-electric cars.
That concern has now been allayed with researchers from the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra saying a new study has demonstrated that EVs have the potential to tackle the long distances needed to travel to necessary services in Australia’s regional and remote areas.
The study, published in the Australian Geographer, assessed the feasibility of using EVs in remote Australia. The researchers analysed travel distances between communities and service hub towns – towns with populations of at least 1,000 that Australians living in remote areas travel to for services – utilising the current fleet of EVs and existing charging technologies.
Report co-author and research leader at ANU’s Battery Storage and Grid Integration Program Dr Bjorn Sturmberg said the study shows that more than 99% of people living in regional Australia would be able to travel to their nearest small service hub town with existing long-range EVs. For short-range vehicles, the study found 93% of regional residents would be able to make a one-way trip to the nearest service hub without having to stop to charge.

“Our results demonstrate that the utility of electric vehicles in remote communities is perhaps more feasible than might at first be expected,” Sturmberg said. “This suggests that while the barriers to the electrification of transport in remote communities are significant, they are not insurmountable and are deserving of consideration in national and state policy developments in the deployment of charging infrastructure.”
Australia has seen solid growth in EV sales over the past year with the latest data from the Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) showing there were 20,655 EVs sold in Australia last year, up by 6,900 from 2020. New EVs accounted for 2% of all new car sales in 2021, up from 0.78% in 2020.
Yet the adoption of EVs in Australia remains slow by international standards, and what policies do exist tend to focus on incentivising uptake among urban residents, potentially leaving remote communities in the “too-hard basket”.
Strumberg said EVs offer numerous advantages for those living in remote areas, including lower maintenance requirements and independence from costly, dangerous and polluting petroleum imports.
“We need to do better, electric vehicles shouldn’t be left in the too-hard basket,” Sturmberg said. “It’s an unequitable and unfair path forward if remote and regional communities are the last ones left driving diesel vehicles, especially as they will be some of the most impacted by catastrophic climate change.
“Yes the barriers are obvious – large distances, unsealed roads – but the benefits are equally obvious. It’s difficult and expensive to get diesel out to these communities, and electric engines are simpler and more robust than fuel engines.”

Report co-author Dr Francis Markham said the results are encouraging but conceded some aspects need further investigation.
“For example, we still don’t have clear data on the impact of unsealed roads or different conditions on the effective range of electric vehicles,” he said. “And information on the performance of electric vehicles in very hot conditions is still lacking. However, we are confident that electric vehicles do have a place in regional and remote Australia.”
While acknowledging there are still areas to be investigated, Sturmberg said the jump in Australia’s emissions driven by transport demonstrates the need for stronger policies to accelerate Australia’s clean transport transition.
The Industry Department’s quarterly national greenhouse gas inventory released last month shows that Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions rose by 0.8% – 4.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide – in 2021, largely attributed to transport and reliance on fossil fuels. Transport accounted for 18.6% of emissions, up 4% on the previous year. Since 1990, transport emissions are up 48.1%.
“The transport sector is responsible for 25% of global emissions and more than 18% of Australia’s greenhouse gas pollution,” Sturmberg said.
“It must rapidly decarbonise, and electric vehicles are going to be a crucial part of that decarbonisation.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/14/labors-renewable-target-much-more-ambitious-than-it-seems-best-bang-for-buck-policy-needed/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,OCEANIA",,"JULY 14, 2022",Labor’s renewable target much more ambitious than it seems – best bang-for-buck policy needed,"This follows Labor’s pre-election commitment to cut Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions by 43% below 2005 levels by the end of the decade, while boosting renewable electricity production to 82% of our electricity supply.
These goals are entwined. To cut emissions, we have to rapidly switch to renewables. That’s because the largest and cheapest emissions reductions are found by shifting electricity production to renewable sources. Since winning office, the Labor government has left no doubt about its commitment to these goals.
While the Greens have called for more rapid action, the goal to get to 82% renewables is much bigger than it seems. For the first time in a decade, the federal government is well out ahead of the states. Making this a reality, however, means tackling key missing parts of the clean energy shift: storage and grid modernisation. To galvanise change, my colleagues and I propose setting targets (and supporting policy) for storage as well as ramping up the renewable energy target.

The government’s target isn’t plucked from thin air. It comes from the future scenario that Australia’s energy market operator, AEMO, said was deemed most likely by experts and stakeholders among all scenarios modelled in its 2022 Integrated System Plan.
If this 82% target is achieved, it really will be a step change. This target is four-fifths bigger than the targets of any of the coal-dependent eastern states, home to most of our population.
Victoria and Queensland are aiming for 50% renewables by 2030, while the New South Wales electricity roadmap is also consistent with a target of around 50%. Getting an extra 32% of renewables beyond this is ambitious, but entirely possible.
Tasmania hit 100% renewables last year and South Australia is well on its way to 100% renewables. But these successes are partly offset by the fossil fuel dependence of Western Australia, the Northern Territory and smaller grids elsewhere.
To reach 82% nationally, this means we will require roughly the same proportion of renewable electricity in the three big coal states. While the coal states are making progress, the federal government clearly wants them to go much faster.
How can we get there? Modelling by the market operator shows we need to build 45 gigawatts more wind and solar generation, plus 15GW of storage by the end of the decade. That will cost an estimated $115 billion for renewable energy and storage. Victoria and NSW in particular envisage private capital driving this investment.
In Australia, we have had policies encouraging renewable energy for 22 years. That’s given us about 32GW of renewable generation, of which about two-thirds is solar on the roofs of homes and businesses. Over this period, just 1GW of storage has been added – all of it from chemical batteries.
In short, this means we are set for a great acceleration. To achieve the 82% target means building renewables around five times faster than we have over the past two decades, and building storage at about ten times the rate of the past five years.
Undertaking this massive transformation so quickly will require serious policy support. To that end, we’ve proposed a Renewable Electricity Storage Target, to accelerate the storage build.
We believe this would work, as it is based on the highly successful Renewable Energy Targets supported by successive federal Labor governments, and it can be developed and implemented quickly.
To supercharge the renewable expansion will also require policy support. We don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Greatly expanding the Renewable Energy Target is one proven way to do this.
Producing the power is useless if we can’t transmit it. Modernising our grid is crucial too. Here, too, all three coal states are making good headway in innovative arrangements to improve transmission and grid access.
Image: Energy Source & Distribution
There’s no obvious financing issue for transmission. The challenges here are about connection, regulatory approval and community support. The Albanese government can help by letting a thousand flowers bloom rather than constraining developments through centrally imposed uniformity.
Before the election, Labor promised to cut household power bills by $275 per year by 2025. Wholesale electricity prices climbed to stratospheric highs before the May election, and have stayed there ever since. Unless these prices drop – and it is increasingly uncertain they will – households will be facing huge retail electricity price increases.
This is likely to pose serious problems for many low-income households. The federal government will be pressured to do something about it. But this, too, will be hard, given there are much tougher budgets flagged.
Does this mean the 82% target is unattainable? No, but arcane debates on market design must play second fiddle to decisive storage and renewable electricity policy. And the government will have to plan very carefully how it directs public money to achieve its goals – while helping the states to put out menacing energy price spot fires as well.

Enel Green Power (EGP), a unit of Italian energy giant Enel, has revealed that it will partner with Australia-based Vulcan Energy Resources to consider lithium extraction at a site in Cesano Romano, in the Latium region of central Italy.
The site is located 20 km north of Rome and is 50%-owned by EGP and Vulcan Energy Italy, the Italian subsidiary of the Australian lithium company. They secured a research permit from the local authorities earlier this year.
“The collaboration involves a phased approach, which in a first scoping study phase will consist of assessing the potential of Vulcan’s ‘Cesano’ license, a site that covers an area of 11.5 square kilometres, just a few kilometres away from Rome,” Enel said. “The partners intend to examine the prospects for further developments in geothermal lithium, starting from the area under exam but not excluding further collaborations in Italy and abroad.”
Vulcan Energy said the site hosts a single geothermal well that yields two “hot brine” samples containing high average lithium-in-brine.
“Vulcan’s in-house geological team in Germany will be collaborating with Italian geologists and local stakeholders to collate and assess historical data, verify the lithium content and assess the brine for potential lithium project development,” the company said. “If successful, the Cesano project could provide a source of strategic, sustainable lithium in Italy for Europe’s battery and automotive market, and become a possible future additive to Vulcan’s zero-carbon lithium business.”
In Germany, Vulcan Energy is working on scaling up its zero-carbon lithium project, which aims to produce geothermal energy and battery- grade lithium hydroxide by pumping geothermal brine from deep in the earth at a site in the Upper Rhine Valley. Once the heated brine has been used to produce energy, it will be processed into high-purity lithium hydroxide monohydrate at another facility.
The company has demonstrated the production of LHM exceeding minimum quality specifications for the battery industry. And in June, it secured a site outside of Frankfurt, Germany, for its planned commercial processing facility. It said it hopes to begin large-scale production at some point in 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/14/theres-big-money-in-recycling-materials-from-solar-panels/,"MARKETS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 14, 2022",There’s big money in recycling materials from solar panels,"From pv magazine USA
The question about what to do with solar panels at the end of their useful life is about to become moot as Rystad Energy analysis shows the incredible value of materials that can be extracted in the recycling process. Rystad estimates that recyclable materials from PV panels at the end of their lifespan will be worth more than AU$4 billion (US$2.7 billion) in 2030, up from only AU$250 million (US$170 million) this year, and the value will approach AU$118 billion (US$80 billion) by 2050.
PV recycling is still in early stages, but it has been successfully implemented in Europe where the Waste Electrical and Electroni Equipment (WEEE) directive requires 85% collection and 80% recycling of the materials used in solar panels. In the US, California-based Solarcycle recently raised AU$9.7 million (US$6.6 million) in growth funding to advance its solar recycling platform. Investors include some solar veterans such as SolarCity founders Peter and Lyndon Rive, and former CEO/CTO of Sunpower, Tom Dinwoodie.
Rystad projects that solar PV waste will grow to 27 million tonnes per annum by 2040, and they estimate that recovered materials from retired panels could make up 6% of solar investments by 2040, compared to only 0.08% today.
Not only is material recovery expected to be big business, but reclaiming the minerals will become increasingly necessary as the growing demand creates a short supply.
“Rising energy costs, improved recycling technology, and government regulations may pave the way for a market where more defunct solar panels are sent to recycling rather than the nearest landfill. Recycling PV panels can help operators save costs, overcome supply chain woes and increase the likelihood of countries meeting their solar capacity goals,” says Rystad Energy analyst Kristin
Based on the rate of installations in 2022 and assuming a 15-year lifespan for solar panels, Rystad looked at which regions and countries will benefit most from solar recycling in 2037. The findings showed that China will account for 40% of global installations this year, and when these panels mature in 15 years, the estimated recycling value will be AU$5.6 billion( US$3.8 billion), out of a AU$14 billion (US$9.6 billion) global total. India will trail in second place with an estimated US$800 million in value, followed by Japan with US$200 million in estimated value. North America in 2037 is projected to be worth US$1.5 billion, with Europe set to hold US$1.4 billion.
The components in a solar panel with the highest value are aluminium, silver, copper and polysilicon. Silver accounts for about 0.05% of the total weight but makes up 14% of the material value, Rystad estimates. To recycle polysilicon requires an energy intensive process, which is why recycled polysilicon has a high price. Glass is not on the list of high value components because, while there’s a lot of it on solar panels, it has a low resale value.
Rystad estimates peak solar energy implementation in 2035 of 1.4 TW, by which time the recycling industry should be able to supply 8% of the polysilicon, 11% of the aluminium, 2% of the copper, and 21% of the silver needed by recycling solar panels installed in 2020 to meet the material demand. The result will be increased ROI for the solar industry, an enhanced supply chain for materials, as well as a reduction in the need for carbon intensive mining and refinery processes.
In September 2021, NREL scientists published research that describes how to motivate the market first to reuse solar panels, and then recycle them by guiding national industrial policy to create a financially viable end-of-life solar panel industry. The researchers’ projections showed that 40% of all solar panels could be reused and recycled using subsidies equal to AU$26 (US$18) per panel for 12 years. The Rystad analysts point to the EU’s regulatory mechanisms for jumpstarting the recycling industry in Europe. And while policy can be a promote an industry, the economic potential of the solar recycling industry may be the greatest motivator.
