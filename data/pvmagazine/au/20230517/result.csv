https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/17/why-reform-to-australias-transmission-regulations-is-urgent/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",,"MAY 17, 2023",Why reform to Australia’s transmission regulations is urgent,"During a CEDA Rewiring the Nation speech, AEMO CEO, Daniel Westerman, said that “regional and rural communities are being asked to shoulder the burden of construction and hosting transmission, while the benefits are shared with populations hundreds of kilometres away, even interstate.” “What we must do is to put the processes and resources in place to hear and understand communities’ concerns, and come up with a better way to work together and benefit together,” Westerman added. “Because in this energy transition, people matter most.
So how do we put people first and put the processes and resources in place?
When considering the scale of transmission development that is being proposed over the next decade (and I won’t comment on the realistic need), many actors in the energy sector (including Minister Bowen) believe the RIT–T process is not fit-for-purpose. Here’s a couple of quotes from this article and from an article on Renew Economy in March 2022.
“Until now, the economic pros and cons were the key driver of the RIT-T process – not the social benefits, or risks,” Bowen said.
“A cost benefit analysis which does not take appropriate account of the views of local communities is not a fit-for-purpose process for communities or for TNSPs,” Bowen said.
“To me, the situation in Western Victoria has confirmed my inclination that the RIT-T process is no longer fit for purpose, especially when you consider the massive scale of transmission upgrades we have to complete over the next decade,” Bowen said.
From these words, it’s clear that the current failed regulatory environment, not community opposition, is delaying the investment in transmission. The Australian public have every right to object to something that is broken and demand it be fixed, especially when it is impacting them and the regions in which they live. If not urgently addressed, these delays will not only slow the investment in Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) generation, impacting Australia’s capacity to achieve net zero emissions, delays will also likely result in higher than necessary electricity prices to consumers and less reliable supply outcomes than would otherwise be the case under more robust framework.
Acknowledging that the regulatory environment is not fit-for-purpose is one thing. Proceeding with existing projects developed under this not ‘fit-for-purpose’ framework is absurd. Talking around this topic will not hide the significant cracks that have appeared, will not bridge the vast chasm between planners and the people, and will not prevent the long-term consequences of not setting the framework and institutional arrangements right from the start. How can trust ever be built when the very thing that supports transmission planning lacks credibility and legitimacy? As communities have strongly indicated, no amount of financial incentive will compensate for planning oversights, lack of action, or complacency.
We have the perfect opportunity, in this once in a lifetime transition, to develop new framework and institutional arrangements that are better suited to a future decentralised system and to reset the process on new and existing transmission projects. There is an urgent need for regulatory reform to support best practice planning and better facilitate acquisition of social licence. Not only for TNSPs but for all industry participants.
Yes, the reform required will take time, that some may argue we do not have, but you must ask; what is the consequence of inaction on this much needed reform? Why has so much time already been wasted? Why are recent rule change requests, that seek to improve community outcomes, not being applied to all transmission projects, including those that are still in the early stages of development? These questions are particularly relevant given Minister Bowen first announced his intention to overhaul the framework 14 months ago and minor changes may not take effect until November 2023.
To help fast-track the transition, rather than forging ahead with a ‘new push for “unglamorous” transmission’, the energy market should apply ‘lessons learnt’ from the past three years of significant community and industry angst, prioritising society, and the planet, to develop equitable laws, rules, policy, and framework that considers the triple-bottom-line and ensures least-impact transmission pathways are developed.
When you consider the ‘business as usual’ alternative, which is what we are still dealing with today, the cost of inaction on regulatory reform is likely to lead to increased opposition to overhead transmission and REZ developments across the nation. The industry is also likely to dispense of any opportunity to acquire social licence, resulting in further material project delays that will adversely impact the industry, economy, consumers, investors and above all, our legislated climate change objectives.
Instead of trying to patch the current framework, maybe it’s better to abandon it completely and for each state to develop its own (or adopt a new national standard) more robust and defensible framework that better supports people, businesses, the environment, climate policy and investment objectives. 
The Victorian government has departed from the RIT-T by developing the Victorian Transmission Investment Framework (VTIF). This new framework introduces a much needed strategic and proactive process to ensure timely co-ordination of investment in transmission, generation, and storage infrastructure across Victoria’s REZs, tailored to Victoria’s energy needs. It also seeks to better integrate land use considerations, environmental impacts, and community views into the planning process. This new framework should be applied to all transmission projects that are being delivered under the current RIT-T framework, noting the Victorian Government and the VTIF consultation paper also indicate the RIT-T is not fit-for-purpose.
Instead of fast-tracking of new transmission links, regulators, law makers, government and AEMO should be fast-tracking the reform that is necessary for a smoother, more robust, and defensible transition. This is the role of all policymakers.
We have seen a decade of inaction on this, and the Australian public should not be paying the price.

Compounding this is the fact some camps are arguing new transmission is the only way out of this absurd situation, meanwhile Australia’s framework for assessing transmission projects is being deemed unfit for purpose.
Curtailment of renewable projects has jumped almost 40% in the past year, Daniel Westerman, CEO of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) told a forum in Sydney on May 15.  The most impacted states are Victoria and New South Wales (NSW), though the woes extend into parts of Queensland.
 “From our control room we can see that increasing amounts of solar and wind generation are being curtailed because there’s not enough transmission capacity to transport it,” Westerman said.
“From January to March, the links from Victoria to NSW and Tasmania were at their limits for 42% and 57% of the time respectively. And during those hours when the sun is producing free electrons, the links were binding for two-thirds of the time to NSW, and over 80% of the time to Tasmania.”
“In other words, parts of our energy highway are at gridlock,” he added.
While Westerman lamented the rate of renewable curtailment, Ian Learmonth, CEO of Australia’s green bank, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), warned Australia is well below where it needs to be to reach its climate targets. That is, 43% emissions reduction and over 80% renewable generation in our grid by 2030.
“In order to meet these very ambitious goals around renewable energy and emissions, we need to install an estimated 29 GW of large-scale renewables,” Learmonth said. “That’s about 3.6 GW a year or 300 megawatts a month. That’s a substantial wind farm a month.”
“To give you an understanding of the uplift required, last year in terms of large-scale wind and solar we only installed 2.3 GW and something like 2.7 GW of solar rooftop, so we are still well behind the pace.”
While Australia has finally reached a level of political unity on the energy transition, cracks in the nation’s regulatory systems are rearing their heads. Front of mind is the regulatory investment test for transmission or RIT-T process, which is used to assess transmission projects. Sitting beside Westerman and Learmonth, federal energy minister Chris Bowen declared this framework “no longer fit for purpose,” at Monday’s event.

Specifically, he pointed to the process by which transmission projects in the country are approved, and the need for this framework to consider social and environmental impacts, rather than simply economics. 
“Last month I submitted rule changes to the Australian Energy Market Commission to commence this reform process, with a fast-tracked process set to see the changes in effect from November this year,” Bowen told the forum.
“The rule changes seek to improve community outcomes and ensure the timely and efficient delivery of major transmission projects.” 
Darren Edwards, Director of Energy Grid Alliance, says the process does indeed need urgent reform, but this overhaul has been on Bowen’s agenda for over a year, and the changes slated for November are “minor.”
The tensions between governments eager to accelerate projects to meet their climate goals, transmission and network operators executing projects, and the local communities where they are proposed, have grown considerably in the last year and put the country in a delicate position.
“When it comes to transmission, social licence is the most important issue we have to face,” Bowen continued on Monday. “A near-total rebuild of the grid comes with challenges, particularly for the communities where projects will be built.”
“It would be easy, but wrong, to dismiss those concerns as just NIMBY-ism. In my experience, most concerned community members are not anti-renewables, anti-transmission or anti-progress. Nor, in most cases, are they opposed to the projects going ahead if their concerns are addressed.”
“A cost benefit analysis which does not take appropriate account of the views of local communities is not a fit-for-purpose process for communities or for TNSPs [transmission network service providers],” Bowen said.
Also speaking at the CEDA forum on Monday was Daniel Westerman, head of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). In his speech, he emphasised the need for new transmission in Australia – saying that while these projects weren’t “glamorous,” they are urgently needed since the curtailment of renewable generation is at record highs, up almost 40% from one year ago.
Bruce Mountain, director the the Victoria Energy Policy Centre at Victoria University, has questioned AEMO’s vision of a highly interconnected Australia-wide grid, saying that while of course some new transmission is required, the figures from AEMO are fundamentally overblown. Mountain argues storage within the states is often a preferable solution.
Despite Bowen’s concerns about the transmission approval framework, he has offered vocal support for AEMO’s contentious interconnector between Victoria and New South Wales Interconnector, known as the VNI West project.

AEMO is currently preparing its project assessment report in which it will identify its preferred route for the VNI West. This is the last stage in the regulatory investment test for transmission or RIT-T process which Bowen deemed no longer fit for purpose.
“To me, the situation in Western Victoria has confirmed my inclination that the RIT-T process is no longer fit for purpose, especially when you consider the massive scale of transmission upgrades we have to complete over the next decade,” Bowen said.

In short, the Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) says Ausgrid’s tariffs would see electric vehicle drivers in those regions charged significantly more than in the neighbouring jurisdictions, which are covered by the distributed network service providers (DNSPs) Essential Energy and Endeavour Energy. Specifically, it says some charging stations in the Ausgrid network would be between 400% to 650% dearer than their regional counterparts.

“The key difference between Ausgrid and the other DNSPs is the volumetric usage level below which a business customer can opt out of kVA/kW (demand/capacity) based charges,” the Electric Vehicle Council’s submission to the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) says.
“Essential and Endeavour have an established position of 160 MWh/annum as the threshold, which is consistent with most jurisdictions around the country. Ausgrid’s existing position is 40 MWh/annum, which they propose to lift to 100 MWh/annum via a series of steps through the 2024-2029 period.”
“The challenge from the perspective of the EVC is that at the 100 MWh/annum tipping point where a business customer will be required to transition from EA225 to EA302, the network cost component of a 500 kVA charging location in the Ausgrid region will be approximately $70k/annum (the energy costs being a relatively small component of the total network charges), while in the Endeavour region the network cost for the same type of site at 100 MWh would be approximately $9k/annum, and in the Essential region the network cost would be approximately $14k/annum,” the Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) writes.
Assuming these costs are recovered from electric vehicle drivers, it would equate to prices at popular, high-powered charging stations being approximately 50c/kWh more expensive in the Ausgrid network than in other parts of the state, the Council says.
“It’s the equivalent of adding about $10 per 100km to the cost of fuel for drivers in the Ausgrid area at these chargers, over and above the costs that will be present in other DNSP areas, putting electricity at public DC charging stations at this level of utilisation at a significantly higher cost than petrol for traditional cars.”
This added cost could be averaged out by charging network operators, but the outcome nevertheless leaves EV drivers inside the Ausgrid network worse off, the EV Council says.
In its submission, the Council calls on the AER to revise Ausgrid’s tariff structure, which it previously deemed meets its expectations. Countering this decision, the Council argues Ausgrid’s approach is at odds with the Regulator’s strategic objective of supporting the energy transition.  
While electric vehicles are definitely becoming more of a focus for policy makers and industry stakeholders, Australia is still well behind the curve – as demonstrated by the federal government’s recent National Electric Vehicle Strategy.

The electrolysers are based on a breakthrough made by Professor Swiegers and his team at the University of Wollongong on the New South Wales south coast, and are currently being commercialised by spinoff Hysata, where Swiegers is the Chief Technology Officer. Professor Swiegers and his team found that by using capillary-fed electrolysis, they could boost the electrolysis system’s overall efficiency from the 75% average to a total efficiency of 95%.

Hysata is now in the processing of manufacturing its high-efficiency electrolysers.
“It is estimated that green hydrogen will provide 15 to 20% of global energy demand in 2050, worth $2.5 trillion. We believe this new technology can help Australia capture a large share of that market,” Professor Swiegers said.
The technology was developed at UOW’s Intelligent Polymer Research Institute and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science.

Vietnam’s Ministry of Energy has released its National Power Development Plan VIII for the 2021-30 period, which is designed to improve the country’s energy security. The government plans to allocate USD 135 billion ($200 billion) by deploying more power generation capacity and new grid capacity, including projects to connect the country’s network with neighbouring countries.
The government has announced plans to create conditions for deploying rooftop PV systems in at least half of the country’s commercial and residential buildings through net metering, while stating that no further feed-in tariffs will be awarded in the future.
The plan also envisions Vietnam becoming an energy exporter by 2030, with electricity exports ranging from 5 GW to 10 GW. The government expects renewable energy to account for over 70% of the energy mix by 2050.
Vietnam has installed over 18.4 GW of PV capacity, primarily through a feed-in tariff scheme that supported small-scale and utility-scale installations. However, the government has not introduced an auction scheme since the expiration of the previous one. Instead, it has initiated a pilot scheme to facilitate bilateral power purchase agreements (PPAs) and open up the electricity market.
Under current regulations, the state-owned energy company Electricity Vietnam (EVN) monopolises the transmission, distribution, wholesale, and retail of electricity, serving as the sole buyer in the market.
The National Power Development Plan VII has revised solar targets for the period up to 2045, aiming for 13.6 GW of utility-scale solar and 3.4 GW of rooftop solar. To compensate for the reduced solar generation, the plan incorporates the expansion of offshore and onshore wind energy, as well as the import of electricity from Laos.
