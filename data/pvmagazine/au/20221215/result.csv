Publicly owned electricity company Stanwell is part of an international consortium seeking to develop the CQ-H2 project at Aldoga, about 20 kilometres northwest of Gladstone, with the view to producing up to 800 tonnes of green hydrogen per day for export to Japan and use in local industry.
Stanwell is developing the project in conjunction with Iwatani and fellow Japanese companies Kansai Electric Power Corporation, Marubeni, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and Sydney-based energy infrastructure business APA Group.
Stanwell Chief Executive Officer Michael O’Rourke said the company and its partners had recently completed a detailed feasibility study which proved the project is technically feasible and commercially viable “with appropriate government support in the initial phases”, and are now working together to lock in final arrangements to progress the project to FEED.
“The FEED study, which is subject to final approval by consortium members, will provide the detail required to support a final investment decision,” he said.
“With high-calibre expertise across the supply chain including potential off-takers, the project is on track for first hydrogen production in 2027.”

O’Rourke said the CQ-H2 project, which has signed an agreement to source renewable energy from Spanish renewable energy company Acciona Energia’s proposed 600 MWp Aldoga Solar Farm, will ultimately scale up to more than 3 GW of electrolysis capacity by the early 2030s.
It is anticipated the facility will produce up to 36,500 tonnes per annum of renewable hydrogen from 2027, scaling up to approximately 292,500 tonnes per annum to meet forecast demand.
Queensland Treasurer Cameron Dick said Stanwell’s partnership with major global energy heavyweights to build the CQ-H2 project could unlock billions of dollars of investment and thousands of good jobs for Queenslanders.
“The CQ-H2 project’s benefits for Queensland could be immense, with jobs in construction, manufacturing, and local service industries,” he said.
“The project could deliver over $17 billion in exports and $12 billion to Queensland’s gross domestic product over 30 years and create up to 8,900 good jobs at its peak.”
Dick said the state government has committed $15 million towards funding Stanwell’s FEED costs, including future planning for supply chain and workforce opportunities.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/15/anu-launches-heat-maps-tool-to-maximise-australias-renewables-potential/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 15, 2022",ANU launches heat maps tool to maximise Australia’s renewables potential,"With Australia’s energy system rapidly transitioning from a dependency on coal-fired power generation towards a future built on renewables, researchers from the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra have developed a “heat map” that shows the best sites that could be used for new wind or solar farms.
The high-resolution heat maps use geographic information to identify the solar and wind potential of all prospective areas close to existing or planned high-voltage transmission lines, a consideration which the researchers said is much more useful than local wind and solar data alone.
Professor Andrew Blakers, from the ANU College of Engineering, Computing and Cybernetics, said access to transmission lines is the largest constraint currently for developers of renewable energy generation projects.
“Typical power lines cross dozens to hundreds of properties and require complex negotiations with many people. In contrast, solar and wind farms generally fit on one or a few properties. That usually makes an access agreement much easier to negotiate,” he said.
“All of the possible sites we’ve identified are near existing and approved high-power transmission lines.”
Each local government area in Australia has been divided into different cost categories for solar and wind generation, ranging from the strongly preferred Class A to less preferred Class E.

Blakers said the maps show the relative cost of renewable energy on each 1,000m x 1,000m parcel of land for solar farms and 250m x 250m parcel for wind.  The most suitable locations are highlighted in red and less preferred sites are outlined in pink or blue, while unsuitable areas, including urban areas, protected areas and native forests have been excluded from the study and are shown in green.
Users can zoom and pan across the maps, clicking on a pixel to obtain an indicative relative cost of generating solar or wind electricity (in A$/MWh) for that location. It includes the cost of energy from a solar or wind farm plus the cost of a low-voltage powerline to the nearest existing or planned high-voltage transmission lines. The tool does not include costs for environmental and geotechnical approvals, substations, etc.
Blakers said the area between Goulburn and Lithgow in New South Wales is especially suitable for new clean energy projects because it is well serviced by transmission lines and has good wind and solar resources.
“In Victoria, the Yallourn district is attractive because of good wind potential and strong existing transmission into Melbourne, plus there’s a need to replace local coal industry jobs. There’s also extensive wind potential west of Melbourne,” he said.

“South Australia has excellent wind and solar potential to the east of the St Vincent and Spencer gulfs, while Queensland’s best wind and solar sites follow the coastal transmission lines north from Brisbane in areas such as Rockhampton and Mackay. Perth, on the other hand, has an abundance of suitable solar and wind sites close to transmission lines that run from the north and the south of the city.”
Tasmania has extensive wind resources along the north coast, and on King and Flinders islands and in Bass Strait, but the researchers said their development depends on the Marinus Link being constructed across Bass Strait.
ANU PhD researcher Cheng Cheng said it is hoped the heat maps project will help accelerate the development of renewable energy projects by empowering farmers, communities and local councils when negotiating with developers.
“If landowners or local councils are able to access this sort of information and collectively approach developers themselves, it could speed up the development process,” he said. “This can also assist the solar and wind farm developers by reducing the complexity and time required to gain legal access and community acceptance.”

The round attracted the support of the venture arm of global oil and gas giant bp and was co-led by existing investors United States-based energy major AES Corporation and Sydney-headquartered investment management firm Artesian Venture Capital.
Sydney-based 5B said the capital raise will support the development of its redeployable, modular, prefabricated Maverick solar system, a PV array in which modules come preassembled onto concrete blocks that replace conventional mounting structures.
5B co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Chris McGrath said the backing from bp is “a powerful validation” of the company’s technology and would allow it to fast track its international expansion strategy, which includes plans to establish a manufacturing and assembly hub in North America.
“Collaborating with bp ventures and the broader bp businesses offers us a wealth of global commercial and operational expertise,” he said. “It presents a great opportunity to deploy our 5B Maverick technology across a range of global markets.”
The company’s Maverick system is a ground-mounted solar array of up to 90 PV panels mounted on specially designed frames that can be unfolded and installed at speed. The modules are oriented in a concertina shape at a 10-degree tilt and electrically configured, allowing for rapid installation. Earlier this year, the company set a new speed record for solar deployment with 1.1 MW deployed in a single day by a crew of 10 people at AES’ Andes Solar II B solar farm in Chile’s Atacama Desert.

5B said it has more than 60 MW of its Maverick solution deployed across more than 100 sites and is planning to ramp up the roll out of its technology.
The company has already signed agreements with the developers of several major projects, including the massive 20 GW Australia-Asia PowerLink being developed by Sun Cable in the Northern Territory, but the association with bp is expected to provide even more opportunities.
Bp Ventures Principal Johnathan Stone, who will join the 5B board of directors, said the investment arm will now work with 5B to explore the best opportunities to collaborate on the deployment of the Maverick technology on future bp and clean energy joint venture Lightsource bp projects.
“5B’s innovative solar technology can deliver low-cost power generation at speed, helping to meet rising electricity demand,” Stone said.
“This deal is a fantastic example of bp investing in a business that will support our renewable energy transition growth engine. And is another strand of our multi-energy vector country strategy that will support the decarbonisation of energy in Australia.”
Lightsource bp, which is half-owned by UK-based solar developer Lightsource Renewable Energy, announced in 2021 that it plans to reach 25 GW of solar project capacity by 2025 and has nominated Australia as one of its key markets.
Lightsource bp already has five projects in operation or under construction across New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria.

Solar, wind and other renewable energy sources are expected to continue building momentum, with installed capacity set to grow by about 2,400 GW through 2027, according to the IEA.
It said that renewable energy will account for 90% of all planned capacity expansions throughout the world, dominated by solar and wind. Cumulative solar PV capacity will almost triple under the IEA forecast, growing by nearly 1,500 GW and surpassing natural gas by 2026 and coal by 2027.
“Renewables were already expanding quickly, but the global energy crisis has kicked them into an extraordinary new phase of even faster growth,” said Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA.
Within five years, global renewables capacity could represent an amount equal to the total installed power capacity of China, said the IEA. The growth projections are 30% more than was expected last year.
IEA said low prices and security are two major drivers for the global adoption of renewable energy.
“First, high fossil fuel and electricity prices resulting from the global energy crisis have made renewable power technologies much more economically attractive, and second, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused fossil fuel importers, especially in Europe, to increasingly value the energy security benefits of renewable energy,” it said.
Birol claimed that the current energy crisis could be a “historic turning point” on the path to a clear, safer energy system.
“Renewables’ continued acceleration is critical to help keep the door open to limiting global warming to 1.5 C,” he said. Limiting global warming to this level will be key to staving off the worst effects of climate change.
Solar will account for more than 60% of all forecasted renewable capacity expansion, setting records for annual additions every year through 2027. Although module prices have increased, utility-scale PV is the least costly option for new electricity generation in most countries throughout the world.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/15/hydrophobic-nanocoating-to-reduce-soiling-in-solar-panels/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EGYPT",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 15, 2022",Hydrophobic nanocoating to reduce soiling in solar panels,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists at Al-Azhar University in Egypt have developed a hydrophobic nanocoating with  a self-cleaning effect that can reportedly increase the efficiency of solar panels by up to 30.7%.
“The main contribution of this work is to enhance the performance of PV solar panels by reducing the dust accumulation on the panels’ surfaces over time, thereby reducing cost, effort, and water consumption while cleaning,” the researchers said “Enhance the performance of photovoltaic solar panels by a self-cleaning and hydrophobic nanocoating,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports.
The researchers used a coating solution based on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and silicon dioxide (SiO2) nanocomposites mixed with ethanol and isopropanol. They dissolved this mixture by using an ultrasonic washer and they then applied it to the solar panels by spray coating. By using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the research group determined that the nanocoating increases the surface roughness at the nano and micro scale, which in turn increases the hydrophobicity and contact angle.
“The metal oxide nanoparticles are well dispersed in the PDMS polymer,” the scientists explained. “Through the hydrophobic chain of PDMS, PDMS-SiO2 nanoparticles cross-link with one another, which further leads to the formation of clusters of different sizes and then the micro-nanostructure.”
By using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (UV–Vis), the academics also verified that the coating’s average transmittance is 91% in the visible light range. They said that it is resistant to ultraviolet radiation. They applied the solution to a 100 W panel and compared its performance to that of a 100 W reference panel without coating and a 100 W panel with a commercial anti-soiling nanocoating. After 40 days of exposure to the environmental conditions in Cairo, the academics found that the hydrophobicity and self-cleaning properties of the PDMS-SiO2 nanocoating made it possible to remove the dust by water droplets by 74%, which compares to just 52% for the reference panel.
They also found that the nanocoated panel’s efficiency was up to 30.7% higher than that of the reference panel.
“The nanocoated panel has greater output power, greater efficiency, and the lowest temperature and dust accumulation density,” they concluded. “Because of the hydrophobic and self-cleaning properties of the nanocoated panel, the water droplets rolled off and removed a large amount of dust from the panel surface.
The researchers did not provide details about the costs of the nanocoating, nor did they say whether commercial production is being considered at this stage.
