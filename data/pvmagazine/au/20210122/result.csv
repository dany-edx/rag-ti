https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/22/wa-continues-push-to-become-green-hydrogen-superpower/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 22, 2021",WA continues push to become green hydrogen superpower,"The State Government announced on Friday it will pump $2 million from its Renewable Hydrogen Fund (RHF) into the Yuri Green Ammonia Project, a large-scale renewable hydrogen and ammonia development on the Burrup Peninsula in the state’s northwest.
The project partners will initially install a 10 MW solar farm and electrolyser to transition Yara’s existing ammonia plant’s dependence on natural gas to renewable hydrogen. The plans also cater for a significant expansion up to 500 MW in coming years with the solar energy used to produce renewable hydrogen, which will in turn be used to produce green ammonia for export to global markets.
WA’s Minister for Regional Development Alannah MacTiernan said the project would put the Pilbara “front-and-centre in the global renewable hydrogen race, creating a clean ammonia product for the world”.
“Western Australia has an extraordinary opportunity to become a leader in the emerging renewable hydrogen industry,” she said.
“With Yara’s Pilbara site alone accounting for 5% of the world’s ammonia production, this project offers a unique opportunity for WA to demonstrate the potential of green hydrogen at an industrial scale.”
The funding is part of the WA Government’s $28 million commitment to establishing the state on the world stage as a significant producer, exporter and user of renewable hydrogen.
The strategy has already reaped major rewards with the Pilbara home to the recently approved 26 GW Asian Renewable Energy Hub which, among other ventures, aims to produce green hydrogen for export to Asian markets.

Other green hydrogen for export projects in WA include the 5 GW Murchison Renewable Hydrogen Project near Kalbarri, and Infinite Blue Energy’s $350 million Arrowsmith Hydrogen Plant. 
The Yuri project is the fourth capital works grant to be allocated in the first round of the RHF, subject to conditions including the project reaching a final investment decision.
The project is one of four in WA currently being considered for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) $70 million Renewable Hydrogen Deployment Fund grants program.
In another boost for the state’s renewable energy credentials, the government announced this week it had received 65 expressions of interest to produce an potentially huge 1.5 GW renewable hydrogen hub at the greenfields Oakajee Strategic Industrial Area north of Geraldton.
EOIs were submitted from Australia, Japan, Korea, India, Germany, Spain, the UK, France and the United States with at least 10 of the respondents classed as “super majors”, each having a global reach and market capitalisations in the $10s or $100s of billions.
“The strong response … confirmed what we already knew about the strong global appetite for renewable hydrogen, and the enormous potential of the Mid-West region,” MacTiernan said.
“Global economies are hungry for clean, renewable energy, and we have the perfect mix of wind and solar potential that is the envy of the world right here in WA.”
Located just north of Geraldton, the Oakajee SIA is recognised for its world-class wind and solar energy potential. Initial assessments show the site could provide up to 1,250 MW of solar and 270 MW of wind-generated renewable energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/22/surprise-loss-of-420-mw-of-rooftop-pv-in-south-australia-shows-forecasting-key-for-future/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 22, 2021",Surprise loss of ~420 MW of rooftop PV in South Australia shows forecasting key for future,"At about 10.30am on January 13, a cloud band that was thicker than predicted moved across metro Adelaide, causing solar production, both rooftop and large scale, to unexpectedly fall rapidly – in the order of ~420 MW in less than 30 minutes.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) said grid demand had picked up to supply load previously supplied by rooftop PV and 90 minutes later the cloud passed, resulting in a ramp up of solar generation of ~840MW over 90 minutes.
James Luffman, CEO of solar data services company Solcast, said the unexpected drop in rooftop PV production and resultant ramp in grid demand, and associated price spike, highlighted the importance of accurate forecasting tools as increasing levels of weather-dependent generation are integrated into the grid.
“With the right forecasting in place, you go from a fairly serious event to something quite minor,” Luffman said.
“Without the right forecasting, integrating more renewables into the grid becomes much harder and more expensive.”

Energy market analyst Paul McArdle, managing director of Global Roam, said the sudden drop in rooftop PV and unexpected ramp in grid demand, which climbed by 45% to 1,506 MW in the 10.30am trading period, triggered a spike in the trading price from $20.92 to $200.48. Included in the 10am and 10.30am trading periods were spikes in the 10am and 10.05am dispatch intervals to $1,015.13 MWh.
AEMO said the ‘price spike’ was a normal market response to ensure generation was available to meet the increased demand and that normal operational reserves were available to ensure there was no adverse impact on frequency or system security.
The energy market operator said while the initial ramp was unexpected, its forecasting systems had rapidly adjusted for the change in demand but there remain concerns that existing forecast models leave gaps in the predictions, which can affect the security and reliability of electricity supply.

Luffman said the rapid increase in rooftop PV generation in the National Energy Market (NEM) brings with it some new technical challenges with “lesser and lesser weather events significant to the power system”.
Luffman said the rapid increase in rooftop PV generation in the National Energy Market (NEM) brings with it some new technical challenges with “lesser” weather events having a increasingly significant effect on the grid.
“We need more forecasting technology,” he said.
“Weather forecast models are a key input to demand forecasts. These models have improved a lot over the past few decades, and they do pick up the larger events like this cloud band pretty well, however they have a fundamental problem that they don’t get the intensity or timing right.
“That’s understandable, since these models basically work off their previous forecasts, plus new observations – but these observations are taken the night before because the models take hours to run and disseminate.
“In this specific case, the weather models got the event and its timing OK, but they missed the intensity – how thick the clouds would be at the peak of the event.”
Solcast, with support from AEMO and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), is working to develop a forecasting tool which will track and predict renewable output in South Australia in real time. Solcast’s forecasting tool is designed to predict up to six hours ahead in five-minute increments, distributed into 1-2km grids across SA.
“We weren’t really surprised by this,” Luffman said of the January 13 incident. “Firstly in the sense that it was a well-forecast event, at least from our system, and secondly in the sense that there is so much rooftop PV now that lesser and lesser weather events are significant to the power system.”
ARENA which last year provided Solcast with $994,685 in funding, said the Gridded Renewables Nowcasting Demonstration project will deliver more frequently updated, high-resolution weather forecasts specifically designed for the Australian energy industry.
“What our system does is to watch the clouds on the day as they develop, which may be different to what the weather models were expecting, and run lighter, faster and less traditional models for the next four hours every five or 10 minutes,” Luffman said.
“This gives huge accuracy improvements for the zero to four-hour ahead period, for example in our solar forecasts at two hours ahead we typically see the error drop to about one-third to one-half the error of the weather models.”
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said Solcast’s project, by improving accuracy of forecasts could help solar and wind farms, networks as well as the grid overall.
“Renewable generation forecasts, particularly in the intraday time-frame, are critical for effective management of the electricity system with growing shares of large-scale variable renewable energy, energy storage, distributed energy resources and emerging demand management capability which are at the front and centre of innovation in the energy industry,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/22/world-first-for-gold-coast-as-new-ev-fast-charger-unveiled/,"EV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 22, 2021",World first for Gold Coast as new EV fast charger unveiled,"Queensland-based EV charging technology developer Tritium has installed the first of its RTM75 75KW DC fast chargers, catering for EV drivers in Australia’s tourism capital.
Developed in the company’s Brisbane headquarters, the RTM75 charger is 50% faster than existing 50 kW EV chargers, delivering 75km of range to an EV in 10 minutes of charging. The charger allows for simultaneous charging of two vehicles at once and, measuring 1998mm x 850mm x 309mm, is built with urban, retail, fleet and public environments in mind.
The RTM75 is the first charger introduced to the market featuring Tritium’s Modular Scalable Charging (MSC) hardware platform which enables the charger to be scaled up to 350 kW in increments of 25 kW as demand increases. The modular platform does away with the need to replace old platforms to install faster charging units as EV uptake accelerates.
“This has been something the industry and our customers have asked for over the years, and we are the first company in the world to deliver it,” Tritium CEO Jane Hunter said.
“With our MSC platform … chargers can quickly be upgraded to 75kW, 100kW, and beyond, without a rip-and-replace required.”
In a statement, Tritium said the RTM75 supports all charging standards on the market, including CCS and CHAdeMO, and satisfies the needs of all batteries up to 920V. The RTM75 is equipped with Plug and Charge (ISO 15118) technology, eliminating the need for credit card payments or RFID authentication at the charger.
The liquid-cooled RTM75 is also the first to deliver Whisper Mode quiet charging, while the sealed unit protects the electronics from dust, water, salt and other contaminants, reducing the need for maintenance.
Tritium founder and chief growth officer Dr David Finn said the RTM75 provides the flexibility, capital efficiency and scalability customers want.
“The electrification of transportation is at tipping point, so our customers want to know how they can easily extend their charging site capacity over the coming years. They want no regrets and capital efficient scaling of their charging sites.
“Tritium’s MSC hardware platform allows our customers to scale their charging sites for half the price and configure their charging sites for a desired reliability.”
The charger installed in the Gold Coast suburb of Broadbeach on Tuesday is the first in a network of 10 chargers which will be rolled out across the city in the coming weeks. Charging stations will be installed at locations from Pimpama on the northern edge of the city to Coolangatta in the south to provide EV drivers with the necessary infrastructure as well as catering to anticipated demand.
The installation comes at a time of heightened interest in EVs in Australia with the sale of EVs and the installation of chargers on the rise in Australia over the last couple of years.
Electric cars still however only make up 0.6% of new vehicle sales in the country, lagging well behind many other developed nations, and one of the reasons the adoption of EVs has been so low in Australia is a lack of a reliable charging network.
Queensland’s Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the Gold Coast fast-charger network will anchor the Queensland Electric Super Highway of 31 fast-charging sites enabling travel from Coolangatta to Cairns and from Brisbane west to Toowoomba in a low or zero emissions EV.
Gold Coast mayor Tom Tate said the EV chargers would help showcase the city as an innovative destination, committed to a greener future.
Tate said the power used to charge vehicles at the new charging stations will be offset by power generated by the city’s Virtual Power Plant, which harnesses solar PV energy from more than 47 city buildings.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/22/inverter-manufacturer-doubles-warranty-for-australian-market/,"INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 22, 2021",Inverter manufacturer doubles warranty for Australian market,"Chinese-headquartered GoodWe has increased its warranty to a standard 10 years across its full range of on-grid inverters, when registered on the company’s Smart Energy Management System (SEMS) portal. The warranty will apply to all inverters produced after October 1, 2020 and installed in Australia after January 1, 2021.
GoodWe Australia country manager Dean Williamson told pv magazine the decision to increase the warranty was a simple one after the company’s inverters were thoroughly tested by a third party over an extended period. 
“We’ve done extensive testing and we’re very confident with extending the warranty,” he said. 
“It was predominantly the third party. They gave us the stamp of approval that all of our string inverters were manufactured to last longer than 10 years. 
“We hope this new warranty will give customers more confidence to choose our world-leading technology products and that it shows our strong desire to stay in the Australian market for the long haul.” 
To be eligible for the new 10-year warranty, customers must be connected to GoodWe’s SEMS portal and have uploaded the inverter’s power generation data.  
Williamson said the company’s SEMS enabled end users to track their power generation data daily and allowed for their inverters to be upgraded remotely. The system is also designed to diagnose issues and send warning push notifications and troubleshooting guidelines automatically.  
An established presence in the Australian market since 2012, GoodWe continues to prove one of the most popular PV inverter manufacturers, offering a series of single- and three-phase inverters ranging from 0.7 kW to 250 kW for use on residential and commercial rooftops and in energy storage systems. 
Williamson said GoodWe had delivered more than 300 MW of inverters into the Australian market in 2020 with about 60,000 units sold. 
GoodWe’s single-phase 3-5 kW DNS series and the 5-10kW MS series have led the way in the residential rooftop solar PV market while the three-phase SMT and MT series, with an impressive 98.8% maximum efficiency, have been successful in the commercial sector. The SMT series is offered in 25-36 kW versions while the MT series range in size from 50-80 kW. 
With a determination to increase its presence in the commercial sector, Goodwe plans to bolster its range of inverters in early 2021 with the inclusion of the larger HT series.  
“We’ve already had some really positive results in the commercial sector with our SMT and MT series but we’ve had a lot of people request we bring out a 100 kW inverter,” Williamson said. 
“We’ve had a lot of anticipation about the HT series and we’ll be adding it in the next couple of months.” 
With a power ranging from 100kW to 136kW, the new HT series inverters will be suitable for large commercial and utility-scale projects. The company’s data sheet states the inverters have up to 12 maximum power point trackers (MPPTs) and are compatible with bifacial modules. They feature power line communication, string level monitoring and incorporated IV-Curve diagnosis for intelligent detection of voltage and current issues.

Scientists from Southern Cross University in Australia are trying to understand the extent to which the use of magnetic fields, light energy fields, ultrasonic fields, or pulsating electric fields could help to improve the efficiency of water electrolysis in solar-powered hydrogen generation plants.
“This study has taken a closer look at these applied fields due to the potential that their efficacy can be further enhanced by considering the molecular dynamics of water molecules,” the researchers said in “Increasing the efficiency of hydrogen production from solar powered water electrolysis,” which was recently published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. “This study also advocates the use of accurate and effective test equipment to help develop a universal approach which would allow future research to be easily evaluated.”
Green hydrogen is currently more expensive the blue hydrogen, and the efficiency of commercially available solar-hydrogen hybrid systems ranges from a minimum of around 2.3% to a maximum of approximately 12%. This low efficiency is generally attributed to efficiency losses in PV generation and the electrolysis cell, power consumption by electronic controls, temperature moderation and ineffective coupling systems between the solar panels and the electrolyser.
One way to increase the efficiency of solar-powered electrolysis, regardless of the effectiveness of coupling, is to improve the efficiency of electrolysis through the four proposed approaches, which are already known to assist in reducing the formation and flow of oxygen and hydrogen gas bubbles in electrolysers.
“The main issue reported with bubble evolution is the gas bubbles sticking to the electrodes which causes the bubbles to build-up between the electrodes, resulting in an increase in the ohmic resistance within the electrolyser,” the Australian group explained, adding that more power consumption is needed to compensate for this resistance.
Magnetic fields
Magnetic fields are produced by electric currents that can be either macroscopic currents in wires or microscopic currents associated with electrons in atomic orbits. These fields are a well-known solution for enabling the desorption of hydrogen from the electrodes and the resulting reduction of the bubble size of the produced gases. Although different explanations have been given for the increased flow rate of hydrogen out of the system, when these fields are applied, the scientists believe that these contradictory findings are possibly the result of different electrolyser designs.
“Such a difference in design would result in a different interaction between the externally induced magnetic field, the electrodes and the electric field generated within the electrolysis chamber,” they said.
However, the current issues with this approach are the difficulty of using bar magnets in large-scale applications, and the high cost of producing rare earth magnets and generating a magnetic field from an energy source. More research is needed to assess the true efficiency of this approach in improving electrolysis, the researchers said.
Light energy
Green lasers have already been used at the research level to enhance hydrogen generation through light energy, which creates an induced electric field. The lasers have proven to be efficient enough to provide considerable enhancements in the production of the fuel, but the costs of the energy needed to power them may still be too prohibitive to make this technology viable.
Instead, focused sunlight does not need any additional input energy and might represent an interesting alternative.
“The utilisation of sunlight energy to enhance hydrogen production in solar-hydrogen hybrid setups would complement such a system if setups incorporated sunlight receivers into photovoltaic panels to induce sunlight into the electrolysis chamber,” the academics said, adding that the real potential benefits of the application of light energy must be thoroughly investigated.
Ultrasonic fields
Ultrasonic fields have been applied with success in improving the efficiency of electrolysers, showing potential for a 20% increase.
“For example, higher ultrasonic power inputs in some electrolyte concentrations caused gas bubbles to break up into smaller bubbles, resulting in greater bubble adhesion to the electrodes, higher system impedance and an increase in energy consumption,” the researchers said.
However, the energy needed to create the fields is less than the power saved due to the increased efficiency, which currently makes their application to hydrogen unviable. Furthermore, several researchers have shown that the efficiency of the electrolyser is not always proportional to ultrasonic power input.
“For example, higher ultrasonic power inputs in some electrolyte concentrations caused gas bubbles to break up into smaller bubbles, resulting in greater bubble adhesion to the electrodes, higher system impedance and an increase in energy consumption,” the scientists said, noting that only a few studies have investigated this and other issues related to this external field.
Pulsating electric fields
Pulsating the applied electric field at different intensities and frequencies is another way to improve hydrogen generation. Different theories were outlined to explain why this technique effectively produces an increase in electrolysis efficiency, although no conclusive findings were established.
“As with all applied fields, a disadvantage of applying a pulsating electric field is the cost of system required to generate the pulsating electric field, especially for high frequency electric fields with high power requirements,” the academics explained. “The cost of such equipment also rapidly increases as the power requirements of the equipment increases to meet the needs of scaled-up systems for industrial applications.”
They said that the application has yet to be comprehensively studied. More work is needed to assess the effects of pulsating the applied electric field for water electrolysis.
Water molecule
A look at how these four applied fields interact with molecular movement and the redistribution of molecules in the water during electrolysis could bring us closer to proving their viability, the researcher claimed. In particular, they have looked at the ortho-para conversion of water molecules to understand the movement and reactivity of water.
“Ortho H2O is a term for water molecules that have a spin state due to the energetic moment of each of the hydrogen elements working in conjunction with each other,” they explained. “While para H2O is a term for water molecules that have no spin state due to the energetic moments of the each of the hydrogen elements working in opposite directions.”
The scientists concluded that a deeper understanding of the molecular dynamics of water in electrolysis will be crucial to bringing the proposed four approaches closer to viability.

WA’s Mid-West region has some of the world’s best solar and wind resources, which could feed the development of WA’s green hydrogen economy.
This week the McGowan Government has revealed that it has received 65 expressions of interest to produce and export renewable hydrogen at the greenfields Oakajee SIA, more than half of coming from international companies. 
Oakajee SIA is located north of Geraldton in WA’s Mid-West region and early assessments of its renewable resources suggest its world-class wind and solar energy potential could provide up to 270 MW of wind and 1.25 GW of solar. To put this in context, the Professor of Future Energy Systems at TU Delft in the Netherlands, Ad van Wijk, estimates that it takes 25 GW of solar to generate 1 million tonnes of hydrogen annually. The WA Government believes that with support from gas firming, it could generate electricity from Oakajee SIA at below $0.10 per kWh. 
“The strong response to the Oakajee EOI process confirmed what we already knew about the strong global appetite for renewable hydrogen, and the enormous potential of the Mid-West region,” said WA Regional Development Minister Alannah MacTiernan. 
According to a WA Government statement, EOIs came from Australia, Japan, Korea, India, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, France and the United States. 16% of these submissions expressed a desire to develop and finance an entire green hydrogen export supply chain. Others expressed interest in supplying particular sections of a supply chain such as technology, utilities, manufacturing, finance, etc. 
The WA Government said that at least 10 of the submissions came from ‘super majors’, which is to say, companies with global reach and market capitalisation capabilities in the $10s or $100s of billions. Unfortunately, this rules out Blockbuster Video. 
“Global economies are hungry for clean, renewable energy, and we have the perfect mix of wind and solar potential that is the envy of the world right here in WA,” continued MacTiernan. “We look forward to working with the companies that expressed interest in this opportunity to bring the production of renewable hydrogen to Western Australia.” 
The EOIs will now be considered by the Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation with the Mid West Development Commission, Mid West Ports Authority, and DevelopmentWA.
As part of the state’s Recovery Plan the WA Government brought forward its Renewable Hydrogen Strategy targets a decade (from 2040 to 2030) and topped up its green hydrogen fund. The state is now pumping $28 million into the development of WA’s renewable hydrogen sector.

In one of his first official acts, President Joe Biden signed executive orders January 20 to rejoin the United States into the Paris climate agreement and block construction of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline.
The Oval Office event was Biden’s first major action to tackle global warming as he brings the largest team of climate change experts ever into the White House. During his presidential campaign, Biden had laid out plans to roll back a number of the Trump administration’s environmental and energy policies.
Former President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, a non binding global accord to address the threat of climate change, in 2017. Trump argued the U.S. commitments were unfair, unnecessary, and costly.
Absent action on the federal level, a coalition of state governors and local leaders worked to support the international deal’s goals.
Following Biden’s executive order, clean energy groups applauded the United States’ planned return to the Paris Agreement and said they’re looking forward to working with the new administration to combat climate change.
Gregory Wetstone, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy, commended Biden’s “commitment to move America beyond climate denial on his very first day in office.”
Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the industry “stands ready to help America meet its commitments in the Paris Agreement.”
President Biden also signed an executive order revoking the existing presidential permit for the Keystone XL pipeline.
The cross-border oil pipeline project between Canada and the United States has faced strong opposition from environmental and Indigenous groups for years. Former president Barack Obama rejected the project. In 2017, however, Trump issued a presidential permit to help move the stalled project forward, citing energy independence and job creation.
In a statement, Keystone XL developer TC Energy Corp. called Biden’s plan to scrap the permit “very disappointing.” The Canadian company claimed the decision could lead to thousands of job losses, adding that the firm is assessing its options and suspending the project.
In the lead-up to Biden’s inauguration, TC Energy announced plans to make the Keystone project the “first pipeline to be fully powered by renewable energy.” As part of the initiative, the company said its commitment would spur up to $1.7 billion in investment and create 1.6 GW of renewables.
According to a Reuters report, Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently signalled his continued support for the Keystone pipeline, telling reporters, “Our government is making sure that Canada’s views are heard and considered.”
Environmental groups have praised Biden.
Catherine Collentine, associate director of the Sierra Club’s Dirty Fuels Campaign, called the Keystone Xl rejection “a huge and hard-fought victory for our communities, clean water, and climate.”
Mitchell Bernard, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Biden’s “swift and decisive” actions on the pipeline and Paris Agreement make “the United States once more part of the global climate solution—not the problem.”
The White House climate team is led by Gina McCarthy, former administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The new climate team includes the following:
