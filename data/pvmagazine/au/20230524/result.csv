The company concluded that before 2050, over USD 1.9 trillion ($2.89 trillion) will need to be invested for the country to reach its targets, 95% of which will flow towards clean energy technologies and supportive infrastructure.

In the Net Zero Scenario, Australia’s wind and solar installations would reach 300 GW by 2050, more than a seven-fold increase from the 39 GW installed by 2022. Solar will be the main generator, BNEF says, accounting for 201 GW alone, which the company says would be split between rooftop and utility-scale projects (much in the way it is today).
In this scenario, investment in Australia’s generation fleet would need to be more than $413 billion by 2050, with 57% expected to flow into wind and solar assets. Interestingly, it found $11 billion needs to be spent yearly on Australia’s grid – a far higher figure than the current spend.

This scenario is where the numbers become truly mind-boggling, with BNEF concluding the investment required rockets to $739 billion by 2050 on this path.
This is because becoming a hydrogen exporter would require Australia’s electricity generation to grow to 1,963 TWh by 2050, seven times more than today. “This electricity demand would be 169% more than in the Net Zero Scenario,” BNEF says. 
“To supply this demand on a least-cost basis, wind and solar capacity across the country would need to grow to 812 GW by 2050, 21 times more than today.”
If Australia could realise this, it would be capable of supplying 6%, or 28 million metric tonnes per year, of the expected global low-carbon hydrogen demand in 2050.
“Hydrogen will play a pivotal role in Australia’s own decarbonisation ambitions as well as green export ambitions,” BNEF Australia Energy Transition Analyst, Sahaj Sood, said. “However, a lack of concrete clean hydrogen import demand together with significant transportation challenges stand in the way of Australia’s hydrogen export ambitions.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/24/six-act-companies-awarded-grants-from-innovation-fund-to-commercialise-promising-tech/,"FINANCE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 24, 2023",Six ACT companies awarded grants from innovation fund to commercialise promising tech,"The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) government has announced the winners from the third round of its $12 million Renewable Energy Innovation Fund (REIF). In total, it awarded $1,234,451 to six local companies.
The grants provide early-stage funding to businesses operating in the ACT that are seeking to commercialise technologies and projects capable of helping the country realise its targets.
The six funded companies include:
This Canberra-based startup has developed a 3D printer capable of printing highly complex and functional electronics like photovoltaics, batteries, sensors and more, and promises to do so in ways that are faster, cheaper and use less energy.
“We call it a printer for electronics but really its a multi-material additive manufacturing technology. You can literally make anything you want,” Ben Wilkinson, Syenta’s head of research and development, told pv magazine Australia last year. At that time, the company was preparing for feedback on initial printer design, which can be used to build electronic prototypes, before raising additional capital to realise the next steps of commercialisation.
The company is a spinoff from research conducted at the Australian National University (ANU). In 2022, the startup changed its name from Spark3D to Syenta.
Unlike the other winners, PV Lab is not a new startup and has been operating a commercial solar testing lab in Canberra for some years now.
It received funding for its project which seeks to reduce the number of solar panels going to landfill by addressing causes of panel degradation and barriers to reuse.  The project will look at the cause, scale and solutions to panels breaking down in high-humidity climates. It will also consider solutions for reusing panels through refurbishment, monitoring and assessing viability.

Today many of Australia’s secondhand panels are exported to Africa to be resold. Since most of Australia’s current solar waste is not from systems reaching their end of life, but rather households upgrading, many used panels function well and can be repurposed. The issue that Australia’s resale industry doesn’t seem to be regulated at all. Pv magazine Australia has heard from a number of people within the industry that the primary process for assessing panels prior to export is visual assessments – that is, people simply look at them.
PV Lab was also awarded a $220,000 grant through the ACT’s Innovation Fund in 2020 to expand its solar testing in Canberra.
Startup HYREA has developed a novel approach to producing green hydrogen, which it says can be performed on-site and on-demand. According to the company’s website, the process, like electrolysis, extracts hydrogen from water and other suitable liquids. “Using the latest technology, we create a reaction between water and certain solid input materials – which we are calling Solid Hydrogen Cells (SHC),” the company says.
“Specifically, we generate a substitution reaction between water and the material – a by-product of this reaction is a controlled release of pure hydrogen.”
“The input material, or SHC, plays a double role in the process: as a chemical agent that extracts hydrogen from water through substitution reactions and as a compact chemical storage allowing us to effectively deliver hydrogen,” HYREA says.
Using the ACT government funding, HYREA intends to develop a proof-of-concept hydrogen fuel-cell electric boat with on-board hydrogen production facilities.
Zeppelin Bend has been awarded the funding to develop its ‘Community Energy Opportunity Toolkit’. The project aims to build a web based tool to identify, prioritise, and analyse network constraints which can be used to select ideal locations for community batteries. 
This will hopefully enable locations for high-value distribution network-connected battery projects to be mapped. Once identified, these locations maximise the value available to battery projects.
Flex-G is seeking to extend the lifespan of batteries through enhanced thermal management.
One of the leading causes of primary degradation in batteries is insufficient thermal control, ACT government says. To combat this, Flex-G will adapt its nano-coolant technology to limit thermal shocks in batteries.
Aqacia has developed a proof-of-concept for applying machine learning, or AI, to perform quality control of solar panels using image recognition and classification. The technology is on the cusp of commercial readiness, the ACT government says. 
The company’s PV 4.0 project will take this proof-of-concept into commercial trials which will see machine learning tools deployed into workflows currently relying on human assessment. 
“The project will then serve as a demonstration to export this ACT-created solution globally,” the ACT government says.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/24/australia-and-india-establish-hydrogen-taskforce-deepen-renewable-ties/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EVENTS,FINANCE,HYDROGEN,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,INDIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 24, 2023","Australia and India establish hydrogen taskforce, deepen renewable ties","Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese and Indian leader Narendra Modi have met in Sydney to discuss bilateral trade and cooperation in new energy sectors, among other matters.
The pair have agreed to establish an Australia-India Green Hydrogen Taskforce, though details remain scarce. The announcement outlines that the two prime ministers have agreed to the Taskforce’s terms of reference, though precisely what these terms are has not yet been made public. 
Prime minister Albanese did, however, say: “the Taskforce will comprise Australian and Indian experts in renewable hydrogen and report to the Australian-Indian Ministerial Energy Dialogue on the opportunities which are there for Australia and India to cooperate in this important area of renewable hydrogen.”
The Taskforce builds on a proposal first made in March at the Australia-India Annual Leaders’ Summit.

The prime ministers have also “identified concrete areas for cooperation and in renewable energy sector,” Indian prime minister Modi said. “We had constructive discussions on strengthening our strategic cooperation in the sectors of mining and critical minerals,” he added.
The South Asia director of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), Vibhuti Garg, recently outlined how India and Australia can help one another realise their clean energy ambitions by providing supply chain alternatives.
Australia brings to the table critical minerals for battery and renewable equipment, as well as technology, while India could offer solar module and equipment manufacturing, Garg outlines. Both Australia and India are heavily reliant on China for these vital components of the energy transition.
Additionally, Garg says India is already investing heavily in green hydrogen projects locally, and are looking at Australia to set up manufacturing units. India’s government is aiming for the country to produce around five million metric tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2030 under its National Hydrogen Mission.

One of the key offtakers for the hydrogen is expected to be India’s growing steel industry, which the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts could double by 2030 and quadruple by 2050. Australia is the globe’s leading iron ore producer, but does relatively little steel manufacturing – although numerous experts have noted this as the most obvious application for our green hydrogen ambitions. 
A recent report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) estimated that for Australia to meet its hydrogen superpower vision, it would need to grow solar and wind capacity to 812 GW by 2050 – a 21 fold increase on today’s levels. Excitement around Australia’s hydrogen potential appears to have weaned somewhat recently, especially following the US’ renewable energy manufacturing policy, the Inflation Reduction Act.
While momentum around hydrogen slows, it has grown around the critical minerals sector, where interest in seeing Australia not just exporting raw critical materials, but also refining and processing them, is growing rapidly. With a number of lithium and rare earth processing projects either recently opened or currently in development, the country is seeking to capture much more of the value chain from critical minerals deposits.

This slots in nicely with the plans of many of Australia’s political allies, since the globe is currently heavily reliant on China’s processed minerals and materials. For India, which is seeking to massively grow its solar manufacturing sector in the coming years, an alternate materials supply chain is welcome. 
A study by the IEEFA and JMK Research found Indian solar module manufacturing capacity could reach 110 GW per annum by 2026. “India will achieve self-sufficiency in solar PV modules at this level and expand exports further,” Garg said.
Australia could also potentially provide India with technologies and expertise in the exploration, mining and processing of critical minerals in light of India’s newly discovered lithium deposits, Garg added.
Australia and India are seeking to establish a comprehensive trade deal, building on the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement between the two countries signed last year. Both prime ministers today iterated their hopes such an agreement could be reached by the end of this year.
“The Australia-India relationship is already strong, but we both see potential for growth and an opportunity shape a better future for our region,” Albanese’s media statement read.
“In my first year as Prime Minister, I have met with Prime Minister Modi six times, which underscores the value we place on deepening ties between our nations,” Albanese added.

The company has announced its partnership with BIPV specialists Umax Energy to this end. The partnership will see Umax become the “master distributors” of GoodWe’s BIPV products in Australia, while also providing technical support services including system design, onsite installation guidance, project management, and maintenance.
Goodwe released the details of its first BIPV product for Australia, the lightweight Galaxy panel, in May. 
The new 335 W slim panel, designed for low load-bearing rooftops, received easily the most interest of all Goodwe’s new products on display at the Sydney convention, Williamson and Wright said. The Galaxy is frameless and 60% lighter than conventional modules, the company says.

Goodwe will also bring an integrated solar roof tile to Australia, Williamson and Wright told pv magazine. The solar tile, targeting the residential segment, will be one of only two such products offered in Australia, the pair said. 
In October 2022, Melbourne-based renewable energy company Leeson Group unveiled its Australian-engineered rooftop solar tile with an efficiency of up to 19.3%.
BIPV products have tended to be more successful overseas, in places like Europe where buildings are older and require specialist approaches. But with the traditional rooftop solar proposition seemingly approaching saturation in Australia, companies are now looking to fill the more niche gaps in the market.
With the new BIPV division, it appears Goodwe is taking the popular ‘full stack’ strategy even further. Within the last few months, the company also launched its high voltage residential battery, as well as a battery system for commercial and industrial applications, which can be scaled to store between 101 kWh and 450 kWh.

Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) plans to develop the $30 billion (USD 19.95 billion) Evergreen project, a green hydrogen production hub in South Australia’s Eyre Peninsula. The project aims to install 14 GW of solar and wind capacity alongside 7 GW of electrolysis capacity. CIP expressed its confidence in the Australian market and its intention to generate more than 30 GW of renewable energy in the country. The Danish company said it is already invested in Australia’s first offshore wind farm, Star of the South, and the 5,000 MW Murchison green hydrogen.
APA Group has successfully conducted pressurised hydrogen testing in a 43-km gas pipeline in Western Australia. The government of Western Australia stated that the testing, carried out by APA, the owner and operator of the Parmelia Gas Pipeline, demonstrated the technical feasibility, safety, and efficiency of running the pipeline with pure or blended hydrogen at the current operating pressure. This development brings the pipeline closer to becoming one of Australia’s first gas transmission pipelines to be converted to a pure hydrogen service. The project’s next phase will focus on preparing the pipeline for hydrogen service, including detailed conversion plans, safety studies, and exploration of potential supply and offtake opportunities.
Infinite Green Energy and Samsung C&T have signed an agreement to develop and construct the Arrowsmith Hydrogen Plant in Western Australia. The plant, powered by wind and solar energy, will be located 30 km south of Dongara and is expected to produce up to 300 tonnes of green hydrogen per day (100,000 tonnes per year). The initial focus of production will be on Asian markets, including Japan and South Korea. Infinite Green Energy said it anticipates starting production in early 2028.
University of Alberta researchers have developed a catalyst that, with a small amount of power, can produce hydrogen and clean drinking water when placed in any type of water. The catalyst was discovered by chance during an experiment and is non-toxic, abundant, and cost-effective. The team said it aims to create off-grid devices to support remote communities and disaster relief efforts.
SK Ecoplant, a division of South Korea’s second-largest chaebol, has agreed to participate in Project Nujio’qonik, a green hydrogen commercialisation project in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Led by World Energy, the project aims to generate 1 GW of wind power, install 600 MW of electrolysis cells, and construct a green ammonia production facility. SK Ecoplant will be responsible for installing solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC) and handling the engineering, procurement, and construction of the green ammonia plant, in which they have a 20% stake.
Nel said it plans to build a new automated gigawatt electrolyser manufacturing facility in Michigan. “We are thrilled to bring home up to $400 million in investment from Nel Hydrogen,” said Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Nel has concluded that Michigan is the best option in terms of financial incentives, access to a highly skilled workforce, and cooperation with universities, research institutions, and strategic partners. 
Generate Capital has invested in Ambient Fuels, a developer that builds green hydrogen projects for the decarbonisation of heavy industries and transportation. The agreement includes a commitment to fund up to $250 million of green hydrogen infrastructure. “Our collaboration with Generate Capital supercharges our ability to meet the unique needs of our customers,” said Jacob Susman, chief executive officer of Ambient Fuels.
