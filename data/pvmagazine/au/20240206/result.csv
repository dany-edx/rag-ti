A new study has tackled the difficult issue, finding that the domestic production of PV panels, from polysilicon through to finished modules, is desirable and achievable – however, only with multi-decade support and unwavering support from publicly funded organisations.
The “Silicon to Solar” study goes by the tag the Roadmap. It is an initiative of the Australian Photovoltaic Institute (APVI) funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and results come from collaboration with Deloitte and key industry stakeholders including The Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics (ACAP), AGL, Aspiradac, Energus, Siemens, SunDrive, Tindo Solar and 5B.
Based on detailed technoeconomic analysis for each stage in the solar supply chain, including polysilicon, ingot and wafers, cells and modules, the Roadmap recommends barriers be removed for accelerated PV deployment and financial allocation and delivery for the industry’s supply and demand sides be implemented.
Also in the next 12 months the report recommends a roll out of enabling support for people, permits and partners be prioritised, broad political support be sought, and a budget for selected framework of subsidies be secured.
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said the Roadmap provides a clear vision for Australia’s role as a nation that can manufacture cutting edge solar technology across the supply chain, leveraging some of Australia’s competitive advantages in the sector.
“Australia has already demonstrated its capacity to manufacture advanced technology in other sectors. Solar PV represents an enormous opportunity to apply our skills to a sector that will play a critical role in Australia’s clean energy economy.
“A number of Australian companies have already stated their ambitions to develop local manufacturing of solar PV at scale, and ‘Silicon to Solar’ illuminates the policy and investment pathway to make these bold plans a reality,” Miller said.
Further recommendations for Australian PV manufacturing include examining ways to facilitate a workforce, approvals, permissions, and international partnerships, and developing supply-side policy support levers, including concessional finance and production credits.
Global supply
The Roadmap said over 90% of module supply in Australia comes from China, and the pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine revealed the fragility of global supply chains, highlighting the risks of relying on foreign sources for energy supply and related critical components like solar modules.
Muriel Watt, co-author Silicon to Solar Study said the it compares manufacturing costs in China and Australia for current state-of-the-art technology and explores ways of overcoming cost gaps in each manufacturing stage. It then presents a Roadmap for developing a PV manufacturing value chain in Australia over time, along with policy levers which can be used to facilitate this.
Potential future supply chain disruptions can have a significant impact on both the cost and availability of solar PV modules jeopardising Australia’s decarbonisation targets and ambitions of becoming a renewable energy superpower, the Roadmap found.

Melbourne-based, Friends of the Earth Australia encouraged the community events through its “Yes 2 Renewables” campaign, which advocates for 100% renewable energy by 2030, good jobs and careers in the renewables sector, the role of communities at the centre of the renewables transition, and a fair and just transition for workers.
Wendy Farmer Organiser Friends of the Earth said the shift to renewable energy is crucial for a sustainable future, and it’s heartening to see regional communities championing this critical industry and thousands of job opportunities it represents.”
Kristen McDonald Coordinator Illawarra-based action group Electrify 2515, which has the goal of creating an all-electric community, said it was exciting to think of the opportunities that renewable energy could bring to her north Wollongong community.
“Cleaner air, healthier homes, cheaper bills and local jobs, we just have to make sure we do it with enough speed and ambition to address the climate crisis in time,” McDonald said.
Participating in the Yes 2 Renewables events, the ACTU called for an energy network of wind and solar farms connected to fully renewable industries to help meet the power needs for the next 100 years and beyond.
Michele O’Nell President ACTU said decarbonising the economy could create hundreds of thousands of good jobs, healthier communities, and a renewed national prosperity, while safeguarding Australians from spiralling climate crisis.
“Renewables have proven time and again that they’re the cheapest form of energy. More renewables on the grid means lower power bills – incredibly important during this cost-of-living crisis,” O’Nell said.

Researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia have investigated the effects of wildfires on the electricity production of rooftop PV systems and have concluded that residential solar arrays could be used for wildfire detection and monitoring, due to their sensitivity to smoke.
In the study “Quantifying the impact of wildfire smoke on solar photovoltaic generation in Australia,” published in eScience, the academics explained their analysis considered the wildfires that hit their home country between 2019 and 2020, which they described as disasters of national and even global proportions. “The fire burnt an estimated area of 243,000 km2, led to the loss of 33 lives, killed countless animals, destroyed thousands of buildings, and released more than 700 million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere,” they explained.
The academics stressed that wildfire smoke affects PV system performance by reducing solar irradiance and causing soiling through the deposition of particles on the solar panels.
Their analysis comprised 160 residential PV installations with a power range of 0.5 kW to 5.4 kW distributed across New South Wales and considered the impact of fine particle concentration on PV performance, which they calculated as a function of the PM2.5 concentration by self-referencing periods without significant PM2.5 concentration. Fine particles in the air are commonly measured as PM2.5. “The PM2.5 concentration represents the number of PM2.5 particles per unit volume of air at the altitude of the PV system,” the scientists specified.
A first analysis of the data showed that the strongest solar power production reductions were seen in the mornings and evenings, with the least impact being at around 1 p.m. “A complete explanation for this symmetrical impact is not yet understood — the air mass AM-correction [air mass-correction] may be incomplete, or daily wind and weather patterns may play a role,” the researchers said.
The UNSW team also determined the impact of the time of day and distance between the site location and PM2.5 measurement station. This, in turn, allowed them to intrinsically correct for soiling when determining power losses due to wildfire smoke.
The average reduction in power generation for all the analysed systems was found to be around 13% per 100 μg/m3 for AM1.0. The total energy loss over the 71 days for all 160 systems was estimated at around 4.2%, with total state-wide energy loss reaching approximately 175 ± 35 GWh during the wildfire period.
