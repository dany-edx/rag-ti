Ausgrid is yet to put out an official media release about Bankstown’s new community battery, but it appears to be a Tesla PowerPack. This is different from the first community battery installed in February at Beacon Hill, north of Sydney, which was a  a 150 kW / 267 kWh MTU Energy Pack QS.
The community batteries will enable Bankstown residents to participate in the trial, which will see them able to store up to 10 kWh of excess solar energy each day at no cost. This excess energy will be credited against their electricity use for that day, and eventually credits will be paid to the participant each quarter via bank transfer.
“Our battery will harness and store solar power from local homes, providing savings and allowing for more renewable energy into the grid,” Ausgrid said in its Twitter post about the launch.
“Put simply, a community battery allows multiple households within a certain radius to ‘share’ a storage system for the excess energy generated by solar panels. This can save households thousands of dollars on the upfront cost of an individual battery, and allow them to effectively use more of the solar energy their home systems generate – bringing down their electricity costs,” Ausgrid CEO Richard Gross previously said of the trial.
The trial is in a similar vein to those underway other states, most notably Western Australia. Run by retailer Synergy and network operator Western Power, WA’s highly successful PowerBank trial last week announced its expansion. Its latest edition, PowerBank 3, is the largest in the scheme to date with up to 600 Western Australian households able to leverage battery storage technology. It follows the installation of nine 116 kW batteries across the state late last year.
Likewise, Victoria’s CitiPower and Yarra Energy Foundation announced in January they will parter to create a community battery network in the Melbourne CBD and inner-city suburbs.

Lion Energy, an Indonesian focused oil and gas production company, today announced it plans to “explore opportunities” in green hydrogen in Australia and on Seram Island in Indonesia.
The company, which is Indonesia-focused but listed as Australian, has received firm commitments for $2.8 million from its capital raising round to conduct the studies.
Lion Energy has appointed boutique Melbourne company Peak Asset Management to leads its hydrogen exploration. “We are pleased to work with the team at Peak to support Lion’s legacy business and related new hydrogen studies and our potential foray into the Australian clean energy space. Peak brings a wealth of experience in supporting companies with green hydrogen and renewable investment businesses in Australia,” Lion’s Executive Chairman, Tom Soulsby, said.
Following the news, the company’s stock price rose sharply.
Earlier this week, Australia’s federal government announced a further $275.5 million to develop four new hydrogen hubs in regional Australia. This follows millions already committed by state and federal governments across the country.
Much like cryptocurrencies, green hydrogen projects have become highly sought after in the past few months. On Monday, Province Resources grew its green hydrogen project plans from 1 GW to a massive 8 GW after signing an early-stage agreement with French powerhouse Total Eren to partner on the project.

European Solliance Solar Research (Solliance), a consortium based in the Netherlands, has achieved a 28.7% power conversion efficiency on a transparent perovskite solar cell combined with a crystalline silicon solar cell in a four-terminal tandem configuration.
The device is based on an 18.6% efficient highly near-infrared transparent perovskite cell built by Dutch research institute TNO, EnergyVille, a joint venture between the Flemish research partners KU Leuven, VITO, UHasselt, and Imec, and the Eindhoven University of Technology, which are all members of Solliance, and a prototype of a c-Si interdigitated back contact (IBC) silicon heteroJunction (SHJ) cell developed by Japanese electronics manufacturer Panasonic.
Improvements on the perovskite solar cell, which measures 9 mm2, were the decisive factor to increase the overall efficiency of the tandem cell by around 1.5%, the researchers stated, adding that they tuned the optoelectrical properties of the perovskite solar cell to better match the optical properties of the other cell. “Next, we determined the loss factors in the four-terminal configuration and minimised these step by step,” said TNO researcher Dong Zhang. “Finally, we optimised the light management of the complete tandem device, in other words, we maximised light absorption in the tandem solar cell.”
The perovskite cell was also combined with other kinds of solar cells and remarkable efficiencies were also achieved. In combination with a commercial c–Si metal wrap through (MWT) SHJ cell co-developed by TNO and Japanese solar manufacturer Chosu Industry, the efficiency reached 28.2%. In another combination with a c-Si PERC cell provided by Solarlab Aiko Europe GmbH, the German subsidiary of Chinese module maker Aiko, the efficiency was 27.7%.
Furthermore, the research team combined the transparent perovskite cell with a flexible copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) tandem solar cell built by MiaSolé Hi-Tech, a U.S. unit of Chinese thin-film specialist Hanergy, and the efficiency was 27.0%.
“These excellent results form the basis for the next phase in the development, which includes upscaling of the area and the processes,” said researcher Mehrdad Najafi. “Currently, low–cost upscaling processes for large area modules and maintaining the same performance are being developed by the Solliance partners TNO and imec/EnergyVille.”
The scientists also specified that the four-terminal perovskite/c–Si tandem cell could be applied in bifacial c–Si solar modules, as it is able to deliver a total power generation density of 320 W/m², depending on the albedo.
Solliance announced a 26.5% power conversion efficiency for a solar cell combining two different thin-film PV technologies in a tandem configuration in February. In November 2019, MiaSolé announced a new record of 18.64% for a flexible CIGS cell. The landmark achievement represented a significant improvement on the previous record of 17.44%, set five months earlier. In January 2019, the consortium achieved a 21.5% efficiency for a flexible copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) tandem solar cell based on perovskite.
Solliance and the TNO had also said in March 2018 that they had recorded a 26.3% efficiency rate on a transparent perovskite solar cell combined with a crystalline silicon solar cell. A month later, Solliance also announced a new record performance for large-area perovskite modules, with a 14.5% conversion efficiency level.

Furthermore, the collapse of the cost of renewables in the last three years means half of this solar and wind potential is now economically viable, and by the end of the decade it will be over 90%.
“The technical and economic barriers [for renewables] have been crossed and the only impediment to change is political,” said the report, which was authored by Carbon Tracker’s Kingsmill Bond, Ed Vaughan, Sam Butler-Sloss, as well as Harry Benham from think tank Ember-Climate.

Australia, along with Africa South America “stand out as having huge technical potential compared to energy demand,” the authors found.
“In terms of the renewable energy potential per person, Australia is in a league of its own with over 10,000 MWh per person per annum. With vast renewable potential and a low population, it is thus well positioned to become the battery of the world.”
The authors caveat this, however, noting that Australia’s geographic characteristics may not necessarily lend themselves for exports.

Due to Australia’s abundance of space, the report says its unlikely Australia (like Africa and Russia) will need to invest much in offshore wind platforms.
The report also looked into the land required to power the world only from solar PV panels, finding that 450,000 square kilometres would be needed, just 0.3% of the global land area, which is 149 million square kilometres. This obviously variously between countries – with Australia again in luck, ranking among the world’s most abundant.
Interestingly, Carbon Tracker says the space needed to fit enough solar panels to power the world is actually less than the land required for fossil fuels today, which in the U.S. alone is 126,000 square kilometres or 1.3% of the country.
At wind and solar’s current growth rate between 15% to 20%, the think tank forecast that fossil fuels will be pushed out of the electricity sector by the mid-2030s and out of total energy supply by 2050.

Countries in the global south are the greatest beneficiaries of the shift towards solar and wind. “They have the largest ratio of solar and wind potential to energy demand and stand to unlock huge domestic benefits,” the report outlines.
“The continent of Africa for example is a renewables superpower, with 39% of global potential,” it finds.
More specifically, countries like Namibia has a renewables potential more than 1,000 times their energy demand. On the other end of the spectrum are countries like South Korea, which has a potential just 10 times its energy demand.

Germany is another example of a country with low potential and high demand. While it is a prime example of an industrial country, Germany has the third lowest solar and wind resources in the world compared to its total demand. That is, Germany is not very sunny, densely populated, and has high energy demand.
Nonetheless, it’s a global renewables leader. “If the Germans can find solutions, then so can everyone else,” authors of the report write.

This morning, South Australian company Renascor Resources seems to have taken a lead in the race, announcing it has raised enough to fund its Siviour Battery Anode Material Project to the construction phase, which is set to begin next year, 2022.
Renascor Resources
The $15 million raised (before costs) was led by “institutional investors” in Australia and overseas, with their monetary commitments to fund the completion of all technical, regulatory and marketing work streams as the company works towards reaching a final investment decision on the Siviour Project, it said in its ASX announcement.
Renascor’s Siviour Project is essentially a vertically integrated battery anode material manufacturing operation in South Australia which includes the $118 million Siviour Graphite Mine and Concentrator located on the Eyre Peninsula, 15km west of Arno Bay. It also includes a $90 million Purified Spherical Graphite (PSG) Manufacturing Facility nominally located in Port Adelaide.
The company is sitting on the world’s second largest Proven Reserve of Graphite and the largest Graphite Reserve outside of Africa. It says it will be able to create Graphite Concentrate at among the lowest costs in the world, “competitive with current Chinese production and advantaged over other developments outside of China.”
Renascor Resources
There are a handful of other companies vying to get in early, banking on market appetite for diversifying purified spherical graphite supply chains outside of a single country, China. Norway, Sweden and Germany are all in the game, and closer to home Western Australian start-up, International Graphite are well on their way.
Given the market is hardly flooded, International Graphite’s CEO Neil Rinaldi believes increased production will only drive demand. “There’s room of us, there’s room for others. I think the industry only benefits from having more participants,” told pv magazine Australia.
Back over in South Australia, Renascor has already signed three non-binding off-take agreements, one of which will see its product used in Japan. The company said it is now seeking to potentially expand its facility’s proposed production capacity beyond its initial stage one of 28,000 tonnes per year “on the back of the strong inbound demand for the Siviour PSG product.”

Italian start-up Genius Watter has developed a desalination solution that is powered exclusively by photovoltaics and is claimed to be an ideal solution for rural areas with no connection to grid electricity.
“We have completed a project in Cape Verde in 2020 and we are now developing [an]other five projects, of which three are expected to be built in 2021,” the company chairman, Franco Traverso, who is also the chairman of the U.S.-Canadian solar module manufacturer Silfab, told pv magazine.
The battery-free reverse osmosis desalination system is fully containerised and thermally insulated. It is able to produce up to 1,000m3 of potable water per day and is claimed to have a life cycle of more than 30 years.
The company’s patented technology is said to enable the efficient operation of the desalination unit at variable frequencies, depending on irradiation levels. According to Genius Watter, more than 90% of the available net PV energy is converted to potable water. A storage tank to store water, with a capacity from 50m to 1,000m3 can be also installed within the system’s fenced spot and used for water demand during nighttime or on cloudy days. According to Traverso, the desalination unit needs maintenance work only twice a year, which would be required to refill consumables and change filters.
The system is currently available in two versions, for brackish water and seawater desalination. The former version can be built with freshwater output ranging from 20m3 to 500m3 per day and a required PV capacity of 9.6 kW to 241.1 kW. The seawater model may be deployed with the same freshwater capacity and a required PV capacity of 31.6 kW to 709.6 kW.
Genius Watter
Each system has a solar-powered water pumping unit that is able to pump feed water from 250m underground and supply constant pressure to the reverse-osmosis unit. The proposed solution may also be equipped with an automatic chlorination and re-mineralization unit to deliver potable water meeting World Health Organisation (WHO) standards. It may also be coupled with an additional power source if constant daily water volumes are necessary.
Genius Watter is offering the desalination solution with its own, patented drone technology for underground water aquifer detection, which is claimed to be able to precisely detect volume, depth, and GPS positioning of water sources at a depth of up to 300m.
The cost of the system, including the PV system, is less than €4000/m3/ day. “For a 90m3/day plant of desalinated brackish water, the turnkey cost of the plant, installed in an African country, would be around €330,000,” Traverso explained, adding that the system is produced in Italy by an undisclosed manufacturer with 30 years of experience in desalination and is then tested at Genius Watter’s headquarters in Carmignano di Brenta.

According to the CEO, the system can produce water for agricultural use at an opex of only €0.20/m3.
The company is also considering the possibility of becoming an independent water producer itself through the water-as-a-service financing model. “It is clear that when the water is sold instead of the asset, the sale price of the same increases considerably to leave room for the right margin for the investor who must obtain a reasonable return on his investment,” Traverso highlighted. “Even in this case, however, the selling price of the cubic meter of desalinated water is normally competitive, not to mention the advantages of the environmental and social sustainability of the system for obtaining the water and distributing it to users.”
The system is claimed to be particularly suitable for irrigation and livestock farming in semi-desert and coastal areas but also for islands that are affected by a scarcity of fresh water, especially in the summer months when solar radiation is greater.
