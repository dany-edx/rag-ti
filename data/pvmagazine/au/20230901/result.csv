The Paris-headquartered renewable energy giant revealed the target after announcing its portfolio of renewable energy generation and storage projects has reached 3.3 GW of capacity in operation or under construction in Australia, cementing its position as the country’s biggest renewable energy developer.
Neoen has in the past decade invested more than $4 billion (USD 2.59 billion) in Australian projects but Neoen Australia Managing Director Louis de Sambucy said the company is now planning a multi-billion dollar spend as it looks increase its portfolio to 10 GW of renewables capacity by 2030.
De Sambucy said the company’s ambition is to have highly competitive solar, wind and storage assets in every state, and to leverage this multi-technology portfolio to design the solutions of the future for the grid and for energy customers.
“We are strongly committed to continuing to play a decisive role in Australia’s clean energy future,” he said, noting that the company already has an extensive development pipeline in place.
Neoen’s portfolio of 20 assets in operation or under construction consists of 2 GW of generation capacity evenly split between solar and wind and 1.3 GW/2.8 GWh of battery energy storage. This accounts for approximately 45% of Australia’s grid-scale battery storage and 10% of both the country’s utility-scale solar and wind capacity.
The company’s Australian projects include the world’s first big battery – the now 150 MW/193.5 MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia – and the 300 MW/450 MWh Victorian Big Battery, which is currently Australia’s largest battery.
Its PV projects include the recently commissioned 400 MW Western Downs Solar Farm in Queensland. Developed on a 1,500-hectare site near Chinchilla in Queensland’s southwest, the project will also include a 270 MW/540 MWh battery energy storage system.
Neoen said being an owner and operator is a central feature of the company’s approach, allowing it to invest in internal capabilities across the project lifecycle, including its operational control centre in Canberra which monitors the portfolio and manages its market trading.
Neoen Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Xavier Barbaro said the Australian market has helped to inform the company’s global operations.
“It is a model and an inspiration for us internationally, and it is a source of much of our innovation,” he said. “Neoen is a key player in Australia and Australia is Neoen’s number one country.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/01/mpower-starts-building-after-purchase-of-5-mw-narromine-project-completed/,"FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2023",MPower starts building after purchase of 5 MW Narromine project completed,"Sydney-based MPower announced it has successfully completed the purchase of all the project rights, including connection agreement and key planning approvals for the 5 MW Narromine Solar Farm being developed near Dubbo in western New South Wales (NSW).
MPower, which agreed to acquire the designated site in mid-2021, said it paid approximately $1.4 million (USD 910,000) for the project rights and the acquisition of inverter equipment which has been pre-ordered as part of the project development plans.
MPower Chief Executive Officer Nathan Wise said with all necessary permits secured and funding in place, the company will now immediately commence construction at the Narromine site.
“We are pleased to confirm completion of the purchase agreement and get started on the next phase of development,” he said.
Construction of the project, which will comprise more than 12,000 bifacial PV modules, is expected to be completed within 12 months. MPower said the project will connect into the Essential Energy network, generating approximately 14,000 MWh of electricity in its first year of operations.
The Narromine project forms part of MPower’s broader strategy to establish a build, own and operate portfolio of up to 20 sub-5 MW solar farms across Australia.
Wise has previously said the company’s focus is on projects of 5 MW or less as they can avoid some of the more protracted grid connection processes the utility-scale segment is prone to.
“We couldn’t get comfortable with some of the risks around large-scale renewable energy projects, in particular the grid and connection risks that are really part and parcel of those larger projects,” he said.
“We identified the advantages of these small utility-scale projects, in particular the relatively short time it takes to both develop and construct them, but also the ease of connection and the ability to export power as and when you generate rather than being under the direct control of the market operator.”
The finalisation of the Narromine purchase follows MPower’s recent acquisitions of the operational Lakeland solar and storage project in north Queensland, which features a 10.8 MW solar farm and a 1.4 MW/5.3 MWh battery energy storage system, and a shovel ready project at Faraday in Victoria.
“This acquisition builds of the key operational milestones that MPower has already achieved in the year to-date, including the procurement of an unconditional $10 million funding facility and the material value accretive measures carried out across its existing asset portfolio,” Wise said.
“We look forward to bringing our latest clean energy project to the domestic power grid and further expanding our project development suite in the months and years ahead.”

The WA government said in a statement the current rules that govern the state’s electricity sector are nearly two decades old and are “not well suited to maintaining a secure and reliable power system or maximising the opportunities for a well-managed transition to a decarbonised energy sector.”
“The pace of Western Australia’s unprecedented energy transformation is changing the way we produce, store, and consume electricity, however, the primary legislation governing WA’s electricity sector is outdated and nearly 20-years-old,” it said.
“Changes are necessary to keep pace with a rapidly transitioning power system, adapting to the efficient integration of new technologies.”
Energy Policy WA said the Electricity Industry Amendment (Distributed Energy Resources) Bill 2023 has been designed to enable the uptake of new technologies such as rooftop solar, battery storage and electric vehicles and to support the state government’s commitment to net zero by 2050.
The bill introduces a State Electricity Objective (SEO) that the government said will minimise barriers to investment in lower-emission technologies while retaining a focus on the long-term interests of consumers with respect to the price, reliability and security of electricity.
The bill also amends the Electricity Industry Act 2004 to remove duplication, consolidating the rules and codes into the Electricity System and Market Rules (ESMR). It will also enable new technologies to support and participate in the power system.
Energy Minister Bill Johnston said the bill, developed in consultation with industry and consumer representatives, will provide a flexible, responsive, and future-focused regulatory framework.
“The amendments are the next step to modernising governance arrangements, to keep pace with an electricity industry that is accelerating towards a low-emissions future,” he said.
“A new electricity objective will empower decision-makers to consider the energy trilemma – sustainability, reliability and affordability, ensuring that decisions are made for the long-term interest of all Western Australians.
“The amendments will future-proof the existing governance framework, by providing provisions to better manage and incorporate rooftop solar, battery storage, and electric vehicles.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/01/warnings-over-grid-reliability-really-about-building-more-transmission-lines/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2023",Warnings over grid reliability really about building more transmission lines,"This week, we heard one of the strongest warnings yet from Daniel Westerman, head of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).
Much of the media coverage has framed his comments as a warning about the anticipated angry El Niño summer, which is likely to drive energy-intensive aircon use even as our coal plants become less and less reliable.
But this isn’t what the warning is really about. It’s about transmission lines and our sluggish pace of change. Australia’s emissions are falling much more slowly than we’d like to think, if we omit the sometimes controversial land use sector. We’re down just 1.6% below 2005 levels.
Solar and wind farm investment has slowed markedly. This is because we don’t have the right grid – yet. Building the transmission infrastructure needed to slash emissions by 2030 means acting much faster than government is used to.
These aren’t ordinary times. We can’t act as if they are.
It’s quite likely the grid will withstand this summer, as long as maintenance is done to keep the old coal clunkers running and to ensure gas peaking plants are ready for times of highest demand. We also have the reserve system, whereby big energy users can be paid not to consume electricity during the hottest days.
There’s no shortage of solar and wind resources in Australia. And there’s no shortage of solar and wind farm projects waiting to be built. But the great renewable build is stalling – not because there’s no demand for cheap power, but because regulatory approvals are too slow and there’s no way to get the power to the cities and heavy industries.

The real problem is we’re not moving fast enough to build the unsexy but vital infrastructure we need: new transmission lines. The old grid was built around big power stations, from hydro in the Snowy Mountains to coal plants near coal mines, with transmission lines connecting them to cities.
But renewable-rich zones are often in different places. What’s more, shifting to a grid full of renewables means building more interconnectors between states, so on a big day for Victoria’s mooted offshore wind farms, for instance, the surplus power can be sent to South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland too.
What’s the delay? After all, we were able to build transmission lines when the current grid was taking shape.
A big part of the issue is community pushback and process. Local farmers and communities are resisting many of the planned new transmission lines.
If we had the luxury of time, it might be possible to get strong community support. But we don’t. Our coal plants are on the way out and no one is going to build a new one. The barrier between us and a clean energy future is getting transmission and storage built, fast.
Labor went to the 2022 election with a $20 billion plan to build the transmission lines envisaged by AEMO in its latest integrated system plan.
Westerman last year listed the five most urgent transmission links:
Most of these projects have had their own issues, ranging from lengthy approval processes, to heated community calls to put lines underground, to cost blowouts.
One problem is the range of government agencies involved. There’s no single body responsible for making these nation-building projects happen as quickly and happily as possible.

Here are a few ideas:
We’ve come a fair way down the road in our efforts to wean ourselves off coal, and, eventually, gas-fired electricity. But it could all be for nought if we don’t get transmission sorted as soon as possible.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/01/allume-lands-2-3-million-to-support-roll-out-of-solshare-tech-in-u-s/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",PV MAGAZINE,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2023",Allume lands $2.3 million to support roll out of Solshare tech in U.S.,"Allume Energy has received a $2.3 million (USD 1.5 million) bridge investment from United States-based investors Elemental Excelerator and the Schmidt Family Foundation which it will use to deploy its technology and bring rooftop solar to more than 4,000 residents in the country’s southeast, beginning with solar projects in Florida, Georgia and Mississippi.
Solar PV systems tend to be designed for one-to-one connections and deploying them in multi-unit buildings can pose unique challenges. Asset owners pay for the systems, but residents benefit from lower utility costs, according to Mel Bergsneider, executive account manager at Allume Energy. Solar PV systems also have a lifespan that exceeds the short-term stays of apartment renters.
The company’s behind-the-meter technology, called SolShare, helps address this “split incentive” challenge by allocating power to common areas and apartment units. It is able to allocate the solar energy generated by rooftop panels to each grid meter. In addition, it also keeps tabs on the building’s energy demand, and delivers solar energy in a way that maximizes solar consumption and provides bill savings.
Residents in apartments can lower their utility bills by using on-site solar power and reducing their consumption from the grid, Bergsneider told pv magazine.
“Direct access to solar can protect against increasing utility rates. Each kWh consumed from solar PV helps residents avoid rising electric grid charges,” Bergsneider said.

The company estimates that its technology can help residents save up to 40% on their electricity bills. Participants in its first pilot project in the U.S., that saw a 165 kWdc rooftop system installed at a 296-unit apartment complex in Orlando, delivered average annual savings of almost $1,800 (USD 1,166) per apartment in the first year, the company reported. This included net metering credit savings.
The company also has a project in Jackson, Mississippi, and will soon begin installing its third U.S. project in Orlando. The Mississippi project, which was announced in March, is located at a multi-family building with a 22 kW solar array, installed by Louisiana-based contractor Solar Alternatives. Allume’s next projects in the southeast are continuing into the end of the third quarter and beginning of fourth quarter, Bergsneider said.
Until recently, solar technology has largely been saving money for people who already have it, Cameron Knox, Allume’s CEO and co-founder, said.
“We need to ensure we include everyone in the energy transition. This partnership will ensure low-income communities can benefit from clean, affordable energy from the sun,” Knox said.
Elemental Excelerator is a non-profit climate technologies investor, with a portfolio of more than 150 companies, while the Schmidt Family Foundation is a philanthropic initiative focused on renewable energy, resilient food systems, and other areas.
“We originally invested in Allume Energy because they are leaders in bringing affordable solar to affordable housing. We could all use an extra $1,000 a year in our pocketbooks rather than spent on electricity bills,” Dawn Lippert, founder and CEO of Elemental Excelerator, said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/01/google-to-sell-rooftop-solar-mapping-data/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2023",Google to sell rooftop solar mapping data,"Technology giant Google has announced it will sell application programming interfaces (API) datasets for the solar industry, empowering business operations with large, interactable data for understanding rooftop solar potential.
The Solar API contains key building, rooftop, shading, and panel configuration data covering more than 320 million buildings in 40 countries, with the goal of helping accelerate the transition to clean, renewable, solar energy. The company said it expects to drive up to $154 million (USD 100 million) in revenues from sales of its API in the first year alone.
“By using the Solar API, solar businesses can improve the customer experience for interested property owners, create reliable project proposals without requiring an on-site visit, and expedite the overall installation process,” Google said.
Google is known in the solar industry for its Project Sunroof, a free application that helps homeowners understand their estimated bill savings potential for installing rooftop solar. The new Solar API builds on years of collaboration with industry leaders to develop datasets that fit their business needs.
The Solar API includes 3D dataset access for individual building data as well as for aggregated data for all buildings in a particular city or county.

Included in the Solar API is a buildings insights endpoint, which provides details of a building’s location, dimensions, and solar potential. It contains information like the size and slope of the roof and the modeled energy production of a rooftop array.
The API also contains a data layers endpoint, which produces granular details on raw solar information for the area surrounding a building. Data layers include shading and obstructions and the roof layout to assist detailed system placement and layout. The data can be used to create custom solar proposals and by software-as-a-service developers to automate the design of more efficient arrays.
A pilot project user and Solar API customer Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO) used the API to create Suncle, an online rooftop solar energy simulation.
“By inputting an address, homeowners can locate their residence on the map, and adjust their electricity bill and solar installation size as they wish. They can find out installation costs, local subsidies available, cost savings, break even point, and how much impact their solar installation could have on reducing CO2, all in a few seconds. To get these figures without Suncle, they would need to have installers visit their house,” says Masami Jenkins, director, environment & social business design lab, TEPCO.
More information can be found on Google’s Solar API webpage and the related documentation page. A demo of the product can be found here.
