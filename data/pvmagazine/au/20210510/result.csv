Chinese electric utility the State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC) has signed a huge residential PV installation contract with Jolywood which, at first glance, appears to potentially be worth more than three-and-a-half times the market value of the solar manufacturer.
SPIC, through its 70% holding in the newly-established Shanghai Yuanye New Energy joint venture (JV) set up with Jolywood, has awarded an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) deal to install 7.2 GW of residential solar panels over five years.
Under the terms of the arrangement, Jolywood will fit 1.2 GW of household solar within a year, with a further 1.5 GW to follow annually for the remainder of the contract.
Based on a current investment cost of around RMB3.50 per Watt ($0.54) for household solar, the total value of the five-year deal would be RMB25.2 billion ($3.92 billion). Jolywood, which produces tunnel-oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) modules, had a market value of RMB6.8 billion ($1.06 billion) at the end of April and the RMB4.2 billion ($654 million) which might be expected from the first year of the new EPC contract alone would represent 83% of the manufacturer’s revenue last year.
However, with solar panel manufacturing input costs rising, the state-owned electric company appears to have determined the time is opportune to fix its price for PV and the pressure will be on the manufacturer to maintain its margins over the five-year contract period.
Factory explosions and flooding last year led to a shortage of polysilicon which saw the price of the solar panel raw material more than double in the second half. A lack of chips during the first three months of this year has driven panel prices up further and shortages of EVA backsheets, cables and glass have further pressured input costs.
The contract also stipulates a performance guarantee by Jolywood subsidiary Zhonglai Minsheng amounting to 10% of its shares in the Shanghai Yuanye New Energy JV plus 5% of the total contract value.
The deal was entered into by Jolywood subsidiaries Zhonglai Minsheng and Zhonglai Energy Engineering, with the JV.
The extensive contract would account for a significant chunk of China’s residential PV market, which saw 5.3 GW of household solar added in 2019 and 10.1 GW last year and which is expected to continue to grow this year, to an estimated 15 GW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/10/a-string-of-off-grid-solar-powered-data-centres-will-transform-regional-business/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MAY 10, 2021",A string of off-grid solar-powered data centres will transform regional business,"Six weeks into operating its first solar-powered, off-grid data centre, in regional Grafton, Edge Centres today announced a joint venture that will roll out its model for carbon-positive data crunch and distribution in Japan.
Did we miss something? Founder of Edge Centres, Jonathan Eaves this morning told pv magazine Australia that he and a close-knit team wanted to get one of the autonomous centres powered by its adjacent 1 MW solar array and backed up by lithium-ion battery storage to provide always-on technology (AOT), up and running before doing a song and dance.
Even now, with Grafton (known as EC1) subscribed to by a Singapore-based edge-computing cloud provider, and also running environmental monitoring for the city of Grafton itself, and with two further centres about to go live — Dubbo (EC4)  in July, Bendigo (EC3) in August — Eaves is remarkably low-key about a service that is set to put regional Australia on a par with metro communications technology for the first time ever.
Edge Centre’s appeal in Japan is similar. Although Japan has a smaller landmass and a larger population, it still “periodically experiences significant internet challenges at far-edge locations”, says Eaves.
In Japan, Edge Centres is partnering with IT strategy firm Alan Kei Associates and expects to launch its first data centre later this year in the Kanto region, which will be used as a showcase for government and commercial clients, with another site already planned for the south-western island of Kyushu.
Julian Lloyd, Managing Partner and Co-Founder of Alan Kei Associates, says that although the Japanese data centre market is concentrated in Tokyo and Osaka, “There remain many opportunities in other cities around Japan which will enable growth of high-tech innovation hubs and support the Japanese government’s many digital transformation initiatives.”
In Australia, regional data processing still generally occurs in metropolitan-based data centres, taking time and extra processing power to make the long return journey to more remote areas.
Eaves paints a sample picture of data coming from a smart agrotech tractor working autonomously in regional New South Wales that may currently travel all the way to Sydney, then Sydney has to correlate and compute that data, get an outcome and send it back.
“Processing at the edge reduces that time, but it also reduces the workload on the internet,” he says.
The low cost of solar generation, and of locating at the edge where land is cheaper, and of running a virtually autonomous data centre — each Edge centre is remotely monitored and has contracted local computer expertise to attend to repairs and maintenance as needed — also translates into lower data costs for local businesses and service providers.
The megabit-per-second fee for data in regional centres can be as much as three times what metro users pay for that data, and is usually at least twice as expensive, says Eaves.
“We can match what you would pay in any metro centre, because we buy large and we will  have a distributed network that goes from Brisbane, all the way down to Melbourne” — a backbone of regional internet carriage.
Eaves is no stranger to data centre design and construction, having built centres in Australia and in the United Arab Emirates.
He came back from Dubai with a vision to go to the edge, and was trying to get his head around the typical six-month period to energisation, when it occurred to him that solar power could provide a great quick-start solution — which quickly progressed into planning a modular off-grid facility.
“We started work on the Grafton site on March 13, and four weeks later it was live as the world’s first solar-powered, net-zero data centre,” he says.
Edge Centres’ plan is to locate at the top 20 points of interconnection (POIs) on the National Broadband Network within the next two to three years: after Bendigo it will build at Shepparton, Albury, Melbourne, and on, on up and down the Eastern Seaboard.
“If a business in Parkes, Orange, Bathurst or Forbes wants data services, they feed into Dubbo for access,” says Eaves, illustrating how the POIs are the hubs for more remote cities and towns.
The Edge Centres model is carrier neutral, providing any telco an opportunity to extend their network into strategic locations.
One megawatt of solar combined with 48 hours of battery storage and a smart management system integrated with cloud cover forecasting form the heart of each modular data-centre system, which Eaves says can be modified to suit any terrain other than areas that are under snow for much of the year — not good for solar generation.
In Japan, the containerised systems will be modified to withstand earthquake activity; in Australia, they are already rated to operate at greater than 45 degrees Celsius.
Solar energy provides Edge Centres’ facilities with all their onsite power needs: for a consistent 150 kW of IT workload, air-conditioning, energy efficient lighting, security systems such as facial-recognition CCTVs and so on.
The critical factor for data centres is maintaining uptime. Edge Centres have dual solar feed, providing an A and a B supply to each customer’s rack, and multiple inverters on a single phase, which Eaves says provides greater redundancy than power sourced from a traditional utility. Edge Centres also typically generate much more energy than they use, storing excess in banks of lithium ion battery storage
Eaves says that a Japanese solar farm operator first contacted him when they realised that small data centres on the Edge model could be hooked up to their renewable assets to diversify their sources of revenue.
“There are a lot of new players coming that will change the way we look at, and how we deal with internet in Australia,” says Eaves. Having proved that renewables can power this most reliability-conscious of industries, he adds, “It’s the beginning of a new revolution.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/10/sunny-lifestyle-sonnen-australia-adds-ev-subscription-to-its-clean-energy-offering/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MAY 10, 2021",Sunny lifestyle: sonnen Australia adds EV subscription to its clean-energy offering,"Try it, love it, subscribe to electric vehicle (EV) use. Research by Carbar, an Australian subscription service for personal vehicles finds that 57% of drivers say that the high price of purchase is the primary factor holding them back from buying an EV. In response, Carbar has teamed up with sonnen energy storage systems, to offer subscriptions on six models of EV to owners of a sonnenBatterie. 
sonnenDrive launches today as part of the battery manufacturer’s plan to provide integrated technology and service solutions to customers who want to continue to lower their carbon footprint, using renewable energy generated by rooftop solar to power more aspects of their lives.
The subscription service, “makes it easier for customers to take their energy independence on the road by providing flexible, affordable access to an EV and powering it with clean energy,” said Nathan Dunn, CEO for sonnen in the Asia Pacific Region and Managing Director of sonnen Australia.
sonnenDrive prices start at $319 per week for a new 2020 MG ZS EV and range through Nissan LEAF, Hyundai IONIQ hybrid and pure EV models, and Hyundai Kona, up to $447 a week for a new Tesla Model 3.
The subscription includes registration, insurance, maintenance, servicing and roadside assistance, for exclusive use of the vehicle. There is no lock-in contract, but subscribers pay a small upfront fee upon order of the vehicle, and the first four weeks’ subscription is payable on delivery.
Customers are also required to give two weeks’ notice to end a sonnenDrive subscription, or to change vehicles, and each change of vehicle again incurs the small upfront fee.
Carbar Founder and CEO, Des Hang, told pv magazine Australia, “Customers are still testing the water with EVs.” Some may want to “test whether their area has the infrastructure to support it before making that investment”. Others, he says, may choose to “switch to a car subscription when they upgrade” their current vehicle.
Hang adds that, “Carbar’s loyalty program is also baked into this subscription”, meaning the longer you subscribe the more you can save each year on the subscription.
Research by the Electric Vehicle Council of Australia shows that sales of electric vehicles grew 200% in Australia in 2019 — off an admittedly small base.
Carbar’s own, more recent survey of some 580 Australian drivers, including existing car subscribers indicated that 86% of subscribers would consider an EV in the next 12 months. And 69% of responders indicated they would prefer to access an EV via subscription — 11% would opt for car financing, while 5% said they would purchase their EV outright.
“We believe subscriptions will play a huge role in the widespread adoption of this new technology,” said Hang.
The sonnenBatterie’s intelligent energy management system, currently adapts to store and dispatch electricity according to home occupants’ energy-use profile, the rules governing local grid feed-in of excess energy, and weather forecasts that may influence a home’s rooftop solar productivity.
“While there is currently no integration that shows how much energy is used by an EV with the sonnen app, the app displays precisely how much energy is being produced and used in the household so a customer has visibility on how much energy their EV will need,” Dunn told pv magazine Australia.
The amount of energy used by an EV varies according to the model and distance travelled, and Hang says that, “Car monitoring is something Carbar is looking at in response to customer demand and we plan to implement a solution at a later date.”
Owners of a sonnenBatterie may wonder whether they will need to upgrade their storage system to power their new electric four-wheel device.
Dunn explains that the EV can be charged directly through rooftop solar and the sonnenBatterie, and that the car battery itself can provide additional storage support to the home system when needed. He adds that “sonnen customers can upgrade their capacity if they see that they need more storage”.
sonnenBatterie systems range from 5 KWh capacity and can be expanded in blocks of 2.5 KWh up to 15 KWh of storage.
sonnenDrive customers “have the added option available through Carbar to add an EV charger through Jet Charge at home for an $800 estimated one-off fee”, says Dunn.
Although sonnen doesn’t provide figures on its battery installations in each country, it says its number of worldwide installations is now around 60,000. And that the sonnenDrive subscription model has already had success in Europe.
“Our experience with sonnenDrive in Germany has been very positive and we think that the combination of an EV with rooftop solar and energy storage is what the household of the future will look like,” Dunn told pv magazine Australia.

Last month EIF secured $250,000 in Victorian Government funding, under the state’s Agriculture Energy Investment Plan, to further develop a replicable model that will transform the farm gate and everything that happens behind it.
“According to our models, any farm of around 8,000 acres and beyond is a candidate for energy independence,” says Thomas Blair of the Blairfarms dynasty, which grows all kinds of grain in the Wimmera-Mallee region around Horsham, but specialises in lentils and chickpeas in operations that use a total of around $200,000 worth of diesel fuel each year.
That diesel powers not only the farm machinery, but also Blairfarms’ grain-cleaning facility, which runs on diesel-generated power 14 to 18 hours a day.
“Because we’re remote in terms of the grid, we can’t hook up to three-phase power,” Blair explains to pv magazine Australia. He adds, “We’ve been pricing it up for years”, but now he says the price point for going offgrid is comparable — with numerous greater benefits.
Image: Agriculture Victoria
Blair was formerly in the armed forces, and after his last tour of Afghanistan he spent a few years with his mother’s family in Denmark “I needed a bit of time to clear my head,” he says. 
It was in Europe that renewable energy infused his consciousness. “You could go into any household in Denmark, and it wouldn’t be long until the conversation turned to renewables.”
When he returned to the farm at Kalkee in Victoria last year, just before the Covid pandemic hit, Blair says he was familiarising himself with the farm accounts and realised just how much the business was spending on diesel, and the extent of emissions generated.
“That’s how we formulated our first grant application,” he says — for an energy audit — which set Blair on a crusade to reduce the farm’s emissions, “starting with our electricity demands”.
He began with the idea of rooftop solar on farm buildings, to power their needs and perhaps convert the farm’s three forklifts to run on electricity, maybe run some EVs to facilitate employee transport to and from Horsham. The plan kept expanding…
“When I compared fuel-cell EVs versus your standard lithium-battery EVs, I thought, ‘Hydrogen has a lot of potential.’”
His research led him to international energy consultant Bradley Warren, who is also director of Eco U Construction, a building services business based on the Queensland Sunshine Coast that has integrated solar-battery solutions into large real estate and other developments in Australia and overseas. 
Energy Independent Farming is the formalisation of their new business partnership, intended to help farmers contribute to Australia’s decarbonisation, save money on energy and thereby secure their livelihoods as climate conditions for agriculture become less predictable.
This agricultural-renewables journey will begin onsite at Blairfarms, with the installation of three 30 kilowatt solar arrays, and will first investigate the viability of sodium-ion flow batteries to ensure constant power availability, alongside “a new type of inverter that can step it up to three-phase power”, Warren tells pv magazine Australia.
Hydrogen production is a second planned step — using scaled up PV and perhaps supplementary wind generation (Blairfarms is next door to the Murra Warra Wind Farm, and has good wind resource of its own).
There’s also potential, depending on emerging technologies, to skip batteries, and “go straight into hydrogen fuel cells as our storage mechanism, as well as the prime way to move our vehicles and farm machinery”, says Blair. 
The advantage of sticking to one technology in country areas is that farmers would only need to call out one kind of field-service technician to deal with maintenance of their energy-generation equipment.
Sidebar: Within two or three years, Energy Independent Farming wants to have a working model of renewable energy-to hydrogen-to fuel-cell-powered farm equipment, where a new workforce of hydrogen technicians studying at local agricultural colleges can come to learn the ropes as part of their training.
Another positive to on-farm hydrogen generation, says Blair, is the opportunity to make use of contaminated water that results from washing down the massive booms that spray pesticides and herbicides on the farm.
“On broad acreage, chemicals are a necessity,” says Blair, and the cleaning cycle in between using herbicides and pesticides uses thousands of litres of water for rinsing and sterilisation. On farms across Australia, that water is stored in what’s known as a condemned dam: “It kills a lot of the trees and grass around it and looks horrible,” says Blair. EIF intends to trial filtering this water for use in electrolysis.
Sidebar: Using hydrogen fuel cells to power header harvesters, will lower the risk of starting fires during cropping season … “The combustion engine of the header gets very hot, and harvesting generates a powdery dust that easily ignites,” explains Warren. On days of high fire hazard, farmers are frequently restricted from harvesting because of the fire risk, which reduces productivity. A fuel-cell-powered header would pose no such risk, and cropping could continue on schedule.

On a visit to Blairfarms last week, Federal Member for Mallee, Dr Anne Webster, remarked that she was impressed at the ecosystem approach being developed by Blair and Warren. She posted on Facebook, “Tom explained their Energy Independent Farm plans for Zero Emissions Farming and future stages for replicating Energy Independent Farming nationally. Very exciting stuff.”

Blair credits his father Peter’s entrepreneurial farming practices — Peter pioneered on-farm grain cleaning, and also diversified into agricultural machinery, a business which is now developing its future-fuel strategy — for inspiring his own comprehensive modelling of Energy Independent Farming.
“Watching my father, I came to think that it’s possible to achieve these things,” he says. “Now, on the home block in Kalkee, it’s my turn to come up with a new way to empower farmers.”

A group of scientists from the German research institute Fraunhofer Umsicht claims to have reduced the production costs of redox flow batteries by redesigning one of its main components – the stack.
The design of the stacks in redox flow batteries, on the other hand, is complicated by the presence of a number of parameters that can influence the performance. The German group said it developed the stack with an electrically conductive plastic so that it remains flexible and can be welded.
“The stack that has been developed, the heart of any redox flow battery, is 40% more cost-effective in terms of material costs,” said researcher Christian Doetsch, adding that it weighs 80% less than a conventional stack and is only about half the size. The device was fabricated with plastic in the form of pellets, which was then made into powder and mixed with 80% graphite at temperatures as low as minus 80 degrees Celsius.
The powder was then processed through a system comprising several rollers heated to different temperatures and working at different speeds. “The powder is briefly melted between the rollers at moderate temperatures and low pressures,” the scientists explained. “It is then kneaded, rolled into an ‘endless sheet’ and finally rolled up.”
The resulting flexible material is claimed to have thermoplastic properties and to be easy to weld. “The stack uses no gaskets whatsoever, and even screws are unnecessary — the cells are simply welded together,” the scientists stated. “Bipolar plates up to several square meters in size can be manufactured without problems.”
In a second step, which the research team described as crucial to further reduce production costs, the plates can be produced as an endless roll through a powder-to-roll process, which is said to require much less material. “Very thin plates can be produced in this way,” the researchers concluded. “In the injection moulding process, the plate thickness is limited to several millimetres due to the production method, but in the powder-to-roll process it can be between 0.1 and 0.4 millimetres.”
Fraunhofer Umsicht’s spin-off Volterion GmbH was also involved in the development of the new stack design and will be responsible for making it into a commercial solution.

Invinity was formed when two complementary vanadium redox flow battery companies — UK-based RedT and North American innovators Avalon Battery — merged in April 2020.
At 2 MW/8MWh Yadlamalka Energy’s storage solution is Invinity’s largest solar-powered vanadium flow battery to be built to date, and is co-located with a 6 MW solar PV array on land held by the Yadlamalka Land Trust, adjacent to Yadlamalka Station.
A 1000-square-kilometre sheep and cattle farm 60 kilometres north of Port Augusta, Yadlamalka is the family property of Andrew Dorman, a former senior director of McKinsey and an entrepreneur with a passion for investing in new technologies that help to combat climate change. 
Dorman is the main investor in the Yadlamalka Energy project, which is also supported by an Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) grant of $5.7 million.
pv magazine Australia: This is the largest vanadium flow battery to be constructed by Invinity to date, and perhaps the largest of its type in the world. Is this a demonstration case for the capabilities of vanadium flow technology?
Matt Harper: It’s certainly the first example of a project, close coupled with solar, where we are operating as a direct producer of electricity onto the grid. Most of our projects to date have been in behind-the-meter applications where we’re installing our batteries in service of electricity users or companies who are trying to decrease their electricity costs, so they’re using the battery to offset peak tariff period utilisation, or they’re looking to more effectively manage their own solar generation, say on the roof of a factory. 
You’ve said that grids increasingly powered by renewables really need a diversity of storage technologies. Why do we need more than lithium ion?
The fundamental difference between a lithium ion battery and a vanadium flow battery is that in vanadium flow batteries, you don’t have the same cycle charge degradation that you see with other technologies. You know, when you charge and discharge your cell phone battery, in two or three years you’ve lost 20% or 30% or 40% of the charge. In terms of building large-scale, heavy infrastructure for the electricity grid, you need something more durable. It doesn’t mean that lithium ion batteries aren’t good grid participants. They are tremendous for replacing so-called peaking power plants, that are required to dispatch for a few hours on maybe 50 or 100 days of the year to meet the absolute highest demand on the grid.
But we’re focused on working exclusively with renewable power, in this case solar energy, and taking a portion of that generation from the middle of the day to shift it, every day, into the evening peak period, when that electricity is most in demand and is most valuable. And because we don’t have that sort of degradation every time we charge and discharge the battery, we can do that every day of the year to match the 20- to 30-year life of solar or wind-generating plants colocated with the battery.
How much more expensive are vanadium flow batteries compared to lithium ion?
They’re slightly more expensive today for the initial capital cost, but if you look at the cost of every megawatt hour delivered by the battery over its lifetime, they’re significantly less expensive.
Why do you think we don’t have more of them in the grid to date, is the technology just new and untested?
The technology was actually invented at the University of New South Wales back in the late 1980s. But it’s really only in the last five to 10 years that there have been significant deployments of vanadium flow batteries to commercial industrial facilities. Bringing any new technology into the grid to serve a large part of grid users’ needs takes a long time. Think about solar power: solar panels were invented, or first built in large numbers in the late 1970s, early 1980s, but it took three decades before they started to become a meaningful part of the generation mix on the electricity grid. Similarly, lithium ion batteries were invented in around that same timeframe, and it’s really only in the last five or six years that lithium batteries have become a big part of the energy mix. We argue that the vanadium flow battery is complementary to these two types of devices, that it takes over where lithium leaves off in terms of providing that day-to-day very long-duration cycle. But when it comes to the grid, no-one wants to be first.
How is Yadlamalka’s grid connection progressing.
We are in the middle of the regulatory process. The advantage that we have in this case is that we can serve multiple applications within this one site. For example, not only are we taking solar in the middle of the day and deploying in the evening when it’s needed. The battery will also participate in some of the regulation services that help the local grid maintain frequency, voltages and sufficiency of energy 24 hours a day. From the grid operator’s perspective this project is hugely beneficial. It may be a new approach, so there isn’t necessarily a crystal clear regulatory path for us to go down, but our interests and the interests of the regulator are very well aligned. So, where we don’t necessarily fit the common mould we’ve been able to come to an effective resolution that’s acceptable for everyone.
Are you generally supporting the National Electricity Market, with this battery, or is there a local need for energy-shifting at Yadlamalka?
It is very much a local set of constraints that pushed in this direction. Originally, the landowner  wanted to install solar and found that it was going to be difficult to connect to the grid because of some of the local capacity constraints. What our battery is allowing him to do is to modulate when that power flows out onto the grid and therefore get a larger solar project installed in the local area.
What does it mean to Invinity to have ARENA support this project?
First of all, we’re enormously grateful for their financial support. Without their contribution, it would have been much harder to make the project come together. There’s a higher degree of risk that comes along with a project like this, especially with some of the regulatory hurdles and new-technology integration challenges. The other aspect is that on my side of the world, up in Canada, ARENA has a tremendous reputation for its ability to nurture the adoption of new and emerging technologies onto the grid, to help advance sustainability and greenhouse gas targets while at the same time building an economically stable future energy system.
Do you expect that ARENA’s publication of the results of this project will validate the deployment of vanadium-flow batteries at scale on the grid?
It’s one of the things we’re most excited about. It’s all well and good for us to go to the market and talk about the things that we’re doing, but for us to be involved in this project with a third party agency like ARENA who are independently observing, recording and publishing the results of the project is a huge piece of external validation.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/10/the-best-radiative-cooling-tech-for-pv-arrays/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 10, 2021",The best radiative cooling tech for PV arrays,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China have conducted a review of the possible combinations between radiative cooling (RC) techniques and solar energy systems of different kinds and have found that a series of challenges must still be addressed to bring this combination closer to commercial maturity. “We are examining the feasibility of employing radiative cooling to reduce PV panel temperature and thus increase PV power generation,” the author Dr. Tao Ma, told pv magazine. “On the other hand, radiative cooling could also be used for other solar energy systems, such as solar thermal installations or concentrated solar (CPV) systems.”
Dr. Ma also explained that the cost of a radiative cooling system was not considered in the study.” But generally, it is very cheap, and some scientists are developing some radiative materials with low price and high performance.”
In the paper A review on the integration of radiative cooling and solar energy harvesting, published in materialstoday Energy, Dr. Ma and his colleagues explained that, compared to conventional cooling techniques, radiative cooling is more environmentally friendly as it does not dump the waste heat into the atmospheric air or local water bodies, and, as a passive technique, does not take require any input energy.
“It can be observed that individual RC systems and solar energy systems, both undergo similar challenges in terms of insufficient output energy gain, economic issues, and limited working time,” the Chinese group explained. “It would be of particular interest if the functioning of individual systems could be integrated into a combined system that could provide enhanced output energy and function during both day and night.” Under this configuration, the two systems would not only become able to produce a higher energy gain per unit area but also increase their respective useful working time.
In their review, the academics analysed all studies that investigated the combination of the two systems from different perspectives and identified five major system typologies based on functionality and working time. They also analysed the possibility of replacing the modules’ glass cover with highly emissive RC materials and different types of materials including nanoparticle-based polymers, multilayered film stacks, and micro/nanopatterned structures.
“Solar energy and radiative cooling systems have great potential and promising applications, but the major challenges to large-scale development include low cooling power and heat transfer, non-uniform operating conditions, and variation in supply and demand,” the scientists stated.
RSC occurs when the surface of an object absorbs less radiation from the atmosphere and emits more. As a result, the surface loses heat to the outer space and a cooling effect can be achieved without the need for power.
Radiative cooling was recently applied to solar panel cooling by researchers from the Purdue University in the United States, the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales in Spain, and the Jordan University of Science and Technology and the Australian College of Kuwait.
