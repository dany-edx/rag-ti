It is proposing to lift and release ultra heavy weights in legacy mine shafts, its reimagining of how the universal force of attraction, gravity, can be used to store renewable energy.
In all likelihood, this isn’t the first you’re hearing of gravitational energy storage, but Green Gravity’s founder and CEO Mark Swinnerton is adamant his company has distinct merits, many of which stem from the fact its concept is rooted in redeploying abandoned but very abundant infrastructure, lowering both the capital and environmental outlay of the projects.

In recent weeks, Green Gravity completed its first formal capital raise from a range of private investors, which saw it secure $1.4 million “with plenty of surplus interest,” Swinnerton told pv magazine Australia.
“We are working toward a larger raise in a few months time when we firm up the capital cost for the demonstration plant,” Swinnerton said, adding that he has been engaging with bigger funds and received strong interest. (Energy Vault attracted investment from Leonardo DiCaprio, among other big names.)
Green Gravity’s new staff, which include Phil Moody, Origin’s former Chief of Transformation, have also began studies of the company’s supply chain and manufacturing footprint design. Something Swinnerton, who spent almost two decades at mining giant BHP, insists will be far more simple than other storage solutions with minimal inputs and low levels of processing.
“We don’t have to go and mine the lithium, or process it with new systems, we don’t have the recycle the chemicals because we don’t have any chemicals,” Swinnerton said.
“People ask sometimes, ‘why suddenly are you able to find something so simple and yet it’s an open market?’ and my answer is, ‘it’s really because it’s never been needed before.’” 
“The only reason it’s needed now is because renewable penetration has increased past an inflection point where now all of a sudden natural hedging doesn’t work in the market, you need more storage assets.”
Green Gravity’s technology is flexible in two keys ways, according to Swinnerton. “The first one is the power of the system is associated with how fast we move the weights through the mine shafts. Of course a motor can go at different speeds, therefore we can elect to change the duration and ratings of that dynamically, if we need to.”
“Which is unusual – most energy systems can’t change their duration dynamically,” Swinnerton said.

How the company plans to be do this is using advanced software and artificial intelligence (AI). 
“What we’re going to be doing is move multiple objects around without being able to see them. So the AI is going to be able to help improve the responsiveness of the sensing systems, to be able to learn how to optimise the movement, and how to better respond to the needs of electricity grid in real time to be able to learn how to make our system match and support the grid,” Swinnerton said.
“We’re looking at models that can provide inertia potentially, we’re looking at models which can certainly play in the grid stability and the variety of frequency and voltage markets.”
“We’re also designed to have multiple durations and we think these deep mine shafts [which can be double the height of the Sydney tower in depth] have a real opportunity for mid or long duration storage.”
Green Gravity is ultimately seeking to bring a range of storage products to market. The first, Swinnerton said, will offer between two to three hours of duration, but he says there’s potential for shorter duration which focuses on grid support as well as a long duration model.
The second realm where Green Gravity can offer flexibility, Swinnerton says, comes back to the infrastructure it will be using. “Because we can use infrastructure that is already there, we can get a very low cost footprint.”
“We can attach the capacity in at similar unit costs to pumped hydro, but for a lot less capital.”

“So you don’t have to pay $700 million dollars like you do in some of the big pumped schemes. You just say, ‘well, we’ll pay $30 million’. You’ll get less energy, but you’ll get a similar unit cost outcome to the pumped hydro and there’s lots of them.” 
That is to say, Green Gravity isn’t seeking to do one big project, but rather lots of littler ones – a model which lowers risks and affords greater financing flexibility.
Which brings us to another important facet of the proposition: Australia is littered with mine shafts. “Australia’s mining history was everywhere,” Swinnerton said.
The company has discovered at least 3 GWh of potential storage capacity from the 175 sites it has assessed and found to be suitable. “I can guarantee you unequivocally that there is more than that available – and that’s just in Australia.”
“There are many, many gigawatt hours that are up for grabs in the rest of the world that Australia should be looking at.”
Swinnerton thinks the Green Gravity’s concept will also offer legacy mine sites a valuable exchange, providing them with an income stream to fund their rehabilitation.
Again, this is a fairly straightforward concept: Green Gravity would come in and reuse the site’s shafts and possibly other infrastructure, providing mines which are no longer selling product with a constant trickle of cash to restore the sites. This would be especially useful for mine sites owned by government, for which taxpayers need to foot the rehab bill.
This weekend’s ‘greenslide’ election, coupled with the ongoing fight to secure battery materials has only boosted Green Gravity’s prospects, according to Swinnerton. “I think there is a real chance of an acceleration and am certainly keen to engage with the incoming government around this point,” he said.
The company is also in the final stages of settling a significant operating partnership, with an announcement anticipated in the coming weeks.

A research group from Singapore has offered to reuse silicon from end-of-life photovoltaics in high-performance thermoelectric devices that convert heat into electricity.
“Our method can be applied to all silicon-based solar panels,” researcher Ady Suwardi told pv magazine.
The scientists said thermoelectric devices are very tolerant to defects and impurities, which makes them particularly suitable for recycled silicon, which is uneconomical to recycle due to its defect- and impurity-sensitive nature.
Their new technique consists of pulverising polycrystalline silicon into powder and pelletising it into ingots. The process relies on spark plasma sintering to dope the silicon with germanium and phosphorus. The combination of doping and reduced thermal conductivity is designed to improve the power conversion and cooling efficiency of applicable thermoelectric technologies.
The researchers tested their technique on 15.6 cm x 15.6 cm solar cells provided by Singaporean manufacturer Green Research Scientific.
“The silicon pieces were pulverised using ball milling into fine powder,” they said, noting that the ball milling is done for an hour in argon atmosphere to ensure homogeneity and prevent oxidation. “Subsequently, the mixed powders were consolidated using spark plasma sintering at 1,150 C for five minutes.”
The group found that phosphorus doping modified the electronic structure of the silicon, while improving its power factor and carrier scattering. Germanium doping helped further improve both the electronic and thermal transport properties of the upcycled silicon.
“Furthermore, the recycled silicon with low germanium content in this work is expected to have good stability since silicon-based thermoelectrics such as Silicon-germanium (SiGe) have been widely known to have good mechanical and chemical stability during long-term, high-temperature operation,” they said. “This results in attractive energy harvested/dollar ratio compared to conventional thermoelectrics that mainly rely on heavy elements.”
The academics presented their findings in “Upcycling Silicon Photovoltaic Waste into Thermoelectrics,” which was recently published in Advanced Materials. The research group includes scientists from the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research.
“At this point, it is difficult to estimate the cost of our recycling technology as it depends on many external factors such as scale, supply, labor, technology, and so on,” Suwardi said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/25/gallium-doping-and-solar-cell-degradation/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"MAY 25, 2022",Gallium doping and solar cell degradation,"From pv magazine Global
Silicon PV cell manufacturers have been quick to adopt gallium doping, as it offers a solution to the light-induced degradation phenomenon caused by interactions between oxygen and the boron that was until recently the more common choice for dopant material.
The rapid switch to gallium, however, raises further questions about how gallium will interact with other materials present in the cell and other module components, and how other known degradation mechanisms such as light-elevated temperature induced degradation (LETID) might be affected.
This was the focus for researchers led by Germany’s Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH). They fabricated gallium doped silicon solar cells and subjected them to one-sun illumination at a variety of different temperatures, to better understand how their long-term performance might be affected in the field.
The experiments, in which cells were illuminated while placed on a hotplate at temperatures between 80 C and 160 C for up to 1,400 hours, revealed LETID-related degradation, though to a much lesser extent than in most boron-doped PV cells. The effect is described in full in “Light and elevated temperature induced degradation and recovery of gallium-doped Czochralski-silicon solar cells,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports.
The group found that those cells exposed to higher temperatures lost the most performance – from absolute efficiency losses of 0.15% in a cell left at 80 C, to 0.4% for one at 140 C.
“The activation of a bulk defect is responsible for the observed LeTID effect on the Ga-doped Cz-Si solar cells,” the researchers said. “In our recent lifetime study we ascribed this effect to hydrogen, which diffuses into the silicon bulk during the firing step.”
Once they had reached maximum degradation, cells were placed under lower conditions of 0.5 sun illumination and a temperature of 44 C, which was shown to begin a temporary regeneration cycle after just 15 minutes, and when exposed again to higher temperatures this improved even further.
The group was able to demonstrate regeneration to 0.2% (absolute) more than the cell’s initial efficiency, after around five hours exposed to one-sun illumination at 140 C. This was also shown to partly deactivate the defect causing the losses, and in subsequent testing the LETID losses to the cells were almost halved.
“Stable solar cell efficiencies above 22% were measured after regeneration,” the group concluded. “Meaning that within the uncertainty range of the efficiency measurement, the developed cells on Ga-doped Cz-Si can be classified ‘long-term stable’ after regeneration.”
