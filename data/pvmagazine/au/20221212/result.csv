Engineering, procurement, and construction contractor Gransolar has already commenced early works at the project sites but Lightsource bp said it will now issue full notice to proceed on both projects, which are expected to be completed in 2024.
Financing for the projects was secured from ANZ, ING, Mizuho, NORD/LB and Westpac. The debt package has been structured as a green financing loan – where the funding is earmarked by lenders for new projects that create positive environmental outcomes.
Lightsource bp also entered into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Australian building manufacturing and supply company Boral. The agreement is in addition to existing offtake deals with electricity retailer Engie and industry heavyweights Orica and Mars Australia.

Lightsource bp’s Managing Director for Australia and New Zealand, Adam Pegg, said reaching financial close on the projects is a testament to the strength and resilience of the company.
“This is a fantastic achievement from the Lightsource bp team, and I’m grateful for the strong support from our customers, the local communities in which we operate, and these lenders,” he said. “This milestone now sees Lightsource bp become the leading solar developer and owner in Australia on a MW basis.”
Pegg said Lightsource bp has reached financial close and construction on more than 1 GWdc of PV capacity in Australia since establishing a presence in 2018.
Lightsource BP, which announced in 2021 that it plans to reach 25 GW of solar project capacity by 2025, has nominated Australia as one of its key markets and now has five projects in operation and under construction across NSW, Queensland, and Victoria.

The Energy Corporation of NSW (EnergyCo), which has been tasked with implementing the government’s REZs, has confirmed that the Hunter-Central Coast REZ has been formally declared, paving the way for a huge pipeline of large-scale renewable energy generation and storage projects to come online.
The declaration is the first step in formalising the REZ under the Electricity Infrastructure Investment Act 2020. It sets out the intended size, location and infrastructure that will make up the Hunter-Central Coast REZ which includes areas of the Upper Hunter, Muswellbrook, Singleton, Dungog, Cessnock, Maitland, Port Stephens, Newcastle, Lake Macquarie and the Central Coast.
EnergyCo Executive Director Mike Young said the newly declared REZ is a resource-rich region offering great renewable energy resources, with significant port and transport infrastructure, a skilled workforce and the capability to repurpose existing power stations and rehabilitated mining land.
“The Hunter-Central Coast REZ will ensure these regions play a key role in a renewable energy future, powering existing industries and supporting economic growth including emerging technology in green hydrogen, ammonia and metal production, offshore wind, electric vehicle fleet operators as well as electrification of industrial processes,” he said.

An initial expressions of interest process for the Hunter-Central Coast REZ attracted almost 40 GW of large-scale solar, wind and hydro generation and energy storage projects, which collectively would deliver more than 100,000 GWh of renewable energy a year and represents more than $100 billion (USD 67.6 billion) of potential investment.
The state received commercial interest to develop 24 large-scale solar projects, 35 utility-scale battery energy storage systems and eight pumped hydro projects in the Hunter-Central Coast REZ. Investors have also proposed 13 onshore and seven offshore wind energy projects.
Energy Minister Matt Kean said at the time that the overwhelming result shows the Hunter and Central Coast, home to four of NSW’s five coal-fired power stations, will continue to serve as the state’s energy powerhouse long into the future.
“These results show that energy investors see the Hunter and Central Coast as some of the best investment destinations anywhere in the country, which will translate into jobs and prosperity for the region,” he said.
EnergyCo, which will oversee the coordination of transmission, generation, firming and storage projects within the Hunter-Central Coast REZ, said it will continue to engage closely with industry, local government, local communities and other stakeholders as it progresses the design and delivery of the REZ.
The formal declaration of the Hunter-Central Coast REZ comes after the declarations for the Central-West Orana, New England and South-West zones which have attracted a combined 95 GW of interest. A REZ will also be developed in the Illawarra region.
The zones, are a key part of the NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap which the state has adopted as it looks to systematically transition from coal-fired power generation to renewables-based electricity.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/12/unsw-researchers-patent-low-cost-additive-to-solve-perovskites-stability-problem-after-achieving-world-class-results/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"DECEMBER 12, 2022",UNSW researchers patent low-cost additive to solve perovskite’s stability problem after achieving world-class results,"The culmination of three years of work, researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) have discovered a low-cost sulphur-based additive that can boost the stability of perovskite solar cells without compromising efficiency.
The additive, known as 1-DDT (Dodecanethiol), has a “multifunction” – something which came as a surprise to the UNSW School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering team. On top of stabilising the lithium used in the hole transport layer of perovskite cells to achieve high efficiencies, the additive also induces oxidation and prevents water ingression – both features which add to stability. 
“This 1-DDT locks lithium in that layer, and I think thats a major contribution and a major underlying mechanism to make this stable,” research lead Professor Xiaojing Hao tells pv magazine Australia.
Costing just $0.049 (0.033 USD) per gram, the additive doesn’t take away from perovskites promise of cheap manufacturability. 
Perovskite cells fabricated using this novel additive were able to maintain more than 90% of the initial efficiency after operating at maximum power point under one sun illumination for 1,000 hours, and more than 93% of the initial efficiency after staying at open circuit condition under one sun illumination for 2,000 hours. This reported stability result is the best in Australia and among the highest in the world.
The results of the research have now been published in Nature Photonics and have been co-authored by Professor Martin Green, famously known as the ‘father’ of modern solar cells, with Xu Liu lead author.

While perovskites’ high efficiencies are proven, “everyone still has concerns in terms of long term stability,” Professor Hao says.
Historically, perovskite cells have had a tradeoff between high efficiency and good stability because of something known as the hole transport layer. One of the most widely used materials used in perovskites’ hole transport layer is Spiro-OMeTAD. 
Spiro, as Professor Hao calls it, is behind all record-setting perovskite cells which have achieved efficiencies beyond 25%.
While Spiro is excellent for efficiency, it typically requires chemical doping with a lithium compound – something the UNSW team found decreases cell stability. “Lithium causes the stability issue,” Professor Hao says, but it is also the “secret recipe” which gives the layer its desirable electrical properties.

After identifying that Spiro’s issues start with its lithium salt doping prerequisite, the UNSW team set about finding a way to “lock” the lithium in the layer. Inspired by research into lithium-sulfide batteries which found the combination of lithium and sulphur makes stable compounds, the team began experimenting with sulphur-based chemicals.
“But we didn’t expect it also would generate something that would make it an oxidation agent as well. So that was some surprise to us,” Professor Hao says.
The 1-DDT additive was discovered to have a “triple function” – alongside locking lithium in the Spiro layer, it induces a critical process of oxidation. The oxidation process 1-DDT induces is both fast and controllable, eliminating the necessity of a usually days-long process. This feature, the UNSW team says, is important for the high-throughput production of perovskite cells towards commercialisation.
On top of this, the 1-DDT additive also turns the Spiro layer from hydrophilic, meaning it is highly absorptive of moistures, to being hydrophobic, making it resistant to water ingression and ultimately improving the cell’s moisture stability. These features overall also improve film morphology, lock the mobile dopants, and impede the ion migrations.
This combination contributes to higher perovskite cell efficiency as well as “markedly improved stability” under ambient air, wetting, thermal, and continuous illumination stimuli, the UNSW teams says.
The UNSW team currently have a provisional patent for the 1-DDT additive, with Professor Hao saying next the team want to set a record efficiency with their cells. They are also hoping to soon get their stability results verified under combined temperature and illumination tests.
“What we want is [those stability results] combined and ideally, final case, a real world stability test,” she says. “So that’s a challenging part and thats the work we are doing at the moment.”

The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has awarded Sydney-based Infravision $732,493 to test and trial its line-monitoring technology which is to be deployed on selected transmission lines in Transgrid’s network in New South Wales (NSW).
Infravision’s line-monitoring system consists of a sensor stack that can be installed by drone on transmission lines to provide real-time information about environmental factors such as wind and high temperatures, and any sagging of conductors, which can affect capacity.
Transgrid Executive General Manager of Network Marie Jordan said the data collected by the sensors can be used to calculate a dynamic line rating (DLR) that provides a more accurate and responsive measurement of transmission capacity, allowing higher volumes of electricity to be safely dispatched when conditions are suitable.
“This is clever technology which provides real-time data we can use to ensure transmission lines are operating as effectively as possible for consumers,” she said. “This system enables us to receive data in real time which can be used to calculate a dynamic line rating to determine if more electricity can be dispatched along a line in favourable conditions when it’s safe to do so.”

Currently, most transmission operators use static line ratings, which make assumptions to ensure lines can always operate safely, without knowledge of actual environmental conditions affecting the line.
By calculating DLR using real-time, real-world conditions, Jordan said transmission operators will be able to determine when it is safe to dispatch higher volumes of electricity on existing infrastructure.
“Increasing capacity by maximising existing infrastructure means we can optimise our existing assets with real-time information and support the transition to renewable energy,” she said.
ARENA Chief Executive Offcier Darren Miller said Infravision’s technology has the potential to reduce the need for new transmission infrastructure and help accelerate the electricity transition.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has, in the 2022 Integrated System Plan, identified $12.7 billion of new transmission projects required to underpin the transition to renewable energy over the next decade.
“The electricity transition is going to require new generation and transmission on a massive scale. Infravision’s integrated dynamic line rating solution can help get the most out of existing transmission lines,” Miller said.
“Allowing an increased flow of electricity through existing assets reduces the need for new infrastructure, keeping down costs for consumers and network operators.”
Infravision said it is continuing to develop its line monitoring system and expects to install the first sensor units later this year. Transgrid said the sensors will be in place for a 12-month evaluation period during which it will assess a potential grid-scale rollout of the technology.

Ausgrid has installed community batteries at three sites as part of a two-year trial which will allow the network operator to shift the way solar power is being utilised in New South Wales (NSW), ultimately allowing for more renewables on the grid, while also decreasing costs for consumers and stabilising local grids.
Batteries have been installed in the Sydney suburbs of Beacon Hill and Bankstown and at Cameron Park near Lake Macquarie in the Hunter region. Ausgrid is testing two different energy storage systems as part of the trial, including two Tesla PowerPack 2 batteries, which each deliver up to 130 kW of power and 232 kWh of storage, and a MTU Energy Pack QS which provides about 150 kW / 267 kWh of storage capacity.
Ausgrid said since the batteries were installed, they have been soaking up consumer-generated solar with customers benefiting from the virtual storage service, earning credits for renewable energy exported to the battery in the daytime and consumed from the battery when the sun goes down.
At the same time, Ausgrid has been testing the ability of the batteries to manage grid voltage and add further power capacity in areas with high solar penetration.
The agreement with Simply Energy, the retail branch of French energy giant Engie, will extend the benefits of the community batteries beyond just the trial participants to customers across the grid.
When not needed for network support, battery capacity will be made available to Simply Energy which will operate the batteries in the National Electricity Markey (NEM) in a move which Ausgrid expects will help to support the continued growth of renewable energy.

Simply Energy said a key part of the trial is to test how the three Ausgrid batteries can be used to ‘value stack’ by offering unutilised battery system capacity to a market partner for use in wholesale and frequency control markets.
Simply Energy Solutions General Manager Ryan Wavish said the company also aims to access additional value from the energy market by incorporating the community batteries into its existing Virtual Power Plant, which includes customers’ home batteries.
“We are excited … to explore the benefits of community batteries and their ability to provide valuable network services as well as generate returns through energy and ancillary services markets” Wavish said. “These assets will form an important part of our growing Virtual Power Plant fleet”.
Ausgrid Chief Customer Officer Rob Amphlett Lewis said the agreement is expected to provide crucial insights into how community batteries can be used by market partners and the potential value that could be unlocked in future projects.
“The ability to have community batteries participate in the energy market is the final piece of the puzzle for our trial and one that really demonstrates how the industry can work together to provide the storage services that are urgently needed to meet our net-zero goals,” he said.
“These batteries are secure and sophisticated enough to provide valuable market services while located to provide optimal customer benefits.”
Ausgrid’s community battery trial across the three locations is due to continue until the end of 2023.

Rise Fire Research, an institute in Norway, has conducted a series of experiments indicating that the distance between solar modules and rooftop surfaces could be a crucial factor in PV system fires.
“We have not found any single ideal distance between the roof and the PV modules that can prevent fire propagation,” researcher Ragni Fjellgaard Mikalsen told pv magazine. “But we have seen that the gap distance is one of several parameters that affect the fire spread.”
The scientists said that wind speed and air gap size could affect the development of fires in the space between solar modules and the underlying roof structures. They also looked at how fires could affect PV systems on real, pitched rooftops in Norway. They performed 29 experiments at the institute’s facility in Trondheim in 2021.
The research group identified a link between the size of the gap between a rooftop surface and the modules, and determined how big an initial fire would have to be for the blaze to spread and become larger. 
“These, and other experiments, point to that a larger gap distance decreases the flame propagation, but other parameters, like inclination, ignition source, combustible materials can also affect the fire dynamics in the air gap,” Fjellgaard Mikalsen said.
Fjellgaard Mikalsen claimed that there are no testing methods or standards that properly consider the interplay between PV modules and building surfaces.
“The test methods for building materials are not including the possibility to add PV modules, and the test methods for PV modules are not considering what building surface they should be installed on,” she said. “For building integrated PV modules, the modules need to comply with both the regulations for building materials and as an electrical installation.”
Fjellgaard Mikalsen said the modules were tested against one of the four European test methods listed in CEN/TS 1187, but noted that these test methods are not particularly well suited to test PV modules.
“The American test standard UL 1703 / UL 61730 includes some fire tests where the combination of roofing material and PV installation is handled,” she said. “These are based on the test for roofing materials UL 790 where the roof is exposed to an external flame.”
The scientists said that future standards for Norwegian PV installations should be harmonised on a European level, and preferably globally.
“Ideally, the test standards should consider the interactions between the building surface and the PV modules and test the systems at a sufficiently large scale to include the important details of the building surface, fixing system and PV modules,” Fjellgaard Mikalsen said. “To be able to document the fire performance of different combinations of roofing materials, fixing systems and PV modules, a structured classification scheme could be developed.
A similar study, published by the University of Edinburgh and the Technical University of Denmark, showed similar results. The scientists analysed fire dynamics and flame spread on the substrate beneath panels. They concluded that the shorter the distance between the panels and rooftop, the higher the probability of larger and more destructive fires.
