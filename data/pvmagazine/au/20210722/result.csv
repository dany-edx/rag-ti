AVL managing director Vincent Algar said the matched-funding grant will also allow the company to finalise its high-purity vanadium pentoxide processing route as part of the development of its Australian Vanadium Project located in the Murchison province in WA.
AVL plans to supply vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) from the Australian Vanadium Project to manufacture vanadium electrolyte which will then be supplied to VRFB projects in Australia and in the Asia Pacific Region.
“The grant will provide support to AVL to achieve production of high-purity vanadium pentoxide, which is a key input to vanadium-titanium master alloys for critical steel applications and vanadium electrolyte for batteries,” Algar said.
“In turn this will assist development of the project, with the company now in discussion with offtakers for vanadium electrolyte in addition to vanadium pentoxide.
“The grant will allow AVL to produce vanadium electrolyte commercially to support the development of the long-duration energy storage market, which will play a key role in future grid stability in this renewable energy generation era.”
AVL said the electrolyte plant will be the first plant of its type in the region. Conditions of the grant dictate the manufacturing project must be fully completed by March 31, 2024.

Flow batteries are emerging as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries which currently dominate the energy storage sector.
Lithium-ion batteries are solid-state batteries, storing energy in metal, whereas flow batteries store energy in electrolyte liquids. They usually comprise two tanks, one containing a positively-charged anode and the other with a negatively-charged cathode, separated by a membrane.
Supporters of the technology claim using liquids allows flow batteries to produce electrical currents without degradation, giving the batteries a longer cycle life and allowing them to store charge for longer periods compared to lithium-ion batteries. It also makes them non-flammable and well-suited to Australian conditions.
Algar said the appeal of VFRB is clear, declaring them ideal for providing long-duration energy storage, from three to 12 hours, while vanadium electrolyte – which accounts for 30% to 60% of the cost of the battery, depending on how many hours of storage are required – can be leased to reduce capital cost and can be 100% reused or recycled at the end of the battery’s mechanical life
“VRFB battery systems are easier to manufacture than other batteries, due to the use of only a single metal component, vanadium, to store the energy,” Algar said.
“They are ideal for accelerating battery manufacturing in Australia, using locally produced vanadium and other battery components.”

AVL is one of eight companies in the resources technology and critical minerals sectors awarded a matched-funding grant under the Australian Government’s Resources Technology and Critical Minerals Processing National Manufacturing Priority roadmap.
Minister of Industry Science and Technology Christian Porter on Thursday announced almost $50 million had been allocated to the eight companies as part of the $1.3 billion Modern Manufacturing Initiative.
“Australia’s resource sector is world-class,” he said. “We are helping to unlock this enormous potential by providing targeted support for projects that will deliver big rewards for our local economy in terms of export earnings and new job opportunities.
“It is also critical that we build our sovereign capability in this sector, with China currently the world leader in critical minerals processing including battery production.”
“Whether it’s building large-scale battery systems, adding value to critical minerals exports through new refining techniques, or driving the adoption of battery power in mining vehicles, these projects will increase Australia’s international competitiveness and help position us a future leader in this crucial sector.”
Other recipients include New South Wales-based Batt Mobile Equipment which received $4.5 million in funding to build heavy battery electric vehicles (EVs) for underground hard rock mines.
Lynas Rare Earths will use its $14.8 million in funding to develop a world-first process to refine rare earth ore – essential for permanent magnet and EV production. The new refining process reduces the need for hazardous chemicals and delivers a significantly higher-grade product for export. The project will be based in WA’s Goldfields region.
Elphinstone in Tasmania will receive $5.1 million in funding to develop a range of battery-powered underground mining support vehicles that eliminate the need for diesel use in underground environments.
In the Northern Territory, Core Lithium will use its $6 million in funding to help build a pilot processing facility for the production of battery-grade lithium hydroxide while Queensland-based Brisbane METS Lab No. 1 will use its $1.2 million to develop its vanadium processing pilot plant.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/22/fossil-fuel-subsidies-labelled-reckless-as-renewables-hit-new-highs/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 22, 2021",Fossil fuel subsidies labelled ‘reckless’ as renewables hit new highs,"Data provided by the Climate Council reveals that energy generated by renewables including wind and solar PV increased by almost 20% in the National Energy Market (NEM) in the first half of 2021.
Renewable energy generation in the NEM climbed to 28.8% overall in the first six months of the year, with Tasmania leading the way with 99.6% of its energy needs delivered by renewables.
South Australia had 62.8% of its electricity provided by renewable energy generators while renewables accounted for 28.7% of Victoria’s electricity needs and New South Wales’ green energy intake increased by 35% to 22.8%. Renewables provided 16.8% of Queensland electricity.
Western Australia, which is not part of the NEM, also enjoyed a significant increase in renewable energy generation in the South-West Interconnected System (SWIS), up 41% to 30.1%.
Climate Council spokesman and former BP Australasia president Greg Bourne said the figures coincided with a slump in gas demand, proving once again that the federal government’s gas-fired strategy is ill founded.
With renewable energy on the rise between the first half of 2020 and the first half of 2021, gas generation fell in every state in Australia, providing just 6% of power in the NEM.
“Gas simply cannot compete with renewable energy, which is bringing down power prices for consumers and creating a cleaner, healthier energy system,” Bourne said.

Of the NEM’s 33 large-scale gas power stations, the Climate Council said 29 of them operated at less than 20% of their capacity during the past 12 months and 13 operated less than 5% of the time.
Bourne said the figures made a mockery of the Morrison Government’s continued support for gas, including the recently announced plans to develop a 660 MW open-cycle gas power station with diesel back-up near Kurri Kurri in NSW.
“Gas will play an ever-decreasing role in the new energy economy,” he said.
“Should the federal government force gas into the market by underwriting the risks, it is likely to drive up household power prices and prices for our manufacturing.
“Every taxpayer dollar spent on new gas-fired power infrastructure is at risk of being wasted on unnecessary stranded assets.”
Bourne said the International Energy Agency (IEA) had made it clear that in order to meet net zero emissions by 2050 globally, no new fossil fuels reserves can be developed.
“The government needs to acknowledge this advice and acknowledge the fact that the NSW Kurri Kurri gas power station is not required in our future energy mix,” he said.
The Climate Council’s criticism of the government’s approach coincides with the release of a report by BloombergNEF and Bloomberg Philanthropies which reveals Australia’s level of support for fossil fuel companies increased by 48% between 2015 and 2019, more than any other country in the G20.
Authors of the Climate Policy Factbook say the bulk of that support has gone to oil and gas consumers in the form of capex tax deductions for mining and petroleum operations, fuel tax credits, reduced fuel excise rates and offset schemes.
The report indicates Australia spent US$38 billion in supporting the oil and gas sector between 2015 and 2019, foregoing some US$6 billion in taxes.
Image: BloombergNEF
Australia’s spend is part of a combined ~US$3.3 trillion spent by the G20 countries supporting the fossil fuel sector.
BloombergNEF said the level of fossil fuel support from the world’s 20 biggest economies will make it impossible to achieve the Paris Agreement targets and limit global warming to well below 2C on pre-industrial levels by 2050.
Antha Williams, the environment lead at Bloomberg Philanthropies, said the backing for coal, oil and gas is “reckless” in the face of the escalating climate emergency, and urgent action is needed to phase out the support.
“As a host of climate emergencies intensify around the world, the continued development of fossil fuel infrastructure is nothing short of reckless,” she said.
“We need more than just words, we need action.”
The Bloomberg factbook highlights three areas where immediate action is needed to limit global warming to 1.5C: ending fossil fuel subsidies, putting a price on carbon emissions and making companies disclose the risks posed by climate change to their businesses.
“Given that the G20 accounts for nearly three-quarters of global emissions, progress from those governments in these three areas would mark a huge step forward toward tacking climate change,” said Victoria Cuming, head of global policy at BloombergNEF and lead author of the factbook.
“So far, they have yet to step up to the plate.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/22/wollongong-uni-to-host-renewable-energy-focused-training-centre/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 22, 2021",Wollongong Uni to host renewable energy focused training centre,"The University of Wollongong (UOW) on the New South Wales south coast will be home to the Australian Research Council (ARC) Training Centre in Energy Technologies for Future Grids which it says will advance Australia’s transition to a clean energy future and help deliver the next generation of renewable energy industry leaders and specialists.
UOW deputy vice-chancellor Professor Jennifer Martin said the training facility, included in a  $74 million dollar funding package announced by the federal government this week, will help deliver world-class industry-linked research into renewable energy and boost Australia’s transition to a clean energy future.
“The new training centre will deliver solutions to complex issues that create barriers to Australia’s transition to a clean energy future which is sustainable, cost effective and environmentally friendly,” Martin said.
Australia’s uptake of renewable energy is almost double the global average but the nation’s ageing infrastructure has been struggling to keep pace with the rapid transition and electricity networks and market operators have increasingly been constraining variable assets like rooftop solar, wind farms and utility-scale solar farms.
Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) chief executive Daniel Westerman earlier this month declared the nation’s energy system needs to evolve to keep pace with the transition, saying the grid needs to be ready for instances of 100% renewables by 2025 to end asset constraints.
“I’m not saying Australia is going to run at 100% renewable energy for the entire year of 2025, nor am I asking for policy intervention or otherwise,” he said.
“The goal for us at AEMO is to harness the talents, capabilities, and experience across the industry, to engineer grids that are capable of running at 100% instantaneous penetration of renewable energy by 2025,” he said.

Professor Kashem Muttaqi, from the School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering and Information Sciences, will head the new UOW training centre and said it will look to address some of those issues currently confronting the energy sector.
“The training centre will address the complex and challenging issues currently limiting the growth of renewable energy through innovations that facilitate widespread integration of these resources into electricity grids while maintaining grid stability,” he said.
“It will advance Australia’s transition to a clean energy future and will deliver the next generation of industry leaders and specialists in future grid technologies for renewable energy generation, transmission and distribution.
“Supported by renewable hydrogen energy storage and market-driven customer responsiveness enabled by new information and communications technologies, this will provide a more sustainable, reliable, secure and affordable electricity system.”
The UOW training centre is one of 16 new research hubs and training centres set to be established around the country after the federal government this week announced a $74 million funding package as part of its commitment to commercialising Australian research under its Industrial Transformation Research Program (ITRP).
The program will provide $36.4 million for the establishment of eight new research hubs and $37.8 million will see eight new training centres commence operations.

Minister for Education and Youth Alan Tudge said the projects will create stronger research and industry connections in areas including energy, biomedical technology and agriculture.
“These facilities will bring together our finest research minds and leading businesses to tackle the key strategic challenges facing our nation, our region and the world,” he said.
“They will ensure we are getting the most out of our world-class research while transferring that information into real-world outcomes.
“The training centres will also equip our future generation of researchers by giving students and postdoctoral researchers practical skills and experience through industry placements.”
The University of New South Wales is another of the facilities to secure funding under the program with $4.98 million allocated to establish the ARC Research Hub for Resilient and Intelligent Infrastructure Systems (RIIS) in Urban, Resources and Energy Sectors.
To be led by Professor Nasser Khalili, the hub will integrate sensor technology, connectivity, data analytics, machine learning, robotics, smart materials, and reliable models.
“A frontier arena of research, the hub will provide a fully integrated platform for the development and delivery of next-generation digital technologies for Australia’s infrastructure,” Khalili said.
“The technologies will enable design, real-time performance analysis and life-management of infrastructure.
“The hub will solve industry challenges and translate research and development into commercial opportunities and outcomes.”
The unveiling of the new training centres and research hubs comes just days after the Australian National University in Canberra opened its Distributed Energy Resources Lab, dedicated to researching and testing technologies including batteries, solar panels and electric vehicles which it says will “underpin the energy grids of the future”.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/22/think-tank-puts-end-date-on-sale-of-petrol-and-diesel-cars-in-australia/,"EV,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 22, 2021",Think tank puts end date on sale of petrol and diesel cars in Australia,"Public policy think tank the Grattan Institute has turned its attention to Australia’s transport sector, declaring state and federal governments must step up their regulatory efforts to help fast track the introduction of electric vehicles (EVs) if the nation is to have any chance of reaching net zero emissions by 2050.
In a new report, the institute has called for Australian governments to introduce policies to limit the effects of the transport sector which it says was responsible for almost 20% of Australia’s emissions in 2020.
The Towards Net Zero report, authored by Tony Wood, Alison Reeve and James Ha, calls for governments to make zero-emissions vehicles cheaper and make it easier for drivers to charge their EVs at home, at work, and on the road and also recommends abolishing import duty to give Australians access to a greater range of EVs.
The report also recommends the phasing out of all petrol and diesel cars, saying the federal government should impose a mandatory emissions limit on Australia’s light vehicle fleet and reduce the limit to zero by 2035.
“The best policy would be an economy-wide emissions price,” the report reads. “But we need to accept the regrettable reality that neither side of Australian politics is going to introduce an emissions price any time soon.
“So the best way to cut transport emissions is to supercharge the switch to electric cars.”

Figures provided by the institute show annual emissions from transport grew from 82 million tonnes in 2005 to 101 million tonnes in 2019. Emissions dropped by 7 million tonnes in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the federal government predicts they will rebound and reach 100 million tonnes by 2030.
“The best way to cut transport emissions is to switch to zero-emissions vehicles, mainly battery EVs, in the light vehicle fleet,” the report says.
“The range, performance, upfront price, and total ownership costs of zero-emissions vehicles are rapidly improving. But relying on technology and market forces alone won’t be enough to get on track for net zero by 2050.
“Australian governments can and should act now to create momentum towards the net-zero goal.”
The institute said Australia needs a national fleet emissions standard for new passenger and light commercial vehicles, and the standard should tighten to zero emissions by 2035.
“This would signal an end date for the sale of new petrol and diesel light vehicles, consistent with other major economies and with International Energy Agency advice,” the authors wrote.
“And it would encourage car manufacturers to supply low- and zero-emissions vehicles that meet Australian consumers’ range and performance demands.”
EVs made up just 0.7% of new car sales in Australia in 2020, compared to 3% in New Zealand, 11% in the UK, and 75% in Norway.
The report recommends governments encourage a thriving market for zero-emissions vehicles by exempting them from “inefficient taxes” such as import duties, luxury car tax, and motor vehicle stamp duty.

They should also ensure drivers across the country have somewhere to charge EVs, calling for a change to construction codes to require all new buildings with off-street parking to include electrical cabling to allow for an appropriate number of future EV chargers; require all leased dwellings with off-street parking to have at least one electrical outlet near the car park by 2030; and ensure convenient, local vehicle charging is available by 2030 for all residents of homes without off-street parking.
The institute also called on governments to use their own fleet purchasing power to encourage better performance from manufacturers.
“Some state governments have already set targets for electric vehicles in their government fleets,” the report says. “Others should follow suit when fleet contracts are next renewed”.
The report also recommends increasing the truck width limit in Australia from 2.5m to 2.6m to ensure any zero-emissions heavy vehicles made for Europe or the United State can be used in Australia without expensive modifications.
The recommendations are included in first of a series of five reports the Grattan Institute plans to publish in the lead-up to the international climate conference in Glasgow in November, showing how Australia can build momentum towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
The other four reports will cover industrial emissions; agriculture and land use; the role of offsets; and the electricity sector.
Over the next decade, Australia’s electricity emissions are projected to fall substantially, but the Grattan Institute expects the next four largest emissions sources in Australia will either grow or plateau at best.
“Australia has suffered more than a decade of policy uncertainty on climate change,” the report says.
“Despite increasing international ambition and increasingly urgent calls for action, political differences between and within major parties have held back progress. Nevertheless, converging international and domestic political pressures have created a window of opportunity for progress on climate change policy.
“Action today is crucial to avoid locking in emissions for decades to come, and to ensure the transport sector contributes to Australia reaching net zero by 2050.”
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said reaching net zero emissions by 2050 is “preferable” but has so far resisted growing international pressure to commit to the target.

Norwegian solar module manufacturer REC, a unit of Chinese chemical company Chemchina, has launched, on Monday, the second generation of its N-Peak solar modules.
The production of the solar modules, based on monocrystalline, half-cut, n-type PERT cells, is expected to start in August at the company’s factory in Singapore. The first shipments to customers are planned for October.
The new product relies on 120 half-cells and has a power output ranging from 360 W to 375 W. The module efficiency is between 19.7 and 20.5%, depending on the output. The solar modules are also claimed to withstand loads of up to 7000 Pascal.
The company specified the module has a size of 1,755×1,044x30mm and a weight of 20kg. The maximum system voltage is indicated at 1000 V. The operating temperature for the solar modules is between -40 and 85 degrees Celsius.
With its twin design, the manufacturer also promises higher yields when the photovoltaic system is shaded. REC grants a 25-year product guarantee on the modules. The performance guarantee provides that the solar modules will still have 92% of their performance in the 25th year of operation.
REC originally launched the N-Peak module in June 2018. At the time, it was the first solar module in the world to combine n-type TOPCon cells with a twin design.

Singaporean solar developer Sunseap has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Batam Indonesia Free Zone Authority (BP Batam) – which is the public authority responsible for the management, development, and construction on the island of Batam in Indonesia – for the construction of a 2.2 GW PV floating project at the Duriangkang Reservoir in the southern part of the region.
If built, the $2 billion project would be the world’s largest floating PV power plant and would reach the same capacity as the largest ground-mounted facility currently in operation, which is a 2.2 GW plant located in China’s Qinghai province.
The facility is planned to occupy a water surface of 1,600ha and to be coupled with a storage system with a capacity of 4,000 MWh.
Sunseap said the Duriangkang Reservoir provides more than 50% of the freshwater supply to Batam Island and that the floating solar panels will help to reduce evaporation, thereby retaining more water within the reservoir. “Simultaneously, the water will keep the solar panels cool, thereby generating more clean energy and creating a synergistic relationship,” it further explained. “Sunseap expects the solar farm to generate more than 2,600 GWh of electricity per annum, potentially offsetting over 1.8 million metric tons of carbon per year.”
“This hyper-scale project is a significant milestone for Sunseap, coming soon after we had completed Singapore’s first offshore floating solar farm along the Straits of Johor,” said Sunseap CEO Frank Phuan. “This investment by Sunseap will be a timely boost for Batam’s industries as they seek to reduce the carbon footprint of their operations. At the same time, it will create jobs and transfer skills to Batam’s clean energy sector,” added BP Batam chairman, Muhammad Rudi.
The project will be financed with both bank borrowings and own funds. Its construction is scheduled to start next year and completion is planned for 2024.

WA joins the Queensland, Victorian and Australian Capital Territory (ACT) governments, the Australian National University (ANU), the German Energy Agency and a growing list of commercial, industrial and scientific partners, including Norwegian chemical company Yara which is already looking to have its green hydrogen and ammonia production and export facility in the Pilbara certified under the Scheme. The McGowan government has already invested $2 million in Yara and Engie Renewables Australia’s YURI Green Ammonia Project. 
Really fantastic to have the WA Government as a Founding Partner in the @SmartEnergyCncl @HydrogenAus Zero Carbon Certification Scheme, joining ACT, Victorian and Queensland Governments and 11 others.
Thank you for your leadership @AlannahMac pic.twitter.com/QcdFS7EMyL
— SmartEnergyCouncil (@SmartEnergyCncl) July 21, 2021

The Scheme was launched by the SEC in January with the aim of providing a guarantee of origin for hydrogen and its derivatives as Australia pursues a leadership role in the evolving hydrogen economy. This was followed last month by the Commonwealth government’s Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources which released a discussion paper on an Australian hydrogen Guarantee of Origin certification scheme (GO scheme) as part of its National Hydrogen Strategy. 
However, considering the recent double standard by the federal government in relation to the 26 GW Asian Renewable Energy Hub, and the doubling down by the project’s consortium by announcing an even larger 50 GW Western Green Energy Hub, it looks as if WA is not going to wait for the federal government to get its act together. 
The industry-led Scheme aims to accelerate the development of green hydrogen and its derivatives, rather than simply categorising hydrogen from a technological neutral position. According to a statement from the WA government, the SEC’s Scheme “will certify the renewable hydrogen, green ammonia or green metal has been made from renewable energy sources, and provide an embedded carbon rating. It will operate as a tracking system for the amount of greenhouse gas emissions connected with the production.” 
WA Hydrogen Industry Minister Alannah MacTiernan said the state already has a head start thanks to its competitive advantages when it comes to green resources. “Signing on to the Smart Energy Council’s Zero Carbon Certification Scheme as a founding partner reflects our commitment to making sure Western Australia continues on its path to becoming an industry leader,” MacTiernan said. 
“As a founding partner,” continued MacTiernan, “our Government will collaborate with the Smart Energy Council and its other domestic and international partners to develop and implement the scheme.”
Certification is a global concern 
It is not surprising that the peak German energy body was also a founding partner of the Scheme, as countries across the globe in need of green fuels to cut their emissions and power their futures are putting their faith in Australia’s potential. 
At the recent pv magazine Roundtables Europe 2021 event, Aurélie Beauvais, Deputy CEO SolarPower Europe noted one of the most important aspects of the development of green hydrogen at the moment is certification, which is to say, how we can know whether a hydrogen molecule is green or blue or grey or brown. “How can we define and certify renewable hydrogen,” Beauvais said, “and how can we make sure we are not double-counting the electron that’s produced?” 
In a recent forecast which predicted Australia’s low-carbon hydrogen export revenue could reach US$90 billion by 2050, Wood MacKenzie’s head of markets and transitions, Prakesh Sharma, “a stable and reliable source of low-carbon hydrogen supply becomes essential because it is impossible to tell how a given molecule of hydrogen has been produced. A guarantee of origin is therefore crucial to allow for minimal environmental impact, i.e., carbon leakage.” 
“Standards also help with risk assessment and transparent market pricing,” Sharma continued. “Australia stands to benefit as rules of hydrogen shipping, transport, storage and product quality are set and accepted internationally.”

Vaulta’s innovative blend of graphene and polymer in its battery casings have great potential as low-cost and light-weight battery modules for the coming wave of EVs. 
Battery casings in EVs help manufacturers save time and money on weight and space in their vehicles, as well as improving safety. Vaulta claims its design reduces the number of parts in EV battery casing from approximately 20 to fewer than a handful. 
“This funding from the Federal government recognises the opportunities opened up by our world-first design,” said Vaulta founder and director Dominic Spooner, who runs Vaulta out of his shared garage in Brisbane’s north, and whose design also improves thermal and electrical conductivity and ensures greater reuse and recycling of parts. 
The announcement comes on the back of several high-profile memorandum of understandings (MoUs) with Canada’s Braille Energy Systems, which produces the lithium batteries used in Aussie V8 Supercars, Focus Graphite, Grafoid and Quickstep, Australia’s largest independent aerospace composites manufacturer. 
Minister for Industry, Science and Technology Christian Porter said the funding will enable supported projects to commercialise their products and attract further investment to enter new local and global markets. Vaulta’s is “exactly the kind of job-creating innovations we want to see and support,” continued Porter, “especially in the Covid-19 recovery.” 
EV battery technology is rapidly becoming and enormous industry, and any innovation toward the streamlining and improvement of EV batteries along with their sustainability will therefore prove enormously important.
For instance, Greenpeace has said that approximately 12.85 million tonnes of lithium-ion batteries will no longer be useful for e-mobility in China alone during the next decade. Repurposing those devices for energy storage use, rather than manufacturing new batteries, would save 63.34 million tons of carbon emissions. The environmental NGO called on China’s leaders to put the repurposing of electric vehicle (EV) batteries at the core of its strategy for 2060 carbon neutrality. Technologies like Vaulta’s might just be the ticket.
