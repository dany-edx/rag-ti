In other words, he believes that when Australia finally starts meaningfully taking up EVs, households will quickly realise their cars can be efficiently used to solar shift their roof’s daytime generation.
Onto bigger visions, Washington – who is also the chairperson of Australia’s Electric Vehicle Council and co-founder of Chargefox– predicts EVs capacity to store and move electrons will eventually transform entire cities and electricity networks.
The transition to electrified transport, he says, will happen in three parts. The first and already well underway step is for EVs to replace petrol and diesel cars, consuming electricity from the grid in the process.
The second step, Washington says, will involve EVs starting to support the electricity grid. That is, “where we use electric vehicles to… essentially act as batteries to support the grid in times of need,” Washington said, speaking at the Clean Energy Council’s It’s Electrifying webinar this afternoon.

This might be done at micro-scale in solar homes or on a grid-scale level, he said, pointing to a trial in the ACT where a fleet of Nissan Leafs are providing contingency support for electricity spot markets. The time horizon for such activities to become commonplace, Washington said, is about five to six years, with industry already rapidly embracing the pathway.
The third phase is where things start to get freaky, or properly “sci-fi,” as Washington puts it. In ten to 15 years off, he predicts EVs will “become” the grid.
“That’s not to say they will replace all the poles and wires, but they will be a legitimate alternative,” he said. Such a step he added, will rely on the electrification of transport, autonomous vehicles as well as local “micro-generation”.
What he envisions is that EVs will not only be thought of as transport from point A to point B, but “rather we’ll have a situation where vehicles are merely thought of as an output of kilometres or kWh and at any given time the algorithms are determining whether they should be transporting people or transporting electrons.”
“A very simple way to think about that is if you have a highly dense community with very little solar opportunity on rooftops, you can imagine a world where people drive to the train station at work or get transported to the train station at work, and that train station has heaps of space for solar which is then pumping that into the vehicles and the vehicles are then able to take that electricity and feed it back into where ever people live and all of that will be done autonomously.”
“I think that will be the third part [of the EV transition] where vehicles will do that combined with autonomous technology.”
In the meantime, Washington described the transition towards EVs as a “clear fuel swap” bringing with it a plethora of  opportunities.
The reason, he says, other countries are pouring money into their EV industries is not because they are “blind green hippies who want to drive EVs,” but because they recognise it will contribute billions to their future economies.
Washington sees Australia’s current lack of government direction and policy on EVs as not so much stopping electrification from happening here, but rather meaning we squander the opportunity to make the most of the inevitable.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/07/wood-fed-hydrogen-plant-to-be-built-in-nsw-in-15-million-singapore-deal/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2021",Wood-fed hydrogen plant proposed for NSW in $15 million Singapore deal,"Sweetman Renewables Limited, born of the century old Sweetman’s Timber sawmill in northern New South Wales, has entered into a joint venture with Singaporean company CAC-H₂ to produce hydrogen by gasifying woodchips.
The $15 million deal will see CAC-H₂ own 80% of the Hunter Valley-based operation, while Sweetman will own 20%, responsible for providing the wood feedstock, as well as EPC engineering.
The companies are branding the enterprise Australia’s “largest green bio-hydrogen production eco-hub,” though many experts have queried the technical classification of wood as “renewable” and the energy generated by burning it as “net zero”. Such assertions rely on questionable carbon accounting, not the mention encouraging an already contentious forestry industry.
The multi-million dollar facility, named Hunter Valley One, is set to be constructed on a 30-acre site adjacent to the Sweetman’s Millfield timber mill in the Hunter Valley.
The companies believe construction should commence soon, initially saying planning applications had already been approved. Sweetman’s chairman John Halkett later clarified to pv magazine Australia that approvals related to the supply of feedstock, that is green sawmill residues, are covered by existing contractual log supply agreements with the NSW government via the Forestry Corporation of NSW.
However, the siting of the Hunter Valley One syngas facility, he said, is still under consideration and subject to further engineering and other inputs. All prospective sites are existing industrial zones and if any development application (DA) modifications are needed, they will be subject to further scoping and  consideration by the relevant local government authority if necessary.
Under the proposed deal, CAC-H₂ will bring its gasification technology which converts woodchips into 99.9% pure hydrogen via a proprietary process. “CAC-H₂ also brings Off-take Agreements for 100% of Sweetman Hydrogen and Biochar production.” This wording is slightly confusing, but it seems along with Sweetman Renewables,  the company has also registered Sweetman Hydrogen – though it isn’t clear whether that statement refers to the subsidiary Sweetman Hydrogen Pty Ltd, or just simply the hydrogen produced by Sweetman Renewables.
Either way, Sweetman is set to provide the facility 30,000 tonnes of wood biomass per annum, which will be converted into woodchips and gasified to produce hydrogen.

“We initially planned to start with just two production lines but due to large demand from both Japan and Korea, we envisage to quickly scale up the Sweetman operation to multiple lines producing Hydrogen and Biochar for export markets via a new facility at the Newcastle Port,” Arman Massoumi, Director of CAC-H₂ Group, said in the statement.
“Over the next 2 years our JV will establish new Hydrogen Hubs in every state in Australia. Sweetman has already obtained expressions of interest to establish another Hydrogen hub at Newcastle Port and in additional hubs in Queensland and Victoria,” Glenn Davies, CEO of CAC-H₂ added.
Wood, or biomass as it’s referred to by the industry, is defined as a renewable energy source both in Australia and abroad. Even though, like coal, it emits significant amounts of carbon when burned, it is classed technically as “net zero”.
In a perfect world, burning and regrowing trees is a closed carbon loop – but our world is far from perfect and scientists are increasingly arguing biomass industries are destroying trees, our only proven carbon sequestering technology, only to dump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere amid an already out of control climate crisis.
Furthermore, the piece of carbon accounting that has deemed wood-burning “net zero” pays little attention to time. When exactly carbon parity is reached is hotly contested.
Earlier this year, more than 500 scientists signed an open letter to world leaders calling on them to “stop treating the burning of biomass as carbon neutral”. Others have attempted to go through the court system to revoke the status, as was done in the European Court of Justice in 2019, and last year in South Korea.
Unlike other countries, Australia hasn’t historically relied on biomass for energy, and therefore has avoided some of the problems which have plagued Europe and the United States, where most of the woodchips are sourced.
Nonetheless, with our country’s pipeline of hydrogen bulging, projects relying on biomass are increasingly popping up.
For instance, Verdant Earth Technologies recently bought the mothballed Redbank Power Station in the Hunter region and plans to recommission the 151 MW station, now called Verdant Power Station, to run purely on biomass – sourced by Sweetman as well. Verdant also has hydrogen ambitions which it’s pursuing in the Northern Territory and elsewhere.
Likewise, Patriot Hydrogen is putting biomass at the centre of its hydrogen producing plans, though at a much smaller scale. Its P2H units, as they’re named, are essentially modular, hydrogen producing kits which run on biomass, with the company boasting they can be powered up anywhere, anytime.
Biomass is attractive to the burgeoning hydrogen industry because it provides predicable, base load power. Solar and wind, as abundant as they are here, remain at the whim of nature, giving companies that rely on burning a fuel source a more guaranteeable (though not zero-cost) input.
Using biomass to make what will go on to be sold as renewable hydrogen, Suzanne Harter, a clean energy campaigner at the Australian Conservation Fund described to pv magazine Australia as “a bit like money laundering.” 
Alongside the emissions, Harter says there are other costs to burning wood. The most obvious being the impacts it has on habitats and biodiversity. In a country still reeling from the 2020 Black Summer bushfires which burned 18.6 million hectares, nearly the size of England, and killed or displaced three billion animals, the continued logging of unburned forests in many states has been met with fierce community ire.
Victorian government is actually moving to ban the native hardwood industry while the Western Australia government also recently announced it would end logging of native forests from 2024. These stronger protections being introduced in other states is something Sweetman’s chairman John Halkett told pv magazine Australia earlier this year would give his company an even bigger share of the market. 
Halkett also said then, in July, Sweetman’s plans was to double if not treble the log input for its sawmill, growing the facility’s production by the same amount, with Halkett describing demand for hardwood as “gangbusters”. These ambitions appear to already being coming to fruition with Monday’s announcement coming off the back of Sweetman’s partnership with Verdant Earth Technologies earlier this year.
The Hunter region of NSW is set to become the home of one of the state’s first green hydrogen hubs, to which the NSW government has committed at least $70 million.
The market size for hydrogen in 2022 is projected to be around $155 billion, Sweetman noted in its statement. “By 2050, driven by a burgeoning global demand for zero-carbon emissions, the hydrogen market is expected to be valued at $12 trillion.”
While biomass is classified as net zero, it is certainly not zero carbon emissions. It remains to be seen whether hydrogen generated from that industry will come under the same scrutiny now being put on the government’s peddling of “clean hydrogen” which was recently discovered to have more emissions than if the fossil fuels used to produce it were burned directly.

Redox flow batteries (RFBs) have seen their market share for stationary storage increase in recent times and the scientific community is multiplying its efforts to overcome one of the main technical issues that are hindering their deployment on a larger scale — the so-called “crossover.”
This phenomenon, which can cause capacity losses that can reach up to 50%, occurs during charging and recharging when battery electrolyte components cross the membrane in the battery cell and the redoxmers, which are redox-active molecules that can store energy in the batteries’ electrolytes, migrate to the wrong side of the device.
Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin in the United States claim to have fabricated a non-aqueous hybrid redox flow battery that is crossover-free and, at the same time, provides high cell operation voltage and a low operating temperature.
The battery was built with a solid electrolyte membrane based on the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 natrium superionic conductor, also known as NASICON. It is able to circumvent the crossover of the liquids between the positive and negative electrodes and, simultaneously, to maintain single-ion conduction between the two electrodes to sustain the electrochemical reactions, according to the scientists. Membranes represent a significant portion of the final costs of RFBs. It is therefore important to identify the membrane technologies that could simultaneously ensure high performance and low-cost production.
The battery’s solid sodium anode was paired with a liquid methylphenothiazine (MPT) cathode through a sodium-methylphenothiazine (Na-MPT) redox couple. “The redox reactions at positive and negative electrodes are ionically linked through the transport of sodium ions between the two electrodes,” the US group explained. “The dense structure of the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 membrane ensures a complete separation of the anode and cathode and circumvents the cross-mixing of the liquid species between the two electrode chambers.”
The battery performance was evaluated at ambient temperatures and, under a medium current density of 1 mA cm−2, the Na-MPT cells exhibited a high working voltage of around 2.6 V and a coulombic efficiency of 95.0%.
The battery was described in the paper “Accessing a high-voltage nonaqueous hybrid flow battery with a sodium-methylphenothiazine chemistry and a sodium-ion solid electrolyte,” published in Energy Storage.

Beyond their well-documented potential as a low-cost, high-efficiency photovoltaic cell material, the properties of various perovskite materials make them suitable for various devices, including light-emitting diodes, photo sensors, radiation detectors and plenty more besides.
Earlier research into the economics of manufacturing has shown that perovskite solar cells could benefit from the development of such devices, since they would allow for smaller-scale production, and for manufacturers to gain experience with the materials in an industrial setting, without the bigger investment needed for large-scale PV production.
Now, scientists led by the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland have found that perovskites can detect thermal neutrons, one of the hardest to detect particles emitted by radioactive materials. Working with methylammonium lead tri-bromide, the group found that neutrons hitting the perovskite produced a small current, and when combined with a foil of gadolinium metal and a carbon electrode, this could easily be measured.
The device is described in the paper Hybrid halide perovskite neutron detectors, published in Scientific Reports. The group was able to grow perovskite crystals around the foil, demonstrating another flexibility in perovskite material that could make it interesting for yet more applications. “The property of this material is such that it can engulf anything, from a fly to a crocodile, to gadolinium,” says EPFL chemist Márton Kollár. “So it grows around the object, and even when it grows around, it stays crystalline. So this is a really fabulous feature of this material.”
Having demonstrated the usefulness of perovskites in neutron detecting, the group says it will now work to optimise the devices, varying the thickness and form of the connector try and increase the signal to noise ratio. “It’s simple, it’s cheap, and it’s cost-effective,” says László Forró, who led the research. “Now that the team has shown that the device works, the next step is refinement and potential commercialisation. This is a proof of principle, that it works. And now we can think about configuration for a very efficient detector.”
