The facility will produce 5B’s fully prefabricated “plug-and-play” Maverick PV system. The ground-mounted solar solution comprises up to 90 pre-wired PV panels that are fitted to frames that can be unfolded accordion style. The frames come preassembled on composite steel-concrete beams that replace conventional mounting structures, allowing for rapid installation on site.
The Indian facility is expected to be operational in the second half of 2024 and the parties said it has the potential to scale up to the gigawatt level.
5B Chief Executive Officer David Griffin said the partnership with Waaree will strengthen the company’s position in the surging Indian solar market and also establishes a Unites States-compliant supply chain for international markets but said it remains committed to manufacturing in Australia.
Griffin said the India plant “complements 5B’s Centre of Excellence in Adelaide and broader existing global supply chain to ensure we can deliver competitive solutions for customers and EPC partners in key markets.”
The company, with headquarters and a research and development facility in Sydney, has an established manufacturing base in South Australia and Griffin said there is potential expansion opportunities for 5B’s Adelaide Manufacturing Centre of Excellence, leveraging its skilled workforce and specialised local supply chain.
Griffin said the Adelaide facility, which has been assembling panels shipped from China into Maverick arrays, will continue to have an important role to play in the company’s ongoing expansion and product development.
“Maintaining full operational control of a manufacturing environment is necessary for production validation, iteration, and quality assurance for each product release, this is the remit of the Adelaide team,” he said.
“And as 5B develops its manufacturing processes and equipment, Adelaide remains a key development ground for its technology.”

The start of construction on the manufacturing facility in India comes after 5B landed its largest single order yet, securing a deal to supply 70 MW of its Maverick solution for a still-to-be-identified project in the US.
While commercial details of the deal remain confidential, 5B did share that the order includes approximately 1,400 Maverick arrays, containing more than 125,000 modules.
These arrays will be manufactured in the new Indian factory and delivered to the US. Deployment is scheduled to begin in the second half of 2024.
In addition to giving 5B a foothold in one of the biggest solar markets, and satisfying the US government’s efforts to diversify supply chains away from China, Griffin said the collaboration with Waaree will also allow for the direct integrating of module manufacturing with Maverick manufacturing.
The facility is being built near Waaree’s existing module manufacturing plant in Chikhli, allowing for 5B to co-optimise products as well as provide a large reduction in shipping and packaging waste.
5B had deployed more than 140 MW of its Maverick solution worldwide, with projects in Australia, Europe, Asia, South America and the United States.

1,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/06/smart-energy-expo-longi-launches-anti-dust-module-for-ci-segment/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,2024-03-06,Smart Energy Expo: Longi launches anti-dust module for C&I segment,"Launched today at Sydney’s Smart Energy Conference, Longi has introduced its new Hi-MO X6 Guardian commercial & industrial (C&I) module to the Australian market.
The module’s point of difference is that water is able to run freely off its surface, so dusty residue doesn’t build up around the edges where frame meets glass. The module, however, still has traditional framing on its longer sides, meaning for the system to work the modules must be mounted on a vertical axis rather than horizontally.

The module uses back contact or BC technology, which Longi fully transitioned its Australian ranges to in 2023. Back contact technology has advantages for panel efficiencies as it reduces shading losses. 
The Guardian module’s maximum power output is 590W. It is a big, and particularly long module, measuring 2281mm x 1134mm, and weighing in at 27.2kg.
The company is planning to launch a residential module with the same self-cleaning frame concept in Q3 or Q4 this year, for which dimensions will be around 1722mm x 1134mm.
In terms of cost, the company says the Hi-MO X6 Guardian comes in around $0.30/Watt.
Later this month, Longi will also launch a new ‘Ultra Black’ module to the residential Australian market with a power output of 440W. As the name suggests, the module is indeed ultra black with a matte finish. One of the ‘Ultra Black’ panel’s features is that it is fingerprint proof, making it easier for installers to handle without marking. Representatives for the company did, however, note this did not extend to fingertips covered in sunscreen or zinc, which still prove problematic.
Longi is not the only company in the Australian market with an anti-dust module based on a  lowered frame design. Newcomer to Australia, DAH Solar, has been supplying its ‘Full Screen’ module here since October 2023 through wholesaler Austra Energy. The DAH ‘Full Screen’ module has all edges of its frame lowered to prevent dust and water accumulating.

The agreement commits the parties to work together on the delivery of the $250 million (USD 162.6 million) project being developed near Uralla in the proposed New England Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).
ACEN has already started work on a 50 MW battery at the site but the facility will now be scaled up to 200 MW with two hours of storage capacity. The battery and adjacent solar farm will connect directly to Transgrid’s network.
ACEN Australia Managing Director David Pollington said the battery is another milestone for the New England Solar farm which is to be a major contributor to the National Electricity Market (NEM).
“Once finished, it will be one of the nation’s largest co-located solar and battery energy storage facilities and enables energy to be stored and made available to the grid when it is needed,” he said.
The 400 MW first stage of the solar facility commenced generating renewable electricity into NSW in 2023. Stage 2 will start construction in 2024.
Electricity retailer Zen Energy has inked a long-term deal for an offtake of up to 220 MW of the New England Solar project. The 11-year agreement represents up to 52% of the output of Stage 1 of the project.
Target completion of the battery energy storage system, which has potential for future expansion, is expected in 2025.
Marubeni said another of its subsidiaries, SmartestEnergy Australia, which operates an electricity wholesale and retail business, will explore the possibility of offtake agreement for electricity charged from the battery.
The announcement comes just days after ACEN secured a $150 million funding package that it plans to use to fast track plans to deliver a 9 GW portfolio of solar, wind, battery storage and pumped hydro projects in Australia.

The Brisbane-headquartered company said the $1.12 million (USD 730,000) will also support a feasibility study for the establishment of a large-scale zinc-bromine flow battery manufacturing facility in Queensland.
Redflow Chief Executive and Managing Director Tim Harris said the company – which has developed a long-duration zinc-bromine flow battery energy storage system designed for commercial and utility-scale energy storage applications – has been working towards scaling its manufacturing capabilities in response to accelerating demand for its technology in Australia and key global markets such as the United States.
“This grant will allow us to fast track our planning for the next phase of our manufacturing expansion and the potential for Queensland to be our global manufacturing hub,” he said.
“The Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan, ongoing engagements with end customers around their energy storage needs and the launch of the Queensland Battery Industry Strategy gives us confidence that it is the right time to invest in local manufacturing capability in partnership with the Queensland government.”
Harris said the feasibility study will determine an optimal factory size and location and allow Redflow to design a fully automated factory that will be essential to manufacture cost competitive batteries in the future.
“The feasibility study is the first step in the process, and we are confident of advancing our plans for manufacturing expansion in Queensland,” he said.
The total cost of the project is expected to be about $3.2 million, of which up to $1.12 million will be reimbursed by the grant funding, subject to Redflow meeting milestones including completion of the battery prototype, delivery of a draft feasibility study and delivery of a final feasibility study.
The funding announcement comes just days after Redflow received formal notice to proceed with the manufacture of batteries for a California Energy Commission-funded project in the United States.
Redflow said that the approval, issued by project developer Faraday Microgrids, provides binding contractual approval to begin manufacturing 15 MWh of long-duration energy storage solution at its Thailand factory.
The project, a large-scale solar and storage project which will provide power for the Paskenta Band of Nomlaki Indians, is Redflow’s fourth multi-MWh order through the California Energy Commission, which is actively seeking alternative energy storage options to lithium-ion batteries.
Harris said the project with Faraday and the California Energy Commission represents “a major milestone” for Redflow’s growth in North America and is its largest project to date.
Redflow will supply its ZBM3 batteries in its 200 kWh modular energy pods for the project, with shipment of the batteries expected to occur in late 2024, with installation and commissioning likely occurring in early 2025.

The Southeast Asia Investment Financing Facility, announced by Albanese on Tuesday during the ASEAN-Australia Special Summit’s CEO forum in Melbourne, is to deliver loans, guarantees, equity and insurance for projects that would boost Australian trade and investment in Southeast Asia, particularly in support of the region’s clean energy transition and infrastructure development.
“Australia’s economic future lies in our region,” Albanese said. “These initiatives represent further investments in our future and ensure we are working with Southeast Asia as it continues to grow in economic size and reach.”
The facility, to be managed by federal government-backed agency Export Finance Australia, takes its lead from the Invested: Australia’s South-East Asia Economic Strategy to 2040 paper published in 2023.
Prepared for the Australian government by Special Envoy for Southeast Asia, Nicholas Moore, said paper highlights the massive challenge the clean energy transition represents for Australia and the wider region, indicating it requires trillions of dollars in investment to achieve.

The strategy calls for an estimated $3 trillion in infrastructure investment by 2040, and similar investment for green investment to ensure diverse and resilient energy supply chains and potential to collaborate regionally on solar, electric vehicles and battery storage supply chains.
The authors estimate 60% of South-East Asia’s electricity generation capacity to 2050 will be renewables, with an estimated investment of $640 billion in hydropower, solar and wind projects by 2030 to power cross-border interconnections and electricity trading and export-oriented investment in renewables generation and grid infrastructure.
The announcement of the financing facility drew a cautious welcome from Australian Council for International Development (ACFID) Chief Executive Officer Marc Purcell who said the finer details of the new initiative will be crucial.
“In particular, we will need to see what proportion of finance is delivered as loans to governments of developing countries, and how much is private sector funds mobilised to address climate change,” he said.
“The problem is that government loans require repayments from budgets, often at the expense of development fundamentals like health and education.”
ACFID Chief of Policy and Advocacy Jessica Mackenzie was also cautious about the program, pointing to hesitancy within the sector about EFA’s Australia’s management of clean energy funding.
“Export Finance Australia is not known for its climate expertise and some voices have pointed to EFA traditionally being part of the problem, not the solution, when it comes to the region’s clean energy transition,” she said.
Until Australia last year agreed to end the financing of fossil fuel projects overseas, EFA contributed $4.4 billion to coal, oil and gas developments between 2009 and 2021.
“By contrast, NGOs in our membership have a wealth of climate expertise and experience, as do existing regional and bilateral climate bodies,” Mackenzie said.
In addition to the new $2 billion Investment Financing Facility, the federal government announced a $10 million commitment to fund clean energy programs in the region to build technical capacity and expertise.
Australian Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the Climate and Clean Energy Window will enable the Commonwealth and state and territory government agencies to build new clean energy manufacturing and trade opportunities with Southeast Asia counterparts.
“The $10 million Climate and Clean Energy Window will assist to build capability across the region to respond to climate change and accelerate the clean energy transformation,” he said.

5,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/06/european-energy-achieves-financial-close-on-victorian-solar-farm/,"FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",EV FOLEY,2024-03-06,European Energy achieves financial close on Victorian solar farm,"The Australian arm of Denmark-based European Energy announced it has reached financial close on the 56 MW Mokoan Solar Farm and commenced construction of the project near Winton in northeast Victoria.
European Energy said its in-house EPC team is steering the project through the construction phase which it anticipates will be complete in 2025. Once fully operational, the Mokoan Solar Farm, featuring bifacial solar panels spread across a 94-hectare site, is expected to generate approximately 113 GWh of clean energy annually.
“We are thrilled to reach our first financial close in Australia,” European Energy Australia Country Manager Catriona McLeod said.
“We see this as the start of many projects by European Energy in the country. We are eager to leverage our capability across renewable energy development, EPC, financing and operations to contribute to meeting Australia’s renewable energy targets.”
European Energy reached its final investment decision on the Mokoan project in November 2023 after acquiring the project from Lightsource bp in late 2022. The project received development approval from the local council in December 2018, and planning approval from the state government in June 2020.
The project finance debt funding was sourced from Norddeutsche Landesbank’s (Nord/LB) Singapore branch in the form of a loan facility.
The progress on the Mokan Solar Farm comes after European Energy recently announced it had signed a power purchase agreement with mining giant Rio Tinto for 100% of the output from the proposed 1.1 GW Upper Calliope Solar Farm being developed in Queensland.
Under the 25-year agreement, Rio Tinto will buy all power generated from the plant that is to be built and operated by European Energy, pending development and grid connection approvals.
European Energy’s Vice President of Project Development, Thorvald Spanggaard, said Australia has firmed as one of the company’s key markets.
“Australia presents a highly promising market for renewable energy projects,” he said. “We currently have over 5 GW under active development in Australia and a further 3 GW in screening, and we aim to realise these in the coming years.”
European Energy is also developing the 1 GW Sawpit Solar Farm in central Queensland.
The company has built more than 270 operating wind and solar projects and has a global development pipeline of more than 60 GW.

6,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/06/smart-energy-expo-trina-spotlights-system-supply/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",JONATHAN GIFFORD,2024-03-06,Smart Energy Expo: Trina spotlights system supply,"On the eve of the Smart Energy Expo in Sydney, Chinese giant Trina Solar presented itself as a single supplier of solar projects and demonstrated the value of this approach in a range of large-scale PV applications.
Trina highlighted the projects yesterday in an event held in the lead up to the major clean energy event underway in the New South Wales (NSW) capital this week.
With module prices at record lows, there should be no surprise that solar manufacturers are looking for value in other places. Trina has a long track record in supplying mounting structures and battery storage system alongside its modules.
Trina is highlighting the value this capability delivers to project developers in Australia this week. In particular, it is promoting Goulburn Community Farm in NSW as being a noteworthy project.
While not particularly large, the community project is significant in that it has been supplied by Trina from the ground up. The 1.35 MW solar array is couple to a 2.2 MWh TrinaStorage Elementa battery. It also employs Trina fixed-tilt mounting structures – somewhat confusingly branded TrinaTracker Fix Origin.
The Goulburn project is owned by the Community Energy Goulburn cooperative. It was developed by Komo Energy, with the installation executed by Smart Commercial Solar.
“Community Energy 4 Goulburn and Komo Energy have worked hard for years to bring cheaper, cleaner energy to Goulburn and we’re excited to deliver this significant solar and storage project for them,” said James Duckworth, the national business development manager for Smart Commercial Solar, in a statement.
Trina has also revealed a new testing project in Queensland. The project will be the first “tracking testbed” in Australia, Trina claims.
The test bed is being established at the Hills Educational Foundation, outside of Brisbane. The foundation is alongside the Hills International College, which couples golf with schooling and has a significant renewable energy component including solar, battery energy storage, and green hydrogen.
At the site, Trina is establishing a test array employing its DEG19 Vertex bifacial modules, mounted on TrinaTracker 2P trackers. The performance of the array will be analysed alongside that from a neighbouring eight-year old solar farm.
“The insights gained from this testbed will help to determine when it is economically viable to replace older solar farms with new ones,” the Trina statement reads.
At the Hills’ testing site, albedo effects will be assessed – based on a number of ground coverings, such as recycled cans, light ground coverings, and cement sheeting. The enhanced rear-side albedo as a result of the ground coverings will presumably boost power output.
The Hills College will also investigate agrivoltaic applications using the test array. In particular, it will assess if  “protein-rich fungus” can be grown underneath the arrays, using “white-panted offcuts of shipping containers.”
“Agrivoltaics is something Australia’s farming community is interested to explore,” said Joseph Marinov, CEO of Hills Educational Foundation. “Creating an environment conducive for crops to grow under the solar modules will help the country’s farmers to embrace renewable energy.”
Trina now claims that 95% of the steel used in its TrinaTracker mounting systems is sourced from Australian producers.
“As solar projects become increasingly complex, having a single procurement source helps to streamline processes, allowing for faster delivery and unified after-sales service. This approach not only reduces costs but also ensures efficiency,” said Edison Zhou, Trina Solar head of Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands.
The Smart Energy Expo runs March 6-7.
