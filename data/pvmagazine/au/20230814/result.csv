The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has committed $20.9 million to help fund the demonstration project while Queensland government-owned power company Stanwell Corporation is backing the initiative with $3 million. Stanwell will also provide the site and facilities for the field deployment of the electrolyser.
Hysata is developing ultra-high efficiency hydrogen electrolyser technology that it said eliminates almost all resistance in the electrolysis process and has the potential to significantly shift the economics of green hydrogen production.
“Existing electrolysers face energy losses from electrical resistance and gaseous bubbles forming on electrodes, reducing the overall efficiency of the system,” Hysata said, adding that its technology “has been proven to produce hydrogen with 95% (41.5 kWh/kg) efficiency, well ahead of incumbent technologies that operate with efficiencies close to 75% (52.5 kWh/kg).”
ARENA said the technology has the “potential to reduce the cost of renewable hydrogen production through reduced electricity inputs.”
“The technology also offers lower balance of plant costs, with reduced electrical resistance resulting reduced cooling requirements,” it said. “If delivered at scale, these reduced input costs will help lower the levelised cost of hydrogen, making renewable hydrogen a commercially viable energy resource.”

Hysata plans to develop and test a 5 MW unit at its new 8,000 sqm electrolyser manufacturing facility in Port
Kembla on the New South Wales south coast. The electrolyser array will then undergo testing and validation before it is relocated to Queensland where it will be installed adjacent to the 1,460 MW Stanwell Power Station near Rockhampton. The site has available land, water and grid connection capacity.
Hysata said initial development of the system is already underway with the field pilot at Stanwell due to commence in 2025.
Hysata Chief Executive Officer Paul Barrett said the project is a pivotal moment in the company’s rapid technological and commercial scaling, as it works towards fulfilling a 9.4 GW pipeline of signed conditional orders and letters of intent.
“Our plan encompasses the construction of a 100 MW per annum production line, with commercial-scale units
scheduled for delivery in 2025, including the 5 MW electrolyser unit for Stanwell’s project. And we
will ramp up rapidly to giga-scale capacity thereafter,” he said.
“We look forward to creating more local jobs and strengthening Australia’s sovereign manufacturing capabilities through this project, which will pave the way for Hysata’s scaling to fulfil a multi-billion-dollar pipeline of orders from around the world.”
ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said the project is a crucial step to enabling purchase orders for the technology.
“This electrolyser technology could be a game-changer for renewable hydrogen,” he said.
“The demonstration at Stanwell’s site will be key to unlocking commercial demand for Hysata’s product by proving the technology works at scale.”
The new funding builds on $8.98 million awarded by ARENA under the German-Australian HyGATE program, with an additional $9 million contribution from Germany’s Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).
With the help of the HyGATE grant, Hysata is currently working on the development of a 200 kW electrolyser system that will demonstrate the key components of the 5 MW commercial-scale demonstration unit.

The new conductors are to be used on the multi-billion dollar Humelink project that will connect Snowy Hydro 2.0 to the grid in southern NSW and the VNI West project that will connect the NSW and Victorian electricity grids.
Transgrid Executive General Manager, Delivery, Craig Stallan, said the transaction is part of the company’s ongoing push to de-risk a highly competitive global supply chain as energy companies look to secure the specialised equipment needed to deliver major transmission projects.
“Our major transmission projects involve a long shopping list for big kit, and we are competing with the likes of Europe, the USA and the United Kingdom to secure highly sought after slots on production lines,” he said.
“By securing supply now, we can deliver projects faster and cheaper. It’s also reducing risk as we compete with other energy companies and nations to secure critical, large-scale equipment, materials and skilled labour to deliver the projects Australia needs.”
ZTT Australia General Manager Dean Farrar said the conductors will be produced at the group’s manufacturing campus in Hekou, in China’s southeast, and will be delivered to Australia in 2024 and 2025.
Transgrid Chief Executive Officer Brett Redman said the contract with ZTT is part of the network operator’s Powering Tomorrow Together program which bundles procurement for major projects including HumeLink, VNI West and the tri-state EnergyConnect project.
Over the next decade, Transgrid plans to invest $14 billion to build new transmission infrastructure and Redman said the procurement program allows the operator to purchase materials like substation equipment, earlier and at a lower cost, enabling limited resources to be used across multiple projects.
Redman said Transgrid has this year already secured 15 shunt reactors and 25 single-phase transformers worth approximately $150 million, with arrival commencing in late 2024.
“We are also finalising a separate contract with another Australian company to supply other locally-produced conductor elements,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/14/aemc-proposes-rule-changes-for-major-transmission-projects/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 14, 2023",AEMC proposes rule changes for major transmission projects,"As authorities seek to accelerate the expansion of the grid to cater for Australia’s transition to renewables, the country’s energy market rule marker has published draft regulations for community engagement that would form part of the process for securing approvals on major transmission projects.
The Australian Energy Market Commission’s (AEMC) draft conditions would formally require transmission businesses looking to develop major new projects to engage earlier in the planning process and continue the engagement throughout transmission regulatory investment test (the RIT-T).
AEMC Chair Anna Collyer said the draft rules aim to provide greater transparency and reduce uncertainty around major transmission projects, by stipulating when transmission businesses are required to engage, who they must engage with and how it needs to occur.
“‘Social licence’ is a term that is used a lot when we talk about infrastructure delivery, but behind the term are individuals and communities who deserve timely access to transparent information and clarity about their rights,” she said.
“With more than 10,000 kilometres of transmission lines to be built to support the national electricity market, these rules for engagement are an important step in improving the community engagement process on major projects.”
Collyer said getting the right frameworks in place means “conversations between communities and transmission businesses should happen sooner, so that concerns can be identified and addressed by networks earlier in the process.”
Under the draft rules, transmission businesses would be required to engage with “stakeholders who are reasonably expected to be affected” by development of major transmission projects including local landowners, local councils, local community members and traditional owners.
Those stakeholders would have to receive information that is “clear, accurate, relevant and timely and explains the rationale for the proposed project.” The draft conditions say the information and means of communication must be tailored to the needs of different stakeholders, and those stakeholders must have “sufficient opportunity to consider and respond” to the information provided.
The draft rules would apply throughout the planning of “actionable” or “future” Integrated System Plan (ISP) projects and renewable energy zones (REZs).
Collyer said the draft rules have been informed by “multiple rounds of feedback” and take in recommendations from the AEMC’s Transmission Planning and Investment Review which was completed earlier this year.
“Stakeholders will now have another opportunity to provide feedback for consideration in response to these draft rules,” she said.
The AEMC will hold a virtual public forum on 29 August 2023 while written stakeholder submissions are being accepted until 28 September 2023.

The V2G charging bays at the university’s Bedford campus in southern Adelaide will be used to charge EVs and also feed renewable energy from compatible vehicles back into the campus electricity grid as part of the new virtual power plant (VPP) established by Engie for the trial.
The university said the project, first announced last year, demonstrates the potential of EVs to be harnessed as ‘batteries on wheels’ to support South Australia’s electricity system during periods of peak demand.
Rik De Buyserie, chief executive officer of Engie’s Australia and New Zealand operations, said the integration of renewable energy, EV charging and demand management systems will allow for renewable output to better matched to a site’s demand.
“This program not only helps Flinders University achieve its sustainability targets, but also signals the huge uplift in demand and increasing awareness of the extended benefits of transitioning to an EV fleet,” he said.
The V2G chargers are part of a much larger charging hub at the university that includes four regular DC and 15 AC chargers with the entire network delivering electricity generated by the university’s 1.8 MW onsite solar array and Engie’s Willogoleche Wind Farm, located about 200 kilometres north of the university.
The launch of the V2G trial comes eight months after South Australia became the first jurisdiction In Australia to permit bidirectional charging technology. In December 2022 SA Power Networks approved connections for V2G chargers and a month later approved the use of Jet Charge’s bi-directional chargers in homes.
South Australian Transport Minister Tom Koutsantonis said data from the Flinders University trial will be used to frame and inform the future direction of EVs in the state.
“More and more electric vehicles will be hitting our roads in years to come as we travel towards net zero emissions,” he said. “With trials like this investigating the possibilities for broad use of this technology we can be confident we are on the right track.”
