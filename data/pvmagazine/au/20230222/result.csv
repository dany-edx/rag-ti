AVESS owns 50% of South Korean vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) company Korid Energy, and it is this battery technology and design AVESS is seeking to bring to Down Under.
To that end, the company will be deploying two demonstration batteries at an edge-of-grid mine in Western Australia, one with a capacity of 50 kW / 250 kWh and another 25 kW / 250 kWh – giving them five and 10 hours of storage duration respectively.
“This year is all about proving our VRFB batteries,” Managing Director Young Yu tells pv magazine Australia. Specifically, the company is seeking to demonstrate its VRFB technology’s improved efficiencies and low storage cost in actual Australian conditions.
“We need to localise our product and technology,” Yu says, “and that is what we are doing in July and August.”

Once that box is ticked, Yu says AVESS will look to raise $15 million (USD 10.2 million) from “cornerstone investors” to roll out its Australian manufacturing plan. The aim is to start this from 2024, with the company allocating three years to set up the capacity so that it can be manufacturing or assembling VRFBs from 2027.
Too early to give exact details on scale, Yu says the ambition is to be producing “quite a significant amount” of megawatt hours. Western Australia is the obvious choice for the manufacturing plant – though Yu says other states are also being considered.
“It makes huge sense for us to set up a [manufacturing] operation here because of [Australia’s] mining capabilities in the vanadium industry sector. We see huge resources captive here in the Australian market we can take advantage of,” Yu says, pointing out that Australia’s abundance of vanadium also makes it a strong candidate to produce vanadium electrolytes.
To that end, AVESS recently signed a deal to partner with South Korea’s Unicoh Specialty Chemicals to explore the development of electrolyte manufacturing for VRFBs. “Ultimately, we want to bring that know-how to Australia and work with Australian mining companies to produce electrolytes here.”

The name of the mining company deploying the two demonstration batteries has not yet been made public, but Yu says the discussions are close to being finalised.
The first cab off the demonstrative rank will be the 50 kW VRFB – currently under construction. Continuum Engineering has been hired to help design and develop the Perth battery.
It is expected to be fully assembled by Q2 and ready to be deployed in Q3 to a to-be-confirmed mine site. 
The demonstration seeks to measure arbitrage capability in a solar/grid connection and benchmark a levelised cost of storage (LCOS). “This exercise will aid in validating our proprietary technology in Australia, and the data obtained from the study will be key as AVESS works towards the Australian Renewable Energy Agency set target of $0.10 per kWh LCOS by 2030,” the company has said.
AVESS’ VRFB technology, developed in South Korea by subsidiary Korid, claims to have improved efficiency rates from the industry norm. “Our levelised cost of storage we’ve compared to other companies and we know we are performing really well,” Yu adds.
These figures, however, come from projects and tests in South Korea, and AVESS is keen to prove they hold true in Australia.
The company is also planning a second, longer duration demonstration battery, potentially at the same mine site – though this remains unconfirmed. Korid Energy is delivering this second battery, with Yu saying the subsidiary is in the final stages of assembly. He expects it will be shipped to AVESS next quarter.
Vanadium redox flow batteries were invented in Australia in the 1980s but remain quite novel. Yu believes this novelty, and the perceived risks that go with it, are finally subsiding. Both the advantages and disadvantages of flow batteries are becoming better known and accepted, he says. “I think industry is seeing that and looking to give vanadium a go.”
Joining in a much larger zeitgeist, he says a core driver for AVESS is to be a wholly Australian-owned company producing Australian-made tech, and with that bringing manufacturing back onshore. In short, the company is looking to be part of the “Make Australia Make” movement that has gripped renewable industries.

Yu says AVESS is currently speaking to state governments and regional stakeholders about potential sites for manufacturing. Given the vast majority of vanadium projects and companies are based in Western Australia, the state is a top contender – though Yu points out Queensland is also emerging as another vanadium hub.
By 2027, the company is hoping to have roughly 200 staff on board. It is seeking to cater to the Australian market, as well as potentially exporting its VRFBs in future. 
Naturally, vanadium miners will form an integral part of AVESS’ supply chain. “We do have a very keen interest in development plans,” Yu says. “We have been communicating with a couple of vanadium producers, or want-to-be producers… and are trying to share our vision to see how we can collaborate.”
The hope is that eventually AVESS will be able to source its electrolyte from Australian suppliers – but until that day comes, Yu says the company will need to rely on China, which currently dominates the vanadium electrolyte industry.
This dominance is what drove AVESS to set up a joint venture with Unicoh Specialty Chemicals, Yu says. The company recently signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the South Korean chemical specialists to look into vanadium electrolyte production.
Yu says the company eventually wants to produce its own electrolyte here in Australia in collaboration with a local vanadium miner. Such a collaboration would help AVESS establish a vertically integrated supply chain, something Yu deems “very very important.”
“We think vanadium is a critical mineral which needs to be managed properly and we really don’t want one nation in the world actually dominating this particular sector,” he says, referring to China.
“This is a requirement for us to work together in the Australian market to assist the Australian vanadium miners to actually start producing as soon as possible,” he adds.
Like the United States, Yu says South Korea is increasingly turning to Australia to supply key materials and components for its booming battery industries. “Korea is looking at Australia for strong partnership,” Yu says, especially when it comes to critical minerals like vanadium.

GCube products will now be underwritten on locally authorised paper issued by Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co Australia, GCube says.
This will enable it to offer its suite of products to a wider range of Australian clients and brokers, GCube says, and better cater to the needs of the Australian market.
“The faster decision-making that writing on local paper facilitates means that the company can improve its service to existing Australian clients and offer that same, high-quality service to a broader range of projects in the country,” GCube CEO Fraser McLachlan said.
GCube has been active in Australia for 15 years, but only via London. Now with its local admitted branch office, GCube says it will ramp up its regional presence, seeking to support a wider variety of insureds and build out its local customer base.
“Changing political headwinds in Australia, both at the state and federal level, are driving significant demand for renewables in the country,” it said. “As the local market grows, however, so too do the risks faced by local renewables developers, asset managers and investors, and subsequent need for coverage required to mitigate those risks.”

The fractional drop came as a relief to the market with Origin’s share prices jumping almost 14% in early trading.

Origin’s board welcomed the revised and still conditional offer, saying it considers the proposal could deliver “significant value to shareholders.” Origin intends to continue discussions with the consortium, which includes US gas supplier MidOcean Energy, managed by US investment giant EIG Partners, alongside Brookfield Asset Management.
In a separate statement, the bidding consortium said “all parties are expeditiously working towards the signing of a Scheme Implementation Deed.”
Specifically, the revised share-buying scheme will see the consortium offer $8.90 (USD 6.09) per share for the first 100,000 shares, and $4.33 per share plus USD 3.19 per share for the remainder. 
The bidders noted the inclusion of a US dollar as part of the offer reflects the exposure of Origin’s LNG business to the currency.
If Origin’s takeover is realised, it would be hugely significant for Australia. Brookfield, the lead bidder and the company set to take on all of Origin’s energy generation and retailing businesses, has reiterated its commitment to investing an additional $20 billion by 2030 to build new renewable capacity and storage in Australia.
Brookfield is currently creating the world’s largest fund for renewable investments, the Brookfield Global Transition Fund, which is headed up by Mark Carney, one of the world’s most influential climate change power brokers.
However, the takeover remains in the balance, with the deal still subject to approvals from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Foreign Investment Review Board.
Given Brookfield’s recent takeover of Victorian network, AusNet Services, the Australian competition regulator’s review could prove a hurdle.
In 2022, Brookfield shocked Australia by teaming up with tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes to put in a surprise bid for AGL, Australia’s biggest “gentailer” and carbon emitter. 
The “Trojan horse” move would have been the world’s largest decarbonisation project, but ultimately couldn’t be realised. Despite that, both Brookfield and Cannon-Brookes have continued to pursue Australia’s two biggest gentailers, AGL and Origin, separately.
Cannon-Brookes has since bought a significant stake in AGL and has successfully managed to shift the company’s decarbonisation strategy, blocking its demerger plan and electing a number of people to its board.
Meanwhile, Brookfield has opted to pursue Origin as its vehicle for energy transition. If the takeover goes through, Brookfield will use the Origin platform to build a portfolio of solar, wind and storage assets in Australia, selling this energy via Origin’s established retail platform.
Under the proposal, consortium partner MidOcean would acquire Origin’s gas business, including its 27.5% a stake in Australia Pacific LNG.

According to the network operator, prior to the adoption of the ZAS technology, used conductors needed to be shipped overseas for the removal of the outer aluminium layer for recycling. The ZAS machine can do this onsite, an innovation which Transgrid claims cuts 90% of the emissions involved in recycling conductors.
But not only that, Transgrid forecasts an improved return on its scrap metal recycling of up to $3 million (USD 2.06 million) over the next three to five years.
By feeding conductors into the ZAS machine under tension, the previously outsourced task of removing the outer aluminium layer is now performed on site and efficiently, with said aluminium cut into 30 to 70 mm pieces for easy smelting.
At the other end of the ZAS machine, the undamaged conductor’s steel core is wound onto a cable drum, it too ready for recycling.
It was one of Transgrid’s field coordinators, Mitch Coppock, who pitched the idea of using the ZAS machine. “Something like that hasn’t been done in Australia before,” said Coppock. “Anything innovative we can do is very important in our industry especially anything that can have good long-term effects on the environment.”
It’s an “everyone wins” situation, says Coppock, as Transgrid can get a return on its scrap metal three times higher than before, while “the environment wins with reduced emissions and local businesses benefit too as they get readily available and processed aluminium.”
The trial has already seen 40 km of conductors processed through the ZAS machine in Western Sydney, with each metre of conductor yielding approximately a kilogram of aluminium.
It has been a period of firsts for the network operator, which recently began trialling its first electric ute among a 400-strong diesel vehicle fleet.

An international public-private consortium will look at how vehicle-integrated PV can support the transition to an all-electric transport system in Europe. The SolarMoves project, commissioned by the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG MOVE), will use data from solar vehicles to study the impact on electrical recharging infrastructure policy and regulations in EU in the coming years.
Throughout the three-year pilot project, cars, trucks, buses, and vans will be equipped with integrated solar panels and sensors to measure and determine solar irradiation in real-world conditions across Europe.
The team, which includes the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE), and EV car manufacturer Sono Motors will model the efficiency of the solar vehicles and then verify that with on-the-road monitoring and testing.
“The results of this monitoring will give insight into the increase in efficiency of electric vehicles when solar technology is integrated and will be used to ascertain the overall potential of this technology and make predictions on the required recharging infrastructure for the potential scenario in which a significant part of the electrical vehicles are equipped with solar modules in the next years,” TNO said in a statement.
The findings of the study will then be translated into a set of policy recommendations for the European Commission.
TNO estimates that electric vehicles with installed solar panels could represent 10% of the entire market by 2030. According to one of its other studies, solar-powered EVs can charge 25% less per year, and up to 40% less in sunny places.
