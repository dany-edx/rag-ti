The study looked at 11 high-income countries which have claimed “absolute decoupling,” defined as decreasing CO2 emissions alongside increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Those nations include Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. 
These countries are pursuing a “green growth” model – claiming they can reconcile economic growth with climate targets. Every one of the assessed nations was found to be reducing emissions orders of magnitude too slowly to limit global warming to well below 2°C.
Among the 11 countries examined, emission reductions between 2013 and 2019 were on average just 1.6% per year. By contrast, reduction rates of 30% per year are needed by 2025 for countries to comply with their fair-shares of the global carbon budget for 1.5°C.
Australia was found to be one of the worst-performing countries in the cohort, with the UK coming out on top.
“There is nothing green about economic growth in high-income countries,” lead author of the study, Jefim Vogel, from the Sustainability Research Institute at the University of Leeds, UK, said.
“Calling such highly insufficient emission reductions ‘green growth’ is misleading, it is essentially greenwashing. For growth to be legitimately considered ‘green’, it must be consistent with the climate targets and fairness principles of the Paris Agreement – but high-income countries have not achieved anything close to this, and are highly unlikely to achieve it in the future.”
“Continued economic growth in high-income countries is at odds with the twin goal of averting catastrophic climate breakdown and upholding fairness principles that protect development prospects in lower-income countries,” Vogel added.
Alarmingly, the researchers did not include emissions from agriculture, forestry, and land use, nor emissions from international aviation and shipping. If included, high-income countries would need to reduce emissions much faster again to comply with the Paris Agreement.
Researchers also took a lenient definition of ‘fair share’ of the carbon budget, using an approach that did not directly account for historical inequality in global emissions.
“The pursuit of economic growth in high-income countries makes it virtually impossible to achieve the required emission reductions. If high-income countries are to meet their Paris obligations, they should pursue post-growth approaches: scale down energy-intensive and less-necessary forms of production, reduce the consumption of the rich, shift from private cars to public transit. This reduces energy demand and enables us to decarbonise much faster,” co-author of the study Professor Jason Hickel from the Institute for Environmental Science and Technology at the Autonomous University of Barcelona said.
The authors suggested a range of steps to speed up emission reductions in fair and socially beneficial ways, including:

The project has been funded for three years and aims to commercialise “ultra-low-cost, flexible perovskite solar cell” fabrication using New South Wales company Halocell’s roll-to-roll (R2R) production process at its Wagga Wagga plant.
The solar cells will reportedly be “graphene-enhanced,” with First Graphene’s focus centring on research, development (R&D) and cost-effective graphene-based electrode replacements for high-cost conductor materials, such as gold and silver, used in cell production. 
It says such formulations can be 38% more efficient than traditional solar cells and 83% cheaper to produce.
“Our collaboration with Halocell Energy and QUT will help develop new materials and processing technology for high performance perovskite solar cells, opening the door for high-tech commercial materials and manufacturing of cell components in Australia,” First Graphene’s Managing Director and CEO Michael Bell said.
“Validation of these graphene-based materials will help build a strong business case for full-scale commercial production of both perovskite cells and the materials needed to make them in large volumes,” Bell added.
Despite the fact silicon solar cell technology was invented at the University of New South Wales, Australia does no manufacture solar cells at all today. Tindo Solar is Australia’s only solar manufacturing company, but imports solar cells from China.
This project is seeking to re-inject some life into Australia’s solar manufacturing scene. In terms of the project responsibilities, First Graphene provide R&D resources including labour, equipment, laboratory space, formulation and testing expertise to produce optimum graphene systems. First Graphene has a view to scale up and supply graphene products in the latter phases, it said.
Meanwhile, the Queensland University of Technology is set to provide expertise in material development, facilities for advanced material characterisation and testing, and assistance in developing Halocell’s roll-to-roll process for perovskite cells and module production.
The $2 million grant was awarded under Round 14 of the government’s CRC-P collaborative research funding stream and will support the project over three years.

Led by researchers from the University of Sydney with co-authors from federal government agency Geoscience Australia, the team’s findings suggest elevated predicted lithium densities in soils across the central western region of Queensland, southern New South Wales and parts of Victoria. 
“We’ve developed the first map of lithium in Australian soils which identifies areas with elevated concentrations,” the study’s senior author Professor Minasny said. He added the findings could have significant implications for the lithium industry in Australia.

The team used digital soil mapping techniques developed at the University of Sydney to gauge extractable lithium content present in soil samples collected across Australia.
While the highest lithium concentrations were found near the Mount Marion deposit of Western Australia (WA), the study suggests potential lithium sources in Australia spread well beyond the popular WA exploration region.
“The map agrees with existing mines and highlights areas that can be potential future lithium sources,” Professor Minasny said.

The research aimed to paint a comprehensive overview of lithium distribution across Australia, noting this is influenced by a variety of environmental factors including climate, geology and vegetation.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/05/nsw-government-starts-talks-to-extend-life-of-australias-largest-coal-plant-eraring/,"MARKETS,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2023","NSW government starts talks to extend life of Australia’s largest coal plant, Eraring","The NSW government has this morning confirmed it will “engage” with Origin Energy to extend operations of the 2.9 GW Eraring power station, located north of Sydney near Newcastle, due to concerns that renewable projects are not being brought online quickly enough to replace the state’s withdrawing coal capacity.
In a press conference on Tuesday, the new NSW energy minister, Penny Sharpe, said she couldn’t give a dollar figure on the cost of keeping Eraring open past 2025. “I’m not going to speculate on what the costs could be,” she said. 
Earlier this week, former NSW energy minister Matt Kean claimed it would cost $3 billion (USD 1.9 billion) to keep Eraring operational for another two years, but Sharpe rebutted this figure, calling it “unverified.”

Sharpe also noted the possibility of Origin funding the extension itself, adding there may be other ways to “buffer” energy security risks in the state without Eraring.
The announcement quickly drew criticism, with Climate Energy Finance director, Tim Buckley, calling the move “totally unjustified.”
Greenpeace Australia Pacific’s CEO, David Ritter, meanwhile described it as “bonkers” and a “backwards step.”
“Propping up an old polluting coal-burning power station with public money during both the climate and cost of living crises is bonkers. The Minns government must immediately rule out the possibility of spending taxpayer funds on keeping Eraring Power Station open beyond 2025,” Ritter said.
Buckley added public money would be far better spent accelerating the transition. He called on the NSW government to replicate Queensland’s progressive coal export royalty program, adding: “it’s high time the myth of the presumed centrality of end-of-life, expensive, high emissions coal power to energy security was busted. In 2022, forced outages at Australia’s ageing coal power fleet meant coal capacity fell way short of forecasts, crippling the national electricity market.”
Minister Sharpe did not provide a timeframe on how much longer the government or its consultants want Eraring to stay operational, nor how many of its four units would be required. She did, however, emphasise that it would be a “temporary” extension. 
NSW’s Minns Labor government, which won power in March, also released the details of a so-called energy system “check up” NSW Electricity Supply and Reliability Review completed by consultant Cameron O’Reilly and a small panel. Among the 54 recommendations made in the report was advice to consider postponing Eraring’s closure. Of the recommendations, the NSW government has already accepted 44 in full, and three in part.

The connection of large-scale renewable projects not only in NSW but across Australia has stalled in 2023, and so too has the approval of such projects. While the state has a solid pipeline of proposed renewable projects, whether they can be approved, built and connected before the state loses its coal generators is seen as questionable.
“You can’t go anywhere without people talking about the slowness in planning,” Sharpe noted during the press conference. “We’re looking at streamlining the planning processes that will allow these projects to happen as quickly as possible.”
AGL Energy completed the closure of the nearby Liddell coal plant in April, which had 2 GW of capacity at its peak. NSW’s remaining coal plants, Bayswater, Mount Piper, and Vales Point are expected to be mothballed within the decade.
Australia needs to be reducing emissions more than 30 times faster than it did from 2013-2019 to comply with the Paris Agreement, a paper published in The Lancet Planetary Health journal has found.
The study looked at 11 high-income countries that have ‘decoupled’ emissions and economic growth, including Australia, and found each of them was reducing emissions far too slowly to limit global warming to well below 2°C. Australia was one of the worst-performing countries in the cohort.
The researchers concluded continuous economic growth is likely incompatible with appropriate emissions reduction.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/05/greenpeace-notes-widespread-greenwashing-among-fossil-fuel-companies/,"RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,EUROPE,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2023",Greenpeace notes widespread greenwashing among fossil fuel companies,"From pv magazine Global
A new study published by Greenpeace found widespread use of misleading numbers and strategies in reporting on emissions and climate impacts among 12 of the largest oil companies with headquarters in Europe.
The study, titled Dirty Dozen: The climate greenwashing of 12 European Oil Companies, looks into financial statements published by six of the world’s largest oil companies – Shell, TotalEnergies, BP, Equinor, Eni, Repsol, and another six smaller players that still play a major role in the energy supply of their respective European markets – OMV, PKN Orlen, MOL Group, Wintershall Dea, Petrol Group, Ina Croatia.
These companies have enjoyed huge revenues over the past year, with their 2022 profits increasing by an average of 75% over the previous year. Despite this, new investments made by the companies increased on average by just over half that amount – 37%. And 92.7% of these investments were made in the continued extraction of fossil oil and gas.
This comes in spite of the common claim among large fossil fuel companies that higher profits are necessary to provide the means to finance a transition to renewable energy, which Greenpeace describes as “like eating more to have the energy for the diet.”
All 12 of the companies in the studies produced at least 98% of their energy in 2022 from fossil fuels, with an average of just 0.3% from renewable sources. And those which are making any investment in “low carbon” technologies are focused on offsetting and carbon capture – two strategies whose effectiveness in reducing emissions is in serious doubt.
The study also finds that while most of the companies involved have made a public commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050, none has anything resembling a coherent strategy in place to achieve this.
“…no major oil company can show a comprehensible plan for a “net zero” in 2050. There is, if at all, a slow start in the 2020s, which is then miraculously supposed to lead to a rapid transformation after 2030. In other words, the solution to the climate problem is postponed to the future or to the next CEO,” the report stated.
The report also noted a range of strategies used by some of the 12 companies that seem designed to mislead the public over their commitment to emissions reduction. From creative definitions of what constitutes “low carbon” for investment, to simply misleading visual layouts – such as Shell placing “conventional fuels” in fourth place on a list of its energy portfolio, despite these accounting for more than 90% of its energy production.
Greenpeace calls for various measures to be put in place to change this situation, placing efforts to reduce demand for fossil fuels at the centre of its proposal. “Similar to the coal sector, the focus should therefore be on a rapid economic and political downsizing of the oil and gas sector, on skimming profits, avoiding stranded assets and, above all, on a rapid reduction of oil and gas demand,” they state.
The report calls for a comprehensive demand reduction strategy to be put in place at EU level, including a ban on short distance flights and promotion of zero-carbon fuels in long distance aviation, noting that “The benefits of these new fuels must be independently confirmed in a life-cycle approach in order to exclude, for example, the use of biofuels, which can cause high climate damage along their production chain.”
Other industries earmarked for action include marine shipping – which also requires support for alternative clean fuels, and the petrochemical industry which should see restrictions on per capita consumption of plastic materials.
Greenpeace also states that, in combination with demand reduction, these measures can be accompanied supply side measures such as windfall tax on profits, a ranking of the most environmentally damaging fossil fuel supply chains, and a stop on exploration of new oil projects across EU territories and the North Sea.
Further, the report calls for increased regulations on international oil companies, including a general ban on advertising and much tighter reporting definitions to address greenwashing in public statements.

GCL Technology Holdings Limited recorded CNY 20.945 billion ($446 million) of revenue in the first half of 2023, from CNY 14.775 billion in the same period last year, according to its unaudited results. It attributed the increase in sales to its solar materials division, as well as its growing granular silicon business. Its net profit attributable to shareholders stood at CNY 5.518 billion in the January-June period, down from CNY 7.062 billion in the first six months of 2022. The group said its production costs for granular silicon at its Leshan GCL site were approximately CNY 35.68/kg, which it claims is lower than the industry average.
Aiko Solar recorded CNY 16.249 billion of revenue in the first half of 2023, up 1.65% year on year. Its net profit attributable to shareholders reached CNY 1.309 billion, up 119.6% from the first half of 2022. The company said that panels featuring “ABC cells,” its N-type IBC technology, had an average selling price of CNY 2.2/W in the first half of this year.
China Energy Investment Group (CHN Energy) has awarded its second 2023 PV panel product tender through its Qinghai unit. Das Solar, Trina Solar, JA Solar, and JinkoSolar collectively secured a 1.643 GW order, divided into four bids, with panel prices ranging from CNY1.192/W to CNY1.23/W. Trina Solar won the lowest-priced bid, while the other three companies secured one winning bid each. Longi was the second choice in all four bids. CHN Energy said it expects all panels to be delivered by the end of August 2024.
JA Solar says its has decided to invest around CNY 2.72 billion in 5 GW of N-type solar cell capacity in Vietnam. It said the project will be constructed within 10 months.
