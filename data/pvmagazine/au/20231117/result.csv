https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/17/future-looks-bright-for-cst-power-as-decarbonisation-focus-shifts-beyond-2030/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"NOVEMBER 17, 2023",Future looks bright for CST power as decarbonisation focus shifts beyond 2030,"October 2023 may prove to be a turning point in Australia’s energy transition. For the first time, I heard broader public debate about the need to begin implementing decarbonisation activities and strategies that target post-2030 emission reduction targets.
This includes calls for more investment in long duration (10-plus hour) intraday renewable energy storage to progressively displace coal and gas usage at night. Proponents argue that the systematic deployment of long-duration storage could enable Australia to more readily achieve its emission reduction targets, move more quickly to a high renewable energy system (over 80%), and achieve this at a lower cost to energy users.
Understandably, much of the government and industry focus up to this point has been on achieving 2030 emission reduction targets, which typically fall between 30% to 50%. While decarbonisation is by no means easy, there are well proven technology pathways available to achieve these 2030 emission reduction targets. In simple terms, it’s deploying solar PV and wind at-scale as quickly as possible, backed up with several hours of battery storage to manage peaks and provide grid services. That’s where investment has focused to date, because it is the easiest, and least risk pathway to meet government and industry 2030 targets.
However, a question is increasingly being asked – is it the timeliest and most cost-effective pathway over the longer term to achieve net zero? There is a risk that our current 2030 focus could see us continue to rely on fossil fuels for a longer period of time and for a higher proportion of our energy needs, particularly for overnight electricity and hard-to-abate industries.
What is required is a whole-of-system approach that enables a more balanced portfolio of short- and longer-term decarbonisation initiatives.
A new report commissioned by the Australian Solar Thermal Research Institute (ASTRI) provides insights for policymakers and decisionmakers about the value of early investment in longer duration (10-plus hours), intraday energy storage technologies. The report clearly indicates that investment in such technologies can not only contribute to meeting our 2030 decarbonisation targets but can also make the net-zero pathway to 2050 easier and ensure capital is allocated efficiently, thereby minimising costs to society.
The Australian Concentrating Solar Thermal (CST) Value Proposition prepared by engineering firm Fichtner and assisted by consultancy ITP Renewables, assesses CST’s role and value across four Australian use cases: grid connected power; remote area power (mining); industrial process heat; and green fuels production. The report’s findings show that CST has a major role to play in cost-effectively decarbonising electricity, industry and fuels over the short- and long-term.

For those readers not familiar with CST, it is a renewable technology that uses mirrors to capture and concentrate the sun’s energy which is then stored as thermal energy (up to 1,000°C). The technology stores between 12 to 20 hours of thermal on a daily cycle, which can then be used to generate electricity, process heat, or both.
One of the key advantages of CST is that the electricity or heat that it generates is fully dispatchable – it can be used on demand at any time of day or night. CST is also a complementary technology to solar PV / wind with several hours of battery storage. While the sun is shining, PV generates daytime power while CST stores thermal energy. When the sun goes down, CST is then available to generate firm power for 12 to 15 hours overnight. When used in this manner, CST with solar PV delivers the best energy system outcome from a cost and emission abatement perspective. It is also the best combination to progressively replace dispatchable coal and gas-fired generation.
The inherent value of CST systems in grid connected applications is their long intraday storage, which can be used to generate fully dispatchable electricity for 12 to 15 hours overnight. In essence, CST systems use their intraday storage to fill in the gaps when variable wind and solar PV generation cannot meet demand. CST can also provide similar grid services to that currently being provided by gas and coal power plants.
The report found that a realistic uptake trajectory beginning around 2025, while likely to require some initial policy intervention, would see steady CST growth that would leave Australia’s electricity system around $10 billion better off by 2050. This is largely due to the avoidance of unnecessary spending on other storage technologies (e.g. 4-plus hour-long duration battery storage systems). In essence, the report indicates that taking a long-term approach to energy system planning is going to be critical in optimising spending and achieving Australia’s emissions reductions targets out to 2020 and beyond.
The report assessed CST in the National Electricity Market (NEM) and Western Australia’s South West Interconnected System (SWIS). The NEM modelling indicates CST uptake of 5.6 GW by 2050, dispatching around 10% of total electricity. SWIS modelling suggests rapid CST uptake from 2030 onwards growing to 840 MW by 2050 and dispatching as much as 20% of total electricity.
Most of Australia’s major miners are racing to meet ambitious emissions reductions targets and are quickly realising they will be unable to achieve cost effective, 100% emissions free power with PV, wind and batteries alone.
However, CST offers reasons for optimism. The report found that combining CST with solar PV and (in some cases) wind, results in the lowest Levelised Cost of Energy (LCoE) for remote area power generation. Miners who are not considering CST as part of their future plans risk losing out with higher costs of production due to rising fossil fuel and carbon costs. This is in contrast to companies that invest early in CST, who gain access to low cost, emissions free power.
Manufacturers are also struggling with achieving decarbonisation targets. Where sufficient on-site land is available, and in areas with moderate to high solar radiation, the report finds that CST is the most cost effective technology pathways for the capture and storage of mid- to high-temperature process heat.
The report indicates that CST systems can help to reduce and ultimately eliminate manufacturers’ dependence on gas. The report found that based on current costs, and good solar radiation, CST is cost competitive for gas prices above $16.7/GJ ($60/MWh) and for renewable heat shares of up to 70 – 75%. Moving forward, the report indicates that by 2030, the cost of CST generated heat is expected to fall by up to 20%, resulting in a cost competitive solution for gas prices above $12.5/GJ ($45/MWh).
Perhaps the most surprising and promising finding from the report was CST’s potential to produce least cost renewable fuels. This included green hydrogen (using Solid Oxide Electrolysis), ammonia and methanol. With respect to methanol, the report indicated that the use of CST could achieve a cost reduction of up to 40% compared with alternative renewable pathways.
The report found that CST’s ability to deliver a combined heat and power solution within the one technology has major production, and cost benefits. Specifically, it provides an optimal balance of renewable power for hydrogen production and 24/7 production stability, alongside renewable heat for improved fuel production synthesis.
The report noted that, with the shipping and aviation industries seeking to wean themselves off dirty fuels, CST provides a clean, and low-cost alternative. Given its climate and high levels of sunshine, Australia is the ideal place to deploy CST at-scale for green fuel production, with the potential to create a new export industry that can help replace the country’s dependence on coal and gas exports.
Now it’s over to policymakers and industry. The challenge ahead of us is clear, and the report shows the pivotal role CST can play in overcoming it. However, getting CST deployed requires a shift in thinking and policy that balances investment in short- and long-term outcomes, with a stronger focus beyond the immediate 2030 emission target horizon.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/17/feds-tip-70-million-into-kwinana-hydrogen-hub-as-bp-eyes-1-5-gw-capacity-project/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 17, 2023",Feds tip $70 million into Kwinana hydrogen hub as bp eyes 1.5 GW capacity project,"Energy giant bp’s plans to produce green hydrogen at its Kwinana Energy Hub in Western Australia have reached a major milestone with the company’s H2Kwinana project entering front-end engineering and design (FEED).
The company said the H2Kwinana project, supported by $70 million (USD 45 million) from the Australian government as part of its Regional Hydrogen Hubs program, is to include a 100 MW electrolyser, with the potential to expand to a total of 1.5 GW production in subsequent phases.
The project also involves the installation of hydrogen storage, compression and truck loading facilities and upgrades to bp’s existing on-site hydrogen pipeline system.
When operational, the facility could produce more than 14,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per annum for industrial use and heavy transport.
Site works for H2Kwinana are already underway, with construction proper to start in 2026 with the project expected to be delivered by mid-2027.
The project is part of bp’s plans to transition the site near Fremantle, which has been serving as an import terminal since the oil refinery shut in 2021, into an energy hub to produce green hydrogen and other renewable fuels, including renewable diesel and aviation fuel.
Lucy Nation, bp’s vice president of hydrogen in Australia and the Asia Pacific, said the project will leverage existing infrastructure with the hydrogen produced from water and renewable power having the potential to decarbonise the planned biorefinery where hydrogen is to be made from natural gas and biogas.
“We are repurposing existing process units, tanks, pipelines and utilities from the former refinery as the starting point for Kwinana Renewable Fuels and H2Kwinana,” Nation said.
“Both of these projects will allow us to supply ourselves and our customers with products that allow them to meet their own emissions targets while also contributing to Australia’s decarbonisation targets.”

The H2Kwinana project is part of a growing pipeline of green energy projects bp is pursuing in Western Australia.
Earlier this year bp announced it had secured land for a proposed 10 GW wind and solar generation project that would be used to power an export-scale green hydrogen and ammonia production facility in the state’s mid-west.
The company has also acquired a stake in the 26 GW Asian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) project planned for Western Australia’s Pilbara region.
“We are all-in in Australia, with major investment plans in WA and specifically in the Kwinana area,” bp Australia President Frédéric Baudry said.
“H2K at Kwinana is bp’s strategy in action, leading from the front in decarbonisation in the region and providing energy security through diversity.”
The H2Kwinana project has attracted support from the state and federal governments with Australian Energy Minister Chris Bowen announcing a $70 million investment as part of its Regional Hydrogen Hubs program.
Bowen said Australia’s hydrogen industry is projected to generate $50 billion in additional gross domestic product by 2050, creating tens of thousands of jobs in regional Australia as Australia transforms to a renewable energy superpower.
“Investing in an Australian hydrogen industry is investing in Australia’s future,” he said.
“Kwinana has been an industrial and economic powerhouse for decades, making it an ideal location for a hydrogen hub that can support decarbonisation of heavy industry and connect our renewable resources to the world.”
The Australian government is investing more than $500 million in regional hydrogen hubs, including in Gladstone, Townsville, the Hunter, Bell Bay, Pilbara and Port Bonython.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/17/behind-the-meter-battery-drives-tonsley-towards-100-renewables-target/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 17, 2023",Behind-the-meter battery drives Tonsley towards 100% renewables target,"Australian commercial solar outfit CleanPeak Energy has switched on a 4.5 MWh lithium-ion battery that has been coupled with an existing 5 MW rooftop solar system to help power operations at the 61-hectare Tonsley Innovation District in Adelaide’s southern suburbs.
The behind-the-meter battery will store excess energy created by 13,000 solar panels installed atop the Main Assembly Building at precinct which is home to more than 140 businesses, including many in the clean technology and renewables space.
The rooftop solar system generates more than 7 GWh of clean energy per year, providing about 60% of the precinct’s current energy needs during daylight hours.
The battery will provide energy outside of daylight hours across the district, including to the homes of Tonsley Village residents, which feed into the Tonsley microgrid.
CleanPeak Chief Executive Officer Philip Graham said the battery will play an important role in the Tonsley Innovation District’s energy scheme, moving the microgrid closer to being fully solar powered.
“The battery will be charged with solar energy generated on site that would otherwise be exported to the grid and made available for use across Tonsley during other times,” he said.
“It will also reduce congestion in the network by taking excess solar out of the system and storing it for use at the site during the evenings. It moves us closer to realising our ambition to power the site from 100% renewable sources, delivering a net-zero strategy for the Tonsley precinct.”
CleanPeak, which owns and operates the Tonsley microgrid, said the battery is to be expanded with planned future stages to take its capacity to 10 MWh.
“This is an important project for us as it is the largest battery we have installed behind the meter anywhere in Australia,” Graham said.

The Tonsley project is one of more than 50 operating solar and battery sites CleanPeak has in Australia.
Established in 2017, the specialist distributed energy business was initially focused on delivering rooftop renewable energy assets for the commercial and industrial sector but has in recent times moved into utility-scale solar.
Earlier this month it signed an agreement to acquire three operating solar farms with a combined capacity of 14.3 MW in Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. It has also commenced construction on the 30 MW (40 MWp) Wangaratta Solar Farm project being developed in northeast Victoria.

Tesla, via the recently formed Tesla Energy Ventures Australia, is seeking an electricity retailer licence in New South Wales (NSW), Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). The company is also applying to the Victorian Essential Services Commission for a licence to sell electricity in that state.
In its application to the AER, Tesla said it would be targeting both residential and commercial customers, noting that now is “an opportune time to become a retailer and bring new offers to the market.”
Tesla has already provided the technology for multiple large-scale battery energy storage systems in Australia, including the Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia and the Victoria Big Battery.
It also enjoyed success at the residential level with its Powerwall home battery system, including in the South Australian Virtual Power Plant (VPP), and the Tesla Energy Plan (TEP) which spans NSW, the ACT, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria.
The VPP and the energy plan are currently managed through electricity and gas retailer Energy Locals but Tesla said it is seeking to obtain an electricity retailer authorisation so it can be the provider and retailer of the offerings.
“Electric cars, batteries, and renewable energy generation and storage already exist independently but when combined, they become even more powerful – that is the future we want,” the company said.
Tesla, which has a market capitalisation of more than $770 billion (USD 500 billion), said it plans a phased approach to retail directly to existing customers before broadening its scope to attract additional customers.
Tesla said its technology-driven capabilities will allow it to bring “differentiated product offerings” to market and continue to “disrupt the traditional incumbents in the market.”
“Tesla is committed to delivering on a fully sustainable residential ecosystem,” it said.
AER will accept submissions on Tesla’s electricity retailer authorisation application until 18 December 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/17/new-mppt-approach-for-multi-string-pv-systems-under-partial-shading/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EGYPT,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,"NOVEMBER 17, 2023",New MPPT approach for multi-string PV systems under partial shading,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at Egypt’s South Valley University have developed a novel control strategy to deal with partial shading in PV systems. The new approach uses a multi-string PV system with a converter control strategy that utilises a direct duty cycle to track the maximum power point (MPP) under shade.
“This study proposes a reconfiguration of the PV system to suppress the negative impact of partial shading on the PV-system performance by dividing the PV system into multiple parallel strings,” the scientists explained. “In this work, the proposed system comprises four strings, with each string comprising three paralleled sub-strings.”
The proposed multi-maximum power point tracking (MMPPT) approach involves connecting each string to a DC-DC converter, optimising power extraction from individual strings of PV solar panels. This differs from the tested single-MPPT (SMPPT) arrangement in a PV system, where a single converter is connected to parallel strings of solar panels.
The MMPPT approach uses a direct duty‑cycle control strategy to find the duty cycles of desired converters. Then, using direct duty-cycle control (DDCC), it adapts the duty-cycle of the DC-DC converter to the calculated results, regulating the produced power.
Calculating the desired duty cycle involves using the PV system’s existing sensors to estimate radiation, derived from changes in PV cell current and voltage.
“The proposed technique minimises the overall system cost by reducing the number of the required sensors by utilising a radiation estimation strategy,” the researchers said. “The DDCC technique boosts the overall system efficiency by the steady-state oscillations elimination, hardware simplification, and ease of implementation. Additionally, the DDCC has a fast-tracking speed for global maximum power point tracking (GMPPT) extraction during partial shading conditions.”
The researchers presented the results of the comparison between the MMPPT and the SMPPT system in “Investigation of single and multiple MPPT structures of solar PV‑system under partial shading conditions considering direct duty‑cycle controller,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports. The systems were simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK software, under three shade conditions.
All four PV strings were subjected to uniform irradiance of 1,000 W/m2 in the first shading pattern. In the second pattern, however, the first two strings had a constant irradiation profile of 1,000 W/m2, while the other two had a uniform irradiance profile of 1,000 W/m2 for half a second, and then stepped down to 500 W/m2 for another half a second.
In the third pattern, the first two strings were again under a uniform irradiance profile of 1,000 W/m2, while the remaining two started with 1000 W/m2 for 0.3 seconds, changed to 500 W/m2 for another 0.3 seconds and decreased to 250 w/m2 for 0.4 seconds.
“Under these conditions, the average efficiency of the SMPPT system is found to be 98.98%, while the MMPPT system achieves an efficiency of 99.81%. These findings validate the proposed approach,” the researchers concluded. “A real radiation dataset from Benban, a location in southern Egypt, is used in MMPPT configuration. The results demonstrate that the proposed control system enhances overall system effectiveness while reducing installation costs.”
