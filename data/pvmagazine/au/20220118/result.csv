The program is supported by a whopping $14 million grant from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA). The funding comes less than a year after 5B closed a $12 million funding round, including investment support from former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Smart Energy Council director Simon Holmes à Court. 
Only last month 5B acquired an Adelaide manufacturing plant ahead of the global gigawatt-scale push of its rapidly deployable, modular, prefabricated Maverick solar arrays. In a statement, 5B said it’s Maverick solution was already cost-competitive in Australia as well as a number of other markets, and that this program is designed to “leverage advanced automation to dramatically improve the scalability and cost of 5Bs solution, enabling end customers to benefit from clean, solar energy at AUD30 cents per watt installed by 2030.” 
This ambition requires a 35% cost reduction by 2023 and a 70% cost reduction by 2030, both targets which 5B has said it is forecasted to meet. 
The company’s recently launched 50kW(DC) Maverick, optimised for the 550W module class, has already been installed in 52 projects in Australia, the US, Latin America and India, totalling 32MW of capacity. The Maverick arrays have proven popular with remote regions and mining operations, including a 12 MW system which it delivered with Enerven for SA Water and a 4.3 MW project it delivered with independent power provider Nomadic Energy Australia for miner Northern Star Resources in Western Australia. 5B’s Maverick system is also the preferred technology for Sun Cable’s massive 17-20 GW solar farm being developed in the Northern Territory with the intent to export solar power to Singapore via a subsea transmission cable.

5B plans to utilise approximately two-thirds of the $33.4 million investment for the design and construction of an Advanced Manufacturing Pilot Line (AMPL). With the final third, 5B says that it will use robots to install solar arrays using GPS-guided deployment (GGD) technology. That’s right, GPS-guided solar installation robots. 
It is 5B’s claim that artificial intelligence-enabled solar installation is the next frontier of solar technology, an advance that would allow for faster, cheaper, safer and more efficient solar farm construction. 
“This program will drive a step change in our automation capability and enable local manufacturing in Australia,” says 5B chief operating office Nicole Kuepper-Russell. “We are grateful for ARENA’s support – investment like this is essential to realise the opportunity to build Australia’s reputation as a clean energy superpower, exporting cutting edge clean technology to the world.” 
Of course, the Australian government’s Low Emissions Technology Statement’s (LETS) stretch goal of ultra low cost solar generation at $15/MWh (approximately a third of today’s cost), means that ARENA is more than willing to fund such projects of ambition like 5B’s. 

ARENA CEO Darren Miller said funding 5B would certainly help reduce the cost of solar. “While solar PV and wind are recognised as the lowest cost form of generation in Australia today,” said Miller, “further cost reductions are required to optimise Australia’s transition to renewable electricity and to enable emerging industries such as renewable hydrogen and low emissions metals.” 
“5B is an Australian success story at the forefront of solar innovation,” continued Miller. “Having started in 2013, they are now becoming leaders in locally manufactured ultra low cost solar products that could reshape our solar industry and achieve our important aim of 30 cents per installed watt at utility scale by 2030.” 
“The world needs massive scale, ultra low cost solar power fast and this funding will accelerate the delivery of that” added Kuepper-Russell. 
The news comes only a week after ARENA announced $40 million in research and development funding up for grabs across two solar streams.

The Philippines’ Department of Energy (DoE) has published the list of operational renewable energy projects that are eligible for the renewable portfolio standards (RPS), which mandates the country’s electricity providers to source an agreed portion of their energy supply from renewable energy power projects.
The list includes 62 solar projects totalling 1,312.9MW, 36 hydropower facilities equaling 412.8MW, 36 biomass schemes with an aggregate capacity of 264.8MW, seven wind farms with a total power of 409.9MW, and six geothermal power plants totalling 218.5MW.
As for the solar source, the selected projects range in size from 0.21 to 100.6MW. According to the document, some plants have already been operating under the country’s FIT scheme, while others were planned to operate under the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) or a bilateral power purchase agreement (PPA).
According to the DOE Secretary, Alfonso Cusi, around 8.5GW of renewable energy projects participated in the selection process.
The minimum level of electricity contracted from renewable energy (RE) developers under the RPS scheme is currently 1% but the DoE is now considering raising it to 2.52% starting from 2023.
Recent statistics released by the International Renewable Energy Agency show that the Philippines had an installed PV capacity of 1.04GW under the country’s renewable energy law at the end of 2020. Most of the nation’s solar facilities were secured under the old feed-in tariff regime, auctions, and net metering programs.
The government of the Philippines also launched a 2GW renewables auction last June. Overall, it plans to install 15GW of renewables capacity by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/18/neoen-starts-work-on-its-most-ambitious-project/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 18, 2022",Neoen starts work on its ‘most ambitious project’,"A major player in Australia’s clean energy landscape, Neoen on Monday announced it had given the go ahead to the first stage of its Goyder Renewables Zone, a project which will has been granted development approval for a total of 1200 MW of wind generation, 600 MW of solar generation and 900 MW of battery storage capacity, making it South Australia’s largest renewable project.
Neoen’s chairman and CEO, Xavier Barbaro, said the company is thrilled to break ground at Goyder, describing it as the most ambitious project in Neoen’s portfolio. “Boosted by now having 5.4 GW of assets in operation or under construction, we are more confident than ever in our ability to achieve our target of 10 GW in 2025,” Barbaro added.
Neoen is still a while off realising the full scale of its $3 billion Goyder Renewables Zone vision though, having only just commenced construction on the initial 412 MW Goyder South Stage 1 wind farm. The stage 1 wind farm is set to be completed by 2024 and will connect to the Robertstown substation.
The sizeable future stages of the project will only be “unlocked” with the new 800 MW transmission interconnector linking South Australia with New South Wales, Project EnergyConnect, which is slated for commissioning in 2023 and will hopefully be completed by 2025. 
Neoen
The transmission interconnector will allow South Australia become a serious renewable energy exporter, with the state likely to be running on 100% renewables long before its target of 2030. (In December, the state ran for a week on renewables which were significantly curtailed, indicating the region already has surplus clean energy with nowhere to go).
The Australian Capital Territory’s (ACT) government has signed a contract with Neoen to source electricity from the Goyder wind farm, allowing Canberra’s electricity supply will continue to be sourced from 100% renewable electricity in the coming years. “This will allow us to accommodate a growing population, support renewable energy initiatives such as electric vehicles and transition our economy off fossil gas,” ACT Minister for Sustainability, Shane Rattenbury, said.
“We are delighted to start building the first stage of our Goyder Renewables Zone, Neoen’s most competitive giga-project,” Neoen Australia’s Managing Director, Louis de Sambucy, said. “We look forward to building on this strong foundation, adding solar and batteries into the future to deliver firm 24/7 renewable energy.”
Neoen is developing the biggest pipeline of utility-scale batteries in Australia by a long shot. The company officially switched on its 300 MW / 450 MWh Victorian big battery in Geelong in December 2021, and on the very same day announced plans for 300MW and 800MWh battery in Blyth, north of Adelaide.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/18/three-major-miners-jump-on-electric-train-trend/,"EV,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 18, 2022",Three major miners jump on electric train trend,"With mining and resource companies scrambling for decarbonisation pathways, three of the world’s biggest players have announced they will purchase battery-electric locomotives in quick succession of one another. 
On Monday, BHP group announced it would purchase four battery-electric locomotives, two from Progress Rail, owned by mining and construction equipment giant Caterpillar, with another two from Wabtec Corporation. 
Less than a week earlier, Rio Tinto announced it would buy four battery-electric trains from Wabtec which, like BHP, it plans to use for its iron ore operation in the Pilbara region of Western Australia (WA). 
Fortescue Metals will purchase just two electric trains for its operations – presumably also in Western Australia, though the company did not specify.
The wave of announcements come after Gina Rinehart-controlled company Roy Hill announced it had purchased Wabtec’s FLXdrive battery-electric train with an energy capacity of 7 MWh for its Pilbara operations back in September 2021.
Progress Rail
The purchase of these initial trains seems to mark the beginning of trials with battery-electric locomotives for all these miners, a number of which flagged that they would also be testing ‘energy recapture’ opportunities.
Both BHP and Rio Tinto estimate that transitioning their entire fleet of rail locomotives would reduce their carbon emissions in the Pilbara by around 30% annually.
Consistently topping the list of the globe’s biggest mining companies, BHP Group seems to be hedging its bets, placing orders with both Progress Rail and Wabtec. From Progress Rail the company will receive two EMD Joule locomotives which have a 14.5 MWh battery capacity. From Wabtec, it will get two FLXdrive battery-electric locomotives.
The four locomotives are scheduled for delivery in late 2023, with BHP saying the trials to be conducted with them will support the planned electrification of its iron ore fleet of more than 180 locomotives.
“By working with two global leaders in Progress Rail and Wabtec, we can broaden the scope of our trials and be better informed as we prepare for the planned replacement of our diesel-powered iron ore rail fleet,” BHP Group Procurement Officer, James Agar, said.
The trains will deliver iron ore from BHP’s Pilbara mines to the Port Hedland export facility, with the company testing performance and emissions reduction capabilities. According to the company, its fully-laden iron ore trains in WA typically comprise of four diesel-electric locomotives pulling around 270 cars carrying a total of 38,000 tonnes of iron ore.
“The trials will also test unique ‘energy recapture’ opportunities using the rail network’s natural topography to further reduce the trains’ overall power demand,” BHP’s announcement said. “On the way to port, locomotives can capture energy from braking on downhill slopes (energy that would otherwise be lost) and use it to help power empty trains back to the Pilbara.”
BHP has previously announced partnerships with Caterpillar and Komatsu to develop zero emissions haul trucks.
Like BHP and Roy Hill, Rio Tinto will be purchasing Wabtec’s 7 MWh FLXdrive battery-electric train. It’s hoping to start its initial trials with the new locomotives in early 2024.
The company plans to recharge its four new trains at purpose-built charging stations to be located at either the port or at its mining sites. Like BHP, it will also be looking to generate additional energy while its trains are in transit through a regenerative braking system which takes energy from the train and uses it to recharge the onboard batteries.
Fortescue has decided to go with Progress Rail’s train, which appears to have almost double the capacity of Wabtec’s, claiming 14.5 MWh. The two BE14.5BB locomotives will be manufactured at the Progress Rail facility in Sete Lagoas, Brazil.
“The purchase of these new battery powered locomotives marks an important milestone… as we diversify from a pure play iron ore producer to a green renewables and resources company,” Fortescue CEO Elizabeth Gaines said.

In support of the Victorian government’s Victorian Renewable Hydrogen Industry Development Plan, Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change Lily D’Ambrosio announced $6.6 million in funds through the Renewable Hydrogen Commercialisation Pathways Fund in support of six projects seeking to utilise green hydrogen for “real-world applications”, including: 
On top of these grants, D’Ambrosio also announced $800,000 via the Renewable Hydrogen Business Ready Fund to be shared among eight recipients seeking to develop their business cases or proceed with feasibility studies.

“Renewable hydrogen is a key part of our clean energy transition,” said D’Ambrosio, “ensuring we can meet our target of halving emissions by 2030 and hit net zero by 2050.” 
“These exciting projects will help businesses push the frontiers of renewable hydrogen and embrace this clean energy solution,” continued D’Ambrosio, before adding that the renewable hydrogen sector will both create jobs and drive down emissions. 
The Victorian Renewable Hydrogen Industry Development Plan identified hydrogen as having the “potential to provide zero-emissions transport across road, rail, air and sea.” And highlighted hydrogen fuel cel electric vehicles (FCEVs) as “an emerging technology potentially well-suited to Victoria’s transport sector. With transport accounting for twenty percent of Victoria’s total emissions, the development and application of FCEVs could be crucial in minimising emissions in this difficult to abate sector of the economy.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/18/fortescue-partners-with-german-raw-materials-giant-covestro-in-landmark-green-hydrogen-supply-deal/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,GERMANY",BLAKE MATICH,"JANUARY 18, 2022",Fortescue partners with German raw materials giant Covestro in landmark green hydrogen supply deal,"Fortescue Future Industries’ (FFI), the wholly owned subsidiary of Australian-based iron ore giant Fortescue Metals Group, is continuing to act on its similarly gigantic green hydrogen ambitions with the announcement of a long-term supply deal with leading German polymer company Covestro. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) will see FFI supply Covestro with green hydrogen and its derivatives, including green ammonia, starting as early as 2024. 
The MoU states that FFI and Covestro plan to formalise an agreement which will see the former supply the latter with the equivalent of up to 100,000 tonnes of green hydrogen annually. That amount is enough to reduce Covestro’s CO2 emissions by up to 900,000 tonnes a year through the replacement of its current usage of grey hydrogen. 
Though the announcement does not state where exactly FFI’s supply will come from, it does state the deliveries are vaguely earmarked for three potential locations – Asia, North America and Europe. 
FFI founder and Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest has previously announced ambitious plans to build one of the biggest renewable energy portfolios in the world, delivering more than 235 GW of renewable capacity. And in recent months, FFI has also announced plans with AGL to flip New South Wales’s coal generators in the Hunter Valley to green hydrogen, to build the world’s biggest electrolyser manufacturing plant in Queensland as well as a 1 GW solar manufacturing plant, presumably also in Queensland though the location is not yet finalised. 
Considering Swinburne University of Technology senior research fellow Steven Percy’s research shows far north Queensland and Tasmania are the best and cheapest locations to produce green hydrogen, Queensland seems a likely source. 
“This is a ground-breaking collaboration which reinforces the power of green hydrogen to accelerate the decarbonisation of some of the most energy-intensive industries around the world,” said Forrest. “FFI and Covestro share the belief that green hydrogen and green ammonia will play a crucial role in enabling companies to reach their climate targets and preventing runaway global warming.” 
“We look forward to working with Covestro to supply their green hydrogen needs,” continued Forrest, “and collaborating with Germany to enable it to become the world leader in global decarbonisation, green hydrogen and ammonia.” 
Covestro uses hydrogen and ammonia as feedstock in the production of its polymers that are used in industries stretching from automotive to construction and electronics. Many of these industries are considered hard to decarbonise without green hydrogen. The company has committed itself to the energy transition and is seeking alternatives to fossil fuels via renewables. 
Covestro CEO Markus Steilemann said the company is delighted that “FFI shares our circular economy vision and is willing to take courageous steps to foster the urgently needed market ramp-up for green hydrogen.” 
“Our collaboration with FFI underlines our ambition to pioneer the transition towards a circular economy and climate-neutral production. Green hydrogen and its derivatives play a key role for the chemical industry, both as an alternative feedstock and a source of clean energy,” continued Steilemann, adding that the MoU “will be an important step forward in our efforts to offer more sustainable products that also reduce the carbon footprint of our customer industries.” 
In a video that accompanied the announcement, Forrest described Australia’s sunshine as “iconic” and something which could prove a “great export hit, one that can create jobs, grow economies and help save our cooking planet.

Responding from a frightfully cold looking Leverkusen, Germany, Steilemann said he was jealous of Australia’s sun and noted that “it would be so great to have a little bit of sun from Australia here in Germany.”
Forrest went on to express his excitement for the partnership, which would see the trade of Australian solar (in the form of green hydrogen) with Germany. 
FFI’s ambition is to produce 150 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030, accelerating to 50 million tonnes per year in the following decade.

Rapid growth of the global hydrogen economy can bring significant geoeconomic and geopolitical shifts disrupting global trade and bilateral energy relations, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Already today, over 30 countries and regions are planning for active commerce heralding a considerable growth in cross-border hydrogen trade.
The agency estimates that over 30% of hydrogen could be traded across borders by 2050, a higher share than natural gas today. According to its latest analysis Geopolitics of the Energy Transformation: The Hydrogen Factor, hydrogen is set to change the geography of energy trade and regionalise energy relations, with the emergence of new centres of geopolitical influence built on the production and use of hydrogen, as traditional oil and gas trade declines.
Net energy importers such as Chile, Morocco, and Namibia are emerging as green hydrogen exporters while fossil fuel exporters, such as Australia, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, are increasingly considering clean hydrogen to diversify their economies. Some countries that expect to be importers are already deploying dedicated hydrogen diplomacy such as Japan and Germany.
“As more players and new classes of net importers and exporters emerge on the world stage, hydrogen trade is unlikely to become weaponised and cartelised, in contrast to the geopolitical influence of oil and gas,” IRENA says. However, the hydrogen business will be more competitive and less lucrative than oil and gas.
According to IRENA, hydrogen is set to cover up to 12% of global energy use by 2050, driven by the climate urgency and countries’ commitments to net zero. “Hydrogen is clearly riding on the renewable energy revolution with green hydrogen emerging as a game changer for achieving climate neutrality without compromising industrial growth and social development,” says Francesco La Camera, director-general of IRENA. “But hydrogen is not a new oil. And the transition is not a fuel replacement but a shift to a new system with political, technical, environmental, and economic disruptions.”
In terms of the supply-demand ratio, the technical potential for hydrogen production significantly exceeds the estimated global demand. Therefore, realising the potential of regions like Africa, the Americas, the Middle East, and Oceania could limit the risk of export concentration, but many countries will need technology transfers, infrastructure, and investment at scale, IRENA says.
The report sees the 2020s as a big race for technology leadership, as costs are likely to fall sharply with learning and scaling-up of needed infrastructure. But demand is expected to only take off in the mid-2030s. By that time, green hydrogen will cost-compete with fossil-fuel hydrogen globally, according to IRENA, and this is poised to happen even earlier in countries like China, Brazil, and India. Green hydrogen was already affordable in Europe during the 2021 spike in natural gas prices.
Further, the manufacturing of equipment like electrolysers and fuel cells could drive business in the coming years. In fact, estimates point to a $50-60 billion market potential for electrolysers and a $21-25 billion market for fuel cells by the middle of the century. China, Japan and Europe have already developed a head start in the production, IRENA notes, but innovation and emerging technologies will shape the current manufacturing landscape further.
