The solar program is part of the city’s Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) which includes sourcing 100% of the city’s electricity needs from renewables by 2030 and achieving a 70% reduction of emissions on 2019 levels in the same timeframe. The energy action plan, which targets net zero emissions by 2050, also includes key performance indicators, including sourcing 50% renewable electricity and 35% emissions reductions by 2025.
With the total cost of the solar rollout estimated at $6 million, council said maintaining existing spending levels would delay completion of the program to 2040. The planned $600,000 investment is almost twice the amount that was allocated to the program in the city’s 2021-22 budget.
Council said initial analysis conducted by the city indicated that accelerating the roll out of its solar program will lead to a $3.3 million saving in energy costs to the city and ratepayers by 2040, compared to business as usual.
Stirling Mayor Mark Irwin said the increased spend means the city is on track to reach its 50% renewable interim target by 2025. The solar program, which will see solar systems installed on at least 24 city-owned buildings, will deliver 21% of the 2025 renewables target with the remaining 29% to be sourced from a power purchase agreement (PPA) the city announced in December 2021.
Stirling, which encompasses more than 100 square kilometres and includes northern Perth suburbs of Scarborough, Trigg and North Beach, is among a group of more than 50 Western Australian local government associations to sign a long-term PPA negotiated by the WA Local Government Association (WALGA).

The joint energy purchasing initiative enables the group to purchase energy from WA’s main south-western grid, large- and small-scale generation certificates and Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs).
“Our priority is to reduce the consumption of grid-powered electricity on city infrastructure or replace it with renewable sources to decrease carbon emissions,” he said.
WALGA said the project is set to deliver an estimated collective saving of $5 million per annum across all participating local governments.
“Our priority is to reduce the consumption of grid-powered electricity on city infrastructure or replace it with renewable sources to decrease carbon emissions,” he said.
Irwin said the escalation of the city’s solar program was in keeping with the community’s widespread support for faster action on climate change, and that the city would continue to invest to reduce emissions and bring down energy costs over the long term.
“When designing the corporate commitments in our SEAP 2020-2030, community consultation showed 92% support for a 100% renewables target by 2030, and 81% support for our 70% emissions reduction target by 2030,” he said.
Irwin said the solar program is just one of a series of renewable energy options being by the city.
“An investigation into the feasibility of our transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is in progress, with three already endorsed for purchase in the 2022/23 fleet replacement program for our parking services, and a four-week trial currently underway with an EV waste truck,” he said.

Redflow managing director and chief executive officer Tim Harris said the company’s ZBM3 battery zinc-bromine flow battery is now certified to be integrated with Sol-Ark’s North American code-approved products.
Harris said the development is an important step in the execution of the company’s plans to expand into the US market, which he described as one of the biggest markets for storage in the world.
“Integration with Sol-Ark’s well-established product line enables Redflow to deploy its zinc-bromine flow batteries in the United States SME (small to medium-sized enterprise) and C&I (commercial and industrial) markets,” he said, adding the collaboration would create “exciting opportunities” for Redflow and Sol-Ark to work together to deploy new smaller scale systems across the US.
The announcement comes just months after US non-profit standards development organisation Underwriters Laboratories revealed it would include Redflow batteries in a test program to study the key technical attributes of redox flow batteries under nominal and off-nominal conditions. The research aims to enhance the knowledge base around the operating and safety characteristics of zinc-bromine flow batteries, enabling interested parties to better understand and compare a broad range of product chemistries.
Months earlier, Redflow had signed a US$1.2 million agreement with tech company Anaergia to supply a 2MWh energy storage system, comprising 192 zinc-bromine flow batteries, to Anaergia’s bioenergy facility in California.

Redflow’s 10kWh 48V ZBM3 ZBM3 battery is the world’s smallest commercially available zinc-bromine flow battery. Its modular, scalable design makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from small commercial installations to multi-megawatt hour storage systems.
Redflow’s Battery Management System architect Simon Hackett said the testing had been completed at the company’s Integration and Testing facility in South Australia.
Hackett said the testing had demonstrated complete compatibility between Redflow’s ZBM3 zinc-bromine flow battery and Sol-Ark’s product line of advanced hybrid inverters for solar PV and energy storage.
“The integration testing between Sol-Ark’s product line and Redflow’s batteries was simply seamless,” he said. “With a simple CANBus connection between the Redflow BMS and the Sol-Ark inverter, everything just … works.”
Sol-Ark founder and chief executive officer Tom Brennan welcomed the successful completion of integration testing, saying the flow batteries have an important role to play in the future energy storage eco-system.
“From small to large commercial installations, our innovative product range is the enabler of scalable and sustainable renewable energy deployments in this rapidly growing market,” he said.

The 12-month-long Solar Connect trial, which is scheduled to commence next month, is one of a series of trials, models and investigations being rolled out as part of the $12.5m Alice Springs Future Grid project, a collaborative effort led by the Intyal­heme Cen­tre for Future Ener­gy to iden­ti­fy and over­come bar­ri­ers to high renewables grids.
Future Grid project director Lyndon Frearson said households involved in the town-wide VPP, the first residential VPP in the Northern Territory (NT), will share solar and bat­tery pow­er in ways that ben­e­fit the Alice Springs grid and form the next gen­er­a­tion of more sus­tain­able ener­gy solutions.
Frearson said although smaller than many other VPPs already operating in Australia, Solar Connect represents one of the most complex integrations of multiple energy technologies in the country to date.
“While many successful VPP trials have been run, they are proportionally smaller, compared to the size of the grid within which they operate, and usually focus on one type of technology,” he said. “What is distinctive about Solar Connect is its complexity in terms of technology integration and its scale within the grid. Solar Connect is reflective of the reality of what VPPs might look like in the future: multi-platform and having to integrate into a range of systems.”
Frearson said the nature of the Alice Springs VPP trial represents a unique opportunity and one that could be of great significance to the National Energy Market (NEM).

With a population of about 30,000 and a mix of residential households, commerce and industries, the town has an isolated electrical grid that is of a size and complexity that makes it an ideal testing ground for ideas that could lead to a successful transition to a clean energy future.
“The Alice Springs grid is small compared to the NEM or SWIS (South-West Interconnected System), but it retains all the characteristics of those larger systems,” Freason said. “It has an independent system operator, a separated network operator, competitive generators operating in a market, of sorts, and a competitive retail market using a version of the National Energy Rules. Therefore, it’s complex enough for trials run in Alice Springs to provide learnings applicable elsewhere, but small enough to run trials while limiting risk.
“These trials are critical for the whole of Australia because they will help outline pathways that could be part of future grids across the country.”
Alice Springs’ grid currently includes about 10% renewables generation and faces the challenge set by the Territory government to take that number to 50% by 2030. The challenge includes overcoming high levels of rooftop solar and system strength issues to serve residents in communities spread as far as 130 kilometres from the town.
“Alice Springs has very high levels of solar energy contributing to the overall energy mix,” Frearson said. “More than 25% of houses in Alice Springs have solar PV on their roof, totalling a combined 22MW installed rooftop solar. In particular circumstances, such as during sunny days with low loads, as much as 50% of all power in Alice Springs, and 75% of household demand can be supplied by solar PV systems.”

The response to the Solar Connect project has been positive with more than 120 Expressions of Interest received from residents eager to participate. With at least 50 participants required, about 40 of the applicants are eligible and ready to go while there may be some upgrades required for those which don’t quite meet the necessary criteria.
The trial will represent about 300-400kW of rooftop PV capacity while batteries will provide 250-350kW of instantaneous power and 400–500kWh of storage capacity.
Newcastle-based energy management software company Switchdin will deliver the technology platform that links the solar and battery systems.
SwitchDin founder and chief executive officer Andrew Mears said VPPs are critical for ensuring the stability of the grid, to reduce households’ reliance on grid electricity and to optimise the return on investment in rooftop solar and home batteries.
“SwitchDin has worked with major energy retailers across Australia to create VPPs using Stormcloud. What we’re doing with the Solar Connect VPP is another example of how our technology is being used to optimise the rooftop solar and home batteries for the benefit of the grid, households and communities that are connected to the grid,” he said.
Mears said Solar Connect had presented some unique challenges, including the regulatory, commercial, geographical and technical conditions in which the VPP is being developed.

“Unlike other VPPs that are designed around home batteries for demand response programs, the Solar Connect VPP is focused on both the management of solar inverters as well as battery storage systems,” he said. “SwitchDin has integration partnerships with over 20 solar and battery inverter brands and will be working with a diverse range of assets simultaneously. The approach that the Future Grid VPP is taking puts the customers’ choice first by allowing homeowners who are enrolling for the trial with solar inverters and home batteries from a range of brands and solar systems that have been installed at different periods of time.
“We could be integrating a brand-new solar system or a system that might be a few years old and this is a unique situation.”
Mears said the company will be integrating with Fronius, SMA, Sungrow and in the near future, Redback inverters, using both SwitchDin Droplet and Cloud Droplet API connections.
“We are expecting households with more than 15 different inverter models to be enrolled,” he said. “This makes it a really diverse environment.”
The Solar Connect VPP trial is expected to commence in July with full capability expected to be achieved by the end of the calendar year. The trial is expected to continue for 12 months.
Findings from the Solar Connect VPP, and other research activities of Future Grid, will be considered for inclusion in the Alice Springs Roadmap to 2030 report which will iden­ti­fy­ how the Alice Springs electricity grid could operate with 50% renewables by the end of the decade.

CHN Energy has connected a 100 MW floating solar plant to the grid in China’s Zhejiang province. The array is linked to the country’s largest tidal energy project, near the city of Wenling.
The Jiangxia Experimental Tidal Power Station was commissioned in 1980 and is the fourth-largest system of its kind in the world. It consists of six dual-way tidal power generators with a combined capacity of 4.1 MW.
CHN Energy said it used unspecified bifacial solar modules for the projects. It also uses UAV inspection technology and an artificial intelligence diagnosis system to remotely monitor the PV installation.
The facility is owned and operated by Longyuan Power, which is a partially owned subsidiary of state-owned China Energy Investment.
CHN Energy said the solar plant will have an annual power generation of 100 million kWh. It will meet the energy demand of around 30,000 residents. Howver, the company did not provide any additional technical or financial details about the project.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/02/storing-hydropower-via-regenerative-braking-in-electric-trucks/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 2, 2022",Storing hydropower via regenerative braking in electric trucks,"From pv magazine Global
An international research group led by Austria’s International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) has developed an energy storage technique based on the use of electric trucks for hydropower generation at high altitudes.
“Electric truck hydropower” (ETH) involves the transport of water from small streams at high altitudes in electricity truck containers that can transform it into electricity via regenerative braking. Regenerative braking is an energy recovery mechanism that takes the wasted energy from the process of slowing down a vehicle and uses it to recharge batteries.
The system can reduce electricity consumption and also lower a vehicle’s braking load. The scientists said the electricity stored in the vehicles via this process could be sold to the grid or used by trucks for transport purposes.
“The ideal configuration of the ETH system is in mountainous regions with steep roads, where the same electrical trucks can be used to generate hydropower from different sites. This increases the chances that there will be water available to generate hydropower and thus increases the capacity factor of the system,” the scientists said.
They added that the system would have a minimal impact on a river’s aquatic life, as the water collected at high altitudes could be returned to the same river once the trucks have reached the bottoms of hills.
“The reservoirs of this system are containers parked close to a river stream on the mountain, which are filled up with water extracted from the river,” they said. “After the container is filled up, it is ready to be transported down the mountain and to generate hydropower.”
The system would include an electric truck, water containers, a charge site, and a discharge site. The truck driver would have to control the descending speed of the filled truck to produce electricity. After vehicles reach discharge sites and empty their tanks into rivers, discharged batteries could replace charged batteries to restart the cycle.
“The battery is not fully discharged, as the truck requires energy to drive up the mountain with an empty container,” the researchers said. “The discharge site should have a robust connection to the national grid to allow the site to supply electricity to the grid.”
Some locations in the Andes or the Himalayas have the potential to generate 15 TWh per year through this technology, the scientists claimed.
“The continent with the highest potential is Asia with 617 TWh, South America with 466 TWh, Central America with 65 TWh, Europe with 56 TWh, Africa with 17 TWh, North America with 5 TWh, and Australia with 0.7 TWh,” they said. “The global potential for ETH is estimated to be 1226 TWh.”
They estimated the capex of ETH projects at between US$200/kW and $500/kW, or US$30/MWh to $100/MWh. Conventional hydropower plants would come in at US$1,000/kW and $5,000/kW or US$50/MWh to $200/MWh, they claimed.
“Given that the ETH system is already a competitive electricity generation alternative with existing technology, its cost is expected to further reduce with expected technological improvements in the near future,” the scientists said.
The academics presented their findings in “Electric Truck Hydropower, a flexible solution to hydropower in mountainous regions,” which was recently published in Energy. The group includes researchers from Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, the Federal University of Espírito Santo, the University of São Paulo, the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Aalto University, Aarhus University School of Business and Social Sciences, the University of Oxford, and the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences.
