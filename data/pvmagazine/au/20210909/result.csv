Deputy Premier Steven Miles released the Queensland Government Infrastructure Pipeline (QGIP) in Brisbane on Thursday, pointing to continued investment in large-scale renewable energy capacity and outlining potential future proposals currently under development by the state government.
“We have a pipeline of infrastructure projects that are creating jobs and boosting our economic recovery,” Miles said.
“The Queensland Government Infrastructure Pipeline includes more than 1000 projects in delivery and planning and will provide industry with further confidence to invest in Queensland.
“In 2021-22, $14.7 billion – one of the largest capital programs in recent years – has been allocated.”
Included in the 2021-22 spend is $39.9 million to establish five community-scale, grid-connected battery energy storage systems and more than $580 million for augmentation and asset replacement works.
Miles also reaffirmed the government’s $145 million commitment to establish three Renewable Energy Zones (REZ) across southern, central and northern Queensland. Included in the investment is $40 million to upgrade network infrastructure in the Northern REZ with the coastal circuit transmission line between Cairns and Townsville to be upgraded from a 132 kV line to a 275 kV line.
The upgrades are expected to unlock up to 500 MW of renewable energy capacity for the region and make it easier for projects, including the 157 MW Kaban Wind Farm and associated 100 MW battery project, to connect to the National Electricity Market (NEM).
Miles said continued development of the southern and central REZs will coordinate network infrastructure development and new renewable energy generation.
“Our renewable energy zones will unlock the next wave of large renewable energy investment developing Queensland into a renewables, hydrogen, and manufacturing superpower,” he said.
“This will enable efficient investment, deliver local benefits, support the creation of clean energy jobs and support progress toward the government’s 50% renewable energy by 2030 target.”
Renewables already play a major in Queensland’s energy mix, providing more than 20% of electricity generated in the state.

The QGIP shows there are 34 renewable energy plants already operating in Queensland with another 10 projects financially committed or under construction.
The state government said this represents about $10 billion in investment and more than 7,000 construction jobs but Solar Citizens’ energy strategist Stephanie Gray said there is plenty of scope for growth.
“Thousands of people are already employed in Queensland’s renewable energy sector, from rooftop solar installers, technology developers, and construction workers,” she said.
“But this sector is just getting started. As we move towards a decarbonised economy, we’ll need to produce three times more electricity than we generate now to power things like electric cars.
“The demand for abundant and cheap renewable energy is only going to grow and so are the jobs in this space.”
Gray pointed to the growing role advanced manufacturing and minerals processing could play in the state’s economy as the world’s appetite for low-carbon products grows.
“North Queensland has some of the world’s best solar resources and critical mineral deposits needed as the world rolls out more electric transport and battery storage,” she said. “This means we can not only ship minerals overseas, but also use abundant cheap renewable energy to process and manufacture here.”
According to the report, Australia is supplying nearly half of the world’s lithium ore at a value of about $130 million but does not supply any of the refined product suitable for battery cells. The value of that product is estimated to be approximately $2.2 billion.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/09/melbourne-ranked-among-worlds-top-cities-for-rooftop-solar/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2021",Melbourne ranked among world’s top cities for rooftop solar,"Melbourne’s widespread take-up of rooftop solar PV has been highlighted by a team from the National University of Singapore (NUS) which has developed an automated tool that allows researchers and policymakers to study how cities worldwide are greening their rooftops and using them for solar installations.
Roofpedia is an open registry of satellite imagery and data of sustainable rooftops across 17 of the world’s most famous cities with Melbourne the only Australian city included in the initial data set. Other cities included are Berlin, Copenhagen, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Luxembourg City, New York, Paris, Phoenix, Portland, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Singapore, Vancouver, and Zurich.
Roofpedia relies on software that identifies sustainable roof typologies from satellite images and buildings identified with solar panels or rooftop greenery are tagged automatically.
The data has been collated to formulate an index which the researchers have used to benchmark the cities in terms of solar PV and green roof penetration. The index considers both the area coverage and the number of buildings equipped with solar PV installations and green roofs in a city as a percentage value of the entire area.
Melbourne is ranked fifth out of the 17 cities for rooftop solar adoption, with a score of 74 out of a possible 100. Las Vegas, with a score of 86 headed the solar index with Zurich (score of 81) second.
Singapore and Phoenix tied for third in the solar index with 75 points each, just one ahead of Melbourne.
The Victorian capital, which is ranked among the nation’s rooftop solar hotspots, also finished fifth overall with a score of 43 having only scored 11 in the green index.
Zurich scored a perfect 100 in the green stakes to finish atop the overall table with a combined 91. Berlin was second overall with a combined 54 despite finishing sixth in the solar stakes with 57.

Lead researcher Abraham Wu said the scoring system considers both building count and total building area, thus allowing users to study the degree of adoption by individual owners as well as the overall extent of rooftop solar and vegetation cover in other cities.
Wu said the unique characteristics of each city, including the geolocation and climate also play a part in determining the exact benefit of greenery or solar panels on rooftops.
Filip Biljecki, from the NUS School of Design and Environment, said most previous studies have focused on estimating the potential of rooftops whereas Roofpedia “enables us to understand the current and actual status of the rooftops, how many of them are currently occupied with solar panels and/or extensive greenery”.
“By collecting such data, Roofpedia allows us to gauge how cities might further utilise their rooftops to mitigate carbon emissions and how much untapped potential their roofscapes have,” he said.
“For example, users might complement Roofpedia with other sources of data to study the effectiveness of governmental subsidies and whether climate pledges of others have been followed.
“In addition, by collecting current data through satellite imagery, users can more accurately determine the present carbon offsetting capacity of cities as well.”
The research team has made Roofpedia’s data openly accessible in the hope that other researchers will help expand the database by tracking more cities or including other environmental indicators.

Biljecki said the accuracy of Roofpedia’s results would depend on the quality and period of satellite images provided as well as whether the approach would distinguish other man-made features (such as skylights) from solar panels.
“Our project is designed to be open as cities today are dynamic and rapidly adopting sustainable instruments. In addition, its design is modular, meaning that new geographies, roof typologies, and functions can be added,” he said.
“As such, our research group is planning to add a temporal feature so that users can study the evolution of sustainable rooftop measures over time and how much more cities might increase their roofscapes.
“We hope that our work can aid researchers, local governments, and the public in understanding and promoting the further use of rooftops in achieving sustainable urban development for a carbon neutral world.”

Swiss start-up SolarXplorers is currently developing the world’s first PV-powered stratospheric plane, at the Payerne military airfield in Switzerland.
Called Solarstratos, the aircraft measures 8.5m in length and 24.8m in wingspan and has a total weight of 450kg. It is covered with 22m2 of solar panels totalling 5 kW that will power an electric motor connected to lithium-ion batteries to ensure its operation.
To reach the announced 25,000m altitude, the aircraft is powered by a three-bladed propeller and a 2×19 kW double electric motor which is entirely powered by solar energy. The PV system is based on solar cells with an efficiency of between 22 and 24%. The photovoltaic cells were integrated directly into the wings by the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM), a scientific partner of the project.
The cells were deployed in series or in parallel, to ensure their electrical insulation. This, according to the airplane developers, makes them more resistant to external factors such as humidity, rain, snow or corrosion, and even mechanical shocks.
The solar cells power the device’s lithium-ion batteries, which have a total capacity of 14 kWh, expandable to 21 kWh.
To limit the weight of the aircraft, the aircraft is not pressurised and the pilot must be equipped with a spacesuit specially designed for the project, and which also operates on solar energy. It was the Russian space supplier Zvezda which developed the technology for this suit, which combines several innovations to regulate temperature and pressure, and to protect the pilot from solar exposure.
The fuselage and wings are constructed of carbon fibre with a large wingspan that allows the aircraft to fly at reduced speed. “SolarStratos will stay in the stratosphere for a while, consuming nothing other than unlimited solar energy and, above all, totally clean,” said Philippe Pilloud, who is in charge of operations and flight safety. “This is Icarus’ dream, but in this case the sun will be an ally and no longer an enemy.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/09/what-seawater-and-salt-spray-can-do-to-a-pv-system/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,CHINA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2021",What seawater and salt spray can do to a PV system,"From pv magazine Global
A group of Chinese scientists has simulated the effects of the marine environment on the performance of PV systems installed on large ocean-going cargo ships and has found that there are differences between the effects of salt spray and seawater on the panels’ electrical output characteristics.
The researchers explained that the marine environment has a strong influence on the module surface, via salt and water vapour mixed with acid and basic substances, noting that previous research focused mainly on the damage caused by seawater corrosion and salt particles. “Under seawater corrosion, black spots of corrosion on the surface of the glass of PV modules are formed, with further decrease of the spectral transmittance and [they can] even cause irreparable physical damage,” they stated. “Although the marine environment is highly corrosive, it takes a long time for tempered glass to be severely corroded. It may be more urgent to pay attention to the influence of marine environmental factors on the electrical output characteristics of the PV module.”
The impact of salt spray and seawater on a PV system is described by the academics as a dynamic process through which salt spray creates a  layer on the module, thus forming a water film on its surface. “At the same time, the seawater will also cover the surface of the PV module,” they emphasised. “When the salt spray and seawater evaporate, the salt particles are left on the surface of the glass cover plate.”
The Chinese group built an experimental platform consisting of a main workbox, a sample holder, a modular lighting system, and a water circulation system. Mini solar panels, with a power output of 10 W each, were placed horizontally on the sample holder and humidity, radiation, and temperature sensors were used to collect environmental parameters. Artificial seawater with a concentration of 3.5% and a pH value of 8.2 was used for the experiment. The performance of the PV system was evaluated through the tester PROVA210.
Through their analysis, the scientists found that the solar irradiation hitting the module surface was considerably lowered after the salt spray was sprayed. “This weakening effect has a stronger impact on the electrical output of the PV modules than the positive effect brought by cooling, resulting in the decreasing power output,” they highlighted.
When no more salt spray was sprayed, the solar radiation levels on the panels increased again, which shows, they went on to say, that the effect of salt spray is greater on solar irradiance than on temperature. “The combined influence of water spray on the electrical output characteristics of [a] PV module manifests as a maximum power reduction of about 6%,” the research team further explained. “When the PV modules are used in inland rivers, and other areas with easy-to-condense water, the water mist generated in the environment will also have a similar influence on the electrical output characteristics.”
When analysing the effect of seawater, the researchers found that it has a significant cooling effect due to evaporation and heat absorption, and those can even raise the module yield by up to 20%. When the water evaporates, however, salt crystals gradually attach to the module surface and this makes solar irradiance spread uniformly on the glass cover.
“As a material with a low thermal conductivity, salt particles block the heat transfer of [the] PV module, making it difficult for the PV module to release its own heat, leading to a temperature rise,” they added, noting that the salt particles also weaken the light transmission of the module as a whole. “Although the cooling effect of seawater attached to the surface of [a] PV module is obvious, it will be temporary if there is no subsequent seawater scouring.”
The combined influence of salt particles, as a heating agent and a factor reducing solar radiation, resulted in a 10% yield reduction for the experimental PV system.
The scientists concluded that more research is needed to understand completely the dynamics of the coexistence between salt spray and seawater. “The resulting changes to the PV module output are often very complex, and it can lead to increases or decreases in the PV module output,” they stated. “Meanwhile, considering the rain, salinity of seawater, and other factors, the salt deposition will be slower, which will also affect the PV module output.”
The experimental set-up was presented in the paper Effects of marine environment on electrical output characteristics of PV module, which was recently published in the Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy. The research group comprises scientists from the Wuhan University of Technology and China’s National Engineering Research Center for Water Transport Safety (WTS Center).
