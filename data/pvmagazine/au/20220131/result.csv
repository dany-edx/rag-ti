https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/31/nsw-declares-massive-8-gw-renewable-energy-zone/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 31, 2022",NSW declares massive 8 GW renewable energy zone,"Australia’s largest planned Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) is to be built in the New South Wales (NSW) northeast with the state government announcing the New England REZ, which will deliver at least 8 GW of new network capacity, has been formally declared.
The declaration of the New England REZ is the first step in formalising the coordinated energy zone under the Electricity Infrastructure Investment Act 2020. It sets out the intended network capacity, geographical area and infrastructure that will make up the New England REZ which is centred on the northern city of Armidale and extends west towards Uralla and east to Ebor and takes in Walcha to the south and Glenn Innes to the north.
Energy Corporation of NSW chief executive officer James Hay said the state government is powering ahead and meeting major milestones on its Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap with this REZ, which follows the declaration of the Central-West Orana REZ in November.
“REZs are the modern-day equivalent of a power station, combining low-cost renewables with back-up energy from storage and transmission to deliver cheap, reliable and clean energy,” he said.
“It’s phenomenal to get this REZ declared as New England has some of the best natural energy resources in the country, including some of the state’s best potential sites for pumped-hydro and strong investor interest.”

Energy Minister Matt Kean said the 8 GW New England REZ is the biggest commitment to cheap, clean energy in the state’s history with the NSW Government committing to invest $78.9 million to support its development.
“The New England REZ is a fundamental part of our Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap and we expect it will deliver up to 8,000 megawatts of new capacity, $10.7 billion in private investment, around 830 operational jobs and 1,250 construction jobs to the local economy,” he said in a statement.
“The New England REZ will be able to power 3.5 million homes and, when coupled with Central-West Orana REZ, sets the state up to become the number one destination across Australia for renewable energy investment.”
The New England REZ is set to become the nation’s largest energy zone with a call for registrations of interest (ROI) last year attracting more than 80 new solar, wind and energy storage projects, totalling a massive 34 GW.
Kean said the response to the ROI process showed huge investor confidence in the state’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap with more than four times the level of interest needed to build out the planned 8 GW REZ.
“The overwhelming response shows this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to attract enormous investment into regional areas, cementing NSW’s renewable energy future,” he said.
The New England region has already attracted a host of large-scale wind and solar projects, including the Walcha Energy Project, a 4 GW wind, solar and pumped hydro energy storage hub put forward by Energy Estate and its partners.

Joint venture UPC/AC Renewables Australia has commenced construction of the first 400 MW stage of the New England Solar Farm while Spanish developer Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV) is progressing with the 115 MW Metz Solar Farm.
The state-owned Energy Corporation of NSW (EnergyCo) has been appointed as the infrastructure planner for the New England REZ and will coordinate the generation, firming, storage and transmission projects leading the delivery of the state’s REZs.
Hay said EnergyCo has and will continue to work with a range of stakeholders in the New England region to deliver the REZ in a way that considers local priorities and values, land use planning, investor interest and the legislative requirements.
“This is great news for the region as the REZ will help drought-proof traditional farming communities and provide new income streams for landholders that host electricity infrastructure,” he said.
“It is estimated that in the New England REZ, this could amount to around $660 million in lease payments for landholders to 2042.
“REZs will also play a key role in delivering on our commitment to halve the state’s emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero by 2050.”

The New England REZ is one of five designated clean energy areas detailed in the NSW Government’s electricity roadmap, which is anticipated will support more than $32 billion of investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission in the state.
REZs will also be developed in the Central-West Orana, South-West, Hunter-Central Coast and Illawarra regions and are expected to bring 12 GW of renewable energy and 2 GW of storage online ahead of the planned retirement of the coal-reliant state’s aging thermal-generation fleet with four of its five fossil-fuelled power plants expected to close in the next 15 years, starting with Liddell in 2023-24.
The Central-West Orana REZ, which is tipped to deliver 3 GW of renewable energy, was the first of the REZs to be launched with the call for ROIs last year attracting 113 registrations, totalling 27 GW and valued at $38 billion.
The state government has also invited ROIs from renewable generators, energy storage and network developers, and existing and proposed energy loads, to participate in shaping the South-West REZ, which is centred on the inland town of Hay and extends west to Buronga and east to the fringes of Griffith.
The New England REZ will be built in stages, with the delivery timetable to be developed throughout the planning process.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/31/zenith-plans-industry-first-renewable-feat-for-wa-mine/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 31, 2022",Solar expansion at WA mine to deliver 100% renewables in daylight hours,"Perth-based Zenith Energy has announced it will install additional solar PV and battery storage capacity at IGO’s Nova nickel-copper-cobalt operation in West Australia’s Goldfield region, allowing the mine to be powered continuously by on-site renewables for up to nine hours at a time.
The Nova site, in the Fraser Range about 360 kilometres southeast of Kalgoorlie, is currently powered by a 26 MW hybrid solar PV-diesel plant, including a 6.7 MW solar array. The addition of another 10 MW of solar capacity and the installation of a 10 MWh battery energy storage system is expected to allow for 100% renewable power generation during daylight hours, weather permitting.
Zenith, which owns and operates the existing hybrid power plant, said the deployment of additional solar generation and energy storage will be key to achieving ‘engine off’, storing sufficient power to ensure supply and reliability of the system is not compromised.
Zenith’s executive manager of growth, Dominic Da Cruz, said the project will require the integration of “specific technology into the power system to provide inertia and stability, ensuring a continuous, reliable supply of power”.
“While there are currently non-industrial micro-grids operating on 100% renewables, the Nova project will prove it’s possible to use 100% renewables to meet the demands of an operational mine site,” he said.
“It will also prove the ability for sites to go ‘engine off’ for consecutive hours, without interruption to supply.”
Da Cruz said the Nova project will also demonstrate that 100% renewable energy penetration can be sustainably achieved and replicated on other sites across Australia now, without having to wait for further advancements in technology.
“This project sends a strong message to the industry that powering an entire site completely on renewables is possible today,” he said.
“For sites where renewables are already part of the power generation system, where land permits, increasing renewable assets to go ‘engine off’ is a natural next step on the pathway to net zero.”
Fellow Western Australian energy company Hybrid Systems Australia (HSA) has already demonstrated that powering an industrial site with 100% renewables during daylight hours is achievable.
In late 2020 HSA installed a 1.2 MW solar farm, a 2 MW diesel power station and a 350 kWh lithium-ion battery at environmental services company Tellus’s  Sandy Ridge mine and waste facility near Kalgoorlie. The system was switched on in December 2020 and the facility is being 100% powered by renewable energy during daytime operations, thanks to a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA).

Da Cruz said while Nova will continue to rely on diesel-generated power overnight and during inclement weather conditions, he is confident the industry is approaching a tipping point where 100% renewable power generation will be possible 24 hours a day.
“Zenith is already looking at what subsequent steps are needed to achieve this ultimate goal, including how we facilitate higher levels of renewable penetration, and integration of long-duration storage,” he said.
“It’s an exciting time not just for Zenith as a company, but for the entire industry. We’re making real progress in the decarbonization space and what that might look like for the sector moving forward.”
IGO chief operating officer Matt Dusci said the project is an important next step in the miner’s journey towards carbon neutrality and sets a new “benchmark” for the resources industry.
“We are now at a point where technology and cost structure are enabling powering of an entire mining operation with 100% renewable penetration,” he said.
“By supporting greater uses of renewable energy at our Nova operation, it will set a new industry benchmark in renewable energy integration and demonstrates our commitment to decarbonise our business.”
The existing Nova solar farm has been operational since 2019 and last year provided more than 11% of the mining operation’s total power consumption, displacing about 2,444 kilolitres of diesel and eliminating 6,600 tonnes of carbon.

Zenith, which signed its original power purchase agreement (PPA) with IGO in October 2018, said the expansion project will also highlight the benefits of relocatable renewables with re-deployable modular solar technology provided by Sydney-based manufacturer 5B expected to be used.
Once Zenith’s tenure at Nova ends, the solar panels and battery energy storage system are set to be relocated to another site in what will be “the first practical demonstration at scale of relocatable renewable energy”.
“Proving this will assist in reducing barriers to capital expenditure, as renewable assets are used in multiple locations over their life span,” Zenith said in a statement. “It will also fast-track deployment of solar and further emission reductions across Zenith’s legacy portfolio.”
The announcement comes after IGO signed an agreement with Perth-based energy storage company VSUN Energy to trial a hybrid standalone power system (SPS) backed by a vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) at the Nova site.
VSUN Energy, a subsidiary of Australian Vanadium Limited (AVL), will install a SPS based on a 300 kWh VRFB supplied by Spanish battery manufacturer E22.
AVL said the new SPS, which will be used to power a bore pump on-site, has been designed to provide a 100% renewable energy supply for much of the year, although the initial 12-month trial will target a total renewable penetration of 85-90%.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/31/australian-firm-targets-mongolia-for-green-hydrogen-project/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,MONGOLIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 31, 2022",Australian firm targets Mongolia for green hydrogen project,"Adelaide-headquartered Elixir Energy has announced it has achieved progress on multiple fronts for its proposed Gobi H2 green hydrogen project in Mongolia, including the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to support project finance.
ASX-listed Elixir, whose strategy rests on the view that the Gobi region is one the of best locations in the world for producing and exporting green hydrogen, given its renewable resources and immediate proximity to likely hydrogen markets, said it had executed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Mongolia Green Finance Corporate (MGFC) as it seeks to progress its renewable energy ambitions.
Under the MoU, the two entities will work together to identify carbon offset opportunities to reduce exploration and appraisal stage scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions, develop larger scale forestry and nature related offsets, and work with international financial institutions over the project financing of Gobi H2.
Elixir managing director Neil Young said the company is pleased to be working with the Mongolian government to investigate the world-class green hydrogen potential of the country which is bordered by Russia to the north and China to the south.
Elixir, which operates in Mongolia and the United States, said it would also seek to work with the Mongolian government and other potential stakeholders to bring forward Australia’s expertise in the nascent hydrogen economy in technical, commercial and legal areas.
“All the work we are doing on our Gobi H2 project serves to reinforce our original starting concept: the country is a potential tier-one location for large-scale hydrogen exports,” Young said.
“Elixir’s first-mover advantages are being progressively locked in and it is fantastic to see the rapidly growing interest in this future-facing industry from multiple local and international stakeholders.”

The signing of the MoU follows Elixir’s recently commissioned independent report from energy analyst K1 Capital which evaluated the wind and solar resource potential of the South Gobi region for the production of green hydrogen.
The report estimates the project location has a combined wind and solar utilisation of 79%, compared to the 60% rate in the Southern Goldfields, and 45% in the Pilbara region in Western Australia. The report said this is underpinned by very high wind speeds, along with a cold climate which could support enhanced solar efficiencies.
Elixir said a location with a capacity factor of 79% will produce about 60% more hydrogen from the same capital investment than an area with a roughly 50% capacity factor.
Young said the company believes Mongolia is “exceptionally” well placed to supply what are predicted to be substantial hydrogen imports.
“The K1 Capital report supports our thesis that the South Gobi region of Mongolia has such potential – not only given its location immediately proximate to markets, but also its superb renewable resources,” he said.
“The wind and solar combination in our project area is as good as we have seen anywhere.”
While Elixir is yet to release details about the size of the proposed project, it late last year acquired the 50 MW Solar Ilch solar project being developed in the South Gobi desert by Mongolian investment firm Nova Terra and Thailand-based solar project developer Symbior Solar.

Elixir said it is now harvesting detailed data for both wind and solar in the region using SODAR (Sonic Detection and Ranging) equipment provided by Sydney-based technology company Fulcrum3D.
Elixir said it has also ordered a solar-focused monitoring unit from Fulcrum3D that will be deployed at the Solar Lich solar farm. It will be installed to provide data that will assist project funding capacity.
“The acquisition of Solar Ilch is a material step in the implementation of our relatively recently announced hydrogen strategy, but is only one of a good number of moves we are making on this front,” Young said.
Elixir said a concept stage study has also been commissioned from Australian engineering firm GPA Engineering for a pilot project to supply green hydrogen to Inner Mongolian steel mills in China.
The company said it has also initiated a commercial study with international energy consulting firm Rystad Energy into China’s long-term hydrogen demand and supply.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/31/ausnet-shareholders-overwhelmingly-approve-18-billion-sale/,"FINANCE,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,CANADA,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 31, 2022",AusNet shareholders overwhelmingly approve $18 billion sale,"AusNet Services shareholders have voted in favour of a resolution to sell the electricity transmission network owner to a consortium led by Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management with the estimated $18 billion deal receiving huge investor support at a shareholders meeting on Friday.
AusNet owns and operates the majority of Victoria’s transmission network infrastructure, as well as a large proportion of the state’s electricity and gas distribution network.
While listed on the ASX, AusNet is already majority foreign owned, with 32% controlled by the Singapore government’s investment fund Temasek through its company Singapore Power, while another 19.9% stake is owned by China’s State Grid Corporation.
The Brookfield consortium, which includes pension funds Sunsuper, Alberta Investment Management Corporation, the Investment Management Corporation of Ontario and Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan, has said it sees AusNet as a “multi-decade investment pivotal to Australia’s clean energy transition”.
AusNet chair Peter Mason said the sale had been approved by the requisite majority of shareholders with 99.76% of votes cast at Friday’s meeting in favour of the resolution.
“The AusNet Board is pleased to announce the very positive outcome in the Scheme Meeting,” he said in a statement.
“The 99.76% of votes in favour of the Scheme is the result of a competitive process and underscores the board’s work to maximise value for shareholders.
“We would like to thank our shareholders, in particular our major shareholders Singapore Power and State Grid, for their engagement in the scheme process and support for AusNet over the years.”
Brookfield’s all-cash offer of $2.65 a share had already won the unanimous support of AusNet’s board of directors.
Australia gas giant APA Group had tried to outbid the Brookfield consortium, but failed to secure the required support for its takeover on the promise of preventing Victoria’s power grid becoming completely foreign-owned.
The sale remains subject to approval by the New South Wales Supreme Court.
The mandatory second hearing is scheduled for Thursday, 3 February. If the court approves the scheme, AusNet said in a statement it will lodge a copy of the court orders with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on Friday, at which time the scheme will become legally effective.
AusNet’s takeover comes less than a month after the long-awaited sale of grid-operator Spark Infrastructure to a North American consortium led by private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has been completed via a $5.2 billion “all-cash transaction”.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/31/mounting-system-for-agrivoltaics/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,GERMANY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 31, 2022",Mounting system for agrivoltaics,"From pv magazine Global
Chinese mounting system provider Mibet has developed a mounting structure for agrivoltaic projects that can be applied to different crops.
The structure is claimed to ensure different light transmittance levels and enable several PV system layouts in order to meet developers’ needs for different crop growth and to create the appropriate environment for different crops in a flexible way.
“The main body of the Mibet Agri-PV system adopts aluminium alloy and large-span structure, so it won’t impede the daily operation of the agricultural machinery,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The columns can be adapted to different projects, multiple square tubes can be switched seamlessly, and it boasts excellent bearing performance even with the large span structure.”
The patented T-shape slot together with the column, the joint, and the rear diagonal tension brace enables the flexible adjustment of greenhouse mountings, reducing the installation time in an efficient way, according to the manufacturer. “The Mibet Agri-PV system has passed the professional tests of Germany’s TÜV and acquired the certificates for a minimum service life of 25 years,” the spokesperson added.
The system offers a tilt angle of up to 30 degrees and can host either framed or frameless solar modules. The panels can be deployed with a portrait or landscape design.
The mounting structure is usually sold in silver but the colour can be customised according to the customers’ needs. Its wind load is 80 m/s and the slow load 160 KN/m2. The product comes with a 10-year warranty.
