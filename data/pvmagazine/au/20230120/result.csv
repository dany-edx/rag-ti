The Merredin Solar Farm, acquired by Singapore-headquartered Surya Utama Nuansa (SUN) Energy from original developer Risen Energy in October 2021, was also ranked the nation’s top performing large-scale PV asset in 2021.
The facility has the capacity to generate 274 GWh of clean energy per annum and has been exporting at full capacity to the South West Interconnected System since August 2020.
While the Merredin Solar Farm topped the rankings, Adani Australia’s 65 MW Rugby Run Solar Farm  was second for the second year in a row. Dixon said the facility, near Moranbah in central Queensland, returned an AC CF of 28.5% for the calendar year.
Bright Energy Investments’ 40 MW Greenough River Solar Farm near Geraldton in WA’s Midwest placed third in the large-scale solar stakes with an AC CF of 28.0% while Genex’s 50 KW Kidston Solar Farm in north Queensland was fourth. Melbourne-based renewables developer Pacific Hydro Australia’s 100 MW Haughton stage 1 Solar Farm in north Queensland rounded out the top five.

The performances of the solar farms were part of a record-breaking year for utility PV and wind generation in Australia.
Dixon said large-scale solar PV and wind generation totalled 41,254 GWh in 2022 with utility PV contributing 11,774 GWh and wind 29,480 GWh. That equated to a 16% rise on the previous year (35,564 GWh).
At a state level, Victoria was the largest generator of utility PV and wind generation in 2022 (11,248 GWh), followed by New South Wales (11,112 GWh) and South Australia in third (7,260 GWh).
Dixon said Queensland was a notable absentee from the top three, given the state target of 80% renewables generation by 2035, up from less than 23% in 2022.

Meanwhile, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has published its latest connections data, showing 23 projects totalling 2.9 GW of new capacity were connected in the National Electricity Market (NEM) in 2022. This was up 137 MW from the 30 projects connected in 2021.
Victoria connected the most new capacity in 2022 with 991 MW comprised entirely of wind farms with no new solar. Queensland followed with 866 MW, made up mostly of large-scale solar, including Neoen’s 400 MW Western Downs Solar Farm.
Solar also dominated the 619 MW of new capacity connected in New South Wales while in Tasmania there were no new connections in 2022.
South Australia welcomed 447 MW of new capacity, including the Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park, which comprised 201 MW of wind and 99 MW of solar connected to the grid.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/20/south-australia-gives-vehicle-to-grid-technology-green-light/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 20, 2023",South Australia gives vehicle-to-grid technology green light,"Electricity provider South Australia Power Networks (SAPN) has launched a trial of bi-directional vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology that lets private electric vehicle (EV) owners in the state charge and discharge their EV, allowing them to power their homes and businesses and also feed excess energy stored in their car battery into the grid.
Melbourne-based EV charging company Jet Charge said it had received approval from SAPN to install the Quasar bi-directional charger developed by Spanish firm Wallbox. The technology enables two-way power exchanges, effectively turning EVs into mobile batteries, provided the car is equipped with V2G or vehicle-to-home (V2H) capabilities.
Jet Charge Chief Executive Officer Tim Washington said the “ground-breaking” two-way technology transforms a vehicle into a mobile energy storage solution, at once capable of meeting both transport and property energy needs, while also able to export excess energy to the grid.
“This is a monumental milestone for our industry,” Washington said. “V2G technology will transform how we view electric vehicles and holds the key to zero cost mobility.”
SAPN Head of Corporate Affairs Paul Roberts said smart chargers and connections will also provide utilities with access to renewable energy that they can use to manage energy flows securely while avoiding the need for large-scale investment in additional network capacity.
“This is very much part of the future where customers invest in various energy sources such as rooftop solar, home batteries and vehicle batteries and are more active participants in the supply and management of electricity,” Roberts said.
“In the long term we see people taking advantage of cheap energy during the day to charge their vehicles and then being able to sell that energy back into the grid at peak times when it may be needed.”

South Australia is the only jurisdiction in Australia that has provided approval for EV chargers to be installed in bidirectional mode in residential settings but the technology has been trialled there and elsewhere.
South Australia’s Flinders University last year installed 20 V2G chargers to fully utilise the battery capacity of its growing EV fleet while in 2020 the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) backed a trial of the technology in the Australian Capital Territory. The Realising Electric Vehicle-to-Grid Services (REVS) project utilised a fleet of 51 Nissan Leaf vehicles to explore the ability of EVs to provide frequency regulation services to the National Electricity Market (NEM).
Jet Charge said it is looking to have V2G technology deployed nationally and is actively working with the appropriate distribution network service providers and regulatory bodies to obtain the required approvals.
“South Australia’s leadership in approving the first V2G charging station in Australia is promising and we look forward to other states and territories following suit,” Washington said.
Residents in South Australia are now able to submit an application to SAPN to install a Quasar V2G charger. If approved, they will be eligible to purchase the charger from Jet Charge for about $10,000, excluding installation costs, with the company opening orders later this month for the next shipment of units.

The first of the Wallbox Quasar chargers has already been installed at the Ballycroft Vineyard and Cellars in the Barossa Valley where owner Joseph Evans has used the V2G technology alongside rooftop solar to not only eliminate his power bill, but profit from the energy he feeds back into the grid.
Evans said his Nissan Leaf’s 40 kWh battery offers enough range for his daily round-trip to Adelaide, where he makes wine deliveries to restaurants, before recharging the vehicle later that day using rooftop solar. After recharging his vehicle, Evans then uses the stored energy to power his home and property overnight, while also feeding unused energy back into the grid and earning a rebate tariff.
“This is a game-changer,” he said. “I’ve gone from a $6000 annual power bill to making around $50 per week in profit selling my excess power back to the grid.”
“That is more than $2,500 in annual profit, from what was once a significant cost. Instead of paying for my power, I’m getting paid for my power. “

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/20/let-buyers-jump-queue-for-evs-by-importing-them-directly/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JANUARY 20, 2023",Let buyers jump queue for EVs by importing them directly,"The world leader in electric vehicle (EV) uptake is Norway, where 87.6% of new cars (including 4.8% plug-in hybrids) are electric. Australia’s figure is also far lower than in Europe (27.7%, including 10.4% plug-in hybrids), China (35%, 25% fully electric) or even the United States (7.1%, 5.8% fully electric).
However, even in Norway the proportion of cars on the road that are electric – although impressive compared to the rest of the world – is still only 20%. This difference reflects the time it takes to replace an existing fleet of internal combustion engine cars.

Why has Australia done so badly? The overt hostility of the previous government to electric vehicles can’t have helped. Prime Minister Scott Morrison even claimed Labor wanted to “abolish the weekend” with its electric vehicle policy.
But the Morrison government has been gone for the better part of a year now and electric vehicle sales, while growing, remain very low.
The two core issues faced by Australians wanting to buy electric vehicles are affordability and lack of availability. Despite some recent modest price reductions, Teslas are priced out of reach of most private car buyers. They also face long delivery delays. Would-be buyers of many other brands face similar problems.
Australian governments have done little, if anything, to encourage the transition to electric vehicles. Almost uniquely among developed countries, Australia has neither a carbon price nor vehicle fuel-efficiency standards.
The Victorian state government even taxes electric and hybrid vehicles for their road use. South Australia had a similar tax, but has abolished it.
There have been a few positive measures, mostly at the state level. Although the federal government has legislated an exemption from fringe benefits tax, it offers no direct benefit to individual car buyers. The government’s development of a national EV strategy may lead to other initiatives.
But incentives don’t make much difference if it is impossible to buy a vehicle. Until recently, delivery delays could be explained as part of general COVID-related disruptions and restrictions introduced to control the pandemic.
But those restrictions are mostly gone now, and remaining supply disruptions haven’t stopped millions of European and Chinese buyers from getting behind the wheel.
1/16/23: Electric-vehicle sales surged worldwide last year, driven mainly by strong growth in China and Europe. 2022 global sales of EVs totaled about 7.8 million units – an increase of 68% from 2021. In 2022 every 4th vehicle sold in China was electric.🚘 https://t.co/YCxVY0f2ye

A critical problem is that the Australian retail motor industry has a structure designed for the 20th century, when a small number of locally made cars, powered by internal combustion engines, dominated the roads. Retailers, typically franchisees for one of the major manufacturers, provided not only a distribution channel, but highly profitable after-sales service.
With the end of Australian manufacturing, this no longer makes a lot of sense. The requirement to buy through an authorised dealer, like other systems of this kind, allows overseas producers to raise car prices for Australian consumers, with few offsetting benefits. They can also supply the market with fuel-inefficient models.
The problem is even worse for electric vehicles. Compared to vehicles with internal combustion engines, electric vehicles have many fewer moving parts and much less need for costly servicing.
The most important component, the battery, has an estimated life of up to 20 years. There’s no transmission, spark plugs, timing belt or air filter to worry about. Profits on all of these items enable car dealers to reduce the sticker price on fossil-fuelled vehicles, making them much easier to sell.
Electric vehicle maintenance costs are ~40% lower than those for internal combustion engine vehicles. And here are where the savings come from:

One step towards solving this problem would be to allow consumers to import new and used cars from overseas suppliers. This is known as “parallel importing”.
Consumers have already seen the benefits of parallel importing for items including books, music and a wide variety of consumer goods. In some cases, such as that of books, parallel importing can be done only by individual consumers; in others it is open to firms that wish to compete with existing distribution channels.
Australia is far behind the rest of the world in the transition from fossil-fuelled vehicles. To avoid falling further behind, we need to change the kinds of vehicles we import.
A fuel-efficiency standard would discourage the dirtiest of our current vehicles. While increasing the upfront sale price, it would save drivers money in the long run.
Parallel importing would increase competition in the market for new and used electric vehicles overnight. Manufacturers would have to reconsider their supply and pricing strategies for Australia.
Allowing independent importation would also promote the development of a skilled workforce to service the cars. It could even allow the development of local manufacturing of electric vehicle components.

They are designed for home backup, off-grid applications, and powering small industrial machinery.
The system can be used in combination with solar panels. The 4,000 W power station has a peak power of 6000 W and 2,611 Wh of capacity. It can be fully recharged by a 600 W solar panel in 5.5 hours, according to the company. Other charging options include AC, DC, and USB-C inputs.
“These portable power stations are built around a state-of-the-art solid electrolyte in place of the bulky and flammable liquid electrolyte found in traditional lithium-ion batteries, which improves performance and represents a giant leap forward for battery technology,” Yoshino said in a statement. “Higher energy density means the same amount of power fits into a smaller, lighter package – up to half the weight per watt compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries.”
The smallest battery measures 25.4 cm x 15.5 cm x 24.1 cm and weighs in at 4.58 kg. The largest one measures 54.3 cm x 25.9 cm x 23.8 cm and weighs 24.99 kg. They can reportedly run for 2,500 cycles to 80% capacity.
The 2,000 W and 4,000 W models feature uninterruptible power supply (UPS) when plugged into wall sockets. Yoshino is selling the products starting at USD 349 ($505) retail. They feature a 36-month warranty.
The solution includes a mobile app to monitor charge level, battery health, and connected devices. The entire product range will be available in the U.S. starting in May. There was no mention of if or when the batteries will be made available in Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/20/us-court-rules-in-favour-of-q-cells-in-patent-dispute-with-rec/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JANUARY 20, 2023",US court rules in favour of Q Cells in patent dispute with REC,"In a review process initiated by Hanwha Solutions, the parent of Hanwha Q Cells, the US Patent Trial and Appeal Board declared on 9 December that all contested claims of REC Solar’s US patent No. 10,749,060 (Patent 060) are not patentable. It determined that the challenged REC Solar patent claims are directed to a well-known arrangement of solar components within a solar module, and fail to satisfy the requirements of patentability.
REC challenged Hanwha Solutions in a patent infringement lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware in 2020. The court’s judges suspended the dispute for the duration of the inter partes review procedure. In early January, the deadline was extended again.
Q Cells said in a statement that the U.S .decision follows similar rulings in relation to REC Solar’s global patents. Last year, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court and European Patent Office issued favorable rulings for Hanwha Solutions over a Chinese patent, 201480038577.X, and a European patent, EP3017520. The two patents are related to REC Solar’s 060 patent. However, REC Solar declined to comment when contacted by pv magazine.
In March 2019, Hanwha Q Cells filed patent infringement complaints in Germany against Jinko Solar and REC Group, and followed this with a similar lawsuit against Longi Solar. The complaints claimed that the companies had unlawfully included Q Cells’ patented passivation technology in their own products. In June 2020, the Düsseldorf regional court determined that the three defendants had infringed upon the German part of the patent. The appeal process is still ongoing.
Hanwha Q Cells has also filed patent-related complaints in France, the Netherlands, and the United States. The U.S. Court of Appeals has determined that the complaint over the disputed patent was invalid. The European Patent Office, meanwhile, confirmed the validity of the passivation tech patent in June 2020, with only minor changes.
