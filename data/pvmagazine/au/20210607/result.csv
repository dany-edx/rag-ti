Chinese inverter maker Growatt unveiled a 1,100 V string inverter solution for commercial and utility-scale solar power plants at the SNEC PV Power Expo currently being held in Shanghai.
Called MAX100~125KTL3-X-LV, the transformer-free device is available in four different versions with nominal power of 100 to 125 kW. Efficiency for all devices is 98.8% and European efficiency for the inverters with 110, 120, and 125 kW of power is 98.5%, while the European rating for the 100 kW inverter is 98.4%.
The new product measures 970x640x345mm and has a weight of 84kg. It features up to 10 independent maximum power point tracking (MPPT) inputs, with MPPT voltage ranging from 180-1000 V.
The inverter can be used at a maximum operating altitude of 4,000 meters and its operating ambient temperature ranges from -30 to 60 degrees Celsius. The series also features IP66 enclosures.
“The inverter has 10 MPPTs, allowing for different orientations for solar arrays to optimise solar power generation,” the manufacturer stated. “Its maximum string input current reaches 16A, enabling the inverter to work with 500W+ high power modules.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/07/helping-companies-take-a-smart-path-to-net-zero-and-reliably-account-for-their-impacts/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"JUNE 7, 2021","Helping companies take a smart path to net zero, and reliably account for their impacts","A new division of French energy giant Engie is quietly bringing strategy, engineering and software to bear on the decarbonisation targets of companies in Australia. Engie Impact, a sustainability consulting initiative with 2000 employees globally, has nine in Australia so far, led by Senior Director, Josh Martin.
“We want to be working with companies that face some really challenging decarbonisation problems, and help them find solutions,” the energy strategist told pv magazine Australia.
The recent successful application to ARENA by Yara Pilbara Fertilisers, for funding to test the feasibility of transitioning from natural gas-fed ammonia production to using green-hydrogen as a feedstock for synthesis of green ammonia, was assisted by the Engie Impact team.
“We essentially plotted a range of scenarios through which they could pursue their net-zero goal, and landed on one that had a positive business case for Yara,” says Martin.
The service is available to any company, and Martin says Engie Impact is unique among consultants in bridging the gap between intention and implementation.

Analysis of respondents to the not-for-profit CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project), found that of all the companies that have declared their emissions-reductions goals, only 28% are on track to achieve them.
CDP, operates globally, and was set up in 2020 to make discussion and disclosure of company emissions and emissions challenges the norm. Over the past 20 years, more than 10,000 companies, cities and states have signed up to disclose their environmental risks and impacts.
“If we’re going to align and actually meet the targets of the Paris Agreement, we need everyone to play their part,” says Martin.
As part of its consultation process, Engie Impact deploys its Prosumer simulation tool, developed by Engie Labs, to identify the most cost-effective combination of investments a company can make in decarbonisation technologies — such as energy generation using solar and/or wind, battery energy storage, green hydrogen production and energy efficiency technologies — to accelerate its progress to an emissions-reduction goal.
Martin calls out an example of a more industry-specific technology, Elysis, currently being refined by Rio Tinto and Alcoa, “which is focused on decarbonising aluminium smelting, and completely reworks the process such that instead of producing greenhouse gas emissions, the process emits only oxygen.” Elysis expects its product to reach commercialisation by 2024.
At the end of 2020, Engie Impact, which launched in the APAC region in June last year, announced the completion of its zero-carbon roadmap for Vale New Caledonia (VNC), which produces nickel, primarily for the battery industry, and wants to differentiate itself from competitors with a zero-carbon product.
Under APAC Managing Director of Engie Impact, Malavika Jain Bambawale, the division undertook a study to provide insights into the possible pathways for VNC to achieve zero carbon within two decades, taking into account the expected increase in energy consumption over that period.
It weighed up trade-offs between energy and carbon savings, capital and operational expenditures and return on investment, and leveraged Engie’s expertise in renewables, renewable hydrogen, energy storage and zero-carbon mobility options.
“Working with ENGIE we knew that we would be able to establish how to best innovate our plant to not only reach our intended goal but to also do so competitively,” said VNC Energy Transition Manager, Sylvain David, at the time.
The company had also identified that to ensure an end-to-end carbon free product, the whole value chain of electric vehicles to which it was contributing would also need to be decarbonised.
This raises another challenge for companies that are mature in their decarbonisation approach, which is how to account for avoided emissions, aka Scope 4 emissions.
In 2013, the GHG Protocol identified avoided emissions as emission reductions which occur outside a product’s lifecycle or value chain, but as a result of the use of the product. 
Engie defines its accounting methodology as a way to measure a company’s contribution, via its products, to the decarbonisation of its customers.
There is currently no standard, or robust accounting for how organisations define the quantity of avoided emissions associated with the use of their products and services; the emergence of different frameworks in different jurisdictions creates the potential for companies to use the most favourable to their operations.
Engie Impact has developed six principles that guide this accounting and how to communicate the results.
The principles in brief are: identify the scope of assessment; establish a credible baseline; ensure calculation consistency; use pragmatic accounting; manage double counting; and implement transparent, verifiable and separate communication.
“It adds a level of rigour to companies’ desire to claim avoided emissions, and also puts in place a standard to overcome any greenwashing that might occur in stating them,” says Martin.
The intention is to give companies confidence in their numbers around avoided emissions. “Standardisation of the approach is key because it puts everyone on a level playing field in how to implement this accounting,” says Martin.
Engie hopes its methodology will be quite widely adopted, so that as organisations in similar spheres put the principles in place, they can compare similar products to see which has more or less of an environmental impact, and the figures will spur an element of competition to legitimately improve decarbonisation performance.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/07/lion-energy-sniffs-green-hydrogen-potential-and-pads-over-to-queensland/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",NATALIE FILATOFF,"JUNE 7, 2021",Lion Energy sniffs green hydrogen potential and pads over to Queensland,"“Lion remains committed to its exciting conventional oil and gas business in Indonesia,” wrote Executive Chairman Tom Soulsby in the company’s Annual Report 2020. At the same time he said, Lion Energy “is busy positioning itself  at the critical juncture of resources, markets and technology in green hydrogen in Australia”.
Last week Perth-based Lion, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Wagner Corporation, a family-owned property and infrastructure developer and asset manager, which built, owns and runs Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport and its adjacent Wellcamp Business Park. In July 2018, Wagner Corp also completed development of the 40-tonne industrial Pinkenba Wharf, on the Brisbane River, to service cement clinker ships which provide materials to its original core business in concrete and construction materials.
The MOU agrees to “explore opportunities in the development of green hydrogen facilities and related infrastructure”, at both Pinkenba Wharf and Wellcamp Business Park locations, said an ASX announcement by Lion Energy on Thursday last week.
Lion is at pains to point out that this is a no-strings MOU, and implies no obligation to proceed to development: “The Company cautions that there can be no certainty that a suitable hydrogen opportunity will be identified.”
To give the green hydrogen potential a thorough investigation, however, Lion Energy on Wednesday announced it had signed a service agreement with Queensland University of Technology (QUT), a forerunner in enabling Australia’s hydrogen ambitions, for deployment of its myGlobe geospatial data-visualisation software to help identify optimal locations for green hydrogen infrastructure in Queensland.
The University’s researchers are expected to combine data on solar and wind resources, surface and groundwater resources, electricity transmission, natural gas pipelines, major roads and rail connections, energy trade connections and land earmarked for or hosting industrial activities, transport hubs and ports… in their assessment of site suitability.
Soulsby was quoted in both ASX announcements as saying, “We re-emphasise the criticality of focusing our efforts at the intersection of renewable electricity and water resources, hydrogen markets and technology.”
For its part, Wagner prides itself on being, “innovative, integrated and international”. It has operations in eight countries, and is a key player in the Queensland industrial landscape, frequently demonstrating cutting-edge, low-emissions materials developed by its New Generation Building Materials division in its own industrial real-estate constructions.
It has devoted years to developing and achieving building certifications for its Earth Friendly Concrete (EFC), a geopolymer material that offers higher structural performance than conventional concrete as well as an 80% reduction in the CO2 emissions of the traditional cement-based concrete. 
In 2014 it used EFC in construction of its Brisbane West Wellcamp Airport — in 51,000 m² of heavy duty pavements for turning nodes and taxiways, as well as in the foundations, wall panels and entry bridge of the terminal building. In that project it says it achieved a saving of some 8,800 tonnes of CO2 by using EFC instead of conventional materials.

Wagner Corp’s construction of Pinkenba Wharf also included precast EFC sections, structurally strengthened with the company’s fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) bars. The use of these materials had advantages over conventional steel and concrete construction for a marine environment and also resulted in “vastly reduced embodied carbon”, the company reported.
Wagners, as the corporation’s construction arm (invested in cement, fly ash, quarries, mobile crushing and concrete plants, and more) is known, was also the contractor for concrete wind turbine foundations at Coopers Gap Wind Farm (123 turbines) in Kingaroy, Queensland; and Sapphire Wind Farm (75 turbines) at Glen Innes in New South Wales.
Unavailable for comment today, Wagner Corporation is its own industrial ecosystem, potentially ripe for using green hydrogen in its production processes, and to drive its transport fleet. The company’s most recent Annual Report says that in FY2020 its transport team hauled 5.5 million tonnes of product and travelled more than 6.8 million kilometres.
Lion Energy, in the meantime, sees “a material ongoing role for oil and gas in the global energy mix over the coming decades”, but says in its 2020 Annual Report that the board “has made a strategic decision to explore energy sector diversification and opportunities in the potentially disrupting green hydrogen gas/liquids business”. In mid-2021, it has begun executing on that plan.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/07/new-unsw-review-of-research-invites-a-rethink-of-silicon-heterojunction-solar-cell-manufacture/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"JUNE 7, 2021",A new UNSW review of research invites a rethink of silicon heterojunction solar cell manufacture,"Heterojunction solar cells have the potential to provide the next big efficiency leap in solar output, but their need for low processing temperatures means they require very high quality, expensive n-type silicon wafers as input to production. In recent years, significant research has been devoted to eliminating defects in low-cost p-type silicon, so that it could start to match and perhaps surpass the cost-to-efficiency ratios of the long-time hero of the photovoltaic industry — PERC technology.
A new review of research into defect engineering in p-type wafers could reroute the path to a silicon heterojunction (SHJ) takeover.
Although Australia has seen record uptake of rooftop solar, the upfront cost of a solar system remains a barrier to more widespread slathering of solar on buildings both here and overseas. Engineering more efficient solar cells would mean households need fewer solar panels, with attendant lower installation costs, to meet their electricity needs, and homes with small roof expanses could get more bang per solar panel.
Recent research into raising the performance of cheap p-type silicon wafers, using processes such as gettering of wafers before they enter production and annealing at the end of the cell-production process, has shown great promise, but says Dr Matthew Wright, lead author of the review paper, it also reveals solid research evidence that “the same techniques can be applied to n-type wafers to improve the performance of those cells”.
Wright is an Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) post-doctoral fellow in the School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Engineering (SPREE) at the University of New South Wales, working on the final stages of the four-year Hydrogenated and Hybrid-Heterojunction P-type Silicon Solar Cells project, led by UNSW’s Associate Professor Brett Hallam.
He and the new review paper’s second author, PhD student Bruno Vicari Stefani, talked to pv magazine Australia about the twist to their review which is based on Vicari Stefani’s PhD on improving p-type silicon, plus the work of other scientists at UNSW including Dr Anastasia Soeriyadi; the Australian National University (ANU); Arizona State University; and also the results gleaned from manufacturers who are already incorporating some of these methods into production.
Globally, a number of manufacturers are producing SHJ solar cells, including Hevel Solar. The Russian manufacturer produces 340 MW of  SHJ cells annually, and claims an efficiency of 24.1%.
Wright says that Chinese Tongwei Solar, “probably the biggest manufacturer of solar cells in the world has an unbelievable expected PERC capacity of 55 GW by the end of this year, but they also have one gigawatt of expected capacity for silicon heterojunction as well”, which shows, he says, that “they’re investing in this technology as a potential next phase”.
The thinking has been that if manufacturers could substitute cheap p-type silicon for the current standard use of n-type in SHJ production, while not sacrificing too much of the p-type efficiency, the tide of production and further development might swing towards SHJ, to give greater cost-to-efficiency benefits than PERC can now achieve.
PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell) technology was invented by Scientia Professor Martin Green of UNSW in the early 1980s. Speaking at this year’s Smart Energy Summit, Green said that in 2021, around 95% of global silicon solar cell production will use p-monocrystalline PERC, and that the cost of energy produced by PERC-based solar modules will descend to 10 cents per watt by 2023.
PERC already uses the cheaper p-type silicon because, says Wright, the very high temperatures (around 700 degrees Celsius) used to form the electric field in the solar cell, and to solidify the metal contact points which are screen printed onto the cell as a metal paste, also have a positive — or passivating — effect on the quality of the silicon.
In SHJ cells, however, the material applied to the surface of the cells, which delivers their high-voltage efficiencies, is sensitive to heat, and cannot be subjected to greater than 200 degrees Celsius, “so all those kind of defect-engineering approaches that are inherent in the PERC cell fabrication, and which improve the quality of the silicon are out the window”, says Wright.
“The whole point of our review,” he adds, “and the whole point of Bruno’s thesis, is to get around that problem by treating the wafer before it goes into making the cell, and doing some kind of annealing process after the cell is finished.” 
In one example, researchers at UNSW are using high-intensity laser light, a process called illuminated annealing, to change structures within the cells as a final stage of production.

The cost of such processes is outlined in the review paper — Progress with Defect Engineering in Silicon Heterojunction Solar Cells — which has been released in the 60th-anniversary edition of the journal PSS Rapid Research Letters.
Wright explains that if processes start to incorporate cheaper p-type wafers, their efficiency will be lower. How much lower can that efficiency be and still deliver a cost benefit.
“If we go from n-type to p-type, and we save 10% in the cost of the wafers, but the cell efficiency is only 20% compared to 23%, then we wouldn’t be winning in the long run,” he says.
UNSW costing analysis found the efficiency of p-type silicon would need to be within about 0.5%abs to 0.4%abs compared with n-type.
So if n-type efficiency is 23%, the target for p-type efficiency would be 22.6%. If n-type is 24%, p-type would need to hit 23.6% for costs to break even. If p-type efficiencies could be pushed a little more, says Wright, “we’d be making cost savings”.
However, the real take-home message from the review paper, says Wright, is that “We’ve spent three to four years trying to develop techniques to increase the efficiency of cheaper low-quality wafers, but now we’re realising these techniques have a positive impact on n-type wafers as well.”
Which, he concludes, begs the question, “Do we need to rethink the standard industrial approach to silicon heterojunction solar cells?”
Improving the efficiency of more expensive n-type cells using some of these processes, may be the low-hanging fruit in terms of possible cost reductions for SHJ technologies.

The battery industry today comprises a range of commercialised energy storage technologies, from pumped hydroelectric to lead-acid batteries — but none match the quality and performance of lithium-ion battery storage, which excels in terms of cost efficiency, energy density, end-use flexibility and production volume.

According to the Energy Information Agency (EIA), lithium-ion battery storage has captured upwards of 90% market share in the U.S., and I believe that it will likely be the de facto energy storage technology from here on out. Beyond the automotive sector, batteries power everything from consumer electronics to aerospace to grid-scale and more, making it all the more imperative to understand the trajectory of the battery sector and its role in the transition to full electrification.
When we look at the market as a whole, we can draw clear parallels between the evolution of the battery sector and that of the solar industry decades ago. For early technologists, investors and adopters, the solar industry has taught us vital lessons that are now applicable as interest grows in the battery sector.
Today, battery technologies are one piece of the puzzle to accelerate the energy transition, and specifically, the software layer is expected to play a massive role by offering insights into new, sophisticated models of physical and chemical interactions, whether in electric vehicles or on the grid.
We’ve seen this play out in solar, and now we’re bringing the same playbook to the battery industry.

By reflecting on the challenges that impacted the solar industry, battery materials manufacturers will be better equipped to scale these next-generation technologies from the lab to have a real-world impact.
In particular, there are two challenges that we saw with the rise of the solar industry that the battery sector now must address and overcome in order to create a sustainable ecosystem for the long-term transition to 100% clean energy.
Amid the excitement of new battery technologies entering the market, companies need to prioritise the technology’s overall design from the get-go to avoid bottlenecks down the line. Specifically, battery manufacturers need to factor in a battery’s life expectancy based on frequency of use and track degradation, remaining life cycles and other considerations all the way to end of life.
In the early aughts of solar, we saw companies fall victim to poor initial project designs that ultimately inhibited potential growth. Firms that overlooked the importance of project design came out blazing with systems that were oversized in terms of capacity and cost by 10% to 30%  – sometimes in an attempt to erase errors in actual operations – that in turn made deployment more expensive.
Tracking design from the start is essential to meeting end goals, and the right software can provide the best top-down transparency in real-time, enabling projects to be more configurable and scalable. As the battery sector continues to grow, hardware companies need to explore software solutions that can mitigate bumps in the road to keep up with the fast-moving electrification goals.
Another unprecedented hurdle faced in the solar industry is the intensive amount of maintenance required to keep installed assets in good condition. Before the global PV industry developed in full swing, companies assumed the innovative solar systems at the time could conveniently produce electrons for their 20-30 year life cycles unmaintained.
In reality, many of these systems require replacement inverters, regular cleaning and other operations and maintenance care that were often initially overlooked. Analyst firm Wood Mackenzie predicts that operations and maintenance costs for global PV systems could reach as high as $9.4 billion annually by 2025.

In the case of batteries, maintenance has become a clear but economically draining priority amid higher-than-expected degradation rates from charging or discharging too quickly, which harms battery cells, causes fires and destroys the end-use product.
While a battery life cycle ranges depending on its application, sectors that rely on larger battery systems such as EVs and grid-scale will need clear, data-driven visibility into the health, performance, and eventual degradation of the battery in order to keep all assets up and running.
There is no silver bullet for the energy storage sector, but battery technologies can certainly benefit from better visibility enabled by software. In the coming years, batteries — whether lithium-ion, lithium-metal, or a yet-unmet technology — will only evolve to become increasingly software-defined, requiring breakthrough chemistries and production techniques that can buoy higher-quality energy density and competitive costs.
With software, what would traditionally take months or years of battery material development and testing condenses into mere weeks or days. Moreover, modern-day software will enable chemical architectures to be built in the cloud before being incorporated into physical lab bench testing. All these progressions will enable manufacturers to have more time to iterate and simulate thousands or millions of battery material combinations, resulting in significantly fewer costs and shorter development timelines down the line.
A major driving force of battery technology adoption lies in cost; as we saw decades prior in the solar industry, huge strides are being made in the battery sector to reduce hard costs. A recent influx of cost-competitive materials and advanced manufacturing techniques has reduced waste, improved quality and decreased hardware costs.

But how can we further drive down costs in order to drive cost-parity for EV or grid-scale batteries?
With the rising commoditisation of lithium-ion battery cells, costs won’t hinge on battery cell or equipment prices but on the “soft costs” that have been a looming detriment to the global PV market, accounting for up to 70% of installed solar cost. Similarly, lithium-ion battery system soft costs could account for over 50% of total expenses in the industry.
In order to unlock substantial market share, maximise operational efficiency and decrease these soft costs, we must look to breakthrough technologies that can streamline critical and innovative processes while remaining economical.
Today, the global battery market size across EVs, grid storage and other use cases is approximately $77 billion, slated to grow to $390 billion by 2025. As we saw with the solar industry, a battery industry at this scale can and will support standalone, venture-backable software businesses to elevate the battery ecosystem even further.
At Energize Ventures, we’ve been evaluating the battery and energy storage market for more than four years, waiting for the right time, technology and team to invest. Now, we’re seeing strong comparisons between the market sizes of the solar industry five years ago and the battery industry today.
In reality, the battery market is continuing to experience rapid growth as companies are spending 5 to10 percent of installed costs on software. This means we can anticipate today’s multi-billion dollar market to grow to about a $40-$50 billion market by 2030 for software innovation exclusively.
We are sitting at a junction in the industry’s evolution as the level of market maturity and rate of growth signal a turning point for greater and more meaningful digital innovation to help drive these formative renewable energy systems of the future. Right now is the peak of the battery era, and we are fast-approaching full electrification.

A student from New College of Florida, Antonia “Toni” Ginsberg-Klemmt, won a $10,000 OZY Genius Award for what she calls Gismo Power, a mobile solar carport with an integrated electric vehicle charger.
Ginsberg-Klemmt’s Gismo Power is a foldable solar carport that’s entirely mobile and can be folded for storage in a garage, in the event of a hurricane or any other extreme weather occurrence. In operation, the appliance can fit up to 24 solar modules on its frames, which can be angled or lowered depending on the position of the sun at any given time.
Antonia Ginsberg-Klemmt’s Gismo Power in action
The appliance also utilizes a SolarEdge Inverter/EV charger. This is connected to a 50ft extension cord, which serves as the plug for the Gismo Power to connect to the grid.
The OZY Genius Award is a $10,000 prize awarded to 10 college students pursuing “projects or ideas that have a positive impact on society.”
According to Ginsberg-Klemmt, the idea to create a portable solar EV charging carport came from the recognition that her school’s campus had no EV charging stations on the residential side, and as a way to avoid getting in an uncomfortably hot car after a long day of classes.
Because Gismo Power doesn’t have an attached battery system, the appliance must be connected to the grid, so it does not waste the electricity being generated when not charging a vehicle. While on the grid, however, the system acts just like any rooftop solar installation, sending excess generation back to the grid and paying for itself via net metering.
Ginsberg-Klemmt said that the decision not to include a battery at this point in time was decided by a desire to not increase the final price of a Gismo Power unit. She said she sees the unit as a generation solution for renters or members of homeowners associations that are solar averse, as well as people who may want to invest in rooftop solar, but do not have a suitable roof or have one that would need extensive repairs/modifications to host a system.
As of now, Ginsberg-Klemmt owns the only Gismo Power prototype, although she is working to construct a more powerful version for New College of Florida. Once that project is complete, Ginsberg-Klemmt plans on beta testing a handful of systems before pursuing any manufacturing or commercial scale. She estimates that the system would cost around $20,000, but that may not be reflective of the final price after beta testing.
Ginsberg-Klemmt is also pursuing OSHA & UL certification and generic permitting for the first grid-tied electrical appliance to generate electricity. This process includes improvements to electric code compliance and usability improvements. Once those benchmarks have been achieved and commercial scaling becomes a reality, Ginsberg-Klemmt plans to produce a “startup series” of 10-100 units, while also starting the “Gismo Power Factory,” a manufacturing facility.
And if Ginsberg-Klemmt’s name rings a bell, you may remember her father who took Florida Power and Light to the state Supreme Court over the denial of a petition to improve the net-metering regulations in the Sunshine State.
Taking a page from her father’s book, Ginsberg-Klemmt said that Gismo Power gives potential customers the opportunity to avoid the permitting and approval process that can bog down residential solar installation times.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/07/perovskite-stability-and-the-effects-of-defects/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN,SWEDEN,SWITZERLAND,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JUNE 7, 2021","Perovskite stability, and the effects of defects","From pv magazine Global 
Perovskite solar cells are well known for their high-efficiency potential and low-cost production. Solving the issues of long-term stability and sensitivity to moisture and other ambient atmosphere conditions, without hampering efficiency, will be a major step towards improving solar cell and module performance, and scientists have presented a wealth of different approaches to achieving this.
Many of these rely on additives to the perovskite precursor materials that serve to strengthen the crystalline structure, but in some cases can also harm its efficiency in generating energy. Now, a group of scientists led by the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2), and Switzerland’s École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne discovered an organic compound known as 3-phosphono propionic acid (H3pp), which served to greatly improve device stability with no observable effects on its solar performance.
The group fabricated complete perovskite solar cells based on a mixture of methylammonium, formadinum, and cesium, as well as lead and iodine. These cells achieved initial efficiencies of around 21%. When tested for 1,000 hours under “one-sun” illumination, the cells fabricated with H3pp retained close to 100% of their initial performance, while control cells without the additive suffered more than 20% performance loss.
Further analysis of the cells showed that the additive served to passivate ‘shallow’ defects in the material – creating strong hydrogen bonds that essentially block ion migration that can cause degradation in the material. Deeper defects that assist in cell performance, meanwhile, were left untouched. “The H3pp additive strongly bonds to the perovskite… via two types of hydrogen bonds (H.IandO.H), passivating shallow point defects,” the researchers explain. “Given that the passivation does not occur through deep defects, the non-radiative recombination is not mitigated, and the device performance (Voc and efficiency) remains unaffected by the presence of the H3pp additive.”
The devices and methods used to characterise them are described in the paper Decoupling the effects of defects on efficiency and stability through phosphonates in stable halide perovskite solar cells, published in Joule.
Beyond demonstrating this impressive device performance, the group hopes its research will help to improve understanding of different defect types that exist in a perovskite material, the characteristics they are responsible for, and ways to influence one without affecting another. Halide perovskites are “soft” ionic electronic conductors with a strong ionic component, which now, thanks to the results of this work, can be associated to shallow point defects. “This research provides new relevant information about the impact of defects in halide perovskite solar cells that will certainly help disentangle the effects of distinct defects on the different properties of the devices,” the group concludes.
