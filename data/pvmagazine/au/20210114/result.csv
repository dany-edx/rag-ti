https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/14/agl-continues-march-towards-850-mw-of-large-scale-battery-storage/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 14, 2021",AGL continues march towards 850 MW of large-scale battery storage,"Having announced in 2020 its commitment to build 850 MW of battery-based assets by 2024, Australia’s largest power producer confirmed on Thursday that Fluence and Finnish company Wärtsilä had been secured under non-exclusive framework agreements to supply up to 1 GW of large-scale battery storage.
AGL chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said Fluence and Wärtsilä were chosen through a competitive tender process for their capability, experience and pricing as well as their alignment with AGL’s strategic objectives.
“This framework agreement is another example of AGL getting on with the business of energy transition and will enable delivery against our commitment to build 850 MW of grid-scale battery storage by FY2024,” Brokhof said.
“Wärtsilä and Fluence are both global leaders in energy storage technologies, ensuring we are investing in the highest standards for performance, reliability and safety.
“We are already well advanced with our planning process and these framework agreements will reduce tender timeframes for individual projects, enabling faster project schedules and commercial operation.
“We’re excited to see our grid-scale battery plans begin to come to life.”
Brokhof said AGL has been Australia’s largest private investor in renewables and is now leading in the development of storage technology such as batteries, ranging in size from grid-scale to residential.
The energy giant has already laid out plans for the deployment of around 1.2 GW of utility-scale batteries across multiple locations, including a 250 MW, four-hour-duration battery system to be built at the site of its Torrens Island power station in South Australia.
AGL has also announced plans to build utility-scale batteries at Loy Yang A power station in Victoria (200MW) and Liddell power station (150MW) and Broken Hill (50MW) in New South Wales. Previously announced battery projects include Wandoan (100 MW) in Queensland, Maoneng (4 x 50 MW) in NSW, and Dalrymple (30 MW) in South Australia.
“We know energy storage technology is critical in creating cleaner and smarter distributed energy infrastructure,” Brokhof said.
“Our grid-scale battery plans provide critical firming capacity to the market and will play a leading role in the energy industry’s transition over the coming decades.”
Fluence vice president of global markets, Jan Teichmann, said AGL was taking battery-based energy storage in Australia to the next level and the proposed projects would deliver large-scale flexibility critical to the National Electricity Market (NEM).
“Australia’s grid is evolving quickly and batteries can fill critical gaps left by coal and gas retirements, both the super-fast services needed to strengthen the grid and as a source of peak power,” he said.
“The next few years will be pivotal for Australia’s transition towards a more decarbonized grid, and AGL is starting at the scale of the challenge: supporting the NEM’s shift to a higher percentage of renewables with large-scale flexibility.”
Thursday’s agreement with AGL is not Fluence’s first foray into the grid-scale battery storage market in Australia.
In 2018 the United States-based company successfully secured interconnection for the 30 MW/30 MWh solution deployed at AusNet Services’ Ballarat Terminal Station in Victoria.
The AGL agreement follows a period of significant growth for Fluence, a Siemens and AES company. In December, the United States-based outfit secured a commitment from the Qatar Investment Authority to invest US$125 million in the company, and in October, Fluence announced its acquisition of software developer Advanced Microgrid Solutions.

The range comprises the WSP-333MG and the 375 watt WST-375MG.
Winaico Australia managing director Blair Pester told pv magazine on Thursday the WST-375MG module would land in Australia before the end of January with the WSP-333MG to be available from April.
“Winaico is extremely excited to announce the arrival of these modules into the Asia Pacific region,” he said.
“The WST-375MG should be in our east coast warehouses just before Australia Day so we are going to be releasing shipments around then.
“The WSP-333MG is going to come a little later, around April, (so it’s) not too far away at all.”
Pester said the WST-375MG is Winaico’s most powerful module built to date. It features six strings of 20 monocrystalline silicon cells, nine bus bars and measures 1.759m x 1.034m x 35mm and weighs in at 20.6 kg. The accompanying data sheet claims it outperforms almost all other commercial options on the market with 20.62% efficiency.
The WST-375MG module “offers our customers great bang for buck and is well suited to the commercial market as well as residential customers wanting to maximise their roof space” the company said in a statement.
By contrast, the WSP-333MG delivers 20.27% efficiency and comes in at only 1.589m long and weighs just over 19.7kg. No other specifics were made available but the module does feature the strengthened frame synonymous with the WSP range and includes Winaico’s patented drainage corners, making it suitable for high-dust environments or low-pitch installations.
Pester said the WSP-333MG had been optimised for small roofs and the decision to produce a 333 W module was a deliberate response to market demand.
“The market has shifted,” he said. “A lot of installers install 6.6kW on a 5kW inverter. They wanted something bigger so we jumped on board that, retooled and started building these.
“The benefit of a 333 W panel means you can lay out 1 kW blocks easily and oversize inverters by one third simply.
“The new Gemini series is going to be an absolute gamechanger for our partners by boosting the power of both WSP and WST ranges.”
Pester said the Gemini modules have been designed with the installer in mind. Both modules will come with 1.2m cables to give installers greater flexibility and freedom when doing system designs.
Both modules come with a 25-year product and performance warranty and two-year system insurance.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/14/australian-researchers-to-set-solar-pv-pace-following-4-5-million-funding-boost/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 14, 2021",Australian researchers to set solar PV pace following $4.5 million funding boost,"The Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) has provided the ANU with $3.6 million in funding as part of the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics Infrastructure project while the university has chipped in $900,000.
The university this week announced the money will finance “state-of-the-art” equipment for three projects with $3.1 million allocated for a new nano-engineering laboratory while $400,000 has been dedicated to a project exploring perovskite solar technology.
The funding for the perovskite project comes just weeks after UK-based Oxford PV announced a cell featuring the synthetic material was used to set a world record for the amount of the sun’s energy that can be converted into electricity by a single solar cell.
Oxford PV said the cell converted 29.52% of solar energy into electricity. In contrast, standard silicon cells have an average conversion rate of just 15-20% and a practical maximum conversion rate of around 26%. Existing research indicates perovskite has impressive capabilities as a conductor with Oxford PV claiming 35kg of perovskite generates the same amount of power as seven tons of silicon.
Associate Professor Tom White is leading ANU’s perovskite project and he said the latest funding would help provide an advanced processing tool which will allow them to coat traditional silicon solar cells with a film of perovskite, similar to the technology used by Oxford PV, to better utilise photons across the solar spectrum.
“The new tool will allow us to deposit very thin perovskite solar cells directly on top of silicon solar cells,” White said.
“By combining two different technologies in this way we can increase the energy output of the solar cell.”
The latest round of funding will also finance a new ‘nano-engineering’ laboratory which will help researchers create new materials to enhance the conversion of solar energy to electricity in PV devices.
Dr Kean Chern Fong, a senior research fellow at the ANU’s College of Engineering and Computer Science, said the new $3.1 million lab will help Australian researchers “set the pace” when it comes to simultaneously reducing cost and improving efficiency in solar cells, as well as the development of novel photovoltaic concepts.
“This laboratory will be one-of-a-kind internationally,” he said.
“It will empower world-class scientists and aspiring PhD candidates in Australia towards development of revolutionary technologies for many years to come.”
A third project, being led by Dr Hieu Nguyen, was awarded $1 million for equipment which will allow researchers to more precisely measure light absorbed and emitted from solar materials.
“This technology will mean we can move a step closer to unlock the full potential of photovoltaics as a clean, affordable, and sustainable energy source for Australia and the world,” Nguyen said.
“Because every part of light has features corresponding to certain material and device properties, we can diagnose their characteristics by just ‘looking at’ them, rather than touching them – thus avoiding possible damage.”
The university said the three projects will “contribute to unlocking the full potential of photovoltaics as a clean, affordable, and sustainable energy source for Australia and the world”.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/14/why-you-should-join-the-charge-for-solar-batteries/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JANUARY 14, 2021",Why you should join the charge for solar batteries,"Having installed hundreds of solar batteries across Australia I wanted to share my thoughts and predictions on the past, present and future of solar batteries.
The market is constantly growing, evolving, and picking up the pace. It’s really interesting to look back and see how far solar batteries have come in such a short space of time. I mean, in the last year alone we can see the jump from the Powerwall to the Powerwall 2. This jump is representative of the whole solar battery industry, demonstrating how rapidly technology is advancing, and with each advance solar batteries become more and more popular.
At the outset of 2021 we may still be in the foothills of massive solar battery uptake, but as installers we are certainly starting to feel the incline. As a solar electrician let me take you through my thoughts on the industry of solar batteries.
Current consumer demand for solar batteries in Australia
The demand for solar batteries in Australia isn’t as big as you might think. Due to their high cost, not all homeowners can afford to store their excess power using a battery. This means that most Australians are missing out on a solar battery because it may not be seen as a valuable investment. Moreover, unlike solar panels, there remains limited choices for solar batteries, and these choices all float around the same price range.
We’ve certainly found that most of the demand is for clients who have a large budget and are willing to spend the extra money without necessarily needing a quick return on investment. Homeowners who already have a solar system providing a high return on investment seem to be good candidates for solar batteries as well. There is also a high demand from regional folks with limited or intermittent access to the power grid, often due to infrastructural fragility and resultant blackouts.
On this note, the majority of solar consumers will be installing solar to reduce the cost of their energy bills and definitely taking advantage of the solar rebates that are available. This means that money is a driving force in their choice in renewable energy products. Therefore, solar batteries are still far too expensive (at the moment) to be as big as solar.
Along with the price, most homeowners actually have a small solar panel system. Their system may not actually be able to produce enough energy to fully charge a solar battery. This would mean that getting a battery could end up being an expensive mistake, taking a very long time to pay off.
A Smart Energy Council (SEC) report stated that an estimated 52,500 solar battery storage systems (off and on grid) were installed in Australia by the end of 2017. When you compare this to the potential 2 million residential homes with solar panels it seems like nothing.
Right now, most demand for solar batteries is from those who can either afford it, or desperately need it.

The charge of change
Let’s roll the tape back a bit. From my experience solar batteries only really started to pick up in Australia from 2016 with the release of the Tesla Powerwall 2 at a good price point. After this solar batteries began to become more and more popular with homeowners.
There have been a few changes to the battery industry. The government has introduced more financial incentives for those who are looking at investing in a solar battery, and Tesla Powerwalls have had a few price changes over the past few years.
You can now receive a large rebate to help with the upfront costs of solar batteries in SA and VIC. Since 2015 it would seem that the number of solar batteries installations have tripled. It’s estimated that 70,000 battery installs may happen this year, and that Australia will take up to 30% of global demand for solar batteries.
Drivers of consumer demand for batteries
Right now the biggest driver for consumer demand for solar batteries is investing in a premium product that offers long term savings. Being able to store the energy that is produced by your solar system is extremely valuable to homeowners. This will further reduce their bills as they will be pulling less energy from the grid at high prices.
Solar batteries offer an extremely safe return on investment. They are a premium product with advanced technology to allow homeowners complete freedom of their own energy. This is exactly why people invest in solar batteries. The drive is a high-end product being able to offer them more than what standard energy prices can offer.
For some people this investment could provide a cheaper, greener future. It may even change the lives of those who are suffering from increasing electricity prices or frequent power cuts. Solar batteries offer security for your home. Just knowing that your home is safe from blackouts, and you have full control over where you are spending your electricity, is a driving force for some to make this investment.
Additionally, when batteries do start to become more affordable, the demand will certainly increase. I have absolutely no doubt about this. However, people who are choosing to wait must realise that they are missing out on huge savings. It could potentially be costing you more to wait for a decreased price than actually investing in a solar battery. Like any investment, the sooner you act the more you will save.
Another interesting driving force however, is the technology within the solar battery. For those people who have done their research into solar batteries it seems that they are more likely to invest in a higher-end battery with long warranties and advanced technology. Most people prefer to spend the extra money on a good solar battery rather than on a cheaper one that may not last as long, store as much energy, or even lose energy through its storage cycles.
Most homeowners are looking for a battery with a large storage capacity, high round trip efficiency and a long life span. This seems to be the biggest buying point for those who are interested in solar batteries. Right now, it’s pretty limited to three batteries in Australia which are Tesla’s Powerwall 2, Sonnen’s solar battery and the LG Chem. Hive battery is also a good budget option.
Potential drawbacks for installers
The biggest challenge when it comes to solar battery installation is satisfying Clean Energy Council (CEC) installation guidelines. Finding the best location to install the battery as well as ensuring all guidelines are met can prove quite a struggle.
Batteries cannot be installed if there are windows in the above clearances or if the room is habitable (e.g bedroom, living room). Batteries cannot be installed in direct sunlight either, meaning that outdoor areas can sometimes be difficult to negotiate.
Lastly, if we install a battery onto plasterboard there is a requirement to install a fireproof sheet on the wall behind the battery as well. This may or may not bother some homeowners. Overall, this is the biggest challenge for solar installers.
Apart from this, solar batteries don’t have many drawbacks for installers. The future is bright and demand is picking up.
The future of solar batteries and virtual power plants
Solar batteries have an incredibly bright future ahead of them. Both commercial, residential and solar farm batteries provide a chance for you to store cleanly generated energy. At the moment, most of this power is going to waste.
This means that investing in solar batteries is a safe, valuable investment. And yet, battery technology is still relatively nascent, meaning advances and improvements are not only coming thick and fast, but that there is also the very real potential for the kind of world breaking advances that offer something never seen before.
If we take a look at Tesla’s jump from the Powerwall to the Powerwall 2 in 2015, you can see how quickly the technology advanced while keeping roughly at the same price point. With technology advancing so quickly, there is no doubt the future of solar batteries is extremely secure.
Furthermore, governments are beginning to push solar batteries more and more. States like Victoria and South Australia are offering large subsidies to reduce the upfront investment for first time solar battery buyers. With time, I think there will be a federal incentive for homeowners to invest in a solar battery too.
And keep in mind, I’m saying all this without having yet mentioned Virtual Power Plants (VPPs), a combined source of independent power using a solar system and battery. When enough people in an area can produce their own power, VPPs offer a chance to trade your energy with others who need it. In return, when you need it most you can pull energy from others in your VPP. This results in much lower energy costs, a more environmentally friendly community and less load on the grid.
So far VPPs have proven popular among those who have solar power and battery systems. In South Australia there are several different VPP’s including Tesla and Sonnen VPPs.
Due to the massive benefits of VPPs we believe that this will be a big feature of our future. Not only do VPPs help homeowners individually, but also the whole community with lower energy prices, and the whole world with less greenhouse gases and co2 emissions. Many people are already signed up and pushing others to join a VPP – the more the merrier.
I predict within the next decade or so there will be several VPPs set up around Australia as popularity is growing. These VPP companies might offer something like a free battery/system under a contract if you sign up with them. You can then pay off your system slowly through the money that you are saving on your bills each month. It’s too early to say if this is going to happen yet but I think when it does, it will kickstart the VPP industry. Right now is a good chance to get signed up with one to start seeing immediate savings and a higher return on investment.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/14/woodmac-predicts-apac-renewables-growth-but-coal-resilience-in-2021/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,ASIA,AUSTRALIA,CHINA",BLAKE MATICH,"JANUARY 14, 2021",Woodmac predicts APAC renewables growth but coal resilience in 2021,"When China celebrates it’s New Year on February 12th it will be entering the year of the Ox. However, for the rest of the Asia Pacific 2021 is shaping up to be the year of China. That is, at least, the prediction of some of Wood Mackenzie’s (WoodMac) APAC analysts for the year ahead.
Renewables
When it comes to renewables in 2021, WoodMac’s APAC Power & Renewables research director, Alex Whitworth, believes that the growth of wind and solar in the region will continue to accelerate but coal will remain resilient.
“I’m very optimistic on the growth of renewables installations in China,” said Whitworth. “Numbers being thrown around of more than 100 GW of additions in 2021 for wind and solar, which is double what we had expected at the beginning of 2020, primarily due to China’s 2060 carbon neutral target.”
“I’m also expecting to see an uptick in Chinese manufacturing and exports – ” Whitworth continued ” – as much of the rest of the world still struggles with the pandemic – which will drive rising electricity demand. While many countries are talking about shorter and more secure supply chains, China’s technology, manufacturing and low-cost advantages are steadily improving. ”
Coal
However, despite this continuation of long term positive trends, Whitworth says that coal is “proving highly resilient and while some countries are moving to accelerate retirements of coal plants, overall coal fire generation in Asia is on an upward trajectory in the next few years.”
In fact, despite China’s rapid renewable growth, over 40 GW of new coal plants were permitted by the government in 2020.
Relatedly, WoodMac’s Head of Thermal Coal Research, Dale Hazelton, predicts that the Chinese ban on Australian coal imports will last the entirety of 2021.
“While having access to Australian coal certainly makes things easier for Chinese buyers,” said Hazelton, “there are plenty of alternative sources available if they are willing to pay more. International supply chains can be realigned to continue to meet China’s demand. Domestic coal prices were allowed to soar last year, demonstrating the Chinese government’s willingness to fund this shift in the sourcing of its imports.”
However, it’s not just an easy matter of trading out Australia for Brazil or other trading partners. The effects of political tension are already being felt. According to a CNBC report, several major Chinese cities have “gone dark” as a result of the coal shortage which Chinese authorities are attributing to exceptionally high demand and routine maintenance.
Gas
Another side-effect of the Sino-Australian political tensions resulting in the coal ban is rebounding demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), which has, according to Forbes, hit an all-time record price o $20.70 per million British thermal units. As one of the world’s biggest exporters of LNG Australia is raking in the cash, but, of course, this does nothing to domestic electricity prices and further rubbishes suggestions from the Morrison Government throughout 2020 that cheap gas prices would allow it to fuel the transition to renewables. Gas is no longer cheap. So much so that AGL and other energy giants are fighting it out in South-Eastern Australia for LNG import terminals to bring in foreign LNG to put pressure on domestic energy prices.

Netherlands-based Rads Global Business BV has developed a multifunctional anti-soiling nanocoating for solar glass that is also claimed to mitigate potential-induced degradation (PID), and to be anti-reflective and anti-corrosive.
“This coating can be used for dry cleaning by robots in large PV plants,” company CEO, Rajbeer Singh, told pv magazine. “It increases the efficiency of wet cleaning by reducing water consumption in the range of 50 to 70% due to the self-cleaning function of the coating,” he said, noting that soiling, scaling, corrosion, abrasion and glass reflection can reduce transmission of light through the module glass in real field conditions in a range of 5% to 20%.
According to him, the coating solution can increase the performance of a PV power project by between 5 and 15% and ensure a reduced cost of cleaning and fewer damages to PV modules due to corrosion and operation and maintenance. “Our coating can reduce the cost of cleaning by 60%,” he explained, adding that revenue increase for a PV project in deserts and the polluted site could be in the range of 8 to 18%.
The technology is patented in the Netherlands and the coating production is planned to be located in India, where a factory is currently under construction. “As the coating is applied to the tempered cut size solar glass, the coating line can be installed with any solar glass manufacturer as well as PV module manufacturer,” Singh said. “The coating is applied through a chemical combustion vapour deposition (CCVD) process and this process makes it highly durable.” According to him, the coating could be applied directly to the module in a panel factory or onto the solar glass in a glass factory.

The coating has already shown extremely good results in real field conditions, according to Singh. It was applied manually to a solar park in Delhi, India, and tested during 2016 and 2021. The test showed that it helped the modules produce approximately 8.9% more power than non-coated modules located at the site.
“This product can be applied to the existing PV fields, which means the existing projects can get extra revenue and reduced cost of operations and maintenance,” the CEO continues. “Since water for cleaning is a serious challenge for all the existing big PV projects in water scares regions, this coating can be a rescue for these projects”
 According to him, the cost of the coating through the coating line may represent between 2 and 3% of the total cost of a PV project.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/14/new-mounting-system-to-integrate-small-pv-into-wind-farms/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JANUARY 14, 2021",New mounting system to integrate small PV into wind farms,"From pv magazine Germany
Experts agree that solar PV and wind power are equally needed to support the energy transition. The two technologies are rarely located at the same site, but this could change in the future.
At least, that is the dream of Werner Palm, the managing director of Swiss mounting system manufacturer Smartvolt AG. The company is now working with German wind specialist Westfalen Wind, which has deployed an innovative 96.8 kW pilot PV project in the gravel crane parking area of a wind turbine. The two companies used a Smartvolt mounting system to deploy pre-assembled solar module strings, which can simply be folded out on site.
“Thanks to our patented crane beam, it can be erected in three minutes per kilowatt, and dismantled in around six minutes,” said Palm.
The PV system can be easily dismantled if the wind farm’s floor space is needed for maintenance work, he noted.
“As a rule, this is only necessary once every 20 years,” added Daniel Saage, the managing director of Westfalen Wind.
Then the solar modules can be folded up and installed again after the maintenance work has been completed. Thus far, Smartvolt has not subjected the system to a long-term load test.
“But five to 10 times shouldn’t be a problem,” Palm said.
Both companies see the advantages of this combination because the technical infrastructure to connect the PV system to the grid via the wind turbine is already in place. In addition, there are no additional space requirements and an area that has already been sealed can still be used. The annual yield of the PV system is around 85,000 kWh, which could cover around two-thirds of the wind power plant’s own requirements per year. This is around 96,000 kWh and is usually generated by the wind turbine itself.
The local network operator has agreed to approve the PV project as a classic self-consumption system. Whenever the wind turbine is not spinning, its own electricity requirements can be covered with photovoltaics, which ensures that the wind generator is significantly more profitable.
However, Saage said bureaucratic factors are still preventing a breakthrough. The pure manufacturing costs for a 100 kW system are around €600 ($730) per kilowatt installed. In addition, there are building permit fees and compensation payments, as well as other costs. But if such obstacles are eliminated, a few hundred kilowatts of solar could be installed at wind farms without additional costs.
“This would significantly reduce costs and make the overall concept more economically attractive,” he said.
Westfalen Wind has said that around one-fifth to one-eighth of crane parking space could be used for PV systems. However, the wind turbines towers must not face south – ideally, the PV systems should be built with an east-west orientation. In the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia alone, Saage sees the potential for 60 MW of solar at crane parking areas. Throughout all of Germany, capacity could reach 300 MW, he added.
