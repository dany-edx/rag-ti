While details about the project remain scant, RTE revealed the manufacturing facility will allow for the production of heterojunction solar cells, utilising technology provided by Switzerland-headquartered manufacturer Ecosolifer.
Heterojunction solar cells, a technology already in large-scale production and expected to grow its market share significantly over the coming decade, rely on a layer of amorphous silicon to provide passivation and improve cell performance.
EcoSolifer commenced commercial production of its bifacial heterojunction solar cells in 2020 with a manufacturing line provided by heterojunction specialist Meyer Burger at a 100 MW factory located in Hungary.
The company said the cells produced at the facility have now reached a conversion efficiency of 24.1% but added the result was still be confirmed by a third party.
RTE said the heterojunction cells would be manufactured at its Townsville facility with modules to be assembled on site.

Construction of the factory, which is to be partially powered by renewable energy with a solar farm to be built as part of the project, is forecast to commence in 2022. Construction of the solar farm, for which no details were provided, is set to begin in 2023. Manufacturing is expected to start in 2023, with full production by March 2024.
Townsville City Council said the project is expected to support an estimated 450 full-time equivalent direct and indirect jobs during its construction phase and about 825 jobs once operational.
Council said construction is expected to add about $59 million to the city’s gross regional product (GRP), while the total project budget is expected to add around $290 million.
The project would see RTE join Tindo Solar as Australia-based solar PV module manufacturers.
Tindo Solar, which has been manufacturing solar PV modules at its Mawson Lakes facility in Adelaide’s northern suburbs for more than a decade, is currently in the process of commissioning a new factory in Adelaide.

The new facility will boost the company’s production capacity to 150 MW per annum and see Tindo transition to the latest M10 cell technology.
RTE is one of four companies which this week signed on to be part of the Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct, which aims to co-locate clean energy generation with industrial and manufacturing facilities across more than 2,000 hectares of dedicated land 40 kilometres south of Townsville.
Australian mining and minerals outfit Solquartz plans to construct a multi-module silicon smelter which will supply silicon to the solar PV and battery manufacturing industries.
Solquartz said the facility would produce 52,000 tonnes per annum of silicon metal and 9,100 tonnes of silica fume (powder).
The first phase of the smelter construction is forecast to start in 2023, with phase two to commence in 2025.
Also signing on was Origin Energy Future Fuels which is proposing to develop a commercial-scale green hydrogen production facility in the precinct while North Queensland Gas Pipeline has also been tentatively allocated space in the precinct.
Queensland government
The news comes after council formally agreed to partner with the Queensland Government to deliver a $16 million suite of road and rail projects to enhance access to Lansdown and the Australian Government committed $12 million for enabling infrastructure.
“The confidence in Lansdown is clearly on display,” Mayor Jenny Hill said. “We are now entering into the most exciting phase, with long-term proponents preparing to move into construction and new proponents from across Australia putting their hand up to also establish themselves at the precinct.”
The addition of the four companies as proponents follows Edify Energy, Queensland Pacific Minerals and Imperium3 Townsville signing on previously.
Renewables developer Edify Energy has been granted development approval to build and operate a green hydrogen production plant of up to 1 GW, as well as a behind-the-meter solar and battery storage facility within the precinct.
Queensland Pacific Minerals plans to produce battery-grade nickel and cobalt sulphate from a nickel-cobalt ore. Imperium3 Townsville is seeking to develop an 18 GWh lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing facility, according to the council.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/09/bluescope-pushes-ahead-with-green-hydrogen-plans/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 9, 2021",BlueScope pushes ahead with green hydrogen plans,"Australian-headquartered BlueScope has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Shell Energy Operations to collaborate on two green hydrogen projects, including the development of a renewable hydrogen electrolyser plant that would accelerate the steel giant’s ambition to decarbonise the Port Kembla Steelworks.
The initial project will investigate the design, construction and operation of a pilot-scale 10 MW renewable hydrogen electrolyser to explore and test the use of green hydrogen in the blast furnace at the Port Kembla facility.
The aim is to demonstrate green hydrogen as a pathway towards low emissions steelmaking. The companies said the hydrogen could also potentially be used for other purposes, such as to feed a pilot direct reduced iron (DRI) plant.
The BlueScope-Shell MoU also provides the option for the companies to collaborate with other organisations to develop a “hydrogen hub” in the Illawarra, including renewable energy supply and hydrogen and electricity infrastructure.
That aspect of the project would also examine the logistics infrastructure required for a commercially viable hydrogen supply chain in the Illawarra.
“We are looking to the future; short, medium and long term and we are looking forward to seeing what a pilot hydrogen electrolyser can teach us about the production, storage and handling of hydrogen and, importantly, how hydrogen will behave in a blast furnace, BlueScope chief executive Mark Vassella said.
“The projects announced today demonstrate BlueScope’s commitment to taking real action on climate change.”
Shell Australia chairman Tony Nunan said the MoU would leveraging each of the company’s strengths and capabilities to explore the development of integrated hydrogen supply chains.
“Hydrogen has the potential to play a key role in decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors, many of which are central to Australia’s economic and social development,” he said.
“Collaborations such as these are fundamental to accelerating progress towards a net-zero emissions future.”

The BlueScope-Shell MoU is part of BlueScope’s previously announced climate investment program of up to $150 million over the next five years and the latest in a string of commitments the company has made in relation to manufacturing green steel at its Port Kembla facility.
BlueScope last month signed an MoU with Rio Tinto to focus on using green hydrogen for direct reduction of the mining giant’s Pilbara iron ores and In November 2020, Bluescope backed the NSW government’s renewable infrastructure plan through a $20 million investment into the development of a Renewable Manufacturing Zone at the Port Kembla site. The investment seeks to encourage innovation in the renewable sector and work towards the government’s goal of constructing the state’s Renewable Energy Zones with local materials.
“We will invest directly in our own plant,” Vassella said at the time, “but also partner with innovators and entrepreneurs to develop new technology solutions in key industries like renewables, infrastructure, defence, manufacturing and sustainable buildings.”
The announcement of the BlueScope-Shell MoU comes after the state’s green hydrogen strategy was approved last month, unlocking up to $3 billion in incentives to commercialise hydrogen supply chains and $70 million in government investment for the development of two new hydrogen hubs in the Illawarra and Hunter regions.

Gujarat-based Solex is putting up a 1.2 GW solar module manufacturing facility in Surat which will become operational by the end of January.
Solex representative Brijesh Khanna told pv magazine the new plant will be equipped to produce high-output, 500-750 Wp-rated, modules which will feature 182mm, M10 wafers, and 210mm G12 products, to offer conversion efficiencies of more than 21%.
The manufacturer then plans to install solar cell production facilities with an annual capacity of 1 GW in 2023 as well as another 2.5 GW of module lines in the same year, for a total module output of 3.7 GW.
“We will start working on [the] cell line as soon as our 1.2 GW module fab becomes operational in January,” said Khanna. 
Solex is also planning a ‘plug-and-play’ solar development area in Bharuch, where energy generators without land or roof space can set up PV projects. The site, which it is expected will take four to five months to develop, will be able to host 15 MW of generation capacity.
National Stock Exchange-listed Solex is one of India’s oldest PV module manufacturers and has had a 50 MW production plant at Anand, in Gujarat, since 2007. That fab produces 335 Wp polycrystalline and 390 Wp monocrystalline modules.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/09/5-minute-settlement-battery-smarts-make-hazelwood-battery-a-reality/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"DECEMBER 9, 2021","5-minute settlement, battery smarts make Hazelwood battery a reality","Not unlike other large-scale battery storage systems in Australia before it, the 150 MW/150 MWh system being supplied by Fluence at the former Hazelwood coal-fired power station site is shaping up to be a trend-setting project. Developed without government funding, by a multinational utility, and financed by one of Australia’s largest institutional investors, the Hazelwood battery is demonstrating how large sale storage projects can be realised and their future role on the National Electricity Market (NEM).
“The key message about this opportunity at Hazelwood, which was a coal-fired power plant and is now decommissioned, is that [owner] Engie wanted to repurpose it to create a long-term sustainable asset,” Aaron McCann, the GM APAC for Fluence tells pv magazine Australia.
McCann acknowledges that the NEM’s ancillary services markets – known officially as Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) – will be a significant revenue stream for the Hazelwood battery, but added that charging with cheap energy during low price periods and discharging at times of wholesale price peaks will deliver additional value.

“Batteries can help absorb the oversupply of renewable energy when it’s plentiful, and then to redistribute that energy into high value time periods,” said McCann.
The implementation of 5-minute settlements (5MS) in the NEM, from the previous 30-minute settlements, has improved the business case for big batteries, such as Hazelwood, argues McCann.
“The transition to 5MS intervals means assets need to rapidly respond to price signals,” he says. “Fluence’s AI-powered bidding software also allows battery operators to harnesses the full potential of the battery. But the 5MS rule change was certainly one of the factors [behind the project going ahead].”
Fluence is deploying what it describes as its “AI-powered bidding software”, known as the Fluence IQ Bidding Application, at the Hazelwood battery energy storage system (BESS). The company claims the software uses AI to provide more accurate price forecasts and then determines the optimal bidding strategy to maximise revenue for the BESS.
“The AI-bidding application was a huge factor,” says McCann. “It can materially increase the revenue captured by a battery. It does this by co-optimising revenue across all eight FCAS markets and the energy market. It’s all about timing.” He adds that the bidding software has already been deployed in nearly 4 GW of energy assets globally.
The NEM is seeing an increase in the frequency of very low or negative price events in the wholesale market – particularly in areas with very high renewable energy penetration like South Australia. Additionally, during the summer months, electricity demand peaks can deliver periods of exceptionally high spot-market prices – often exacerbated by failures at existing fossil-fuel generators.
Energy Synapse noted in a blog post this week that wholesale prices in South Australia were negative almost 40% of the time in September and October – providing an opportunity for batteries to charge and generate revenues at the same time.
“In Victoria, where Hazelwood is located, negatively priced intervals occurred 32% of the time in both September and October. This is particularly related to spring conditions – a lot of cool sunny days, with low demand. We do expect to see increasingly volatile intraday spreads in most NEM regions,” explains Lara Panjkov, the manager of market applications for Fluence. “This could continue to intensify with a greater penetration of renewables, including rooftop PV, and increasing reliability issues at ageing thermal generators.”
The flipside to low, or negative, price intervals are peak prices – which have been shown to increase steadily in frequency on the NEM over recent years. These can be supplied by the large-scale batteries coming onto the market, including Hazelwood.
“Energy peaking is another strong point,” says McCann. “It offers a potential blueprint for a viable battery storage market in Australia.”
Like the Hornsdale Power Reserve before it, the Fluence team notes that a future expansion of the Hazelwood array has already been factored into its planning.
“There are opportunities to expand [Hazelwood] to respond to market signals in a couple of years,” says Panjkov. “The decision may be made to expand the capacity at any time in the future.”
