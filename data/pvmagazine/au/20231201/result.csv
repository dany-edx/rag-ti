Boasting its status as Australia’s biggest battery, and likely one of the largest in the world, when the Melbourne Renewable Energy Hub (MREH) was approved by Australia’s Minister for the Environment and Water, Tanya Plibersek, in October, her media release claimed it would have a capacity of 2.4 GWh.
Equis’ latest update appears to have shifted this a bit – though it is worth noting that even back in October the company flagged a storage duration of 1.6 GWh as opposed to Plibersek’s 2.4 GWh. Regardless of this misalignment, the MREH project remains giant.
Thanks to the MREH being fast tracked due its status as a ‘Project of State Significance,’ construction on phase 1 has now been revealed by Equis to include three seperate batteries. Two of these are 200 MW / 400 MW. Both of these will be owned 70% by Equis and 30% by Victoria’s recently revived State Electricity Commission, or SEC. 
The third battery will be 200 MW / 800 MWh – that is, it will have four hours of storage. This battery will be owned 51% by Equis and 49% by the SEC. It will also be subject to a 100% offtake agreement with SEC itself, allowing the state-run body to directly ensure firming for state solar and wind projects.
In total, phase 1 then includes 600 MW of battery power and 1,600 MWh of storage, involving an investment of over $1 billion (USD 661 million). The company said: “With the SEC’s equity investment of $245 million, Equis expanded its equity investment to over $510 million in MREH phase 1.”
Equis has, however, been approved for 1,200 MW of capacity at the MREH site. It says “the remaining 600 MW is currently being developed with longer term storage solutions of up to 12 hours.” It is reportedly considered flow battery technologies to meet this long-duration target.
Phase 1 will rely on lithium technologies though, with Equis noting that Tesla has been contracted to provide 444 fully integrated Tesla Megapack units.
Meanwhile, AusNet and Lumea are set to provide the connecting transmission infrastructure and a joint venture between Samsung C&T and Genus Plus Group to undertake the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) of balance of plant of the project.
Equis has been in the Australian market for many years and was originally Singapore-based. In 2018, Equis Energy was sold to Global Infrastructure Partners and was renamed Vena Energy. Not long after the sale, however, Equis Development emerged and included much of the company’s previous management. That company is backed by Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board.
The MREH project is just one of a 39 renewable energy, battery storage and waste infrastructure projects worth more than $6.5 billion that Equis has said it is currently developing in Australia.
While the MREH is the biggest of its battery projects, Equis has also announced plans to develop a 300MW/1,200MWh battery near Tamworth in New South Wales, a 200 MW/800 MWh energy storage system near Brinkworth in South Australia and two battery projects totalling 250 MW in Queensland.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/01/tritium-scrabbles-for-finance-courts-investors-and-bans-media-from-agm/,"EV,FINANCE,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,NORTH AMERICA,TENNESSEE,UNITED STATES,WORLD",CARRIE HAMPEL,"DECEMBER 1, 2023","Tritium scrabbles for finance, courts investors and bans media from AGM","Tritium, an Australian electric vehicle charging company that rocketed onto the world stage, is battling dire financial straits. After the Queensland and federal governments refused to take a $90 million equity stake tied to guarantees to keep its Brisbane factory open, Tritium is courting investors, including Taiwanese electronics company Lite-On Technology.
Other potential key stakeholders are rumoured to be interested in investing in Tritium, but insiders are staying tight-lipped. Tritium barred journalists and the public from attending its annual general meeting (AGM) on 30 November.
After the meeting, the Australian Financial Review spoke to shareholders, who told the paper that Tritium revealed only that there had been confidential discussions with two groups but had not disclosed details of either Lite-On Technology or any other potential key stakeholders, including a Saudi Arabian investment fund.
Last week, Trevor St Baker, who owns a 22% stake in the company, told The Australian that an announcement on further funding for the company would be revealed soon. He said he was confident Tritium would survive.
Besides operating internationally on four continents across 41 countries, Tritium is strongly placed in the US market, not the least because of current US government support and initiatives to upgrade and expand the country’s electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Tritium recently said it would focus its operations on the United States, where it has a manufacturing plant in Tennessee. This rapid expansion has come at a great cost, and Tritium has racked up almost $190 million in losses as it fulfils enormous orders.
Electronics company Lite-On Technology, which has a market capitalisation of $12 billion, is said to be eyeing a decisive stake in the Australian fast-charging company in order to expand its access to the US market.
Tritium appears to be suffering from its massive expansion. Alone in the last 12 months, Tritium’s wins have included a deal with DC America to supply fast chargers, an order for 200 chargers from EasyGo in Ireland, another order with BP for over a thousand EV chargers, following on from a similarly large order with BP just months before, as well as orders from an infrastructure rollout in Denmark with charging operator OK, among other significant orders in Wales, Ireland, Hawaii and France.
Not surprisingly, this year, Tritium also expanded its US workforce and raised $40 million in capital before scrabbling for more financing soon after and closing its Australian manufacturing base to focus on the US and use Brisbane for its research and development operations.
Simultaneous to the negotiations with investors and its annual general meeting, Tritium also announced that 33 of its 175kW chargers have now been installed at the SSA Terminals, LLC container terminal at Pier C in the Port of Long Beach in California. The charging stations are kitted out with Stäubli mechanised charging connectors to support the terminal’s electric terminal tractors. The vehicles being charged with 33 specialised Tritium charging stations are used to transport shipping containers. The Port of Long Beach is one of the largest in the world, with 7,000 trucks passing through it daily.
Tritium is also under pressure from Nasdaq. The Australian fast-charging market leader has been issued a show-clause notice to justify why it should not be kicked off the stock market after the underperformance of its shares. Tritium must formally respond in 2024.

The study maps the projected productivity of photovoltaic installations across future emissions scenarios in different world regions.
While greenhouse gasses are well known to affect climate change and global temperatures, the study also shows aerosols have several other impacts, including on global horizontal irradiance (GHI), meaning total irradiance from the sun on a horizontal surface on earth. Besides temperature, solar radiation and wind speed, the study evaluated the role of aerosols and cloud cover.
In addition to applying different emissions models over different world regions, the research also investigated the difference between mono-crystalline silicon (mono-Si) and thin-film modules to find out which would be more beneficial under different future climate scenarios. This is significant, of course, since mono-Si modules are dominant in the market but thin-film modules are more resilient to warmer climates, highlighting the importance of improving thermal management in PV modules. In Australia, for example, reductions in photovoltaic energy were shown to be significant for mono-Si but not for thin film.
The study’s models reflecting different emission-level scenarios made such differences clear across global regions. The study found that, with increasing climate change, solar resources increased in West and Central Europe, South America, and Central North America. In contrast, global horizontal irradiance (GHI) reductions were predicted in northeast Africa, the Tibetan plateau and South Asia.

In future models investigated in the study, significant increases were predicted in solar resources in South America, for example. The combination of significantly higher wind speeds in this region suggests they could be more favourable for the deployment of hybrid solar wind energy projects, for example.
PhD candidate Alejandra Isaza, who led the study, said: “These results aim to contribute to the analysis of future energy storage requirements, help optimise the location of future solar plants, as well as promote the adoption of policies to accelerate the ongoing energy transition and mitigate the climate change impacts.”
While greenhouse gases are commonly correctly associated with rising temperatures, the word aerosol is something we usually associate with spray cans. But aerosol is basically a catchphrase for all airborne particulate matter, including naturally occurring, such as sea spray or volcanic ash, as well as dust and manmade air pollution from burning fossil fuels.

Light-coloured aerosols, like many kinds of dust from ground-up rocks, reflect the sun’s rays back out of the atmosphere, preventing that heat from ever reaching the earth’s surface, which has a cooling effect. But aerosols, like little flecks of black carbon from burned coal or wood, do the opposite, absorbing heat from the sun. This kind of particulate matter has increased by 60% since the beginning of the industrial revolution, and temperatures have risen accordingly.
Aerosols not only affect temperature, but a particle-rich atmosphere promotes cloud formation, also affecting photovoltaic productivity. The study illustrates the way future solar resources will be most impacted not only by greenhouse gas emissions but also by ineffective regional air quality management.
The study shows that greater greenhouse emissions and aerosols have a significantly negative effect on PV productivity, and the study aims to highlight the economic and business costs of these scenarios to prompt better energy transition and climate change mitigation policies.  For the PV industry, the study reveals interesting regional differences in photovoltaic productivity and the need for accurate modelling of different emissions scenarios, something the study’s authors say needs greater attention.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/01/new-zelands-largest-utility-scale-solar-project-starts-generating-power/,"MARKETS,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEW ZEALAND",CARRIE HAMPEL,"DECEMBER 1, 2023",New Zealand’s largest utility-scale solar project starts generating power,"New Zealand renewables developer Lodestone Energy has started generating energy at its solar farm at Kaitaia. The 39.4 MW Kaitaia Solar Farm has been built near the town of the same name at the far north of the North Island. Starting work in late 2022 and breaking ground in April 2023, the project should now generate 55 GWh of power annually.
Besides the Kaitaia Solar Farm, Lodestone’s phase one capital program includes solar projects at Edgecumbe, Waiotahe, Whitianga and Dargaville. While Kaitaia is the first of Lodestone’s solar farms to start generating, Edgecumbe is expected to be commissioned early in 2024 and Waiotahe late in the same year.
Gary Holden, Managing Director of Lodestone Energy, told local media, “This project ushers in a new era for energy in New Zealand. Kaitaia is the first solar farm at this scale and is a key step in helping New Zealand deliver on its climate goals. It is also crucially important to our customers who have contracted with us to meet their own sustainable energy objectives.”
The Kaitaia project is an agrivoltaic project, so agricultural activity can continue in and around the solar installations and even be enhanced by the solar facility. The project is surrounded by regeneration efforts with tree planting, among other elements.

With more than 61,000 solar panels installed at the North Island plant, the farm’s 55 GWh of power annually will flow to residential and commercial energy consumers, including all of the stores in New Zealand’s Warehouse Group, which is signed up to Lodestone’s phase 1 portfolio.
Lodestone Energy is New Zealand’s first utility-scale solar generation company and is wholly New Zealand-owned. About 80% of New Zealand’s electricity is from renewable sources, most of which is hydro generation, and less than 1% is generated by solar power. This looks set to change as the field of solar energy slowly ramps up in Aotearoa.
This week, the New Zealand Herald also reported that another, albeit smaller, solar farm has also started generating power.  The Te Ihi o te Rā solar facility has just started generating power in Gisborne’s airport district on the mid-east coast of the north island. The solar farm produces enough power for 1000 homes, with about 7300MW of electricity produced annually. This project from developer Eastland Generation spans 6.1 hectares equipped with 8000 bi-facial solar panels that produce energy for the Firstlight Network grid.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/01/the-extraordinary-story-of-rooftop-solar-in-australias-national-electricity-market/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",,"DECEMBER 1, 2023",The extraordinary story of rooftop solar in Australia’s National Electricity Market,"From a power demand perspective, with the weather mild enough not to require extra heating or cooling for open spaces, moderate power demand levels are typically observed in spring and many minimum (operational) demand records are also broken in this season. However, a key contributor to minimum ‘operational demand’  is the energy yield from rooftop solar. This Opinion and Analysis piece presents a deep dive into the unprecedented impact of rooftop solar in the NEM.
Per capita, Australia is currently the global leader in rooftop solar installations with about one in three homes generating their own power. In 2022, rooftop solar contributed a staggering 26% of total renewable electricity generation in Australia with the total installed capacity currently almost double that of grid-scale solar across the NEM (16.3GW vs 8.7GW). This astonishing growth in rooftop solar started well over a decade ago through very generous (and arguably uncoordinated) federal and state government policies and rebate schemes which assisted many households overcome the upfront installation cost hurdle. As technology breakthroughs led to downward pressures on the cost of solar panels, many Australian households saw this technology as a great hedge against rising power prices through the years.

The rooftop solar phenomenon in Australia has had significant impacts across the NEM, including changing the intraday demand shape, revenue cannibalisation for large-scale solar projects, changing the intraday operations of thermal assets, as well as an increased need for flexible generation through a changing intraday ramp profile. As seen in Figure 1, across all mainland states, rooftop installations in the last six years have grown by factors of 3x to 4x across all mainland states – an astonishing outcome. New South Wales, in particular, has seen such huge growth in the last six years that it has just recently overtaken Queensland (the ‘Sunshine State’) as the leading state in Australia in rooftop installations. However, across the same mainland states, operational peak demand has remained relatively flat over the same period.
As defined earlier, operational demand is the total demand less rooftop/embedded generation. Therefore, assuming that total demand remains the same, as rooftop generation increases, operational demand during the day decreases. Given operational peak demand in Australia occurs after sunset, this implies that rooftop solar generation is a key driver of intraday ramping needs in the NEM across all mainland states.
Image: Lumi Adisa
As seen in Figure 2, the intraday demand ramp (down and up) – driven by rooftop PV growth – in New South Wales in particular (also true for all mainland states) has been growing over the years. This is expected to continue driving investment in flexible resources. The average demand trough to peak ramp in New South Wales is now about 3 GW. With the state facing a significant supply gap from coal retirements (about 6 GW) in the next 10 years, it is yet to be seen how this ramp profile will be met by gas and storage technologies. Recently, there have been announcements of large battery projects in the state such as the Riverina and Darlington Point Energy Storage Systems. Another key development to watch in the storage space is the 2 GW Snowy 2 pumped hydro project; it is unclear how quickly the project developers can bring the project online to help manage this growing intraday ramp in the state. 
On a positive note, this rise in rooftop installations in New South Wales has (to an extent) masked the supply gap left by Liddell’s retirement last year. Perhaps these two events (Liddell’s retirement and recent rooftop growth) are related and to be expected as consumers try to protect themselves from high power bills left by wholesale supply shortage – though this is one for further analysis.
Image: Lumi Adisa
As mentioned above, this ramp trend is seen in all mainland states and represents an ongoing challenge state and federal government and other policy makers must solve as thermal coal assets progressively exit the NEM. Figure 3 depicts the difference in average time-of-day demand between 2023 and 2017 across all mainland states. While peak demand in these states has hardly moved, the trend for demand within the day has shifted (and continues to shift) predominantly driven by rooftop solar. The common trend seen across all states is the drop in midday demand and an increase in the non-daylight hours demand; highlighting the continued impact rooftop solar is having on ramp profiles through the years.
In Queensland, the average midday demand has dropped by over 1 GW whilst the evening peak has increased by over 250 MW in six years. Victoria has seen a similar stretch of the intraday demand profile over the same period with midday demand dropping by about 1 GW and the evening peak increasing by over 200 MW. New South Wales – which has the largest peak load – has seen the biggest change in its intraday ramp with average midday demand dropping by close to 2 GW and the evening peak increasing by about 100 MW. These trends call into question the evolving flexibility needs in each state and what the ideal generation mix should be for the future NEM given the (somewhat) inflexible profiles of the existing coal generation assets which dominate the generation mix in these states. Although we have seen a lot of final investment decision (FID) announcements on grid-connected batteries, distributed storage remains a challenge. Given the current trend in rooftop solar growth, it is only a matter of time before the policy makers look to the distribution network for some system ramp mitigation mechanisms.
South Australia, however, is unique compared to other mainland states for a variety of reasons. The state currently:
With South Australia’s peak demand about 3 GW (about a third of the next lowest mainland state), the penetration of rooftop solar in the state has an amplified impact on operational demand. As seen in Figure 1 earlier, the gap between rooftop penetration and peak demand in South Australia is the tightest of all mainland states and it is only a matter of time before these two lines intersect – signifying a higher installed capacity for rooftop than peak demand in the state. As such, during spring season, when demand is typically lower and solar irradiance typically high, the impact of rooftop solar on operational demand in South Australia is clearly pronounced. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) had for a while predicted that South Australia was on track to have a zero (or negative) operational demand event. We have now witnessed a few of these events in South Australia and at the time of writing, the latest event of zero and negative operational demand in South Australia happened on 1 October 2023 (Figure 4).
Image: Lumi Adisa
On this spring day in South Australia, the operational demand for the grid eventually went to zero (and below) around 1pm, with rooftop solar contributing a whopping 78% of the total generation. With demand at this level, all other generation was exported to the neighbouring state of Victoria with 6% from grid solar, 13% from wind and 4% from gas. Interestingly, despite being an expensive source of generation and not being in the merit order during this period, 70 MW of gas generation was instructed on by the market operator for system security purposes due to the high penetration of renewables. Noteworthy is the utilisation of a few grid batteries as well during this event as they were taking advantage of the excess supply to charge their assets.
The focus of this piece has been on operational demand, the impact of this phenomenal growth of rooftop solar, however, goes beyond demand. 
With these levels of embedded rooftop generation, market prices are also severely impacted especially during the typical spring day. Instances of negative pricing are exacerbated during spring stemming from an oversupply of low-cost renewables and lower-than-usual operational demand.
Image: Lumi Adisa
As seen in Figure 5, instances of negative pricing have increased over the past six years in mainland states. In fact, across all mainland states, 2023 has already broken the count record for negative prices even with two months to go. Unsurprisingly, a majority of these negatively priced periods have occurred in spring. This year, spring season already accounts for a third to over half of the total negative pricing seen in mainland NEM. Interestingly, New South Wales barely had any negative pricing until about three years ago; the rise in these pricing events coinciding with the phenomenal rise of rooftop solar in the state as seen in Figure 1. 
The key question here, however, is: What correlation – if any – is there between rooftop solar and negative pricing events? As shown in Figure 6, seasons with high solar irradiance (summer and spring) show a higher percentage of underlying total demand met by rooftop solar in all mainland NEM states. However, as also seen in the figure, these seasons also accounted for the highest counts of negative prices in these mainland NEM states. Spring, in particular, displays the clearest correlation between rooftop solar penetration and negative pricing events. In 2023, the first two months of spring have collectively accounted for about 35% of the negative prices seen in mainland NEM, with rooftop solar averaging around 15% of total underlying demand. Nevertheless, rooftop solar is only a factor in driving negative pricing with other factors such as energy yield from grid-connected renewables and inflexibility of coal generation also playing a role in these pricing outcomes.
Image: Lumi Adisa
Policy makers have attempted to reduce the impact these large power exports from homes is having on the grid. For example, in South Australia, starting this financial year, policy makers have introduced a new rule requiring all new rooftop systems to install a new inverter control technology which unlocks the ability for exports to the grid from these systems to be remotely ramped up and down as needed by the grid. In other states, such as Queensland, some distribution network providers are exploring the possibility of switching off these exports all together as opposed to having flexible control of these rooftop solar systems. 
Looking ahead, it is hard to see any slowing down of this phenomenal growth in rooftop solar capacities across the mainland states in the NEM. With much of Australia’s coal-dominated generation set to retire over the coming decade, in addition to the existing government incentives, it is expected that price increases that typically come with these retirements will only contribute to the uptake of rooftop solar as consumers look to reduce their power bills. 
This changing energy supply mix towards cleaner technologies, as well as the changing intraday demand shape driven predominantly by rooftop solar uptake is expected to drive increasing flexibility needs in the coming years. The extent to which this leads to a large uptake of distributed and/or community battery storage systems is left to be seen. Encouragingly, we are beginning to see a slightly higher uptake of grid-scale battery storage technologies with some innovative project financing underpinning their development.
It is clear that there is much for the global power community to learn from Australia in this area of rooftop solar connections and its impacts on power grids. For example, NEOM, a city with a 100% renewable energy ambition, has the advantage of building its system from scratch, and as a consequence, implement a robust strategy for Distributed Energy Resources (DER) from the get-go in its central planning and design. When planned well, DER such as rooftop solar can have very positive impacts on power systems. For example, DER resources can keep the lights on for critical businesses (such as hospitals) during a major outage event to a transmission line. 
In conclusion, Australia’s unprecedented growth in rooftop solar connections illustrates how quickly power grids around the world are evolving through DER, and the potential we have as a global power community to harness them for our good; we simply need some flexibility in thinking through its associated challenges.

Also given planning permission is the new battery storage project from Flow Energy. This new 100 MW / 200 MWh Bennett’s Creek BESS system is targeting financial close in 2024 and commercial operations in late 2025.
The Bennett’s Creek site for BESS storage in the La Trobe Valley in Victoria’s southeast is to provide 24/renewable energy to the grid. This location is near Hazelwood, the former home of a coal station decommissioned in 2017, notorious as the least carbon-efficient power station in the OECD nations. The coal plant was said to have emitted up to 15% of that state’s annual greenhouse gas emissions before closure. When the Flow Energy BESS is put into operation in 2025, it will allow a greater share of renewable energy in the network, storing electricity produced during the day for use in the evening. The storage battery will also provide Frequency Control and Ancillary Services (FCAS), which keeps the grid within a safe frequency by balancing supply and demand, helping to prevent blackouts and outages.
“As one of the few Australian energy retailers with a completely renewable generation portfolio, the Bennetts Creek battery project marks a significant milestone for Flow Power,” said Flow Power COO Byron Serjeantson when announcing the project.
Flow Power says it selected the land because of its land use compatibility since the land was previously industrially zoned and unused. Another advantage of the location is its proximity to grid connection infrastructure. The Flow Energy battery storage project is planned beside the Morwell Terminal Station on Monash Way. The Bennett’s Creek BESS will bring a new 66 kV transmission line connection to the existing Morwell Terminal Substation.
The Hazelwood La Trobe Valley area is home to numerous energy generation projects because of the existing transmission network from retiring coal generators. Engie – the company that last operated and decided to close the notorious Hazelwood coal plant – already opened a battery storage project on the site, which went into operation this year. New renewable energy projects bring new jobs and opportunities, as with the Flow Energy BESS at Bennett’s Creek.
“In addition to supporting the local grid, the Bennetts Creek project is working with the local stakeholders through a community benefit scheme, industry engagement and local job creation,” said Serjeantson, explaining that Flow Power consulted extensively with the local community over this project. “We would like to thank everyone for their engagement and support to get to this point and look forward to working together to continue to create our renewable energy future,” he said. 
On the other side of Victoria, located about 5 kilometres from the town of Elaine on the Midland Highway between Ballarat and Geelong, the expansion of the Elaine project from Akyasha Energy has now also been approved by the Victorian planning department. This expansion means growing the project’s capacity by more than 50% due to its long duration capability of four hours. Almost all Australia’s big battery projects have generally had no more than two hours of storage. Originally designed as a 200MW, 800MWh facility, the Elaine project will be expanded to 311MW and 1244 MWh. With a planning permit now granted, this project is set to become one of the largest in Victoria.
Both Flow Energy and Akyasha Energy were founded in Victoria. While Flow Energy is still a Victorian-owned enterprise, Akaysha was acquired by BlackRock in August last year.
