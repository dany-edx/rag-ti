The funding is part of USD 24 million in grants awarded by the DOE to advance CSP technologies, which use mirrors to concentrate the sun’s energy in the form of high-temperature heat which is then used to generate synchronous and fully dispatchable power for electricity production and industrial processing.
The grant has been awarded to a consortium led by US-based renewable technology company Solar Dynamics, and including Vast Solar, to develop and test designs of molten salt thermal energy storage tanks to improve the performance of CSP plants.
Vast Solar chief executive Craig Wood said he expects the funding will help fast track the development of CSP technology which can generate clean, dispatchable power as part of an integrated low-cost energy system.
“Funding from the US government is going to accelerate the development of the technology,” he said. “We expect to see rapid deployment of plants in sunny states throughout the US, helping the country achieve its decarbonisation goals.”
The funding comes as Vast Solar eyes potential projects in the US on the back of strong investment incentives following the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act.
Wood said the Act “changes the game for CSP in the US” and is expected to drive energy cost reductions of up to 50% for the Sydney-based company’s modular tower CSP plants.

Unlike traditional CSP technology which uses molten salt both as a heat transfer and for storage, Vast Solar has developed technology that uses sodium for heat transfer and molten salt for on-demand storage, both of which create steam to drive a turbine. The technology allows plants to be configured with 4 to 16 hours of storage and generators of up to 500 MW.
The technology is on show at Jemalong in New South Wales where a 1 MW pilot plant, which was constructed adjacent to a 50 MW solar PV project, has been delivering electricity to the grid since early 2018. It is also scheduled for deployment at Vast Solar’s 30 MW utility scale power plant near Port Augusta in South Australia. The company has also announced plans to develop a 50 MW baseload solar hybrid plant at Mount Isa in Queensland.
US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said the latest funding round will further advance the development and deployment of solar energy technologies and help support President Joe Biden’s goal of achieving a net-zero economy by 2050.
“Solar-thermal technologies provide us with a significant opportunity to upgrade and reduce emissions of industrial plants across the nation while meeting America’s energy needs with reliable, around the clock power generation,” she said. “DOE’s investments will drive the innovation necessary to build out a clean energy economy and meet our climate goals while diversifying the sources of dependable and readily available clean energy.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/11/provaris-lodges-referral-for-2-8-gw-green-hydrogen-project/,"HYDROGEN,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 11, 2022",Provaris lodges referral for 2.8 GW green hydrogen project,"Provaris Energy has submitted an Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Referral to the federal government for the proposed Tiwi H2 Project being developed on Melville Island off Australia’s northern coastline.
The Tiwi H2 Project involves the development of an up to 2.8 GW solar farm which would power an electrolyser capable of producing an estimated 100,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per annum for export into the Asia-Pacific region. Construction of the project is targeted to commence in 2024 with first hydrogen production expected in early 2027.
Perth-based Provaris announced on Tuesday it had lodged an EPBC Referral with the federal government’s Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) for the proposed project.
“The EPBC referral has been prepared to demonstrate that the Tiwi H2 Project will be developed in a safe, sustainable and efficient manner, pursuing a minimal environmental and social impact,” Provaris Energy executive director and chief development officer Garry Triglavcanin said.
“We look forward to the DCCEEW’s decision, expected by late November 2022.”
The EPBC referral marks the second phase of the environmental assessment processes for the project after Provaris lodged a referral submission with the Northern Territory Environment Protection Authority earlier this year. The company expects a decision from the EPA later this month.
Provaris is planning to develop green hydrogen production and export facilities on Melville Island, where the hydrogen will be manufactured through the electrolysis of purified sea water and powered by solar energy. The initial development will see about 500 MW solar of solar generation installed on the island but Provaris says it could be expanded to 2.8 GW as the renewable hydrogen market expands.

The Tiwi H2 Project is targeting an annual green hydrogen production of 100,000 tonnes, which will be exported to the Asia-Pacific region, with a particular focus on Japan, South Korea, Singapore and China.
Provaris managing director and chief executive Martin Carolan said the company has begun the process of looking for development partners for the project, specifically in areas of investment, offtake, construction and operational support to jointly develop the project.
“Provaris continues to advance the Tiwi H2 from concept design through to the phases of detailed design, engineering and approvals to ensure the project maintains its position as an early mover in the export of green hydrogen from Australia,” he said.
“We are now actively seeking partners for joint development of the project given the simplicity of compressed H2 offers a shortened development timeframe and lower project capital cost to export hydrogen into the emerging Asia-Pacific markets.”

Allup said bulk samples from four drill holes at the Sparkler project site, located about 200 kilometres from the port of Albany in WA’s southwest, had been tested at the Nagrom mineral processing facility in Perth. The results were reviewed by Battery Limits Metallurgical Consultants which published its findings in an independent metallurgical report.
“Some of the early indications are encouraging, and the company’s plan is to work towards achieving a commercial product within industry specifications of the sector we are striving for,” Allup said in a statement. “High-grade silica sand of this specification with a low-iron content will be in high demand for use in the manufacture of premium ultra-clear cover glass production, particularly for the burgeoning solar PV panel manufacturing industry.”

The announcement came after the Perth-based company adjusted its process circuit to improve overall silica recovery and decrease iron oxide impurities, which can lower the quality and value of silica sand materials.
The renewed process averaged 84 parts per million (ppm) iron oxide across all test results — well below the <100 ppm impurities benchmark for products hitting the solar panel market premium specification used for PV applications.
Combined with a silicon dioxide grade of 99.8%, Allup chair Andrew Haythorpe said the company is now primed to generate silica sands for PV applications — one of the company’s primary target markets.
“The results from the improvements we are making to the process circuit are very encouraging and indicate that we do have the right projects and the high-purity silica sands to start with,” he said.
“Being able to achieve the high-purity specs required for the manufacture of PV cells means we are on track, and we look forward to being able to supply samples to potential customers as we progress to development on our Sparkler project.”

Silica sand is used in the production of optical fibre, ceramics and glassmaking, including the specialty glass required for solar PV panels and other high-tech product applications like tablet and mobile telephone glass.
Recent technology advances have also demonstrated that the addition of high-grade silica has the potential to replace graphite as the primary metal used in lithium-ion battery anodes, offering greater energy density and efficiency.
The Sparkler project is one of four silica sands projects Allup is exploring in WA. The company said its initial priority is to grow the existing 73 million tonne silica resource base at the Sparkler site towards a potential for commercialisation.
Allup plans to spend approximately two years building its resource base and conducting pre-feasibility study works with the aim of developing its assets into mining operations shortly thereafter.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/11/market-operator-calls-for-mature-conversation-on-capacity-mechanism/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PUMPED HYDRO,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 11, 2022",Market operator calls for ‘mature conversation’ on capacity mechanism,"The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) chief has called for a “mature conversation” among governments, industry and customers to develop a workable version of a capacity mechanism to drive investment in firming capacity such as pumped hydro and big batteries to back up variable renewable energy like wind and solar power.
Speaking at the AFR Energy and Climate Summit in Sydney on Monday, AEMO chief executive officer Daniel Westerman emphasised the need for a mechanism that incentivises dispatchable capacity as he outlined the scale of what is to be achieved within the next 86 months to meet emissions reductions targets and renewable energy quotas put in place by the federal government.
As part of its legislated target of net zero emissions by 2050, the Australian government is targeting a 43% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030. Meeting the government’s 2030 target will mean boosting renewable energy production to 82% of our electricity supply.
With at least five of Australia’s coal-fired power stations set to close between now and 2030, Australia needs to install 45 GW of new supply by 2030, including about 36 GW from renewable generation like solar and wind.
Westerman said that about 9 GW of new firming capacity like pumped hydro, batteries, and lower-emissions gas generation will be needed by 2030 to unlock those renewables but warned that by 2050 that figure will climb to about 60 GW.
“Our Integrated System Plan (ISP) has highlighted how important these firming investments are to provide a reliable and resilient NEM to offset the closures of ageing generators,” he said.
“By 2050, our central scenario calls for over 60 GW of firming capacity, that’s three times today’s capacity, and a mix of technologies including pumped hydro, batteries of all shapes and sizes, and low emissions gas generation.
“But we simply won’t get this built with the current ‘energy only’ market design. This is why the Energy Security Board (ESB) has recommended a capacity mechanism, to send a clear market signal for investment in firming capacity.”
The idea of a capacity mechanism has been widely criticised with some energy market participants concerned it will delay the retirement of fossil fuel generators, providing the increasingly uneconomic plants with an income stream into the future.
Westerman said he understands that any change to market design is “sensitive and carries inherent risks”.
“That’s why I believe that the design of any capacity mechanism needs a mature conversation between governments, industry and consumers,” he said.
“Collaboration is the key to delivering a mechanism that drives the integration of more renewable energy, and ultimately more affordable energy for Australian homes and businesses.”
The pace of Australia’s energy transition was made blindingly clear at the AFR Energy and Climate Summit.
The audience was told that in the last financial year, 29 projects representing nearly 4 GW of new generation, achieved market registration in the NEM. That’s 1 GW more than the previous year, and nearly 2 GW more than year before that.
And between now and the end of the year, another 19 projects totalling 2.7 GW of generation are also expected to achieve market registration.
AEMO said at the last count, there were nearly 150 individual projects, totalling more than 22 GW in capacity across the four connection stages in the NEM.
“This is a huge pipeline of critically important connections to progress at a rapid pace,” Westerman said. “To benchmark that internationally, California, which has a grid roughly 50% bigger than ours, are aiming for about the same rate of new connections as Australia.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/11/qcells-partners-with-plenti-to-simplify-home-solar-and-storage-financing/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH KOREA",BLAKE MATICH,"OCTOBER 11, 2022",Qcells partners with Plenti to simplify home solar and storage financing,"The partnership will allow homeowners to purchase Qcells’ battery system, the Q.Home Core, either by itself or with integrated solar panels, and pay back the cost of the system over the course of up to 10 years.
As more and more Australians turn to solar in the midst of the energy crisis, and as more and more Australians who already own solar turn to battery energy storage, clear and direct financing options are required. Indeed, such is the demand that in July, 2022, Qcells Australia reported a 194% jump in its battery sales. 
The company appears to be pinning its sales boost on the surging prices, though it’s worth noting the company has also managed to neatly coincide the launch of its third generation energy storage system with the crisis.
Plenti’s head of renewable energy, Louis Edwards, said the partnership will enable “more affordable solar battery systems and faster and fairer finance.”
“Accelerating Australia’s renewable energy transition requires industry stakeholders to work together to make customer propositions simple and easy to understand – this partnership with Qcells does just that,” Edwards added.
In a company statement, Qcells said the need for customer solutions that make the decision to switch to solar and storage simple are key to accelerating uptake.
Qcells general manager and business leader for the company’s Arcstream VPP, Mick Fell, said that the bill shock experienced by many consumers as a result of the energy crisis shows no signs of stopping any time soon, nor for that matter is the price of solar panel and battery systems likely to resume the continuous fall in cost seen before the crisis.
“With all this in mind,” says Fell, “the sooner that customers are able to make the switch to solar with storage, the better – for their wallet and for the planet.”
Fell added that customers could also combine their financial repayments with a VPP connected energy plan to lessen the impact of their energy bill even further. “This massive simplification of acquiring and managing renewable energy is key to enabling more Australians to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and insulate against a turbulent energy market,” said Fell.
The Q.Home Core boasts longer warranties at 15 years and cheaper pricing than Australia’s sweetheart, the Tesla Powerwall – offering customers a battery and inverter system for around $12,000 versus Tesla’s $14,650 for the battery only.
The company’s Q.Home Core has also been added to the approved product list for Solar Victoria’s virtual power plant (VPP) pilot.

Attaching a solar array to a home is a long-term commitment, with many considerations, and one that offers great potential for energy bill savings. A recent addition to the list of options is whether or not to attach a battery energy storage system.
A battery can often add $15,000 (USD 10,000) or more to the total cost of a residential solar system, according to EnergySage. But it comes with a range of benefits that vary depending on the home’s electricity needs and experience with the utility company. So, what are the benefits?
Backup power
Blackouts or power outages occur with varied frequency and for different reasons, depending on location. Some regions experience transmission issues on the grid, weather events can knock out power, and some regions like southern California have scheduled rolling blackouts during high energy-demand periods.
A SunPower-backed survey of 1,500 homeowners found that 40% of respondents worried about power outages on a monthly basis. And one-third of respondents said high-profile outages, like the ones caused by winter storms in Texas this past February, are the top reason for considering energy storage.
The next logical question might be: how much battery to install, and for how long should it provide backup?
Installers typically give the choice between whole-home backup, which often require the installation of multiple batteries, or a partial backup, which allows the homeowner to select specific circuits that are tied to desired appliances or outlets. When selecting specific breakers, homeowners often select the refrigerator, garage door opener, home office, or other kitchen appliances.
To understand a home’s power needs, and to evaluate what is most essential to back-up, homeowners can use the Department of Energy’s Energy Saver appliance energy calculator.
One of the most common home batteries is the Tesla Powerwall, which has a 13.5 kWh usable storage capacity. This means it can provide 13.5 kW for one hour, or 1 kW for 13.5 hours, said EnergySage. A second big energy storage brand is from LG Chem, which has  9.6 kWh and 16 kWh models.
Translated to appliances, EnergySage said 13.5 kWh is equivalent to running a 3,500 W air source heat pump for just under four hours, a 200 W refrigerator for 67.5 hours, or five 20 W light bulbs for 135 hours.
EnergySage said a PowerWall can typically back up essentials like WiFi, phone, refrigerator, and some lights for about 24 hours.
Simulations by the US Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory of residential solar and storage systems operated for backup power purposes suggest that a system with a 7 kW pv array and 10 kWh of storage could support 60% to 80% of a customer’s average daily load over the course of a year, depending on the region.
Plus, if the sun is still shining, a battery-connected solar array will continue to produce and store electricity. Solar arrays without a battery must power down during an outage, for safety reasons. Without a battery to store the power, there is no safe place for the power to go, so the system must use a rapid shut down device (the grid is inaccessible as it’s being repaired).
Solar installers will typically work with a homeowner to determine backup needs, and will evaluate the readiness of the home’s main electrical panel to be integrated for backup. In some cases, the installer will call for a main panel upgrade to accommodate the battery, Doing this may come at an additional cost.
Smarter, more valuable  
Without a battery, a grid-tied home solar array will export any unused power directly to the grid in real-time. With a battery, electricity can be charged and discharged in ways that optimize energy bill savings.
Take demand charges, for instance. Some utilities, including providers in Massachusetts, Arizona, and Illinois, charge an additional fee based on the maximum amount of power required over a single hour, or 15-minute period, in a given month. A battery can be scheduled to discharge power during peak use times so that peak energy demand is smoothed, and demand charges are lower.
Utilities also use a billing design called time-of-use, which, similarly to demand charges, are intended to discourage power use during peak demand periods. For example, a utility may charge a lower rate of USD 0.15/kWh during off-peak hours, and then increase the rate to USD 0.32/kWh.
With a battery, the home is able to store energy during off-peak hours, which typically occur during the day when the solar array is producing the most. The battery can then export power to the home during on-peak hours, which are often in the evening as people return from work and run appliances and the array produces less power. Without a battery, homeowners are subject to whatever rate is being charged if the array is not actively producing.
A third benefit is the ability of the battery to provide value in utilities without net metering. Net metering is the process of exporting energy to the power grid in exchange for credits that can be used to offset utility bill costs.
Some utilities offer a one-to-one value, meaning each kWh of power sent out will cover one kWh of utility bill costs. Others have a decreased value for net metering. 
For example, power may be billed by the utility at USD 0.16/kWh, but the value of exported energy only offers a credit value of USD 0.08/kWh. Other utilities offer no net metering credit whatsoever, like in Hawaii, where battery attachment rates are much higher than the rest of the United States at 80%. Again, in the net metering scenario, batteries are able to store and provide power, limiting exposure to the value loss in poor net metering climates.
Cost factors
A lithium-ion home battery comes with a sizeable price tag, usually around USD 10,000. Currently, energy storage that is paired with a residential solar system is eligible for the 26% federal investment tax credit.
Certain states and utilities offer additional incentives for including batteries, and in some cases the value adder can make a dramatic difference. The SMART program in Massachusetts, the Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) of California, and incentive programs in Maryland and Long Island provide up-front cost relief for batteries.
Programs like ConnectedSolutions of New England offer further savings to homeowners who opt-in to a “bring-your-own-battery” program, wherein an incentive is paid to homeowner who agree to allow their batteries to export power to the grid during times of extreme peak demand.
In addition to the ticket-price of the battery, there may be hardware costs associated, as well. Tesla estimates supporting hardware for the battery costs USD 1,100, and installation will range from USD 800 to USD 2,000. Electrical work like a main panel upgrade may drive costs higher, and some installers will require the customer to cover costs like permit fees or retailer/connection charges, said EnergySage.
Retrofit later?
Bloomberg’s New Energy Finance reports lithium-ion battery pack prices have fallen 87% from 2010 to 2019. With global supply chains ramping up lithium production due to increased demand (also driven by electric vehicle adoption) it is possible that further price reductions may occur. But is it worth waiting for a cheaper battery?
The answer depends, but in the past, the cost of installing a battery after-the-fact, or “retrofitting”, is dependent on the inverters on the array, said EnergySage. Most home solar arrays are installed with AC-coupled inverters, which would then need to be re-converted by an additional inverter back to DC for use by the battery. This means a retrofitted battery would come with an additional cost of another inverter, plus installation costs.
A solar system with a battery included at initial install can include just one DC-coupled inverter, which reduces costs, and converts and stores energy more efficiently than AC-coupled solutions.
Now that the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is law, the 30% Investment Tax Credit applies not just to solar-paired batteries, but also to standalone storage. This has made retrofits and standalone installations more common among installers.
Inverter companies are actively working to make retrofits easier. For example, Enphase recently released a microinverter that the company said can be retrofit to any type of home energy storage battery without the need for recoupling.
