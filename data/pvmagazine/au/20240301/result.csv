Philipp Schröder, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of 1Komma5°, said the transaction is the company’s fourth investment in Australia and marks a significant step in advancing sustainable energy and aiming for market leadership.
“This expansion in Australia is our biggest investment to date,” he said, noting that the acquisition more than doubles 1Komma5°’s presence in the Australian market.
“Arkana fits perfectly with our ambitious growth targets and our mission to create a worldwide one-stop-shop for renewable energy solutions.”
“With our fourth investment in Australia, we are well on our way to fighting for market leadership in 2024.”
Arkana, established on the Gold Coast a decade ago and now operating in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, is one of the nation’s largest solar retailers for residential and business installations with a revenue of more than $40 million last year.
Data provided by industry analyst SunWiz shows Arkana is among the top five companies in Australia for capacity of residential solar power systems installed in 2023 with approximately 20 MW deployed.
Arkana Managing Partner Luke Stronach said the company, with a team of 120, has completed more than 15,000 installs on both domestic and commercial premises across the country so far.
“Now is the perfect time to grow,” he said, alluding to the rapid growth in solar installations in Australia, with the overall installed capacity growing from 11.5 GW in 2019 to 34.2 GW in 2023.
Hamburg-based 1Komma5° made its first foray into the Australian market when it acquired home solar and battery installation company Natural Solar in late 2022. This was quickly followed by the acquisition of Solaray Energy and the recent purchase of Adelaide-based Kozco Energy Group.
As well as selling and installing solar panels and batteries, the company has also developed the Heartbeat energy management system. The system connects to and controls solar panels, batteries, smart meters, heat pumps and other electrical devices around the house, and co-ordinates the buying and selling of electricity to and from the grid.
The company claims that a solar-battery system optimised by Heartbeat can save as much as 120% off electricity bills.
Arkana Chief Executive Tyson Stronach said the central control system will pave the way for 1komma5° to shift from a PV and battery focused company to a true one-stop-shop for smart energy solutions.

Construction of the standalone battery, to be located 90 kilometres east of Adelaide, is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2024, with completion scheduled for the second half of 2025.
“This is another exciting development from our customer that is moving South Australia towards its net renewables target,” ElectraNet said.
Epic said the battery will complement the original 5 MW Mannum solar farm, that has been operating since 2019, and the 30 MW stage two expansion that is progressing through the commissioning process, serving as a vital energy reservoir to enhance grid stability in the region.
“The battery energy storage solution will absorb surplus energy during times of low demand that can then be directed into the grid to help support the consistent supply of renewable electricity to South Australian consumers, and the national grid, in peak periods,” Epic Energy Chief Executive Officer Clive D’Cruz said.
The Mannum battery energy storage solution will feature high-cycle capacity lithium-iron phosphate battery technology provided by Canadian Solar subsidiary e-Storage.
It is expected e-Storage will employ the latest iteration of its SolBank utility-scale battery energy storage system for the project. The company said the recently launched SolBank 3.0 offers up to 45% more capacity and a 40% decrease in commissioning time compared to the previous 2.0 iteration.
The battery will be located adjacent to ElectraNet’s Mannum substation but Tom Forde, general manager of major projects delivery, said the connection process will not be without technical challenges.
“Connecting BESS projects of this scale to the national electricity grid is extremely complex, requiring a high degree of expertise, coordination, and collaboration,” he said.
ElectraNet said the connection will involve extending an existing 132 kV busbar at Mannum substation to facilitate the cable connecting the battery facility.

Now a team led by researchers from Chinese vertically integrated module manufacturer Longi and including academics from Curtin University in Perth has developed processes to fabricate high-efficiency heterojunction (HJT) solar cells, while reportedly avoiding the fragility and lower efficiency results seen in earlier attempts to produce thinner cells.
In the study “Flexible silicon solar cells with high power-to-weight ratios,” published in nature, the scientists said the new cell ranges in thickness from 57 μm to 125 μm and is made using M6 wafers with an area of 274.4 cm2.
The wafer thinning not only lowers the weight and cost, but also facilitates the charge migration and separation, noted the research team.
“The flexible and thin profile of these solar cells open up new opportunities for incorporating solar energy generation into various aspects of daily life and industry in portable electronics, building integrated PV, transportation, space applications, emerging technologies with unconventional surfaces or structure,” Xixiang Xu, Longi R&D team leader and corresponding author, told pv magazine.
The team developed its own control and regulation system to enable a continuous low-damage-plasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process to prevent epitaxy and maintain surface uniformity. It is a modification of the conventional step-by-step, non-continuous CVD process for passivation, noted the researchers.
In addition, they implemented a “self-restoring nanocrystalline sowing and vertical growth process for the doped contacts” in a high-frequency plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) process, which enabled growing “high-quality n-type and p-type carrier selective contacts” for the hole transport layer and electron transport layers.
Another innovation was to use contact-free laser transfer printing to deposit low-shading grid lines. For the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layers, they opted for cerium-doped indium oxide (ICO) and a low-damage reactive plasma deposition (RPD) process.
The team deposited ICO as the TCO coating using a low-damage reactive plasma deposition method, which they said “produced superior electrical performance, including much lower resistivity (2.7 × 10−4 Ω cm) and higher carrier mobility (83.1 cm V−1 s −1), when compared to those of the magnetron sputtering-derived indium tin oxide reported elsewhere”, adding that the process “played a decisive role in subsequent stability improvement.”
The cell achieved a certified power conversion efficiency of 26.06% with a thickness of 57 μm, a value of 26.56% with a thickness of 106 μm, and a maximum efficiency of 26.81% with a thickness of 125 μm. The 57 μm solar cell had  also the highest power-to-weight ratio (1.9 W g−1) and open-circuit voltage (761 mV).
The results were validated by Germany’s Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin.
The scientists were also able to reduce optical loss by optimizing the configuration of grid lines using “industry-compatible contact-free” laser transfer printing technology. “The finger width could be reduced from 40 μm (typical screen printing) to 18 μm, with the shading area controlled to less than 2%,” they noted.
The devices were tested for potential-induced degradation and light-induced degradation, according to the paper. “This technological progress provides a practical basis for the commercialization of flexible, lightweight, low-cost and highly efficient solar cells, and the ability to bend or roll up crystalline silicon solar cells for travel is anticipated,” concluded the team.

3,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/01/solars-heavy-lifting-is-queenslands-ray-of-hope-to-hit-transition-target/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",EV FOLEY,2024-03-01,Solar’s heavy lifting is Queensland’s ray of hope to hit transition target,"Analysis from the Queensland Conservation Council (QCC) shows renewable generation output must increase by 4-5% annually if Queensland is to achieve its energy transition target, with large-scale solar farms, rooftop PV and under 30 MW small-scale solar networks expected to do most of the work.
The QCC, in its State of Queensland’s Energy Transition report, said the state is well positioned to achieve its renewable energy backed by storage objective.
The report, which maps the projected renewable energy construction pipeline over the next three years, shows that there is 18 GW of renewable projects actively in development in Queensland. The QCC said if all these projects are built, the installed capacity would reach more than 25 GW, aligning with the goals of the Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan.
QCC spokeswoman Stephanie Gray said the pipeline of projects indicates the scale of opportunity that government and privately owned corporations are seeing in the energy transition in Queensland.
“We finally have a clear plan for phasing out coal and replacing it with renewable energy backed by storage,” she said.
“Just in the last year, the percentage of renewable energy contributing to Queensland’s electricity mix has grown by 5% to exceed 25%. We’re now at a point where our existing solar and wind farms are keeping the lights on as our ageing coal and gas-fired power stations frequently have unplanned outages.”

The QCC said that in 2022-23, 25.5% of Queensland’s energy came from renewable sources. This continues a rapid increase in renewable energy, which has increased fourfold over the past five years.
Rooftop and small-scale (under 30 MW) solar is the largest renewable generator in the state, reaching nearly 6 GW in 2023. There are also 40 large-scale solar farms and three large-scale batteries connected to the grid, along with six large-scale wind farms and 570 MW of pumped hydro.
In addition to the existing assets, the QCC said there are 13 new renewable energy projects likely to be commissioned in Queensland before the end of 2026, including the 40 MW Kingaroy Solar Farm currently being constructed in the South Burnett region and expected to be completed by the end of 2024.
The report also highlights the 101 MW Aramara and 120 MW Munna Creek solar farms being developed on the Fraser Coast.

The council said there are also a number of large-scale solar projects that are considered “likely to proceed” include the 380 MW Aldoga Solar Farm planned for central Queensland and the 175 MW Dulacca (formerly Ardandra ) Solar Farm planned for the Western Downs region.
In addition to the 850 MW of large-scale solar under construction, committed, or likely to proceed, there is 1.6 GW of wind and 1.3 GW/4 GWh of storage in big batteries and Kidston pumped hydro under construction in Queensland.
The QCC said there is an additional 2.7 GW of wind and solar that is either anticipated or at advanced stages of planning, which developers are aiming to build by 2026.
The release of the State of Queensland’s Energy Transition report comes as the Queensland government is seeking to legislate its renewable energy targets of 50% by 2030, 70% by 2032 and 80% by 2035.

4,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/01/utility-scale-pv-cheapest-power-source-in-asia-pacific-says-woodmac/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,ASIA,AUSTRALIA",PATRICK JOWETT,2024-03-01,"Utility-scale PV cheapest power source in Asia Pacific, says WoodMac","The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) in the Asia-Pacific region significantly declined to an all-time low in 2023. According to new analysis by Wood Mackenzie, renewable energy costs were 13% cheaper than conventional coal last year and are expected to be 32% cheaper by 2030.
“Utility PV solar has emerged in 2023 as the cheapest power source in the region, while onshore wind is expected to become cheaper than coal after 2025,” said Alex Whitworth, vice president, head of Asia-Pacific power research at Wood Mackenzie. “Renewables firmed with battery storage is becoming competitive with gas power today but will struggle to compete with coal before 2030.”
Big PV emerged as the cheapest power source in 11 out of 15 countries in the Asia Pacific in 2023. According to WoodMac, PV power costs saw “a significant decline of 23% in 2023, marking the end of two years of supply chain disruptions and inflation.”
Looking ahead, Wood Mackenzie predicts that new-build solar project costs will drop by another 20% by 2030, driven by falling module prices and increasing oversupply from China.
Meanwhile, distributed solar costs fell 26% in 2023, with the technology now 12% cheaper on average than residential power prices. Wood Mackenzie said this creates large potential for more rooftop solar applications.
“This trend has made distributed solar increasingly attractive for end-users in many markets in Asia Pacific, with costs already 30% below rising residential tariffs in China and Australia,” said Sooraj Narayan, senior research analyst, APAC power and renewables at Wood Mackenzie. “However, some markets like India with subsidised residential power tariffs will need to wait until 2030 or later to achieve competitive distributed solar prices.”
Overall, China is leading the way in bringing down the cost of renewables, with utility-scale PV, onshore wind, and offshore wind being 40% to 70% cheaper when compared to other Asia-Pacific markets.
Concerns about profitability, grid integration, backup, and energy storage persist among investors, even though declining costs are supporting investment in renewables.
“Government policies will play a crucial role going forward to support upgrading grid reliability, transmission capacity, and promoting battery storage to manage the intermittent nature of renewables,” said Whitworth.
In December, Ernst & Young said in a report that the global weighted average LCOE for PV is now 29% lower than the cheapest fossil fuel alternative.
Earlier this year, Wood Mackenzie predicted strong yet flat global PV growth through to 2032. It estimated that around 350 GW of global solar will be annually installed for the next eight years.
