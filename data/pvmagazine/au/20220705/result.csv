The acquisition was completed through Australian Motoring Services, owned by the clubs, which has previously held a major stake in Chargefox, but have now bought the remaining shares to become the sole owner of the business.
Chargefox’s leadership and team will remain the same.
Chargefox is targeting the installation of more than 5,000 EV plugs across the country by the end of 2025 – albeit now with extensive financial backing. 
“The accelerated rollout of Chargefox’s network has broad-reaching benefits, as it allows for further local and long-distance EV travel, giving more Australian EV drivers better access to world-leading charging technology right across the country,”  continuing Chargefox CEO, Marty Andrews, said in a statement. “The backing of such a strong, longstanding partner and their investment will help us to deliver on this.”
Chargefox has been operating charging stations across Australia and New Zealand since 2018, when it formed as a joint venture between Cogent.co Ventures and JET Charge.

Officially, the customer is Stripe, which is making the purchase via Frontier – a partnership between Alphabet and Meta (the owners of Google and Facebook respectively) as well as e-commerce giant Shopify and consulting firm McKinsey. 
Earlier this year, Frontier’s members announced they would spend US$925 million (AU$135 billion) on carbon removal over the next nine years to stimulate and accelerate the development of carbon removal technology.
AspiraDAC is one of six companies in the first round of spending, in which Stripe distributed  US$2.4 million (AU$3.5 million).
AspiraDAC is working in partnership with Australian start-up Southern Green Gas under an exclusive collaboration agreement to produce and deploy its solar-powered modules by the end of 2022. 
Southern Green Gas’s prototype machine, developed in partnership with the University of Sydney, claims to suck CO2 directly from the air using solar power.

It is believed Southern Green Gas will build and deliver the machines to AspiraDAC, which will then begin capturing and storing carbon.
“With Southern Green Gas pioneering this technology – harnessing Australia’s incredible solar power resource and world-class storage reserves – we are currently completing the demonstration phase of this project and are looking to enter the construction phase later this year,” Julian Turecek, Executive Director of AspiraDAC, said.
“What Frontier sees in AspiraDAC is the enormous potential in the range of technology developments we are ready to scale in the carbon removal sector,” he added.
“The DAC [Direct Air Capture] solar-powered modules being delivered in this project are at the heart of the agreement with Frontier, being a global-first use of this technology.”
AspiraDAC and Southern Green Gas say they are currently working on the world’s first solar-powered DAC project of one tonne per day, or 310 tonnes per annum, made possible by funding from the Australian Government’s Carbon Capture Use and Storage Development Fund.

“Australia’s abundant solar energy potential means it is a perfect location for DAC, and with the use of solar-powered modules the facility can operate independently of traditional energy sources,” Turecek said. 
“Additionally, the compact nature of DAC facilities means production can capture equivalent CO2 emissions using less than 90% of the land needed in reforestation carbon capture projects.”
“It is not without challenges, DAC technology is in its nascent stages, and agreements with customers such as the Frontier group will catalyse further development of the sector.”
“This will increase our ability to bring down the costs per tonne of carbon to a competitive level to take removal to a megatonne scale within the next decade, and gigatonne scale the decade following.”

Skytrans, which operates from Cairns in Queensland and services routes to Cape York and the Torres Strait, has said it plans to work with Stralis Aircraft to retrofit its Beech 1900D model to run on a hydrogen electric system.
Experts from Queensland’s Griffith University will also be supporting the endeavour, which seeks to capitalise on the massive boom in green hydrogen project announcements in the state. 
Stralis – a Brisbane based company started up last year with the intention of decarbonising aviation – will design, build and test fly the retrofitted aircraft, which is expected to have a range of 800km and seat 15 people. The modification will include replacing the aircraft’s conventional turbine engine and kerosene fuel system with Stralis’ “novel Hydrogen Electric Propulsion System (HEPS) and liquid hydrogen storage tank.”
It hopes to be doing flight tests by early 2025, and the aircraft could enter service as early as 2026.
Skytrans, the regional Queensland airline, is believed to have ordered three of the converted hydrogen electric planes with options on another two. The airline is targeting ‘net zero’ by 2050 – a difficult feat in an industry widely acknowledged as one of the most difficult to decarbonise.
Stralis and Skytrans are claiming the hydrogen aircraft achievement would be an Australia first, but it is worth noting startup Aviation H2 is also completing for this crown and claims it can have a hydrogen plane in the sky by 2023.

The Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPowerLink) is seeking to export solar power from the Australian outback to Singapore via a submarine transmission link. The energy is to be generated from a giant solar PV and battery energy storage complex on a 12,000-hectare site in the Northern Territory’s Barkly region. The project includes a 17-20 GW solar farm and between 36 GWh and 42 GWh of energy storage.

The project has already had financial support from Australian billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest, and now as the project moves from vision to reality, its developers are rolling in the institutional guns.
Construction on the project is expected to commence in 2024, with electricity supplied to Darwin in 2027, and full operations by 2029.
“We have extended our growing business partnerships to Macquarie and Moelis, as we believe they are best placed to advise, optimise the structure and assist Sun Cable to access the global equity and debt capital markets in order to raise the necessary capital to fund construction of the Australia-Asia PowerLink,” Sun Cable Group’s Chief Financial Officer, Kiran Raj, said.
The project has had a series of promising progressions over the last few months, with the Australian government’s independent infrastructure advisory body, Infrastructure Australia, giving the project’s economic credentials the tick of approval in June. In May, the Territory government passed legislation to streamline existing processes and increase certainty for Sun Cable developers.
 “The Australia-Asia PowerLink is a long term investment in energy resilience and decarbonisation, at scale,” Sun Cable Founder & CEO David Griffin said. “With generation, transmission, and storage technology, and engineering that is proven across each interconnected aspect of the operation, we have the economies of scale needed to deliver zero emission dispatchable electricity with reliability and price stability.”

Researchers from the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) have investigated how power electronics may be embedded in solar cells and proposed several design options for PV devices integrating diodes, transistors, capacitors, and inductors.
“Our work is a review paper, in which we explored possibilities for integrating power electronics onto crystalline silicon solar cells,” the research’s corresponding author, David Van Nijen, told pv magazine. “We envision the application of these innovations first in the residential market or in specific applications, such as in PV-powered Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and later, as the economy of scale kicks in, uptake in the utility-scale market.”
In the paper Exploring the benefits, challenges, and feasibility of integrating power electronics into c-Si solar cells, which was recently published in Cell Reports Physical Science, the Dutch research group specified that their main goal was to explore a different approach to facilitate sub-module power electronics, increase granularity, and enable novel approaches to power conditioning. “We review the research efforts that have been performed on the topic so far and outline the feasibility of different unexplored possibilities,” it stated.
Through their review, the scientists found that diodes are the most suitable devices that can be integrated into PV cells, with some designs having already been demonstrated at the research level. They said the so-called Alq3/p-Si Schottky diodes, which are also known as hot-carrier diodes or low voltage diodes, are the best ones for being embedded in solar cells. This kind of diode consists of the junction of a semiconductor with a metal and is known for providing fast switching action and a low forward voltage drop.
As for transistors, the academics said their integration in PV devices may be more complex. “Since transistor fabrication processes require lithographic steps, it is necessary for cost-effective integration to combine as many processing steps as possible with PV fabrication,” they emphasised, stressing the constraints in combining the production steps of standard vertical power transistor designs with those of the photovoltaic industry.
Their review also considered passive component integration, for which several “promising” approaches were found, and thin-film capacitor integration, which the scientists said is challenging due to insufficient high capacitance.

Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resource has provided an update on the program run by state-owned utility PT PLN (Persero) to deploy solar-plus-storage plants across remote islands in the country.
According to the ministry, solar facilities totalling 5.3 MW and connected to an unspecified number of storage systems have been deployed across 17 islands to date. These include Palue (760 kW), Messah (530 kW), Gunung 490 (kW), Golo Lebo (440 kW), Parumaan (420 kW), Papagarang (380 kW), Nuca Molas (380 kW), Wontong (320 kW), Nangabere (270 kW), Mbakung (260 kW), Kebirangga Selatan (200 kW), Ranakulan (190 kW), Seraya 190 (kW), Kakasewa 140 (kW), Batu Tiga (120 kW), Legur Lai (150 kW), and Kalelu (100 kW).
The facility installed in Messah, an island in the country’s southernmost province of East Nusa Tenggara, was built in 2019 and provides power to 467 customers, including households, businesses, and public entities, the ministry explained. The PV system has a capacity of 530 kW and relies on five bidirectional inverters, 27 inverters, and 590 batteries.
According to recent research from the Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT) in Finland, the combination of solar and storage may help remote islands have a 60% share of renewables in their electricity mix.
In the paper “A review of 100% renewable energy scenarios on islands,” published in WIREs Energy and Management, the research group provides a holistic view of energy system studies for islands aiming at 100% renewable energy penetration and reviews all existing literature, including 97 scientific papers. “Detailed information on actions used on-demand as well as on supply-side are delivered,” it specifies. “In this context, there is no limitation regarding single technologies, energy system sectors, regions, or size of islands.”
According to the scientists, balancing the high variability of wind and solar resources via more dispatchable renewable energy technologies such as biomass and biofuels or storage will be crucial for realising the 100% renewables target. “Further technologies providing the remaining required electricity are hydropower plants and pumped hydro storage, solid waste plans, and bioethanol plants,” they point out, noting that solar and wind may also be used to produce hydrogen for use on the islands themselves. “Bioethanol capacities have a crucial role in supply reliability and provide power in short periods of very low solar, wind, and biomass availability.”
After reviewing the existing research, the LTU researchers concluded that the target of powering islands with 100% renewable energy is technically feasible and economically viable. “This has been shown for several small islands as well as for large island states, independent of their geographic location,” they stated. “The role of electricity will become that of a primary energy source and the electricity sector is the backbone of any smart energy system.”
According to their findings, a 30% renewable share may become possible by building capacity and infrastructure while, for a 60% share, storage deployment will be crucial.  Furthermore, sector coupling will be the final step to achieving a 100% target. “We found that there is still not the same common sense on multi-sectoral approaches for islands as it could also be found for energy systems transition in general. Full sector coupling studies are not yet the standard for 100% renewables islands, and a detailed industry sector inclusion is fully missing for islands,” they concluded.
