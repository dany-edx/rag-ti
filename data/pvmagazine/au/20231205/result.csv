The upper limit of both direct stakes or “cumulative” investment is 25%, according to the draft guidance. 
China is far and away Australia’s biggest trade partner, including for lithium and other critical minerals. China’s dominance in the sector, and therefore expertise, has meant a number of Australian projects have substantial Chinese ties. These ties come in the form of Chinese project ownership, investment and off-take agreements.
For instance, Western Australian project Greenbushes, which produces most of Australia’s lithium, is owned by Chinese company Tianqi and US giant Albermarle. Tianqi also holds a majority stake in the Kwinana lithium hydroxide refinery, which produced Australia’s first commercial quantities of battery-grade lithium hydroxide in 2022.
Australia pinned much of hope on the massive US subsidisation policies, which seek to secure renewable supply chains away from China, among other things. As a free-trade partner to the US, Australia had hoped to be treated as a ‘domestic supplier’ and therefore eligible for the IRA’s generous tax incentive scheme. This still may be possible for companies like Liontown Resources.
Despite talk that Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been working on clarifying Australia’s role from within the US for the last six months, no definitive explanation has arrive to date.
The US DOE draft rules also extend the interpretation of foreign control to include what it deems as “‘effective control’ through contracts or licenses with a FEOC [Foreign Entity of Concern].”
It adds: “With respect to the critical minerals, battery components, or battery materials of a given battery, the entity has entered into a licensing arrangement or other contract with another entity (a contractor) that entitles that other entity to exercise effective control over the extraction, processing, recycling, manufacturing, or assembly (collectively, “production”) of the critical minerals, battery components, or battery materials that would be attributed to the entity.”

The aerosol can explosion which caused a metal bar to strike a worker occurred between May 1 and July 16, 2021, according to Queensland court documents.
The subcontracted company pled guilty and reportedly cooperated with the courts, leading to a diminished fine of $40,000 and and no conviction being recorded. Court documents also note the defendant had “suffered a downturn in work in the time since 2021” and as such had a limited capacity to pay.
In terms of the incident itself, the Queensland government’s Office of Work Health and Safety said: “one of the defendant’s workers was struck by a 4.7-kilogram metal bar while working on a piling rig at the solar farm. The metal bar was propelled into the worker after 12 Dulux galvanised aerosol cans exploded while they were stored inside a toolbox which was positioned on the same piling rig.”
Neither the worker struck by the metal bar, nor three other workers nearby, were injured by the explosion. 
However, the presiding Magistrate, Magistrate Bice, found the defendant should have known about the explosion risk from aerosol cans exposed to heat and trained its workers accordingly.
The subcontractor was also ordered to pay $1,500 in professional costs and $101.40 in fees.

The energy will be supplied from the X-Elio’s 200 MW Blue Grass Solar Farm in Chinchilla, Queensland, Zen Energy said.
While the companies claim this will lead to the 14 properties being 100% powered by renewable energy, it is unclear, though unlikely, the renewable purchases will be time-matched, meaning their renewable share is likely below 100%. Time matching ensures renewable power is actually used at the time it is generated, but this is far from the standard in Australia, though cognisance and regulations are being introduced in the US and Europe.

Nonetheless, ISPT estimates the supply deal will see its carbon output reduced by 14,630 tonnes per year. “When the agreement commences, 90% of the electricity needs across our entire portfolio will come from renewables – putting us close to achieving our goal of being 100% powered by renewables by 2025,” ISPT’s Chief Sustainability Officer, Steven Peters, said.
The soon-to-be renewably powered properties in Queensland include Brisbane’s Central Plaza, Wintergarden shopping centre, 19th Avenue Shopping Centre, Barracks at Metroplex, Bracken Ridge Plaza, Caloundra Village, Coolum Village, Deeragun Village, Green Square North Tower, Mango Hill Market Place, Nundah Village, Silkstone Village, Thuringowa Village and 155 Queen Street.
Zen Energy was founded almost two decades ago, and in 2015 the company’s board gained economist and energy expert Ross Garnaut. The company merged with Sanjeev Gupta’s SIMEC Energy in 2017, although the arrangement was short lived. The name of Garnaut however, has remained, with an executive lineup that now also includes Anthony Garnaut as CEO and Glenn Garnaut as the chief risk officer.

While the majority of shareholders were in favour of the takeover, with 68.92% voting for the deal, the scheme required 75% approval.
Despite having previously flagged it would continue with its corporate takeover strategy, Brookfield on Monday said it will now “evaluate its next steps, if any.” Media outlet Reuters reported that a source familiar with the matter said Brookfield had “no intention of returning with a renewed offer.”

Part of this decision seems to rest on the federal government’s recent expansion of its Capacity Investment Scheme. In November, the government announced it would underwrite 32 GW of renewables, something the Reuters source claimed would have a negative impact on Origin’s future earnings, since the company has played a relatively limited role in Australia’s renewable space to date, meaning it would not be a competitive player in the government’s auction-based scheme.
Origin’s CEO, Frank Calabria, separately flagged the matter on Monday, saying “a lot of people will be competing for renewables and storage under this new scheme.”
The failure of the bid seemingly concludes an exciting, albeit brief, moment in Australia’s corporate energy space. In April 2022, Brookfield paired with software billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes to bid for Australia’s largest gentailer, AGL. The deal fell apart that same year, with Brookfield then forming a consortium with US investor EIG Partners to bid for Origin. 
Both bids proposed using private capital to transform the two massive publicly-listed Australian utilities, which have been sluggish to transition their fleets to renewable-based technologies.
The collapse of the climate-takeover corporate strategy, which in Origin’s case largely came down to opposition from its largest shareholder, superfund Australian Super, issues an interesting revelation. As Anthony Macdonald put it in the Australian Financial Review, “in fact, the whole Brookfield vs AusSuper episode proves that capital is not the problem.”
“A $20 billion board-recommended bid has never been blocked by shareholders in Australia,” he added.
Australian Super, which upped its stake in Origin from around 13% to 17% ahead of the shareholder vote on the deal, has now said it is “open to providing capital to assist Origin as it prepares to transition over the coming decades.” What kind of figures it envisions are not clear, but it certainly will not be close to the $20 – $30 billion figure Brookfield had flagged.
Former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating criticised the deal on the basis that Brookfield’s takeover would mean the utility would be privatised, which plays into broader concerns around privatisation of key Australian assets and companies. 
Independent media outlet Michael West Media also applauded the no vote on the basis of Brookfield’s alleged history of tax avoidance in Australia.
Origin Energy shareholders pulling the plug on Brookfield is good for customers. Brookfield are notorious tax dodgers and energy market vertical integration from the deal wd be bad for power prices#auspol https://t.co/UH6gSTOS9u

CleanCo and Coles already signed a 10-year contract back in 2020 to power more than 90% of its Queensland sites from July 2022 with renewable energy. Later the same year, Queensland’s premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced the government had inked a deal with the French renewable energy provider Neoen for CleanCo to buy 320 MW of the output of Neoen’s Western Downs Green Power Hub, which paved the way for construction on the project to begin.
The large-scale solar farm near the town of Chinchilla was completed in April this year and, in July, gained a battery delivered by construction contractor UGL and featuring Tesla Megapack 2XL units. Neoen said at the time that the battery would give the farm greater capacity and enable a wider range of services and solutions. With these different milestones and existing agreements, the agreement now announced by the Queensland government and CleanCo is presumably to secure the power now being generated by Neoen’s 400 MW Western Downs Green Power Hub solar farm for Coles stores.
Coles Queensland State Manager Jo Brown says, “Thanks to the completion of the country’s largest solar farm and this landmark partnership, more than 95% of our electricity needs in Queensland are supplied by CleanCo.”
Claims of supplying an entity’s energy needs with renewables usually only describe the energy demand in buildings  – without including the energy used for transport, such as for Coles delivery services, for example. This appears to be the case here, as the supermarket duopoly has only just started electrifying its delivery fleets. As these are transitioned off fossil fuels, Coles’ electricity needs will increase as its carbon footprint decreases. Strictly speaking, bringing the company’s total energy consumption to 95% renewable energy use will only be achieved if these vehicles are supplied with renewable energy as well. The first fully electric delivery van was welcomed to the Coles Queensland fleet in August this year.

BloombergNEF said in its latest annual study on lithium-ion batteries that the average price of battery packs has fallen this year to USD 139/kWh ($209/kWh), or 14% less than the average of USD 161/kWh in 2022.
To calculate this average price, BNEF conducted more than 300 surveys among buyers and sellers of lithium-ion batteries for electric passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, buses, two- and three-wheeled vehicles, and energy storage applications.
Prices vary by sector: Chinese electric buses and commercial vehicles have the lowest prices at USD 100/kWh. The average price of packs for fully electric passenger cars was USD 128/kWh.
“However, the story behind this price decrease is somewhat different from previous years,” the analysts said. While the main cause of falling battery prices has historically been technological innovation, this year the price drop is mainly attributed to reduced raw material costs.
Prices for key battery metals, especially lithium, have fallen sharply since January, due to significant growth in production capacity in all parts of the battery value chain, from raw materials and components to cells and battery packs.
Although demand continued to increase year on year, the pace of growth in some electric vehicle markets slowed in the second half of the year, mainly due to increased financing costs and economic uncertainty. On the other hand, battery production in China alone exceeded global demand.
As for the future, BNEF’s energy storage team expects prices to closely follow the trajectory of raw material prices. “We project that pack costs will fall to USD 133/kWh next year in real terms in 2023,” said BNEF. “In the long term, if the learning pace of the previous year is maintained, battery prices will fall below USD 100 /kWh in 2027.”
BNEF said that local battery manufacturing in regions such as the United States and Europe can drive up prices in the short term due to the price of energy, equipment, land and labor in these regions compared to Asia.
“However, as the industry matures, these costs could end up falling,” the report said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/05/catl-staying-on-top-of-the-battery-game/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CHINA,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"DECEMBER 5, 2023",CATL: Staying on top of the battery game,"From pv magazine Global
Last year, CATL produced 37% of the world’s EV batteries and 43.4% of energy storage batteries for a grand total of 289 GWh and 2023 is shaping to be another landmark year.
According to South Korean research firm SNE Research, CATL cemented its domination of the global EV industry in the January-August period this year with 37% market share, followed by second-ranked BYD with 16%. Its sales outside of China reached 27.7%, up by 6.9% year-on-year.
As pv magazine learned from CATL, in the third quarter of 2023, the company’s battery sales volume stood at around 100 GWh, with BESS accounting for nearly 20%.
According to CATL, innovation is the key driver of its growth. In the first three quarters of 2023, CATL invested about 14.88 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) in R&D.
As of the first half of 2023, CATL’s issued and pending patents have reached 22,039 worldwide, and it has contributed to the drafting or amending of over 110 industry standards at home and abroad.
With R&D centres in Ningde, Liyang, Shanghai, Xiamen and Munich, which employ more than 17,998, CATL is managing to stay at the forefront of development in energy storage technologies.
Some of its key breakthroughs include the development of liquid-cooling energy storage solutions with long service life and high level of safety.
Furthermore, CATL has worked on low lithium consumption anode, which reduces the consumption of active lithium content while improving the stability of the anode material surface and structure as well as self-repairing electrolyte, which improves cell storage and cycling performance.
It has also achieved big results with its  passivated cathode with the help of doping and coating techniques to reduce side reactions in high-voltage scenarios.
As CATL underlines, “ensuring the safety of energy storage batteries poses far greater challenges than those for EV batteries, as it requires a much higher level of consistency in manufacturing as well as innovation in cell and system design.”
By deploying advanced technologies including 5G, flexible automation and IoT, CATL has achieved a defect rate of DPPB (single defect rate per billion) for its cells, which is the top in the industry.
As for the next frontier in development of lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries, today’s leading energy storage technology, CATL’s goal is further optimization of product performance including service life, power rating, and direct current resistance (DCR), which will in return pave the way to more competitive batteries for its customers.
In terms of cycle life, CATL has already made and deployed batteries capable of cycling 12,000 times. In 2020, CATL deployed the 12,000-cycle ultra-long-life batteries at the Jinjiang 100 MWh Energy Storage Power Station, which has been operating safely ever since, according to the company. CATL’s stated goal is to increase the cycle life to 18,000 cycles.
Beyond lithium-ion stationary storage technology, CATL is also at the forefront of development of the sodium-ion chemistry. It sees the technology as compatible and complementary to lithium-ion batteries.
CATL says it has successfully built the basic industry chain for sodium-ion batteries and established the mass production capacity, noting that the production volume and shipment scale depend on the implementation of customers’ projects.
According to CATL, there are still many conditions that need to be met in the market before the large-scale commercial application of sodium-ion technology. “We hope that the whole industry will work together to promote the development of sodium-ion batteries,” company representatives say.
In 2021, CATL rolled out its first generation sodium-ion battery with an energy density of 160 Wh/kg and promised an increase to 200 Wh/kg for the next generation. In April, it confirmed that Chinese Chery will become the first automaker to use its sodium-ion battery tech.
This year, CATL has also signalled that it is setting a foot into the emerging field of long-duration energy storage. In November, the manufacturer announced a 10 GWh supply deal inked with Australian renewable energy investor Quinbrook, which will initially involve the delivery of 1 GWh of CATL’s latest outdoor container LFP solution called EnerC Plus.
It also said that the partners will work closely together to assess the viability of “CATL’s groundbreaking 8hr charge and 16hr discharge energy storage solution” for use on the Sun Cable Project located in Australia’s Northern Territory, which is expected to include up to 20 GW of solar and up to 42 GWh of battery storage.
In the EV sphere, CATL’s major announcement this year was the development of the “condensed matter” battery, a type of semi-solid state product with condensed electrolyte and new anode and separator materials, will have an energy density of up to 500 Wh/kg.
This was preceded by the launch of Qilin battery in 2022, the third generation of its cell-to-pack technology, claiming the highest integration level to date. With a record-breaking volume utilisation efficiency of 72% and an energy density of up to 255 Wh/kg, Qilin is capable of delivering a range of over 1,000 km and equating to a five-minute hot start and ten minutes of charging to get from 10-80% state of charge.
