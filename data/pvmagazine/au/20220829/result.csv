“A transition to net-zero emissions industries and jobs is unavoidable,” ACF chief executive Kelly O’Shanassy said. “Our choice is in how we transition.
“If we act with speed and certainty through a national clean exports plan, the solutions to climate change will be a jobs bonanza.”
With the increasing speed of Australia’s energy transition and coal-fired power plant closures being mirrored around the world, O’Shanassy warned that without a clear strategy, Australia is at risk of becoming irrelevant.
The ACF said about half of Australia’s current exports value, worth approximately $250 billion, is exposed to international shifts to decarbonise. This primarily affects coal and gas exports but also items that emit a lot of pollution during production, such as aluminium, iron ore and beef.
The foundation said analysis provided by international consulting company Accenture shows Australia’s clean energy transition can be transformative for the nation’s regional communities, not only providing low-cost renewable energy but also helping generate 395,000 jobs and producing $89 billion in revenue by 2040.

“As the world moves away from coal and gas, Australia can retain our mantle as a reliable exporter with our focus now on critical minerals, renewable energy and green steel, hydrogen and aluminium,” O’Shanassy said.
“We need to act decisively to secure these industries. Australia is not the only nation in the world with the natural advantages and know-how to become a clean energy superpower.”
The foundation’s proposed renewable export strategy calls for government to co-invest $10 billion to accelerate the scale up of clean export industries such as hydrogen and battery manufacturing, while also establishing a target for renewable hydrogen and green metals production.
The strategy also calls for the creation of a national energy transition authority to plan and maximise the benefits from Australia’s energy transition.
That recommendation has attracted broad support with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) last week calling on the federal government to establish a national authority to ensure that workers and communities affected by the exit of coal-fired generation from Australia’s energy mix are fully supported.

The Greens have also backed the suggestion, with Senator Penny Allman-Payne announcing on Monday the party will move to legislate a new energy transition authority when parliament resumes next month.
The legislation would establish an independent statutory national energy transition authority that would put in place a framework to support workers affected by the transition to renewable energy and provide advice to government, backed by a 10-year $2.8 billion fund for “diversifying coal communities”.
Allman-Payne said the Greens will give notice of their intention to introduce the bill before the end of the year when parliament resumes.
“Everyone knows the phase out of coal is underway so we have to put in place plans and institutions to support the communities that will be affected,” she said. “There is so much opportunity for new jobs and industries in the coal regions, we just need to get on with it.”
The jobs and skills summit, to be held in Canberra on September 1 and 2, will bring together representatives from government, unions and businesses to address Australia’s labour shortage.

Treasurer and Energy Minister Matt Kean said the state had received commercial interest to develop 44 projects, including wind, solar, energy storage, pumped hydro and green hydrogen production totalling 17 GW of capacity.
“The response has been tremendous, with particularly strong interest in offshore wind, energy storage technologies and green hydrogen,” he said.
“The Illawarra REZ will help deliver cheap and reliable energy, power existing industries, support emerging industries to thrive and create thousands of new jobs in the future.”
The proposals include five large-scale solar projects, 16 energy storage projects, including 11 batteries, and four pumped-hydro projects. Investors have also proposed eight offshore and two onshore wind energy projects, and three new “load projects” including green steel manufacturing.
“This highlights the variety of large-scale energy projects being developed in the region, that will ensure the Illawarra plays a role as the powerhouse of the renewable energy economy,” Kean said.

The Illawarra REZ is one of five renewable energy zones included in the NSW government’s electricity Roadmap, which is forecast to support more than $32 billion of private investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission in the state.
The Energy Corporation of NSW (EnergyCo), the government-controlled authority appointed to lead the delivery of the REZs, said the information provided through the ROI will be used to inform the timing, capacity, design and location of the Illawarra REZ and is the first step in engaging with industry on its design.
EnergyCo said it will now work closely with industry, local government, local communities and other stakeholders to progress the design and delivery of the REZ.
The Illawarra REZ is expected to be formally declared under the NSW government’s Electricity Roadmap legislation by the end of 2022.
REZs are also being developed in the South-West, Hunter-Central Coast, New England and Central-West Orana regions and are expected to bring at least 12 GW of renewable energy and 2 GW of storage online.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/29/researchers-explore-rooftop-pv-for-pre-cooling-of-residential-commercial-buildings/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 29, 2022","Researchers explore rooftop PV for pre-cooling of residential, commercial buildings","A group of Australia researchers, including scientists from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the University of New South Wales (UNSW), have looked at how rooftop PV generation could be used to run air conditioners (AC) to pre-cool residential and commercial buildings.
The group defined the proposed concept as “solar pre-cooling”. It purportedly offers benefits in terms of mitigating low minimum demand in electricity networks, flattening the grid’s net demand profile, and reducing electricity bills.
“Pre-cooling can be implemented in all kinds of buildings that have an AC unit. Solar pre-cooling in residential, commercial, and office buildings have been studied in the literature and proved to be practical,” UNSW Scientia Fellow Gloria Pignatta told pv magazine.
The scientists considered the thermal mass of buildings as a virtual battery that could be used to shift or shave peak demand caused by AC systems.
“Pre-cooling means charging building thermal mass before peak demand onset by reducing thermal mass temperature and then discharging the coolness during the peak period,” the scientists explained. “This is typically done by reducing the thermostat setpoint a few hours before the expected peak period to force the AC to switch on.”

Pre-cooling can be performed with three thermal mass activation methods: surface activation, forced-air activation, and hydronic activation.
“Whether or not thermal mass activation results in energy cost reduction depends on the AC control strategy that defines the temperature setpoint trajectory or AC schedule,” the academics said.
The researchers identified several factors that could help to reduce energy costs. They include reducing peak power, which is beneficial for commercial and office buildings with a demand charge component in their electricity bills, and shifting AC demand to off-peak hours with cheap electricity prices. Other factors include the reduction of mechanical cooling requirements by using night ventilation, and higher efficiency of air-conditioning units as they operates in lower ambient temperatures.
The researchers said pre-cooling can be more beneficial if the surplus PV generation during the day is used to pre-cool the building instead of importing electricity from the grid. This is because the feed-in tariff (FIT) paid for rooftop PV generation is lower than the retail electricity prices, and the future tariff structures might not have a FiT component for exporting to the grid.
“By using the surplus PV generation for solar pre-cooling, households use cheap or free electricity to pre-cool the building, which consequently reduces their imports from the grid during peak hours, when tariff rates are expensive,” Pignatta said. “Moreover, reducing the export of surplus PV to the grid increases levels of self-consumption, lowering PV’s contribution to low network minimum demand and reducing the operational challenges for managing the low minimum demand.”

Although pre-cooling and solar pre-cooling can be beneficial to the network, the potential cost savings and reduction in peak AC demand are not necessarily significant for all buildings, said the researchers. 
“The potential of pre-cooling and solar pre-cooling is based on a range of technical, economic, and behavioral factors such as the energy efficiency of a building, its construction materials, AC unit rated capacity, PV system rated capacity, occupants’ thermal comfort expectations and time-of-use consumption patterns are some of the factors that directly affect the pre-cooling/solar pre-cooling potential of a building,” they said. “A gap in the literature is the lack of thorough investigation in solar pre-cooling using actual monitored household data, including rooftop PV generation, appliance-level demand, and building thermal dynamics. Such studies can reveal the actual potential of solar pre-cooling with more value than simulation-based approaches.”
The researchers described their findings in “Demand response via pre-cooling and solar pre-cooling: a review,” which was recently published in Energy and Buildings.
“It is worth mentioning that the field of solar pre-cooling has the potential for further investigation in terms of cooling technology,” they concluded. “Grid-connected or stand-alone PV-integrated heat pumps, adsorption, absorption, and desiccant cooling systems driven by solar energy can supply cooling to pre-cool the building.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/29/territory-targets-more-solar-as-work-begins-on-45-million-big-battery/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 29, 2022",Territory targets more solar as work begins on $45 million big battery,"The Northern Territory (NT) government is pushing ahead with construction of a 35 MVA (megavolt amps) battery energy storage system that will help manage fluctuations in the Darwin-Katherine grid caused by increasing levels of behind-the-meter solar in the Territory. The Darwin-Katherine Battery Energy Storage System (DK BESS) will also reduce carbon emissions by replacing in part existing thermal generators.
The NT government announced on Monday that earthworks for the DK BESS being built adjacent to energy utility Territory Generation’s Channel Island Power Station have been completed and work on the foundations, in-ground services and culverts is well underway.
The energy storage system, being provided by Swiss-headquartered Hitachi Energy, is expected to be operational in 2023, with battery installation due to commence late this year.
Hitachi said the system “will be part of an intelligent electrical ecosystem and ensure full utilisation of solar energy generation and less reliance on fossil fuels”.
The battery will support the Darwin-Katherine grid that services 150,000 customers, allowing greater penetration of renewable energy while increasing stability and reliability of the power supply.
More than one in six Territorians already have solar panels on their rooftops and Energy Minister Selena Uibo said the DK BESS will help unlock more capacity for residential and commercial and industrial PV.

“Construction of the Darwin-Katherine BESS is a huge step forward in our plan for 50% renewables by 2030,” Uibo said. “Our electricity will be more reliable and stable, whilst maintaining affordability for Territorians.
“Our future is renewables. This is why we are investing now in the BESS and hydrogen-powered generators so we can have clean and efficient energy to help reach our renewables and net-zero emission targets.”
The Territory currently relies on large amounts of thermal spinning reserve in the form of gas-fired generation to counter solar intermittency, maintain system frequency and avoid load shedding.
Government-owned Territory Generation, which will operate the battery, said the DK BESS will work as a virtual synchronous machine and is the first step towards operating the entire Darwin-Katherine network without gas-powered generators.
“The Darwin-Katherine battery is a cornerstone of Territory Generation’s fleet transition,” Territory Generation chief executive officer Gerhard Laubscher said. “It is key to unlocking flexibility in our generation fleet to better manage the increasing impacts of solar on the system.”
The DK BESS is expected to generate cost savings of about $9.8 million annually, paying for itself in approximately five years after it becomes operational. The battery is expected to reduce emissions from gas-fired plant by about 58,000 tonnes per annum.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/29/california-to-ban-petrol-car-sales-by-2035/,"EV,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 29, 2022",California to ban petrol car sales by 2035,"From pv magazine USA
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is set to vote today to pass a law banning all sales of new internal combustion engines by 2035. Under the law, Californians can continue to drive petrol-fuelled vehicles and purchase used ones after 2035. The plan also allows for 20% of sales after 2035 to be plug-in hybrids that can run on batteries and gas.
California makes up 10% of the U.S. car market but represents 43% of all plug-in vehicles in the nation, said CARB.
The new law is set to spur demand for infrastructure to support an electric-powered transportation sector, including solar and electric vehicle charging stations. Currently, there are about 80,000 charging stations in California, well short of the goal of 250,000 by 2025.
Massachusetts, Washington and New York are among states that have announced goals to electrify their car markets or have committed to following in the footsteps of California’s rulings.
“The climate crisis is solvable if we focus on the big, bold steps necessary to stem the tide of carbon pollution,” said Governor Gavin Newsom.
Transportation is responsible for roughly 30% of carbon emissions. However, carbon emissions reduction goals cannot be met if this new era of electric vehicles are charged by a dirty grid characterised by natural gas and other hydrocarbons. As such, environmental groups are calling for Governor Newsom to step in and alter the state’s rooftop solar policy.
Regulators from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) released a comprehensive report outlining the state’s path to carbon neutrality, and chief among the recommendations was support for solar, specifically rooftop solar. However, regulators from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) have been developing policies that are set to slash the value of rooftop solar in the state.
California’s rooftop solar industry represents over 1.4 million homes, small businesses, and other structures topped with PV. The state accounts for 50% of rooftop solar installations in the United States, and of the 230,000 people employed in the solar industry, as many as 68,000 jobs are supported by the state’s rooftop solar business.
Based on California’s clean energy goals, as much as 28.5 GW of rooftop solar needs to be installed through 2045, according to Environment California. If all this capacity were instead installed on land, 148,000 acres would be needed to support it, an area about half the size of Los Angeles.
However, current policies under development in the state, namely the Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 policy, are set to lower the value of solar in the state. NEM 3.0 slashes the payment made to homeowners for their excess solar energy shared to the grid to a fraction of what it is under today’s net metering program.
The NEM 3.0 bill introduced “non-bypassable charges,” which would add $0.05/kWh to a customer’s bill, whether or not they own solar. For context, most Americans pay less than $0.15/kWh for electricity in total. These non-bypassable charges would apply to the electrons generated by the customer’s rooftop solar array and delivered to their own homes. Regulations make it very difficult, or even illegal, to disconnect from the grid entirely in many areas in California.
This means that even if the customer completely self-consumes solar energy and doesn’t use utility-generated power, the utility will profit from the homeowner’s system via non-bypassable charges.
“The ambitious plan to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars is exactly the kind of climate solutions California and the rest of the country should be adopting,” said EWG President and Bay Area resident Ken Cook.
“But it will require the state to dramatically ramp up investments in residential and commercial solar that will be needed to charge the millions of electric vehicles in the coming decade,” said Cook. “I don’t see how Gov. Newsom can achieve what his administration would like to do on clean transportation without the most robust rooftop and community solar programs the state can support.”
