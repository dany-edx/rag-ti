The project is being proposed near Albany, on Western Australia’s southernmost tip, and at this stage involves a concept vision which will progress, later this year, through a feasibility analysis and business case study with the Xodus Group, where the concept will be refined.*
If found to be feasible, The project will unfold in two stages, the second of which will see the development of “a physical, visitable marketplace” which will showcase an integrated ocean energy microgrid.
“Using an integrated microgrid approach, a working, pilot-scale ocean energy system will be created as a world-first offshore energy marketplace,” the announcement says, though precisely what this means isn’t quite clear.
The project is being led by the Australian Ocean Energy Group cluster, which was established with support from NERA (National Energy Resources Australia), and seeks to illuminate the benefits of integrating ocean energy with other renewables, including offshore wind.

There is already a project looking to create an ocean energy centre, named Marine Energy Research Australia (MERA), in Albany. It is being led by the University of Western Australia (UWA) and backed by funding from the state government. That project partners with local company Carnegie Clean Energy and will involve the deployment of an experimental wave energy converter call the M4.
Alex Ogg, NERA’s Ocean Energy Program Manager, told pv magazine Australia this will be the “first device in water as part of the physical marketplace in Albany,” adding that his team is working with MERA on the parallel projects.
Ogg said the NERA Marketplace project, however, is technology agnostic and separate from the MERA centre.
The promise of ocean energy is neither new nor mastered, with attempts to harness its power documenting all the way back to 1799. Since then, thousands of patents have been filed and as many inventors risen and fallen. 
In Australia, there are a handful of companies grappling with the technology, including Carnegie Clean Energy. Carnegie was involved in UWA’s Marine Energy Research Australia project before the company went into voluntary administration in 2019. It has since bounced back and is again working on the centre, looking to further ocean energy in Australia.

Carnegie’s journey illustrates some of the challenges ocean energy expert Richard Manasseh, Swinburne Professor of Fluid Dynamics, outlined to pv magazine Australia earlier this year. He noted the scale and cost were the most problematic aspects of ocean energy projects, inhibited the technology’s takeoff more than actual technological issues.
“The machines don’t work at all unless they are gigantic,” Manasseh said. “So there’s a mismatch between the amount of capital companies tends to have and the size of what they have to build.” Wave energy machines can cost anywhere from a few hundred thousand to a few million to build, depending on the design’s sophistication and efficiency.
Stephanie Thornton, who heads up the Australian Ocean Energy Group cluster, echoed these sentiments saying the four main barriers to the adoption of ocean energy are awareness, accessibility, affordability and commercial project delivery.
While these issues have set back the technology in the past, Ogg says the ocean has “almost limitless potential to produce clean energy more consistently and predictably than any other source.”

“Energy from our oceans has been too often overlooked. What also sets ocean energy apart is its ability to be integrated with other renewables — from discrete blue economy applications today to multi-use offshore energy parks in our future — adding huge value, consistency and complementary energy to the renewable supply,” Ogg added.
Given that the project is expecting to develop its second stage, the “physical marketplace,” in Albany in 2023 – 2024, it would suggest the project is primarily based off modelling rather than submerging actual ocean energy machines in West Australian seas.
Nonetheless, the announcement outlines the stage two microgrid “will include a combination of wind and wave energy converters, solar (onshore and/or offshore), storage and application technologies including green hydrogen production, desalination capability and EV charging.”
Ogg confirmed the project is intended to have both physical and modelling components, but it remains unclear whether the physical component is simply the information centre in Albany or if it extends further ocean energy and other renewable devices. “There will be a physical plant based in Albany at the Historic Whaling Station, who will host the interpretation centre and amplify the public message around wave energy through their visitation and educational outreach programs,” Ogg said.
“This facility will incorporate wave, wind and floating solar technology in the form of a demonstration microgrid, with localised distribution.”
“There will also be a digital portal, accessible globally, with the intent of both to bring energy transition market customers into contact with ocean energy technology developers and project delivery teams to catalyse commercial projects.”
Another large ocean energy modelling project was announced earlier this year, involving researchers from Melbourne’s Swinburne University, Adelaide University, and the University of New South Wales working in collaboration with Victoria’s Moyne Shire Council and Western Australia’s Mid West Ports Authority. It is looking into whether ocean energy devices could be used to protect Australia’s vulnerable coastlines.

Anthony Albanese won the 2022 election and formed the federal government with the support of a strong cross bench. Penny Wong moved to the lower house and is now Australia’s second female prime minister.
Europe has effectively run out of clean energy and Russia set the gas wells alight in its last act of destruction. The Antarctic Thwaites Glacier is shrinking quickly and sea levels are on the rise, gaining another 10cm in a decade.
Australia has tripled its solar and power in the last eight years and we need to triple that again in the next 10 just to meet the domestic electricity needs. A mega 40 to 50 GW renewable energy and green hydrogen plant is being proposed for Darwin and it needs to be built yesterday, Scott Hamilton posits.
In this hypothetical future Simon Holmes á Court, founder of Climate200 among a long list of other credentials, is head of the Business Council of Australia. Author and columnist Jane Caro, having been elected to the Senate in 2022, has become the federal environment minister while executive director of Original Power, Karrina Nolan, is the minister for environment and aboriginal affairs for the Northern Territory. University of New South Wales Professor, Iain MacGill, is Australia’s chief scientist and the Australia Institute thinktank’s chief economist, Richard Denniss, is now Secretary to the Treasury.
Geopolitically much has changed in the world this decade, says Professor MacGill. “By 2030 we know that far more people are involved in dog grooming than working in gas,” MacGill said, and yes, that is a prediction, he added.
Woodside
“Because the gas industry paid virtually no tax, the move away from gas had very little impact on the Australian Commonwealth budget and the lack of spending $11 billion a year subsidising the fossil fuel industry meant that investment in renewable energy went far quicker than anyone realised. 
“Without the burden of the fossil fuel industry and its endless demands for free insurance, free water, free roads, and free infrastructure – without that burden we found that we could actually, thanks to Russia and the rest of the world, that we could move away from fossil fuels a lot quicker than we thought we would.”
In fact, Australia barely noticed Russia switching off the gas, our economy growing with our population. Meanwhile, Mike Cannon-Brooks moved our biggest polluter, gentailer AGL, to clean energy after taking over the company some years before. Petrostates, on the other hand, have not faired so well, losing both power and money.
“One of the biggest things that happened in the mid 2020s was that country’s which could not commit to rapidly moving away from fossil fuels were simply kicked out of most of the [international] forums,” MacGill said. “And Australia, terrified of being isolated because it’s always been a bit insecure, chose to action siding with Europe and North America at that time.”

In these “exhilarating and exhausting” eight years, Australia has become the hydrogen super power the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) fancied, MacGill said. While electrification remained far more important than hydrogen within Australia, the country managed to capitalise on our unusually bountiful sun and wind, turning them into hydrogen which grew into a huge international feedstock market.
“Is [hydrogen] being piped into our homes to run our stoves? I don’t think so. Is it private fuel cell cars tootling around our cities? I don’t think so, but there are some critical roles it’s playing and prices have come down.” 
And as for Australia’s stretch goal of H2 for $2?  “What happened after 2021 is that we had a growing appreciation that setting a price target for green hydrogen and ‘clean hydrogen’ to directly compete with fossil fuels which don’t pay for the damage they do is the wrong way to frame the question,” MacGill said.
“It’s a bit like saying ‘how do I compete against child labour?’”

But as the world moved away from fossil fuels, they became very cheap with people desperately looking to sell them. Thankfully, international leaders finally began to appreciate that building a world to protect the climate meant nothing less than withdrawing price comparisons with fossil fuels, phew.
To that end, green cred has become imperative on the global stage, with Simon Holmes á Court noting the green steel being negotiated in 2022 came to fruition by 2025 and the first mid-scale plant has been built down in the Illawarra.
The aluminium we’re exporting is now certified as green, “so we’re no longer paying the carbon border adjustments on those exports,” Holmes á Court added.
In terms of electrolysers, Australia found that small electrolysers didn’t really have much of a place, “but we’ve now got seven large export facilities,” Holmes á Court said.
“Five of them are operating in the north west of WA and they’re exporting green ammonia. And Gladstone and Newcastle, which back in the early 2020s were importing ammonia, have managed to reverse the flow.”

“That was part of balancing Tomago,” he added, which incorporated electrolysers on its journey to 100% renewables and is now using local ammonia to enable its green aluminium.
“Those things are going in the right direction but we really wish we’d started a little bit earlier with our critical minerals processing. We’re getting smashed for not having markets for getting those minerals out because our refining of them didn’t start early enough,” Holmes á Court said.
What we did figure out is how to make demand match the variability of renewable generation, with industry now using variable pricing to schedule their loads, creating much more flexibility.
The country has also managed to build 17 desalination plants built in last decade, Holmes á Court said, and they are all working on demand and response, so that when wind and sun is up, they are pushing out potable water as fast as they can, and shut down in the lulls.
“So having that variable demand on our desalination plants just like we did with our smelters and hydrogen production, we now have a very integrated, dynamic system that works through markets and we now have as much potable water as industry needs,” he added.
Finally finally finally Snowy 2.0 is up and running and Australia now has at least five batteries the size of the 300 MW Victorian Big Battery.
With overhaul the order of the decade, the political landscape has not been overlooked. “We’re pretty disappointed we don’t have universal support for 90% decarbonisation by 2040, but we’ve managed to get the Independent coalition, the largest party in Australia, on board with that and there some remnants of the moderate liberals,” Holmes á Court said.
Independents virtually swept the board in the 2022 election, Jane Caro added, “really changing the face of Australian politics from how it’s been since federation in a way we’ve never seen before.”
Spark Club
“It led to a rise in the belief amongst those in the community that they could have an influence and that they did have some power,” Caro said. “There was an upsurge in hope following that election – not so much for the Labor party which realised it would have to be dragged kicking and screaming.”
But ultimately Australia and its political parties realised “we don’t have to keep trying to crawl back into the womb of the 1950s,” Caro said.
Lifting the standards of care and housing in Australia has led to a jobs boom, she added, which has also been spurred by making early education and childcare free and universal – allowing huge swaths of women to enter the workforce. 
“We have revolutionised our economies and the Independents, with the help of many progressive women on both sides of the political stage, have caused this to happen and oh my god why did we wait so long to do it!”
While new jobs have also been created, of course, in the renewable sector, skills there are not without their issues. As Australia electrified, growing demand massively, megaprojects have boomed especially in the top end.
In fact, around the same time the last coal-fired power station shut down, about six months ago, Australia finished the TopLink project, a high voltage DC multi-drop connection from Gladstone, through to Mount Isa, Tenant Creek across to Port Headland, Holmes á Court said.

The project was 5 GW in its first implementation and there’s plan to make it 30 GW. “So extremely exciting project but what we’re seeing is a shift in terms of Australia’s energy from up and down the east coast to massive generation in the north and the economic development zones sucking up all the talent.”
“You cannot get an engineer down in the Illawarra or the Hunter, everyone has gone up north to these megaprojects. So we’re very worried about skills shortages. We didn’t think enough about how quickly all the talent would be sucked up to the top end,” he added.

CoorsTek Membrane Sciences has led a team of Norwegian researchers to demonstrate a 36-cell reactor stack enabled by a new interconnect. The team claims it achieves “complete conversion of methane with more than 99% recovery to pressurised hydrogen.” The optimised reactor solves two problems related to scaling proton ceramic reactors (PCERs): matching the spatial distribution of heat from compression with the extent of chemical reactions through a stacked reactor, and the lack of interconnect materials with high electrical conductivity and chemical stability up to 800 C. The PCER stack is a series of six barrels, each with six single cells connected electrically in parallel. It also uses a newly developed Ni-based glass-ceramic composite interconnect. The process aims to improve efficiency in the extraction of hydrogen from ammonia, methane, and biogas by coupling endothermic reforming reactions with heat from electrochemical gas separation and compression. The researchers described their approach in “Single-step hydrogen production from NH3, CH4, and biogas in stacked proton ceramic reactors,” which was recently published in Science.
Stanford University has launched the Stanford Energy Hydrogen Initiative research and education program to fund the development of key technologies, policies and financial mechanisms. Stanford teamed up with eight corporate members, who will invest almost $1 million dollars in new research in the initiative’s first year. The program will focus on both green and blue hydrogen. 
ZeroAvia  has announced plans to collaborate with Shell on two commercial-scale mobile refuellers for use at its research and development site in Hollister, California. Shell will also provide compressed, low-carbon hydrogen supplies to the facility and other locations in the western United States, ZeroAvia said.
First Hydrogen has said that its two MAN-based fuel cell-powered light commercial demonstrator vehicles, equipped with Ballard Power Systems’ fuel cells, are on schedule to commence operational testing in June. It said the two vehicles, currently being built by AVL Powertrain UK, “are expected to be road legal by September 2022 allowing for trials with major fleet operators. It is anticipated that these trials will be carried out with a significant number of fleet operators and buyers based on the interest which has already been generated.” The vehicles will reportedly have more than 500 km of range capability.
Hydrogen Systems has announced the establishment of a new hydrogen centre in Riyadh. “The Hydrogen Energy Center of Excellence focuses on technology transfer and advanced manufacturing of solutions,” Hydrogen Systems said.
Nel Hydrogen Electrolyser, a subsidiary of Nel ASA, has received a purchase order from an undisclosed Indian oil refinery for an alkaline electrolyser. The project will use hydrogen for oleochemical production. The purchase order has a value of approximately €2 million (AU$3 million) and delivery of the equipment is expected in mid-2023, said the company.
ScottishPower and UK-based Storegga have announced plans to build a series of green hydrogen projects in the Scottish Highlands. “The initial project phases will be focused in the Cromarty Firth region (north of Inverness) and will provide green industrial heat across the region for a range of customers including distilleries and transportation sectors;” Storrega said. “The projects are expected to deliver hundreds of M.W. of green hydrogen production capacity before end of the decade, with plans for the first project to be operating by 2024.”
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said in a recent report that over the short term, ammonia and existing pipelines appear to be the best options to transport hydrogen. “Over 120 ports already have ammonia infrastructure and 10% of global production is already traded,” said IRENA. “Once renewable ammonia is produced, it could be blended at any ratio with fossil-based ammonia without any change in properties (with a certification scheme in place), making initial trade easier.”
Air Products, Dutch tank transport specialist Schenk Tanktransport, and Dutch tech company TNO are collaborating on a new plan to develop hydrogen trucks and a public hydrogen refuelling station. “This project is in cooperation with the Port of Rotterdam to create the largest hydrogen refuelling station in the Netherlands, initially supplying three zero-emission trucks from Air Products, Schenk Tanktransport and other early hydrogen adopters in the Rotterdam port area,” said Air Products.
Sunshine Hydro has launched a AU$2 billion (US$1.4 billion) “Flavian” pumped hydro and green hydrogen project in Queensland, Australia. The company reported that it has secured the land and expects to make a final investment decision in 2025, with energy production likely to start from 2028.

In one of the highlights of this week’s Smarter E in Munich, Chinese PV inverter manufacturer Solis has taken the wraps off its new off-grid inverter. Designed for areas without power grids or areas with frequent power outages, the S5-EO1P(4-5)K-48 series boasts a peak efficiency of 96.7% and features an AC charger and a built-in MPPT solar charge controller.
“S5-EO1P(4-5)K-48 was first launched in some markets with no power grid or unstable power grid, such as Myanmar, Pakistan, South Africa, and Spain,” the company told pv magazine.  “However, the product will be released and available for any market where there is significant demand.”
The system supports the parallel operation of up to 10 units, to expand capacity up to 50 kW. Depending on the system configuration, the PV inverter comes with a rated output power of 4 kW or 5 kW, and a surge capacity of 8 kVA or 10 kVA.
Based on the application, the system is also configurable in terms of AC and solar input. It has a maximum PV input voltage of up to 500 V, maximum solar charge current of 100 A, and maximum AC charge current of up to 80 A.
With one MPPT channel and maximum two string inputs, the MPPT voltage ranges from 90 V to 480 V.
The device, which also features IP21 enclosures, measures 335 x 450 x 160 mm and weighs in at 14 kg. Its operating ambient temperature ranges from -10 to 60 degrees Celsius.
According to Solis, the inverter can work with or without batteries and it is compatible with all top-tier brands of lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries. Also, S5-EO1P(4-5)K-48 is compatible both with the grid or generators as a backup power source.
The manufacturer provides a standard two-year warranty for its off-grid PV inverter series, as well as online technical support and services of local technical teams in key countries and regions around the world.

Portuguese startup Solarud has unveiled a water-draining device that can be clipped to solar modules, in order to resolve dust and soiling issues.
“The piece is usable on panels that have frame heights of 40 mm, 35 mm or 30 mm, and thickness between 8 mm and 11 mm. It is suited for modules with slopes between 3 degrees and 20 degrees,” the company’s co-founder, António Peres, told pv magazine.
The device was designed with rooftop installations in mind, where difficult accessibility and height-related risks make soiling an even greater concern for operations and maintenance contractors. While the device cannot replace cleaning, which remains essential, “the goal is to improve the energy production between cleaning cycles by preventing the soiling impact,” Peres said.
The company claims energy gains of 3.5% on average, with better performance being achieved with solar panels in portrait position, when soiling at the bottom of the module affects all its three substrings.
In a case study, the company showed the gains between two equal strings in the same installation – one installed with Solarud and one without.
“The modules were all cleaned on week zero and we then compared the performance of the strings on week 13,” Peres said.
The company developed and produces the device in Portugal. It is available for bulk purchases, starting at 50 units for €100 ($106), or €2 per unit. Each piece weighs 6 grams and is made of UV-resistant recyclable plastic for longer durability.
The company is focused on the European market but distributes globally. Its main clients are investors and project owners seeking fast returns on investment, as well as O&M companies looking to provide better performance alongside their cleaning services.
