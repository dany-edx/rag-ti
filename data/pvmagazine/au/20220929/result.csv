In an announcement to the Australian Stock Exchange, AGL said the Loy Yang A power station would be shuttered by 2035 at the latest, 10 years earlier than planned. The company also confirmed its black coal-fired Bayswater power station in the New South Wales Hunter Valley is to close down between 2030 and 2033. The coal-fired Liddell power plant, also in the Hunter, remains on track to close in April 2023.
“This represents one of the most significant decarbonisation initiatives in Australia,” AGL chair Patricia McKenzie said. “Today we have set a new direction for AGL. Our decarbonisation and energy investment strategy sets a clear pathway for the company’s future and its leading role in Australia’s energy transition.
“AGL is committing to an ambitious but achievable strategy to deliver a responsible and accelerated low-carbon future. We are aiming to reshape our energy portfolio into a cleaner and more flexible one, transitioning away from coal and focusing on new renewable and firming capacity.”
AGL said it plans to invest up to $20 billion by 2036 in new renewable and energy storage assets, funded by assets on the balance sheet, offtake agreements and partnerships.
It aims to have up to 12 GW of new generation and firming capacity in place before 2036. This includes an interim target to have up to 5 GW of new renewables and firming in place by the end of the decade.
“AGL’s future portfolio will be ‘demand driven’, meaning we will focus on capacity that responds to what our customers need – with the majority of new supply anticipated to be from wind and storage, including batteries,” AGL’s incoming Interim chief executive Damien Nicks said.
“As part of this ambition, we’ve set an interim target of 5 GW of new renewables and firming in place by 2030, expanding upon our 3.2 GW pipeline of high-quality projects to meet our growth ambitions. We will also continue our plans to leverage our existing sites to create low emissions integrated industrial energy hubs.”

The announcement comes days after the Victorian government unveiled plans to add more renewable energy storage capacity to the power system. Under the targets, Victoria would reach 2.6 GW of renewable energy storage capacity by 2030 and 6.3 GW by 2035 – enough to power about half of Victoria’s current homes at their peak energy usage.
The Queensland government has also announced it plans to end its reliance on coal-fired power by 2035 as part of a 10-year $62 billion energy strategy that hinges on new solar, wind and pumped hydro power.
Climate Council representative Greg Bourne said AGL’s decision reinforces that coal is no longer a commercially viable industry.
“This is a commercial and strategic decision,” he said. “Coal is unable to compete on cost with renewable energy, it is also inflexible, ageing, unreliable and inefficient.
“In Australia, and globally, renewables backed by storage deliver the cheapest power, and do so without the greenhouse emissions coal and gas produce.”
Bourne also said the announcement is proof that “coal power station closures are going to happen sooner and more frequently than companies are currently formally committed to”.
The former BP Australasia president warned that governments need to take charge of the transition both to ensure all communities are supported through it, and that we know exactly what alternative, clean energy supplies we need and when.”

An artist’s impression of the 200 MW battery AGL plans to build at the Loy Yang power station.Currently, AGL has 3.2 GW of new renewables and firming capacity in the pipeline and under construction, including a 200 MW, four-hour duration grid-scale battery to be built at the Loy Yang Power Station site.
The company also has plans to build a 500 MW grid-connected battery at its Liddell power station, along with utility-scale batteries at Broken Hill (50 MW) in New South Wales and Torrens Island (250 MW) in South Australia. It has announced support for battery projects at Wandoan (100 MW) in Queensland and Maoneng (4 x 50 MW) in NSW and is already operating the 30 MW/ 8 MWh BESS at Dalrymple in South Australia.
It is also pursuing the 250 MW Muswellbrook Pumped Hydro project in the NSW Hunter Valley. The proposed project, being developed by AGL in collaboration with Idemitsu Australia, will see an existing coal mine void transformed into a 250 MW pumped hydro site with eight hours of storage capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/29/queensland-warned-more-work-needed-to-deliver-energy-transition/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,POLICY,PUMPED HYDRO,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2022",Queensland warned more work needed to deliver energy transition,"The Queensland government has unveiled an ambitious energy plan which includes new renewable energy targets — of 70% by 2032 and 80% by 2035 — while the state’s coal-fired powers stations will be progressively transformed into “clean energy hubs” from 2027.
The Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan also includes the world’s largest pumped hydro scheme, a 5 GW facility with 24 hours of storage to be built near Mackay in central Queensland. A second 2 GW pumped hydro scheme is to be built near Gympie.
The state’s new clean energy plan also includes a new ‘SuperGrid’ which will comprise about 1,500 kilometres of 500 kV transmission lines stretching from Brisbane to north Queensland and west to Hughenden to support 22 GW of new wind and new solar.

Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the $62 billion plan will be funded by the public and private sectors with the state government already committing $6 billion, including a “down payment of $4 billion committed by our government over the next four years”.
Palaszczuk said the plan would require significant government investment, but it would leverage enormous private sector investment.
“The plan is $62 billion. We have a $6 billion down payment on that … we’ve already got $11 billion worth of private investment coming in,” she said on Thursday.
“But there will be even more coming in as well. So roughly, it will be around, over $30 billion, between $30 billion and $40 billion we’re providing, but we’re seeking partnerships from the federal government.”
Queensland Resources Council chief executive Ian Macfarlane acknowledged the clean energy plan “provides enormous opportunities in the resources sector” but warned the state government could struggle to attract investors, pointing to a recent increase in coal royalties as cause for concern.
“Obviously, investor confidence has been shaken very badly by the sudden increase in royalties in Queensland and to get investors in here will be one of the challenges in terms of ensuring that renewable energy structures are opened,” he said. “Queensland is cementing a reputation as a higher-risk jurisdiction where the rules of engagement can change suddenly without warning.”

The Australian Energy Council (AEC) said that the ability to encourage private sector investment alongside state-funded projects would be critical to the success of the energy plan.
“We note very major investments will be made by publicly owned businesses which will unavoidably have some impacts on investor confidence,” AEC general manager Ben Barnes said.
“It is important state-based approaches are well coordinated, phased and able to adapt to changes in the market.”
Clean Energy Council chief executive Kane Thornton said he doubted the state government would have any issues in attracting funding for the plan.
“The Queensland government is in a very strong and attractive position in terms of their ownership of a lot of parts of the energy infrastructure here in Queensland,” he said. “That allows them to be able to attract investment and put in some funding commitment as the government has put on the table today.
“Private sector investors are enthusiastic to invest in clean energy — it’s the lowest cost form of investment.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/29/study-shows-nextrackers-machine-learning-software-improves-solar-plant-output/,"RACKING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2022",Study shows Nextracker’s machine learning software improves solar plant output,"From pv magazine USA
Nextracker LLC, a specialist in smart solar trackers, has published a white paper based on third-party analysis showing how Nextracker’s machine-learning software improves utility-scale solar power plant performance. In a series of tests conducted at operational sites in three states, it was found that TrueCapture increased annual energy production by hundreds of thousands of megawatt hours per year.
“TrueCapture gains are predictable and bankable, providing asset owners with gigawatt-hours of additional production and millions of dollars in additional revenue,” said Dan Shugar, founder and CEO of Nextracker. “Our trackers come with embedded communication and control capabilities, so we can provide our TrueCapture and NX Navigator control software both to our customers’ existing installed fleet as well as their new projects. Split-boost, added last year further enhanced TrueCapture performance.”
What sets Nextracker’s decentralised architecture apart from linked-row tracker designs is how it allows for highly granular row-level control and optimisation. Each row in a Nextracker system is powered by its own solar module, battery, actuator and controller, so intelligent independent-row operation is possible. Furthermore, at the control level, the network components required to monitor, command and optimise each single-axis tracker row are all located on the project site. Nextracker’s hardware is wirelessly controlled by the NX Data Hub, a Linux-based industrial computer. And because it is locally powered and controlled, both hardware and software are secure from AC power outages and loss of external communications. The way the tracker works is that TrueCapture adjusts the position of each individual Nextracker row by dispatching real-time tracking parameters in response to site-specific conditions. Informed by sensor data and machine learning technologies, this enables TrueCapture to precisely orient tracker rows to account for terrain variance, construction tolerance, cell technology and weather patterns.
The paper reviewed longitudinal data across three operating projects in California, Georgia and New Mexico, whose output averages over 2% in production benefit. At these sites, the performance of TrueCapture-equipped trackers was tested against a set of control blocks using standard backtracking.
The 40 MWac California site, which is in the Mojave Desert, is one of five power stations that make up the larger 250 MWac Beacon Solar Project portfolio. Commissioned in 2017, the Beacon 5 solar power station integrates full-cell crystalline silicon PV modules and Nextracker’s flagship NX Horizon single-axis trackers. The site has a ground coverage ratio of 50.5% and an average diffuse irradiance percentage of 26.4%. Beacon 5 has significant shading while operating with standard backtracking algorithms. To mitigate the impacts of terrain shading, Nextracker proposed implementing TrueCapture’s yield-enhancing algorithms. Independent performance engineers at Black & Veatch validated TrueCapture’s performance gains, noting in its follow-up engineering report, a 2.2% increase in energy yield for the TrueCapture group relative to the control group.
The 120 MWac New Mexico installation is located on 840 acres. Called the Bluemex solar project,  it integrates full-cell crystalline silicon PV modules on NX Horizon single-axis trackers.  Unlike the California site, the New Mexico site is relatively flat, however, it experiences extreme moisture on a seasonal basis. Nextracker estimated that the site would see a boost of 0.64% by implementing TrueCapture, with gains of 0.3% coming from Nextracker’s Diffuse Boost and 0.34% from Shade Avoid. At the end of the test period, performance engineers found that the Diffuse Boost module provided measured gains of 0.31% and the Shade Avoid mode resulted in an average gain of 0.32% for the test blocks that best matched the site’s average slope number. Overall, TrueCapture provided measured gains of 0.63%.
The 102.5 MWac site in southwest Georgia, called Bancroft Station, supplies 100% renewable energy to Facebook’s Newton Data Center. This dual-use site co-locates solar generation with regenerative agricultural practices, therefore Silicon Ranch did minimal grading to minimize negative impacts to the topsoil. In addition to using TrueCapture controlled single-axis trackers, the Bancroft Station site integrates half-cell crystalline silicon PV modules that Silicon Ranch sourced locally from a Hanwha Q Cells factory in Belton, Georgia. In a Split Boost test conducted in June 2021, performance engineers calculated that half-cell optimization algorithm improved performance by 1.7% relative to standard backtracking on a median sloped test block over a 12-month period.
By reviewing empirical gains for three real-world projects, independent engineers validated TrueCapture’s project yield enhancements and have accounted for these gains as part of a bankable independent energy yield assessment.
More details on the tests are available in the white paper, Enhancing Energy Yields with TrueCapture Using Nextracker’s Proven Intelligent Control Capabilities to Optimize Solar Project Financing and Plant Performance.
