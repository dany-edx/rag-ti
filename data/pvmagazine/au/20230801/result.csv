A joint venture between Octopus Australia, a subsidiary of UK-based global fund manager Octopus Group, and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), the Blind Creek project is being developed near Bungendore in southeast NSW.
Construction of the estimated $450 million (USD 300 million) project is forecast to commence in the second half of 2024 with the asset set to come online in 2026.
Octopus said the start of construction will be largely driven by the network connection process which it is now working through in parallel with the procurement process for both the solar and battery.
The Blind Creek solar and battery project is being developed on pastoral land about 8km north of Bungendore. Octopus said the site, strategically located between the major load centres of Sydney and Canberra, is on a strong part of the transmission network.
The facility will connect into an existing 330 kV transmission line that crosses the project site and the developers expect to use the combination of solar and storage to write “innovative power purchase agreements shaped to the usage of large energy users in NSW.”
The project, which was awarded the Clean Energy Council’s 2022 Community Engagement Award that celebrates excellence in the renewable energy industry, has been planned to co-exist with agricultural activities. The solar arrays will be designed to facilitate rotational grazing of sheep and the panel spacing will allow for tractor access.
“We believe hybrid solar, storage and agriculture projects are the best way to optimise firmed generation and land usage,” Octopus Australia Head of Investment and Development Sonia Teitel said. “We are excited to progress Blind Creek Solar Farm to achieve its next major development milestones.”
The Blind Creek project is the latest for the Octopus Australia and CEFC joint venture which was first announced in August 2021. Among the JV’s projects is the Fulham solar and storage project being developed in eastern Victoria.
Teitel said the Fulham project, which would combine 80 MW of solar with an 80 MW/100 MWh DC-coupled battery, was recently awarded a VRET2 contract and is scheduled to be the “first firmed renewable energy plant connected in Australia.”

Sydney Water said the high-tech plant will use renewable energy to harness industry-leading water recycling technology to supply water services to 400,000 new dwellings in the rapidly growing Western Sydney Aerotropolis growth area. The facility, which will also service parts of the Camden, Penrith and Liverpool LGAs, will help cater for growth until 2056.
A new 4 MW solar array to be constructed at the Kemp Creek site will power the water recycling plant with the solar farm expected to generate approximately 8 GWh of energy per annum, or enough to power approximately 1,400 households for an entire year.
Sydney Water said the solar array will power the facility in the early years and as energy requirements grow, a circular economy precinct featuring bio-gas energy will be constructed to help meet future power needs.
“This facility will use state-of-the-art technology to provide wastewater services and high-quality recycled water for a range of reuse applications locally,” Sydney Water Managing Director Roch Cheroux said.
“When operating at maximum capacity, it will treat around 70 megalitres of wastewater each day and produce advanced-quality treated water for sustainable use in homes and businesses across western Sydney and biosolid products for use in agriculture.”
The Upper South Creek Advanced Water Recycling plant is due to be operational in 2026.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/01/lightweight-solar-panel-provides-solution-for-rooftop-install/,"INSTALLATIONS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 1, 2023",Lightweight solar panel provides solution for rooftop install,"Brisbane-headquartered UV Solar has installed a 9.135 kW solar power system atop a local church in the Queensland capital’s outer suburbs. The installation features Goodwe’s new lightweight Galaxy 315 W solar panels, accompanied by the Chinese manufacturer’s 10 kW SDT inverters and an electric vehicle charger.
The owners of Rock’s Church had been seeking to install a rooftop solar system at the facility to counter rising electricity bills but an assessment determined the building’s ageing roof, which had undergone repairs due to leakage issues, was not suitable to host a traditional rooftop system.
UV Solar opted instead to use GoodWe’s frameless Galaxy 315 W solar panel. Weighing less than 6 kg per m2, the panel can be adhered to the roof surface without the need for drilling, making it suitable for installing on roofs with a low load-bearing capacity and poor waterproofing.
“We’ve been working closely with GoodWe for over four years now, and we’ve built a solid trust in the quality of their products and sales service,” a UV Power spokesman said.
“Even though it is our first experience with their Galaxy Series, we found the product incredibly easy to install. We secured them to the roof within just five minutes.”

Apollo Chai, head of BIPV marketing at GoodWe Australia, said the inclusion of the Galaxy series in the manufacturer’s product portfolio makes it a more comprehensive energy solution provider.
“Over 25% of rooftops in Australia cannot be installed with traditional solar panels and mounting systems, due to the risk of weather damage and structural integrity being compromised,” he said. “The Galaxy series of panels is the ideal solution for these scenarios, especially for commercial property owners who are looking for solar solutions to reduce operational costs at a time when energy prices are increasing.”
The panels measure 2,116 mm × 777 mm × 4 mm and are reinforced by 1.6 mm ultra-thin glass which provides durability and all-weather protection.
The new Galaxy 315 W panel has a power conversion efficiency of 174 W per m2. The panels have a temperature coefficient of -0.35% per degree Celsius, the operating ambient temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C and the maximum system voltage is 1,500 V. The series also includes a 335 W model.
GoodWe offers a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year power output guarantee. It said the panels are able to operate at 82% of their original performance after 25 years and at 80% after 30 years.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/01/vertical-bifacial-solar-seeking-greenhouse-albedo-and-deployment-space/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RACKING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 1, 2023",Vertical bifacial solar seeking greenhouse albedo and deployment space,"Even in non-traditional orientations, solar panels can provide a cost-effective and environmentally friendly energy solution when strategically installed.
This principle is currently being showcased by Spring Hill Greens, a Colorado-based farming operation nestled between two greenhouses. The unique vertical bifacial solar panel system optimises land use while potentially capitalising on the high albedo effect of the highly reflective greenhouse materials.

The system’s design and installation were handled by Sandbox Solar. While it doesn’t yet have a tool to fully measure the albedo effect without a control vertical system, the company has commenced experiments to provide further insights into generation curves.
Ian Skor, owner of Sandbox Solar, noted that production on snowy days is dramatically higher than any other installation. The project’s peak generation periods are at 9 am and 4 pm, which Skor likened to a “reverse duck curve.”
To help design and simulate the generation curves of the facility prior to construction, Sandbox Solar employed its in-house software, SPADE Agrivoltaic.
Preliminary data shows promising results. During the months of September through April (encompassing the northern hemisphere autumn and winter), the vertical bifacial system produced 559.28 kWh/kWp. This performance surpasses that of a nearby east-west rooftop system owned by Spring Hill by 14%, which produced 489.93 kWh/kWp. However, it falls behind a south-facing ground mount project, also a Spring Hill property, which achieved an output of 857 kWh/kWp, by 34%.

Denver-based Greentech Renewable provided the hardware for the project, which includes Canadian Solar 445 W BiHiKu bifacial solar modules, SolarEdge 11.4 240V single-phase inverters, p505 rail mounted optimisers, and Tamarack bifacial vertical solar fence racking.
“My summary is that the system saves dramatically on footprint and can increase the number of usable project areas,” said Skor, acknowledging the customer’s initial desire to maximize land use.
“The production during snowy days is dramatically higher than any other installation. This application may work extremely well in northern climates that experience significant snowfall.”
