https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/12/solar-skin-planned-for-1-billion-melbourne-office-tower/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 12, 2021",‘Solar skin’ planned for $1 billion Melbourne office tower,"Cbus Property, a subsidiary of superannuation fund manager Cbus, is aiming to establish a new benchmark in sustainable design with a facade featuring energy-producing solar PV panels to be wrapped around the 49-storey commercial tower it is developing in Melbourne’s city centre.
The property developer has lodged a new Development Application (DA) with the Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) for the $1 billion commercial tower set to be constructed at 435 Bourke Street.
Designed by architectural firm Bates Smart, the proposed tower will comprise approximately 60,000 square metres of commercial office space across 48 levels, with 1,300 square metres of retail space, 116 car parks, a sky garden and several open-air terraces. The facade will be clad in “translucent, vertical glass photovoltaic panels”.
While neither Bates Smart nor Cbus Property responded to requests to provide technical details about the proposed renewable energy system, Bates Smart director Cian Davis said the facade will be clad with solar PV panels capable of generating one fifth of the fully electric building’s energy requirements. The balance of the building will be powered by off-site renewable electricity.
“The solar skin system is made up of translucent, vertical glass photovoltaic panels that will help generate 20% of the base building power,” Davis said in a statement.
“People working in the building will be able to look out the window and see where their energy comes from.”
The unveiling of the plans comes after new research from the ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science found buildings in the City of Melbourne could generate almost three quarters of their own energy needs if solar technology is fully integrated into roofs, walls and windows.

The research, which examined the viability and impact of window-integrated PV alongside other solar technologies at a city scale, found comprehensive adoption of existing rooftop PV technology and the widespread deployment of emerging ‘solar windows’ and other building integrated PV (BIPV) could deliver up to 74% of the energy consumption which is required by the city’s buildings.
The research adds weight to a report released by the Australian PV Institute (APVI) which declared the business case for BIPV is stronger than ever, identifying it as a key avenue for increased market penetration of PV.
BIPV is yet to enjoy the same widespread deployment as roof-mounted solar modules that adorn more than 3 million homes across Australia, but the APVI believes the versatility of BIPV means it has enormous potential for growth and “offers huge potential to exploit roofs and facades as a local energy source”.
Davis said the collected energy coupled with all-electric operations will help the tower save 430 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year, aiding Cbus Property’s commitment to net zero carbon, which was recently fast-tracked to early 2022.
“We didn’t want to design a building that would be outdated by its completion. Instead, it will cater to any work setting and scenario, engage with its surroundings, be open to the neighbourhood at the ground, and achieve the best tall commercial tower performance in Australia,” he said.
“When it welcomes its first tenants, it will be Melbourne’s most flexible, sustainable and, frankly, human commercial building. It is architecture designed for the future, which is already here.”

Cbus Property chief executive officer Adrian Pozzo said the “state-of-the-art” development will encompass four addresses on the corner of Bourke and Queen streets and will serve as a “vertical village” for more than 5,500 city workers.
Pozzo said the updated DA is an evolution of the previously approved tower, which was originally signed off by the DELWP in January 2020.
“Our vision is to create another world-class commercial building that represents Cbus Property’s leadership in resilient and sustainable development,” he said.
“With the onset of the pandemic, we were not content to rest on the laurels of our first DA and strove to future-proof the design of 435 Bourke … with a greatly enhanced focus on sustainability, wellness, collaboration, connection to the public community, nature and productivity.”
With demolition on all but one of the sites already completed, construction of 435 Bourke Street is expected to commence in 2022, pending approvals.

FRV has emerged as one of Australia’s largest solar developers since its arrival in 2010. The company’s Australian portfolio includes almost 700 MW of utility scale solar PV projects already operational or under construction.
FRV’s Australian portfolio includes the 125 MW Lilyvale Solar Farm in Queensland, the 106 MW Winton Solar Farm in Victoria, and the  69.75 MW Goonumbla Solar Farm in New South Wales (NSW). The company has also achieved financial close on the 115 MW Metz Solar Farm, commenced construction on the 90 MW Sebastopol Solar Farm, and continues to develop the 300 MW Walla Walla Solar Farm, all in NSW.
FRV Australia managing director Carlo Frigerio said the company would now look to build on that regional experience in NZ.
“We intend to replicate our successful Australian experience in the New Zealand solar energy market,” he said.
Genesis, which is 51% owned by the NZ government, said most of the solar developments will be located on NZ’s North Island with site selections to be driven by existing transmission connection points. The site of the first solar farm is set to be confirmed early next year.
Genesis’ chief operations officer Nigel Clark said FRV’s experience in developing large-scale solar projects, particularly in emerging markets, and access to global supply chain networks had proved decisive in a competitive selection process.
“The joint venture will maximise the capabilities of both parties, enabling us to achieve our ambition to become a leading developer of solar generation in New Zealand,” he said.
Genesis will retain a 60% stake in the joint venture, bolstering its ambition to establish itself as a leading developer of utility scale solar and adding to its existing generation portfolio of hydro, wind, geothermal and thermal sources of energy.
Clark said the solar project would contribute to Genesis’ Future-gen program which aims to displace 2,650 GWh of baseload thermal generation with new renewable power by 2030.

It comes after Genesis opened the 133 MW Waipipi wind farm in Taranaki earlier this year, signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) to enable the building of the 75 MW Kaiwaikawe wind farm in Northland over the next three years, and another PPA for power from the Tauhara geothermal plant being built near Taupō.
“Combined, these four projects will create 1,935 GWh per year of renewable generation, putting us well on the way toward our goal of displacing 2,650 GWh of thermal power,” Clark said.
“We are moving at pace to underline our commitment to transition to renewable sources of generation.”
The announcement of the joint venture comes after FRV, owned by UAE based Abdul Latif Jameel Energy, last month confirmed the sale of a 49% share in its Australian arm to Canadian fund Omers Infrastructure.
Under the terms of the transaction, Omers acquired a stake in FRV’s Australian renewable energy business, which includes 637 MW (DC) of PV projects already operational or under construction with offtakers and green certification already in place, as well as a pipeline comprising 2.7 GW of PV projects and 1.3 GWh of battery storage in earlier phases of development.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/12/basslink-enters-voluntary-administration-amid-legal-dispute/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,TASMANIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 12, 2021",Basslink enters voluntary administration amid legal dispute,"The Basslink group, a subsidiary of the Singapore-headquartered Keppel Infrastructure Trust, was last year ordered to pay more than $70 million to Hydro Tasmania and the state government over a months-long failure of the interconnector which contributed to an energy crisis in the island state.
In October, the Tasmanian government announced it was taking legal action to recover the money after ending an standstill agreement to defer payments to allow Basslink to refinance its debt and meet its commitments.
Basslink on Friday announced companies in the Basslink group had entered voluntary administration. The companies have appointed Ernst and Young as voluntary administrators and their lenders have appointed KPMG as receivers.
Basslink chief executive officer Malcolm Eccles said the “difficult” decision was made because of the ongoing dispute with state-government-owned Hydro Tasmania and an unsuccessful sale process with APA Group.
“Basslink has operated in a highly challenging environment for some time,” Eccles said in a statement.
“Regrettably, against the backdrop of many issues and having exhausted options, Basslink needed to take proactive action to put Basslink in the best possible position to navigate forward through these challenges.”
Eccles said the decision to appoint administrators was made with the long-term interests of Basslink, its creditors and employees in mind.
“Given the issues as a result of the cessation of discussions with APA and the ongoing disputes with Hydro Tasmania, it felt that administration was the best way to effect change while protecting all stakeholders,” he said.
Eccles said the Basslink interconnector continues to operate efficiently and reliably, connecting Tasmania to the National Electricity Market (NEM).
“We continue to serve the communities of Tasmania and Victoria, providing a reliable and sustainable source of energy,” he said.
Tasmanian Energy Minister Guy Barnett said the Basslink contracts contain provisions which enable the interconnector to continue to operate through the process, connecting Tasmania to the NEM.
“Our state’s energy security remains on a very firm footing and in fact it has never been more secure,” he said.
Barnett said the security is underpinned by the state’s hydro storage level which, as of this week, sits at 52.6%, the highest level since 2014.
He also pointed to the commissioning late last year of the Cattle Hill and Granville Harbour wind farms which enabled Tasmania to become the first jurisdiction in Australia to be 100% self-sufficient in renewable electricity.
Barnett said the state government and Hydro Tasmania will now engage with Basslink’s financiers and administrators.
Ernst and Young representative Adam Nikitins said the administrators will now undertake a preliminary review and assessment of the Basslink’s operations.
“Over the coming weeks we will be seeking to assess the best options for the business with a view to restructuring it for a more sustainable future,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/12/wa-miner-to-test-vanadium-redox-flow-battery-technology/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 12, 2021",WA miner to test vanadium redox flow battery technology,"VSUN Energy, the renewable energy generation and storage subsidiary of Perth-based miner Australian Vanadium Limited (AVL), will install a standalone power system (SPS) based on vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) energy storage technology at IGO’s nickel operation in Western Australia’s (WA) remote Fraser Range region.
The SPS will be based around a 300 kWh VRFB supplied by Spanish battery manufacturer E22, a subsidiary of global solar and battery specialist Gransolar Group.
While no details about the energy generation have been supplied, the VRFB-based SPS is expected to be paired with a ground-mounted solar PV array with a diesel-fuelled generator serving as back-up.
The VRFB-based SPS will complement the existing 6.7 MW solar PV array which has been helping to power operations at the nickel-copper-cobalt mine site since 2019.
AVL said the new SPS, which will be used to power a bore pump on-site, has been designed to provide a 100% renewable energy supply for much of the year, although the initial 12-month trial will target a total renewable penetration of 85-90%.
The VRFB system will be initially issued free to IGO with ownership or rental options commencing after the 12-month trial period.
AVL managing director Vincent Algar said the initiative is part of the company’s strategy to further develop the market for the battery storage technology in Australia with the optimisation of power for pumps a key area of focus for VSUN across mining and agricultural markets.
“Working with IGO on this project will accelerate the objectives of the companies and broader mining industry towards carbon neutrality,” he said.
“The robustness of VRFB energy storage makes it perfectly suited to the tough environments found on many Australian mine sites.”

AVL, which is developing the Australian Vanadium Project south of Meekatharra in WA, said vanadium flow batteries offer heavy-duty energy storage and are designed for use in high-utilisation applications such as being coupled with industrial-scale solar PV generation for distributed, low-emissions energy projects.
Energy is stored in a non-flammable, liquid electrolyte and the batteries can be cycled tens of thousands of times with virtually no degradation in capacity. With a lifespan exceeding 20 years, VRFB technology has longevity that matches renewable energy generation sources such as solar PV. The technology has a wide operating temperature range, giving it the ability to be deployed in all regions of Australia.
Algar said VSUN is in discussions with other mining companies and customers in the agricultural sector and will be able to share the findings from the IGO project with them.
“The installation of an SPS based on vanadium technology for pumping applications enables diesel to be almost entirely eliminated, helping reduce overall carbon emissions and providing reliable green power,” he said.
“We look forward to trialling and then duplicating this system based on an Australian invention and with Australian-made vanadium electrolyte from AVL in WA,” he said.
The installation of the VRFB-based SPS at IGO’s Nova site, about 360 kilometres southeast of Kalgoorlie, is expected to reduce energy costs and offer substantial reductions in operating hours for service personnel.

IGO’s chief operating officer Matt Dusci said it would also aid the company’s emission reduction ambitions.
“IGO’s strategic focus is on those products that are critical to enabling clean energy solutions, to create a better planet,” he said.
“We aspire to be carbon neutral across our business and to do this, in part, by leveraging renewable energy solutions and innovation to reduce emissions at our remote exploration and mining operations.”
The announcement of the SPS trial comes just 24 hours after AVL revealed it had signed an MOU with E22 with the intention of supplying vanadium for the manufacture of the Spanish company’s next-generation VRFBs.
The MOU also includes an agreement with VSUN for the sale of E22’s VRFBs in Australia.
Algar said E22 manufactures small to large-size VRFBs, with the VCUBE50 well suited to the development of VSUN’s standalone power system. The smallest in E22’s VCUBE series, the 50 kW battery offers four hours of energy storage.
“What attracted us to E22, in particular, was the midsize VRFB that they are able to supply and the credibility offered through their parent company,” he said.
“Small to medium-sized commercial applications, in addition to mining and agricultural industries, require a system that is smaller than the majority of the VRFB manufacturers currently supply. The requirement is for a robust and reliable system that can be increased in size and redeployed as needed.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/12/solar-panels-host-microbes-that-may-be-used-for-biotech-applications/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,BRAZIL,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 12, 2021",Solar panels host microbes that may be used for biotech applications,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists at Brazil’s research agency, Fasesp, have conducted a study to analyse the presence of micro-organisms on the surface of photovoltaic panels installed in tropical regions.
The researchers profiled all the microbes they found on PV systems located in Sorocaba and Itatiba, in São Paulo state, through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which is commonly used to identify, classify, and measure the volume of microbes within complex biological mixtures such as environmental samples and gut samples. They also used PICRUSt, which is a bioinformatics software package designed to predict metagenome functional content.
“In view of their characteristics, the microorganisms identified have significant potential to be developed into products that entail long periods of exposure to sunlight, such as sunscreens and pigments for processed foods, chemicals, textiles, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, as well as more efficient detergents with antimicrobial action for cleaning the panels themselves,” the Brazilian group stated.
The composition of the microbes was found to be very similar to that found in similar experiments carried out in Spain and the United States, as well as in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. The micro-organism profiles identified by the academics are said to be consistent with the harsh environment represented by PV systems located in tropical regions. “The presence of stress genes in the predicted functional content was … preliminary evidence that microbes living there are a [possible] source of metabolites with biotechnological interest,” the research team further explained.
The scientists added, the presence of microbes is often detected in the dust that accumulates on the panels, and their role in reducing the modules’ efficiency should be further investigated. “As a survival strategy, some bacteria cluster in biofilms that line the panels and reduce their capacity to capture solar radiation,” they emphasised.
The results of the analysis were published in the study Extremophilic taxa predominate in a microbial community of photovoltaic panels in a tropical region, published in FEMS Microbiology Letters, the official journal of the Federation of European Microbiology Societies.
