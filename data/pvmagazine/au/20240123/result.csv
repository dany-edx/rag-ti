The proposed Hallett Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) would have an initial storage capacity of 50 MW and discharge capacity of up to 200 MWh.
EnergyAustralia Head of Portfolio Development Daniel Nugent said the aim is to expand its capacity to 150 MW and 600 MWh after the initial stage is completed.
Nugent said good progress has already been made in the planning of the Hallett battery which the electricity gen-tailer expects will allow it to transition its gas-fired power station to be in strategic reserve, decrease emissions, and support more renewables coming into the system.
“We’re seeking to develop the battery on land we own alongside our power station, bringing some big benefits for construction and delivery certainty, so for example, we can use the existing transmission infrastructure avoiding the need to build new transmission lines on private land,” Nugent said.
EnergyAustralia said while assessments and community consultations are yet to be completed but, subject to approvals, the Hallett battery is expected to be operational as early as the beginning of 2026.
The project forms part of EnergyAustralia’s broader Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) announced last year, which is targeting net zero by 2050.
“Our decarbonisation plan includes the closure of the Yallourn power station and brown coal mine in mid-2028 and the transition of Mt Piper toward a lower total emissions renewables firming role and ultimately a reserve role before retirement by 2040,” EnergyAustralia Managing Director Mark Collette said at the time.
EnergyAustralia has allocated $5 billion (USD 3.3 billion) for energy storage and renewables initiatives as it seeks to accelerate the expansion of its renewable portfolio to include up to 3 GW of renewable energy, committed or operating by 2030, including direct investments and power purchase agreements.
The Hallett battery follows a string of big battery announcements from EnergyAustralia in recent times. The company has announced plans to install a 500 MW / 2,000 MWh battery energy storage system adjacent to its Mt Piper coal-fired power station in New South Wales.
It is also received approval to develop a 350 MW/ 1,400 MWh battery energy storage system alongside its Jeeralang gas-fired power station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley.

The low-voltage connected microgrid, being delivered in partnership with Queensland government-owned energy services business Yurika, will include small-scale power generation, a battery energy storage system, a back-up diesel generator, and control technologies.
Ausgrid said the microgrid, to be located at its depot in Merriwa about 270 kilometres northwest of Sydney, will be able to operate during planned and unplanned power interruptions, switching on to maintain supply automatically to homes and businesses in the trial area.
Ausgrid’s Group Executive of Customer, Assets and Digital, Junayd Hollis, said the Merriwa microgrid is the first of its kind on the company’s network and will help inform how Ausgrid can best deliver a more responsive, resilient and reliable power supply.
“This is a key innovation trial to demonstrate how Ausgrid can best support communities to be increasingly resilient in the face of extreme weather and extended outages, no matter where they live on our network,” he said.
Ausgrid, which is the largest electricity distributor on Australia’s east coast with more than 1.7 million customers, said its climate impact research for the Upper Hunter shows that by 2050 the region will be subject to an increase in all types of climate risks such as heat, storms and bushfire.
The network operator said a microgrid allows it to provide a more resilient electricity supply to customers and it is confident the technology is now at a stage that it will work reliably and cost effectively.
Hollis said the early work has commenced on the Merriwa project to ensure all 28 properties within the microgrid’s catchment area have the infrastructure required to support the connection.
The microgrid is expected to undergo commissioning in the first half of 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/23/s-5-offers-solar-attachment-solution-to-simplify-wire-management/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 23, 2024",S-5! offers solar attachment solution to simplify wire management,"United States-headquartered solar technology company S-5!, a specialist in solar attachments for metal roofs, has introduced its new MLPE Mount product.
The company describes the MLPE Mount as a universal, cost-effective method for attaching module level power electronics (MLPE) directly to solar module frames. The MLPE Mount is designed to secure optimisers and microinverters along the underside of the module frame at desired locations. According to S-5!, this simplifies wire management and electrically bonds the equipment together to comply with grounding requirements.
The MLPE Mount can be used with most solar modules as well as with all S-5!’s solar attachments, including in rail-based installations or paired with the PVKIT rail-less solar mounting solution for direct attachment to metal roofs, S-5! reports. A tab feature makes it less likely for the mount to rotate during installation, enabling one hand to position the MLPE device on the frame, while the other hand tightens the bolt to secure it.
“We were looking for a simple and cost-effective way to quickly secure optimizers and microinverters to PV frames for rail-less solar installations,” said Ricardo Barroso, director of research and development at S-5!. “With its unique teeth and tab design, S-5!’s MLPE Mount secures MLPE devices to module frames with ease without rotation; then penetrates anodization layers and embeds into the frame for superior grip, electric bonding, and grounding (earthing).”
The MLPE Mount, which is UL2703-certified, is already available in Australia with the company confirming it has just shipped a large order to electrical wholesaler and distributor TradeZone.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/23/rac-counters-driver-anxiety-with-mobile-ev-charging-service/,"EV,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",ALEISHA HEY,"JANUARY 23, 2024",RAC counters driver anxiety with mobile EV charging service,"The Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia (RAC) has deployed its first all-electric roadside assistance patrol van that will provide electric vehicle (EV) owners with emergency roadside charging in the Perth metro region.
The van, a Mercedes-Benz eVito, is equipped with a 7 kW charger that RAC said is capable of providing stranded vehicles with 15 kilometres of charge in about 20 minutes – enough for the driver to get to the nearest charging destination in the metropolitan area.
RAC General Manager External Relations Will Golsby said the dedicated service is another step toward building confidence among current and prospective EV owners.
“While we are seeing increasing interest in EVs across WA, one of the biggest concerns continues to be access to charging infrastructure,” he said.
Golsby said the trial will also help the association to understand the realities of using EVs as part of its roadside assistance fleet, allowing it to add more in the years to come.
The South Australian Royal Automobile Association (RAA) also announced this month the launch of an emergency EV charging service for stranded drivers in the Adelaide metro area.
The launch of the new service coincided with the RAA adding an electric Peugeot E-Partner to its fleet as part of a six-month trial and will inform the associations long-term transition of its patrol fleet.
The introduction of the new mobile charging services comes as EV sales in Australia continue to accelerate with data from the Australian Automobile Association (AAA) showing that EVs accounted for more than 7% of total new light vehicle sales in Australia in 2023, with more than 87,000 purchased.
The AAA EV Index published earlier this month shows sales for EVs in Australia surged in 2023, up 161.05%, or 53,807 vehicles year-on-year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/23/solar-corporate-funding-hits-decade-long-high-in-2023/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",PATRICK JOWETT,"JANUARY 23, 2024",Solar corporate funding hits decade-long high in 2023,"From pv magazine Global
Solar companies raised $51.95 billion (USD 34.3 billion) in corporate funding last year – the largest amount in a decade, according to Mercom Capital Group’s latest report on funding and merger and acquisition (M&A) activity for the sector.
The overall figure accounts for 160 deals globally and represents a 42% year-on-year increase from 2022, when $36.5 billion was made across 175 deals.
Funding from private marketing financing reached $11.21 billion last year, a 45% increase on the year prior and the second highest figure since 2013. Meanwhile, solar companies raised $30.29 billion in debt financing, a 67% increase from 2022 and the highest amount in the past decade. Mercom Capital Group said securitisation activity was a key contributor, with $5.15 billion in 11 deals.
Funding from solar venture capital activity was down 1% on 2022, reaching $10.45 billion across 69 deals in 2023. From that figure, $7.12 billion, or 68%, went to 42 solar downstream companies. Solar companies raised $2.89 billion, balance of system companies raised $473 million and service providers raised $48.7 million.
Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu said investments into solar continue to defy expectations.
“Driven by the Inflation Reduction Act, the global focus on energy security, and favourable policies worldwide, solar continues to attract significant investments,” he said.
While funding activity was strong, M&A activity declined 25% year-on-year, with 96 corporate transactions in 2023, compared to 128 in 2022. The largest transaction was by Brookfield Renewable, which acquired Duke Energy’s unregulated utility-scale commercial renewables business in the United States for approximately $4.26 billion.
“Higher borrowing costs have put a damper on M&A transactions, with cautious investors biding their time for more favourable valuations,” Prabhu said. “Solar projects continue to attract interest, but high valuations and a lower risk appetite, compounded by unpredictable project completion timelines due to interconnection delays, labour shortages, and scarcity of components, have all contributed to a drop-off in project M&A activity.”
There were 231 large-scale solar project acquisitions in 2023, down from 268 deals in 2022. In 2023, almost 45.4 GW of solar projects were acquired in 2023, compared to 66 GW in 2022, down 31% year on year.
