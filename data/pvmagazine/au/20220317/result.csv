SunDrive announced on Thursday it had recorded a solar cell efficiency of 26.07% on a full-size silicon HJT solar cell featuring the company’s technology – which replaces the expensive silver used in conventional solar PV cells with cheaper and more abundant copper – using large-scale production processes provided by Maxwell Technologies.
SunDrive, which set a new world record for commercial-sized silicon solar cell efficiency in September, said its latest result has been officially verified by Germany’s Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH)
The result is more than 0.5% higher than the 25.54% world-record achievement announced by the company last year, with SunDrive saying improvements had been observed in open-circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Isc) and fill factor (FF).
The improvement in efficiency is the result of “several equipment and processing upgrades,” the company said in an emailed statement.

SunDrive said Maxwell’s latest generation chemical vapor deposition (CVD) equipment for microcrystalline silicon layer deposition, and an innovative physical vapor deposition (PVD) coating process to create high mobility transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layers were both adopted for the batch of cells.
The metallisation of the HJT cell, with a total area of 274.3cm2 (M6 size), was performed using SunDrive’s “latest generation of direct copper plating technology which achieves finer feature sizes and superior aspect ratios compared to commercial silver screen-printing technologies”.
Silver is a key component in today’s solar panels with estimates indicating solar panel manufacturing accounts for about 20% of the world’s annual consumption of the precious metal. That volume is expected to increase as the next generation of high-efficiency cells currently being developed require up to three times more silver than their antecedents.
SunDrive’s solution, developed by co-founder and chief executive Vince Allen during his PhD at the University of New South Wales (NSW) in Sydney, has been to replace the precious metal with copper.

Allen said for solar to reach its full potential, solar cells need to be more efficient, and copper is the key to unlocking the floodgates of more efficient solar cell structures.
“Copper is around 100 times cheaper per kilogram and around 1,000 times more abundant than silver,” he said.
“And aside from the abundancy and cost benefits of copper, we have found we can improve the efficiency above and beyond what is attainable with silver.”
The company, which in December successfully fabricated its first full-size panel, said it is planning to establish cell and module production operations in Australia by the end of 2023 to provide for the nation’s rooftop solar PV market and future utility scale projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/17/australian-flow-battery-maker-eyes-largest-install-to-date-after-inking-us-deal/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND,UNITED STATES",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 17, 2022",Australian flow battery maker eyes largest install to date after inking US deal,"Queensland-based zinc-bromine flow battery maker Redflow announced on Wednesday it had signed a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) with Anaergia subsidiary SoCal Biomenthane to collaborate on the installation of a fully wrapped solar and 5.5-6.0MWh battery storage solution at its biomethane plant in California.
Under the terms of the agreement, Redflow has a first right of refusal to supply approximately 5.5–6.0 MWh of batteries to be installed at SoCal Biomenthane’s Victor Valley bioenergy plant which converts food waste and wastewater into natural gas.
Redflow said the new solar and storage project is designed to lower the plant’s energy costs over the life of the system and reduce the carbon footprint of its industrial processes.
The project, which is targeted to be completed in the first half of 2023, comes after Redflow recently completed a 2MWh battery installation at Anaergia’s Rialto Bioenergy Facility in California.
Redflow chief executive officer Tim Harris said the Rialto energy storage solution, comprising 12 of the company’s 160kWh ‘Energy Pods’, was its largest installation to date but the new project is set to overshadow it, providing renewed exposure to the considerable US market.
“Having identified the US market as a key growth market for Redflow, it is terrific to see our profile in the US continuing to build,” he said.
“We are developing a track record of executing on projects in the US, where there is a strong underlying demand for energy storage to meet carbon footprint targets, including non-lithium solutions.
“If it proceeds, at up to 6MWh, the Victor Valley Project will be our largest deployment to date, involving the supply of up to 600 Generation 3 batteries.”

Redflow said its batteries – which earlier this month were selected by US non-profit standards development organisation Underwriters Laboratories to be tested as part of a study into the key technical attributes of redox flow batteries – are designed for high cycle-rate, long time-base stationary energy storage applications, and are scalable from small systems through to grid-scale deployments.
Harris said the company’s batteries offer unique advantages including secure remote management, 100% daily depth of discharge, tolerance of high ambient temperatures, and sustained energy delivery throughout their operating life.
“Our deployment for Anaergia’s Rialto bioenergy facility demonstrated that our zinc-flow battery energy storage solutions were ideal for meeting the needs of US commercial and industrial customers as our batteries can thrive under tough conditions for extended durations,” he said.
“Redflow is uniquely placed to be at the forefront of energy storage as large commercial and industrial companies look to execute on their renewable energy strategies.”
Harris said under the terms of  the LOI, Redflow will assist in the selection of a project constructor by providing technical support on integrating its zinc-bromine flow battery technology into the solar and storage solution and refining the project scope to meet SoCal Biomenthane’s requirements.

Concentrating solar power plus thermal energy storage (CSP+TES) could be cost-competitive with battery storage for achieving a least-cost 100% renewables grid in the continental US, researchers have found.
For seasonal storage, power-to-gas-to-power had lower costs than CSP+TES.
Researchers used a simple model of the grid that assumed free lossless transmission across the continental US. They said their results could guide future studies using more detailed models, and expected that a model realistically representing transmission would not fundamentally alter the relative roles of the generation and storage technologies they evaluated. The study was published in the journal Advances in Applied Energy.
With CSP, mirrors direct sunlight onto receivers containing a heat transfer fluid, and the heat is used to run a steam turbine. Adding thermal energy storage allows electricity to be generated later.
CSP alone costs more than solar PV, and when researchers ran the model without TES, it selected no CSP. But TES costs less than battery storage, and when TES is added to CSP, the technology combination becomes competitive with batteries, the study found. The system cost savings of adding CSP+TES to a system with batteries was slight, at only 0.07 cents/kWh.
For increased uptake of the combined technology, cost reductions for CSP would be more important than cost reductions for TES. Yet ongoing cost reductions for batteries, as projected by NREL, would counter increased uptake of CSP+TES.
With power-to-gas-to-power (PGP) technology, renewable power is used to generate hydrogen from water, using electrolysers. The hydrogen is later used to generate electricity using fuel cells, in the approach modelled by the researchers.
Seasonal storage needs in a 100% renewables grid were met with PGP storage capacity reaching 89,000GWh, the model showed. Short term-storage, typically with daily cycling, was met with far less capacity: 620GWh of thermal energy storage capacity, supplying 0.6% of total electricity supply, and 350GWh of battery storage capacity.
Demand response was represented in the model by allowing the system to supply less than the historical use profile “by paying a high cost.” Efforts to increase demand flexibility “could minimise the value” of CSP+TES, the authors said.
When methane gas units at varying percentages of generation were permitted, in a sensitivity analysis, the model selected batteries when methane gas generation was reduced to 5%, selected PGP with methane gas at or below 2%, and selected CSP+TES with methane gas at or below 0.1%.
The open-access article presents all cost elements for the generation and storage technologies considered, and is titled “The role of concentrated solar power with thermal energy storage in least-cost highly reliable electricity systems fully powered by variable renewable energy.”

Established by the Department of Energy (DOE) Solar Energy Technology Office (SETO), the Durable Module Materials consortium (DuraMAT) has been working since its inception in 2016 to improve PV materials use.
DuraMAT has awarded $30 million to high-impact projects, and in 2021 was given an additional $36 million by SETO for six more years of funding. The funds will help the consortium continue to develop solar module materials science in pursuit of a 50-year life for PV.
“We are trying to shift into a reliability research mode where we’re directly targeting modules that last 50 years,” said Teresa Barnes, DuraMAT director. “We’re very focused on high-energy-yield modules and making those in a sustainable way. We know there are going to be big material and energy impacts from ramping up deployment as fast as we need for the energy transition. But our question is, ‘How can we do that in a way that’s environmentally sustainable and in a way that our supply chain can keep up?’”
Five Core Objectives
The consortium has five core objectives. First, it seeks to act as a central data resource, collecting and disseminating solar module reliability data, and applying the data to create insights. The DuraMAT database is a centralised source with the ability to ingest, curate, combine, analyse, and manage diverse datasets.
Second, DuraMAT provides fielded module forensics, quantifying and characterising module failures in outdoor exposures and recording environmental effects. It said one of the biggest hurdles to studying degradation or failure in fielded modules is that frequent absence of a “reference” or control module. This core objective is designed to provide better understanding of PV material durability, and to generate practical, multi-modal data that guides next steps in materials and module design.
As a third objective, the team develops a multi-scale, multi-physics model to accelerate testing and quantitatively assess material degradation. “We are now shifting our emphasis towards predictive testing and modelling methods that will enable us to assess reliability more quickly and more accurately in new technologies,” said Barnes.
Fourth, it provides module materials solutions, in which the consortium designs, develops, de-risks innovative materials and module architectures to address PV reliability issues. The group has worked to characterise failure modes, develop crack tolerant metallisation, and design recyclable backsheets. It has also developed technical requirements and materials guidelines that have enabled thin-film module development.
And as a final core objective, the consortium uses disruptive acceleration science to test materials. Using aggressive conditions like pressing modules with rings to simulate bending, or with sound waves to mimic the warping effect of wind, the consortium stress-tests modules to see how they would perform in the toughest conditions and over long stretches of time.
(Watch: “Solar panels blasted with sound to better understand microcracking”) 
“If solar is going to expand and become this ubiquitous technology that we have across our power system, on our houses—and be responsible for 40% of our electricity generation—old technologies are not enough,” said Barnes. “PV modules need to be made more efficient, less expensive, and more sustainably at much larger scale. But we also need to know that these new modules—whether they’re new module designs or new cell technologies like bifacial or tandem cells—will perform predictably in the field.”
