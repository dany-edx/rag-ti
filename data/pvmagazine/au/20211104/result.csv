The conclusions reached by the paper, Estimations of future changes in photovoltaic potential in Australia due to climate change provide insights into where solar farms could best be located as this century progresses; what solar researchers and manufacturers should be selecting for — performance at higher temperatures — in future cell technologies; and together with a companion paper on wind resource under climate change, published in 2018, they have implications for the siting of hybrid solar and wind generation that is expected to fuel Australia’s touted future hydrogen economy.
Since solar PV has become a vital pillar of the world’s transition to renewable energy, it’s essential that researchers are provided license to look up and beyond the immediate and very pressing horizon, to ensure PV development is following a reliable, sustainable, investable path.
This is the first study to use high-resolution regional climate projections in Australia to forecast changes in PV potential due to variations in shortwave downwelling radiation, temperature and wind speed; and the first ever to consider the additional impact of changes in cell temperatures.
Shukla Poddar, PhD student at the UNSW School of Photovoltaic Energy and Engineering (SPREE) and lead author on the paper told pv magazine Australia that the most surprising outcome of this research “is the cell temperature effect”. 
In other words, it’s obvious that changes in irradiation might cause increases or decreases in solar PV output in the decades-distant future, but in fact ever-increasing ambient temperatures implicit in global warming will also reduce cell efficiency and likely accelerate degradation of solar cells so that their output over time will further decrease, as will their risk of failure.
As UNSW Scientia Professor Martin Green has famously said, “Solar cells would prefer to be operating in a fridge”. Instead, their operating environment is typically hot, and becoming relentlessly hotter.
Poddar and co-authors have measured the effect on polysilicon solar cells of temperature rises under a high emissions scenario that projects warming of 3.4 degrees Celsius by 2100.
It’s not that the researchers are pessimists — far from it. But high-resolution climate simulations available from the New South Wales/Australian Capital Territory Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) project used the high-emissions A2 scenario, and the previous study into wind resource by one of Poddar’s co-authors, Jason Evans had also used the NARCliM data. Using the same data, ensures the two studies are relatable, to give an overall picture of how Australia’s renewable resources will fare under climate change.
A third co-author, Dr Merlinde Kay, tells pv magazine Australia, “When you’re thinking about this work, it serves as a risk management strategy.
“It describes what could happen in the future and gives people enough time to prepare for what the most extreme outcome could be.”
UNSW SPREE
The paper found that PV potential across Australia is projected to decline during the 21st century: during both a near-future period, defined by NARCliM as 2020-2039 (which has already begun), and the NARCliM-defined far-future period of 2040-2079.
However, some geographies will experience more pronounced changes due to evolving weather patterns under climate change:  “The maximum decline in PV power generation is expected to occur in Northern Australia during the near-future period and South-East Australia during the far future period,” say the authors, with the greatest decreases due to elevated temperatures, and the next most significant effect due to a projected decline in radiation.
There will be more days each year when PV power generation is significantly less than the rated generation capacity.
UNSW SPREE
These findings make Professor Martin Green’s research into technologies that will lower the operating temperature of solar cells even more urgent.
Green’s recent desktop study into the effectiveness of cooling cells by various methods was carried out in collaboration with 5B, the suppliers of prefabricated, “foldout” arrays of solar panels to the world’s biggest solar PV and battery storage project known as Sun Cable. Some components of the project are scheduled to commence construction in the Northern Territory’s Barkly region in late 2023, and it is expected to achieve full capacity — between 17 GW and 20 GW of solar generation, and 36-42 GWh of storage — in late 2028. That is, the project will be operating within the near-future period defined by the UNSW study.
“For a researcher, it would be an amazing case study to measure what occurs there,” says Kay.
5B itself closely monitors its innovative ground-mounted Maverick  system, verifying performance under different conditions. It has a reciprocal research arrangement with UNSW, sharing data with UNSW and is now participating in experimental research to lower field operating temperatures of solar cells, which will help mitigate the effects of climate change.
UNSW SPREE
Like recent groundbreaking UNSW research into the sustainability of silver, indium and bismuth use in the solar industry as it moves toward multi-terrawatt production and installation, the Estimation of future changes in PV potential… paper could also serve to narrow the field for future viable PV technologies — specifically those that deliver efficiency at high temperatures.
Poddar says that cadmium telluride and other thin-film technologies look promising.
Such cell structures are already being deployed by some solar manufacturers: for example, US solar module manufacturer, First Solar, this year announced that its Series 6 CuRe panels have achieved what it claims to be the lowest degradation rate in the PV industry, and can operate at high efficiency, even when cell temperatures reach 85 degrees Celsius.
Overall, this latest future-focused UNSW research hopes to “help in the assessment of resources and site allocation before deployment of large-scale projects in Australia”, says the paper.
And, it concludes, “It is highly recommended to incorporate a detailed intercomparison of various PV technologies in future for the areas expecting a high temperature rise due to global warming” — appropriate PV material selection will ensure maximum power generation in future heated climate scenarios.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/04/photon-plans-worlds-largest-solarstorage-project-in-south-australia/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NETHERLANDS,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,WESTERN EUROPE",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 4, 2021",Photon plans world’s largest solar+storage project in South Australia,"Photon Energy is proposing to build a large-scale renewable energy facility in South Australia that will showcase Melbourne-based RayGen Resources’ innovative ‘solar-hydro’ technology which merges solar power generation with long-duration energy storage.
The power plant is set to be built in South Australia with the Amsterdam-headquartered Photon Energy saying it has already secured 1,200 hectares of land for the project. The company did not however reveal the specific location.
Photon said the project will have a total solar generation capacity of 300 MW with a grid connection capacity of 150 MW. The target energy storage capacity is 3.6 GWh, equivalent to 24 hours of full load, to the grid, from storage. If the target is achieved, it will exceed the 3 GWh capacity of the Ouarzazate Solar Power Station in Morocco, which currently has the world’s largest energy storage capacity of any type, excluding pumped hydro.
“We are very excited to be developing this innovative and globally significant solar energy storage project in South Australia,” said Michael Gartner, Photon Energy chief technical officer and managing director of its Australian operations
“The enviable solar resource and need for energy storage due to high penetration of renewables in this region is a perfect match for RayGen’s technology.”
Photon said it is working on the permitting and grid-connection processes and expects to complete the preparatory work by the end of 2023.

The project will utilise RayGen’s concentrated solar PV Ultra technology with electro-thermal storage comprising water-based pit thermal energy storage, Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) turbines and industrial chillers.
RayGen’s technology co-generates renewable energy and large-scale storage by focusing sunlight with a field of aligned mirrors, or heliostats, onto a tower-mounted receiver containing an array of PV Ultra modules made of gallium arsenide PV cells, creating the ability to co-generate electricity and heat.
The heat generated by the concentrated PV technology generates heat is captured and used to boost the efficiency of the thermal storage element. The electro-thermal storage system consists of an ORC turbine, industrial chillers and two insulated water-based thermal storage pits or reservoirs. One of the reservoirs is kept at a temperature of 90 degrees and the other at close to 0 degrees, and the temperature difference is used to generate dispatchable electricity using ORC turbines.
RayGen has been operating the technology for more than six years in a 1 MW pilot project at Newbridge, Victoria and is currently building 4 MW of solar PV generation and 3 MW / 50 MWh (equivalent to 17 hours) of dispatchable storage capacity at Carwarp in the state’s northwest.

The Carwarp facility is due for completion in mid-2022 and RayGen expects it will be able to satisfy the Low Emissions Technology Statement stretch goal of providing firmed renewables for under $100 / MWh.
RayGen chief executive Richard Payne has previously said the great potential of the technology is in its scalability with the PV Ultra technology able to generate the same amount of electricity as a normal solar facility with only a quarter of the land.
“Australia’s energy transition will require storage solutions that can store power cost-effectively for hours, days or weeks and be deployed at large scale around the world,” he said.
“RayGen has developed an innovative solar-plus-storage product that captures sunlight with mirrors and stores energy in water. Our technology provides firm renewable power at low cost, while conserving natural resources and our environment.”
Photon said the South Australian project is one of “multiple sites” it is currently developing in Australia which are suitable for RayGen’s solar technology in combination with its energy storage solution.
The announcement comes after RayGen recently closed its Series C capital raise for $55 million where Photon participated alongside AGL Energy, Schlumberger New Energy, Chevron Technology Ventures and Equinor Ventures. As well as the private funding, the investment round also included $15 million of grant funding from the national Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/04/international-heavy-hitters-line-up-for-green-hydrogen-hub/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 4, 2021",International ‘heavy-hitters’ line up for green hydrogen hub,"The South Australian government said it has shortlisted seven renewable hydrogen projects that combined could produce more than 1.5 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year as it looks to develop the proposed Port Bonython Hydrogen Hub into a world-leading production and export facility.
Premier Steven Marshall said the level of investment interest in the Port Bonython Hydrogen Hub would make the Spencer Gulf a world-class renewable energy precinct and has the capacity to transform South Australia into a renewable energy exporter of world standing within the next decade.
“Seven shortlisted projects from both Australian and international heavy-hitters are proposing tens of billions of dollars of investment, potentially creating hundreds of local jobs, in all parts of the hydrogen supply chain,” he said.
“Together, the seven shortlisted projects could produce over one and a half million tonnes of hydrogen per annum, which would make South Australia one of the most significant producers of hydrogen in the world.”
The government said it is now negotiating with shortlisted parties, aiming to finalise arrangements with partners to be announced in coming months.
The Port Bonython Hydrogen Hub, identified as a potential export hub for green hydrogen in South Australia’s Hydrogen Export Prospectus, assumes 2.3-6.5 GW renewable energy development to feed electrolysers of 1.2-2.5 GW.
Energy Minister Dan Van Holst Pellekaan said the response to the Expression of Interest (EOI) would help deliver the state government’s ambition to produce 500% of current grid demand in renewable energy by 2050.
It is expected that ambition, outlined in the Climate Change Action Plan released late last year, will be in part delivered by exporting power interstate through the new high-voltage electricity transmission interconnector between South Australia and New South Wales and internationally through clean exports like hydrogen.

“The response from industry to the Port Bonython EOI shows that we can turn our 500% renewable energy by 2050 vision into a reality,” Van Holst Pellekaan said.
“The SA-NSW Interconnector means we can export renewable energy interstate – the Port Bonython Hydrogen Hub will allow us to export it internationally.”
Whyalla Mayor Clare McLaughlin welcomed the announcement, declaring the Port Bonython region ideally suited to serve as a green hydrogen production and export hub.
The state-owned site at Port Bonython has access to multiple renewable energy zones and more than 2,000 hectares of available land, as well as access to an existing deep-water port, including a 2.4-kilometre-long jetty which has been approved for a $37 million state government-funded upgrade.
“We have an abundance of land and solar energy projects in the pipeline to power the conversion of water to hydrogen; we have the road, rail and port facilities to support distribution and export of hydrogen; we have key local industry preparing for conversion to hydrogen … we’re well-placed on all fronts,” McLaughlin said.
“The fact the state government has now shortlisted a group of national and international companies to work with means we are another step closer to realising our hydrogen potential.
“We’re therefore keen to work closely with all levels of government, and the private sector, to deliver these significant developments as soon as possible.”
The Port Bonython site is already home to oil and gas producer Santos’ processing plant, which receives natural gas liquids and crude oil piped 659km from the Moomba plant for export, and a diesel fuel import and storage terminal.

The region is also home to a string of renewable energy projects including the proposed 280 MW Cultana Solar Farm, the first project in industrialist Sanjeev Gupta’s plan to generate 1 GW of dispatchable renewable energy in the state.
Amp Power Australia, the Australian operating arm of Canadian clean energy developer Amp Energy, has also set its sights on the region, recently signing a lease agreement to develop its 388 MW Yoorndoo Ilga solar farm and hybridised 150 MW battery north of Whyalla.
The Yoorndoo Ilga Solar farm is one of three sites comprising Amp’s 1.3 GW Renewable Energy Hub of South Australia, which will also include solar farms coupled with storage in Robertstown (636 MW) and Bungama (336 MW). Amp has set out an investment in excess of $2 billion for the hub’s creation, which is planned to also generate hydrogen for both the domestic and export markets in future.
Australian company H2U has also announced plans to develop a $240 million hydrogen project near Whyalla.
The company said its Eyre Peninsula Gateway Hydrogen Project will see the installation of a 75 MW electrolyser capable of producing enough green hydrogen to create 40,000 tonnes of ammonia each year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/04/contract-power-signs-on-to-deliver-solar-solution-for-wa-miner/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 4, 2021",Contract Power signs on to deliver solar solution for WA miner,"Pacific Energy Group subsidiary Contract Power Australia has been awarded a 15-year Build, Own Operate (BOO) contract to construct a 6 MW solar PV farm at Pilbara Minerals’ Pilgangoora lithium-tantalum mining operation in remote Western Australia (WA), about 120 kilometres southwest of Port Hedland.
Contract Power will work alongside fellow Pacific Energy subsidiary Hybrid Systems Australia to build the solar farm which will be designed to allow for future expansion of solar capacity.
The design will also provide an option to include battery energy storage as Pilbara Minerals looks to create further efficiencies around its power supply and storage solutions.
Home to one of the biggest new lithium ore deposits in the world, the Pilgangoora operation is currently powered by a diesel-fired power plant which was installed by WA-based Contract Power in 2018 and currently covers 28 MW of baseload power supply.
Pilbara Minerals, which retains the option to purchase the solar farm outright in the future, estimates the renewable energy generation will replace 3.8 million litres of annual diesel fuel usage and reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 9,900 tonnes over the life of the agreement.
Pilbara Minerals said the solar farm is an “important demonstration of the company’s commitment to implementing environmentally friendly power solutions” and would help its transition to net-zero emissions.
“Pilbara Minerals looks forward to continuing our working relationship with Contract Power and the broader Pacific Energy Group, which began in 2018 when the first baseload power station was installed at Pilgangoora,” the company said in a statement.
Work on the solar farm is expected to commence in the coming months with commissioning expected late July 2022 ahead of commercial operations commencing in August 2022.
Pilbara Minerals said the installation of the first phase of the solar farm is just one part of the initial rationalisation of power assets at Pilgangoora.

The company has indicated a local power network will be created to join the Ngungaju and Pilgan plants, and the mining operation’s camp facilities to create further efficiencies.
Pilbara Minerals said the project is part of its longer-term objectives which include integration with other renewable power sources in the region with a view to creating further efficiency gains on the path to net zero carbon.
The Pilbara region is fast becoming a hot spot for renewable energy with Contract Power earlier this year signed to design, construct, install and commission two batteries totalling 42 MW for Fortescue Metals Group as part of its Pilbara Energy Connect project.
The hybrid generation project, which will combine 150 MW of gas-fired generation with 150 MW of solar PV and the grid-scale battery, will provide power to the Iron Bridge magnetite project currently under construction.
Fellow mining giant Rio Tinto is also pursuing renewables in the region, recently approving a $98 million solar+battery energy storage system at its Koodaideri mine.
The project will include a 34 MW solar PV plant accompanied by a 12 MWh lithium-ion battery energy storage system. The 34 MW solar PV plant is set to supply approximately 65% of the iron ore operation’s power demands.
Also planned for the region is the massive $50 billion Asian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH), a hybrid solar and wind plant set to be developed near Port Hedland.
The facility, which is expected to eventually reach 26 GW, would be used to power 14 GW of electrolysers to convert desalinated seawater into green hydrogen with most of the hydrogen converted to green ammonia for export.

“I’m delighted that Brett will be joining Transgrid as we continue to lead the transition to Australia’s clean energy future,” Transgrid chair Jerry Maycock said.
“Brett’s experience in managing complex change and transition issues in the energy industry and his commitment to the development of renewable and sustainable energy projects make him an excellent candidate to lead Transgrid in the new era of transformation of the energy system.
“His commercial acumen and focus on innovation will also be invaluable as we grow Transgrid’s energy services and telecommunications business, Lumea who continue to invest in new technologies including grid scale batteries, energy management systems, and the electrification of transport.”
Redman, who will take up the role on 16 November, served for more than two years as managing director and CEO of AGL Energy, the nation’s largest energy generator and a leading energy retailer of energy with more than 4.5 million customers.
That tenure came to an abrupt end in April when Redman announced he would quit the role just weeks after the energy giant announced it would split its business into two entities with separate strategies.
Prior to being appointed CEO of AGL in December 2018, Redman spent 11 years in senior leadership roles across AGL, including chief financial officer. During this time, he led major transformational investment opportunities, including the creation of the Powering Australian Renewables Fund (PowAR) to kick-start large-scale wind and solar development opportunities.
Redman said Transgrid will play a pivotal role in Australia’s decarbonisation journey as the transition away from coal gathers pace.
“Transgrid is investing in world-leading technology as it builds a modern grid for Australia,” he said.
“I’m looking forward to working with the team and with local communities to deliver the projects and the innovations that will accelerate Australia’s transition to a cleaner energy future.”
Rick Francis, managing director of electricity network owner Spark Infrastructure which owns a 15% stake in Transgrid, welcomed the appointment.
“His extensive experience in the energy sector and commercial acumen makes him the ideal executive to assist TransGrid in continuing to lead the transition to Australia’s clean energy future,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/04/module-price-hike-impacting-middle-sized-pv-projects-in-south-korea/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 4, 2021",Module price hike impacting middle-sized PV projects in South Korea,"From pv magazine Global
The current global supply chain disruption in the PV industry is delaying or making unviable many solar projects across all markets. According to a recent report from Norwegian business intelligence firm Rystad Energy, increasing module and shipping costs may cause the delay or cancellation of as much as 56% of the solar generation capacity currently planned worldwide next year.
South Korea seems to be no exception, although it can count on a strong domestic solar panel industry that has recently increased its effort to enhance production capacities.
“Currently, there is no official index for solar panel prices in Korea,” Kyungrak Kwon, renewables program director at Seoul-based NGO Solutions for Our Climate, told pv magazine. “However, according to industry interviews, it is understood that the panel price has increased from 10% to 15%, or from KRW340 to KRW400 per Watt ($0.289-0.339), over the past six months.”
According to him, this price hike may affect, in particular, small and medium-sized solar energy projects that have participated in the country’s renewable energy certificate (REC) scheme within the last six months. “If a developer participates in the solar power bidding market organised by the Korea Energy Agency, the installation must be completed within six months,” he further explained. “If the module price increases within that period, losses will occur due to the confirmed bid price.”
In the latest tender held under the scheme by the agency, 2 GW of PV was allocated at a final average price of KRW136.128 per kWh ($0.115). “It is difficult to know the exact number of projects halted by the supply chain disruptions in Korea,” Kwon added. “However, currently, about 1-1.2 GW of solar power in Korea is supplied every quarter, and 80% of these projects are small and medium-sized, with less than 1 MW [generation capacity], so these projects are expected to be most affected.”
He also explained that Korean manufacturers are currently predicting that supply chain disruption will continue at least until the second quarter of next year. According to him, module prices may not decrease within two years, if China’s current issues with lack of power and raw material supply will not be resolved.
When asked if the Korean industry may be capable of responding to the supply bottlenecks by increasing capacity, Kwon said that the largest Korean manufacturer, Hanwha Solutions, announced in a recent conference call that, considering the reduction in production in the second half of the year, the internal target for module sales was lowered from 9 to 8 GW, although it has a total production capacity of 10 GW. “This can be understood as reflecting the recent increase in raw material prices,” Kwon emphasised. “Two months ago, Hanwha Solutions announced that it plans to expand production capacity of n-type solar modules by investing KRW1 trillion ($849 million) in Jinchoen plants by 2025, but I understand that this is not a strategy to respond to the recent supply bottleneck.”
South Korea reached an installed solar power capacity of around 15.6 GW as of the end of December 2020. The newly installed PV capacity for 2020 was around 4.1 GW.
The country currently plans to install 30.8 GW of solar by 2030.
