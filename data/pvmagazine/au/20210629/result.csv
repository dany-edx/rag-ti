The Carseldine Village includes 194 sustainable living freehold terrace homes featuring solar PV and AlphaESS battery storage systems, designed to EnviroDevelopment’s Six-Leaf standard.
Today, Everygen announced its involvement in the project, which will be to provide the platform to operate a two-year home energy management system pilot at the Village. Through Evergen’s energy control software, the pilot will coordinate the home’s rooftop solar, battery and air conditioning units based on the homeowner preferences and the needs of the network.
25 homeowners will be part of the pilot scheme, the objective of which is to learn how home energy use can be modified throughout the day to provide the best value to the homeowner and to avoid congestion on the grid.
The household’s default mode will be self-consumption of solar power. If the house has a lower load than is being generated, then it will fill the battery. If the battery is full, then it will export to the grid. Ideally, network operators want to optimise when that waterfall effect happens because all of the houses do it simultaneously.
“The aim is to evolve the home energy system to make smarter use of the energy, which is the next step in the long-term development of a domestic solar and storage capability that complements the grid,” Evergen CEO, Ben Hutt, said. “This will become more and more important as homeowners are compensated in ever-smaller amounts (or even penalised) for putting their excess energy into the grid.”

The system will learn the homeowner’s usage patterns and make decisions that work with that lifestyle, such as when the owner most usually returns home or runs peak load at their property.
It also allows the system to make decisions to ensure stored power is used to negate peak demands on the grid, such as switching between air conditioning units within a property or by switching off an air conditioning unit for five minutes each hour.
Evergen says while such behaviour only makes a slight difference to an individual user, it allows the entire neighbourhood to manage switching between properties to ensure the development can avoid instances such as network blackouts during heatwaves.
Evergen’s participation in the Carseldine Village project follows on from its work on Mirvac’s ‘House with No Bills’ study in 2018.  Across 12 months, the House with No Bills used only 8% more electricity than it generated and operated as ‘energy positive’ for five months, affording the real possibility of the home having zero energy bills in the future.

Well, you aren’t the first to imagine such a future. Solar windows have fascinated scientists, engineers, for almost half a century, their siren song occupying researchers from California to Denmark.
The trick of solar windows is that they need to absorb non-visible light rays, like the UV spectrum, but leave the visible spectrum untouched. They then need to convert that non-visible light into a longer wavelength, trap it inside the window and guide it to the edge where a solar panel is ready and waiting, embedded in the window’s frame.
Daniel Carson | dcimages.org
Creating a solar window without any optical distortions or colour is one thing, the real sticking point is creating one which is actually scalable and able to be mass produced using normal industry manufacturing processes.
“Those are the difficulties but we’ve overcome them already,” ClearVue Technologies’ Executive Chairman, Victor Rosenberg, told pv magazine Australia. ClearVue today has an industry-standard 3.5 x 1.6 metre solar window which can harvest light with 3.3% efficiency, delivering a minimum of 30 watts per square metre while maintaining 70% transparency.
ClearVue is hoping to boost that efficiency up to 5% over the next 18 months though with the help of a group of researchers at the ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science. Three of the centre’s researchers are currently developing nanoparticles which are able to transfer non-visible light rays in ways the softly-spoken scientists described to pv magazine Australia as something of a “breakthrough.”
ClearVue is far from the only company in the world developing solar windows, but Rosenberg believes they are the only ones with a completely clear and industry-sized window on the market today. Developed so they can be easily incorporated by architects and designers, Rosenberg says the ambition is to integrate solar windows into the construction industry where they could be used in office blocks, sky scrapers, bus shelters, airports, greenhouses and more.  “Where ever you see glass,” Rosenberg said.
Just yesterday, the company announced its glass will soon feature in an inner city Sydney park where it will cover an outdoor seating area, capturing UV rays (therefore protecting park-goers from the harmful end of the sun spectrum) and using it to power the site’s lighting.

Given that the creation of solar windows involves making optimal luminescent solar concentrators, embedding them in lamination, speciality glass, a well as applying speciality processing materials and window coating, they’re a rather a monumental feat of multidisciplinary engineering.
Which is where Exciton Science’s ARC Centre of Excellence comes in. Funded by the Australian Research Council, the centre is a collaboration of leading light energy researchers from the University of Melbourne, Monash University, RMIT, University of NSW and the University of Sydney with a particular focus on industry partnership.
ClearVue is one of those partners, enlisting the expertise of the centre to bring its vision to new levels of clarity, literally. “Our contribution will essentially be ‘souping up’ the window they are already developing,” researcher Dr Nick Kirkwood told pv magazine Australia.

As is always the way with science, a little scratch of the surface tumbles you into an inexplicably whacky world. In this case, its one of nanoparticles or, as Rosenberg calls them, ‘quantum dots’.
They’ve really been solar window’s missing step, preventing the vision of a clear solar window becoming a cold, hard reality. “Making very high quality nanoparticles is a relatively recent development, having the control over these synthetic methods to make them well,” Dr Kirkwood said.
The nanoparticles’ job is to absorb the light of the sun and then reemit it inside the window at a different wavelength. The first part of that job, the absorption, is called the quantum yield. It refers to the percentage of photons the nanoparticles emit relative to how much they absorb – the higher the number, the more is emitted.
Alice Chen is heading up Exiton’s nanoparticle research for ClearVue, building on the work of her colleague Tim Warner. She has managed to get her nanoparticles to reach a quantum yield of 80%, though that number tends to drop down to around 60% when scaled. “These are really chemical reactions. We cook up these nanoparticles in beakers in our lab and so we can vary the temperatures and the times and what we add in – and then scaling that up is an art form,” Dr Kirkwood explained.
The second job of the nanoparticles is to reemit the sucked-in light at a different wave length, known as a stokes shift. Again, the bigger the stokes shift, the better. You don’t want one nanoparticle to spit out light only for its neighbouring nanoparticle to suck it right back up. Rather, you want all the other nanoparticles to ignore it, letting it refract along unimpeded to the side of the window. Here Chen has had another win, achieving a “breakthrough” gap between the absorbed and emitted lightwaves.

The sun’s reemitted light is then “wave guided” to the edges of the window. How this part works is really in the same principle as an optical fibre. “It’s to do with the angle of the light,” Dr Kirkwood said. As long as the angles are quite flat, it will keep bouncing.
But, of course, there’s a snag. The angle at which light is reemitted is always random, so there’s a chance it will just go straight back out the way it came. Generally you lose about 25% of the light which hits a window out of the faces. “This is one of the challenges we have to work with,” Dr Kirkwood said.
While no one has yet figured out a way to engineer chaos out of the universe, researcher Tim Warner has been looking into the effects of changing the nanoparticles’ shape and how this effects the angle light reemits. If you use a nano particle that’s shaped like a rod rather than a sphere, you have more control over which way the light is going to go, Warner explained.
This little kernel of knowledge hasn’t been integrated into the work the centre’s been doing with ClearVue yet because they haven’t managed to get their rod-shaped nanoparticles transparent, but it’s certainly possible, bringing paths to higher efficiency well into view. “It’s just this process of communication and iterative improvements until it works,” Dr Kirkwood said.
Why nanoparticles are a perfect fit for solar windows is twofold: firstly, they are nano sized, “so they actually don’t scatter light, they would make the window look completely clear. Whereas if you were to put larger particles like micron or millimetre sized particles in a window, it would have a milky look,” Dr Kirkwood said.
The second benefit is nanoparticles are inorganic – meaning they are made from metals (like metal oxides or metal sulphides) and various elements of the period table which remain stable under intensive light and high temperatures. “So they are able to withstand the manufacturing process and the window itself sitting in the sun, and also deliver on this optical promise that ClearVue have.”
“I think that’s why it’s really only been in the last five to ten years that people have realised you can actually make a highly efficient transparent or tinted window with this kind of technology,” Dr Kirkwood added. In other words, it’s a relatively recent development that this long-held solar window dream is technologically viable.
The other side to this coin is economic viability. As fate would have it, the collapse of PV cell pricing has coincided nicely.

Which brings us to the where theoretical viability meets reality: manufacturing. Of the three researchers, Warner’s job is to take the materials made in the lab and put them into polymer films which will ultimately go into the window. These processes are hot (160°C is the industry standard), messy and intensive. “So we want to make sure that when we put particles into this process that they’re not just going to die,” Warner explained.
To this end, the Exiton Science crew recently teamed up with Martogg & Company to mix its nanoparticles in to polymer pellets, ready to be formed into films – a vital step for ensuring their science works not just in the clean university lab but also in the more brutal realm of industry. Beakers and Bunsen burners can only go so far…
Research–industry partnership lays at the heart of Exiton’s work, with Dr Kirkwood poking fun at the fact scientists haven’t always been the best at judging what’s useful and what’s not.
“You think you’re doing something correct, and actually you’re going off on a tangent,” he said.
ClearVue’s Executive Chairman, Rosenberg, agrees. “The days of research for the sake of research are over,” he told pv magazine Australia. “It’s got to be research that has a commercial outcome.”
ClearVue isn’t new to the world of research partnerships. The company’s lead scientist Mikhail Vasiliev came to the company after years of research projects at education institutions before becoming directly employed by ClearVue.

ClearVue has had solar windows in production since 2017, though Rosenberg says the final touches of refinement have happened these last two years.
“It’s one thing trying to create the raw material that will give you the effect, you’ve then got to be able to manufacture the end product on a scaleable process, and that’s a real milestone. We’ve done that now,” he said.
ClearVue’s vision is to become an intrinsic part of smart city future design, with Rosenberg also noting the solar windows are highly insulative and can help building reduce power consumption. He believes there’s about 350 billion square metres of buildings in existence today, and that figure will double over the next 40 years. So when I asked him about the size of the solar window market, he chuckled. “It’s too big,” he said. “The new market is billion of square metres, the replacement market is billions of  square metres.”
Currently ClearVue’s windows cost around US$300 – $400 (AU$400 – $530) per square metre and are being manufactured in China. Rosenberg expects that price to come down significantly as orders increase. Which they have been.
Just yesterday ClearVue announced the AU$114,000 order for the Sydney park. In April, the company opened the world’s first solar greenhouse at Western Australia’s Murdoch university, which featured three different versions of its transparent solar photovoltaic glazing panels.
Rosenberg says the company is already supplying its 3.3% efficiency windows to Japan, China, Korea, and the United States.
The company also recently signed a distribution agreement with Japanese company Tomita Technologies which will see its building integrated PV glazing products sold in Japan. And in May, ClearVue entered into an agreement with Dutch company eLstar which develops and industrialises smart glass applications in the building and transport industries.
“We are looking at incorporating the most cutting edge and the most advanced of luminescent materials,” ClearVue lead scientist Mikhail Vasiliev told pv magazine Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/29/why-most-aussies-wont-be-owning-electric-cars-in-the-next-five-years/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JUNE 29, 2021",Why most Aussies won’t be owning electric cars in the next five years,"Several countries have also created their own targets to eliminate petrol-powered cars, encouraging more people to switch to electric. Amongst this global push for EV adoption, Australian governments are going in the opposite direction, proposing a tax on EV owners. This is despite the fact that EVs made up less than 1% (0.75%) of the total car sales volume across Australia last year. When there was an outcry to tax the 1%, I don’t imagine this is quite what they had in mind.
The Victorian government’s proposed EV tax has been branded the “worst electric vehicle policy in the world” in an open letter from 25 leading industry stakeholders including car manufacturers, infrastructure companies and environmental organisations. It has also been heavily criticised by the Electric Vehicle Council as the only policy in the world actively ‘de-incentivising’ the purchase of electric vehicles. 
Alongside this, new research has shown that the idea of car ownership is rapidly changing around the country, making the tax debate near obsolete in the longer term. According to a survey of 1000 Australians conducted by Pureprofile and commissioned by Loopit, there is a strong link between EVs and car subscription, with the majority (77%) of future EV adopters preferring to subscribe to one rather than buy it. A ‘car subscription’ allows drivers to get behind the wheel of a new car through weekly payments and without  a lock-in contract, similar to a phone plan. The car can be upgraded to a newer model every few months, swapped to a different model that better suits their needs or returned if no longer needed.
Most Australian drivers (90%) say car subscriptions will make electric cars more accessible by providing another ownership option, while 76% believe car subscription will make EVs more popular by removing the long-term commitment of buying one outright. According to 80% of the survey’s respondents, car subscription will help the uptake of EVs in Australia.
As these subscription services continue to be rolled out in dealerships across Australia, the trend away from traditional car ownership will continue – especially for EV adopters who tend to be more open to new innovations in the market. As ‘early adopters’ of technology, EV owners expect innovation from the ownership experience as much as the vehicle itself. Similar to those who upgrade to the latest iPhone every year, these drivers will be looking to upgrade to the latest model EV more frequently, and subscription allows for this.
The Australian government, on the other hand, has maintained a consistent track record for stifling new car technology in Australia. The Luxury Car Tax – intended to protect the now defunct local car manufacturing industry – continues to penalise car brands that seek to include more safety and technology in their models as standard. Now, many taxes being proposed for EVs will be redundant as consumers (and specifically EV adopters) move to subscribership rather than ownership.
The decision made by state governments to help or hinder EV adoption in this country will have global consequences. As global demand for electric vehicles outstrips supply, Australia will be relegated to the bottom of the list. We should be looking at ways to make new safety technology and greener mobility options more affordable, not less. Ultimately, it’s the consumers that will lose, and not only in dollar terms.

The bill proposes a new funding agency be formed and that local communities be given the opportunity to invest in renewable projects built in their region.
The parliamentary House Standing Committee has now launched its inquiry into the bill and will soon offer recommendations which could determine the bill’s fate. The inquiry involves a submissions process which will be open to the public for just two weeks, closing on July 9.
MP Helen Haines has said the bill seeks to establish “a new relationship with energy for regional Australians,” by setting up a dedicated Australian Local Power Agency (ALPA) to support community-owned renewable energy projects.

— Helen Haines MP (@helenhainesindi) June 25, 2021

The federal MP has previously said the current methods of funding, including investments made by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), have proven highly effective in propagating Australia’s renewable energy boom, but tend to favour larger corporations and investors. The Australian Local Power Agency bill, on the other hand, seeks to establish a new federal government entity which would underwrite new medium-scale renewable projects and offer local communities ownership, ensuring the money generated at the sites remains in the local region.
“If the ALPA bills were legislated, a new $467 million agency would support regional communities to develop and invest in their own renewable energy projects,” Haines’ website reads.
The Australian Local Power Agency would enable community participation and ownership or part ownership of renewable projects via three avenues:
The bill was developed out of Haines’ Local Power Plan, launched in September 2020 after consultation with communities and energy experts, including Juliette Millbank of Totally Renewable Yackandandah, Ben McGowan from Indigo Power, and Marnie Shaw, a Research Leader in the Battery Storage and Integration Program at the Australian National University.
Haines says there are already more than 100 community energy groups in Australia, “and 13 in my electorate”, many of whom were represented in the Local Power Plan.
Haines has said that the new agency could use its proposed budget to support more than $4 billion of new clean energy investment over the next decade, while providing measurable outcomes in rebuilding and re-energising local communities.
Helen Haines has been pushing the issue of renewable energy in Australia alongside New South Wales independent MP Zali Steggall. In November 2020, Steggall proposed a Climate Change Act that would see Australia commit to a zero emissions target by 2050, and the establishment of an independent Climate Change Commission to advise government and monitor progress towards that goal.
The report from the parliamentary inquiry into Steggall’s own Climate Change Act bill is currently being finalising and is expected to be made public in the next two weeks. “A number of good amendments were proposed during the inquiry and we are in the process of implementing some them into the bills with the intention of reintroducing the Climate Change Bills to parliament after the winter break,” Steggall wrote in an email update about the bill’s progression, after concern was raised last week that it had been listed as “not proceeding” on the parliamentary website.

The reports, both the Project Assessment Conclusions Report (PACR), which is the final step in the RIT-T process, and the Wholesale Pricing Report supported by analysis from FTI Consulting, showed that the Marinus Link was a strong investment option at both ends of the energy market. 

Of the four proposed models for the Marinus Link, TasNetwork’s modelling says that the largest capacity option for the interconnector, a 1,500 MW, $3.5 billion project,  which the Morrison government fast-tracked last year and would link Tasmania to Victoria via subaqueous and underground electricity connection, is the best option and could be slated for earliest commissioning in 2027. Although, that is just the first 750 MW stage, with the second 750 MW stage likely to see completion in 2029. 
The PACR, conducted by Ernst & Young, found that the entire project, including its link to Victoria’s North West Transmission Developments, would, according to a statement, provide “greater benefits to the NEM than its cost.” 

Moreover, by providing the NEM access to Tasmania’s enormous and low-cost dispatchable energy and deep storage resources, FTI Consulting concluded that wholesale energy prices would also fall. 
“Accessing the existing spare and refurbished on-demand hydro capacity, along with cost-competitive pumped hydro potential, provides lower-cost on-demand energy compared with other solutions available to the NEM”, concluded Jason Mann, senior managing director of FTI Consulting. 
TasNetworks’ general manager of Project Marinus, Bess Clark, said in a statement that both reports attest to the “crucial role” the project could have in transforming the NEM. “Australia’s transition to renewables is happening quickly,” said Clark, “The National Electricity Market needs access to affordable, ‘on-demand’ energy and long duration deep storage to ensure the lights stay on and power bills stay low.” 
Tasmania’s ambition to become the Battery of the Nation hinges on the Marinus Link. “It will give Australians access to cheaper, clean, reliable energy and transform Tasmania into a renewable energy powerhouse,” continued Clark. 
“With Project Marinus, businesses and investors in mainland Australia will have the assurance of a stable power supply when solar and wind generation is not available and batteries have run out. Along with other major transmission projects, Project Marinus will become the backbone of a reliable, lower emissions NEM for the next decade and beyond.” 
Who Pays? 
Under current frameworks, modelling has suggested that Tasmania and Victoria would pay 100% of the costs of the project, while only reaping 34% of the benefits. Clark believes the costs should be more equally distributed. “Customers in all NEM regions will be better off with Project Marinus,” Clark said, “if interconnector project costs are allocated in line with the benefits customers receive.” 

Such a move would require a change of rules. But Clark believes “a beneficiary pays model is a fairer outcome to recover the Project Marinus costs over its 40-plus year service life.” 
Jason Mann agreed with Clarke, saying the benefit from the Marinus Link and additional Tasmanian renewables “is widely spread across the NEM, with all jurisdictions being better off. Therefore it is necessary to develop an approach that recovers the costs of Marinus proportionately from those who benefit from the link.”
It must also be said that an infrastructural development that would dramatically increase the presence of renewable energy in the NEM, cutting emissions while generating 2,800 direct and indirect jobs on both the mainland and in Tasmania.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/29/solar-fire-prevention-hinges-on-data/,"MARKETS,UNITED STATES",PV MAGAZINE,"JUNE 29, 2021",Solar fire prevention hinges on data,"From pv magazine USA
PV system fires have a tendency to strike a nerve within the industry. While rare compared to other system disaster events, such occurrences always garner considerable attention.
The issue with solar system fires is how little is known about them. Questions have lingered for years as to what the common causes are, where system failures are occurring, and how often these failures could happen. These questions are the same ones being pursued by Dr. John R. Balfour, president of High Performance PV, and Lawrence Shaw, chief solar systems engineer at Higher Powered, LLC.
To Balfour and Shaw, the most clear and pressing issue with preventing PV system fires is how little information is kept on them. All reported fires in the country are tracked by the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) using data given by local fire departments. However, when a solar system is determined to be the cause of a fire, that’s as deep as the reporting goes, with no exploration into specific failures or causation. Furthermore, if a responding fire department doesn’t have solar photovoltaics listed as an option in their reporting systems, it gets filed to the USFA miscellaneously.
As it stands, solar system fires are underreported, and sometimes not at all. Available information is dated and specific causations remain a mystery.
Faulty hardware, ageing components, and improper installation can be seen as a poor reflection on the industry at large. But Balfour says that this is an inconvenience that must be overcome to address a larger industry issue.
“Almost all of these issues are quite controllable,” said Balfour. “And that control goes back to having accurate shared information, i.e. component and system data.”
Balfour and Shaw came across case studies in Japan and Britain of solar system fires. Most of these fires were caused by ageing and failing system components, and a significant number of failures were attributed to components greater than or equal to seven years of age.
Typically, blame is often attributed to improper installation. However, small case studies are not enough to rule out installation issues as a contributing factor.
Many companies and owners of projects don’t want to share such information. However, this creates a circular issue in which we remain unaware of what causes solar system fires and how to prevent them.
Balfour and Shaw believe that the catalyst for more in-depth and informative data tracking will come from financiers and insurers of solar projects. If solar system fires become more frequent and/or destructive, they’ll become a legitimate industry-wide concern for project economics and reliability.
Financiers won’t want to approach projects without some level of certainty that the proper precautions are being taken, and insurers may not provide coverage to projects that aren’t implementing preventative O&M and other precautions. This is similar to what’s happening with solar projects in hail-prone regions, where research into hail damage mitigation and monitoring was sparked by the insurance industry.
To try to put a number on what these losses could look like, Shaw has developed a methodology to estimate the future costs and impacts from reported PV system sourced fires in California. By estimating the number of PV systems in the state that are older than seven years and using available data to track the number of fires in California annually, Shaw’s model is able to generally predict the amount of PV fires that will occur in California and what their cost will be.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/29/co2-pricing-may-prevent-cannibalisation-effect-of-wind-and-solar/,"MARKETS,GERMANY,SWEDEN,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 29, 2021",CO2 pricing may prevent cannibalisation effect of wind and solar,"From pv magazine Global
Policy interventions will be crucial for ensuring that the market value of solar and wind will not decrease significantly in the future and CO2 pricing is the best available tool to ensure that they will not end up cannibalising their own revenues.
These are the main conclusions of a study conducted by researchers from the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden and the Technische Universität Berlin in Germany, in which its authors claim that, if CO2 prices are used as policy incentives for solar and wind instead of common renewable portfolio standards, feed-in tariffs or feed-in premium payments, both renewable energy sources may maintain a sufficient market value to keep attracting investments. “We demonstrate that this holds in a power system model even at a penetration of solar and wind above 80%, which is much higher than is usually considered in the market value literature,” the scientists stated.
In their view, the conventional incentive policies tend to depress market prices, as they offer compensation outside of the market, while CO2 price policies do exactly the opposite, as they encourage low-emission generators to participate in the market, especially when power plants based on fossil-fuel generators are operating. “For the CO2 policy, consumers pay more than the generation cost, since they must also pay for CO2 emissions according to the prevailing CO2 price,” the Swedish-German group emphasised. “Both the costs of the variable renewable energy subsidies and the revenues from the CO2 tax can be passed on to consumers, so that consumers only pay the average system cost in the end, thereby evening out the difference between the policy regimes from the consumers’ perspective.”
In order to prevent the materialisation of a cannibalisation and zero profit scenario, and to reduce curtailment of renewables, flexibility options should be introduced in the energy systems. These include the deployment of new grid capacity, battery storage and green hydrogen, the cost of which should be included in a total system cost perspective, which the researchers consider a better approach than considering only the LCOE of the single renewable energy technologies to assess the potential loss of market value of renewables.
The academics described the declining market value of renewable energy power generation assets as a side effect of a technology-specific support policy and said that the total system cost approach offers the advantage of calculating this value regardless of the individual market structure. “By showing the strong dependence of market value on policy choice, we have thus resolved the apparent contradiction between the literature showing market value decline with penetration under support policies, and the literature showing that high penetrations of VRE can be cost-effective under CO2 policies,” they concluded.
Their model is presented in the paper “Decreasing market value of variable renewables can be avoided by policy action,” published in Energy Economics.
