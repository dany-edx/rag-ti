Well, unsurprisingly, bills play a major role – but so too does the desire to live more sustainably.
According to research conducted by Solahart, 71% of respondents said cutting down power bills was a key priority in choosing solar power. Almost half believe solar is a necessary part of our future, while wanting to live a more sustainable lifestyle was in the top three motivators for 38% of those searching for solar power.
Australians between the ages of 45 and 54 years of age most interested in embarking on the solar journey, perhaps because they are more likely to have the capital required. Climate change is the top concern for millennials and Gen Z, though their primary aspirations were found to be travel and investing in their own homes respectively.
In terms of which regions of Australia are best suited to solar, the Northern Territory ranked at the top in terms of daylight hours (Darwin receiving 8.8 hours daily, according to the Bureau of Meteorology), but was at the bottom for rooftop solar penetration.
South Australia was ranked fourth in its daylight hours (Adelaide coming in at 7.45 hours), but was the clear winner for solar penetration. Solahart’s General Manager, Stephen Cranch, believes this exemplifies the role of policy in realising the potential of natural assets.
“The South Australian Government has had a strong environmental agenda over the last 20 years, with plenty of solar and wind resources available,” he told pv magazine Australia.
“South Australia… has led the solar PV charge from its early beginnings, well before it became a mainstream product.”
Global eyes are now on this PV pioneering state as it battles with the problem of too much renewable energy going into the grid in the middle of the day when demand is low, a phenomenon known as the duck-curve.
“The rest of the world is watching how this problem is being solved with energy storage trials like the roll out of home batteries, inverter voltage ride through requirements (curtailing solar system outputs), and the SA Smart Network, Australia’s first grid interactive smart-electric water heater program,” Cranch said.
While solar PV covers 21% of Australia’s residential rooftops, far fewer Australian businesses and industrial premises have decided to harvest energy from their roofs – just 5% to be precise. It’s something Cranch notes is “surprising considering the return on investment can be very compelling.”
“Although the awareness of solar is high in Australia, with just 5% of potential rooftop space [used], more could always be done to help drive the uptake of solar technologies.
Solahart
“Many households and businesses are on the verge of making the decision to reduce their energy bills with this great renewable source, however, are hesitating as they don’t know who to trust or turn to for advice due to conflicting information from a myriad of unknown brands and companies.”
To ensure Australia’s solar wave continues, Cranch says its imperative the country extends its Renewable Energy Target, which underpins Small-scale and Large-scale Technology Certificate creation, beyond its end date in 2030.
“To ensure grid-stability as the uptake of solar continues to grow, it may be necessary for governments to incentivise the roll out of energy storage devices such as smart-electric grid-interactive water heaters,” he added.
“This would be far more cost effective than batteries and will help to soak up excess solar energy during the day rather than it being sent back to the grid. The uptake of electric vehicles (once the premium over internal combustion engine vehicles is reduced) will create more demand for solar PV particularly once bidirectional chargers are more affordable and commercially available and can interact with the energy grid.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/21/tasmanian-sheep-farm-installs-flow-battery-based-microgrid-system/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,TASMANIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 21, 2021",Tasmanian sheep farm installs flow battery-based microgrid system,"Simon Hackett’s 73-hectare working sheep farm, The Vale, has now achieved energy independence through the deployment of 100 kilowatt-peak solar array and energy storage system consisting of 28 Redflow 10 kWh ZBM2  zinc-bromine flow batteries. The final deployment caps an extensive design and development processing undertaken during the past year by Tasmanian company DMS Energy.
Hackett, who leads Redflow’s software and integration efforts as its Systems Integration Architect, said the system would eliminate grid electricity costs for the property. “We expect this system to be self-sufficient, with a net negative energy bill. From now on, the Tasmanian power grid is merely a backup energy source for The Vale,” Hackett said.
“The battery array makes extensive use of the Redflow Standby Power System (SPS) mode, allowing batteries to be fully charged during good solar weather days, and to then be ‘hibernated’ with zero self-discharge. During extended overcast periods, the SPS batteries are automatically activated to support site loads instead of using the grid. This unique strength of Redflow’s ZBM2 batteries allows the site to maximise both energy storage quantity and also energy storage efficiency.”
Redflow
The property’s new energy system comprises of high-capacity, three-phase power wiring and a multi-gigabit speed single-mode optic fibre network ring, run underground to all buildings on the property. The major undergrounding project included going under a river and beneath the property’s aircraft runway, which is the longest private runway in Tasmania.
The system uses a cluster of 12 x 15KVA Victron Quattro inverter/chargers and control systems that can deliver a peak energy output of 180KVA.
The system’s energy come from the ground-mounted 100kWp solar array, which Hackett plans to expand this to 200kWp in future. The goal is to create an energy ‘fuel station’ that will serve electric tractors and other electric farm equipment that will eventually replace the existing fleet of diesel machinery.
While normally grid-interactive, the system can switch automatically and seamlessly to ‘off-grid’ mode any time the grid is not available. The solar array remains fully operative in off-grid mode, able both to power the farm and recharge the batteries.

Nonetheless, the $275.5 million earmarked for hydrogen includes money to implement a clean hydrogen certification scheme, which was warmly welcomed by the Australian Hydrogen Council as a “critical step that will give our trading partners confidence.” Thankfully, few seem as credulous as the federal government to the future of fossil fuels in the budding hydrogen sector.
The main focus of the extra hydrogen funding, however, will be to develop four more hydrogen production hubs in regional areas. Potential locations for regional hydrogen hubs include:
The hydrogen funding will be dolled out over five years, while money for carbon capture technology will be allocated over decade. The extra federal funding comes as most of Australia’s states and territories are also throwing money behind hydrogen projects in a groundswell to make Australia a key player in the global hydrogen export market by 2030. The aim is to drive down the cost of hydrogen production to less than $2 a kilogram so it can compete against fossil fuels.
“This funding for clean hydrogen hubs is exactly the kind of investment we need from federal government to propel the Australian hydrogen industry forward to ensure we are competitive globally,” CEO of the Australian Hydrogen Council, Dr Fiona Simon, said.
“Australia can step up to the mark and be a leader in hydrogen exports, while also creating thousands of sustainable jobs at home.”
“We look forward to working with the federal government to develop clean hydrogen hubs, progress hydrogen projects across the nation and create a robust certification process,”
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the extra $539.2 million in funding will create 2500 jobs, though his statement did not clarify specifically where he believes those jobs will come from.
The $263.7 million the government devoted to Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) research and hubs was received more coldly, indicative of the way the technology is view by many in the clean energy industry – which is far less convinced than government of its relevance.
With the money, the government is seeking to develop CCS hubs potentially in:
Western Australia is already home to the world’s largest CCS project, which attached to the Gorgon Gas Plant. Australia’s Climate Council say the project is proof CCS technology simply “doesn’t work.”
“Carbon capture and storage in the fossil fuel sector is best described as an expensive failure,” the Council’s website reads. “After decades of CCS research and billions of dollars invested around the world, including here in Australia, there is little to show for it. In fact, when CCS is attached to coal and gas power stations it is likely to be at least six times more expensive than electricity generated from wind power backed by battery storage.
“There are still no successful projects operating anywhere in the world.”
The Clean Energy Council’s Chief Executive, Kane Thornton, responded to the news similarly. “Australian taxpayers have very little to show for over $1 billion spent so far in support of CCS, and it would be a far better outcome to channel this funding into driving down the cost of renewable hydrogen,” he said in a statement.
The Biden administration, which is leading the virtual climate summit beginning on Thursday evening, has dramatically shifted the United States’ direction on climate action in its first 100 days of power.
It is expected the global leader will announce more ambitious 2030 targets after already committing to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s new funding allocations and change in rhetoric look rather lacklustre in comparison. On Monday, however, Morrison did concede Australia’s energy mix needs to change over the next 30 years “on the road to net zero emissions.”
The Coalition has come under fire for refusing to follow the rest of the world’s 2050 targets. A stance which is looking increasingly untenable as global cooperation mounts, and which Morrison’s recent comments seem to acknowledge.
“We cannot pretend the world is not changing,” Morrison said on Tuesday. ”If we do, we run the risk of stranding jobs in this country, especially in regional areas.”
“There is a strong appetite from business for the new emissions reduction technologies that they know will be needed to run their operations and keep employing Australians and grow jobs for the future,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/21/morrison-continues-to-deflect-net-zero-2050-commitments-despite-growing-international-pressure/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"APRIL 21, 2021",Morrison continues to deflect net zero 2050 commitments despite growing international pressure,"Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison gave a speech on Monday at the Business Council of Australia (BCA) in which, under heightening global pressure, particularly from the Biden Administration in the United States, he continued to make no commitments to 2050 net zero emissions. 
The speech came on the same day as South Australia signed a $1.08 billion joint funding deal with the Federal Government to increase gas extraction as a pathway to emissions reduction. However, the deal will also see $100 million in joint support for Project EnergyConnect, a superhighway of new electricity transmission infrastructure connecting South Australia and New South Wales, with a diversion into Victoria, which promises to unlock gigawatts of planned renewable energy projects in its path, and help stabilise the tail end of the National Electricity Market, facilitating bi-directional energy flows as needed.
According to the ABC, Morrison’s speech is a sign that he is inching closer to committing Australia to an emissions target of net zero by 2050, despite further politicising the issue by appearing “to mock those inner-city voters who have long campaigned for climate action, stating, ‘we will not achieve net zero in the cafes, dinner parties and wine bars of our inner cities.’ He said that net zero will be ‘won’ by the energy, industrial, agriculture, mining and manufacturing sectors, pointing to work BHP, Andrew Forrest and AGL are doing to reduce emissions as examples.”

Of course, if those inner-city pinot-fuelled protestors at cafes, dinner parties and wine bars hadn’t kept the conversation about climate action going for all the years the Coalition has been trying to silence it, then he would probably still be pretending there isn’t a climate problem. In fact, he would probably still be in Hawaii on vacation. 
According to Wood Mackenzie Asia Pacific Head of Markets and Transitions, Prakash Sharma, “Australia’s desire to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 is a step in the right direction. Australia’s major trading partners – China, Japan and South Korea – are already in transition towards that goal. That means Australia will need to retool its commodity exports industry to align with the Paris climate targets.” 
Of course, a net zero target by 2050 remains deeply unpopular within the Coalition and Morrison refused to make such a commitment while ruling out the prospect of a carbon tax entirely, despite yesterday’s virtual greenhouse gas summit with US President Biden. 
“Our analysis shows that Australia can reach net-zero emissions before 2050,” continued Sharma, “Although the pathway requires complete transformation of its traditional energy and export sectors, there are new opportunities to capitalise on. “This will require Australia to become a significant player in low-carbon hydrogen trade as well as being able to offer carbon storage and offset services. Total carbon removal capacity reaches approximately 200 Mt per annum by 2050 in Australia.”
According to Wood Mackenzie analysis, 83% of power generation will come from solar and wind by 2050, while natural gas, bio energy, geothermal and small modular reactor combined will provide the other 17%. Wood Mackenzie expects coal to be entirely phased out by 2035. 
Morrison has strongly supported gas and coal despite the small role gas is predicted to play in Australia’s future, and the extinction of coal altogether. “The key to meeting our climate change ambitions” said Morrison, “is the commercialisation of low emissions technology.”
Instead of mocking inner-city wine swillers for being demonstrably right, Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese also gave a speech on Monday in which he said “It is time to look at the other side of the coin – the huge potential for clean energy to create hundreds of thousands of secure, well-paid jobs.”
“I’m not just talking about jobs for people mining lithium, copper and nickel or those who transform those materials into batteries,” continued Albanese, “I’m talking about a revolution in jobs growth right across the Australian economy based on one inescapable fact – renewable energy is not only clean, but cheap, and getting cheaper.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/21/shaded-solar-parks-found-to-be-beneficial-for-pollinators-and-plants-alike/,"MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 21, 2021",Shaded solar parks found to be beneficial for pollinators and plants alike,"From pv magazine Global
Pollinating insects visit flowers even if these grow under the panels of a solar park and the modules’ shade is also beneficial for delaying the timing of floral blooms, which in turn has a positive effect on the abundance and diversity of the pollinator themselves.
This is the main conclusion of the study “Partial shading by solar panels delays bloom, increases floral abundance during the late-season for pollinators in a dryland, agrivoltaic ecosystem,” recently published in scientific reports, in which scientists from the Oregon State University in the U.S. have investigated if coupling PV with the habitat for wild and managed pollinators can help increase biodiversity and agricultural health.
“Some states, such as Minnesota, North Carolina, Maryland, Vermont, and Virginia, have developed statewide guidelines and incentives to promote pollinator-focused solar installations,” the scientists state. “In this practice, forage for pollinators is established as the solar array’s understory rather than the traditional turf grass or gravel.”
Their work began from the assumption that the panel’s partial shading is able to create a microclimate that favours the abundant growth of more varied flowers and pollinators compared to plots with no shade, particularly during summer months. Their measurements were taken at a 10 MW solar plant located on an 18 hectare surface in Jackson County, Oregon.
The project site was previously utilised for cattle grazing and hosts vegetation such as non-native rhizomatous grasses and non-native forbs. “By nature of the installation process, some surface vegetation was removed, and surface soils were disturbed in areas where solar panels were installed,” the paper notes. “After installation, the site was prepared for restoration with native plants.” In 2018, native forbs and grasses were planted with the aim of creating an ideal habitat for both pollinators.
Data on pollinator and plant populations were collected seven times each over two-day periods in 2019 during July, August, and September. The analysis considered full shade areas with only 5% of sunlight, partial shade plots with 75% of sunlight, and portions with 100% of sunlight. The academics collected data from net radiation, air temperature, and relative humidity at 15-minute intervals at a height of 1.4 m.
Insect specimens were collected to inventory pollinating insect composition in plots. “Our unreplicated climate observations showed that solar panel shading alters the solar radiation, soil temperature, soil moisture, and vapour pressure deficit across treatments,” the US group stated. “Full shade plots experienced reduced further soil temperature and when compared to both full sun and partial shade plots.”
Floral abundance was found to be more abundant in partial shade plots, where around 4% more blooms were reported compared to both full sun and full shade plots. 342 pollinating insects representing 65 different species were collected, including native bees (45%) flies (20%), honey bees (12%), beetles (12%), wasps (7%), and others (3%). Insect species abundance was found to be higher in partial shade and full sun than in full shade.
“At our site, partial shading by solar panels increased bloom abundance by delaying bloom timing, increasing forage for pollinators during the hot, dry, late season — a time when nutrition is particularly important,” the scientists concluded, adding that this positive outcome should be the results of a series of factors including photoperiodicity, photosynthetic efficiency, a decrease in soil temperature and moisture on germination, and root establishment.
“Unused or under-utilised lands below solar panels represent an opportunity to augment the expected decline of pollinator habitat,” said research co-author Maggie Graham. “Near agricultural lands, this also has the potential to benefit the surrounding agricultural community and presents an avenue for future study.”
In previous research, the same research group had developed a model to assess the overlap between solar potential and underlying land use. The researchers concluded that croplands, grasslands, and wetlands are the top three land classes for PV projects linked to agricultural activities, while barren terrain, traditionally prioritised for solar PV system installation, ranked fifth.
In another paper, the Oregon State University group stated that using land for both solar photovoltaic power and agriculture could provide 20% of total electricity generation in the United States.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/21/indian-firm-acquires-american-hydrogen-cylinder-maker-in-bid-to-further-market-domination/,"HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,INDIA,UNITED STATES",PV MAGAZINE,"APRIL 21, 2021",Indian firm acquires American hydrogen cylinder maker in bid to further market domination,"From pv magazine India
New Delhi-headquartered Uttam Group of Companies, a global manufacturer of ultra-lightweight composite cylinders and systems for compressed natural gas and hydrogen, has closed on the purchase of US-based Catalina Composites. The new entity, based in California, will now be known as Uttam Composites.
The strategic move comes as the Indian multinational sees demand skyrocketing for clean energy solutions, particularly in compressed natural gas and hydrogen, and believes the expansion will help it grow.
The acquisition will allow Uttam to expand to the U.S. and Europe, in addition to dominating the Asian market. Their business in India, Uttam Cylinders, has had a compounded annual growth rate of more than 60% in the last three years.
Speaking to pv magazine, Uttam chief executive officer Karan Bhatia said, “Hydrogen infrastructure is the key [to clean energy transition]. As refuelling stations become accessible and widespread, the adoption of hydrogen vehicles will skyrocket. Uttam’s advantage is that our cylinders are not only the lightest but the most durable on the market because of our proprietary manufacturing process.”

“India is an emerging market for hydrogen and will continue to grow under the Indian Government’s ambition to invest in hydrogen infrastructure. Uttam is the market leader in ultra-lightweight, high-pressure cylinders for both CNG and hydrogen, and with this acquisition, we will be able to meet our overwhelming demand,” Bhatia added.
Uttam will be investing at least $20 million to expand staff, purchase new machinery and invest in research and development of new product lines.
The 107,000-square-foot facility, which produces thousands of cylinders a year, has already doubled its staff from 11 to 22 employees and will grow to around 50 people in the next two years.
Catalina Composites said the company is in good hands. “The long-term prospects of the composites business under the ownership of the acquiring company are significantly more favourable than other available alternatives,’’ Catalina wrote to its employees in announcing the sale.
Uttam Group of Companies is a family-owned conglomerate established in 1900 that serves a wide array of customers and locations — from the Indian Army at the Siachen Glacier, the highest battleground on earth, to the Indian Space Research Organisation’s mission to Mars.
