Technically dense, the method reportedly does not require the high temperatures, high pressure and big infrastructure currently needed to produce ammonia – a compound mostly used in agricultural fertilisers, but which has also become crucial for hydrogen proponents. 
The technique builds on previous research from the same UNSW team, with lead researcher Dr. Ali Jalili explaining then that his group and colleagues had devised proof-of-concept lab experiments which used plasma, a form of lightning made in a tube, to convert atmospheric nitrogen in air into an intermediary known as NOx – either NO2- (nitrite) or NO3- (nitrate). The nitrogen in these compounds is much more reactive than N2 in the air.
“Working with our University of Sydney colleagues, we designed a range of scalable plasma reactors that could generate the NOx intermediary at a significant rate and high energy efficiency,” he said. “Once we generated that intermediary in water, designing a selective catalyst and scaling the system became significantly easier. The breakthrough of our technology was in the design of the high-performance plasma reactors coupled with electrochemistry.”
The foundation of this research has been licensed to an Australian industry partner, PlasmaLeap Technologies, but the team have now published a new paper in the journal Applied Catalysis B: Environmental. In it, they say they have made significant advances in energy efficiency and production rate, thus improving commercial profitability.

In this new study, the team said they “explored the integration of non-thermal plasma and electrochemical processes.”
“However, the success of this hybrid process is contingent on the energy efficiency of the plasma-generated species. Herein, we developed a plasma bubble reactor, driven by nanosecond pulses interfacing plasma directly with water.”
“By using on-and-off plasma ignition with rapid pulses, we could regulate energy consumption in cycles and achieved the lowest reported energy consumption of 2.7 ± 0.1 kWh mol-1 NO3− and 3.2 ± 0.1 kWh mol-1 NH4+ after electrocatalytic nitrate reduction.”

Tailem Bend, owned by Singapore-based Vena Energy, had its first stage, the 95 MW Tailem Bend 1, enter operations back in 2019. At the time, it was one of South Australia’s largest solar projects.
Tailem Bend 2, which saw the addition of 87 MW of new solar, bringing the total project to 182 MW, took nine months to be fully commissioned after its energisation in February. 
The project, located east of Adelaide, will soon be coupled with a 41.5 MW battery with one hour of storage. The battery is currently in the installation phases and is expected to enter operations in early 2024.
UGL have been contracted to construct and maintain the Tailem Bend project.
Vena Energy – the former Equis Energy – is owned by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). It was acquired in a  US$5 billion deal in 2017.

At the time, the company said the Taurus would be able to handle loads of up to 70 tonnes – but none of the company’s channels specify its current haulage. Its website, however, states the prime movers have a range of 400 kilometres, though in the Stockhead announcement a figure of 600 kilometres is given.
The 6×4 Prime Mover is supplied by HDrive, the company’s website says, though it stresses the vehicle’s Australian design.

Pure Hydrogen’s sales manager, Clint Butler, says the Taurus prime mover “can be on the road in nine months from time of order,” adding that this turnaround is quicker than a tradition diesel truck today.
Following the Brisbane showcase, Pure Hydrogen took a Taurus truck to one of PepsiCo Australia’s Brisbane manufacturing sites for trialling.
Pure Hydrogen is also pursuing an agreement with Australia’s largest privately-owned waste management company, JJ Waste & Recycling. In March 2022, it announced it would work with the company to put hydrogen-powered garbage trucks on the streets of south east of Queensland before 2022 is out. While that date passed, the agreement remains in place with Pure Hydrogen saying in October that the development and construction work was “nearing completion.”
The use of hydrogen in vehicles has been a hotly debated in Australia, but found a foothold in the heavy vehicle and trucking sector. This is because unlike electric vehicles, which well and truly hold marketshare when it comes to passenger cars, the batteries needed for big trucks are extremely heavy and require downtime to charge.

The company is reportedly planning to use the leased tracts of land to build renewable projects, according to the Australian Financial Review. Fortescue has estimated it will need between 2 GW and 3 GW of renewable generation and storage to meet its 2030 target to cut fossil fuels out of its mining operations.
The applications were filed by Fortescue on October 27, with the land parcels largely covered by broad land use agreements between Fortescue and the Nyamal and Pakyka traditional owners groups.
Despite the nearness of its 2030 target, Fortescue says it has not yet settled on a plan to reach the goal and declined to provide with an estimate the land footprint required. “We have identified multiple areas east of our Iron Bridge [magnetite mine] operation that are potentially suitable to support our decarbonisation plans,” a Fortescue spokesperson told the Australian Financial Review.

Plug Power‘s stock fell more than 30% on the Nasdaq on Friday, following its report stating that its 2023 financial performance was negatively affected by unprecedented supply challenges in the North American hydrogen network, despite a more than threefold increase in electrolyser sales. The New York-based company said it will seek additional capital to fund its activities, expressing confidence that the hydrogen supply issue is temporary, expecting full capacity production at its Georgia and Tennessee facilities by year end.
Air Products has partnered with Chinese state-owned Chengzhi, aiming to accelerate transport decarbonisation in China’s Yangtze River Delta. The joint venture has launched a commercial-scale hydrogen fueling station in Changshu, Jiangsu province, fueling public transport and logistics trucks. The president of Chengzhi, Wei Junmin, expressed excitement about deepening collaboration to expedite hydrogen vehicle development and the hydrogen value chain.
Japan and South Korea are set to collaborate on a supply chain for hydrogen and ammonia, with plans to announce the initiative during the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit in the United States. Additionally, the two nations will create new frameworks in quantum technology and semiconductors.
Yanmar Power Technology said that it has delivered its first commercialized maritime hydrogen fuel cell system to the passenger ship Hanaria, operated by Motena-Sea. The comprehensive power system design includes two hydrogen fuel cells, batteries, and biodiesel generators, marking a milestone for the Osaka-based company.
Air Liquide and Siemens Energy have inaugurated their gigawatt electrolyzer factory in Berlin, aiming to increase production from 1 GW to an annual capacity of 3 GW by 2025. The Franco-German partnership, spanning over 2,000 square meters in Berlin, utilizes automation and robotics for Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer module production. The joint venture said that it aims to play a pivotal role in fostering a sustainable hydrogen economy.
