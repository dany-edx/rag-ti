https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/13/farewell-liddell-what-to-expect-when-australias-oldest-coal-plant-closes/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",,"APRIL 13, 2023",Farewell Liddell: what to expect when Australia’s oldest coal plant closes,"Liddell, in the New South Wales Hunter Valley, is Australia’s oldest coal station. It started operations in the early 1970s – about the same time the Datsun 180B was released, and before the Sydney Opera House officially opened!
In the same way a Datsun 180B was a great car in its day, Liddell was the cheapest and most reliable electricity generation technology in the 1970s and 1980s (at least if you ignore the long-term costs of carbon).
But like all coal-fired power stations in Australia, Liddell’s performance declined as it aged. It became unreliable and inefficient. One unit of the station closed last year, leaving three operating.
Governments must act to make sure our electricity grid doesn’t fall short when coal plants close. But the demise of facilities such as Liddell means Australia has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to become a global energy superpower.

AGL announced the decision to close Liddell in 2015. Virtually no one in the energy industry argued against the move, but it triggered endless political debate.
Some politicians are still railing against Liddell’s retirement. Federal Nationals leader David Littleproud this week said the closure should be delayed to prevent supply problems, and suggested Australia should have an urgent conversation about building nuclear energy.
But closing Liddell is unlikely to cause the lights to go off in NSW. For now, the state has enough remaining capacity to ensure reliable supply.
In the eight years since the decision to close Liddell, large-scale renewable capacity in NSW has ramped up, as has new rooftop solar.
Plenty of new “firming” capacity is also being developed – that is, flexible energy capacity to be activated if renewables aren’t producing energy or electricity demand suddenly increases. Projects under construction in NSW include the Kurri Kurri and Tallawarra gas-fired power stations, the Waratah “super battery” and the Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project.
When electricity consumption in NSW is at its highest, about 14,000 MW of power is required. Without Liddell, about 13,500 MW of coal, gas and hydro generation is available.
Add in existing wind and solar capacity, plus energy that can be imported from Victoria and Queensland via transmission lines, and total generation capacity in NSW looks to be more than enough.
However, the reliability of some of this remaining capacity – namely, remaining coal-fired power stations – is becoming less certain. That’s why the energy industry is looking past Liddell, to the closure of the Eraring coal plant in 2025, and others to follow.
 
Modelling by the Australian Energy Market Operator shows the closure of Eraring puts pressure on remaining electricity supply. However, it says the market would still meet the grid “reliability standard”, even if no new projects are developed.
Under that standard, expected unserved energy needs (leading to blackouts) should be no more than 0.002% of total energy used in a region. The standard assumes that while the occasional blackout is inconvenient, eliminating them completely is unfeasible because it would require building expensive power stations that are rarely used.
Blackouts could become more common, if extreme weather hits or coal units fail – which happened at Queensland’s Callide C power station in 2021. But blackouts are still far more likely to be the result of a power line problem in your street than a lack of generation capacity.

No electricity supply shortfalls are projected for Australia in the near-term. But to ensure the clean energy transition happens smoothly, we should develop new renewable energy and firming capacity ahead of coal closures.
The earlier-than-expected closure of coal units remains a possibility – as occurred with Victoria’s Hazelwood coal station due to unaffordable repair costs.
We have previously recommended a “waiting room” for capacity that can be brought quickly into the market when required. Batteries and pumped hydro would be developed ahead of coal closures, and brought into the market as soon as coal exits.
The NSW Minns Labor government can also bring forward investment through an existing policy called the NSW Energy Roadmap. This involves asking the Australian Energy Market Operator to enter into long-term contracts to underwrite new renewable energy and firming projects, to help reduce the financial risks proponents face.
One tender round is already under way, but this could be accelerated. Given the global energy crunch, it may be worth commissioning projects now, even if delivery is not required until later. This is a much better way to manage reliability than, for example, the NSW government using taxpayer money to buy Eraring – an option NSW Labor left on the table ahead of last month’s state election.
In the longer term, construction of renewable generation must dramatically scale up to ensure energy reliability and meet emissions reduction targets.
This will be challenging. But we can take heart from news this week that under the federal Albanese government, renewables projects are being approved at twice the rate of previous years.

There’s more work to be done to make sure the electricity grid can withstand coal plant closures.
Many new transmission lines must be built to carry electricity from renewables generators to the grid. And the ongoing development of renewable energy zones – clusters of large-scale renewable energy projects – will make establishing new projects quicker and simpler.
Importantly, local communities and First Nations people must be engaged and consulted throughout the transition.
But while adjusting to the exit of coal brings challenges, nuclear power in Australia is unlikely to be the answer.
Australia has world-class wind and solar resources – enough to eventually produce clean, cheap energy for ourselves and for export. Technologies such as batteries, hydrogen and hydro will fill the gaps when needed.
Producing energy from emerging nuclear technologies in the form of “small modular reactors”, as proposed by Littleproud, will be still be more than twice the cost of Australian renewable energy firmed by batteries or other storage technologies, even under the most ambitious scenarios. This gives Australia a global competitive advantage.
Liddell’s closure is an historic moment in the Australian energy landscape. Now, with tweaks to existing policies, the new NSW government can increase reliability, lower electricity prices and get on the path to net-zero.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/13/agl-gets-green-light-for-torrens-island-big-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 13, 2023",AGL gets green light for Torrens Island big battery,"AGL’s $180 million Torrens Island battery energy storage system is approaching commercial operation with South Australia’s electricity transmission network owner ElectraNet confirming it has executed the transmission connection agreement following the approval of performance standards by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).
The one-hour-duration battery is being developed at the site of AGL’s gas-fired Torrens Island power station and will be used to support South Australia’s energy transition, providing essential capacity when renewable generation is impacted and during periods of high demand.
“Full energisation and commissioning activities for AGL’s Torrens Island battery will happen in the next few weeks.” Electranet’s Manager Customer Connections Niketan Tyagi said.
“We have been providing essential support in the testing and commissioning of the auxiliary load of this project while waiting for the required performance standards to be approved by the Australia Energy Market Operator and our team.”
AGL’s project director for the battery, Thomas Hill, said the execution of the connection agreement is a significant milestone for the energy storage system, which features grid-forming technology and will initially focus on providing grid services.

The battery, being delivered by Finnish technology company Wärtsilä, is initially sized at 250 MW and 250 MWh but expansion plans allow for up to 1,000 MWh, or four hours of storage capacity.
“The Torrens Island battery is an important asset, both for AGL’s portfolio and the state of South Australia,” Hill said.
“The battery will support the uptake of greater levels of renewable energy, improve the security and reliability of the grid and help to put downward pressure on power prices. It’s also a key pillar of our plan to transition the Torrens Island site into an integrated, low-carbon industrial energy hub.”
The Torrens Island project forms part of AGL’s ambition to have 5 GW of new renewables and firming in place by 2030, expanding upon a 2.9 GW pipeline of renewable generation and energy storage projects in active planning and development.
Among the company’s other energy storage projects is a 200 MW, four-hour duration grid-scale battery to be built at the Loy Yang A power station site in Victoria, and a 500 MW/2 GWh battery at the soon-to-be-closed Liddell power station in New South Wales.
It has received the tick of approval from NSW planning authorities for a 50MW/100MWh battery in Broken Hill, and It has announced a deal with Maoneng Group to buy capacity from four 50 MW /100 MWh batteries in NSW and is already operating the 100 MW/150 MWh Wandoan South battery in Queensland and the 30 MW/8MWh BESS at Dalrymple in South Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/13/lodestone-breaks-ground-on-32-mw-solar-farm-in-nz/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW ZEALAND",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 13, 2023",Lodestone breaks ground on 32 MW solar farm in NZ,"Lodestone Energy has commenced construction of the 32 MW Edgecumbe Solar Farm after announcing it has reach financial close on the project being developed in the Bay of Plenty Region on New Zealand’s North Island.
The Edgecumbe Solar Farm, being built near the town of the same name, will comprise approximately 60,000 Trina PV modules with tracking technology and when complete is expected to generate about 53 GWh of clean energy per annum, enough to supply more than 6,000 New Zealand homes and businesses.
Lodestone Energy Managing Director Gary Holden said the project is the second of five solar farms included in the company’s first phase of growth and the start of construction follows on from the start of construction of the 39.4 MW Kaitaia Solar Farm in December.
“Today we’ve reached financial close on our Edgecumbe site,” Holden said. “We’ve got our senior debt facility in place with Westpac and have engaged Infratec New Zealand to construct the farm.”
Holden said the solar farms are underpinned by long-term power purchase agreements with retailers Pulse Energy and Prime Energy with the first of the projects to be generating clean energy before the end of 2023.
“We’re underway in Kaitaia and expect to be generating electricity on in the second half of this year,” he said. “In early 2024, we’ll also be generating electricity at Edgecumbe, and we have a further three sites already confirmed and underway.”
The company is also developing solar farms in Dargaville, Waiotahe Valley and Whitianga, and is also looking for other sites to build on with a number of locations “under advanced stages of investigation.”
Lodestone said each of its solar farms is designed to allow stock grazing and horticulture to continue around and underneath the solar infrastructure, ensuring it maximises New Zealand’s renewable energy output in the most sustainable way.
The company said the approach will allow the land to continue to be productive, with more than 85% of baseline farming yield expected when the solar farm is operational.

The estimated $400 million (USD 268 million) grid-scale battery energy storage system, to be deployed at Williamsdale on the ACT’s southeast border, will be developed, built and operated by Eku Energy. Construction is due to start in late 2024 with completion expected in 2025.
The Williamsdale battery will form part of the Big Canberra Battery project, a planned network of distributed battery systems that will be built throughout the city to form an energy storage ecosystem that can be coordinated and orchestrated to meet the needs of the grid.
The territory government said the energy storage ecosystem will be able to respond to network constraints “in just a few milliseconds” and will store enough renewable energy to power one-third of Canberra for two hours during peak demand periods.
ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said the partnership with Eku is a significant step in the delivery of the Big Canberra Battery project which is a “critical component” of the government’s commitment to achieve net zero emissions in the territory by 2045.
“When I first announced the Big Canberra Battery project we had three objectives in mind; grow jobs in our renewable energy sector, create a meaningful revenue stream for the territory and improve energy security for Canberrans – this contract delivers on all three of those objectives,” he said.
“As a combined network, this battery ecosystem can address network constraints, enable more Canberrans to reap solar benefits and present the opportunity for the territory to reduce costs and generate revenue.”
The Williamsdale battery will be operated under an “innovative” financing deal that will see the ACT government receive a share of the revenue from the merchant operations of the battery in the National Electricity Market.
The battery will also provide a range of energy and essential system security services and in exchange, the territory will provide Eku with fixed quarterly payments over 15 years.
Eku Energy Asia Pacific Director and Chief Investment Officer Daniel Burrows said the company’s involvement in the project continues its rapid expansion since it was launched late last year.
“The Big Canberra Battery represents a significant milestone for Eku Energy as we celebrate our first GWh of battery energy storage in delivery in Australia,” he said. “This brings our global portfolio of battery energy storage assets to over 4 GWh.”
Created by Macquarie’s Green Investment Group (GIG), Eku was established to “take advantage of opportunities in electrification and grid investment around the world.”
Burrows said the standalone business will develop, build, and manage a portfolio of energy storage assets across various markets, revenue, and contracting structures. The company’s portfolio includes utility scale battery projects in the United Kingdom, Japan, Taiwan and Australia.
Its Australian projects include a 150 MW/150 MWh project at the site of the decommissioned Hazelwood coal-fired power station in Victoria and the 200 MW/400 MWh Rangebank big battery that it is building on the outskirts of Melbourne in partnership international energy giant Shell.
The Williamsdale battery, and the broader Big Canberra Battery project is in addition to the more than 100 MW of battery projects being developed in the ACT by French renewables giant Neoen and Australian developer Global Power Generation.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/13/monumental-mistake-experts-alarmed-by-major-nsw-victoria-interconnector-plan/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,POLICY,QUALITY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 13, 2023",‘Monumental mistake’: experts alarmed by major NSW-Victoria interconnector plan,"Simon Bartlett, former Powerlink COO, University of Queensland Professor and member of the National Electricity Market’s Reliability Panel, has coauthored a scathing consultation submission to the Australia Energy Market Operator (AEMO), alongside Professor Bruce Mountain, Director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre at Victoria University.
The pair claim one of AEMO’s cornerstone transmission projects, the Western Renewables Link and VNI West (WRL-VNI), will triple transmission charges in Victoria, make the states susceptible to natural disaster blackouts, and will ultimately increase grid congestion.
“Our critique has examined the situation in Victoria, but we would expect the same conclusions apply in respect of the NSW part of WRL-VNI,” Bartlett and Mountain write in the foreword, addressed to AEMO CEO Daniel Westerman.

The proposed Western Renewables Link and VNI West project entails a 500 kV interconnector running from the outskirts of Melbourne, through Western Victoria and into New South Wales. If developed, the project will be the biggest single expense in the Victorian transmission system in more than 50 years, Bartlett and Mountain claim.
The project is also an integral part of AEMO’s energy masterplan, known as its Integrated System Plan or ISP. Bartlett and Mountain acknowledge this rather uncomfortable fact, noting the wide ramifications of their critique.
“After this long [submission] process, we are left with no option but to conclude… that AVP [AEMO Victorian Planner] has delivered a [project] recommendation that relies on biased, flawed and in parts dishonest analysis. We appreciate the seriousness of these allegations but our duty to our professions leaves us with no option but to make them.”
The submission stands in stark contrast to what proponents and governments have been claiming about the interconnector, which is usually hailed as the key to unlocking 1.8 GW of renewable capacity between Australia’s two most populace states.
The regulatory assessment stage for VNI West interconnector closes in early 2023, with the authors noting the Victorian Government used its legislative powers to make the Consultation Report, to which this submission responds, the last step in the regulatory approval process.
In February, AEMO was cleared to start early works on the VNI West project and its Environment Effects Statement is expected a year earlier than originally anticipated. The VNI West is aiming for completion by 2028.
The project’s acceleration appears rather troubling in light of Bartlett and Mountain’s critique, with the pair accusing the AVP, the Victorian planning division of AEMO, of “badly under-estimating” the project costs, particularly of the option it prefers.
While the pair do not have access to AEMO’s own modelling, they estimate the project would double transmission charges in Victoria and lay the foundation for further transmission developments that together will triple transmission charges in Victoria. 
“WRL-VNI will also detrimentally affect the efficiency of the Victorian power system by wasting existing transmission capacity (the extensive 500 kV and 220 kV network from the Latrobe Valley to Melbourne) and forcing the development of renewable electricity in locations that are further away from Victoria’s main load centre and will have a large part of their renewable energy wasted by spillage due to severe congestion on VNI West. This too will push prices up relative to what they otherwise would be,” the submission claims.
The pair also take aim at the overall design concept of the interconnector, which they say relies on a “single, heavily-loaded 500 kV transmission line for most of its proposed 500 kV backbone stretching 3,300 km from Tasmania to Townsville.”
This design makes it prone to being impacted by natural disasters, the authors claim – noting that according to AEMO’s own modelling, bushfire risk to transmission lines will increase almost 10-fold between now and 2050 as the climate changes. Such an occurrence would leave Victoria with blackouts and “extensive electricity rationing” until the damage is rectified, the authors say.
Finally, Mountain alleges the project concept relies on a 13 year old blueprint that has “long since been superseded.” 
“AEMO is stuck in the past, pursuing a redundant vision that suits its corporate interests,” Mountain says. “Under the guise of providing solutions for the urgent energy transition, AEMO has pushed for an unchecked monopoly. Energy ministers have, so far, caved-in to its demands.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/13/jolywood-claims-26-7-efficiency-for-n-type-topcon-solar-cell/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 13, 2023",Jolywood claims 26.7% efficiency for n-type TOPCon solar cell,"From pv magazine Global
Jolywood claims to have achieved a power conversion efficiency of 26.7% for an n-type M10 solar cell based on TOPCon technology.
The China Academy of Metrology and Science has certified the result, which Jolywood said currently represents a world record for an n-type TOPCon cell. It improves upon the company’s previous record of 26.1%, which was achieved in November 2022.
The Chinese solar module maker said it achieved the new results due to its independently developed Plasma Oxidation & Plasma Assisted Insitu-doping Deposition (POPAID) technology. POPAID reportedly overcomes issues with similar doped amorphous silicon technology.
“Through continuous technological innovation, Jolywood has successfully developed various cutting-edge technologies such as impurity extraction in silicon wafer body region, a local polysilicon layer, hydrogen content regulation of polysilicon film, new metal damage repair, and ultra-fine gate line printing,” the company said. “By adopting mass production equipment and materials in the production line, Jolywood has achieved a conversion efficiency of 26.7%, pointing out a clear technical direction for the future improvement of the mass production efficiency of the TOPCon cell.”
Jolywood recently commissioned a 1.5GW TOPCon solar cell factory in Taizhou, in China’s Zhejiang province.
“With this new manufacturing facility, our TOPCon solar cell production capacity has now reached 3.6GW,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
In October, the company presented a bifacial 700W TOPCon solar module at Intersolar in Munich, Germany. In January, it unveiled a 615W TOPCon product.
