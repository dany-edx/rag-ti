GMG said the JDA seeks to support the accelerated development of the clean-tech company’s graphene aluminium-ion battery technology for use in heavy mobile equipment and grid energy storage applications in the mining and mineral industry.
Rio Tinto will contribute technical and operational performance criteria and $6 million (USD 4 million) in exchange for preferential access rights.
GMG Chief Executive Officer Craig Nicol said the development agreement, which builds on an existing collaboration between the two companies, is effective immediately and is expected to last two years with payments spread over the term of the agreement.
“The collaboration with Rio Tinto on the applications of graphene aluminium-ion batteries is a key step for GMG,” Nicol said. “Together, with the existing technical and supply chain partnerships already established, this is another important step towards GMG’s goal to become a major global supplier of next-generation batteries as we continue to de-risk the commercial scale-up of this technology.”
The agreement aims to co-develop GMG’s graphene aluminium-ion battery pouch cell into an initial battery module proof of concept.
GMG said its technology, which sees an aluminium-ion battery paired with graphene electrodes, offers high energy densities and higher power densities than the lithium-ion technology that currently dominates the global energy storage market.

GMG Chair Guy Outen said the opportunity to work with Rio Tinto, which has previously said it will invest approximately $7.5 billion to help achieve its decarbonisation targets, including cutting carbon emissions by 50% by 2030, will greatly assist the development of the battery technology.
“We’ll now re-prioritise our energies to developing this form of battery which should further support progress towards our aim of a commercial, large-scale, highly competitive battery,” he said.
As well as providing finance for the project, Rio Tinto will seek to involve manufacturers of heavy vehicles and machinery to work with GMG and Rio Tinto to align the battery pack development with end-use requirements.
GMG said the project could deliver performance enhancements for Rio Tinto, including faster charging and longer-life batteries for heavy mobile equipment and grid energy storage, as well as supporting Rio Tinto’s decarbonisation ambitions.
“For Rio Tinto it’s a crucial time to partner with companies like GMG to accelerate battery technology and innovation,” Rio Tinto Chief Scientist Nigel Steward said. “We are looking forward to continuing our collaboration and leveraging our combined expertise and resources to develop a truly green battery that has the potential to improve the way we supply and store energy.”
GMG said on completion of the project it will retain ownership of the intellectual property of the graphene aluminium-ion battery pouch cell and battery pack while Rio Tinto will have the right to procure and use the batteries in its operations.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/18/international-graphite-lands-site-for-planned-battery-anode-plant/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 18, 2023",International Graphite lands site for planned battery anode plant,"International Graphite has selected the preferred site for its proposed Collie graphite battery anode material (BAM) manufacturing facility, signing a non-binding memorandum of understanding on a ‘strategically located’ 20-hectare site near Collie in Western Australia’s (WA) southwest.
The Perth-based company said it is negotiating a lease of up to 40 years on the privately owned site in the Coolangatta industrial precinct about five kilometres northeast of the Collie town centre. The lease comprises an initial 20-year period with an option for a second 20-year term.
International Graphite Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Andrew Worland said securing the Collie site was a significant milestone in the development of the plant which would process graphite, a key ingredient in the production of lithium-ion batteries.
“The land is cleared, well served by sealed roads and civil infrastructure, with ample space to accommodate our initial design and future expansion plans,” Worland said. “Most importantly, it is only metres from the existing power network which gives us the opportunity to purchase energy at the lowest possible transmission cost.”
In addition to being close to existing transmission infrastructure, Worland said the 20-hectare site has “sufficient area to consider installation of a solar facility” with access to cost competitive power a cornerstone of the company’s business plans.
The transaction has been franked by the federal government’s announcement that it will provide $4.7 million (USD 3.13 million) to International Graphite to support the project and follows the company’s release last month of its scoping study which highlighted the “outstanding” economics of developing its proposed BAM manufacturing facility.
International Graphite said the Collie facility has been designed in modular fashion so it can be implemented in stages with the company aiming to first produce uncoated periodised purified graphite (USPG). This first USPG facility would then be expanded to involve carbon coating, ultimately producing coated spheroidised purified graphite (CSPG).
The company anticipates its completed facility would be capable of producing up to 40,000 tonnes per year of graphite concentrates.

International Graphite’s scoping study was based on purchasing graphite concentrates from a third party but the company is ultimately planning to vertically integrate its business and use the output from its Springdale Graphite Project near Hopetoun, on WA’s south coast, to provide the feedstock for the Collie downstream processing plant.
The company plans to process its Springdale-sourced ore at its Collie processing facility, about 450 kilometres from the deposit. The procedure will allow it to transform the raw graphite into a battery grade material.
International Graphite has said it aims to have a definitive feasibility study for the Collie graphite BAM facility in the third quarter of 2024.
The project has received support from the federal and state governments with Australian Resources Minister Madeleine King on Thursday announcing it is one of 13 projects to share in almost $50 million in grants designed to accelerate the development of the country’s critical minerals sector.
King said the 13 projects to receive funding under the Critical Minerals Development Program grants include plans to produce key inputs to lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles, and to support supply chains for advanced manufacturing for aerospace, medical, energy and defence applications.
“The successful projects will create jobs and opportunities across regional Australia and help Australia realise its ambitions to be a clean-energy superpower,” she said. “The grants will support Australia’s new Critical Minerals Strategy, to be released shortly and which will outline how Australia can capture the significant opportunity of growing its critical minerals processing sector.
“Australia has remarkable potential to meet the increasing global demand for the critical minerals needed for clean energy technologies, such as electric vehicles and batteries, as the world moves to decarbonise.”
International Graphite’s plan to establish its processing facility at Collie continues the transition of the town which has been at the centre of the state’s energy generation for more than a century.
Collie, at the heart of the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) which delivers electricity to metropolitan Perth and into the Mid West, South West and Kalgoorlie-Goldfields regions, has powered WA since the 1880s with its two coal mines.
But with the state government having announced plans to exit coal-fired power by the end of the decade, the town has become the focal point for WA’s transition to renewables.
Last week state-owned energy utility Synergy announced it will build a battery energy storage system at Collie, which the state government said will be one of the biggest battery systems in the world. The 500 MW/2,000 MWh Collie battery is due to commence operations before the end of 2025 and comes as International Graphite also assesses the feasibility of establishing its own large-scale battery.
International Graphite said it also has a non-binding memorandum of understanding with Zen Energy which is assessing the feasibility of building a 200 MW, 600-800 MWh battery at Collie.
French renewable energy giant Neoen has also identified Collie as an ideal location, having already secured development approval to build a 1 GW/4 GWh big battery there. Neon said the project will include five individual 200 MW/800 MWh battery compounds with a total combined output of 1,000 MW/4,000 MWh. The project will be constructed in 200 MW/800 MWh stages with Neoen predicting the facility will be operational “by or before 2025.”

The Powering Australia Industry Growth Centre, which will join six existing centres in other priority areas, will offer advanced technology and skills development for businesses looking to commercialise locally manufactured renewable energy technologies and ideas.
Federal Industry Minister Ed Husic said it will also encourage connections between critical minerals producers and renewable technology manufacturers and provide a First Nations Advisor to build First Nations business management capabilities in the sector.
“We want an agile, industry-led approach to growing our renewable technology industry,” Husic said. “Industry growth centres are a proven way of delivering the sort of timely and targeted support to our renewable business leaders are calling for.”
“There’s $3 billion in the National Reconstruction Fund for the renewable and low-emissions energy industries. Today’s announcement will help maximise that investment.”
Husic said establishing the Powering Australia Industry Growth Centre delivers on the government’s election commitment for an industry-led approach to enhancing Australia’s renewable energy industries.
The minister said the new Industry Growth Centre will leverage the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund to amplify its impact on the Australian economy.
It also builds on the recently announced Net Zero Authority which has been established to coordinate Australia’s transition from fossil fuel production and associated industries to a renewables dominated economy.
The body, which will be legislated through parliament, will be tasked with coordinating Australia’s energy transition – from fossil-fuel-generated power to renewable alternatives – by providing advice to governments on policy and regulations, setting national plans and targets, and supporting regions and communities to attract and take advantage of new clean energy industries.
