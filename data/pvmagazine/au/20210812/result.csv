EPEC this week said a project team had headed to the Woolooga Solar Farm site west of Gympie, about 150 kilometres north of Brisbane, to begin construction of a 132 kV/33 kV substation which will connect the facility to the national grid.
The solar farm, being developed by the Australian renewables arm of British oil major BP, Lightsource bp Australia, is expected to generate 438,000 MWh of clean energy each year, enough to power about 71,000 homes.
The 176 MW solar farm is being built directly opposite the Lower Wonga substation on the Wide Bay Highway with government-owned utility Powerlink engaged to connect the facility to the grid.
Powerlink will also coordinate a feasibility study into the proposed Borumba Dam pumped hydro storage facility set to be developed about 80kms to the south of the Woolooga Solar Farm.
The state government has called for initial engineering and consulting services to deliver design and costings for the 1 GW project which would feature 24 hours of storage and would be Queensland’s largest pumped hydro project, with the potential to power up to 1.5 million homes.
Minister for Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen Mick de Brenni said the state government has committed $22 million for a detailed design and cost analysis of the project to support future decisions.

“Borumba hydro is an important project for Queensland as we move towards our 50% renewable energy target by 2030,” de Brenni said.
“Pumped hydro will play a key role in complementing solar and wind generation.
“We hope that Queensland-based businesses get involved in the tender process to deliver the relevant work packages.”
Powerlink chief executive Paul Simshauser said the tender process would ensure the right expertise is secured on the project at the 46,000 megalitre Borumba Dam.
“Together with the Queensland government, we will soon commence engagement with a range of stakeholders,” he said.
“Borumba Dam has the potential to be one of the state’s largest infrastructure projects, so we need to get the right technical advice now in delivering the design and cost analysis.”
De Brenni said the need for the project had become more pressing following the recent failure of the coal-fired Callide C power station, which was taken offline following an explosion at the plant.

The incident caused chaos in Queensland’s electricity system, leaving an estimated 500,000 customers without power for several hours.
“The benefits of having pumped hydro as part of our diversified energy mix was proven when Callide Power Station went offline,” de Brenni said.
“Pumped hydro storage is flexible, reliable, and complements renewable energy generation such as solar and wind. That’s why Queensland needs more of it.”
The call for tenders for the Borumba Dam project is the latest in a flurry of pumped hydro activity.
The state government last month announced a $14 million overhaul of the 570 MW Wivenhoe Pumped Storage Hydroelectric Power Station, while GE Renewable Energy revealed in January it had signed an agreement with Australian-based consortium BE Power to co-develop the 400 MW Big T pumped hydro storage project at Cressbrook Dam near Toowoomba.
Elsewhere, Genex Power’s 250 MW Kidston Pumped Hydro Storage Project in the state’s far north is also progressing.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/12/csiro-looks-to-space-to-test-next-gen-solar-cell-technology/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 12, 2021",CSIRO looks to space to test next gen solar cell technology,"Australia’s national science agency, the CSIRO, will team with Adelaide-based in-space transportation provider Space Machines Company (SMC) to test its next generation solar PV cell technology.
The CSIRO will explore the potential of its perovskite-based next gen solar cells on SMC’s spacecraft Optimus-1, due to be launched next year by Gold Coast rocket company Gilmour Space Technologies.
Flexible thin-film solar is not a new concept but it has so far remained a niche area, with efficiencies and device lifetimes lagging those achieved in silicon PV or thin films deposited on glass but the CSIRO is pursuing the development of printable solar cells that are lightweight, thin and semi-transparent.
The science agency has been researching both organic PV (OPV) and perovskite solar cells, which are made from a mix of organic and inorganic materials rather than traditional silicon solar cells.
Printable ‘solar inks’ are deposited onto flexible plastic films that can then be connected to make solar panels of significant size.
The CSIRO claims to have achieved efficiencies of greater than 19% on small-scale devices while the pilot-scale, roll-to-roll printing lines have successfully fabricated 30-centimetre-wide flexible solar modules that can be cut to length. The weight and flexibility of the panels make then ideal for places where traditional solar panels are too heavy or bulky.
CSIRO principal research scientist Mei Gao said the collaboration with SMC will be the first time the agency’s printable solar cells have been tested in space and expects the results to provide benefits for more traditional applications.
“We will collect data from this mission to explore new applications of our technology,” she said.
“Solar films are about making solar energy more accessible, on earth and in space.”

While the project will aid the continued development of flexible and lightweight solar PV cells, it will also help develop Australia’s in-space solar technology which is considered crucial for the growth of the country’s space industry.
Solar is the primary energy source in space, but SMC co-founder and chief executive Rajat Kulshrestha said space-graded rigid and foldable solar panels, the main alternatives today, are heavy and extremely expensive.
While printable solar cells have been less efficient than the rigid versions, in the future they could be an order of magnitude cheaper than traditional space-grade solar cells and exceptionally volume efficient.
While the initial test will use static printed cells that are fixed to the space craft’s surface, the CSIRO technology will be deployed alongside the more traditional solar panels so that their relative performance can be assessed.
“This is a fantastic example of collaboration between a privately funded space company and a government agency to develop the Australian sovereign capability in space,” Kulshrestha said.
“We are flying traditional [solar panels], but we will be taking CSIRO panels as payloads to ensure that we can test them and actually also get a benchmark across existing performance compared to traditional solar panels. I think this will be great telemetry to get, to be able to then go to the next step and really start to work more closely in the future with CSIRO.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/12/chasing-the-sun-tax-free/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",,"AUGUST 12, 2021",Chasing the sun — tax-free!,"This is just part of a package of reforms designed to fully integrate distributed energy resources into the energy market rules for the first time—but it is the part that has grabbed most of the media attention up till now.
There was an overwhelmingly positive response a month ago to the draft reform package from nearly 2,000 respondents to a survey conducted by Newgate Research for Energy Consumers Australia. 
This was despite claims that ‘’it’s a tax on the sun!’’ which triggered a rash of alarmist headlines, a wave of fear and anger among solar owners across the country, and a chorus of industry experts expressing their concern about the potential impact on the rate of new installations.
As one of the original rule change proponents, the Total Environment Centre (TEC) understands the concerns of those stakeholders and did some deep thinking.  After all, the boom in rooftop solar made possible by the Renewable Energy Target has been the one shining light in the slough of despond that has been climate and energy policy in Australia over the last two decades. 
In the end, we decided to continue supporting the rule change – but with some important amendments, which we’ll get to.
Doing nothing was never an option. New solar owners are increasingly being subjected to lower export limits as the grid’s capacity to absorb ever more solar energy shrinks in the middle of the day.  And there were increasing calls for people who cannot install solar and batteries not to be forced to subsidise the network needs of those that do.
But is it really a tax on the sun? A tax is “a compulsory contribution to state revenue, levied by the government on workers’ income and business profits, or added to the cost of some goods, services, and transactions.”
Putting aside the fact that solar tariffs would have nothing to do with government revenue, let’s focus on the word compulsory.
This may have been a legitimate concern with the draft rule a few months ago, but TEC and our partner ACOSS recommended a change which thankfully the AEMC has adopted. Now, for at least the next 20 years, no solar owner will be forced onto an export tariff which includes charges or a levy for exports. (The quid pro quo is that instead they may face a static export limit, but that is the current situation anyway.)
The other way it is not a blanket and compulsory levy is that, under the new rules, any distribution network which is considering introducing export tariffs would need to propose a variety of tariff options to its customers in the five yearly revenue determination process, and must also convince the regulator that it has customer support for its preferred options.
Networks would need to offer a choice of tariffs – most likely a basic service for free, or a higher level of service in return for unlimited exports most of the time but a network levy at some times (probably in the middle of sunny days in autumn and spring, when demand is low but solar output is high). That is, solar owners would have the choice of opting in to an export tariff with charges if they think it would be in their interest.
The basic service must include a guaranteed minimal level of export. Networks can no longer impose a zero export limit—something that thousands of solar owners have been forced to accept in recent years. This is another major amendment which TEC and ACOSS proposed, and which the AEMC has adopted in the final rule.
The flip side of networks charging to export at some times is that they would need to reward exports at other times – probably during the evening demand peak. Battery owners are the obvious, but not the only, winners here. Solar owners could also make money out of it if they can run more appliances during the day, face their panels east or west instead of north, or charge an electric car when the sun is shining.
Networks could only introduce export tariffs for some customers if they could prove that any money they want to spend on new infrastructure to accommodate more solar and battery exports would not also benefit other consumers who don’t have this gear (this is called the “net market benefit test”). If it does benefit everyone, they can recover the costs from everyone. Historically, this has been the case, but in future it is less certain.
The third major change between the draft and the final rules is the timing of implementation. Networks can begin to introduce export tariffs on a gradual basis beginning in 2025, so nothing will change before then. Guaranteed free options will apply up until 2041—long after any system installed recently or in the near future would have paid for itself.
Everyone who wants to will get a chance to have a say in the detailed tariff designs over the next few years. The result will be that solar on household roofs, along with batteries and electric cars, will be better integrated into our future energy needs.
It’s voluntary.  You can make money from it.  And you (or groups advocating on your behalf) need to support the fine print for it to happen.
Does this still sound like a big, bad, tax on the sun?

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/12/new-rules-revealed-as-aemc-aims-to-transform-network-into-two-way-super-highway/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 12, 2021",New rules revealed as AEMC aims to transform network into ‘two-way super-highway’,"The Australian Energy Market Commission (AMEC) has released its final rule determination, a reforms package which aims to provide for the integration of rapidly increasing levels of distributed rooftop solar PV into the National Electricity Market (NEM) and support the growth of batteries and electric vehicles (EVs).
“It’s all about setting us up for the grid of the future,” AEMC chair Anna Collyer told pv magazine.
“We’ve got 2.8 million households with solar panels now, we’re looking at that doubling in the next 10 years. We’re also looking at the number of household batteries and electric vehicles increasing as that technology improves and costs come down.
“The grid is just not set up to deal with these two-way flows that we expect to see happening more and more.”
The final reforms package was officially unveiled by the energy market rule maker on Thursday.
The document includes a raft of changes including updates to the regulatory framework to recognise that distribution services are two-way and include export services, and that the current rules relating to distribution services apply to export services.
Distributed network service providers (DNSPs) will have clear obligations to support energy flowing both ways and they will now be accountable for getting their businesses “solar and battery friendly”.
The changes include the introduction of a performance framework and mandatory reporting on how the network companies are delivering on expectations to enable more solar with the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) to have oversight.
The final package also prohibits the network companies’ ability to put blanket bans on customers exporting solar energy back to the grid but Collyer conceded there may be some limited circumstances, subject to regulatory approval, where that remains necessary for security and reliability.
Likely to be the most controversial component of the reform package is the allowing for DNSPs to charge for export services.
The change gives individual network service providers the option to develop two-way pricing that rewards owners of DER for exporting power to the grid when extra energy is needed, and charging them a fee for exporting at times when the system is already well served.
Collyer said the reforms are a long-term sustainable plan to have more customers benefit from solar, put downward pressure on electricity prices and help decarbonise the energy sector faster.
“These new measures to drive smart solar are fundamental to enabling a modern electricity grid that delivers out to 2030 and beyond,” she said.
“They represent a profound change to the way poles and wires businesses must think about how they manage their network and turn the current one-way street delivering power to people’s homes into two-way super-highway where energy flows in both directions.
“Power network companies will need to deliver services to support solar – and they’ll be judged on their performance on how much solar exports they allow into the grid.”

The changes to the National Electricity Rules come with Australia’s power system undergoing a rapid transformation. The nation has the fastest rate of solar uptake in the world with almost one in four Australian homes possessing rooftop solar and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) predicts that within the next decade half of all consumers in the NEM will be using some form of DER.
By 2050, rooftop solar and other types of DER will contribute more than 45% of Australia’s electricity supply and the AEMC has warned that without action, the grid will be unable to handle the volume of solar forecast to double over the next decade.
Collyer said the rule changes aim to move solar around to when it’s most needed so solar owners can get more from their panels and more solar can get onto the grid.
“The fundamental change we’re making here is to impose an obligation on networks to provide an export service that will be subject to the same regulatory scrutiny as their current traditional service so it really is completely shifting what it is we want distribution networks to do so that we can ensure customers get the benefit of all these assets that they invest in now and in the future,” she said.
“We don’t want to see solar going to waste. That costs everyone more because less cheap renewable energy gets into the system.”
The two-way pricing mechanism attracted widespread criticism during the consultation phase with opponents arguing that it is an effective “solar tax” on households and will disincentivise solar.
Advocates however claim the export charges are necessary to help fund much-needed upgrades to electricity networks.

While the changes are sure to spark renewed debate, AEMC chief executive Benn Barr said the pricing mechanism is not mandatory and networks will have to offer a free basic service alongside any paid solar export plans, and the AER will need to sign off on all network plans as being in the long-term consumer interest.
Network companies will be obliged to offer a free service up until at least 2041. The changes allowing energy networks to charge households for exporting surplus solar energy to the grid will apply from July 2025.
The AEMC said each network will retain the ability to develop its own incentives because each has a different customer mix level of solar penetration and congestion, and different government preferences to consider.
“This is about getting ahead of the curve and preparing the grid for change that is happening now and only going to accelerate over the next 10 years,” Barr said.
“Getting this right means adapting the grid to handle more solar in a smart way that keeps costs down, keeps significant financial benefits for those who choose to go solar and saves money on electricity bills for those who don’t or can’t. Getting it wrong means less clean energy in the system and existing and future solar and battery customers miss out.”
AER chair Clare Savage welcomed the rule change as a balanced set of reforms that are in the long-term interests of energy consumers.
Savage said the AER will soon commence a consultation process on developing the Export Tariff Guideline, starting with publishing an Issues Paper in September, with the aim to publish a draft guideline for community feedback in early 2022.
“For the household rooftop solar investors out there, and network companies, we want you to know that we will work with you to develop a set of guidelines that encourage network investment that supports the national grid, the environment, and is good news for retail energy bills,” she said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/12/bp-study-confirms-australias-green-hydrogen-export-potential-and-calls-for-carbon-price/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"AUGUST 12, 2021","bp study confirms Australia’s green hydrogen export potential, and calls for carbon price","bp Australia has concluded its $4.42 million “Renewable Hydrogen and Ammonia Feasibility Study” (the Study), supported by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Lightsource bp and GHD Advisory, confirming that “production of green hydrogen and ammonia using renewable energy is technically feasible at scale in Australia”, and identified Western Australia (WA) as the ideal position for this production. 
The technical feasibility of export-scale green hydrogen and ammonia production in Western Australia is due to WA’s “vast potential solar and wind resources, existing infrastructure and proximity to large, long-term markets.” 
However, the Study, which evaluated the techno-economic potential of pilot and commercial-scale green production plants as part of Project GERI (Geraldton Export-Scale Renewable Investment) in Geraldton, WA, also found that significant infrastructural investment in ports, water and electricity networks and distribution would be necessary for the development of a green hydrogen export industry. 
What is more, the markets of hydrogen and ammonia need development themselves, particularly general hydrogen fuel use as it still requires significant scale before it can be commercially viable. Ammonia, of course, is already traded globally at scale. 

Lightsource bp completed modelling based on both the pilot scale (4,000 tonnes of hydrogen making up to 20,000 tonnes of ammonia), and commercial scale (200,000 tonnes of hydrogen making up to 1 million tonnes of ammonia), generated by a mix of solar and wind with “some battery support”. 
For perspective, the pilot scale supposed a load requirement of 35.4 MW of renewable energy provided by a power purchase agreement (PPA). And the commercial scale plant supposed load requirements of 1370 MW through wind and solar capacity of 2000 MW each, “resulting in 77% electrolyser capacity utilisation. This would mean the plant would be ‘turned down’ reasonably regularly.” 
Frédéric Baudry, president, bp Australia and SVP fuels & low carbon solutions, Asia Pacific, said in a statement that “this study confirms the potential for scaled-up green hydrogen in Western Australia. This looks particularly promising in the mid-west of WA, which has existing infrastructure, access to land and abundant renewable energy resources such as wind and solar.” 
“Importantly,” continued Baudry, “our study also confirmed strong demand from potential customers in the hard-to-abate sectors, and for both local and export markets. This has the potential to position Australia as a regional powerhouse of the energy transition.” 
bp has a role to play 
Unlike Australia itself, bp has committed itself to becoming a net zero company by 2050 or sooner. And the company now views Project GERI as a key pathway to that goal with the help of its joint venture Lightsource bp, which would supply the requisite renewable energy. bp plans to develop around 50 GW of renewable energy in order to capture a 10% market share in the core hydrogen markets. 
However, the Study stresses that “a thriving Australian hydrogen industry is not guaranteed.” Noting that “industry development depends on the level of government support, policy endorsement and infrastructure development.” 
Of course, while the federal government’s energy agnosticism when it comes to developing the hydrogen industry is controversial, it should also be stated that bp is a company which has profited off the fossil fuels that cause global warming. bp should, therefore, be paying for the development of green hydrogen. The government’s role is to make development easy for bp, not to cover the costs of developing an industry that bp will also go on to profit from. 
Nevertheless, it can’t be said bp is shying away from the costs of this transition. Indeed, the Study declares: “The absence of a carbon price or emissions cap is a key barrier to attracting investment in renewable technologies such as hydrogen.” 
All about that money
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said bp’s analysis “of the economic opportunity presented by renewable hydrogen will help Australia determine how it can be scaled-up to satisfy future demand. The report represents a vital building block in our pathway to creating a fully integrated renewable hydrogen supply chain, allowing Australia to become leaders in a future export industry.” 
Jason Fonti, origination and value chain leader at GDH Advisory, pointed out that “the magic figure is producing hydrogen below $2 per kilo and the pathway to get there is becoming clearer. The study has highlighted that, through innovation, talent, commitment and collaboration, Western Australia can become one of the major exporters of hydrogen in the global market.”
WA all the way 
The study identified WA’s Mid-West Region as having the real global advantage in potential for green hydrogen production, but didn’t ignore the Pilbara, where the 26 GW Asian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) is slated for construction (pending further environmental review), nor the Goldfields-Esperance region, where the AREH’s proponents recently proposed a 50 GW Western Green Energy Hub. 
The Study concluded that “a finite window of opportunity is open to fully develop a hydrogen and ammonia industry in Australia…investment over the next three to five years and supportive government policy will be pivotal to achieve industry momentum…Progress will need strong corporate and government resolve and action, but the potential payoffs are momentous.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/12/indian-researchers-increase-hydrogen-yield-three-fold-while-using-less-electricity/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,INDIA,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"AUGUST 12, 2021",Indian researchers increase hydrogen yield three-fold while using less electricity,"From pv magazine India
The research team, led by Professor C. Subramaniam, demonstrated that a water electrolysis system that produced 1 ml of hydrogen gas, required 19% lower energy to produce 3 ml of hydrogen in the same time when electrolysis was done in the presence of an external magnetic field. The team achieved this by synergistically coupling the electric and magnetic fields at the catalytic site. 
Manipulating heterogeneous electrified interfaces with an external magnetic field (Hext) explicitly mandates the constant presence of Hext for achieving magnetoelectrocatalytic kinetic enhancements. The researchers demonstrated the highest kinetic enhancement of 650% in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), without the mandatory presence of Hext. 
The key to this effect is the electrocatalytic (carbon-cobalt oxide catalyst) interface that does not require the constant presence of any external magnetic field and can sustain the magnetisation for prolonged time periods. The cobalt-oxide-based catalyst developed by the researchers also provides a cost advantage over platinum (Pt)-based catalysts. 
Speaking to pv magazine, Prof. C. Subramaniam said, “There are numerous attempts to fabricate the best electrocatalyst for water splitting at the low material cost, low energy penalty without compromising on the rate of hydrogen generation. Pt-group-based catalysts are the best known in this direction. However, the prohibitive cost of the catalyst is a huge challenge for commercialisation. This led to developing earth-abundant cobalt oxide as catalysts. The cobalt-oxide (Co3O4) nanocubes were dispersed on nanostructured carbon florets as supports to make the final catalyst.”
“Given the kinetics of water splitting is slow with these catalysts, we developed an innovative solution of coupling an external magnetic field to the electrolytic process.” 
With this approach, the researchers were able to obtain a 650% increase in current density, 19% lowering of energy required, and a three-fold increase in volumetric hydrogen production rate. 
The magnitude of the enhancements achieved is unparalleled. And the intermittent magnetic field required is similar to what a fridge magnet can provide. 
“This route can be directly adopted in existing electrolysers without any change in design or mode of operation and one-time exposure of magnetic field for 10 minutes is enough to achieve the high rate of hydrogen production for over 45 minutes,” according to the researchers. 
“The intermittent use of an external magnetic field provides a new direction for achieving energy-efficient hydrogen generation. Other catalysts can also be explored for this purpose,” said Prof. Subramaniam. “A basic electrolyser cell of 0.5 nm3/h capacity can be immediately upgraded to a 1.5 nm3/h capacity by replacing the catalysts and supplying the magnetic field,” added Jayeeta Saha and Ranadeb Ball, project researchers and students at IIT Bombay.  
Having shown that the method is not very complicated either, the team is now working with an industrial partner to ensure its successful commercialisation. 
The research findings are published in Sustainable Chem. Eng Journal of American Chemical Society, 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/12/energy-storage-with-recycled-batteries-from-brazil/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,BRAZIL",PV MAGAZINE,"AUGUST 12, 2021",Energy storage with recycled batteries from Brazil,"From pv magazine Brazil
Brazil-based Energy Source is betting on two new business models to boost its revenue in 2021: storage services with reused batteries and the recycling of batteries that have already completed their second life cycles, including the recovery of metals such as cobalt.
The company expects to conclude a financing round by October that will support its “battery-as-a-service” (BaaS) model. The expectation is to raise BRL 12 million ($2.3 million) from existing partners and investors.
“The manufacture of new batteries from batteries that have already gone through a first life cycle started in 2017, and the recycling of batteries at the end of the second cycle began in December 2020,” Energy Source CEO David Noronha told pv magazine.
Up until this year, Energy Source had mainly been selling its products through a partnership with Brazil’s largest PV product distributor, Aldo Solar, which also sells and distributes reused batteries. The idea now is to expand the relationship with end customers, in order to sell the batteries but also to sell storage services, which could include battery replacement. So far, the company has traded 6.5 MWh of second-life batteries and 1.4 MWh of new batteries. The expectation is to reach 10 MWh per month, on average, from 2022.
The company aims to serve the energy backup market, off-grid systems, and hybrid energy systems.
“The investment round is also to make this new commercial model for the company viable,” said Noronha.
To also serve the energy management market, the company has developed a battery monitoring system that can be integrated with technologies other than lithium, including lead-acid batteries.
The software is part of the BaaS model and enables end-to-end monitoring, maintenance, failure prevention, and battery behaviour prediction functions.
“In the end, what we intend is to guarantee the delivery of the contracted energy, that it is available when needed,” said Noronha.
Energy Source is also ramping up its recycling line for batteries that have already passed through their second life cycle at its plant in São João da Boa Vista, in the state of Sao Paulo. It began running a pilot line in December 2020.
So far this year, the recycling plant has already processed 50 tons of batteries. By the end of the year, there will be 300 tons.
“(They) are no longer discarded and are returning to the market as metals used by the industry, such as cobalt and nickel,” said Noronha.
The process, which is carbon neutral, is designed to appeal to people and companies that are interested in the proper disposal of batteries. Automakers Renault and BMW are already Energy Source partners.
The recycling of batteries and the recovery of metals is conducted in two stages, both without associated emissions, as they do not involve the burning of materials. The first stage is carried out at the Energy Source plant itself. It is an electrochemical-mechanical process that produces the so-called “black mass,” which consists of large amounts of lithium, manganese, cobalt and nickel metals. The black mass is then sent to InCasa, a company based in Joinville, which is also located in Sao Paulo, for the second stage. This phase involves the separation and refinement of metals through a hydrometallurgical process. Under this recycling model, the company becomes eligible to issue carbon credits.
This year, it started a certification process led by ACV Brasil, with completion scheduled by 2022. The estimate of preliminary studies is that each ton recycled is equivalent to 5 tons of carbon credits.
“One of our main goals currently has been to capture the batteries,” said Noronha. The batteries collected by Energy Source mainly come from electronics, as well as products such as phones, drones, electric vehicles, electric bicycles, and electric scooters.
The recycled batteries are mainly traded with waste managers, but also with equipment manufacturers. Noronha said partnerships with disposal companies can be designed in different ways.
“Among other variables, it depends on the composition of the batteries, the amount of lithium, iron, phosphate. Batteries with higher concentrations of cobalt tend to be worth more,” he added.
