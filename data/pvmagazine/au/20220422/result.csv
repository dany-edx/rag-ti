Renewables, she said, are nowhere near active enough in the lobbying space. Ultimately this silence has allowed fossil fuel industries continue their domination here and has lent polluting industries a greater voice and influence over politics in this country.
Her message was if Australia is to avert climate catastrophe, renewable industries will need to get louder, fast.
The MP pointed to online resource Influencemap.org, a thinktank providing data on business impacts relating to the climate crisis. The thinktank found during the pandemic the oil and gas sector dominated Australia climate-related policy battles.
It said fossil fuel industries were “more than twice as likely” to succeed based on its detailed assessments on “quick wins” when it came to policy.
While much of the fault for Australia’s climate inaction does fall on the political class, Steggall said, the renewables sector also needs to take responsibility for advocating for itself and strengthening its political influence.

Her message followed an address from Admiral Chris Barrie, who served as Chief of the Australian Defence Force from 1998 to 2002. Since then, Admiral Barrie has been active in tracking climate risks to Australia.
He described climate change as the greatest threat to the security of Australia.
Alarmingly, he categorised the country’s preparedness on that front as “lacking,” saying the country has not dealt adequately with “any challenge of significance” in recent years.
Unlike nuclear war, which he sees as another major threat – albeit one in which power is concentrated in the hands of a few, climate action “rests in the hands of us all,” he said.
He described the upcoming election as the “most important” election in his lifetime. While he criticised the federal government’s failure to act, he took a broad view on the responsibility to avert catastrophe, saying that if Australia fails, there is “no one to blame but ourselves.”

Today 91% of the fuel Australia uses for transport is imported. “We do not have fuel security,” Zali Steggall, the Independent Member of Parliament for Warringah said yesterday at the emergency summit held by the Smart Energy Council in Sydney, pointing out national fuel reserves are pitiful.
There was uniform consensus about Australia’s vulnerability among attendees, which also included Admiral Chris Barrie, former Chief of the Australian Defence Force; Cheryl Durrant, Climate Energy Strategist and executive member of the Australian Security Leaders Climate Group; Behyad Jefari, CEO of the Electric Vehicle Council; Richie Merzian, Director of the Energy and Climate program at thinktank the Australia Institute; as well as many more specialists. Given this, the event concluded by drawing up a shortlist of enactable solutions. Below is what the assembly arrived at.
Bella Peacock/pv magazine
Essentially a standard imposed on car manufacturers, Australia has resisted bringing in vehicle fuel efficiency standards which have long been commonplace among our peers. In fact, in the developed world only Australia and Russia remain without the standards that cover 80% of the world.
The standards would put a monetary impetus on vehicle manufacturers to ensure the cars they import emit less pollution and have better fuel technology and efficiencies, EV Council CEO Behyad Jefari said.
The lack of these standards, he added, has made Australia “a dumping ground for less efficient vehicles,” giving carmakers a market for the models deemed unfit overseas.
Vehicle emissions standards were posited as one of the top solutions because, importantly, they would not cost the government nor citizens money to introduce and there is already a well established international framework in place which could be enacted immediately. 

Be that as it may, Steggall told the event that when she raised the issue with the Federal Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor, “I got an answer that this would not be addressed until 2027.”
Independent candidate for North Sydney Kylea Tink committed to introducing a private members bill for vehicle emissions standards in Australia, should she be elected next month.
Tink said the Morrison government had been looking into vehicle standards back in 2016, but had for reasons unknown opted not to implement them.
Jefari estimated the introduction of such standards would save Australian motorists between $500 – $660 annually, and would save the economy $30 billion currently flowing overseas to pay for fuel. The standards would also help to reduce annual emissions by 22 million tonnes, he added.
Electric vehicles (EV) are the most obvious way to shift Australia’s fuel reliance as they make petrol and diesel redundant. There are, however, numerous issues impacting their uptake, which we will discuss shortly.

In the meantime, it’s noteworthy that over 70% of cars purchased in Australia are from the used car market. Given that, government fleets take on a new importance as a tool for bringing electric vehicles into that second hand market.
If all levels of government, from local, state and federal were mandated to purchase electric vehicles in future, it would not only stimulate the construction of more public charging points by growing EV penetration, but would eventually give middle income Australians access to the technology.
Considered another “easy win” because of its no cost nature, setting and legislating proper short-and medium-term targets for emissions and EV sales would force governments to build policies to stimulate the decarbonisation of transport. 
Importantly, as Jefari pointed out, there is already a huge appetite for EVs in Australia – but many people simply can’t get their hands on them.
He claimed that for every EV model imported into Australia, demand is between 10 to 20 times greater, with batches selling out within hours of being made available online. Waitlists for some models are as great as 15,000 for cars bring brought in 500 at a time, he added.
International Energy Agency (IEA)
So the problem is not that Australian don’t want EVs, it’s that the current landscape in Australia hasn’t made them accessible.
The thinking is that by setting targets, it would force policymakers to rectify this. While this shouldn’t technically be difficult (given most developed countries have trodden the path before us), it is a duty for which there seems little political will federally.
Helping Australians become less dependant on private vehicles is perhaps one of the most impactful sustainability pathways. Giving Australians, who have historically been extremely reliant on personal vehicles, access to better public transport and better bicycle and footpaths is a fairly obviously means to cut emissions from transport – though this is more suitable for urban cities than regional communities.
As Admiral Chris Barrie pointed out, Australia’s per capita energy consumption in 2022 is forecast to be 10,071 kWh. For our neighbour Indonesia that number sits at just 812kWh.
Behaviour and how Australians consume energy, the admiral noted, must be addressed.

Pretty self explanatory, removing additional taxes would accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles by making them cheaper. 
Again, self explanatory but a key component here, it was noted, is messaging.
EVs need to be sold as “fuelled on Australian sunshine,” John Grimes, CEO of the Smart Energy Council said. With Australia’s world leading solar penetration, it is entirely feasible that instead of running on imported fuel, our vehicles could be powered by the wind and solar generated here onshore.
This hook could be a key selling point for the technology, making the subsidisation of fossil fuels even less sensical. 
ANU Solar Racing
Think Renewable Energy Target (RET), but for storage. Introduced by the Howard government back in 2001, Australia’s RET has been hailed as a driving force behind the country’s staggering solar uptake.
Since the core element of EVs is their battery, introducing a storage target would also stimulate the EV market. Moreover, given that EV batteries have larger capacities than most household batteries and their vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities are increasingly being recognised, such a policy could have multiple benefits. For instance, it could help smooth our grids, which are rapidly becoming overloaded with solar power during daylight hours.

Moreover, Allegra Spender, CEO of the Australian Business and Community Network and independent candidate for the Sydney electorate of Wentworth, says such targets – not only for storage, but decarbonisation generally – would help the business and corporate world understand Australia’s direction and move toward it. The current disparity between ambitious state goals and federal inaction has created uncertainty and ultimately slowed corporate initiatives, it was said.
Five Australian refineries have closed in the last decade leaving only two Australian refineries in operation today, Australia Institute’s Richie Merzian said. This is a major reason why Australia’s reliance on fuel imports has grown in recent years, the Australia Institute report ‘Over a Barrel’ released on Thursday noted.
The repurposing of these sites is something pv magazine Australia  reported on last year when global infrastructure developer AECOM examined all 58 petroleum fuel refineries and storage & import terminals in Australia and New Zealand to assess their capacity to be repurposed for new renewable industries.
It found many had significant potential, including seven ‘unicorn sites’ which AECOM described as uniquely flexible and therefore especially valuable.
Image: Exxonmobil
These sites would be ideal locations to develop hydrogen industries and renewable future fuels, according to both AECOM and event attendees. 
As mining shifts away from fossil fuels and towards critical minerals needed for batteries, workforces will need to be retrained and redeployed. Australia is already one of the world’s leading exporters of battery raw materials but the country does very little onshore processing and refining, and virtually no manufacturing.
This is something government and industry is trying to kickstart, and the coordinated reskilling and ultimate redeployment of workforces will prove critical to this vision being realised.
Image: Wollongong City Council
It isn’t only batteries which hold new industry potential, but also hydrogen. Given many of the country’s hydrogen hubs are being proposed in coal regions, an obvious choice due to their preexisting infrastructure, a more concerted start to the reskilling process would aid this transition and build future industry, attendees suggested. 
This pertinent line was thrown out in the event’s closing discussion, and was a sentiment shared by many in the room. 
The 77-year-old Admiral Chris Barrie called next month’s election the “most important” in his lifetime. He criticised the Coalition’s near decade in power as being characterised by “squandered opportunities” in terms of climate action and resilience.
It was agreed that Australia won’t be able to plug its massive fuel vulnerability without building scaffolding on which decarbonisation can hang.

The 50/50 partnership will see the pair construct multiple grid-scale solar projects from which Contact will purchase the solar electricity via a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA). 
Contact CEO Mike Fuge said the joint venture aligned with Contact’s decarbonisation strategy. “Our strategy lays out a path for Contact to decarbonise New Zealand, and a critical aspect of this is our commitment to help meet the massive, anticipated demand for renewable electricity.” 
“We’re very pleased to be joining forces with Lightsource bp” Fuge continued, “their team has deep solar development expertise and a hugely impressive track record.” 
Lightsource bp’s Australia and New Zealand Country Manager Adam Pegg said the company was excited to announce its entry into the New Zealand market through this exclusive partnership. 
“Grid-scale solar generation is a natural fit for New Zealand’s current generation mix and this partnership sees an experienced and highly-regarded New Zealand generator and retailer join forces with our global solar expertise to create cost=competitive and reliable solar power.” 
The entry into its 18th market is part of Lightsource bp’s ambition to develop 25 GW of global solar power projects by 2025. Pegg described this partnership as a step in that journey. 
“Our solar farms will create significant jobs and investment into regional New Zealand communities and businesses,” continued Fuge. “The technology around grid-scale solar generation has improved significantly and we’re looking forward to bringing these development opportunities to life with the Lightsource bp team.” 
The announcement comes in the same week as senior Google executive Urs Hölzle-backed Helios Energy committed to grid-scale solar developments in New Zealand. 
Contact and Lightsource bp said they expected to announce details of their first potential development site in coming months, and plan to begin electricity generation by 2024. 
New Zealand’s biggest solar array is currently under construction. The 220-hectare solar array capable of generating 150 MW of solar energy is to be situated adjacent to the runways of Christchurch Airport and known as Kōwhai Park. 
This week also saw Lightsource bp Australia (LBPA) announce plans for a 400 MW(DC) solar farm and co-located battery energy storage system (BESS) in Gundary, 13 kilometres south of Goulburn, New South Wales, Australia.

In a statement, Helios said its developments would lower energy prices and cut carbon emissions. Helios director, Jason McDonald, said the company brings approximately 2 GW of renewable energy project experience (including over 50 utility solar projects up to 250 MW) to the New Zealand market.
McDonald said the company’s pipeline now meant it could no longer keep quiet, that it was the right time to “introduce ourselves.”
“We expect to be making site development announcements and resource consent applications over the coming months. We will also be looking to engage on regulatory settings that can support solar developments right across the country,” said McDonald.
The announcement comes in the same week as Lightsource bp signed a 50/50 partnership with New Zealand energy retailer Contact Energy. The pair also committing to pursue large-scale solar developments in New Zealand, the electricity from which Contact Energy would purchase through power purchase agreements (PPAs).
McDonald said it was encouraging that new entrants were entering the energy market in New Zealand and challenging established players, but development experience is vital.
“While solar is an incredible opportunity to generate large volumes of clean, renewable energy,” McDonald continued, “it needs to be done at genuine scale. Additionally, competitively financing large projects can be challenging, and responsible solar development requires long-term commitment to community partnerships.”

McDonald said Helios is proud to have one of the world’s leading renewable energy strategists as an investor, namely Google’s Urs Hölzle, who made a private investment of Series A capital in Helios and its solar development pipeline in New Zealand.
Hölzle is one of the leading forces inside Google for its global 24/7 carbon-free by 2030 commitment. 24/7 matching quantifies energy usage by the hour rather than annually and represents the next stage of emissions reduction and grid cleaning.

Japanese electronics manufacturer Panasonic has commissioned a pilot hydrogen plant combining photovoltaics with storage and fuel cells at its fuel cell factory in Kusatsu, Shiga Prefecture, in central Japan.
The system has a power output of 1.07 MW, with 570 kW are provided by the solar array and 495 kW by Panasonic’s own fuel cell systems. It also relies on lithium-ion batteries with a combined storage capacity of 1.1 MWh. The Kusatsu site has a peak demand of around 680 kW and an annual power demand of around 2.7 GWh.
The pilot facility occupies a surface of around 6,000 square meters. It is purportedly the world’s first attempt to create a factory powered by 100% renewables through the full-scale use of hydrogen.
“Through this demonstrator, we will acquire know-how and data related to energy management, including the operation of pure hydrogen fuel cells,” the manufacturer said. “The generated power will cover all the electricity needed by the manufacturing department of the fuel cell factory in the Kusatsu base.”
The facility was built with 99 Panasonic H2 Kibou fuel cell systems with capacities of 5 kW each. The system works with pure hydrogen at a density of more than 99.97%, and achieves electrical efficiency of 56%. It measures 834 mm × 417 mm × 1,766 mm and weighs 205 kg, including the design panel.
The fuel cell generator can be used with an operating temperature between -10 C and 40 C, at altitudes not exceeding 500 meters. During power outages, it is able to generate electricity and to use up to 2.5 kW of its capacity for at least 120 hours.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/22/india-vies-to-become-global-lithium-battery-recycling-hub/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"APRIL 22, 2022",India vies to become global lithium battery recycling hub,"From pv magazine India
pv magazine: What are the challenges to battery energy storage manufacturing in India?
Nitin Gupta: The Prime Minister of India has set an ambitious target of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based energy generation in India by 2030 and a reduction of one billion tonnes in total projected carbon emissions by 2030. To meet these targets, India will need to ramp up its grid storage and significantly increase the number of electric vehicles (EVs). This, however, necessitates increasing local manufacturing, exploring new avenues, and allowing global competition in emerging sectors such as energy storage.
The production-linked incentive scheme for advanced-chemistry battery cells (PLI-ACC Scheme) permits a technology-agnostic approach. It allows the beneficiary firm to select any suitably advanced technology, the corresponding plant and machinery, raw materials, and other intermediate goods to establish a cell manufacturing facility to cater to any application.
The programme envisions an investment that will boost domestic manufacturing while also facilitating the creation of battery storage demand for electric vehicles and stationary storage and the development of a complete domestic supply chain and foreign direct investment in the country. 
Attero
While the plan has its heart in the right place, a few things still need to be fine-tuned. The timelines for localisation appear to be too stringent, considering the lack of requisite manufacturing infrastructure and export base in the country. Incentives under the PLI-ACC Scheme will be disbursed only after the committed domestic value addition and actual sale of the ACCs. The bid documents call for a quarterly subsidy disbursement for the beneficiary company and certification from an independent engineer. The extent of the subsidy will vary depending on the engineer’s approval, affecting the practical implementation and timeliness of such disbursement. Furthermore, the above-mentioned subsidy limit will have to be considered when disbursing the subsidies.
The PLI-ACC Scheme provides that the beneficiary must achieve a domestic value addition of at least 25% and incur the mandatory investment (INR 225 crore/GWh) within two years. A penalty is levied every day beyond the timelines set for such localisation.
pv magazine: What India must do to address supply chain concerns? 
China controls more than 97% of the world’s lithium supply even though it does not have any significant lithium mines. It created a refining infrastructure for lithium and became a dominant player globally.
India should take the lead in becoming the Li-ion battery recycling hub of the world. To do so, we have to ensure that we recycle all the Li-ion batteries in an environment-friendly manner. We also need to ensure maximum recovery of battery materials like cobalt, lithium, nickel, graphite, manganese, and copper. Both of these can be ensured by having the right recycling technologies in place, which is where Attero is right now.   
India is already taking steps in this direction and is on the path of becoming ‘Atamnirbhar.’ We as a country also realise that recycling will play an important part in making us self-reliant. On the policy front, there have been a lot of initiatives taken in the recent past, and we should start seeing results soon. 
pv magazine: What’s the current recovery rate in battery recycling at the global level, and what has been the target? What are the main concerns within the battery recycling process itself?  
The global recycling industry is growing at a CAGR of 19.6% and is expected to reach US$22.8 billion by 2030, up from US$4.6 billion today. The extraction efficiency of Attero Recycling’s process is greater than 98% for all battery materials (cobalt, lithium, graphite, nickel, and manganese).*
pv magazine: Does India have the right policies and schemes to ensure a circular economy for batteries? 
The government has been taking steps to promote a circular economy and encourage the concept of recycling. The government is also in the process of introducing extended producer responsibility (EPR) for Li-ion batteries. Under this, manufacturers will become accountable for the entire lifecycle of Li-ion batteries. Steps are also being taken to pump in more investments in the space. 
Recycling is the best way to ensure our country’s long-term development. Metals account for more than 30% of a li-Ion battery in value terms. We do not have cobalt or lithium reserves in India. We can help India become ‘Atamnirbhar’ in these critical battery materials by recycling the end-of-life batteries. As India continues to leapfrog and prepare for the EV era, lithium-ion battery waste is expected to increase by 40-80%year on year. To brace for this revolution, we should also start preparing to manage and recycle the lithium-ion waste that these cars will produce.
