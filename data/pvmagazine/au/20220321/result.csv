Despite being blessed with high solar irradiance, Broome has been plagued by a fragile grid. Current hosting capacity constraints limit how much rooftop solar Broome’s electricity network can accommodate without disrupting supply.
Horizon said the new energy storage solution means excess energy generated by rooftop solar would be absorbed by the batteries, which will simultaneously smooth the flow of energy back into the network. This will ensure reliability of power supply and allow for a greater uptake of rooftop solar.
The Broome batteries are expected to free up an additional 1.4MW of hosting capacity. It is expected 1100kW will be made available to businesses, with the remaining 300kW going to residential customers.
The allocation is likely to be snapped up quickly with residents in the town demonstrating a hunger for solar power. In July 2021, 900kW of new solar hosting capacity was made available to Broome residential customers. The allocation was exhausted in less than 12 hours.
Horizon said in an emailed statement that site works for the energy storage solution have already commenced. Applications for rooftop solar are due to open at the end of the month and the batteries are expected to be providing benefits to the community by the end of April.
Perth-based service provider Blue Tongue Energy (BT Energy) has been awarded the contract to supply and install the batteries. Four 400kW/279kWh mtu EnergyPack battery energy storage systems sourced from UK-based manufacturer Rolls-Royce will be deployed across two sites in Broome.

BT Energy last week confirmed it had received shipment of the first of the batteries and testing had begun.
“Sites works are well underway in the northwest of the state and the first battery system has arrived from Europe,” the company said in a social media post.
BT Energy said the batteries will undergo Integrated Functional Acceptance Testing (FAT) on a simulated grid at the company’s temporary test facility in the Perth suburb of Malaga. Once that is complete the energy storage systems will be transported to site where they will undergo Site Acceptance Testing (SAT) before commissioning and handover.
While the Broome batteries will facilitate the uptake of rooftop solar in Broome, Horizon said they will also provide a solar smoothing service to customers with systems over 30kW, eliminating barriers for commercial customers to connect solar by providing frequency support to the network.
Horizon customer experience general manager Krystal Skinner said batteries add significant cost to solar installations and require additional hardware to be installed at the customers premises.
“For a fixed daily fee, Broome customers will now be able to access Horizon Power’s community battery to provide solar smoothing instead,” she said.
“This new customer solution will make it easier for businesses to access solar energy by providing a cost-effective alternative to installing an onsite smoothing battery, removing the need for upfront costs, the land required, and the ongoing safety and maintenance commitments.”
The community batteries are a part of Horizon’s $75 million Renew the Regions program, which will also see community battery energy storage systems installed in Derby, Carnarvon, Yungngora and Exmouth by the end of 2022.
The program has already delivered a 582kW/583kWh community battery in the East Pilbara town of Marble Bar while systems in Wiluna and Yalgoo were also commissioned late last year.
The program aims to free up around 10MW of hosting capacity across the nominated towns, providing more than 3,000 households across regional WA with the ability to connect their systems.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/21/agl-gets-tick-of-approval-for-2gwh-liddell-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 21, 2022",AGL gets tick of approval for 2GWh Liddell battery,"Australian energy utility AGL confirmed at the weekend it has received approval from the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Planning and Environment (DPIE) to build a 500MW big battery, with up to four hours of storage, at the site of the soon-to-be-closed Liddell power plant near Muswellbrook in the Hunter Valley.
The grid-scale lithium-ion battery energy storage system is part of AGL’s plans to establish an integrated, low-carbon energy hub at the site of the ageing coal-fired generator that is to be shuttered early next year.
AGL said the first unit of Liddell is due to close next month, with the remaining three units to close in April 2023.
Planning documents indicate the big battery will have at least a 20-year operational life and will be built in three stages. The first phase of the project involves the installation of 150MW of battery storage. Work on Phase 1 is expected to be complete by the time the coal-fired plant shuts down.
NSW Treasurer Matt Kean said the Liddell battery would play an important role in supporting the transition of the energy sector to renewable power generation as coal-fired generation is increasingly withdrawn.
“Big batteries combined with solar, wind and pumped hydro will help to deliver some of the cheapest and most reliable energy to the families and businesses of NSW,” he said.
The approval of the Liddell big battery comes just weeks after AGL announced it had fast-tracked the closures of its two biggest coal-fired power plants by several years.

AGL said the 2,640MW Bayswater power station in the Hunter Valley will be shuttered “no later than” 2033, two years ahead of its previously scheduled closure of 2035, while the 2.210MW Loy Yang A plant in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley will now close by 2045 rather than 2048.
Fellow gen-tailer Origin Energy has also brought forward plans to close its coal-fired Eraring power station in the Hunter region, announcing last month the 2,880MW plant will be closed in August 2025, seven years earlier than previously scheduled.
AGL chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said the transition of the Liddell coal-fired power plant into renewable energy hub would mark the company’s first rehabilitation of a thermal coal site.
“This planning approval marks a significant milestone for the transition of the Liddell site,” he said. “We look forward to working with partners to progress other developments on and around the site, including a wind farm, a solar storage system, pumped hydro, a waste-to-energy plant and our recently announced green hydrogen pilot with Fortescue Future Industries (FFI).”
The Liddell battery forms part of AGL’s plans to add 850MW of grid-scale batteries to its portfolio by 2024.
Construction had has already started on a 250MW/1GWh battery being developed at the site of its Torrens Island power station in South Australia.
It has also lodged a planning application to construct a 200MW/800MWh battery at its Loy Yang power station. AGL has already received the tick of approval from NSW planning authorities for a 50MW/100MWh battery in Broken Hill and has announced support for battery projects at Wandoan (100 MW) in Queensland and Maoneng (4 x 50MW) in NSW. It is already operating the 30 MW/8MWh BESS at Dalrymple in South Australia.

Brokhof said firming technology like grid-scale battery storage would be critical to the ongoing integration of renewable sources into the national grid.
“As Australia moves forward and we increase our reliance on renewable generation, batteries will be critical in providing the storage needed to maintain a consistent, reliable and affordable energy system,” he said.
“All of these developments will benefit from the excellent resources and infrastructure these sites feature and create the jobs of the future across many industries, not just energy.
“This is a trend that is already happening overseas with more than 150 energy hub projects announced globally, all of them aimed at creating new business development opportunities and value creation.”
The planning approval for the Liddell battery comes as AGL continues to progress its plan to split into two listed entities – energy retailer AGL Australia and electricity generator Accel Energy – by June 30.
Under the proposal, AGL Australia would own its retailing division and some cleaner generation assets, while Accel Energy would house its fleet of coal- and gas-fired power stations.
As part of the demerger, AGL has outlined plans to diversify these thermal power sites into renewable energy hubs, which may include big batteries, hydrogen production and carbon capture and storage.
Earlier this month AGL rejected an $9 billion buyout offer from a consortium including software billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management, saying the offer understated the value it believes will be unlocked through the demerger, including its vision for energy hubs.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/21/call-to-mandate-rapid-shutdown-technology-surfaces-in-wake-of-floods/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 21, 2022",Call to mandate rapid shutdown technology surfaces in wake of floods,"After a second consecutive year of major flooding in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland, solar industry group Safer Solar has urged state governments and regulators to mandate energy management systems that can quickly and easily shut down solar PV installs, warning if nothing is done a tragedy is inevitable.
Australia has one of the highest per-capita rooftop solar installation rates in the world with a combined 17GW now installed across more than 3 million rooftops. More than 25% of Australian households are now generating power on their roofs. Safer Solar estimates more than 90% of these systems include high voltage direct current (DC) wiring that is live whenever the sun is shining.
The Melbourne-based organisation estimates that about 700,000 houses equipped with rooftop solar systems were in areas devasted by the recent flooding, highlighting the need for Australia to mandate rapid shutdown technology on solar PV systems.
“With solar panels installed on one in four Australian homes, many systems lack a quick and easy way to shut down solar panels in the event of a fault or emergency, creating a serious safety threat for homeowners, first responders and tradespeople,” Safer Solar said in a statement.
“Solar panels that were not shut off before the floods may begin generating electricity when the sun shines, potentially without the safety systems designed to protect people from uncontrolled high-voltage electrical currents.”
As well as calling for the mandating of rapid shutdown technology, Safer Solar is also pushing for the introduction module-level power electronics that can remotely monitor solar systems, allowing for individual solar panels that fail to meet safety standards to be remotely isolated.
United States-based microinverter maker Enphase Energy is a member of the Safer Solar organisation and is among those advocating for the introduction of the rapid shutdown technology, saying it provides a quick and easy method to de-energize PV modules to ensure complete safety for first responders and eliminate the risk of electrocution.

Enphase Australia general manager Wilf Johnston said Australia lagged behind many other countries in mandating safer solar technologies such as rapid shutdown of solar systems.
“Rapid shutdown is already mandated in the US so solar panels can be made to stop producing energy in the event of a disaster like fire, flood or tornado,” he said.
“Even developing countries such as Thailand and the Philippines now mandate rapid shutdown systems.”
Johnston said the risk in Australia is increased by the fact that many solar systems are now 10 or more years old, adding a decade’s wear-and-tear to the technology.
“Australia needs to mandate that replacements for these old systems and all new systems meet the highest safety standards – which includes rapid shutdown,” he said.
Master Electricians Australia chief executive Malcolm Richards supported the call for better safety measures for rooftop solar, saying “without urgent action” serious injury or death is inevitable.
“Household rooftop solar panels are not new in Australia, but thankfully we have had only a handful of major floods since the solar boom began around 15 years ago,” he said.
“What that means is that we’ve been lucky so far in avoiding any serious injury or death from live solar panels during an emergency. However, without urgent action, it can only be a matter of time until we do face a tragedy.”
Richards said even if the network supply is turned off, solar panels still produce electricity, and the associated wiring is also live.
“We need to address this through legislation and upgraded standards and we need our state governments and regulators to step up on this issue,” he said.

Guinness World Records has confirmed the world’s largest solar tree has been installed in India.
The construction, which has 309.83m2 of solar panel surface, has been constructed at the Centre of Excellence for Farm Machinery, Ludhiana, in Punjab by the Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute, which is part of the government’s Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.
The structure, which has smashed the previous solar tree record of 67m2 of panel surface, has a generation capacity of 53.6kWp and can generate an estimated 160-200kWh per day.
Harish Hirani, director of the Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute, said: “These solar trees have wide applications such as distributed power generation to cater [to] the needs of different integrated farming activities of charging e-tractors, e-power tillers, and EV [electric vehicle] charging stations; running agriculture pumps for irrigation needs; solar-based cooking systems for food preparation at the farm site; and powering the cold storage needs of the farm produce, thereby increasing the shelf life [of the goods].”

The World Bank is aiming to provide electricity to 490 million people this decade by installing 210,000 mini-grids, a webinar focusing on the local networks in Africa has heard.
Tatia Lemondzhava, an energy specialist at the multilateral development finance institution, told an event organized by Solarplaza, falling prices could see mini-grids offer electricity to 500 million people by 2030, the deadline for achieving the United Nations sustainable development goal of providing universal energy access.
With Bangladesh preparing to announce on Monday that it has achieved that historic goal, the online event predicted Nigeria would need US$10 billion of the US$200 billion the World Bank estimates will be needed to supply universal access in sub-Saharan Africa.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, and Sudan will each need US$7-10 billion, according to Lemondzhava, and each of Angola, Burkina Faso, Kenya, Mozambique, Niger, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe will require US$4-7 billion of investment.
Some US$155 billion of the US$200 billion total will be needed for household electricity access – US$62 billion on off-grid systems and US$93 billion for the expansion of grid networks – and a further US$40 billion would fund panels for schools, health centres, and clean cooking facilities, as well as funding the right enabling environment for such projects to be installed, according to the World Bank representative.
Lemondzhava added, the development body has already invested US$1 billion in mini-grids over the last decade while attracting US$1.1 billion from public and private sector partners.
