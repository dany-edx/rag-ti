Reports have emerged of a fire and subsequent explosion at a silicon packaging workshop owned by Hoshine Silicon in the Shihezi Economic and Technological Development Zone of China’s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.
Local government officials reported a fire broke out at Hoshine’s ‘997 siloxane’ packaging facility at around noon June 8.
pv magazine learned the accident was under control by 10.40 p.m., local time, after five fire-fighting units arrived at the scene.
Hoshine this morning said the incident had occurred at a unit which had a trial production line under operation and no casualties occurred as a result of the fire and explosion.
Local government environment department staff tested air conditions around the factory and found no toxic or otherwise harmful gas pollution at the scene, officials said last night.
The cause of the accident was said to be under investigation.
Sources said nearby businesses evacuated non-essential staff around half an hour after the fire started, with several nearby blocks subsequently sealed off by traffic control personnel.
Hoshine Silicon’s LinkedIn page describes the polysilicon producer as “the largest silicon metal producer in the world with its own coal and thermoelectricity.”
In 2019, the company’s silicon metal output reached 560,000 metric tons and accounted for around 26% of the Chinese market and almost 17% of the global supply.
The factory unit affected by the fire is one of Hoshine’s two major manufacturing bases and an independent source claimed the explosion occurred in the 200,000-metric-ton-annual-capacity second phase of the production complex, with the adjacent, 390,000MT facility still operating at normal output.
Although Hoshine this morning stressed production had not been affected by the incident, solar manufacturers already seeing input costs rise as a result of a polysilicon shortage, will be concerned at the potential closure of the fab for safety inspections, as it feeds downstream silicon manufacturers in Xinjiang including Xinte, Daqo, and GCL-Poly.
An anonymous source said: “It will be up to local government whether this accident will influence the market, [either by a] little or heav[ily].”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/09/whats-been-lost-amid-the-solar-tax-outrage-and-how-the-reforms-benefit-solar-customers/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,LEGAL,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 9, 2021",What’s been ‘lost’ amid the ‘solar tax’ outrage and how AEMC’s reforms benefit solar customers,"After spending a year in consultations, it took just hours for the outcry to begin. In March, the Australian Energy Market Commission, Australia’s energy rule maker, released its draft rule determination – a massive reform package focussed on how to integrate new energy technologies like solar and batteries into Australia’s electricity grid.
“It’s a profound change,” the Commission’s Chief Executive, Benn Barr, told pv magazine Australia about the determination. Perhaps the most profound of the proposed changes, he says, is that for the first time distributed energy exports will become classified as a service.
“It’s kind of got lost though,” Barr says.
The reforms the Commission put forward unfold in three parts, but just one has guzzled virtually all of the attention – two-way pricing or, as it has been dubbed, the ‘solar tax.’ Basically, the Commission wants to remove the rule banning electricity networks from charging solar households for exporting.
Whether networks take up this opportunity and how they decide to structure it will be managed on a case-by-case basis. Nonetheless, the change has drawn outrage from many corners, who have lobbed the criticism that it disincentivises solar at a time when we desperately need to decarbonise our electricity grid.
The Commission is adamant this is not the case. “We want more customers to have solar but we don’t want to do it in an inefficient way,” Barr says.
We will come to two-way pricing and the Commission’s defence, but first what’s been overlooked and why it matters.
Currently, networks need to comply with a number of rules as part the service target performance incentive scheme (STPIS) – but since exports are not classed as a service, there are neither rewards nor punishments for how networks manage them. And since there are neither rewards nor punishments at stake, few networks have bothered to invest serious money into making export services better.
In other words, networks don’t have a reason to make their grid work for solar customers. And often they don’t.
For example, in areas where the grid is already congested by high rooftop solar penetrations – as is the case in parts of South Australia – networks have stopped allowing new solar customers to export their surplus electricity into the grid at all. Another way some networks have dealt with congestion is by introducing blanket export limits. So even if a household has installed 10 kW of solar on its roof, it could never export more than 5 kW.
Clean Energy Regulator
While this is only happening in particularly congested grids today, the rate at which Australians are installing rooftop solar means such measures will undoubtedly become more common.
What lays behind these blunt measures is that few networks actually have visibility over what’s actually going on in today’s increasingly complicated grid, and how customer exports are affecting it. Rather than investing the time and, more importantly, money to find out, networks naturally opt for the easiest fix, which is simply to stop exports happening.
Which is why the Commission is proposing that exports be classed as a service. Its thinking is that this shift will prompt investment by networks.
“For the first time, network businesses need to take [exports] into account,” Barr explains.
Barr is keen to ensure those investments, however, are not just in traditional poles and wires, but in new technologies which will help networks better manage the electricity systems.
The other key component of the service classification, Barr says, is that regulators will be better able to hold networks to account.
The regulator in this case is the Australia Energy Regulator (AER), which will expand its oversight under the Commission’s proposed changes. Given that energy companies regularly rank among the least trusted brands in Australia, and since networks have hardly tripped over themselves to integrate solar households, concerns about handing them more power to charge customers have unsurprisingly been churned up in recent discussions.
To his, Barr says the proposed changes to the regulatory framework will mean networks literally “have to” consult much more closely with the Regulator. “We’re giving the Regulator the final say on whatever the poles and wires businesses come up with,” he says. “There’s a lot of protections for customers in the draft.”
Endeavour Energy
Which brings us to two-way pricing – giving networks the opportunity to charge solar customers for exporting when during times of surplus of supply in the middle of the day. The change has been labelled anti-solar, which the Commission insists it is not.
“We all want more distributed energy in the grid,” Barr says. But we need to integrate it in ways that are helpful and make sense.
Barr is also quick to point out the Commission’s role is to design for the future. “How the Commission makes its decision is it looks at the long term,” he says. Part of that is ensuring all consumers to benefit, not just early solar adopters who haven’t suffered from export caps or limits.
“It’s not just about solar PV either,” he adds. Batteries and electric vehicles are also front of mind. “That wave is coming,” Barr says, so it’s crucial to integrate the needs of those newer technologies into rules.
While increased rooftop solar penetrations can be seen as beneficial for the broader community by driving down wholesale electricity prices, they can also be costly for networks – especially when prices are pushed into negatives which can destabilise the grid.
Ausgrid
This is where two-way pricing comes in – the Commission says its a way of making sure the grid gets electricity when its needed, which is something we need to plan for if we want to keep our it stable.
“Two way pricing allows a signal to be sent as an incentive,” Barr says.
It’s also hoped that this change will help drive batteries and other technologies like smart home systems which can help smooth out the so-called midday duck curve. While household batteries are still too expensive to be financially viable for the majority of households, prices are falling fast, and other technosolutions like smart meters are quickly filling the gaps. The Commission’s hope is the rule change would hasten these onto the market.
Be that as it may, notable players like the Victorian government have expressed concerns about the two-way pricing proposal.  “It is not clear why a charge that dissuades export of low-cost clean energy will deliver a net positive outcome for consumers,” Victorian government said in its submission to the Commission regarding the draft.
New South Wales’ Energy and Environment Minister, Matt Kean, has also voiced trepidations about the move, as has Queensland’s Mick de Brenni.
Even companies like Tesla and Enphase, which both sell storage and energy management products the new rule are designed to promote, said they not sold on two-way pricing. For instance, Tesla is concerned about the impacts the changes might have on Virtual Power Plants, suggesting community batteries could flatten the curves two-way pricing tries to resolve.
Submissions for the draft rule determination closed on May 27, and the Commission is currently reviewing them.
In light of these responses, Barr says the Commission will decide whether it should alter its draft.
Ultimately, Australia’s electricity grid’s transition is going to cost real money. The question the Commission is grappling with is who is responsible for paying? 
It’s final answer to this rather unenviable question is expected in July.

Once built, the project would be the largest hydrogen production facility in Queensland.
“Stanwell has now signed an option agreement with Economic Development Queensland locking in land for the facility, which is an exciting step towards the proposed project becoming a reality,” Miles said.
The state-government expects the project could generate $4.2 billion in hydrogen exports, $10 billion for the Queensland economy, and create more than 5,000 jobs for regional Queenslanders.
“We know countries like Japan are looking to the Sunshine State to meet their emissions targets, and in the next decade, Queensland must be ready to capitalise,” Queensland’s Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen Minister, Mick de Brenni, said.
“That’s exactly what the Stanwell-Iwatani project will do, scaling up to over 3,000 megawatts of electrolysis capacity by the early 2030s, with millions of tonnes of renewable hydrogen to be exported around the world.”
CS Energy
The state-owned Stanwell has undergone a major pivot towards renewables, and in May announced plans for a 150 MW/300 MWh battery adjacent to its 1.4 GW Tarong Power Station in Central Queensland. Stanwell’s acting chief executive, Adam Aspinall, said Stanwell had been investigating hydrogen opportunities since 2018.
“We recently completed a joint planning study for the project with Iwatani and we are now building a broader consortium of Japanese and Australian companies to progress the project to the next stage in the second half of 2021,” he said.
“As a business, we are progressing a range of future energy solutions to ensure we are in the best position possible to respond to changing market conditions.
Aldoga, where the 3 GW facility is to be located, falls into the Gladstone region, which is shaping up to be a major renewable hydrogen export hub and is located nearby the Central Queensland Renewable Energy Zone.
In March, London-based Eco Energy World announced plans for a 200 MW green hydrogen plant with 100 MW of energy storage in Gladstone. Just south of the region in Queensland’s Western Downs, the state government, via its state-owned CS Energy, is looking to develop a renewable hydrogen plant next to the Kogan Creek Power Station, in another Japanese partnership – this time with engineering company IHI Corporation.
Gladstone also recently joined the National Energy Resources Australia (NERA) network of hydrogen technology clusters, which seeks to seed innovation and productivity by interconnecting players in the hydrogen field.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/09/a-repair-tape-for-cracked-backsheets/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,QUALITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARIAN WILLUHN,"JUNE 9, 2021",A repair tape for cracked backsheets,"From pv magazine Global
Backsheet failures in solar panels are a reasonably common occurrence and affected panels frequently require replacement in a process which has involved lengthy legal battles and severe engineering challenges. DuPont Photovoltaic Solutions, though, has now brought to market a solution which promises an easy fix – a Tedlar-based band-aid for modules.
The materials supplier estimates that, in Europe alone, about 6 GW of solar capacity is affected by backsheet failures. After years of service in humid or dry, hot or cold conditions, and under severe UV-light irradiation, backsheet materials can suffer from defects, with some materials more susceptible than others. If backsheet failure reaches a critical stage, the film begins to crack, exposing the rear of the semiconductor. That can lead to leakage currents and isolation faults in the system, which will trip the inverter and shut down the array. In such cases, service teams have to make site visits to switch arrays back on, adding expense and loss of income to a site owner’s costs.
In the past, modules suffering in that manner had to be swapped, which may be no easy task if the power class of the new module needs to be the same as that of the device it is replacing. If voltage or current differs on a replacement panel, it cannot simply be integrated into an existing string and new electrical layouts need to be made, which involves planning and engineering work.
DuPont has come to the rescue with its PV Rescue Tape, at a fraction of the cost of panel replacement. The material is a Tedlar-based backsheet that comes with butyl rubber adhesive. Faulty modules can be dismounted in the field by a trained service group from Sc-refit GmbH, an affiliate of Suncycle GmbH. The service crew can fit the new backsheet onto the module using a proprietary tool or there is the opportunity of sending modules to Sc-refit’s repair centres.
“We are delighted to be partnering with DuPont to support this much-needed solution for the PV market,” said Sc-refit chief executive Roberto Gacitua. “There is great demand from both module manufacturers and asset owners for repair products which can help extend the usable lifetime of solar panels. Our specialised repair process, customised for Tedlar PV Rescue Tape, reduces costs versus a full replacement of affected panels. It also helps to improve overall returns on investment of solar assets, making it a win-win solution for everyone involved.”
The solution can be applied to any type of backsheet and is designed to stick to severely cracked surfaces. Sc-refit will commercialise the solution in Europe. The partner will accredit and operate a network of service partners to accommodate rapid deployment of the product.
