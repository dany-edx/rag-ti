The Australian government agency will provide $220 million to prop up the lithium mining project, which is one of the largest and highest-grade hard rock lithium deposits in the world. The Kathleen Valley mine is aiming to export 500,000 tonnes of lithium internationally, mostly to South Korea and the US.
Back in September, the board of Liontown Resources backed Albermarle’s refreshed bid for the company and its assets. Soon thereafter Rinehart set about upping her stake in the publicly listed Liontown, growing it from an original 4.9% stake to a 19.9%, spending $1.3 billion to do so, according to the Australian Financial Review.
The activity ultimately caused Albermarle to withdraw its $6.6 billion takeover bid, saying “growing complexities associated with the proposed transaction” meant that the takeover was “not in Albemarle’s best interests.”

The corporate turbulence has no doubt cast doubts over how the major project will proceed, as Liontown had been targeting production from as early as next year, and already secured offtake agreements with Tesla and South Korean battery giant LG Energy Solution, and Ford.
Export Finance Australia will providing the funds through an export credit agency (ECA) facility, alongside a syndicate of commercial banks and funders, Australian Resources Minister Madeleine King said.
“The ECA Facility will also allow for the potential later participation of export credit agency counterparts, the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) and the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation (K-Sure) in the project, subject to EXIM and K-Sure eligibility criteria and credit and risk requirements being met,” her announcement noted.
Provision of EFA finance is subject to all financing conditions and regulatory approvals being met.

Rystad analysed public price data from 39 electricity markets globally and found that Australia’s NEM is experiencing the most fluctuations in daily prices of any system.
The key metric used to measure volatility was the average one-hour intraday spread for a year of data, i.e., the difference between the highest and lowest price during a given hour, it said.
This volatility is the result of losses of supply from unplanned coal generation outages and transmission line problems caused by natural disasters such as cyclonic winds or bushfires, which have become more frequent and devastating in recent years, Rystad said.
“Extreme price fluctuations are also down to high solar power penetration. While daytime generation is high, pushing prices down, elevated natural gas prices are causing soaring rates in the evenings and at night when solar generation falls and gas-fired generation is needed,” Rystad said.

The company also noted that solar has driven significant renewable energy growth in Australia in the past year. Australia’s total renewable energy output reached 7 TWh, up 13% year-on-year. “Solar accounted for most of this increase, generating 1 TWh more than in September 2022,” Rystad said. 
On the other hand, wind generation basically remained steady, increasing just 1% year-on-year, while hydro generation dipped slightly.
Rystad noted that storage is the solution to these volatility woes – something already well known. Australian governments have been pushing schemes to accelerate the rollout of storage, most notably with the federal government’s new Capacity Investment Scheme, auctions for which kicked off this year across the country.
Given energy arbitrage is one of the primary income streams for storage projects, high volatility should help propel more projects in Australia.
Rystad says a total of 46 GW and 640 GWh of pumped hydro and utility-scale battery storage capacity will be needed to balance the Australian market by 2050. It noted Australia currently has just 2.8 GW.
Other global electricity markets with high volatility included Japan and the Philippines, plus select regions of the US such as California and Texas.

Nonetheless, it has long been rumoured Australia will be given special considerations and access under the Inflation Reduction Act, though exactly how this will work is not yet certain. 
Hysata officials are reportedly joining Australian Prime Minister Albanese as he visits the US and President Biden these next days. Biden extended the invitation after he had to cancel his official visit to Australia earlier this year. Although their timing is still far from ideal given the duel crises in the Middle East and in the US Congress, Australian delegates are set to focus on “building an alliance for the future,” clearly with an eye on clean energy.
Hysata is one of Australia’s most hyped hydrogen companies, claiming to have made a major breakthrough in electrolyser technology. The electrolysers are based on a breakthrough made at the University of Wollongong on the New South Wales south coast.
Hysata is currently developing a manufacturing facility near Port Kembla, with Paul Barrett, the company’s chief executive, saying it expects to ramp up to 1 GW of capacity annually within years. 
Currently, 100 MW of manufacturing capacity being built and this production line is expected to come into operations next year.

Alongside this generation facility, Energys says it is expanding its hydrogen equipment manufacturing facility in Mulgrave, aiming for 50 MW of fuel cell products annually as part of its phase 1 expansion. The dates for this phase 1 expansion, however, have not been made public.
Energys’ ventures have been supported by grant funding from the Victorian government, which has put $1,115,185 (USD 730,000) towards the Telstra Renewable Hydrogen Fuel Cell Generator Pilot at Mobile Sites project. 

The pilot will see Energys’ 10 kW fuel cell systems deployed at Telstra’s telecommunications towers in Coldstream, Kinglake, Christmas Hills, Chum Creek, and Neerim North – all of which have a history of storm-related power blackouts. The systems are intended to be a “drop-in zero emissions replacement” for the diesel generators currently being used at those sites.
The hydrogen systems from Energys are set to provide 72 hours of backup power to the sites, according to the Victorian government. Telstra is also set to power its five fuel cells using green hydrogen from Energys, though specifics on how this parallel hydrogen fuel supply deal will work have not been provided.
“This Hydrogen Fuel Cell Pilot at five mobile base stations in Victoria will provide us with valuable data and experience of this emerging technology and how it may help to power telecommunications into the future,”  Telstra Group’s Executive for Global Networks and Technology, Nikos Katinakis, said.
Energys’ says its third-generation Hydrogen Fuel Cell Generator is part of a range of zero-emissions power products designed and manufactured in Victoria – and that it is the result of seven years of research and development. 
The system, it added, has been designed “specifically for large-scale manufacture using Energys’ proprietary engine design,” with the company claiming the product is one of the world’s leading mass-producible hydrogen gen-sets commercially available today.

Energys Managing Director, Dr Roger Knight, says that alongside solid products, it is vital to have a strong supply chain to deliver in volume. “We have that, and much of it is local,” he said.
Like many hydrogen plays, Energys is targeting the diesel replacement market – though its focus isn’t solely on diesel for transport but also in applications like backup gen-sets for remote areas. “The diesel generator market is over USD 20 billion [$31.5 billion] per annum,” Knight said. “That’s an enormous demand for fossil-fuel-based generators that must be phased out.”
In terms of Energys hydrogen production facility, little is known, though the company says it is “already under construction,” noting the location and details of the facility will be announced in coming weeks. The facility will use electrolysis, Energys says, though it has not specified whether it will establish its own renewable energy projects to power this or simply use energy from the grid with renewable energy certificates.
In its announcement, Energys included a note about its hydrogen production facility, saying “$1m grant for $4m project cost,” though it is not entirely clear if this is on top of the $1.15 million the Victorian government has allocated for the Telstra pilot or refers to the same sum.
Either way, funding was provided as part of the Victorian government’s $6.6 million Renewable Hydrogen Commercialisation Pathways Fund.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/24/flexible-demand-standards-for-pools-introduced-in-the-us/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"OCTOBER 24, 2023",Flexible demand standards for pools introduced in the US,"From pv magazine USA
The California Energy Commission (CEC) has issued flexible demand standards for swimming pool controls. Starting in September 2025, pool controls sold in the state must default to operating pool equipment when electricity prices and greenhouse gas emissions are low. Both conditions are met at times of high renewable generation.
The commission has set a goal to achieve 7 GW of load flexibility by 2030, to complement 38 GW of new clean generation capacity the state projects to need by that year. Load flexibility can shift some consumption to times of high renewable generation, reducing renewables curtailment.
The pool control standards will help meet the 7 GW load flexibility goal, the commission said, delivering nearly 400 MW of flexible demand by 2030. The commission estimates that consumers on a time-of-use rate plan can save USD 1,131 ($1,784) over the life of the pool control, through operation when electricity costs are lowest.
To lay the groundwork for improved time-of-use rates, the commission set a requirement last year for the state’s large utilities and large community choice aggregators to develop retail electric rates that change at least hourly to reflect grid costs, and post those rates to a state database.
Working in coordination, another California agency, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), had previously decided to institute a rulemaking to advance demand flexibility through electric rates, a practice sometimes called “sending prices to devices.” That decision was informed by a CPUC staff white paper on opt-in dynamic pricing.
The CEC was granted authority to adopt flexible demand appliance standards in 2019 by California Senate Bill 49. Pool controls are “the first of many devices” expected to be “upgraded,” the CEC said.
A Pacific Northwest National Laboratory study found that allowing customers to opt for real-time pricing, and to shift some consumption to lower-priced periods, would lower customer bills 10% to 17%, including savings for those who don’t opt in, and could save USD 33 billion ($52 billion) per year nationwide.
Pilot studies in California have demonstrated that real-time pricing works, and the CPUC has noted that “several jurisdictions currently offer real-time pricing rates.”
The California Community Choice Association has called on the CPUC to expand statewide a pilot program for opt-in dynamic pricing for farmers using automated agricultural pumping equipment.
California’s new pool control standards include cybersecurity standards to protect consumers using flexible demand appliances connected to the internet. User consent is required for the device to send and receive information, including data on changing electricity prices.
The CEC said the new standards complement the agency’s “historical role in adopting world-leading standards for appliance efficiency, building energy efficiency, and load management.”
