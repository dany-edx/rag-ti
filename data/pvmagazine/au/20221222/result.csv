Supplies of high-quality water must also be secured into the future to support our agriculture, industries, cities, towns and communities. Climate change and population growth will increase pressure on these supplies.
Community discussion is needed to identify where the water to produce hydrogen will come from. We need to ensure this developing industry does not disadvantage other water users, as we discuss in our new white paper
Japan, Korea, Germany, and other EU countries are trying to cash-in on Australia’s incredible renewable hydrogen potential.
Green renewable hydrogen could power the 21st century, and Australia could lead the world in this clean industry. @hansvan333 https://t.co/Pw5Dgklpix

Green hydrogen is likely to partially replace petrol and diesel for large vehicles such as trucks and heavy machinery as Australia moves to a carbon-neutral economy. It has the advantage of being a fuel suitable for sectors such as mining and transport that are struggling to reduce emissions.
The green hydrogen market is expected to grow rapidly. Hydrogen energy outputs in Australia are estimated to exceed 100 MW by 2025. More than 90 projects representing $250 billion in investment are planned.
Most demand for hydrogen this decade is likely to be domestic – for chemical production, industrial processes and other uses. In the longer term, major export demand is expected from the Asia-Pacific.
By 2040, Australia’s green hydrogen production cost is predicted to be the equal-lowest in the world. Electrolysis, which splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, will be the main method of producing this green hydrogen.

The amount of water needed to generate green hydrogen varies. The exact amount of water required depends on the technology used to produce hydrogen, the water quality and any need for cooling or water purification.
On average, a litre of water can produce enough hydrogen to deliver about 10 megajoules of energy. That’s enough to push a 50-tonne truck 15 metres.
The previous Australian government predicted the hydrogen industry could be worth A$50 billion a year by 2050. At that scale, it would need about 225 billion litres (gigalitres) of water. While that’s roughly as much as residents of a city like Perth use in a year, it’s only about 3% of the water used for agriculture in Australia in 2020-21.
There are many possible sources of water. Surface water, groundwater and recycled water are all available inland. Coastal areas have unlimited seawater, which can be desalinated for hydrogen production.
It accounts for approx. 30% of Australia's water use, but because it can't be seen like rivers and lakes, many people don't know about #groundwater💧
So, how can we 'see' this important, but invisible resource?

But there are trade-offs whenever we allocate a water resource. In many areas, the available fresh water is fully allocated to towns, cities, agriculture, industry and the environment. The pressure on water supplies will increase as populations grow and much of Australia becomes hotter and drier under climate change.
Further, most water would have to be treated to be suitable for hydrogen production. Treatment can be expensive and uses additional energy, as does desalination and pumping water long distances.
Current issues in the gas industry provide a cautionary tale. High gas prices in eastern Australia can be deemed the result of failure to consider impacts on domestic customers of developing a gas export industry.
Western Australia, in contrast, reserved enough gas for domestic users. As a result, its prices are among the lowest in the OECD.
A similar failure may arise if corporations buy high-quality water for hydrogen generation, diminishing supplies for agricultural, domestic or environmental use. North Africa expects to export substantial amounts of green hydrogen to Europe, but this is controversial because of regional water shortages.
In Australia, competition for water will intensify due to climate change and ongoing demands from agriculture – 72% of national water consumption in 2020-21 – industry, mining, households and the environment. Using potable water to produce hydrogen may be at odds with community expectations.
Care must be taken to ensure industry expansion does not adversely affect other users. This will be particularly difficult in Australia because rainfall is highly variable by world standards – not news to those who have lived through recent years of drought then flooding rains.
Australia has already overshot limits on biodiversity, land-system change & nitrogen & phosphorus in our rivers while being nearly there on water use & climate change. When will we start to listen to the scientists and act? https://t.co/JkxhdmHLvu

The project, which is to be renamed the Capricornia Energy Hub, will integrate pumped hydro projects totalling 1.4 GW, with more than 1 GW of solar, a 500 MW wind farm, battery energy storage and a hydrogen electrolyser to support export scale hydrogen production.
The original developers, Renewable Energy Partners and Bowen River Utilities, said the first stage of the pumped hydro project has been designed to deliver 750 MW and 16 hours of storage (12,000 MWh). Stage 2 is expected to deliver an additional 12,000 MWh of storage.
CIP Australia Vice President Matthew Stuchbery said the energy hub aligns with the firm’s strategy to pursue multiple energy storage technologies to support Australia’s switch to renewables.
“We are absolutely investing in things like battery storage, but we’re of the view that a portfolio approach even for storage is going to be required to meet Australia’s needs,” he said.
“Batteries are a technology that are fit for purpose for shorter time periods, but there is no other commercial technology available that operates in the same time period to the same scale as pumped hydro does.”

The original developers had indicated the first stage of the pumped hydro project was expected to be online by 2028.
Stuchbery said CIP would re-evaluate the timeline but would ensure the project remained on track to deliver large-scale storage by the end of the decade.
“I think we would be targeting a final investment decision in the middle of this decade,” he said.
CIP, a major player in developing renewable energy projects in Europe, said it will now look to advance the approvals process and geotechnical investigations and continue to work with the Queensland government-owned utility CS Energy which earlier this year signed a deal with the previous project proponents for a potential power purchase agreement.
The investment adds to CIP’s rapidly growing pipeline of renewable energy projects in Australia, which includes a stake in the 2.2 GW Star of the South wind project being developed in the Bass Strait off Victoria’s Gippsland coast.
CIP has also partnered with Hydrogen Renewables Australia to develop the 5 GW Murchison Renewable Hydrogen Project near Kalbarri in Western Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/22/opensolar-to-boost-online-pv-platform-capability-with-22-million-injection/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,RESIDENTIAL PV,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 22, 2022",OpenSolar to boost online PV platform capability with $22 million injection,"OpenSolar announced it has raised more than $22 million to accelerate the development of its solar design and proposal platform, providing greater levels of customisation and new capabilities to solar contractors who access the free-to-use platform in more than 130 countries.
The Series B funding round was led by Telstra Ventures, the venture capital arm of telecommunications giant Telstra, with participation from Danish sustainability fund 2150 and existing investors including United States-based private equity firm Titan Grove and solar entrepreneurs Alec Guettel and Howard Wenger, the head of American solar energy company SunPower.
Sydney-based OpenSolar’s platform provides end-to-end digital design, sales and management software to solar contractors. The company said the digital toolkit integrates data from more than 75 hardware, finance and services providers to generate installer-branded quotes that detail solar system size, optimal orientation and design, and savings on current bills.
The platform allows installers to generate quotes, supported with visuals, from a smartphone, tablet or internet-connected laptop.
OpenSolar co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Adam Pryor said the new capital will support continued investment in the platform to extend it functionality, providing greater levels of customisation and new capabilities to solar contractors.
“The world’s transition to solar energy represents one of the greatest wealth creation opportunities in history, and our commitment to help local solar installers participate in that change is stronger than ever,” he said. “This funding allows us to double down on developing an ever-expanding set of software tools that increase their growth and profitability.”

In addition to the opportunities to expand the capabilities of the platform, OpenSolar said the funding will allow it to increase the number of partnerships it has around the world, earning fees in exchange for connecting solar contractors to products and service providers.
OpenSolar co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Andrew Birch said the switch to solar is predicted to generate more than $3 trillion in value by the end of the decade and the company is ideally positioned to take advantage of this opportunity.
“We started OpenSolar in Australia which is the most advanced solar market in the world, where you pay an extremely low price per watt and get your system installed within one to three weeks,” he said. “With a leading position now in the Australian market, we’ve introduced much of that speed and efficiency to the rest of the world through our software.”
Telstra Ventures Partner Albert Bielinko described OpenSolar’s offering as “the world’s leading solar design and sales platform.”
“We are firm believers in this unique business model that’s free to the installer and also highly valuable to hardware and service providers,” he said. “OpenSolar’s clients are raving fans who use their open platform to dramatically increase the number of installations they can perform. It lets them achieve more with less.”
This latest financing round brings OpenSolar’s total funding to date to $37 million.

The package is funded by $4.7 billion from the federal government’s $20 billion Rewiring the Nation program and $3.1 billion from the NSW Transmission Acceleration Facility.
The joint $7.8 billion deal will back eight transmission and REZ projects including the HumeLink project which will reinforce the transmission network in southern NSW and is deemed essential for the success of the federal government’s 2 GW Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project.
The VNI West interconnector, which would link northwest Victoria and southeast NSW, is also on the list for funding.
Other projects included are the Sydney Ring – Hunter Transmission Project, Sydney Ring – Southern Sydney Ring; and the Central-West Orana, Hunter-Central Coast and South-West REZs.
NSW Treasurer and Energy Minister Matt Kean said the funding deal would unlock $32 billion worth of private sector investment in transmission and generate thousands of jobs in the renewable energy sector.

“This investment will support the delivery of our Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap through fast-tracking the development of REZs and transmission infrastructure,” Kean said.
“It’ll support the delivery of 3,900 jobs here in NSW and it will unlock the opportunity to deliver $32 billion worth of private capital that will deliver new generation, storage and firming over the next decade.
“This is an absolute game changer.”
Transgrid Chief Executive Officer Brett Redman said the funding package would allow the network operator to bundle key transmission projects into a single continuous construction program, saving on both time and costs.
“We’re facing increasingly tough global competition for critical resources and this funding enables considerable efficiencies to be gained through combined procurement of materials and secure pipeline opportunities for workers across multiple projects,” he said.
Redman said bundling HumeLink, VNI West and the EnergyConnect project together will reduce capital expenditure by up to $500 million, through savings in procurement, labour and avoided inflation costs.

Iberdrola Australia and hydrogen developer Abel Energy will build a green hydrogen and green methanol production plant at Bell Bay in northern Tasmania, Australia. The $1.7 billion (USD $1.14 billion) Bell Bay Powerfuels project will be backed by the Australian government. “Bell Bay Powerfuels will produce 200,000 tonnes of green methanol per year in its first phase of development, rising to 300,000 tonnes in its second phase. This will make the project one of the largest in the world,” wrote the Spanish electric utility. Green methanol will primarily supply the shipping market.
Woodside Energy has awarded a contract to Air Liquide for the liquefaction equipment at its proposed H2OK hydrogen project in Ardmore, Oklahoma. “Air Liquide will provide the engineering and fabrication of two 30 tonne per day liquefaction units which will liquefy hydrogen produced through electrolysis in preparation for storage, loading and transportation to customers,” wrote the Australian company.
TECO 2030 signed a contract with ThyssenKrupp for the delivery of the first complete fuel-cell stack production line at TECO 2030 Innovation Center in Narvik, Norway. “The equipment is validated and completed in Bremen before shipment to Narvik, which takes place Q1 2024,” wrote the Norwegian start-up, with installation taking place. The facility will be the first Gigafactory in Europe for Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells. It will have an annual capacity of 120 MW production in 2024, increasing to 400 MW in 2025.
Ørsted has acquired the remaining 55% stake in the 50,000 tonnes/year FlagshipONE e-methanol project from the developer Liquid Wind. FlagshipONE, the company’s first commercial-scale Power-to-X facility, is expected to enter into operation in 2025 in northern Sweden and will focus on the world’s shipping industry. Ørsted will start onsite construction of FlagshipONE in the spring of 2023. The Swedish project will be on the grounds of the biomass-fired combined heat and power plant. The e-methanol will be produced using renewable electricity and biogenic carbon dioxide. The facility will use steam, process water, and cooling water from the heat and power plant. Excess heat from the e-methanol production process will be integrated into their district heating supply.
Lhyfe and Schaeffler have signed an agreement to boost green hydrogen production in Bavaria, Germany. “The plan is to build and operate an electrolysis plant on Schaeffler’s factory premises in Herzogenaurach, Franconia with a capacity of up to 15 MW,” wrote the French hydrogen producer.
