The EV charing stations will be located along what the government called “key travel routes”, with the network spanning a total distance of over 3,000 kilometres.
Each of the stations will be 160 kilometres apart on average, a distance intended to put EV drivers at ease.
The tender for the charging stations’ design is anticipated to hit the market by the end of the year, with the EV charging network expected to be fully operational by early 2024.
The stations will see EVs charged in as little as 15 minutes, with the McGowen government saying the locations were determined by the state-owned energy providers Synergy and Horizon Power in consultation with the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation, and aim to encourage tourists to explore regional towns while their cars charge.
WA government
“Western Australia is a vast state and our huge fast-charging network will give electric vehicle owners confidence they can travel far and wide by eliminating any concerns around range anxiety,” Western Australia’s Environment and Climate Action Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson said.  “This infrastructure is a key to boosting electric vehicle uptake in the state and helps continue the transition to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.”
WA’s government today also launched its Electric Vehicle Action Plan, which aims to provide a set of actions to prepare the state for a rapid uptake of EVs. “The McGowan government is preparing for the future, with 20% of new car sales in Australia expected to be electric by 2030,” Energy Minister Bill Johnston said.
This year, the government’s plan is to focus on industry collaboration, sharing knowledge to integrate distributed energy resources (DERs), EV and batteries at fringe of grid. It also wants to ensure network operators have visibility of new connections while keeping the customer EV purchase and connection journeys simple.
The plan ramps up next year, when the state government will begin discussing EV tariffs, carrying out customer research, planning scenarios and developing models to assess uptake impacts. By 2024, the state is hoping to have consumer protections in place.
The new fast-charging network announcement is part of the state government’s $21 million Electric Vehicle Fund and the State Electric Vehicle Strategy for Western Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/17/aemos-2025-goal-means-that-sa-becomes-the-proving-grounds/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",,"AUGUST 17, 2021",AEMO’s 2025 goal means that SA becomes the proving grounds,"While this challenge may not be as pressing for all NEM regions, the need to identify methods/ technologies to enable higher asynchronous generation is a welcomed objective in future proofing the NEM. To visualise the differences between regions in this transition, the chart summarises the last 18 months in the NEM into duration curves of the renewable percentage of local generation for each NEM region and the level of supply being supplied from asynchronous sources (this includes import volumes in the calculation). Behind-the-meter resources have been omitted from the analysis given the grid operation focus.
The significant presence of coal in the system for the foreseeable future means that the goal is not as pressing in QLD, NSW and VIC. It is also not as pressing for Tasmania which operates a mostly 100% renewable energy system. TAS is however increasingly incorporating higher asynchronous generation levels where 20% of the time, more than 50% of generation requirements come from asynchronous generation sources. However, the significant hydro capacity (i.e. synchronous gen) in the region means that TAS can have its cake and eat it too.
The region which is most of interest is South Australia. To be clear, SA is already on the cusp of 100% instantaneous renewable power. Over the last 18 months, local grid-level renewables have exceeded local SA demand in ~13k dispatch intervals (~8% of the time). However, despite this, AEMO still rely on gas generation in the state as the key to system stability. At a minimum there is at least 250 MW of gas generation online regardless of VRE penetration. So, the crux of AEMO’s 2025 goal is to remove the necessity to direct thermal units to remain online for system strength. New synchons in the state should reduce the need for SA gas units to remain online as well as announcements for large grid-forming batteries like from AGL.
However, the capability is a first but important step. The key question then is when AEMO would then have the operational confidence to reliably operate the grid with 100% instantaneous power from asynchronous sources. South Australia likely becomes the NEM’s proving grounds for these new operational approaches (if it wasn’t already).
It is likely that system-level observations would be required as well as the presence of additional service support such as increased local FCAS provision or grid forming types of technologies. It also means that the definition and quantification of the largest contingency likely evolves from the loss of the largest single unit to the expected forecast change in VRE sources. It is unclear how this level would compare to the status quo but what is clear is that this would be a different operating paradigm for AEMO.
While the current focus on supporting 100% instantaneous renewable power is a key challenge, a similar effort should be aimed at the inverse case – particularly without coal in the system. Granted this challenge is likely to be more pressing later in the decade, it still requires attention in the near term to understand what level of dispatchable generation is required (to allow for sufficient investment and planning). As we know from recent experience (COTW #92), VRE droughts are a somewhat regular occurrence, and it is important that there is enough backup on the system to handle prolonged events effectively.

Under the agreement, the battery manufacturer will gain access to 71,000 tonnes of nickel and 7,000 tonnes of cobalt – key components of lithium-ion batteries. LG Energy Solution (LGES) says the deal secures enough raw materials to produce 1.3 million high-power electric vehicles (EVs). The six year deal, which has the potential to be extended, begins in 2024.
The agreement is only subject to one condition – which is that Sconi’s owners, Australian Mines, secure financing for the project before the end of June, 2022 – which is presumably highly likely now it has a globally renowned brand taking 100% of its product.
The proposed Sconi Project is to be located near Greenvale, about 250 kilometres west of Townsville in Queensland’s north. The $1.5 billion project claims it will become one of the world’s lowest cost producers of ethically produced cobalt, and has aa “fully auditable” supply chain.
Australian Mines is also a member of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) and has been certified as a carbon neutral organisation since 2020 under the Climate Active program.
LG Energy Solution was keen to highlight these aspects of the mine, also noting in its press release that Sconi will use what’s called a dry stacking method – a more sustainable way of storing ‘tailings’, the mining term for the waste materials left after the target mineral (in this case cobalt and nickel) has been extracted. Dry stacking aims to decrease the risk of groundwater contamination associated with mining as well as using less storage space.
LGES, in its statement, said it hopes the deal will “enhance its competitiveness in ESG [Environmental, Social and Governance] management.”
“Securing key raw materials and a responsible battery supply chain has become a critical element in gaining a greater control within the industry, as the demand for electric vehicles worldwide heightened in recent years,” LG Energy Solution’s president and CEO, Jong-hyun Kim, said.
“LGES will solidify its position as the world’s leading battery manufacturer through a steady supply of raw materials for EV batteries,” he added.

Researchers from Germany’s Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and the Helmholtz-Institut Ulm (HIU) have built a lithium-metal battery with a new combination of cathodes and electrolytes, which they claim can help the device reach an energy density of 560 watt-hours per kilogram.
The battery is based on a low-cobalt, nickel-rich layered cathode known as NCM88, which the scientists said offers a high energy density and improved stability for the battery compared to commercially available organic electrolytes known as LP30. “In the LP30 electrolyte, particle cracks occur on the cathode,” HIU professor, Stefano Passerini explained. “The electrolyte reacts within these cracks and destroys the structure and thick, moss-like lithium-containing layer forms on the cathode.”
According to the researchers, this reaction negatively impacts the battery stability and is currently the main issue preventing their technical and commercial maturity. In order to address this matter, they used a low-volatility and non-flammable ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) incorporating two anions known as bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (FSI) and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI).
They further explained that the combination of the new cathode and electrolyte favours the formation of a cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer in the electrolyte which protects the NCM88 surface against detrimental reactions with the electrolyte itself, thus avoiding the formation of microcracks. The dual-anion electrolyte is also said to show compatibility with the lithium metal and the high-voltage positive-electrode material used for the device.
“This electrolyte enables initial specific capacity of 214 mAh g−1 and outstanding capacity retention of 88% over 1,000 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.94%,” the German group said, noting that the new configuration of the electrolyte significantly reduces the structural changes in the nickel-rich cathode. The Coulombic efficiency is the ratio of discharge capacity to charge capacity within the same cycle.
All the details on the battery can be found in the paper Dual-anion ionic liquid electrolyte enables stable Ni-rich cathodes in lithium-metal batteries, which was recently published in Joule.

Xos Inc., a manufacturer of fully electric commercial vehicles, has announced the release of Xos Hub, a mobile charging station for EV fleets. The tow-behind unit can be deployed in the fleet yard without having to wait for a traditional infrastructure installation, said Xos.
The mobile unit can simultaneously charge up to five vehicles with its CCS1 charge port connectors, and fits in two standard parking spots. It can hold up to 3 MWh of energy storage and has 480 V single-phase and three-phase inputs. Solar panels on the roof of the unit power the cloud-enabled control and safety system.
The company also offers an on-demand infrastructure-as-a-service platform for site evaluation, energy storage development, installation, and energy management services. The announcement of Xos Hub follows a recent business combination with NextGen Acquisition Corp.
As the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden announced its target of a 50% electric vehicle sales share in 2030 for the United States, creative commercial solutions are arising to address the need for rapid electrification. Charging access is often seen as a bottleneck for electric vehicle adoption, and Xos’ solution is one way to alleviate said bottleneck.
Work is already underway at the federal level to address EV charging constraints. Recently, the Department of Energy’s Vehicle Technology Office (VTO) announced a US$62 million (AU$85 million) package for the decarbonisation of the transportation sector, for example. The VTO said it will support the expansion of EV infrastructure, partly by hosting community-level EV demonstrations and installing EV charging within multi-unit housing, among other activities.
