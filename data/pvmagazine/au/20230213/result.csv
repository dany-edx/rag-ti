The funding, allocated as part of the state government’s Resources for Regions program, will allow council to plan, build and install the proposed $4 million Eugowra Solar Farm.
The project, to be built on an eight-hectare site about two kilometres south of Eugowra, will comprise PV panels mounted on a PEG frame system featuring steel rods driven into the ground, eliminating the need for concrete footings. Application documents indicate the panels will be mounted in a dual east-west static configuration to maximise higher yields in the morning and afternoon.
The facility will connect to the grid via Essential Energy’s existing 11 kV distribution line which is located near the project site.
The project is also expected to include a battery with the development application outlining plans for the deployment of energy storage units of an unspecified technology or capacity “to store power for electricity use at night.”
“Phase two is currently being analysed but will form a natural progressive step to fully utilise the power generated by the solar farm,” the application reads. “Phase two would consist of two power storage units. This may be in various forms such as a battery or alternative energy storage systems such as hydrogen.”

Cabonne Shire Mayor Kevin Beatty said the Eugowra Solar Farm project will bring down energy expenses across all 85 council-owned sites and help council achieve its renewable energy targets.
Beatty said the benefits of the project will also extend beyond the boundaries of Cabonne Council which is one of 16 councils in the central NSW and Riverina regions that comprise the Central NSW Joint Organisation Councils association.
“This renewable energy project plans to create and develop regional jobs, stabilise the energy distribution network, and provide Cabonne Council, and all Central NSW Joint Organisation Councils, additional power to meet their 50% renewable energy target by 2030 or earlier,” Beatty said.
The Resources for Regions program is part of the $3.3 billion Regional Growth Fund, designed to support growing regional centres, activate local economies and improve services and community infrastructure for regional communities.
Deputy Premier Paul Toole said the Resources for Regions program has delivered 355 projects worth $560 million to mining communities since its inception in 2012, stimulating local economies and delivering critical infrastructure.
“The Resources for Regions program is about giving back to these mining communities that contribute so much to the NSW economy,” he said. “It’s absolutely crucial we continue to support regional mining towns that supply our state with the resources needed to keep the lights on and the economy moving forward.”

The London-based Glenmont is one of the world’s largest renewable energy investment managers with more than $5.56 billion (EUR 3.6 billion) of renewable power generation projects and assets under management across Europe. The fund manager is 100% owned by US asset manager Nuveen, which has an estimated $1.88 trillion in assets under management.
Glenmont said it will target both combined and standalone solar and energy storage projects, with a view to developing, constructing and operating the assets.
While Glennmont has not yet provided any timelines for its entry into the Australian market, it is seeking to recruit a renewable energy investment manager to drive the company’s Australian investment agenda.
Glennmont Partners Chief Executive Officer Joost Bergsma told the Australian Financial Review the company initially plans to acquire, build and operate solar farms of more than 100 MW, and to spend upwards of $145 million in Australia.
“We’re getting into solar at an early stage,” he said. “We typically look at getting in almost at development phase … and at that scale, battery storage can help with grid issues.”
The move is part of a plan to grow the business in the Asia region with Bergsma saying the Australian market has become increasingly attractive with the change of federal government bringing a change of tack on climate policy.
The federal government has passed a climate change bill which enshrines a 43% emissions reduction by 2030 and net zero by 2050 into law. This is underpinned by the government’s Powering Australia Plan which aims to see 82% of the nation’s power derived from renewable energy by the end of the decade.
“I think there’s a much broader commitment now to the clean energy transition than there was three or five years ago, when it seemed to be a bit more politicised,” Bergsma said.
“Now, I think there’s a combination of the political landscape, with the populace really wanting to drive this energy transition, as well as the fact that solar is cheap, it’s really economic now.”
Glennmont’s move into the Australian market follows recent entries into the US, Swedish, and South Korean markets. In the US, the fund manager has teamed with GreenGo Energy to develop more than 1 GW of standalone solar and energy storage projects, with the first projects expected to come online in 2025.
In South Korea, Glennmont is investing in 80 MW of solar projects as part of a joint venture deal with South Korean renewables developer SK D&D.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/13/energy-australia-fined-1-5-million-after-workers-death/,"LEGAL,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 13, 2023",Energy Australia fined $1.5 million after worker’s death,"Electricity gen-tailer Energy Australia has been fined $1.5 million after a Yallourn power station employee suffered fatal burns to 90% of his body in an electrical explosion at the facility in November 2018.
Graeme Edwards, 54, died in hospital a day after he sustained severe burns in an arc flash and explosion that occurred while he was racking a 6.6 kV circuit breaker in a high voltage switch room that was being returned to service after a planned major outage.
The Melbourne County Court heard the incident likely occurred when a control cable being held by Edwards made contact with live components of the circuit breaker.
Investigations found that an infill panel on the switchboard cabinet that was supposed to protect workers from contact with the arc flash had not been secured properly.
Energy Australia Yallourn Pty Ltd was fined $1.5 million in relation to Edwards’ death, which the company conceded at a plea hearing was “avoidable” and “preventable.”
“There is absolutely no excuse for it,” the company said during a 2022 pre-sentence hearing. “It was avoidable and it was preventable and he shouldn’t have died. The reason why he died is due to the failings on the part of Energy Australia.”
The power station operator pleaded guilty to three charges under the Occupational Health and Safety Act.
The company was fined $700,000 for failing to provide and maintain plant that was safe and without risks to health, $300,000 for failing to provide information, instruction and training, and $500,000 for failing to provide or maintain safe systems of work.
Melbourne County Court Judge John Carmody said if the company had not pleaded guilty, it could have been fined a total of $2.2 million.
WorkSafe Executive Director of Health and Safety Narelle Beer said the devastating loss of Edwards was compounded by the fact that his death was preventable.
“WorkSafe hopes there is a degree of comfort to Mr Edwards’ family, friends and work mates knowing that the many learnings from this tragedy will go a long way to help prevent similar incidents in the future,” Beer said.
“Today’s outcome is a reminder to duty holders of the potential costs of failing to ensure workers are protected from health and safety risks.”

Vast Solar Chief Executive Officer Craig Wood said the $203 million project seeks to demonstrate the technical and operational performance of the company’s modular CSP technology at utility scale, helping to unlock further investment in future projects and provide another pathway for Australian industry to decarbonise.
“The world-leading VS1 plant will have an important impact on the future of clean, dispatchable energy generation in Australia and globally, allowing us to sustainably power electricity grids overnight,” he said.
“We are grateful to the Australian government who are taking a clear stand to support the energy transition in Australia, creating jobs and supporting local industry.”
Vast Solar’s CSP technology utilises mirrors to concentrate and capture heat from the sun in solar receivers, with high temperature heat transferred via liquid sodium and stored in molten salt. The stored energy can then be used to heat water to create steam to drive a turbine and produce electricity, or the heat can also be used directly to decarbonise some industrial processes.
The Sydney-based developer said its technology allows plants to be configured with four to 16 hours of storage and generators of up to 500 MW.
Wood said one of the benefits of CSP is that the captured heat can be stored cost-effectively for long periods with little loss of energy. This means that CSP can be used to generate electricity or provide heat on demand, including overnight.

The technology is on show at Jemalong in regional New South Wales where a 1 MW pilot plant, which was constructed adjacent to a 50 MW solar PV project, has been delivering electricity to the grid since early 2018.
ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said the expansion of Vast Solar’s technology into a commercial-scale project illustrates that CSP technology could play an important role in generating and storing renewable energy at scale.
“With the increasing need for dispatchable renewable generation and longer duration energy storage, CSP has potential to assist Australia’s energy transition alongside pumped hydro and large-scale batteries,” he said.
ARENA’s funding for VS1 is conditional upon the project reaching financial close, which is targeted to occur in late 2023. VS1 is expected to take two years to build with commercial operations commencing late 2025.
This latest funding announcement comes after Vast Solar recently secured almost $40 million as part of the HyGate program, a collaboration between the Australian and German governments to establish a green hydrogen supply chain between the two nations.

That funding will support Vast Solar, as part of the broader Solar Methanol Consortium, to develop a green methanol production plant which will be co-located with VS1 near Port Augusta.
The Solar Methanol 1 (SM1) project entails the use of a 10 MW electrolyser for the manufacture of green hydrogen as an input to green methanol production. Electricity and heat generated by the VS1 project will be used to power the electrolyser. It is anticipated the facility will produce 7,500 tonnes of green methanol per annum.
Energy Minister Chris Bowen said Vast Solar’s home-grown CSP technology could be a “game changer” for Australia, helping support the government’s goal of getting the electricity grid to 82% renewables by 2030.
“Making this technology commercially viable on a larger scale could go a long way to meeting the growing need for dispatchable renewable energy, energy security and longer duration storage,” he said.
The VS1 project is expected to generate up to 450 regional jobs during construction and 70 ongoing operational roles in long-term manufacturing, plant operations and maintenance.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/13/zinc-ion-batteries-for-residential-applications/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWEDEN",MARIJA MAISCH,"FEBRUARY 13, 2023",Zinc-ion batteries for residential applications,"From pv magazine Global
Enerpoly has developed configurable, modular zinc-ion batteries for stationary storage applications. They are suitable for short- to medium-duration storage applications of two to 10 hours.
Its 3 kWh battery packs weigh 60 kilograms and measure 800 mm x 177 mm x 432 mm. They operate in the temperature range of -10 C to 50 C. The nominal voltage stands at 48 V, with a nominal capacity of 60 Ah. The battery packs have a maximum charge/discharge power of 2.8 kW, with 1.4 kW of continuous power.
Enerpoly’s technology uses zinc metal as the anode and manganese dioxide as the cathode, with a water-based electrolyte. Its proprietary battery cells are built with a prismatic form factor.
It claims that the technology is safer, without the possibility of thermal runaway. The Swedish startup says it has passed all safety standards and notes that it has tested its batteries against the UL 9540A standard.
Now, Enerpoly is partnering with Austrian PV startup EET (Efficient Energy Technology) on the “ZincMate” project. The say that their goal is “to drive the development and commercialisation of an energy storage device that can be installed in all European households.”
The project partners have secured €870,000 ($1.35 million) in grant funding under the Eurostars-3 program, which originated from Vinnova and the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG). The total project budget is €1.74 million ($2.7 million).
The companies will produce ZincMate prototypes of a plug-in storage system with rechargeable zinc batteries. The technical basis for ZincMate is EET’s on-grid technology, in combination with Enerpoly’s cost-effective batteries. EET makes photovoltaic systems with energy storage that can be set up on a balcony and plugged into a wall outlet, so homeowners and tenants can produce their own renewable electricity.
EET, founded in 2017, is said to be the only company producing storage devices that can be installed by amateurs, without the help of technicians. EET’s innovation core for the SolMate device is an integrated and patented measurement technology that can assess the energy demand of a household via a power outlet connection. This eliminates the need for further installation or connection to a household’s electric grid.
“Currently, EET’s SolMate device is equipped with a state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery and it’s obvious that battery technology needs to improve,” says Christoph Grimmer, CEO of EET. “Moving to zinc-ion technology for residential applications is the next step in the right direction.”
The batteries developed under the ZincMate partnership will be tested in both laboratory and home environments, including apartments, small living spaces, and shared housing. The project will start this year and run for two years.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/13/pv-powered-seawater-desalination-for-afforestation-carbon-capture/,"RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,EUROPE,FINLAND,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"FEBRUARY 13, 2023",PV-powered seawater desalination for afforestation carbon capture,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists from LUT University in Finland have analysed the potential of afforestation carbon capture if desalinated seawater would be made available to restore forests in arid or semi-arid areas. They said that PV- and wind-powered seawater reverse osmosis desalination can produce water to maintain enough trees to capture 730 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) between 2030 and 2100.
“This new concept may lead to an additional PV demand of about 10.7 TW and 19,700 TWh of PV electricity,” researcher Christian Breyer told pv magazine.
The team chose a mix of trees in desert and arid climate zones to simulate the carbon capture and water demands of forests grown on dry land between 2030 and 2100. They used the LUT Energy System Transition Model (LUT-ESTM) to analyze the energy requirements of afforestation and to estimate the electricity, water, and global carbon sequestration costs over the 70-year period.
The results show that the world’s areas with the greatest potential are the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), followed by sub-Saharan Africa. These regions have a cumulative CO2 sequestration potential of 131 gigatonnes and 87 gigatonnes by 2070, respectively.
”This potential is driven by the availability of restoration and bare land areas with demand for desalination in these regions,” the scientists said.
The regions with the least potential by 2070 are Europe (3.4 gigatonnes) and Eurasia (1.2 gigatonnes), due to the low availability of suitable land.
The annual global cost of irrigating and maintaining restored forests with desalinated water has been estimated at €457 ($708) per CO2 tonne in 2030. Costs fall to €99 per CO2 tonne by 2100. Costs are higher in Afghanistan, Iran, Chad, and Niger, mainly due to water transportation costs that are higher than the global average.
The global average levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) decreases from €46.90 ($72)/MWh in 2030 to €31/MWh by 2100. This includes the cost of electricity for continued water supply for irrigating the forests and for powering desalination and water pumping.
“By 2050, countries with CO2 sequestration potential have more than 80% of the corresponding electricity generation from solar PV, highlighting the high solar irradiation levels in regions with afforestation potential,” the academics said.
Battery storage is used to support PV generation during low electricity production, meeting up to 67% of the global electricity demand, according to the study. This solar application could capture 0.26 gigatonnes of CO2 per year by 2050, improving to 6.7 gigatonnes of CO2 by the end of the century, claimed the scientists.
The researchers published their findings in “Afforesting arid land with renewable electricity and desalination to mitigate climate change,” which was recently published in Nature Sustainability.
