Key records were:
– NEM’s (National Electricity Market) Record: We witnessed the highest ever 5-minute Native Demand in the history of the NEM. Native Demand is total demand plus non-scheduled generation plus rooftop PV. This surpasses the previous record set on Jan. 31 2020, just before the onset of the first Covid lockdown. The milestone illustrates a remarkable rebound and growth in energy demand.
– Victoria’s Native Demand: Victoria also experienced its highest 5-minute Native Demand, reaching 10,972.5 MW on Feb. 22 2024 at 15:35 hrs. This is an increase of 540.8 MW (5.18%) from the previous record of 10,431.7 MW on Feb. 17 2023, aligning with the hot weather over a number of days during the working week.
– Renewable energy and curtailment in Victoria: In addition to demand records, Victoria set a new record in Renewable Energy (RE) plus curtailment, hitting 7,335.4 MW on Feb. 22 2024 at 13:25 hrs. This is up by 419.64 MW (6.07%) from the previous record of 6,915.7 MW on Feb. 13 2024. This highlights the growing contribution and impact of renewable energy in the region’s energy mix.
As always, these records reflect the evolving energy landscape in Australia, the resilience of our infrastructure, the changing patterns of consumption and a recovery from the pandemic, now a distant memory. They also underscore the importance of robust energy policies and the increasing role of renewable sources.

1,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/23/horizon-power-presses-go-on-smart-connect-solar-in-carnarvon/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",ALEISHA HEY,2024-02-23,Horizon Power presses go on Smart Connect Solar in Carnarvon,"Horizon Power has announced the launch of Smart Connect Solar in in the town of Carnarvon, to ensure grid stability amid high levels of solar penetration. The approach couples digital balancing of PV assets via remote balancing of PV generation over the internet.
Electricity networks face challenges in managing the variable nature of solar power, during periods of high generation and low demand. Horizon Power’s solution employs advanced forecasting and energy management techniques to predict and regulate the flow of solar energy onto the network, ensuring a stable and reliable electricity supply.
Carnarvon, an agricultural town in the Gascoyne region of WA, has high levels of rooftop PV penetration. It also recorded the world’s hottest day on Feb. 20, with the mercury climbing to 49.9 C – testing the town’s microgrid system.
In 2011, Horizon Power halted rooftop PV installations in Carnarvon over fears that the large amounts of PV would crash its grid.
Ray Achemedei, Executive General Manager at Horizon Power said the implementation of Smart Connect Solar in Carnarvon means more access to renewables for regional WA communities. “This exciting project demonstrates our support for the State Government’s target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and helps us towards our goal of zero refusals when it comes to connecting rooftop solar by 2025”.
The introduction of Smart Connect Solar in Carnarvon is a strategic move to unlock the full potential of solar energy in the community. By facilitating a higher integration of rooftop solar systems without compromising the grid’s stability, Horizon Power is setting a precedent for the scalable adoption of renewable energy across its other serviceable areas.
Smart Connect Solar has the ability to manage energy flow dynamically, meaning that more residents and businesses can install solar systems without the risk of overloading the grid.
“These projects help us explore how to connect higher levels of renewable energy into our microgrid systems, without impacting the stability of the network. The learnings we’ve gained along the way have made Smart Connect Solar possible,” Horizon  stated.
The rollout of Smart Connect Solar is slated to occur in phases, with Carnarvon leading the way.
Horizon Power plans to bring the technology to all towns under its service by the end of 2024. Horizon serves WA electricity consumers outside of the South West Interconnected System (SWIS), which is managed by AEMO.
Behind the scenes, Smart Connect Solar employs sophisticated algorithms and real-time data analytics to optimise the energy network.
By predicting solar output and adjusting the flow of electricity accordingly, the system can mitigate the risk of grid instability, ensuring that energy supply remains consistent and reliable.
The use of internet-connected solar technology, called a Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS), to predict weather patterns and forecast energy generation and demand in Western Australia, also allows for quick responses in real time to any changes in network load and weather conditions.

2,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/23/qld-adds-210-million-to-battery-industrial-strategy/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,QUEENSLAND",JONATHAN GIFFORD,2024-02-23,QLD adds $210 million to battery industrial strategy,"QLD is looking to build a battery supply chain in the state. The Miles state government announced its intention to bring the funding available to its Battery Industry Strategy to more than $500 million.
The $210 million in new funding will go towards establishing “capabilities across the value chain” including the establishment of standards and testing, the government announced on Thursday, Feb. 22.
“Building a Queensland battery industry creates jobs here in the Southeast in mining critical minerals in the North West, in minerals processing in Townsville and new clean economy jobs across our regions including Cairns, Gladstone and Maryborough,” said state premier Steven Miles in a statement.
The $570 million in total funding will look to develop and commercialise new battery technologies, drive investment into projects across the supply chain, and to promote QLD-made “advanced materials and batteries” in international markets.
The QLD government hopes that the battery industry could create over 9,000 jobs and contribute $1.3 billion to the state’s economy by 2030.
The state’s battery industrial strategy appears to be an attempt to foster a new economic segment in the state as coal export revenues decline over the decade. By targeting battery material extraction, processing, and end-product manufacturing, the government is hoping to establish an energy storage supply chain throughout the state.
“As global economies decarbonise, the demand for battery storage is set to grow exponentially. There are incredible opportunities right across our state, from recovery of critical minerals to the production and refining of advanced materials, manufacturing, and integration of battery packs,” said Grace Grace, the minister for state development and infrastructure.
The strategy is a marked departure from Australia’s approach to renewable energy development in the past. The country has been instrumental to the development of technologies and the training of engineers that have played a crucial role in the development of China’s solar manufacturing segment – with the UNSW and ANU playing leading roles.
However, PV production at scale in Australia was not established. Australia’s largest solar manufacturer is Tindo Solar in South Australia – which is a module assembly operation. Tindo announced plans to expand its production from 150 MW to 1 GW, by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, China has captured huge market share across the PV supply chain – 89% of polysilicon, 96% wafer, 85% cell, and 77% of module production, according to the latest data from BloombergNEF.
QLD’s industrial strategy for batteries is part of a global trend in the clean technology sector and renewable energy industries. China has long been supportive of its clean technology manufacturing sector, solar, energy storage, and EVs, although the details of these policies are rarely transparent.
Outside of China, the Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has seen a surge of investment in the United States, and India is heavily promoting solar production across the PV value chain. The EU’s Repower EU has moved in the direction of an industrial strategy, yet the implementation of supportive policies have been slow in the bloc.
There are significant risks in attempting to foster manufacturing in highly competitive and cyclical clean technology manufacturing markets. Low lithium and nickel prices are evidence of how cyclical demand can impact operations in Australia.
In terms of solar, there will be considerable challenges to developing domestic manufacturing at a scale that would be internationally competitive. PV module prices declined more than 40% in 2023 and have put in doubt some manufacturing plans in the US, despite the generous subsidies available under the IRA.
Speaking to solar manufacturing, Wood Mackenzie analyst Steven Knell said the cost reductions achieved in China present a formidable challenge for producers elsewhere.
“There are multiple dividends through these industrial strategies like domestic employment and getting a more resilient supply chain, but from a cost standpoint the contest is over,” Knell told pv magazine Australia.
“They have been able to get costs down to a point that from a competitiveness standpoint it looks conclusive.”
Battery production, however, may produce more opportunities outside of China. Australia is home to many of the critical minerals required for a range of battery energy storage technologies. And the development of battery manufacturing is less mature than solar, presenting more opportunities.
New technologies, as encouraged by the QLD battery strategy, could well find a place in the fast-growing energy storage marketplace.
“Some of the long money coming into the sector, for those with proprietary technologies that look like they have legs, there is more than enough room at the table – particularly if they are innovative technologies with a cost and environmental footprint advantage,” said Knell.
Consultancy Accenture prepared a discussion paper for the QLD government, which informed the formulation of its Battery Industry Strategy. The paper found that QLD alone will generate 26 GWh of demand for batteries through 2030, with 63 GWh nationally.
On Feb. 19, Steven Miles took part in the ground breaking ceremony for the state’s latest large scale battery project, the 250 MW/500 MWh Swanbank battery. It is deploying batteries from Tesla, which are produced at factories in the US or China.

Chinese power electronics manufacturer GoodWe has developed a new outdoor battery system for commercial and industrial (C&I) applications. The Lynx C system offers 60 kWh of storage, using 11 packs of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cell-type batteries.
“To meet customers’ needs for an easy-to-install inverter-plus-battery system, the Lynx C 60 kWh cabinet includes a convenient compartment for the GoodWe ET15-30kW inverter series,” the company said in a statement. “Together, they form a complete energy storage solution, facilitating efficient energy backup, peak shaving, and streamlined load management.”
It said the battery system has a maximal charge and discharge of 96 A, and a lifespan of more than 5,000 cycles. It uses air conditioning for cooling and heating, and operates at a range of 0 C to -55 C during charge and at -25 C to -55 C during discharge.
“A standout feature is the system’s expandability. An ET 30kW/Lynx C 60kWh cabinet can be expanded by adding up to two additional Lynx C batteries, excluding the inverter compartment, creating a 30kW/180kWh system,” the manufacturer said. “Further expansions will be possible through a parallel connection of the ET series inverter, a feature that will be added shortly.”
The inverter compartment weighs around 1,029.5 kg, while the extension model weighs 972 kg. The full product comes at a width of 1.108 meters, a height of 2.05 meters, and a depth of 1.1115 meters.
“Due to the compact system design, transportation and installation become straightforward, ensuring a hassle-free setup for installers and system integrators,” GoodWe said. “The operation and maintenance (O&M) tasks are executed with high efficiency due to its modular feature, along with other features such as IP55 and C4 protection.”
