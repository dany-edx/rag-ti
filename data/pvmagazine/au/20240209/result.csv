The production line has 19 manufacturing stages from cathode power preparation and ball milling through to cell fabrication and formation cycling, with the engineering team receiving and installing a bespoke lithium foil anode cutting line and primary cell fabrication equipment.
Lee Finniear, the of CEO Li-S Energy, said as the largest advanced pouch cell production line and largest battery dry room in Australia, the facility will scale their ability to produce high quality, commercial sized pouch cells by orders of magnitude.
“We can advance our cell performance testing and be capable of providing thousands of test and trial cells to our current and future partners. Eighteen months ago, we made a commitment to scale up our production capability and as we advance the Phase 3 production line commissioning, I am delighted that we have met this substantial milestone on time and within budget,” he said.
Li-S Energy has sought to create a lightweight lithium sulfur battery with a cycle of life approaching lithium ion with over a decade of research into the use of Boron Nitride Nanotubes (BNNTs) and advanced battery technologies. The company has secured a patent patent for “flexible lithium sulfur batteries”.
In April 2023, Li-S partnered with drone developer and operator V-TOL Aerospace and Wagga-based advanced solar panel maker, Halocell Energy, which is focused on commercialising Perovskite Solar Cells (PSC), to test and develop Australian-made Low and High-Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) drones using Li-S Energy’s lithium sulfur batteries.
Halocell’s solar cells are custom designed to maximise energy harvesting efficiency and the integration of these cells into the drone’s structure will allow it to harness solar energy during day flight, supplementing the battery and significantly extending the aircraft’s range.
Halocell’s CEO, Paul Moonie said the company’s cells will add an entirely new dimension to flight time and efficiency.

Predicted to account for 10% of the entire Asian region’s solar capacity by 2030, FPV projects in Southeast Asia are growing in popularity to avoid complex agricultural land rights battles or the alternative of land clearing which requires deforestation. The research found the current combined 500 MW of operational FPV projects in Southeast Asia will expand by an anticipated 300 MW of FPV capacity in Q1 of 2024.
The Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand are predicted to be at the forefront of the trend, with Philippines-based ACEN, which has developments in Australia, working to commission a 1 GW project on Laguna Lake, south of Manila and a 200 MW project in the Filipino province of Rizal. Filipino solar company SunAsia and Singapore-headquartered Blueleaf Energy will also build a 610 MW FPV in Laguna Lake, along with projects in other locations in the Philippines.
“FPVs have emerged as a game-changer for Southeast Asia, catalysing the region’s push towards clean energy by maximising its abundant solar resources and overcoming limited land availability,” Jun Yee Chew, Head of Asia renewables and power research, Rystad Energy said. “FPVs modular design allows for integration with existing hydropower dams and unlocks tremendous opportunities for hydropower-rich nations like Laos, Thailand, and Indonesia.
“Additionally, with land rights a major deterrent facing solar developers in Southeast Asia, as much of the land is used for agriculture, FPVs provide a solution for the coexistence of solar farms and agriculture,” he said.
In Thailand, companies are contracting FPVs and procuring electricity through private power purchase agreements (PPAs), which is a strategy like rooftop solar leasing. It allows landowners to power their businesses with clean energy while mitigating the risk of disputes between solar developers and farmers, who argue for the land to be used for agricultural purposes.
Spanish-headquartered EDP Renewables (EDPR), which recently purchased ITP Development in Australia, has a 1.8 GW FPV project planned at the Duriangkang reservoir in Batam, Indonesia, signalling an acceleration of FPVs generally.
Large FPV projects in Australia remain at the planning stage, with the Victorian government’s Wannon Water allocating $1.4 million dollars in 2022 toward what would be the country’s largest 500 kW FPV array, in the Brierly Basin near Warrnambool.

2,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/09/report-finds-community-solar-flourishing-in-the-united-states/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,2024-02-09,Report finds community solar flourishing in the United States,"From pv magazine USA
Arcadia, a company that builds utility data technology to serve consumers in the community solar market, released its inaugural report on the community solar sector in 2023. The State of Community Solar report highlights the anticipated growth in an industry designed to serve all.
Community solar offers access to clean solar energy to the nearly two-thirds of Americans who do not have access to residential solar, whether it is because the don’t own their home, their roof is not positioned for solar or they cannot afford the up-front cost.
Challenges to its growth include high interest rates, increased local opposition to projects, interconnection delays, workforce issues, unfriendly regulatory environments and ongoing tariff issues between the United States and its trading partners, according to the report.
Despite these challenges, a Wood Mackenzie report expected community solar in the United States to exceed 6 GW by the end of 2023. It estimates that existing community solar projects in the US generate enough electricity to power 918,000 homes. The WoodMac report forecasts 118% growth over the next five years, with the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA) setting a target of 30 GW by 2030, which Arcadia said is an important baseline for the growth of community solar in the years ahead.
In addition to providing clean energy to ratepayers, the growth in community solar is spurring investment in American-made products. The report points to the recent Nexamp order of 1.5 GW of Heliene solar modules to support Nexamp’s growth in the community solar sector. Heliene has its headquarters and manufacturing in Ontario, Canada, and module factories in Minnesota and Florida.
In August 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the most significant climate bill in US history, giving a boost to community (and other forms of solar) through federal tax policy. Arcadia expects to see the IRA drive more innovative business models, and cites as an example the recent nationwide partnership between Arcadia, Google, and EDP Renewables NA, a collaboration that prioritizes direct community investments. According to the Arcadia report, it will deliver utility bill savings to low- to medium-income households by connecting an estimated 25,000 households in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic with 500 MW of distributed solar energy.
At the federal level, community solar also got a boost through several programs including: National Community Solar Partnership (NCSP), Low-Income Clean Energy Connector, Community Power Accelerator, and the American-Made Sunny Awards for Equitable Community Solar.
The Arcadia report notes important activity at the state level, including New Mexico, which adopted its first program, Maryland and New Jersey made pilot programs permanent. Other states, including Minnesota, dropped geographic restrictions that hobbled their community solar programming. California is expected to adopt a program this year.
With the growth in community solar comes job growth, and Arcadia notes that this clean energy option creates “sustainable, good-paying jobs that can provide economic boosts to towns that need it”. The report cites a study by the University of New Mexico that predicts that its new program will generate over 1,500 jobs, totaling $58 million in labor income and $206 million in total industry economic output. The community solar industry supports 16,785 jobs as of 2022, and this number is expected to increase
Arcadia was founded in 2014 on the belief that everyone deserves access to clean energy, and reports that it manages the nation’s largest community solar portfolio with more than 2 GW of solar under management.

3,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/09/clean-energy-regulator-module-tests-reveal-manufacturing-handling-faults/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",JONATHAN GIFFORD,2024-02-09,"Clean Energy Regulator module tests reveal manufacturing, handling faults","The Clean Energy Regulator (CER) has found very few modules supplied to the Australian marketplace do not meet required standards for safety and performance. The testing program, developed and rolled out in 2022, found that Australian standards are being met by an overwhelming majority of modules, with approximately 10% failing under EL examination.
The CER is conducting the testing program as a part of its oversight of the Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES). The positive results can give confidence to Australian home and small business owners. The small number of failures provide important quality lessons for the Australian solar industry.
The testing program is being rolled out by the CER in partnership with an independent testing laboratory. The unnamed lab specified testing sample sizes, acceptance levels, sampling methods, and nominated the manufacturers and models to be testing.
The CER reports that the modules tested in the first round of its program are representative of 71% of modules in the Australian rooftop marketplace in 2022.
In its first round, 567 modules were tested between January and March 2022. 18 module series were tested, from 14 manufacturers.
The testing program included visual inspection, EL testing, power output under standard test conditions (STC), and a wet leakage test. Aggregated test results are made available on the CER website. Testing was carried out in accordance with International Electrical Commission (IEC) standards.
Damage during transportation and handling was responsible for some of the module failures. Of the 0.5% of modules that failed visual inspection, the CER observes there were “obvious breakages.” Under EL testing, the 2.1% of failures were thought to be after manufacture.
The EL test results showed microcracks on cell edges, finger interruptions, and backsheet scratches. Cell edge cracking can be more prevalent than in the past due the widespread adoption of half-cut cells in production and the larger, thinner wafers being used. Finger interruptions can be caused by soldering defects – commonly described as “cold soldering.” 8% of the EL test failures were attributed to manufacturing defects.
In the 0.5% of modules that failed the wet leakage test, pinholes were observed on the backsheet. This can allow for water ingress or, in the worst cases, current leakage.
Despite the defects either in production or production, the CER found that “no significant safety risks [were] identified.”
 

The CER did not test for potential induced degradation (PID), or other degradation effects, but says that PID testing will be added to future rounds of the program.
Modules that fail under the testing program and investigated and further testing may be carried out. The CER says that panels can be declared ineligible under the SRES is they do not meet Australian standards, pose a risk to the integrity of Small-scale Technology Certificates, or were approved “based on false or misleading information.” If a module is found to ineligible under the SRES, STCs cannot be claimed.
The Quarter 3, 2022 testing round results were published on Jan. 31.

4,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/09/bowan-says-coalition-whipping-up-community-concern-over-renewables-energy-transition/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",JONATHAN GIFFORD,2024-02-09,"Bowen says coalition ‘whipping up community concern’ over renewables, energy transition","While the political winds for renewable energy have changed since the election of the Albanese government in May 2022, renewables deployment and emissions reductions remain contentious issues and storm clouds are brewing.
Policies like the New Vehicle Emissions Standard and Capacity Investment Scheme are pointing to the supportive framework being put in place by the Labor federal government. However, Tuesday’s Rally Against Reckless Renewables, held in front of Parliament House, demonstrate that energy policy can be politicised by opponents.
Australian federal parliament returned to Canberra after its summer recess this week. The Smart Energy Council hosted minister Chris Bowen on a webinar on Thursday, during which he warned that the opposition Liberal and National parties are looking to attack the government over its energy policy agenda.
“There are some genuinely held concerns in the regional community [about] how can we better improve community benefit and community engagement,” said Bowen. “There are people of good faith with those concerns and those whipping up community concern for political benefit.”
The Climate Change and Energy Minister said the “Dyer review” of community engagement for renewable energy development addresses some of those concerns. The review was completed by Andrew Dyer, Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner (AEIC), and was released on Feb. 2. The government has accepted, in principle, its nine recommendations.
The pressure the government is coming under regarding its energy policy was evident during Thursday Question Time in parliament. Three questions were directed to the government about its proposed New Vehicle Emissions Standards, which the opposition has labelled a “car and ute tax.” In its coverage, the ABC helpfully added parenthesis, “it’s not a tax”.
The policy is currently open for community consultation and Bowen said that public support will be required to weather attacks. “It is a fight and so we do need people that believe in this stuff telling this story. Until it passes the Senate it’s not done.”

A key piece of the federal government’s energy policy is the expanded Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS). The CIS involves reverse auctions to set floor project revenues – essentially a Contract for Difference (CfD) scheme to underwrite projects. CIS tenders have been held in South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales, however large-scale solar projects have yet to benefit from the program.
During the Smart Energy Council webinar, Bowen confirmed that the first national CIS auction is scheduled for April. He noted that he is working with the state governments to ensure that the project delivers renewable energy and energy storage capacity additional to state programs, rather than replace them.
“We’re working on how we can make sure states aren’t going to take their foot off the gas,” Bowen said. “For example, we are not going to underpin 32 GW and then have them [the projects| stuck in state planning systems for 6 years.”
The state and federal energy ministers will meet in March where the issue will be discussed. “The states said ‘we’ll work with you,’” added Bowen. The meeting is the Energy and Climate Change Ministerial Council (ECMC) and will be held in Adelaide.
Another item for discussion by the energy ministers next month will be the “National Consumer Energy Resources Roadmap.” The term “consumer energy” is being used, Bowen said, in preference the industry term “distributed energy.”
One issue that is expected to be on the table during the consumer energy roadmap discussion is the expansion of the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES) to incorporate distributed batteries. The Clean Energy Council has been pushing for such a move.
Such an expansion of the rooftop solar subsidy would undoubtedly accelerate the uptake of batteries by homes and small business. It would also help overcome network integration issues posed by high penetration levels of rooftop solar, and go some way in addressing solar’s price cannibalisation challenge.
The SRES has been extremely successful in Australia’s robust residential rooftop solar market segment. It has also proven extremely resilient to political attack and popular with voters. An expansion of the SRES to residential batteries could well be a welcome policy measure in a contested landscape.
John Grimes, the CEO of the Smart Energy Council made the case for such a measure in the webinar on Thursday. “Rooftop solar is now carrying a massive load. If we can couple the generation of rooftop solar with affordable, professional energy storage to time shift that generation it does two things: slashes power bills [for households installing batteries] and pushes down electricity prices for everybody.”
In terms of the political stakes, Bowen was unequivocal: “[Opposition leader, Peter] Dutton would be a worse PM for the climate than Scott Morrison or Tony Abbott.”
