But many other countries are also racing to expand their renewable energy production. This got us wondering: Australia’s renewable resource potential is vast, but will we actually become the world’s biggest energy exporter?
Analysis by CSIRO examined this question. We found Australia was near the top of the pack on factors such as the quality of renewable resources. But we are not the world’s best, and others are nipping at our heels. There’s still much work to be done.

Australia has always been rich in energy. We export far more in the form of gas and coal than we use domestically. And a lot of energy used in Australia goes towards producing goods for export such as minerals and metals.
The threat of climate change means the world must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. That requires less burning of Australia’s abundant fossil fuels.
Economic modelling produced by federal treasury in 2008 and 2011 revealed a gloomy outlook. It showed key industrial sectors such as coal mining, aluminium and steel would all be significantly smaller in a world that takes action to address climate change.
But a reprieve was in sight. Australia has vast amounts of the cheapest climate change solution available: renewable electricity. And between 2010 and 2020, the cost of electricity generated from wind and solar globally fell by 56% and 85%, respectively.
This turned the issue of addressing climate change from challenge to opportunity. Australia is now touted as a future clean energy superpower. There’s even talk of exporting renewable energy – either in the form of “green” hydrogen, or directly via undersea electricity transmission cables.
Much of the opportunity will come from supplying renewable energy to industry. That’s because electricity is the cheapest way to strip emissions from this polluting part of the economy.
And the opportunity goes deeper. The global transition to low-emissions technology entails an exponential increase in wind and solar plants, energy storage, and the transmission infrastructure to get the energy where it’s needed. Manufacturing this technology requires the production of minerals such as aluminium and lithium, of which Australia has large reserves.
So demand for Australia’s minerals and metals is expected to grow. And these producers will have access to cheap home-grown renewable electricity to power their operations, making them more internationally competitive.

So far, so good. But many countries are developing a renewable energy capacity. Those that can produce renewable energy at least cost will come out on top. That comes down to three factors:
So how does Australia fare? To find out, we studied 194 locations around the world in 13 regions. We determined where renewable energy could be produced most cheaply and how costs varied across the land mass.
Based on the lowest cost site in each region, we estimate the three most competitive global regions for producing renewable energy will be India, Western Europe and China. This applies both in 2030 and 2050.
Australia is ranked a close fourth in 2030. But this rank could slip one place in 2050, if Africa can make better use of its good solar sites by then.
So why did three regions rank above Australia? It partly reflects their lower labour costs and the quality of renewable resources. It’s also due to lower costs for companies installing renewable energy technologies. (Cheaper installation can also be the result of lower labour costs or, as in the case of Western Europe, a more competitive installation sector.)
We don’t know why other countries with comparable labour costs can install technologies more cheaply. But it may reflect economies of scale, or more companies competing for work.
We also calculated the average of costs across the land mass of each region. On that measure, Australia’s ranking improves to third place in both 2030 and 2050.
This indicates the deep quality of Australia’s renewable resources: it’s a windy and sunny place, which helps offset Australia’s relatively higher installation costs.
It’s worth noting, however, that other top-ranked countries face risks that Australia does not. In China and India, for example, labour costs are likely to rise faster as their economies develop.
In addition, these nations have much larger populations and so may need to reserve some renewable resources to meet domestic energy needs.

Australia’s potential to produce renewable energy at globally competitive prices promises to negate the economic pain of the energy transition. But we can’t rest on our laurels. Other nations have competitive advantages that outweigh our bounty of wind and sun.
So how does Australia stay at the top of the global pack? The main priority is to make our installation sector more competitive. This may develop naturally as the scale of clean energy deployment grows, attracting more companies to the sector.
We must also identify the necessary workforce skills and produce sufficient labour and training, to ensure Australia keeps pace with the global transition.

Expected to continue for at least 12 months across the Endeavour network, the battery trial will involve 10 community batteries with a total capacity of up to 640 kW, serving about 350 customers.
Endeavour Chief Executive Officer Guy Chalkley said the initiative promises to change the way residents consume and store energy, leading to “substantial” cost savings and a more stable energy grid during peak times.
Chalkley said the community batteries will deliver direct benefits for customers and community, helping residents to harness, share and reuse the green energy collected from rooftop solar, whether they have solar, own their home, or are renting.
“It is an exciting innovation that will see our customers both be a part of, and benefit from the energy transition, whether they have rooftop solar or not, and whether they own their home or are renting,” he said.
The first of those batteries has now gone live with residents in Bungarribee able to ‘rent’ a portion of the community battery to virtually store and access neighbourhood solar energy for $15 per month. They will then receive payments for the energy they store and/or use.

Endeavour said households connected to the battery can store up to 4 kWh of solar energy a day. A measurement device will record how much energy a participant has stored, and credits will be applied against their energy usage that day.
The company estimates that participants with solar will receive a payment of between $120 to $220 per year, and non-solar customers will earn between $80 to $120 per year.
Origin Energy will serve as Endeavour’s retail partner, providing the platform for customers to participate in the trial and will orchestrate the energy stored in the battery including dispatch to the wholesale market.
Endeavour, which owns, maintains and operates the electrical distribution network supplying 2.6 million people in households and businesses across Sydney’s Greater West, Blue Mountains, Southern Highlands the Illawarra and the South Coast, said Bungarribee is the ideal site for a community battery with 95% of households in the area having already installed rooftop solar.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/25/new-grid-forming-inverter-concept-based-on-bee-colony-algorithm/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 25, 2023",New grid-forming inverter concept based on bee colony algorithm,"Researchers from Inha University in China have created a new grid-forming inverter concept based on the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, which is an optimisation algorithm based on the intelligent behaviour of a honey bee swarm.
This algorithm mimics the food-foraging behaviour of honey bee colonies when searching for nectar. It optimises numerical problems by converting them to the problem of finding the best parameter to minimise an objective function. The algorithm moves towards better solutions, while abandoning poor solutions.
Grid-forming inverters create adjustable voltage and frequency and can operate microgrids without conventional synchronous power generators. They can also act as primary mechanisms to improve grid synchronisation, especially during low-inertia operating conditions.
The group said the proposed inverter design can work optimally on both grid-connected and islanding conditions. It combines these two different control strategies by using a Fractional Order based Proportional–Integral (FOPI) controller – a way of adding additional parameters to the algorithm.
“The FOPI controller has a higher degree of freedom compared to conventional PI controllers, and the objective of error minimization can be done more effectively,” it explained, adding that it used Monte Carlo simulations typically deployed to assess unpredictable outcomes influenced by random variables, by reducing complex processes to a set of basic events and interactions. “Monte Carlo simulation has been performed to generate the initial optimal search space.”
The controller can also operate following an adapting stopping criterion, which the scientists said helps the algorithm to stop early if a solution convergence is found. This makes the algorithm faster and more effective compared to other different optimization algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) and Gray Wolf Optimisation (GWO), which were also tested by the group with the same inverter design.
PSO is a stochastic optimisation method based on the movement and intelligence of swarms, to minimise the CoE of both energy sources in the modelling. The GWO algorithm mimics the hierarchy and hunting mechanism of grey wolves in nature.
The controllers work on quality data (qd) mode and reportedly help the inverter find the optimal solution by reducing the uncertainty of trapping into a suboptimal solution. Their operation was simulated under different scenarios such as different islanding-grid reconnecting times and their performance was tested during load changes, as well as during changes in line parameters.
Through the simulation, the scientists ascertained that crucial parameters such as frequency, voltage dq quantity, and real and reactive power reached the steady-state or the allowable range within the desired period. Their performance was found to be “satisfactory” for each load level.
The new inverter design is presented in the paper “Integrated grid forming-grid following inverter fractional order controller based on Monte Carlo Artificial Bee Colony Optimization,” published in Energy Reports.

Some of these hands may turn out to be robotic. 
The U.S.-headquartered Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) projects a demand of 800,000 new solar workers by 2030 to build the projects the U.S. needs to be on pace with its decarbonisation plan. However, 44% of solar industry employers report it is “very difficult” to find qualified applicants, said the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC). 
With this challenge in mind, solar developers are increasingly exploring and implementing autonomous, robotic versions of solar installers, particularly at the utility-scale. Two companies making recent moves are Terabase Energy and Sarcos Robotics Corporation. 
Terabase secures funds
Terabase Energy, developer of the Terafab automated installation system, announced it secured 437 million (USD 25 million) in funding. The capital raise was led by Prelude Ventures, SJF Ventures, and EDP Ventures to support a commercial scale-up of its technology.
The company describes Terafab as an automated “field factory” that can double installation productivity. The installation system makes use of digital twins, logistics software, an on-site digital command centre, a field-deployed automated assembly line, and installation rovers that can operate 24/7.

Terabase this year also opened a manufacturing facility in California; “a factory to make factories.” The facility is currently manufacturing the first gigawatt Terafab assembly line with capacity to make more than 10 GW of Terafabs per year.
Terabase said its system will double labour productivity when compared to traditional utility-scale installation methods. The system offers high-throughput, 24/7 operation, and modularity to enable rapid ramp ups and higher solar field construction speeds, significantly reducing project schedules. 
“We successfully field-tested Terafab last year, building 10 MW of a 400 MW site in Texas. Today’s launch is the next step forward to rapid commercial scale-up,” said Matt Campbell, chief executive officer and co-founder of Terabase.
Terafab is pegged for commercial deployment starting in Q3 2023. The company said that the automated installation system reduces the levelized cost of electricity for utility-scale solar projects. It is also scalable, built on a modular design that can be replicated and deployed quickly.
Blattner and Sarcos
Sarcos Technology and Robotics Company found a partner in Blattner Company to provide its automatic, robotic construction solutions to the renewable energy developer. The collaborative agreement focuses on the development and refinement of Sarcos’ autonomous mobile robotic system designed to optimise employee safety and enhance the efficiency of the installation of PV modules for utility-scale solar projects.
“We are extremely optimistic about the use of robots for solar construction to help address the workforce shortages, productivity, and safety challenges that are currently slowing down the progress of U.S. solar initiatives,” said Matt Hadsell, senior manager-innovation and development, Blattner.
Sarcos’ proof-of-concept robotic system consists of an autonomous working vehicle, featuring the company’s Guardian XM robotic arm and an autonomous delivery vehicle. The solution uses cameras to identify where the PV panels need to be installed. The robotic arm then autonomously lifts up the panel using a vacuum system and places it approximately where it needs to be clamped to the mounting structure.
“The arm then goes into a special mode where the person clamping the panel can easily move that panel however they need, in order to align it and attach it into the panels,” Sarcos explains in a video on its website.
The partnership will build upon the Sarcos Outdoor Autonomous Manipulation of Photovoltaic Panels (O-AMPP) project, which is funded through the support of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO). The O-AMPP project started in 2021 and Sarcos expects to commercialise its solution by late 2024.
