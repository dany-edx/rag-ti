In what appears to be an attempt to put a break on development, the Morrison Government is requesting that generators be compelled to provide 18 months more notice of closure.
“If accepted, the rule change will increase notice of closure requirements to 5 years to allow adequate lead time for new capacity to be built,” said Angus Taylor, in a statement, when announcing the move today.
While acknowledging that more notice in principle is a good idea, electricity market analysts have noted that the increased notice requirement is likely to have little material impact and will not delay the accelerating rate of coal-generator retirement.
“In terms of the actual practical implications, it seems limited,” said Ben Cerini, a managing consultant with Cornwall Insight Australia. “Everyone has a pretty good idea that coal will retire earlier and even the system operator agrees that it’s coming earlier. By adding an extra 1.5 years notice, I’m not really sure practically what that achieves.”
The Australia Institute issued a statement noting that the requirement appears to be a reaction by Taylor at having been “left out” of negotiations surrounding the accelerated closure of the 2.9GW Eraring generator – which was announced by Origin in February of this year. Eraring’s closure date was brought forward by 7 years.
“It is abundantly clear that coal plants are going to accelerate their closures, closing faster than their official retirement dates,” said Richie Merzian, the climate and energy program directs at the Australia Institute. “If this government was genuine about providing certainty to coal communities, it would develop a national coal closure roadmap rather than attempting to strong-arm coal plants one by one.”
Cornwall’s Cerini noted that the effectiveness of the extended notice requirement will depend on the penalties attached to a potential violation.
“Even the penalties do outweigh the potential losses [incurred through extended operation], what they are seeking to try to achieve is to keep these plants on for longer. But I can’t imagine the government will step in and run these organizations into forced administration.”
The Australian Energy Council (AEC) has indicated that it will raise this recent rule change with the Energy Security Board, which is already considering such matters. It cast doubt as to whether an extension of notice period is feasible.
“Whilst they may look initially attractive, long firm notice requirements have complex and potentially counterproductive impacts,” said the AEC’s Sarah McNamara, in a statement. “For example, they may force a generator to publish a firm date long before the operational circumstances of the plant are clear. As conditions change, inevitable adjustments will occur, that in turn can lead to a loss of confidence in the information.”

The Mt Marion Lithium site, located 40km south-west of Kalgoorlie in the Goldfields region of Western Australia, underwent an upgrade in 2018-2019 to increase its nameplate capacity to 450,000 tonnes per annum. Under this new agreement, that figure will rise to 600,000 tonnes this month. 
What is more, the joint venture will look to expand that spodumene concentrate capacity to 900,000 tonnes a year by the end of 2022.

The global energy transition has companies and governments looking to invest the raw materials required for battery energy storage, not just for large and small-scale applications but particularly for the enormous uptake in electric vehicles (EVs) predicted to happen this decade. This demand has caused an enormous price spike in lithium, which is extracted from the mineral spodumene. 
“For some time now the world has seen extraordinary demand for lithium, driven by the strength of the electric vehicle market” said MRL managing director Chris Ellison. “This demand has resulted in a substantial increase in lithium prices, with pricing expected to remain strong for the rest of this decade.”
In an announcement to the ASX MRL said the expansion is “in response to unprecedented global customer demand for lithium products” which will see it “increase production from the Wodgina and Mt Marion spodumene mines”. The necessary upgrades will cost less than $120 million.

“With a world-class portfolio of highest-quality, long-life lithium assets in a Tier 1 mining jurisdiction,” continued Ellison, “we are well positioned to capitalise on the continued growth of the global electric vehicle market.”
China is currently the world’s biggest refiner of lithium, controlling about 80% of the market, according to a 2020 study from BloombergNEF. 
In 2019 the lithium market plummeted due to oversupply, but that seems to have only been a false start on widespread EV uptake.

Market intelligence specialist SunWiz said that non-residential battery system deployment was driven by the 450MWh Victorian Big Battery and the 150MWh Wandoan South BESS.
“With more large batteries currently under construction, 2022 is set for another big year,” said SunWiz.
State governments backed big batteries in a number of ways – through the creation of Renewable Energy Zones, power purchase agreements, funding contributions, and direct investment. But there were far fewer announcements of funding for utility-scale systems in 2021 compared to the year before.
However, a number of big batteries were announced in 2021. The announcements came from developers as solar projects started requiring storage, gentailers started looking to replace their coal generation fleets, network owners began addressing grid issues, and miners started taking charge of their power supplies.
SunWiz said the batteries started to increase in duration, with a few announcements of four-hour energy storage indicating that the focus is shifting to bulk energy storage. The residential battery storage market, meanwhile, remained steady in 2021, with 333MWh of systems joining the grid, bringing the cumulative tally in Australia to 2,657MWh.
As state governments backed residential battery storage deployment via rebates and zero-interest loans, Victoria grew to record levels and led the market at the state level, representing 32% of the total installed capacity in Australia. New South Wales came in second and South Australia came third.
Around 8% of all new PV systems installed in 2021 included batteries, down from the peak attachment rate of 12% in 2017, the analysts said. SunWiz has predicted that similar numbers will likely be seen in 2022. This would mean that the Australian market is due for another year of more than 1GWh of new system installations, despite the poor battery pricing outlook.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/07/universitys-own-pv-plant-plays-host-to-study-into-large-scale-solars-impact-on-biodiversity/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BLAKE MATICH,"APRIL 7, 2022",University’s own PV plant plays host to study into large-scale solar’s impact on biodiversity,"Back in 2020 The University of New England (UNE) switched on its very own 3.2MW solar farm with the help of Solgen Energy Group and Aurecon. With an annual generation of approximately 5.2GWh, it is capable of supplying up to 50% of the campus’s energy needs, and much more when the planned energy storage component is added. 
In the meantime, the on-campus solar farm is proving useful in more ways than one. Indeed, UNE lecturer in zoology and ecology Eric Nordberg is utilising the PV plant to ask a very important question, namely, what is the impact of large-scale solar farms on biodiversity? 
Nordberg is conducting a pilot study into this question, specifically looking to learn how renewable energy zones (REZs), can have symbiotic benefits for wildlife as habitats. 
“We know that land-sharing can work” said Nordberg, referring to AgriPV projects, “there are plenty of studies that show the coexistence of biodiversity on grazing landscapes or even crop production under solar panels, however, there are currently no data to show how we can improve these zones to cater for the native wildlife.” 
With his students, Nordberg is surveying the various wildlife found in the UNE solar farm and comparing that with the adjacent fields. This will not only highlight which species are utilising the solar farm as a valuable habitat, but also which species aren’t. The latter data could help promote land management strategies in large-scale solar farm construction that would ensure the preservation of particular habitats.

“For example,” said Nordberg, “new data could show us the need for simple changes such as adding rock piles to encourage rock-dwelling species and increase the amount of cover in solar farms. I’m also interested in looking at ways to improve vegetation management under solar panels, which will have trickle-down effects on wildlife.” 
Nordberg and his students have installed a temporary 30m drift fence trap line in the UNE solar farm, which is, in effect, a long trap interspaced with pitfall buckets dug into the ground. Wildlife funnels in and finds itself trapped in one of the buckets for Nordberg to catalog before release.

Some examples of wildlife already found in and amongst the UNE solar farm include a spotted marsh frog and a Dwyer’s snake.

“Any large-scale land disturbance will have impacts on biodiversity” Nordberg continued, “and we should invest resources to mitigate any negative effects.”
“Solar farms are not really new – there are already thousands of them spread around the world – however, they have slipped between the cracks in terms of ecological monitoring. I think we have a great opportunity to lead this research and put UNE on the map, paving the way in landscape management of renewable energies.” 
Beyond the UNE solar farm, which is proving its value as a teaching tool as much as an independent renewable source of energy, Nordberg wants to expand his research to larger PV plants in the New England Tablelands, as well as facilities in different climates to understand if and how biodiversity’s response to PV plants change. 
“It’s a bit hard to say at this early stage,” said Nordberg, “but ideally, I would love to monitor the progress of recolonisation of wildlife back onto solar farm land over the course of five or more years.” 
“To date, we don’t know how long (or if at all) plants and animals will naturally re-establish onto solar farms without introductions by humans. I suspect that many species will find their way back in, but those are some of the questions I’m interested to find out – what species recolonise and how long does it take?”

Scientists at the US Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have developed an aluminium-nickel (Al-Ni) molten salt battery that, under thermal cycling, exhibits high retention of cell capacity over periods of weeks.
The scientists described the small prototype as a “freeze-thaw battery” that cuts off the self-charge function when a battery is idling. “It’s a lot like growing food in your garden in the spring, putting the extra in a container in your freezer, and then thawing it out for dinner in the winter,” explained researcher Minyuan Miller Li.
The battery is charged by heating it to around 180 C, with its ions flowing through the liquid electrolyte. The device is then restored to room temperature and the electrolyte becomes solid, thus trapping the ions that transport the stored energy.
“The freeze-thaw phenomenon is possible because the battery’s electrolyte is molten salt – a molecular cousin of ordinary table salt. The material is liquid at higher temperatures but solid at room temperature,” the scientists said.
They noted that the battery can be heated again, as the ions restart flowing through the electrolyte when energy is needed. They built it with an aluminium anode and a nickel cathode, immersed in a sea of molten-salt electrolyte.
They added sulfur to the electrolyte to increase the battery’s storage capacity. A ceramic separator was embedded between the anode and the cathode to avoid breakage during the freeze-thaw cycle.
“The PNNL battery uses simple fibreglass, possible because of the battery’s stable chemistry. This cuts costs and makes the battery sturdier when undergoing freeze-thaw cycles,” said the scientists.
They claimed that the battery can retain 92% of its initial capacity over a period of 12 weeks. They said it has a theoretical energy density of 260 W/hours per kg.
“The battery’s energy is stored at a materials cost of about US$23 (AU$30) per kilowatt-hour, measured before a recent jump in the cost of nickel,” they said. “The team is exploring the use of iron, which is less expensive, in hopes of bringing the materials cost down to around US$6 (AU$8) per kilowatt-hour, roughly 15 times less than the materials cost of today’s lithium-ion batteries.
The scientists described the battery in “A freeze-thaw molten salt battery for seasonal storage,” which was recently published in Cell Reports Physical Science.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/07/australias-first-university-set-to-match-100-of-its-energy-with-renewables/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BLAKE MATICH,"APRIL 7, 2022",Australia’s first university set to match 100% of its energy with renewables,"Australia’s oldest university, the University of Sydney (Sydney Uni), has signed a new five-year contract with Snowy Hydro its subsidiary Red Energy to join the likes of the University of Queensland, Macquarie University, Swinburne and Charles Sturt in sourcing “100%” of its electricity in New South Wales (NSW) from renewable sources. 
The contract, which begins from 1 July 2022, will cover all the University’s activities, including campus operations, University-run student accommodation and the various campus colleges. According to Sydney Uni the contact effectively removes 31,200 cars from the road in terms of avoided emissions. 
Sydney Uni vice-chancellor and president Mark Scott, said the shift to renewable electricity reflected the University’s deep commitment to a more sustainable future. 
“We are making the move to 100% renewable electricity three years before our target of 2025,” said Scott. “This agreement will power our research and teaching while reducing emissions. We are delighted to be working together with Snowy Hydro and Red Energy to achieve the ambitious energy targets set out in our sustainability strategy.” 
“We know reducing emissions to combat climate change is a priority for our staff and students and we are committed to embedding sustainability in every aspect of University life,” continued Scott. 
Snowy Hydro managing director and CEO, Paul Broad, welcomed the partnership, noting that “Combining our contracted wind and solar energy with our on-demand hydro assets allows us to provide reliable and 100% renewable electricity to the University.”
100% or true 100%? 
100% renewable energy matching like this deal is a great way for companies and institutions to offset their electricity consumption, but the term “100%” can be misleading. 
Through this contract, power consumed by Sydney Uni will be matched by renewable generation from a NSW solar farm or some other renewable generator. The Large Scale Generation Certificates (LSGCs) that come with the energy generated by this solar facility will then be surrendered by Red Energy at a quantity equivalent to Sydney Uni’s load. 
So, while “100% renewable” implies “0% non-renewable”, that is not in fact the case, and physically can’t be the case until the grid is 100% renewable. Annually, Sydney Uni might have purchased enough LSGCs to offset its consumption, but hour to hour it is still consuming electrons from the grid generated by fossil fuels. To be truly 100% powered by renewables for grid-connected consumers requires 24/7 hourly matching.
That gap between renewables procurement and actual renewables impact on the grid “is taken by 24/7,” said Olivier Corradi, the creator of electricityMap and the CEO of Tomorrow. He argues that 24/7 means that you “can’t report zero if space and time are not matched. And that is a big step, because right now we’re saying that zero is misrepresentative because we don’t have enough granularity.”
Nevertheless, Sydney Uni’s contract with Snowy Hydro and Red Energy is a step on the way to true 100% renewable energy, and should encourage more institutions to seek out such a solution which in turn could drive renewable uptake.  
Sydney Uni has a goal of net zero emissions by 2030.

A white paper published this week by UK analysts Exawatt and Germany’s Nexwafe analyses the current state of PV manufacturing. The study reveals opportunities and challenges for new technologies, particularly Nexwafe’s innovative “Epiwafer” process for the production of silicon wafers.
Nexwafe’s technology does away with the polysilicon production and ingot pulling stages of production, replacing them with a process that grows wafers direct from silicon tetrachloride gas, or the trichlorosilane gas that’s today used as the feedstock for polysilicon production. By cutting these heavy, industrial stages from the PV supply chain the process promises lower manufacturing costs, lower equipment capex and reduced environmental impacts, as well as potentially better quality, thinner wafers able to reach higher efficiencies once processed into cells.
The white paper, which is available for download from Nexwafe’s website, seeks to place this technology within the context of today’s PV manufacturing landscape and evaluate its potential. Nexwafe is currently developing a 500MW demonstration line for its technology in Germany, and last year picked up €39 million ($42.5 million) in an investment round led by India’s Reliance Industries. Despite these successes, the technology still has a way to go to prove itself at scale.
Exawatt finds significant opportunity for this new technology to play off of other developments in PV manufacturing. And it is able to produce wafers at any size, avoiding reported challenges in ingot pulling for the largest 210 mm format.
The process also allows for wafers to be made much thinner than the current ingot/diamond wire saw processing allows. Nexwafe CEO Davor Sutija recently told pv magazine that the company would most likely produce its first wafers at 120 microns, and that it could go much thinner than this later on, if manufacturers are able to improve handling of the thinner, more fragile products in other stages. Exawatt notes that this would offer an advantage or heterojunction cells in particular, where the optimal thickness is 100 microns or even less, while PERC and TOPCon structures work best on a cell between 150 and 200 microns, as can be achieved using the current processes.
Nexwafe’s process also promises lower oxygen content and even dopant distribution – adding up to as much as 1.1% absolute efficiency gain, as well as opening up further possibilities. “In the longer term, the high level of process control afforded by the EpiWafer process could allow for additional techniques to be employed to continue pushing cell efficiencies higher, for example though the incorporation of quantum wells,” states Exawatt.
The recent push for energy security and localised PV supply chains also creates an opportunity for regions outside of China to produce a differentiated production, rather than trying to compete on scale with established industry giants. Exawatt notes that Nexwafe has signed letters of intent with several of the key players looking to establish PV manufacturing outside of China, alongside the investment from Reliance in India.
The biggest remains the scale up from “lab to fab,” with Exawatt warning that the initial 500MW facility in Germany will not be cost competitive with current wafer prices, though this model begins to improve once Nexwafe reaches larger capacities of 3GW and then 6GW.
“From a financial perspective, the key challenge will be to successfully scale up and bridge the gap from lab-scale production to high volume. From a technical perspective, it will be key to demonstrate that the theoretical increases in cell efficiencies afforded by EpiWafers can be realised in practice in cell manufacturing,” the report concludes. If that potential can be realised, the PV industry may yet see another revolution in wafer manufacturing.”
