With this new authorisation, Enel says it will now offer its “greentailer” solution to Australia’s National Energy Market.
To do this, Italian giant – which will draw on its existing Australian arms: Enel Green Power Australia’s renewable generation assets, as well as spinoff Enel X’s technology platforms. The plan for the vertically integrated green energy retailer is continue in the commercial and industrial space, where it has already focussed much attention, saying it will offer up to 100% renewable energy supply at competitive costs.
It will begin approaching C&I customers from December, Enel said. Looking to its future, the company plans to expand into the residential segment as its renewable pipeline grows.
Enel Green Power Australia entered the Australian market in 2017 and currently holds 310 MW of combined capacity through three solar plants, including Bungala One and Two, which together have a capacity of 275 MW, as well as the 34 MW Cohuna Solar Farm in Victoria.
Operating in Australia for even longer though is Enel X, which has been talking to C&I energy users since 2011, forming its VPP from their existing assets — boilers, heat pumps, cooling systems, compressors, manufacturing lines and so on.
It now operates Australia’s largest VPP with more than 350 MW under management.
In October, Enel X declared itself the first registered provider for Australia’s new demand response market, which for the first time gave organisations the capacity to trade their flexible electricity loads on the wholesale electricity market.
Today’s announcement marks a new step for the Italy-based heavyweight taking it into the world of Australia energy retailers which has primarily been dominated by a handful of coal-reliant incumbents.
“Enel X customers are increasingly seeking renewable energy packages to help meet ESG objectives and emissions targets. As a vertically integrated retailer with wholly owned assets, and a global leader in demand response services through complementary digital technology platforms, Enel’s green retail offering will be unique in the marketplace. Leveraging Enel X’s platforms, customers can access new opportunities to decarbonise, digitalise and electrify their energy use,” Enel X’s Head of Asia Pacific Jeff Renaud said.

According to the government, its Destination Charging Across Victoria Program will mean that drivers in any Victorian town will now be only one hour away from a fast-charger, with 141 electric vehicle fast-charging stations being installed across the state.
The destinations of these fast charging stations include shopping complexes, public parks, community centres, libraries, and tourist hot spots such as the Great Ocean Road, Melbourne Zoo, the MCG, and Queen Victoria Market.
The second part of the allocation will go towards “fleet infrastructure” grants for local council’s and business’ EV fleets. The government’s statement gave almost no information about these grants, but on its webpage it notes $1.5 million will go to businesses, with the other $1.5 million for council fleets.
As for terms of the grant, it isn’t clear, though the government page notes the “allocation of the funding will vary depending on the fleet characteristics… including demonstration of need, location, size of fleet, frequency of use and commitment to an EV transition plan.”
Applications for local councils and businesses to apply for fleet charging grants will close on January 22, 2022.
Alongside the funding, Victoria’s Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change, Lily D’Ambrosio, announced the state’s $3,000 zero emission vehicle subsidy will now be available at the point of sale, making access to the rebate significantly easier.
The state’s program also appears to be having the desired effect, with the Victorian government saying it has seen as 200% increase in average monthly EV sales in the six months since the program started. 
“More than 1,500 Victorians have already taken advantage of the subsidy, particularly in the western suburbs, with Point Cook and Truganina among the leading suburbs,” it added.
Victoria is targeting zero emissions vehicles (which seems to be the umbrella term its using so hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles, or FCEVs, can be included in future) to make up half of all new light vehicle sales by 2030.

The lowest prices occur in the middle of the day, due to an abundance of solar energy (particularly rooftop solar). Solar creates a “duck curve” not only in the demand profile, but also in the price profile. This sends a signal for energy storage to soak up excess solar, and discharge the power at more valuable times (such as the evening).
Batteries normally incur a cost when they purchase wholesale energy to charge. However, as can be seen in the Energy Synapse Platform, “charging costs” were a positive revenue line item for the Hornsdale Power Reserve and Lake Bonney battery in South Australia. The 150 MW Hornsdale Power Reserve earned more than $300k from charging over the two months, while the 25 MW Lake Bonney battery earned over $100k.

Negative energy prices were certainly a welcome boost for batteries. However, it is important to note that frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) remain the dominant revenue stream.
As more solar is added to the grid, daytime prices get lower and lower. This places an economic limit on how much solar (without storage) can be deployed in a market.
The Tailem Bend solar farm in South Australia has a modern PPA structure, which requires it to turn down to avoid negative prices. This is known as “economic curtailment”. Tailem Bend was also subject to multiple physical grid constraints, which limited its output. We can see the significant impact this had on the operation of the asset during September in the Energy Synapse Platform. The net result was that the average capacity factor was drastically cut to around 20% in the middle of the day when the natural output of the asset would have been the highest.

Apart from building more big batteries, there is also an opportunity to encourage more demand side resources to “flex up”. This can come from a wide variety of technologies such as hot water systems, residential batteries, and even new industries like green hydrogen.

Malta, developer of electro-thermal energy storage systems, announced its partnership with Bechtel, an engineering, construction and project management firm.
Malta’s system, developed in partnership with Siemens Energy, is energy-source agnostic, able to collect and store energy from solar, wind, or fossil fuels. Its long-duration capability of 10-150+ hours is particularly well-suited to support renewable energy, storing and dispatching power during the intermittent cycles of generation (day to night), and can perform other grid services.
First, energy is gathered, and then moved through a heat pump, converting electrical energy into thermal energy by creating a temperature difference. The heat is stored in molten salt, and the cold is stored in a chilled liquid. When it is time to dispatch the power, the temperature difference is converted back to electrical energy with a heat engine. Finally, it is distributed back to the grid as needed.
“The lack of long-duration energy storage solutions remains a key challenge for the renewable energy industry,” said Bechtel renewables sector lead Scott Austin. “There is no silver bullet for decarbonisation.” A similar sentiment was shared in the pv magazine Roundtables USA 2021 session, where it was discussed that a mix of distributed generation and shorter duration storage with large-scale renewable deployment and long-duration storage would offer the fastest path to decarbonisation.
Malta said its solution has applications in replacing retired fossil-fuel assets like coal-fired power plants, with the ability to reuse existing infrastructure. Additionally, it can be used as an alternative to transmission system updates, also using existing infrastructure, said the company.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/06/record-solar-numbers-expected-this-year-but-iea-highlights-pricing-concern/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,FINANCE,MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",MAX HALL,"DECEMBER 6, 2021",Record solar numbers expected this year but IEA highlights pricing concern,"From pv magazine Global
The latest edition of the Renewables Market Report published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned that if the higher costs which have driven up the price of solar panels this year continue throughout 2022, it could add $70 billion to the PV investment tab over the next five years. That would have been enough to install an additional 95 GW of solar capacity during the period, in terms of the industry’s pre-supply-chain-shock prices, the Paris-based body has calculated.
As usual, the report presents a glass-half-full, glass-half empty appraisal, with the IEA anticipating the world will have installed a record volume of solar this year, spelling out how it would be possible to unlock an additional 25% of renewables plants on top of the huge volumes expected to 2026 … and then pointing out that would still not keep the world on track for net zero in 2050.
The international organisation believes a record, near-160 GW of solar will have been added worldwide this year, with 17% more added than came online in 2020, and predicted the world will be adding 200 GW per year of photovoltaics in five years’ time. Dealing with the familiar list of solar industry grumbles out to 2026 – sluggish permitting, grid integration issues, social acceptance, inconsistent policy, insufficient financial incentives, and costly developing-world finance – could raise that number to almost 260 GW per annum by the time the 2026 numbers are tallied, estimated the IEA.
The report’s authors spell out the sort of effort required to achieve its ‘accelerated case’ outlook for solar: China must define how its renewable portfolio standard – requiring generators to produce a specified volume of clean power – and the green certificates for renewable energy will function, and must support residential arrays after their feed-in tariff (FIT) is wound down this month. Even without those remedies, the IEA said, China will continue to lead the way with 1.2 TW of solar and wind capacity by 2026. That would be enough, wrote IEA executive director Fatih Birol, to ensure the nation “could well achieve a peak in its CO2 emissions well before 2030,” as a government target stipulates.
Elsewhere, to further ramp solar deployment, according to the IEA, the U.S. should extend the investment tax credit for solar; India should get the finances of its power companies in order, extend grids and better incentivise small-scale, ‘distributed-generation‘ arrays; the EU should smooth permitting rules for participation in big solar capacity auctions, and expand the ambition of the procurement rounds, and could also support rooftop systems with its post-Covid recovery and resilience funding; Japan must smooth the transition from FITs to premium payments topping up the wholesale electricity price; and governments in the Middle East and North Africa could hold capacity auctions more often and expand their grids faster.
Even if that perennial wish list remains unfulfilled, the report’s authors stated, the world can be expected to add almost 1.1 TW of solar over the next five years.
In the best of all worlds for solar, however – an ‘accelerated-case’ jamboree of friction-free permitting, bags of cash for rooftop solar, and grids accelerating at a rate of knots – the extra 25% of solar panels that would be installed would still have to double to keep the world on track for net zero in 2050.
And that’s not to mention the IEA’s fear a year of continued high panel prices – driven by more costly polysilicon, steel, copper, aluminium and shipping costs – could wipe out three year’s worth of cost reductions, not to mention the threat of central banks raising interest rates and, thereby, project finance costs, or the plethora of trade measures imposed on solar imports. Those listed in the IEA study ranged from the duty slapped on solar panels by the U.S. in 2022 through to India’s plan to apply a 40% duty on foreign panels and a 25% charge on solar cells, from April.
So the question remains, is our glass half-full or half-empty?
