Powercor electricity networks general manager Mark Clarke said crews had worked at more than 30 sites a week for more than three months, completing more than 500 different network alterations in nine key regions with high levels of rooftop solar penetration.
The areas, identified as part of Powercor’s Solar Hotspots Program, include Ballarat, Bendigo, Bacchus Marsh, Hoppers Crossing, Maryborough, Melton, Portland and the western suburbs of Melbourne between Sunshine and Point Cook.
Clarke said prior to the works, the areas had been among the most constrained parts of its network, with a new solar connections export approval rate of just over 60% at the start of the year.
In the wake of the works program, the areas are now among the best areas for approval of new solar connections to export, with approval rates now above 90% which is even higher than the network-wide average of 89%.
“We’re seeing a real lift in the number of customers able to export excess solar back into the grid in these areas, which were among the most constrained in our network only a few months ago,” Clarke said.
“These works are allowing most of our customers in these areas to export their excess solar, while also supporting Victoria to reduce emissions and increase the use of clean energy generated by customers at home.”

The works program included upgrading infrastructure, adjusting tap settings on street-level transformers, balancing voltage levels on powerlines and making adjustments at zone substations.
The network upgrades are part of stage one of Powercor’s five-year Future Networks program which the service provider said has been designed to better support the rise in rooftop solar, electric vehicles and battery storage.
More than 161,000, or about 22%, of residential customers on the Powercor network now have solar power, with a total installed capacity of 631 MW. In the past 12 months, more than 24,000 new residential customers have connected solar to the Powercor network.
Clarke said the works have not only improved the ability of rooftop solar owners to export solar to the grid but have also reduced the tripping of existing solar systems caused by voltage issues when large amounts of excess solar is exported into the network.
“We recognise the future of energy is being driven by customer choices and these works are part of the ways we’re working to enable them” Clarke said.

Powercor is also stepping up its rollout of community batteries, announcing it will install a 150 kW/388 kWh battery in the western Melbourne suburb of Tarneit to make the most of the strong rooftop solar penetration in the area.
The battery is designed to soak up excess rooftop solar generation and supply up to 150 nearby homes during peak periods, providing more than two-and-a-half hours battery storage.
“This battery will provide benefits for local customers, whether they have solar or not, by providing the community with access to local renewable energy, improving the reliability of electricity during peak demand times,” Clarke said.
“Solar is booming in Tarneit and this battery will allow more homes to connect and export excess solar from their systems back into the grid.”
Tarneit and the surrounding suburbs have the highest number of solar connections in the Powercor network. In the 3029 postcode (Tarneit, Hoppers Crossing and Truganina), more than 13,800 customers have connected solar to the network, making up about 42% of all customers in the area.
It’s expected the new battery, which has secured $800,00 in funding under the Victorian Government’s Neighbourhood Battery Initiative, will enable an additional 121,800 kWh of solar exports per annum in the area.
Construction of the new battery is scheduled to begin this year and it is expected to be operational by June 2022.

“MPower has agreed to purchase two development projects in NSW and Victoria that we will build, own and operate,” MPower CEO Nathan Wise said.
“We’re on the way to our target of 20 projects and are looking forward to ramping up activities as the pipeline continues to build.”
The first of the projects, being developed at Narromine near Dubbo in western New South Wales, is expected to generate more than 14,000 MWh of electricity in its first year.
MPower said the Narromine Renewable Energy Project, developed by Canberra-based ITP Renewables, is expected to be shovel ready within the next three months and revenue generating in early 2023.
The second addition to MPower’s build, own, operate (BOO) portfolio is the Mangalore Renewable Energy Project developed by Tetris Energy approximately 120 kilometres north of Melbourne.
The solar farm, which will connect via a direct feeder into the Ausnet 22 kV system, is expected to produce more than 10,500 MWh of electricity in its first year. It is expected to be shovel ready by the end of 2021 and revenue generating by mid 2023.

It is likely the projects will be coupled with lithium-ion battery storage with MPower announcing earlier this year its intention to augment its portfolio of 5 MW solar farms with 5 MW of DC-coupled battery storage.
“Our build, own, operate solar projects are designed to be battery-ready,” Wise said at the time.
“Project sizing is also being maximised to take into account future battery storage capabilities and benefits.”
MPower said the purchase of the Narromine and Mangalore solar farms will be finalised when each project is fully permitted and has achieved shovel-ready status.
The two purchase agreements are the first for MPower which has ambitions to establish a portfolio of up to 20 renewable energy assets with an aggregate capacity of 100 MW and an estimated end value of more than $150 million.
MPower has a history of designing, constructing, commissioning and maintaining solar farms but Wise said the company is increasingly looking at developing its BOO portfolio, having already secured exclusivity over 10 solar farm development sites across Victoria, South Australia and NSW.
“As the total number of sites secured continues to scale, the company’s focus continues to shift further towards build, own, operate activities,” he said.
“Deploying more of the company’s resources to these initiatives is expected to deliver superior returns and unlock considerable value for shareholders in the longer term. This is the focus for our team now.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/02/aemo-pushes-ahead-with-settlement-reform-for-nem/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 2, 2021",AEMO pushes ahead with settlement reform for NEM,"Owners of fast-response energy generation like batteries are expected to be among the big winners after the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) announced the National Electricity Market (NEM) is ready to operate in accordance with the five-minute settlement (5MS).
First approved by the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) in 2017, the 5MS will shift the current 30-minute wholesale electricity spot market settlement period to five minutes. This will bring the settlement period into line with the dispatch process by which generators are scheduled which has operated on a five-minute basis since the start of the NEM in 1988.
The switch involves changes to metering, settlement, and bidding processes, as well as electricity retail and wholesale market systems.
AEMO said the new settlement period will more accurately reward fast-response energy generation like batteries, which can deliver supply or demand side responses exactly when they are needed by the power system.
The market operator said the 5MS is expected to lead to investment in new technologies such as batteries that can support the increasing amounts of variable renewable energy being deployed in Australia.
It is also expected to encourage and reward consumer participation in the market, both through demand response and virtual power plants (VPPs).
“This is an important market reform that reflects the evolving energy system and an initiative that aligns very closely to AEMO’s priority areas as we navigate the energy future to the benefit of the market and all consumers,” AEMO’s chief market services officer Violette Mouchaileh said.
While the AEMC has approved the introduction of 5MS, it will meet later this month to discuss AEMO’s recommendation and any industry feedback submissions, before making a final determination.
Since the new settlement period was first approved, AEMO has been responsible for updating market procedures, designing and testing systems, and coordinating an industry readiness program.
Mouchaileh said some risks to successful operation of the five-minute market had been noted as part of the readiness assessment but mitigations and contingency plans for these risks have been identified.
“The extensive stakeholder collaboration has been valuable for the decision-making process and program outcomes, and essential for market readiness,” she said.
“Informed by, and completed in consultation with, market participants, AEMO’s comprehensive risk and readiness assessment measured essential criteria required for rule commencement, concluding that the NEM is on track for market start in October.”
A “soft start” of Global Settlement (GS), a framework for the settlement of the wholesale electricity market, is also planned for October.
AEMO said this aligns the development of systems and procedures for both changes, reducing implementation costs. GS will fully commence on May 1, 2022.

Scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have proposed to use silica sands – a stable and inexpensive material with prices ranging from $30 to $50/ton – as a medium to store excess wind and solar power.
The research team developed a thermal energy storage technology called Economic Long-Duration Electricity Storage by Using Low-Cost Thermal Energy Storage and High-Efficiency Power Cycle (ENDURING), which it defines as a scalable solution that can be deployed almost anywhere.
The baseline system, which is designed for a storage capacity of up to 26,000 MWh, works by heating silica particles through an array of electric resistive heating elements at a temperature of around 1,200 degrees Celsius and depositing them on insulated concrete silos for thermal energy storage.
“When energy is needed, the hot particles are gravity-fed through a heat exchanger, heating and pressurising a working gas inside to drive the turbomachinery, and spin generators that create electricity for the grid,” the NREL researchers explained. “Once discharged, the spent, cold particles are once again fed into insulated silos for storage until conditions (and economics) are appropriate again for charging.”
According to them, the proposed storage technology could be deployed at a cost of between $2 and $4 per kWh and it could also be hosted by existing infrastructure from retired coal and gas-fired power plants. Furthermore, it may provide a continuous source of heat for industrial and chemical processes.
“Sand and concrete silos with refractory insulation are very inexpensive materials that can lead to low-cost energy storage,” said NREL researcher Patrick Davenport. “Traditional four-hour storage technologies don’t scale well to the grid or city scale. Now that we are in need of large scale energy storage, this technology makes a lot of sense.”
The prototype heaters and heat exchangers for the proposed system are currently being tested under high temperatures.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/02/novel-battery-chemistry-for-zinc-ion-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SAUDI ARABIA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"SEPTEMBER 2, 2021",Novel battery chemistry for zinc-ion batteries,"From pv magazine Global
Among the many different materials and battery chemistries under investigation to fulfil our growing need for energy storage in various applications, zinc-ion has lagged behind others due to challenges in controlling side reactions that both limit reversible charging at the anode, and cause the cathode to fall apart.
Zinc-ion, however, still has the potential for good energy storage performance out of cheap, abundant materials. And at industrial level, could potentially use many of the manufacturing processes already developed for lithium-ion batteries – making them far easier than other materials to scale up. This has been enough to keep scientists interested in working on zinc-ion battery chemistry, and the latest discovery from a group led by the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia (KAUST), could open up several new doorways for them.
Since a lot of these challenges stem from side reactions involving water-based electrolytes, the group worked with a very high salt concentration, limiting the number of ‘free’ water molecules available to the unwanted reactions. The group designed an electrolyte based on zinc salts mixed with a highly concentrated sodium salt, which serves to both suppress reactions with water and increase conductivity, since the mixed electrolyte dissolved more readily than the zinc-salt by itself. “The supporting salt of NaClO4 can efficiently adjust the solvation structure and electronic states of the electrolyte upon increasing the concentrations,” the group explains. “Therefore, the highly concentrated electrolyte shows the scarcity of free water molecules, low viscosity, and high ionic conductivity, which can efficiently prohibit the dissolution of the NVO cathode to enable remarkable cycling stability and high rate performance.”
One problem with such electrolytes has been finding suitable cathode materials to work with them, and that can be fabricated cost-effectively. The group worked with a sodium-vanadate material, made using a dissolution-crystallisation process at room temperature, and found this showed strong performance in combination with the electrolyte. “The nanofiber morphology enhances ion diffusion, which ensures faster charge and discharge rates of the aqueous Zn-ion batteries,” said Husam Alshareef, who leads the research group at KAUST. “This combination of electrode and electrolyte potentially solves the shortcomings of conventional aqueous Zn-ion batteries.”
The battery is described in the paper Concentrated dual-cation electrolyte strategy for aqueous zinc-ion batteries, published in Energy and Environmental Science. The group notes that previous ‘water in salt’ electrolytes have often relied on toxic substances, and that it has shown that sodium alone can actually show better ionic conductivity than these, as well as lower cost and reduced toxicity. They also note that in analysing the battery’s performance they discovered a new interphase forming at the anode, which promotes uniform, reversible deposition of the zinc ions as the battery cycles.
With further investigation, the group is confident this battery chemistry could be attractive, at least for stationary storage applications where size/weight is not a pressing concern. “The fundamental understanding and the experimental demonstrations of reversible battery chemistry using a bi-cation electrolyte strategy open a viable route to developing aqueous batteries for emerging electrochemical energy storage applications,” they conclude.
