Genex, which has been operating Kidston’s 50 MW solar stage 1 project since 2017, is developing the pumped hydro storage project at the site of two abandoned gold mines near Kidston, about 270km north-west of Townsville. The project is part of a proposed clean energy hub comprising the pumped storage hydro and up to 270 MW of additional solar and up to 150 MW of wind.
Genex CEO James Harding said the new 185.9km transmission line from Kidston to Mt Fox will not only enable the connection of the pumped hydro storage project to the NEM, but with significant spare capacity will unlock the additional stages for the clean energy hub and deliver critical system stability to the grid.

“The transmission line will support not only our flagship Kidston pumped storage hydro project, but the broader Kidston Clean Energy Hub including the Kidston stage 3 wind project and the Kidston stage 2 solar project, with the creation of a new North Queensland Renewable Energy Zone (REZ),” he said.
“This funding is a crucial piece for the overall project financing for the project, which is rapidly advancing toward financial close.”
The funding announcement signals a $15 million increase on the State Government’s original commitment to the project. In 2019 the Government allocated $132 million for the construction of the transmission line and the installation of a new substation at Mt Fox, which will be built, owned and operated by government-owned operator Powerlink.
“Genex is delighted to receive confirmation of the Queensland Government’s $147 million funding package for this critical transmission infrastructure,” Harding said.
“We will continue to update the market as we move through the final approvals and documentation in the coming weeks.”
Harding said the construction of the transmission line and substation, together with the pumped hydro project, will deliver more than 500 new jobs.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/05/rooftop-solar-drives-australia-to-renewable-energy-record/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 5, 2021",Rooftop solar drives Australia to renewable energy record,"The latest figures provided by the CER show an estimated 7.0 GW of renewable energy capacity was installed in Australia last year, 11% higher than the previous record of 6.3 GW set in 2019.
The CER’s Quarterly Carbon Market Report for December 2020, which is expected to be released at the end of February, also shows that a record 53.6 TWh of electricity was generated into the National Electricity Market (NEM) – up 16% from the previous year.
The report also highlights that over the final quarter of 2020 the share of renewables in the NEM exceeded 30%.
Key to that record growth is the nation’s widespread acceptance of rooftop solar PV with the Australian Energy Council’s (AEC) latest Solar Report confirming record growth in solar PV capacity and installations during 2020.
AEC chief executive Sarah McNamara said despite the setbacks triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, Australia’s rooftop solar PV market had been remarkably resilient with an additional 2.6 GW and 333,978 installations added to the grid during the year – both the capacity and installations are about 18% higher than 2019 (2.2GW and 284,000 installations).

McNamara said by the end of 2020 there were more than 2.66 million Australian homes and businesses with solar rooftops. This figure is expected to rise due to the fact that consumers have up to 12 months in which to register their installation.
“Overall, there was a noticeable dip in installations in April 2020 which marks the impact of COVID-19. Since then, the general trend has been for continued growth,” she said.
“New South Wales reported the highest monthly installations, while Queensland took over the second spot from Victoria in the last quarter of 2020.”

New South Wales led the way in 2020, recording a 36% increase in new installed capacity, adding 208 MW to the NEM.
Western Australia also saw remarkable growth, with a 24% increase in new installed capacity, adding 60 MW to Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM), while the number of new installations increased 22%.
The AEC said 2020 also marked a strong year for home battery installations with rooftop solar PV systems. Queensland, which led this trend in 2019 with 32% of market share for the year, was overtaken by South Australia in 2020 which claimed 42% of market share.
While the growth has given rise to some concerns, not least grid security, federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the latest figures cement Australia’s reputation as a renewable energy powerhouse.
Taylor said Australia has the highest uptake of solar in the world with one in four homes using it and the highest wind and solar capacity of any non-European country.
“In 2019, Australia deployed new renewable capacity at least 10 times faster per person than the global average and four times faster per person than China, Europe or the United States,” Mr Taylor said.
“In 2020, Australia invested $7.7 billion or $299 per person in renewable energy. This places us ahead of countries like Canada, Germany, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and the United States on a per-person basis.”
Strong investment in renewables is forecast to continue with Australia projected to deploy an additional 24 GW of rooftop solar by 2030, tripling the nation’s small-scale solar generating capacity over the decade.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/05/australian-first-with-battery-approved-for-hume-hydro-station/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 5, 2021",Australian first with battery approved for Hume hydro station,"Meridian Energy will install the standalone 20 MW lithium-ion BESS alongside the 200 GWh Hume Hydroelectric Power Station after the NSW Department of Planning, Infrastructure and Environment approved the project, the first pairing of its kind in Australia.
Meridian Energy CEO Jason Stein said the project, the first battery and hydro power co-location in Australia, will provide a valuable source of dispatchable generation which will help secure energy supply across the grid.
“We congratulate the NSW Government on amending their Infrastructure State Environmental Planning Policy to include standalone battery storage projects such as this and we are pleased to be part of the first project to be given approval under the updated policy,” he said.
The Hume hydro power station is located at the Hume Dam, about 20km upstream from Albury-Wodonga on the NSW/Victoria border and produces approximately 203 GWh of renewable energy each year.
Meridian confirmed the hydro power station has restrictions on the amount of water it can discharge to generate energy and said the proposed BESS will capture energy generated during low demand periods and dispatch this stored energy into the grid when demand increases. Figures published by Meridian suggest the BESS will increase the capacity of the existing hydro power station by 30-35%.
The new battery will be connected to the existing substation via underground cables with electricity transferred to NSW (via Albury) and Victoria (via Wodonga) utilising existing transmission lines.
Stein said the 20 MW/40 MWh battery will not only improve the stability of the grid but will also future proof the hydro power station which was first commissioned in 1957, ensuring it will remain online and in service well into the future.
“Once completed the battery paired with an existing hydro generator … will mean the Hume Power Station can remain online to supply clean, reliable and importantly dispatchable power to meet Australia’s future energy needs,” he said.
“The proposed battery will supply clean, reliable and affordable energy to our customers as well as create jobs for the community.”
NSW Environment minister Matt Kean says the development will add to NSW’s renewable energy mix.
“As renewable energy becomes a greater part of our energy mix, projects like this will help to support the continued growth of our economy by delivering a modern, cheap and reliable energy grid for the people of NSW,” he said.
The project is expected to be completed in December 2021 with Meridian estimating it will contribute $32 million in regional investment and provide more than 50 construction jobs in the region.
The announcement comes less than 24 hours after Cep Energy announced plans for a 1.2 GW megabattery to be installed in the Hunter region of NSW.
CEP Energy announced on Thursday it had signed a 30-year lease agreement with the Hunter Investment Corporation to build a grid-scale battery at Kurri Kurri.
The CEP Energy megabattery joins a growing list of big batteries announced in recent months.
Origin Energy plans to build a 700 MW battery at the site of its Eraring coal generator, also in the NSW Hunter region, while Neoen has filed plans to build a 500 MW big battery west of Sydney, in addition to the 300 MW big battery it is on the verge of constructing outside Geelong in Victoria.
AGL is also busy in the battery storage sector with plans to build a 200 MW grid-scale battery in Victoria’s La Trobe Valley and a 250 MW battery at the site of its Torrens Island Power Station in South Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/05/sungrow-launches-second-generation-inverter-in-australia/,"INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 5, 2021",Sungrow launches second generation inverter in Australia,"Since launching into the Australian market in 2012 solar inverter manufacturer Sungrow has established itself as a major player in the residential sector and it is now looking to stake a stronger claim in the segment with the launch of its range of SG inverters.
The Gen-2 three-phase inverter line-up includes five variants – 5 kW, 7 kW, 10 kW, 15 kW and 20 kW. The range includes Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI), real-time monitoring, a wide MPPT voltage range and a fully compliant built-in DC Switch which the manufacturers claim “enables easier installation and significant cost-savings”.
Efficiency is reasonable with a rate of 97.40% and a maximum of 98.40% for the SG5.0RT unit ranging up to 98.10% with a maximum of 98.50% for the SG20RT model. It is worth noting the rates included on the data sheet are the European weighted efficiency rates.
The inverters’ 16 A input current and 25 A short circuit current should satisfy most residential installations while the start-up and MPPT voltage range (180 v – 1000 v) is notable with Sungrow indicating it will translate to higher system yield.
Also worth noting is that it is possible to connect an uneven amount of strings to the MPPT trackers on the SG7.0RT and SG10RT models which will provide for flexibility. The THD (<3% at nominal power) and power factor (>0.99/0.8 leading 0.8 lagging) are just as they are for most other inverters.
The Gen-2 inverters come with a comprehensive list of protection mechanisms including an AFCI which Sungrow says substantially reduces the risk of electrical fires. They also include Smart IV Scan and real-time monitoring for quick fault location and troubleshooting, built-in Type II DC and AC surge protection, DC reverse connection protection, AC short-circuit protection and current leakage protection.
The inverters weigh in from 18-21kg and measure 370mm wide, 480mm high and 195mm deep.
As far as warranty on the SG range, Sungrow offers coverage for defects in materials and workmanship for a period of 10 years from the date of installation, but no more than 11 years from the manufacturing date.
The release of the new SG inverters continues Sungrow’s push into the Australian market after an impressive performance in 2020.
In an interview with pv magazine last month, Sungrow Australia country manager Joe Zhou said 2020 had been a “highly successful year” with the company’s market share in the residential segment growing to 20%-22%.
Zhou said Sungrow is now aiming to build on that success and also expects to make inroads into the commercial and utility-scale markets and also has its sights set on the battery energy storage landscape.
“Our target for 2021 is to grow our market share in the residential segment to more than 25% and get a stronger foothold in the commercial segment,” he said.
“Sungrow has deployed more than 450 MW of inverters in the Australian residential segment for 2020 and … we expect to make a bang in 2021 with our deployments in C&I and utility projects.”

According to a company statement, CEP.Energy signed a new 30-year lease agreement with the Hunter Investment Corporation to build a grid-scale battery with capacity up to 1,200 MW within the HEZ precinct at Kurri Kurri. 
The battery would be the largest of four planned utility-scale batteries CEP.Energy is planning throughout Australia. The total planned portfolio reaching a capacity of 2 GW. 
According to CEP.Energy CEO Peter Wright, the proposed Hunter Big Battery is eight times the size of the Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia (SA). And if everything goes to plans, and that is a lot of things, CEP.Energy would be well on its way to becoming Australia’s largest battery storage asset owner. 
“CEP’s grid-scale battery network is part of our dual-track strategy to generate and store clean, reliable and cost-effective electricity for Australian businesses,” said Wright, “and make excess power available to the national grid to firm up the increase in renewable generation.”
By 2025, CEP.Energy’s plan is to have 1.5 GW of solar and 1 GW of battery energy storage providing a steady flow of low-cost energy for tenants of some 10 property-portfolio partners via microgrids and virtual power plants distributed across industrial and retail rooftops in SA, NSW, Victoria and Queensland. 
Wright says that the fund has already secured strategic locations with excellent network connectivity infrastructure. Of course, the strategic location of the Hunter battery is the HEZ site, which already holds approvals for major works and is adjacent to existing sub-stations. “It is among the best handful of sites in Australia for reliable and efficient grid connection,” Wright added. 
Chaired by former New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma, the fund’s executives include Marjorie Maydwell (ex Energy Australia and AusGrid) as Head of Embedded Networks, Dan Lowenthal (coming from senior roles in Schletter Australia, DECMIL and SunEdison) as Head of Installations, Jan-Adrian Muller (ex Tesla C&I Project Development in Australia) as Business Development Manager, and Peter Wright, a former executive of Macquarie Bank, as CEO.
Speaking on the planned Hunter megabattery, Iemma said integrated grid-scale battery networks are accelerating Australia’s transition to a clean energy future. 
Iemma stressed the important role big batteries will play in covering the gaps left by coal and gas retirements, such as the nearby Liddell Power Station. 
Indeed, the Energy Security Board’s (ESB) Post 2025 Market Design Directions Paper released last month states that the massive influx of new renewable energy over the next two decades will need to be supported by between 6-19 GW of new flexible and dispatchable resources. 
“The clean energy roadmap laid out by the NSW Government has provided the market with the confidence to invest in renewable generation supported by large battery storage,” continued Iemma. “This project will help ensure the Hunter region of NSW remains true to its heritage as one of the nation’s energy powerhouses as we work towards a cleaner, decarbonised future.”
The race that stores the nation
The CEP.Energy megabattery joins a growing list of megabatteries announced in recent months. There is a race on in the energy industry and unlike the Melbourne Cup it is not a race that stops the nation, but a race that stores the nation. Only last month Origin Energy’s announced that it planned to build a 700 MW battery at the site of its Eraring coal generator also in the NSW Hunter region.  Throw in French renewables giant (and owner of Hornsdale Power Reserve) Neoen filed planned 500 MW / 1000 MWh big battery to be built west of Sydney, in addition to the 300 MW / 450 MWh Victoria Big Battery it is on the verge of constructing outside Geelong, as well as securing a 14-year contract with the Australian Capital Territory.
But let’s not forget AGL, another of Australia’s largest and longest-serving polluters, which is also making rapid headway toward its goal of 850 MW of new large-scale battery storage in its portfolio by FY 2024. AGL has already announced a 200 MW large grid-scale battery project based at Loy Yang in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, and a 250 MW, four-hour duration battery system in development at the site of its Torrens Island Power station in South Australia. 
CEP.Energy’s Chief Strategy Advisor, Mark Stedwell, previously GM Real Time Operations and Systems Capability at the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), has said that the reliable battery storage is a pathway to greater levels of variable renewables. Hence, “There is clearly scope for more big battery projects that stack up in terms of location and a sustainable business model.” 
Big Battery VPP
CEP.Energy has a dual trajectory planned for its battery battery portfolio, what it calls its “dual-track strategy”. Simultaneous with the development of its 2 GW utility-scale storage plans the green fund will also look to progress its aggregated Virtual Power Plant (VPP), the product of 1.5 GW of C&I rooftop solar. 
CEP.Energy will pursue the development of the Hunter Big Battery in stages, with Wright saying that an expression of interest (EOI) period will be issued imminently to find the right battery provider. 
The current estimate is that construction on the project will begin in Q1 2022 with hopes of being operational in 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/05/woodmac-calls-for-investment-in-grid-flexibility-through-more-ambitious-ret/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"FEBRUARY 5, 2021",WoodMac calls for investment in grid flexibility through more ambitious RET,"Wood Mackenzie (WoodMac) has called on the Australian Government to implement a much more ambitious Renewable Energy Target (RET), arguing Australia needs a revised RET to unlock US$40 billion in opportunities in the energy sector. 
Rishab Shrestha, a senior analyst at WoodMac, said “Australia does not have a federal long-term national power mix target like many other countries. The RET scheme, alongside government funding, have led to the renewables boom over the last few years. Hardware cost declines have continued to be a precursor for growth. But the grid has been pushed to its limit making future renewable cash flows difficult to ascertain and stifling growth.”
According to the Clean Energy Council (CEC), the RET is a Federal policy to “designed to ensure that at least 33,000 GWh of Australia’s electricity comes from renewable sources by 2020. It is composed of two components, the large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET), and the small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES). 
The LRET’s 2020 targets were met as early as September 2019, though the Government is still issuing large-scale generation certificates (LGCs) created by large-scale generators and sold to large-scale users. Meanwhile, the SRES, which expires in 2030, continues to provide financial incentives (thought subsidy is continuously decreasing) for individuals, households and businesses to install small-scale systems such as rooftop solar. According to the CEC: “As more renewable energy is produced beyond the 33,000 GWh target, the number of LGCs generated will continue to increase, leading to an oversupply in the market that will significantly reduce their value.” 
Shrestha is similarly concerned, and believes the key to unlocking the enormous investment opportunity an expanded RET would attract is to invest strongly in grid flexibility now. “There is definitely room to achieve more renewables penetration with a more ambitious target for the RET scheme, but the potential needs to be unlocked through grid flexibility investments. A coordinated federal push would be effective.”

WoodMac thus argues that we are at a pivotal juncture in the energy transition. Either we invest ambitiously in grid flexibility to all more renewables to come online, or tomorrow when the coal-fired power stations retire we’ll be left with a whole lot of stranded assets. 
“Coal retirements will be challenging due to its important role in providing low-cost baseload power,” continued Shrestha, “Over 40% or around 10 GW of the existing coal fleet in the National Electricity Market (NEM) is expected to retire over the next two decades. But realistically, we think significant retirement of coal capacity will only start from the early 2030s.” 
By 2030, WoodMac predicts coal’s primacy in the generation mix will fall from 55% to 47%, with gas contributing 10%. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) disagrees with this expectation of gas, saying that it is all hot air and that gas will only contribute a 1% share of the generation mix in 2030. 
Shrestha suggests AEMO’s Integrated System Plan (ISP), which sets out gas’s 1% stake, would “remove critical balancing capacity from the grid system and make renewables integration more challenging.” 
However, is big battery storage projects come online throughout the next decade at the same rate at which they are being announced, the utility of gas would be significantly diminished. Nevertheless, gas would remain in the NEM “to provide multi-day or even multi-month backup. In the event of a large plant or transmission line outage, a system relying heavily on renewables and storage looks fragile. More storage is needed, but it will not solve all the problems which are causing a slow-down in wind and solar investments in Australia.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/05/what-role-will-battery-storage-have-in-bidens-america/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",PV MAGAZINE,"FEBRUARY 5, 2021",What role will battery storage have in Biden’s America?,"From pv magazine USA
Anyone who followed last week’s confirmation hearing for Jennifer Granholm to become secretary of energy, will remember that a hefty portion of the hearing focused on the United States’ place in the electric vehicle (EV) marketplace, and in the battery world overall.
(Read our coverage of the hearing.)
Energy and battery storage are set to be the lynchpin of a transition to a carbon-free economy and greater adoption of renewable energy. Even so, most experts say that the U.S. is significantly behind much of the world in usage and manufacturing. This reality will need to be quickly addressed by the Biden administration. pv magazine spoke with Kurt “Chip” Breitenkamp, vice president of business development at NanoGraf, who offered insight into how the administration might tackle the battery and storage challenge.
Already, the Biden administration has created significant battery and EV demand through the “Made in America” executive order signed in late January. The order directs the federal government to replace its entire existing vehicle fleet with EVs.
“If we believe that electrification is going to be the future of the new green economy, we can’t be reliant on other countries,” said Breitenkamp. “I think we learned that lesson from fossil fuels over the last 50 years.”
Breitenkamp said that the demand created by the federal government will create upstream demand for batteries and the materials used to construct them. That, in turn, will create a much more dynamic American battery market. From there, the hope is that corporations and other entities will recognise the capacity of battery manufacturing and look to invest still further in the technologies.
The biggest challenge to achieving this reality is the middle part of the “smiling curve”: manufacturing and production capacity. While a major focus of research and development is on battery technologies and massive potential demand exists for these technologies, domestic manufacturing capacity is virtually non-existent.
“There isn’t a single U.S. company that can make a state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery right now,” said Breitenkamp.
Making those batteries requires the supplies to go with them, and that means developing an American battery production supply chain.
One of the biggest issues involves cobalt, which primarily is sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and has a dubious supply chain. But Breitenkamp asserts that this may not be the most difficult obstacle to hurdle.
Instead, he said that battery manufacturers are increasingly moving their chemistries away from cobalt. If the United States were able to set up an effective market for battery and electronic recycling, that would greatly reduce the country’s reliance on new, mined cobalt. To date, battery recycling has been underdeveloped but the potential for greater expansion exists, according to Breitenkamp.
He cited the opinion of JB Straubel, co-founder and former CTO of Tesla and now CEO of Redwood Materials, who said that thousands of tons of cobalt exist already in the U.S. in the form of unused electronics.
“The reality is that China has shipped us enough cobalt in the form of finished products that, if we recycle that, we might have enough cobalt without having to worry about that being part of the U.S. supply chain,” Breitenkamp said.
As for nickel, graphite, and lithium, the United States may have to turn to Canada and countries in South America, where the resources are plentiful. For example, considerable nickel and graphite resources exist in Canada, which is especially important given that China historically has dominated graphite production. As for lithium, the resource is plentiful in South America, especially in Chile.
Breitenkamp raised the idea of a trade treaty, similar to the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement, that the United States could pursue with Canada and South American lithium-producing countries to create a resilient and equitable supply chain.
As important as the raw materials are to create a battery, job creation is at the forefront of Biden’s energy policy.
In her hearing, Granholm shared the goal of creating 10 million jobs focused on transforming energy systems. A major challenge will be retraining former fossil fuel workers in the new energy economy. Any transition cannot be equitable if these workers are left behind, the administration has argued.
“We have technologies that are ready now, we have jobs that are ready now,” said Breitenkamp. He said a key challenge is creating enough demand to further develop clean energy solutions like batteries and energy storage. “If it were easy, we would have already figured it out.”
