https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/10/independent-review-finds-australias-carbon-credit-scheme-sound/,"HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 10, 2023",Independent review finds Australia’s criticised carbon credit scheme ‘sound’,"Led by Australia’s former Chief Scientist Professor Ian Chubb, the independent review of Australia’s carbon credit scheme concluded that the Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCU) scheme is “essentially sound,” but recommended an overhaul of the scheme’s governance structure. The review panel did not second criticisms lobbed at the scheme’s “methods” for abating carbon.
The review was sparked in 2022 following claims from Australian National University (ANU) Professor Andrew Macintosh that the most prominent methods for creating carbon credits (which should represent one tonne of abated carbon) amounted to a “fraud.”
Chubb’s six-month review has not come to the same conclusion, with the review panel suggesting a lack of transparency around the scheme has led to such “polar-opposite views.” However, the review panel did make three recommendations surrounding the scheme’s most controversial methodologies. 
Review recommendations 
Firstly, the review recommended greater oversight for projects using the human-induced regeneration (HIR) method, saying it must be “reasonable to expect that the project area will become native forest, attain forest cover.”
The HIR method came under scrutiny from Macintosh and others who claimed forest regrowth has little to do with “human-induced” activities, and mostly depends on natural rainfall.
More radically, the review recommended no new project registrations be allowed under the current avoided deforestation method. This method came under intense scrutiny after research from the Australia Institute revealed credits awarded for “avoided deforestation” were issued based on land clearing rates between 751% and 12,804% higher than anything seen on the ground.
Finally, the review recommended landfill gas methods should incorporate upward sloping baselines. Baselines have been an ongoing source of contention for this method, with older projects sometimes given baselines as low as 0%.
Reaction
Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the government would implement all 16 of the review panel’s recommendations.
Since the findings were released, Macintosh and colleague Professor Don Butler claimed the review falls short.
The pair’s concerns were also held by Glenn Walker, head of advocacy and strategy at Greenpeace Australia Pacific.
“I find it really perplexing that the Chubb review would come out and essentially say ‘there’s no problems’ yet we still need to come out and have all these governance and transparency reforms,'” Walker told pv magazine Australia, before adding, “It’s pretty contradictory findings and messaging.”
If Australia’s carbon credit scheme is not of high integrity it would spell major problems for the Albanese government reaching its 43% emissions reduction target by 2030. To reach that goal, Labor needs its carbon credit scheme to be trusted, as the scheme underpins the Safeguard Mechanism. 
Australia’s Safeguard Mechanism aims to cut the emissions from the country’s largest emitters and most intensive industries. Like the carbon credit scheme, it has come under intense criticism in the last year.
Federal Energy and Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen has now announced his government’s reform package for the Safeguard Mechanism, which requires significantly greater emissions reductions than required by the former Coalition government.

Specifically, the mechanism makes it compulsory for 215 facilities producing more than 100,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases a year to offset their emissions. Since Labor’s election, it has been consulting to reform the Coalition-introduced policy – a strategy which took on new weight after the integrity of Australia’s carbon credit scheme, on which the Safeguard Mechanism heavily relies, came under scrutiny in 2022.
Under Labor’s reform package, the top polluting facilities will be required to reduce their emissions by 28% by 2030, amounting to a 4.9% yearly reduction for the next seven years.

To help “trade exposed” facilities reach this benchmark, the federal government will release $600 million (USD 414 million) from its $1.9 billion Powering the Regions Fund.
As part of the package, the government is also proposing a $75 cap on the price of Australian carbon credits – which underpin the Safeguard Mechanism as polluting facilities are required to use the credits to “offset” their emissions. The results of an independent review into Australia’s carbon credits scheme concluded it was not fundamentally flawed, but recommended a series of governance and transparency changes.
Under the Safeguard Mechanism, Bowen said each polluting facility’s emissions “baseline” will continue to be site specific, before the government moves towards more uniform industry baselines by 2030. The government will also continue to set baselines according to emissions intensity, rather than actual emissions, meaning the limit can rise and fall according to a facility’s total production.
Slated to come into effect on 1 July 2022, Labor’s reform package will now be debated – though, as Greenpeace’s Glenn Walker explains, the setup of the Safeguard Mechanism as primarily a form of regulation rather than legislation means this process is somewhat unusual.
“The vast majority of the changes are just something the minister can sign off on,” Walker tells pv magazine Australia. Some elements of the policy, like how the Safeguard Mechanism credits work, require legislative changes, “but the rest of the policy – all the details that were released today – are simply Chris Bowen signing off on changes.” 
Walker noted that these “can be disallowed in the parliament, but they are not something, say, the cross bench can put amendments up for. So it’s going to be really interesting to see how this plays out politically, because there isn’t the same leeway to seek specific amendments as there is with other forms of legislation.”
While Walker says the reform package would mark a substantial improvement on how the Safeguard Mechanism is enacted, he doesn’t think the Labor government’s reforms go far enough.
Walker sees two main problems with the Safeguard Mechanism. Firstly, the unfettered use of offsets, which he says creates license to continue polluting.
And secondly the lingering questions around the actual integrity of these offsets, which take the form of Australian carbon credits or ACCUs.
Walker described himself as “disappointed” by the  independent review of Australia’s carbon credit scheme – which he felt largely ignored problems of methodology in the creation of carbon credits.
Walker believes the use of carbon credit offsets should be capped, and coal, oil and gas companies should be barred from using these credits altogether. Moreover, Walker doesn’t believe fossil fuel companies should be allowed any access to the $600 million the government has offered to help facilities reach their new baselines.
More generous caps for industries “which have a future,” such as cement and aluminium industries, should be offered by the government, Walker says.

Work has commenced on the first two fit outs, at Broadmeadows Central in Victoria, and Lake Haven Centre in New South Wales. The projects have a combined capacity of over 5 MWh and are due for completion by mid-2023.
The batteries – the make and chemistries of which have not been made public – will be linked to Enel X’s virtual power plant (VPP) program, allowing them to play on wholesale energy markets and services markets.
Following the first two battery projects, the companies say there will be an opportunity to expand across the centres in Vicinity’s nationwide portfolio, potentially deploying more than 50 MWh of battery storage nationwide.
Vicinity launched its renewable energy strategy back in 2018, dedicating $73.2 million to its commercial solar rollout. Said to be Australia’s largest commercial solar program, its projects include Australia’s largest solar carpark, the deployment of ClearVue’s solar glass, and as of 2021 boasted a total of 25.2 MW of solar capacity across 20 sites.

The company also uses automated demand management processes and says it is on track to reach a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2030 across it 32 wholly-owned assets.
The Enel X partnership is not Vicinity’s first foray into batteries though, with the company in 2019 trialling a 548 kWh Sungrow-Samsung battery at Castle Plaza in South Australia. The system was coupled with 2 MW of rooftop solar, as was primarily used for peak load shaving and shifting, as well as system firming.

On the other hand, the Enel X joint venture seems to have a heavy focus on using the solar-coupled batteries to generate returns through energy trading – though presumably solar shifting continues to play a role.
Under the joint venture, Enel X is responsible for procuring, operating and optimising the batteries to generate the most value from the energy markets, while Vicinity manages the engineering, procurement and construction process along with providing access to its infrastructure.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/10/four-global-trends-in-solar-and-storage-in-2023/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 10, 2023",Four global trends in solar and storage in 2023,"From pv magazine USA
Each year, IHS Markit, an S&P Global Company, offers 10 trends in cleantech for the year. This year, solar and energy storage-related stories dominated the list. Below are four top trends in solar and storage in 2022.
Distributed generation 45% of new additions
Distributed generation (DG), defined by IHS Markit as PV systems below 5 MW, was estimated to grow by 20% in 2022. The segment continues to demonstrate strong resilience through the pandemic and a challenging high-cost environment.
While many projects at the utility-scale were delayed or cancelled over the last two years, distributed generation did not lose traction. “This difference reflects both the DG policy push of individual markets and many consumers’ concerns over high electricity prices and the climate footprint,” said IHS Markit.
About 60% of the DG growth occurred in China and Germany, where both markets are pursuing policies to make DG a central part of renewables targets. Brazil is another high-profile DG market, as net-metering systems installed through 2023 remain exempt from grid charges. Conversely, the segment may recede considerably this year in the United States, as net metering is stripped from many major state markets.
“Even at higher capex levels, DG systems generate electricity that remains competitive with retail electricity prices across many markets, meaning the DG segment is less price sensitive than utility-scale PV,” said IHS Markit.
Renewables grow despite capex increases
Despite higher-than-expected capital expenditures in 2022, a new paradigm of renewables growth emerged. Renewables are already the cheapest source of new power generation globally, and cost declines due to technology evolutions and policy advancements have triggered further capacity additions and price drops.
In solar, investors have come to expect continuously lower capital expenditures, but as the technology has matured, capex is declining at a slower rate. This combined with supply chain hurdles and rising shipping and materials costs led to a higher-than-expected capex of solar projects this year.
As the penetration of renewables increases, the focus is not so much on the cost, but on the value provided to the system. IHS Markit said, “In a moment of high volatility, the predictability in operating renewables is valued.”
Investors also value investments in renewables as a measure to meet climate commitments and de-risk portfolios. IHS Markit said consolidation in renewables banking alongside a strong push for green financing has brought down the cost of capital for renewable power projects. Recent volatility and spikes in electricity prices have improved the captured prices for renewables.
“These perceived values counterbalance the industry’s higher-than-expected capex and underpin the continued build-out of new renewables capacity,” said IHS Markit.
Manufacturing closer to end market
Supply chain woes, trade barriers, and geopolitics have been driving PV manufacturing capacity closer to the end-user. IHS Markit said supply chain tightness may persist for some time, but there are some positive developments easing this, including: 
Announcements of new ingot, wafer, cell, and module capacity in India, the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asian countries will continue in 2023 as the supply chain continues growing and adapting to the new international trade environment.
Energy storage system costs rise 
Lithium-ion batteries have reversed their trend of lowering in cost, rising about 15% in late 2021. A surge of raw materials prices across the board pushed prices higher in 2022. Cost increases are primarily for lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) batteries, which is favoured for the grid-scale storage segment and is in-demand for the EV segment as well.
Price declines may not resume until 2024, said IHS Markit, and this is subject to LFP manufacturers quickly scaling up and energy storage integrators securing supply agreements with a wider range of providers not captured by EV demand.
“Nonetheless, battery energy storage costs remain competitive with the alternative technologies. The bigger threat to growth is the ability of system integrators to procure the required volumes of batteries,” said IHS Markit.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/10/photocatalytic-water-splitting-with-9-2-solar-to-hydrogen-efficiency/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"JANUARY 10, 2023",Photocatalytic water splitting with 9.2% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency,"From pv magazine Global
University of Michigan researchers developed a new photocatalytic water splitting system that is reportedly able to reach a 9.2% solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency.
The proposed system uses the higher energy part of the solar spectrum to split water and the lower part of the spectrum to provide heat that encourages the reaction. The extra heat also allows the hydrogen and oxygen to remain separate, rather than renewing their bonds and forming water once more.
It works in an indoor environment and uses pure water, concentrated solar light, and an indium gallium nitride photocatalyst. The semiconductor catalyst, a forest of nanowires of indium gallium nitride grown onto a silicon surface, is able to become more efficient during use, according to the scientists. The device absorbs photons and converts them into electrons, which are used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.
The nanowires are peppered with nanoscale balls of metal, 1/2000th of a millimetre across, that use those electrons and holes, positively charged gaps left behind when electrons are liberated by the light, to help direct the reaction.
“A simple insulating layer atop the panel keeps the temperature at a toasty 75 C, or 167 F – warm enough to help encourage the reaction while also being cool enough for the semiconductor catalyst to perform well,” the scientists said.
They claim that the system is nearly 10 times more efficient than other solar water-splitting systems of the same kind. They said that the final cost of hydrogen could fall with a bigger semiconductor.
“We reduced the size of the semiconductor by more than 100 times compared to some semiconductors only working at low light intensity,” said researcher Peng Zhou.
The research group described the system in the study “Solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of more than 9% in photocatalytic water splitting,” published in Nature.
“This temperature-dependent strategy also leads to an STH efficiency of about 7 % from widely available tap water and sea water and an STH efficiency of 6.2% in a large-scale photocatalytic water-splitting system with a natural solar light capacity of 257 watts,” they said.
They claimed that the next challenge is to further improve the efficiency and generate ultra-high purity hydrogen that can be directly fed into fuel cells.
