California shows it’s possible to pick up the pace,"Plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) accounted for 16% of new light-duty vehicle sales in California in the first half of 2022. In Australia, EV sales are only 2% of the market, and mostly from one carmaker, Tesla.
Australia, a country with no vehicle fuel economy or CO₂ emissions regulations, is debating how to move forward. The local auto industry suggests Australia needs a slow transition to EVs and should lag the United States, Europe, China and neighbouring New Zealand. Compared to proposed European vehicle emission standards of 43 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre in 2030, the local industry proposes 98-143g CO₂/km (for light cars and SUVs).
The proposed Australian target would result in a slow transition, which new research suggests will have little or no effect on the transport sector’s CO₂ emissions.
The rationale for a slow transition is the same as was heard for decades in California: EV prices are too high, there isn’t enough infrastructure to support these vehicles, their driving ranges are too short, and certain models aren’t available (electric utes, for example).

These concerns have some validity, but are largely out of date. Australia in 2022 faces a very different situation from California when it started down the electric vehicle path.
Let’s deal with why each of these four concerns might now be overstated.
Drivers in both Australia and California travel similar distances per year. In both regions, most trips are well within EV range.
Further, in both regions most households own two vehicles. This means buyers can, if needed, use another vehicle for longer trips.
Electric vehicle range has also improved: the average range of available electric vehicles in 2013 when electric vehicle sales in California reached Australia’s current level of 2% was 179 kilometres (111 miles). Now, it’s 443 kilometres.

In California and other markets like Norway, most early electric vehicle buyers charge at home on their driveway or in a garage. In Australia even more people live in a detached house than in California. Drivers in these households could charge their vehicle at home, which reduces the need for public charging stations.
Public charging may be needed to support occasional charging, to enable longer journeys and to support the smaller proportion of households without home charging. But public infrastructure is not a prerequisite for early market growth.
Australia already has as many charging stations per person as California had in 2016. In fact, Australia might be only a few years behind.

In Australia the average new car is $40,729 (US$28,000). EVs with ranges of around 400km could be made available at that price.
For example, the 2023 Chevrolet Bolt starts at US$25,600 ($37,000) in the US. And until 2020 the Renault ZOE was sold in Australia for $37,400. Both models have a range of about 400km.
Consumers have also been shown to be willing to pay more for an EV compared to a conventional vehicle. This might be partly due to the savings on fuel and maintenance costs.
In 2022, 316 electric and 162 plug-in hybrid models are on sale globally. These models include SUVs, utes and pick-up trucks.
 
The lack of choice and of lower-cost EVs in Australia is because carmakers prefer to send these models to markets with supportive electric vehicle policies . Making these models available in Australia may be as simple as giving carmakers the motivation to sell them there.
Australia may be well positioned for a rapid transition to EVs if it adopts more supportive policies. If Australia brings in policies such as ambitious fuel-economy standards or a zero-emission-vehicle sales mandate, the country could benefit in the same ways as California did.

Supportive policies like these help set the stage for the early electric vehicle market to grow. They do this by:
An EV mandate can also protect consumers from supply ebbs and flows that are common in import-only markets.
Australia is not the first nation to grapple with these challenges. South Korea, despite being a global producer of EVs, was experiencing slow domestic market growth. Many Korean EVs were exported to regions with policies more friendly to the technology.
The government responded with policies to support EVs. Since then, domestic sales have tripled. South Korea is now the seventh-largest EV market in the world, up from 11th in 2019.
And as federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen noted at the EV Summit last month, with the right policy settings, Sweden increased its proportion of electric vehicle sales from 18% to 62% in just two years.

Similar approaches could yield similar results for Australia. While some nations may need a slower transition for a variety of reasons, Australia need not be one of them. Concerns about range, infrastructure and model availability can be readily overcome.
The country is well placed for early market growth. All states already offer incentives for EV buyers, including rebates, registration discounts and road tax exemptions.
All that may be needed is for the federal government to adopt policies that support electric vehicles. Based on the remarkable improvements in the technology and what has been learned in California and elsewhere, Australia is well placed for rapid market growth.

Founded in 2008, SolarZero has established itself as a leading provider of rooftop solar and smart battery energy storage systems in New Zealand, claiming a 40% market share of new residential rooftop installs.
The company has installed approximately 8,500 rooftop solar PV systems across the residential, commercial, and community sectors, linking them using its proprietary smart battery and energy management platform to build what is said is the largest virtual power plant (VPP) in the Asia-Pacific region.
SolarZero said the VPP currently generates more than 89 GWh of energy each year and with over 48 MWh of storage provides active support to the national grid by reducing peak loads across the country by 16 MW every day.
SolarZero founder and chief executive Andrew Booth said BlackRock’s acquisition of the company would allow it to build on its track record and drive its next phase of growth, with plans to invest $1 billion in new solar and battery systems across New Zealand over the next 10 years.
“BlackRock Climate Infrastructure team’s investment and backing will enable us to rapidly scale, grow our energy services network, and accelerate the transition to a 100% clean energy future,” he said.
“By 2030, 50% of the world’s energy will be generated in the Asia Pacific region. The window to prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis is closing fast and the power couple of solar plus storage is one of the few true paths to energy security, stable power prices, prosperity, and a liveable planet.”

New Zealand has set a target of 100% renewable electricity generation by 2035 and to be a carbon-neutral economy by 2050 but with rooftop solar penetration currently at 2% and the expected demand for electricity in the nation to double by 2050, there is a clear need for additional residential solar.
BlackRock’s co-head of climate infrastructure for the Asia Pacific region, Charlie Reid, said the acquisition of SolarZero is the United States-headquartered company’s first investment in New Zealand and its first residential solar investment in the Asia Pacific.
“Our move into New Zealand demonstrates BlackRock’s commitment to invest in attractive markets as part of our broader efforts to offer a flow of addressable global climate investment opportunities for our clients,” he said.
“SolarZero is a global pioneer, and we look forward to supporting its expansion into other Asia-Pacific markets and, at the same time, to accelerating New Zealand’s net zero journey.”
The acquisition is subject to various conditions including approval by the New Zealand Overseas Investment Office.
The investment in SolarZero follows BlackRock’s recent acquisition of Melbourne-based battery storage developer Akaysha Energy and its portfolio of nine projects in the national grid.
BlackRock renewables portfolio in the Asia-Pacific region also includes recent investments in Taiwanese solar energy firm, New Green Power, Korean renewables energy developers, KREDO and Brite Energy Partners, and Australian electric vehicle (EV) charging provider JOLT.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/14/neoen-australia-plans-4-gwh-big-battery-for-wa/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2022",Neoen Australia plans 4 GWh big battery for WA,"Renewable power producer Neoen Australia has filed planning documents to develop a stand-alone 1 GW /4 GWh battery energy storage system (BESS) near the coal town of Collie in Western Australia’s (WA) southwest, providing vital system security for the South West Interconnected System (SWIS), the state’s main grid.
In planning documents lodged with the Shire of Collie, Neoen said the big battery will be built on a 31-hectare site about 12 kilometres northeast of Collie, approximately 215km southeast of Perth. The company said the battery is expected to be constructed in five 200 MW/800 MWh stages “or as required to meet the evolving needs of the SWIS”.
The company is also seeking approval to build new switchgear, a 330/33 kV substation with step-up power transformers and 330 kV overhead cables to connect to the existing Western Power transmission infrastructure.
Neoen said the staged approach to development means construction activities could span over 10 years, with each stage to generate up to 150 direct jobs over an approximately 12 to 24-month construction period.
The day-to-day operations and interactions with the wholesale electricity market (WEM) will be predominantly monitored and controlled remotely from the company’s Operation Control Centre (OCC) in Canberra which currently operates 14 existing projects across Australia.

Neoen says the Collie Battery is the key to unlocking future investment in, and uptake of, renewable energy in the state and helping to solve existing grid limitations by providing greater reserve capacity to the SWIS.
“System security risks are emerging now as the increase in large-scale renewable generation and distributed energy resources displaces the dispatchable thermal generators that presently provide all system security services such as inertia, frequency control, system strength, and voltage control,” Neoen said.
“The proposed project will address these issues. There is significant potential for the project to address intermittencies in energy supply due to the ability of utility-scale battery facilities to respond quickly to fluctuations in the grid.”
Neoen said once completed the 200 MW/400 MWh first stage of the Collie Battery will have the theoretical capacity to service the average energy needs of 260,000 households for an hour and will also stand ready to pump power into the grid in the event of a shortfall from other electricity generators in the SWIS.
“The aim is to provide short-duration storage in the peak times to ease pressure on the grid,” the company said. “The battery will be able to provide grid stability and other grid services which will also encourage more integration of more renewable energy into the network.”
The proposed Collie Battery is one of a number of energy storage projects being pursued in WA as the state prepares to exit coal-fired power by the end of the decade with Premier Mark McGowan earlier this year announcing that state-owned power provider Synergy would close its two remaining coal plants by 2029, declaring coal was no longer viable due to the high penetration of solar PV.

Synergy is among those companies making the shift to battery energy storage technology, having already commenced construction of the 100 MW/200 MWh Kwinana Big Battery being built at the site of the decommissioned Kwinana Power Station near Perth.
Sunshot Energy is also exploring large-scale energy storage, floating the potential for a 600-800 MWh battery to be built as part of a proposed green hydrogen industrial hub near Collie.
Neoen is also looking beyond the Collie Battery, recently submitting a development application for another battery facility in the Shire of Chittering to the northeast of Perth. The proposed Muchea Battery will be a stand-alone battery with a capacity of up to 200 MW/400 MWh.
The two WA battery projects are the just the latest for Neoen which marked its entry into the Australian market in 2017 with the now 150 MW/194 MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia, the world’s first big battery.
Since then it has rolled out a series of energy storage systems, including the 300 MW/450 MWh Victorian Big Battery which came online in December 2021. It is also developing several other big batteries in Australia, including the 100 MW/200 MWh Capital battery outside Canberra, a 300 MW/800 MWh battery in Blyth, north of Adelaide, and a 500 MW/1000 MWh battery to be built near Wallerawang west of Sydney.
Neoen said this week it has more than 2.5 GW of renewable assets in operation or under construction in Australia, representing more than $3.5 billion in investment. The company intends to reach 5 GW in Australia by 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/14/underground-caverns-to-help-unlock-australias-hydrogen-industry/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2022",Underground caverns to help unlock Australia’s hydrogen industry,"Australia has added another key ingredient to its plan to become a global green hydrogen superpower, with scientists from the federal government-backed Geoscience Australia uncovering underground salt accumulations suitable for high-volume hydrogen storage for both domestic use and export.
Hydrogen has been touted as a critical component of Australia’s renewable future but much of the conversation has focused on the production and applications of the fuel. Geoscience Australia said widespread adoption of hydrogen as an energy carrier will also require large-scale storage options to buffer the fluctuations in supply and demand.
While hydrogen is most commonly stored in tanks, either in a gas or liquid state, Geoscience Australia said underground salt caverns offer a safe and cheap large-scale alternative, and the technology, which involves producing artificial caverns in naturally occurring geological salt deposits, is already gaining a foothold internationally.
Data gathered by Geoscience Australian as part of the federal government’s $225 million Exploring for the Future program shows Australia also has the potential for high-volume underground storage of hydrogen in salt caverns.
Resources Minister Madeleine King said Geoscience Australia had uncovered potential for the development of multiple underground caverns in salt deposits across the Canning Basin in Western Australia, the Adavale Basin in Queensland and the offshore Polda Basin in South Australia.
“We know that the technology exists to store hydrogen underground and thanks to this work we now also know that Australia has the right geology to support the development of an economically viable hydrogen industry on our own soil,” she said.

King said the discovery “demonstrates Australia’s monumental potential as a hydrogen superpower”.
“Large-scale cost-effective storage of hydrogen will be essential in achieving our long-term goals for the future,” she said. “A single large salt cavern could provide the same amount of energy storage as Snowy Hydro 2.0 with multiple caverns this size possible in the same area.”
Industry focussed research, development and demonstration partnership Future Fuels Cooperative Research Centre (FFCRC) has also mapped Australia’s underground hydrogen storage capacity, indicating it could potentially house 310 million tonnes (38,000 PJ), a figure approximately 60 times larger than what a developed domestic and export Australian hydrogen industry would need, which FFCRC estimates at about five million tonnes (600 PJ).

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/14/energy-intensive-cryptocurrency-mining-slows-the-march-to-100-renewables/,"MICROGRID,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2022",Energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining slows the march to 100% renewables,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many other cryptocurrencies have come under spotlight for their disruption of financial markets. But one unintended consequence has been the disruption of the global energy market.
Bitcoin was estimated to burn about 76 billion kWh last year, about triple that of Ethereum. There are thousands of types of coins, and new ones springing up by the day.
The process of generating a unique coin is called mining, which may be an apt name for the practice, as it is a highly physical activity, and not the ethereal, cloud-like process that it may appear to be on surface. High-powered servers, or mining rigs, are required to show “proof of work,” performing increasingly complex math equations in the process of minting a unique coin. This requires a lot of energy, and in turn, expels a lot of carbon.
Fortune magazine said Bitcoin deploys an incredible 707 kWh and emits half a ton of carbon per transaction. This is hundreds of thousands of times the energy required by a credit card transaction. While cryptocurrency is hailed for increasing financial security through decentralisation, is the juice worth the squeeze?
Image: Wikimedia Commons
In response to this criticism, organisations like the Crypto Climate Accord and the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC) have been formed to, “promote transparency, share best practices, and educate the public on the benefits of bitcoin and bitcoin mining.”
BMC said, “bitcoin mining uses a negligible amount of energy, is rapidly becoming more efficient, and is powered by a higher mix of sustainable energy than any major country or industry.” It is estimated that about 50% of bitcoin mining is renewably powered, but lack of quality data and transparency challenge this figure.
Cambridge University’s Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index shows that in less than ten years, Bitcoin’s energy demand has increased from near-nothing about 200 TWh a year, more than the Netherlands and Austria, and nearly as much as Spain, which uses about 250 TWh each year. Its consumption is multiples higher than the Three Gorges Dam, the world’s largest power plant in terms of capacity.
Renewable energy represents roughly 28% of the world’s energy mix, indicating that there is much work to do to achieve carbon neutrality. By sharply increasing the demand for electricity, crypto mining can crowd out renewable energy development that could power other important functioning aspects of the economy like agriculture and transportation.
The carbon impact of cryptocurrency may impact its valuation going forward, said the European Central Bank. Last year, China placed a ban on all crypto transactions amid financial stability, consumer protection, financial crime, and environmental concerns. The European Parliament plans to submit a legislative report by 2025 on the climate impact of cryptocurrency, and New York State passed a bill that placed a two-year ban on certain carbon-based crypto mining operations.
Investment in cryptocurrencies may pose risks to corporations that have set environmental, social, and governance goals. Worldwide, a large group of banks representing 40% of global banking assets have voluntarily committed to achieving net zero emissions in their lending and investment portfolios by 2050. Transparency is difficult to achieve with cryptocurrency mining, meaning these banks and corporations may be unwilling to take on the risk of investment if it means compromising carbon emissions goals.
Distributed, decentralized power may be the best match to mitigate the environmental damage of cryptocurrency if it is to continue on this path. Solar and energy storage built in a distributed fashion can lessen the need for transmission infrastructure, reducing the overall raw material input supporting currency mining. It would also ensure a given mining operation is 100% renewably powered, rather than the roughly estimated 50% that powers it today.
Image: Mecobit
One company working in this space is MECO Limited, which recently released a solar panel kit along with a portable power station, to be coupled with its mining equipment. The new products are called the Mecobit Solar Unit M4000 and Solar Panel Kit.
Included in the portable Solar Unit M4000 is a lithium-ion battery bank and eight solar panels with a combined rated power of 3 kW. The Solar Panel Kit is a 2 kW model that integrates panels on top of a rack, with battery storage and the crypto miners mounted below.
The two kits are compatible with most home and Industrial appliances, equipment, tools, electronic devices such as cryptocurrency miners, providing backup and durable power for home and office use. While cryptocurrency mining could represent one destiny for the power generated by the system, it could also be used for essentials like refrigeration, heating and cooling, medical devices, lighting, and more.
