Specifically, the group of companies, which includes Atlassian, Unilever, Mirvac and Australian Ethical, want to see 1% of Australia’s GDP set aside for clean energy.
They also want to see Australian governments target a 700% renewable energy capacity, which would make Australia a leading global exporter of clean energy. The campaign is also calling for renewable energy industrial precincts, which would be located either within Renewable Energy Zones (REZ) or close by them.
Finally, and importantly, the group has tied climate action to social equity, highlighting the need for a fairer renewable energy transition to ensure First Nations, low-income households, workers and regional communities all benefit.

“Australia has all of the resources to become a leading exporter of renewables by 2030. With more support from our governments, we could produce enough clean, affordable energy to power our nation, plus have plenty left over to sell to our neighbours,” WWF Australia’s Energy Transition Manager, Nicky Ison, said. “For Australian businesses, this would mean creating hundreds of thousands and jobs and providing a significant boost to our economy. But we must act fast. If we don’t, we risk squandering a once-in-a-generation opportunity.”
In total, 102 businesses with tens of thousands of employees in a range of sectors have opted to back the Renewables Nation Campaign, hopefully shifting the federal government’s budget priorities which will be revealed next week.
Atlassian’s billionaire CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes has become somewhat of renewable energy champion in Australia, using numerous platforms to put pressure on government.

“Climate change poses an existential threat — not just to our environment, but to our health, our communities, and our economic well-being. If we get renewable energy right, not only will we create a more resilient planet, we have the opportunity to create the jobs of the future,” Atlassian’s Head of Strategy & Sustainability, Jessica Hyman, said.
“We have seen encouraging movement from state and federal governments to help Australia seize the opportunity of becoming a renewable export superpower, but there is so much more to do. It is excellent to see so many Australian businesses recognise the opportunity and join us in calling for more action,” WWF’s Ison said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/05/outgoing-agl-boss-singled-out-by-greenpeace-for-companys-shockingly-late-embrace-of-coal/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 5, 2021",Outgoing AGL boss singled out by Greenpeace for company’s shockingly late embrace of coal,"AGL generates around 20% of the total capacity in Australia’s electricity market and supplies almost one-third of its households. The company is enormous.
So when its Chief Executive and Managing Director Brett Redman made the abrupt announcement that he would leave the company in April, just weeks after it had gone public with plans to split itself into two separate entities, one green and customer facing, the other brown and presumably less publicised, connections were inevitably drawn.
A report released today authored by Greenpeace’s Drew Rooke examines the company, specifically its pollution record (which is terrible), but in doing so shines light on AGL under Redman – which appears to have actively pitted itself against the global tide decarbonisation and opted to buy a series of coal generation plants extremely late in the game – as in, this decade late.
Greenpeace
Unlike many of the other Australian institutions clinging to coal, AGL apparently isn’t doing so out of deep rooted loyalty. “In fact, only a decade ago it was widely considered the ‘greenest’ of Australia’s biggest energy retailers,” Greenpeace says Coal Faced: Exposing AGL as Australia’s biggest climate polluter.
In 2009, renewable energy actually accounted for about 34% of AGL’s total generation capacity. Today, in 2021, renewables account for just 10%.
Back to 2009, the year Obama was elected and two years into Kevin Rudd’s prime ministership, which was won on the back of a strong campaign for climate action. AGL was growing its renewables portfolio at an impressive yearly rate. Although the majority of its energy generation came from gas (48%), coal accounted for just 18% of its generation in 2009.

The company’s 2009 Annual Report also stated that in the future (an exact year was not given), it wanted to increase the share of renewable energy generation to 46% of its total capacity and decrease coal’s share to 11%.
That trajectory, however, was never realised. And Greenpeace lays the blame squarely at the feet of former CEO and Managing Director, Brett Redman.
Redman joined AGL in 2007 “after working for many years in large blue chip industrial companies.” By 2012, he was the company’s Chief Financial Officer.
It was in that role, Greenpeace says, he began to steer the company away from its clean energy plans and towards coal.
“Most significantly, he was primarily responsible for AGL’s acquisition of the Loy Yang A Power Station in 2012 and then of the Bayswater Power Station and the Liddell Power Station two years later.”
These three ageing plants represent over a quarter of Australia’s coal power station capacity and account for more than double the carbon emissions of Australia’s second biggest electricity generator (Origin). That’s more than BHP, Rio, Glencore and Qantas combined.
In 2020, the total electricity generation of these three coal-burning power stations was over 38,000 GWh – approximately 85% of AGL’s total electricity output for the year. Meanwhile. AGL’s renewables portfolio has held a stagnant 10% capacity for the last five years.
During this definitive but shockingly late turn towards coal at the expense of renewables, Redman was appointed was CEO and Managing Director of the company on a cushy $1,650,000 per annum. His held his role at the company’s helm from January 2019 to April 22, 2021.

While it would be foolish to pin the turn in tide for stronger climate action to a single event, the ousting of Donald Trump and election of now U.S. president Joe Biden certainly helped shift the tone.
In the last six months, a wave of world’s biggest emitters, including the U.S. and China (but not Australia), have made commitments to be net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. Such monumental shifts have put pressure on the three major companies which dominate Australia’s biggest emitting sector: AGL, EnergyAustralia, and Origin Energy.
All three companies have spent the year loudly announcing renewable projects and plans. AGL, especially, has desperately been trying to shake its label as Australia’s largest climate change contributor.

As part of its damage control, AGL announced in March that it would split in two. Its strange demerger would see it form “New AGL” which would manage electricity, gas and telecommunications retailing and “PrimeCo” which would operate the coal-burning power stations as well as some wind assets. Basically, the move would pave the way for New AGL to brand itself a green retailer without the assets of PrimeCo dirtying its record.
The market was incredulous. AGL remained in damage control, with Redman’s departure announcement four weeks later.
Greenpeace said the aim of its report on AGL was to help its “120,000 shareholders, millions of customers, and the broader Australian public better understand the truth about the company, how it became Australia’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases.”
It is trying to put pressure on the company to shift its trajectory at least back to the direction it was heading in 2009.
“As a giant in the Australian energy sector, AGL can ensure this transition happens as quickly as possible But at the moment it appears to be using its position and power to do the opposite,” the report says.
Redman’s replacement, Graeme Hunt, has doubled down on his predecessor’s plan to split the company into green and brown entities. In other words, there’s no evidence to suggest AGL will change its direction, even without Redman as its chief.
“It is not too late for AGL to take a different approach. Instead of clinging to coal until the bitter end, AGL can listen to the world’s scientific community about what is urgently required to avoid catastrophic climate change, follow the lead of some of its competitors in the Australian energy sector by closing all its coal-burning power stations before 2030, replacing them with renewable generation and prove through these actions that it is, as it claims, ‘helping to shape a sustainable energy future for Australia,’” Greenpeace’s author Rooke concluded.

A spokesperson from AGL said the company has a target of net zero emissions by 2050 and commitments to exit coal-fired power that endure from AGL’s 2015 greenhouse gas policy.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/05/government-millions-flow-to-green-hydrogen-projects-despite-concern-around-gas-couplings/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 5, 2021","$103 million flows from ARENA to commercial ‘green’ hydrogen projects, despite concern around gas couplings","The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) today announced the three projects it’s conditionally approved to back under its Renewable Hydrogen Deployment Funding Round, which was increased from an initial $70 million to over $100 million.
Engie Renewables Australia has been awarded $42.5 million from the government agency to go towards a 10 MW electrolyser project it has with Yara Pilbara Fertilisers in Karratha, Western Australia, where it is seeking to use renewable hydrogen to produce ammonia for export.
ATCO Australia has also been conditionally approved for $28.7 million in government funding for a 10 MW electrolyser project, although its intention is to use it for gas blending its Innovation Park in Warradarge, midwest Western Australia.
Australian Gas Networks Limited (AGIG) is the final successful funding candidate, drawing $32.1 million for another 10 MW electrolyser for gas blending at AGIG’s Murray Valley Hydrogen Park in Wodonga, Victoria.
With all three projects planning to use 10 MW electrolysers, the subsequent hydrogen facilities will be among the largest built in the world so far. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency says the projects will help get Australia to the government’s goal of ‘H2 under $2’ (that is, hydrogen priced at $2 per kilogram, a rate at which it would be globally competitive with other fuel sources).

There is a growing choir of voices raising concerns, however, about gas projects attracting government money allocated for renewables by including 2021’s buzzword, hydrogen. Both ATCO and Australian Gas Networks’ projects fall into this category. The questions they raise ultimately centre on whether ‘stepping stones’ enable or disable cleaner energy systems.
Just yesterday it was announcement EnergyAustralia had attracted over $80 million in government funds to build Australia’s first ‘green hydrogen’ and gas peaker power plant near Wollongong on the New South Wales south coast. The news was immediately met with indignation from industry peak body the Clean Energy Council.
“If private investors are willing to bet on gas over energy storage, that’s a decision for them. But the general public is becoming increasingly uncomfortable seeing their taxes used to prop up more expensive fossil fuel generators,” the Council’s Chief Executive Kane Thornton said in a media statement about the news.
Thornton went on to say taxpayer dollars would be better spent on large-scale battery storage, pumped hydro and accelerating transmission upgrades to provide cost-effective, reliable, flexible and low-emissions power.
Dr Kerry Schott, the Independent Chair of Australia’s Energy Security Board – the body tasked with designing Australia’s electricity system transition – seems to be far less convinced that big batteries are Australia’s panacea.
“[Batteries have a] duration at the moment that’s largely limited to about four hours and that will not be sufficient to get us through… so we do need backup,” she said at a briefing yesterday.
Aware of the cool reception it would elicit, Schott said gas, blended gas and hydrogen and perhaps “in due course” hydrogen alone would be necessary for the time being to ensure reliability of Australia’s electricity systems.

Australian governments, both federal and state, have set aside considerable sums to fund hydrogen projects – which have been the subject of enormous excitement globally this year.
ARENA launched its funding round in 2020, designed to support Australia’s first commercial scale hydrogen projects to fast track the country’s renewable hydrogen industry.
The funding round called for expressions of interest from large scale hydrogen electrolyser projects across Australia focussed on the commercialisation of key component technologies and facilitating cost reductions for producing renewable hydrogen. ARENA said it received 36 expressions of interest, and following an initial assessment, seven projects were shortlisted and invited to submit full applications.
After an extensive assessment process, Engie, ATCO and AGIG were conditionally approved for funding and must now satisfy a number of development provisions and achieve financial close before funding is released.
“Our hydrogen industry in Australia is in its infancy, so the lessons learned from these three projects – and the entire funding round – will be important in driving our future hydrogen economy,” ARENA’s CEO, Darren Miller, said in a statement.
“With more than $100 million in funding, we’re hoping to build some of the biggest hydrogen electrolysers in the world, with the ultimate goal of bringing down the cost of hydrogen produced using renewable energy and growing our skills and capacity to meet future global demand for hydrogen.”
Miller went on to describe Australia as “well placed” to become a major player in the global hydrogen market – a view which has almost uniform support in Australia.
ARENA said it has committed over $57 million to hydrogen projects since 2016, including $22.1 million towards 16 research and development projects.

The hub would include large-scale solar, wind, and battery energy storage assets in South Australia, inlcuding three solar projects at Robertstown (636 MW), Bungama (336 MW) and Yoorndoo Ilga (388 MW), supported by a total energy storage capacity of 540 MW. 
Two of the projects form part of a plan to generate hydrogen for both he domestic and export markets from the Spencer facility to ports in Asia where Amp is already in operation. South Australia set out its plans for green hydrogen hubs in November last year, hubs centred on Port Bonython, Cape Hardy/Port Spencer and Port Adelaide; and a blue-hydrogen hub, using natural gas extracted from the Cooper Basin, processed in the vicinity of Moomba, and exported through Port Bonython.
The Port Bonython green hub assumes 2.3-6.5 GW renewable energy development to feed electrolysers of 1.2-2.5 GW; and Cape/Hardy Port Spencer green hub assumes 1.1-6.1 GW of generation to feed 0.6-2.6 GW of electrolyser capacity — at 75% of electrolyser utilisation to allow for intermittent supply.
The Canadian outfit is wasting no time with this massive investment, having already secured development and land approvals for both the Robertstown and Bungama projects, and setting an energisation date in late 2022. Amp says these two projects alone will create 550 full-time jobs during the construction phase. 
Robertstown, the location for the 636 MW project, is ideally placed for the planned NSW-SA Interconnector. The 900km, 330kV PEC is set to connect the SA and NSW power grids for the first time, linking Robertstown to Wagga Wagga in New South Wales (NSW) and Red Cliffs in Victoria. 
”The strategic value of the South Australian portfolio is significant in a jurisdiction which is undergoing one of the most rapid energy transitions in the world”. said Dean Cooper, executive vice president and head of Amp Australia.
The SA Minister for Trade and Investment, Stephen Patterson, welcomed the prospect of the REHSA, saying “South Australia has significant land mass and world-class wind and solar resources, with aspirations of reaching net 100% renewable energy generation by 2030.”
“We’ve seen over $7 billion invested in projects with another $20 billion in the pipeline,” Patterson continued, “The Renewable Energy Hub of South Australia will be fundamental in integrating our state’s renewable energy storage assets and building our capability and supporting the fast-moving energy transitions we’re experiencing.”
This new strategic expansion continues from Amp’s existing presence in Australia which currently sits at 158 MW of operating or under construction solar assets in NSW, such as the 39 MW Molong Solar Farm, near Orange.

With energy storage technology playing an ever more important role in our daily lives, one that is set to increase dramatically with the adoption of electric vehicles, availability of the materials to manufacture lithium-ion batteries, their safe disposal and strategies for recycling are increasingly important concerns.
Though Europe and other regions are beginning to introduce laws requiring use of recycled materials in battery production, extracting these economically remains a major challenge for recyclers – separating and purifying the materials to the point where they can be reused requires multiple expensive and energy-intensive processes.
Scientists led by Finland’s Aalto University were initially studying the ageing mechanisms of lithium cobalt oxide, commonly used in consumer electronics products, and made an observation that led them to investigate new methods to extend their lifetime or enable reuse of components without the complex process of stripping them down to raw materials. “We noticed that one of the main causes of battery deterioration is the depletion of lithium in the electrode material,” explained Aalto University professor Tanja Kallio. “The structures can nevertheless remain relatively stable, so we wanted to see if they can be reused.”
The group developed an electrolysis process to replenish the lithium in battery electrodes, and then compared the performance of electrodes treated in this way with those made from brand new materials. The results are published in the journal ChemSusChem, in a paper titled The reuse of LiCoO2 electrodes collected from spent Li‐ion batteries after the electrochemical re‐lithiation of the electrode.
The group found that the re-lithiation process served to restore the original electrode structure, and demonstrated capacity, rate capability, and cyclability properties only slightly behind the brand new batteries. The group further noted that comparable electrolysis processes are already used in various industries, and that their approach would also be worth investigating on an industrial scale.
“By reusing the structures of batteries we can avoid a lot of the labor that is common in recycling and potentially save energy at the same time,” says Kallio. “We believe that the method could help companies that are developing industrial recycling.”
For now, the group at Aalto University’s next goal will be to test and optimise its process for use with other battery chemistries, particularly the nickel-rich cathode designs that have moved to large-scale production in recent years, primarily as batteries for electric vehicles.

First Solar and Nel Hydrogen Electrolyser, a division of Nel ASA, a supplier of hydrogen technology, said they will develop integrated photovoltaic/hydrogen power plants.
First Solar and Nel will initially collaborate to develop an integrated power plant control and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. The development of this network architecture is critical to enable optimisation of PV-electrolyser hybrid projects, resulting in low total cost of hydrogen and electricity. After that, the two will explore  ways of optimising and integrating technology throughout the solar and hydrogen production plant.
In statements, both companies stressed their desire to deliver the lowest total cost of solar to hydrogen possible. Both also noted that First Solar’s low-carbon production of its cadmium-telluride modules was significant for keeping emissions low.
Because the partnership is so recent in nature, no project timelines have been released as of yet.
