The $73 million Northern Goldfields Solar Project will comprise a 27.4 MW solar farm at Mt Keith and a 10.7 MW solar farm and 10.1 MW/5.4 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) at Leinster which will displace power currently supplied by diesel and gas turbine generation.
TransAlta will build, own and operate the Northern Goldfields Solar Project which will be integrated into its 169 MW Southern Cross Energy North remote network, which currently comprises two simple-cycle power stations, each with one gas turbine.
Juwi Renewable Energy, the Brisbane-based subsidiary of German company juwi, has been awarded the engineering, procurement and construction agreement for the new hybrid solar + storage project.
BHP said the final notice to proceed is expected later this year with construction due to commence in early 2022. The solar farms and BESS are expected to come online in early 2023.
BHP Nickel West asset president Eddy Haegel said the project marks the first on-site solar farm and battery at any of the multinational’s global operations.
Haegel said the clean energy sources will cut emissions from electricity use at the refinery and help BHP meet its emissions reduction targets and to deliver lower carbon, sustainable nickel to its customers.
“The Northern Goldfields Solar Project will further improve our position as one of the lowest carbon nickel miners in the world,” he said.
“It will reduce emissions from electricity use at Mt Keith and Leinster by 12%, reduce fuel costs and improve the reliability of our electricity supply with the addition of the battery storage system.”
The project is expected to reduce BHP’s Scope 2 electricity greenhouse gas emissions from its Leinster and Mt Keith operations by 540,000 tonnes of CO2 over the first 10 years of operation.

TransAlta president Todd Stack said the project is the company’s first solar and battery storage hybrid project and signalled an expansion of its renewable generation footprint into Australia.
“This project further strengthens our existing relationship with BHP as we continue to evaluate further renewable energy opportunities and high efficiency repowering options for our customers’ operations,” he said.
“Our ability to integrate renewable energy solutions, reliably and affordably, into remote and off-grid networks uniquely positions us to enable our customers to achieve their sustainability goals.”
The project is the first renewable energy project to be developed under the PPA TransAlta recently extended with BHP and will have a term of 16.3 years.
BHP has also signed a PPA with Risen Energy which will see the 100 MW Merredin Solar Farm in WA supply up to 50% of the miner’s electricity needs at its Nickel West Kwinana refinery over the coming 10 years.
Nickel West’s bundled PPA (which combines tradeable Large-scale Generation Certificates with purchase of power) commenced on February 1 and will displace around 364,000 tonnes of CO2 over the duration of the contract, which also has an option for extension beyond its scheduled 2031 end date.
The Northern Goldfields Solar Project announcement comes just one week after BHP signed a nickel supply agreement with United States-based electric vehicles manufacturer Tesla.
That agreement will see BHP supply Tesla with nickel from its Nickel West plant, with the key metal to be used by the carmaker to manufacture electric vehicle (EV) batteries.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/30/arena-tips-25-million-funding-package-to-drive-ev-uptake/,"EV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 30, 2021",ARENA tips $25 million funding package to drive EV uptake,"Australian petroleum major Ampol is one of five companies set to share in a $24.55 million funding package after the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) announced on Friday it will partially fund the rollout of more than 400 privately operated electric vehicle (EV) fast-charging stations across the nation.
ARENA said the funding package, part of the Federal Government’s Future Fuels Fund, will catalyse a total investment value of $79.9 million and deliver a seven-fold increase in the number of fast-charging EV stations in Australia’s most populated cities and regions.
Charging stations will be built across eight geographic regions covering 14 of Australia’s most populous cities. In addition to networks in the capital cities in every state and territory, regional centres including Geelong, Newcastle, Wollongong and the Sunshine Coast will each receive a minimum of eight new fast-charging stations to drive the uptake of EVs in regional locations.
Australia has been slow to embrace EVs with data provided by industry body the Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) revealing key barriers include vehicle prices, model availability, and the distance over which they can travel on a single charge.
The lack of access to charging stations is another major roadblock with more than 50% of motorists citing it as a key barrier to the adoption of EVs.
EVC chief executive Behyad Jafari has previously said establishing a comprehensive network of fast-charging stations will be critical to the uptake of EVs in Australia.
ARENA chief executive Darren Miller said the latest funding package will significantly expand Australia’s fast-charging network and remove barriers to the uptake of EVs.
“As the costs of electric vehicles come down, more consumers and fleet users are looking to go electric. Expanding the fast-charging network will make it easier than ever to drive an EV in Australia,” he said.

Ampol is one of five applicants to receive funding. Other successful applicants are Evie Networks, Engie, Chargefox, and Electric Highways Tasmania.
Together, the five applicants will deliver 403 new fast-charging stations, each capable of charging at least two vehicles concurrently at 50 kW or above.
Ampol received $7.05 million from ARENA in the first round of funding and managing director Matt Halliday said it will allow the petrol retailer to deliver fast-charging bays at 121 sites across its network. The rollout, to be co-funded with $7m from the oil company itself, will begin in the second half of 2021.
“Today’s announcement highlights the key role our existing network, skills and infrastructure will play in delivering EV charging to Australian consumers,” Halliday said.
“Ampol’s national retail network, along Australia’s major highways and close to existing high-traffic roads, closely matches our country’s population and is strategically located to help minimise range anxiety for EV users.
“We remain confident in our ability to evolve our retail network to support battery electric vehicle adoption.”

Evie Networks, which earlier this month announced a partnership with Puma Energy to rollout ultra-fast EV charging stations at selected truck stop locations in Queensland, will deliver 158 public fast-charging stations across eight regions after securing $8.85 million in funding.
The Australian arm of French renewables giant Engie will install 103 charging stations across four regions after receiving $6.85 million while Sydney-based Chargefox will deliver 16 EV charging stations after being allocated $1.4 million.
Electric Highways Tasmania was awarded $400,000 to install five charging stations in the island state.
The Future Fuels Fund is a $71.9 million initiative announced in the 2020-21 Federal Budget to remove barriers to the uptake of new vehicle technologies.
The initial allocation for round one of funding was $16.5 million, but Miller said it was increased to $24.55 million “based on the high merit of applicants”.
“The proposals we received were of such high quality, we were compelled to increase the funding,” he said.
“We’re delighted to be able to support more than 400 charging stations across the country.”

SPS – self-sufficient power systems combining solar PV and battery technology, generally backed up by a diesel generator – have emerged as an increasingly cost-effective and efficient option for grid operators searching for more reliable alternatives to the traditional poles and wires in remote areas.
The partnership agreement between the three companies is expected to deliver a range of innovative solutions for customers in isolated areas, along with data centres and other energy intensive industries.
It will also see the parties work together over the next two years to identify the use of LAVO’s hydrogen storage solutions and other zero-carbon products in different demonstration sites.
LAVO chief executive Alan Yu said potential applications for the technology include standalone hybrid power supplies, containerised solutions for small and utility scale wind and solar projects and packaged power and battery solutions for data centres, industrial and mining applications.
“Lavo’s hydrogen storage technology is ideally suited for integration with remote standalone power systems and for other containerised and mobile power solutions,” Yu said.
“We’re thrilled to be working with Ampcontrol and Boundary Power to explore the options for wider use of our products.”

Developed in partnership with the University of New South Wales’ Hydrogen Energy Research Centre, LAVO’s hydrogen energy storage system uses patented metal hybrid technology to store hydrogen equivalent to up to 60 kWh which will produce 40 kWh of useable electricity.
At installation, the energy storage system is connected to a solar PV array via a hybrid inverter, and to water via a purification system, to enable internal electrolysers to convert excess energy into hydrogen, which it stores in four canisters.
When stored energy is needed, the LAVO activates a fuel cell to deliver electricity to the residence or business. An integrated 5 kWh lithium battery provides a buffer that can provide instantaneous response to power shortage or outage.
Ampcontrol CEO and Boundary Power director Rod Henderson said LAVO’s energy storage system appears ideally suited to off-grid applications and the partnership would allow it to further explore its potential.
“Ampcontrol has a long history in the development of innovative products and Boundary Power possesses industry leading experience in utility-grade stand-alone power solutions,” he said.
“Our partnership with LAVO is the continuation of our commitment to finding the best solutions to the energy challenges facing remote areas and energy intensive industries.”

Western Australia has become a hot spot for SPS technology with the state government earlier this year announcing a $17 million package to roll out another 98 units across regional WA in 2021 as part of a $218 million commitment to manufacture and install more than 1,000 SPS over the next four years.
Boundary Power, a joint venture between Ampcontrol and Western Australian state-owned energy utility Horizon Power, is among the companies tapped to develop and install the off-grid systems.
Perth-based manufacturer Hybrid Systems Australia, a subsidiary of QIC-owned Pacific Energy, is also involved in the SPS roll out and has also been exploring the potential of the LAVO system.
Hybrid Systems executive director Michael Hall told pv magazine the hydrogen technology has the potential to not only produce cost savings but also value add to the SPS units, suggesting it could initially be used in place of the diesel generator as a back-up energy source.
“We’ve done some early scoping studies on the LAVO looked at integrating it into our standalone power systems,” he said.
“We’ve also looked at the possibility of adding that value train to our SPS instead of, or as additional energy towards the battery.”

A new climate factbook released by BloombergNEF has criticised the policy actions of G20 members, and highlighted the significance of poorly directed fossil-fuel funding.
The Climate Policy Factbook published this month has monitored the progress made towards a low-carbon economy by G20 members, which include the EU alongside 19 of the world’s biggest national economies.
The headline figure is that governments provided a reported $3.3 trillion of direct support for coal, oil and gas plus related fossil-fuel power for the period between 2015 and 2019. Considering 2021 prices, Bloomberg puts that sum as being able to fund 4,232 GW of new solar power plants.
That figure is listed as being more than 3.5 times the size of the U.S. grid, and close to 80 times more than the sum of total grid-connected solar installed in Germany, one of the world’s leaders in PV. Still, the report lists Germany as investing $46 billion in fossil-fuel support in the 2015-2019 period – the same amount as the U.S.
China, with $793 billion spent on fossil fuels, Saudi Arabia ($440 billion), and Russia ($406 billion), were listed as the largest supporters:

Bloomberg’s factbook added, support for fossil fuels in 2019 by G20 countries was comprised of investments by state-owned enterprises. Singling out Turkey, a large-scale coal plant investor, the report noted analysis that said for the cost of adding 10 GW of coal power, Turkey could build 25 GW of solar.
The Climate Policy Fact Book focuses on three areas for government action to limit warming:
Michael Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg, and the UN secretary-general’s special envoy on climate ambition and solutions, said: “Winning the fight against climate change requires urgent and bold action across every industry and we need governments to lead the way. Our hope is that G20 members take this report to heart, use its recommendations to hit their Paris Agreement targets, and show the world the health and economic benefits of building a resilient, sustainable global economy.”
Antha Williams, environment lead at Bloomberg Philanthropies, said the continued backing for coal, oil and gas is “reckless,” with urgent action required. “As a host of climate emergencies intensify around the world, the continued development of fossil fuel infrastructure is nothing short of reckless,” she said.
The G20 agreed in 2009, to “phase out and rationalise, over the medium term, inefficient fossil fuel subsidies,” but did not define “inefficient.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/30/commercial-and-industrial-rooftops-in-india-could-deploy-1875-mw-of-solar-in-2021/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"JULY 30, 2021","Commercial and industrial rooftops in India could deploy 1,875 MW of solar in 2021","From pv magazine India
India could add 1,875 megawatts (MW) of new rooftop solar capacity across the commercial and industrial segment in 2021, a 47% increase over the previous year, according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and JMK Research.
As of 2020, India had deployed a rooftop solar capacity of 7,920 MW, with at least 75% of the installations done in the commercial and industrial segment.
New rooftop installation rate in the commercial and industrial segment was impacted in 2020 due to the Covid pandemic. However, deployment is expected to bounce back this year as a new generation of technologies makes rooftop solar even more cost-effective for corporates looking to cut their electricity costs. 
“Adoption of onsite [rooftop] solar solutions is the low-hanging fruit for consumers that want to optimise their electricity costs or increase their procurement of renewable power,” said Vibhuti Garg, Energy Economist and Lead India at IEEFA.
“The pandemic has increased the price sensitivity of C&I consumers who already pay higher tariffs to cross-subsidise agricultural and residential consumers. Saving on electricity costs is absolutely critical for them.”
Falling PV module and battery prices make the transition to PV installations even more appealing. 
“Solar module and battery prices have already fallen, and with the government’s new Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to boost domestic solar manufacturing, solar technology prices are expected to drop even further,” said Garg.
Other factors expected to boost the uptake of rooftop solar among C&I consumers are more accessible financing options and corporates wanting to switch to 100% renewable energy to meet their RE100 commitments.
The C&I segment is exploring bifacial and large-wafer, high-wattage (400+/500+Wp) modules to optimise costs and maximise output (kWh/m2), especially for sites with space constraints. 
The IEEFA-JMK report provides case studies of projects in India that have applied these emerging technologies.
“Some of these solutions such as higher-wattage modules and bifacial modules offer considerable value-addition in terms of energy generation,” said lead author Jyoti Gulia, founder of JMK Research.
The report notes that higher-wattage modules in onsite solar installations in India increase plant generation by 1% while reducing the cost of balance-of-system (PV system components except modules) by 1%. These benefits are particularly significant for space-constrained sites.
“As identified in the report’s case studies, bifacial modules increase total energy generation by 4-5% compared with a project equipped with monofacial modules, and so reduces the levelised cost of energy (LCOE),” said Gulia.
Battery storage, integration of solar PV with electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are the other trends picking up pace.
The report expects the integration of battery storage in rooftop projects also to pick up pace as battery prices fall dramatically to US$100/kWh by 2023.
There is also a huge opportunity for rooftop solar+battery energy storage systems (BESS) to replace diesel gensets, which represent 90 GW of aggregate capacity in behind-the-meter applications in India.
According to IEEFA’s distributed energy resources (DER) specialist Gabrielle Kuiper, other nascent onsite technological models likely to be explored by developers in India include rooftop solar integrated with electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and the adoption of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV).
 “Government policy initiatives are already boosting the adoption of EVs,” said Kuiper. “Combining rooftop solar with storage and EVs is a cost-effective solution.
“And BIPV presents an attractive long-term opportunity for corporates that are planning to set up new commercial buildings and offices in India.”
