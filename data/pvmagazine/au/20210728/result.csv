Professor Nann is today the Head of the School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the University of Newcastle but became a chemist in his homeland, Germany.
In April, he launched startup Allegro Energy with two of his former students, Fraser Hughson and Rohan Borah. The startup seeks to commercialise its microemulsion battery electrolyte which, although mostly water by mass, has overcome the voltage limitations that typically hinder water-based solutions.
Electrolyte sits between batteries’ anodes and cathodes, allowing ions to pass between the two conductors. In batteries, electrolytes are usually either water-based or use an organic solvent. Both these forms present their own issues. Organic solvent-based solutions, for instance, tend to have good electrochemical stability but are expensive and potentially toxic. With water-based or aqueous electrolytes, the issue is the solution only remains stable up to 1.23 volts, at which point the water splits into its separate hydrogen and oxygen molecules.
So when Professor Nann began training his attention on battery storage, he came up against precisely these issues which have puzzled researchers for decades. “At some point, I just thought ‘why not do both?’” Professor Nann told pv magazine Australia. That is, why not make an electrolyte with both water and solvent components in the form of a microemulsion. “We were completely blown away at how well it worked.”
Allegro Energy
Of course, microemulsions aren’t quite as simple as adding dishwashing liquid and oil to water – rather, it’s the combination of water molecules with hydrophobic liquid, coupled with a surfactant which allows the two normally repellent solvents to bond. Basically the combination happens on such a ‘micro’ level it is not able to be split. “It’s thermodynamically stable,” Professor Nann said. “That makes them special and that’s why we can use them in a battery.”
When I asked why the concept had never been applied to battery storage, Professor Nann laughed – “that’s a really good question!”
“Actually when we submitted the patent in the first place, the patent officers came back to us and said ‘well, that’s too trivial’ and we made exactly that argument – why did no one else do that then?” he said. “I think just no one has thought of that.”
The nub of Professor Nann and his co-founders’ discovery is that if you use a microemulsion as a battery electrolyte, you can overcome water’s pesky 1.2 volt barrier. “That’s kind of the secret sauce,” Professor Nann said.
“It’s very unusual – normally when you do research, you fail 99% of the time but that worked straight away,” he addd. “It opened up a whole new world of research.”
The beauty of the solution is its simplicity – which makes it extremely cheap, as well as fair easier and less carbon intensive to manufacture.
According to the startup’s modelling, 70% of the price of supercapacitors, which is the first form of energy storage Allegro plans to focus on, comes down to the cost of its electrolyte. “One litre or kilogram of the current electrolyte costs about US$10, ours costs 10 cents,” Professor Nann said.
“So it’s a factor of 100 cheaper.”
The electrolytes currently being used in supercapacitors are also air sensitive, so they require a protective atmosphere in manufacturing. “That’s not necessary with ours… and that’s a huge advantage in manufacturing because it’s way cheaper.”
“We also did some estimates in the carbon footprint of manufacturing our supercaps, and we save about 70% of carbon dioxide just by not having that protective atmosphere,” Professor Nann added.
Allegro Energy’s electrolyte also helps batteries overcome their stubborn paradox of being both a renewable energy enabler and simultaneously extremely toxic and difficult to recycle. Typically the electrolyte is one of batteries’ most hazardous and corrosive elements, but Allegro’s microemulsion electrolyte combination contains nothing “problematic,” making it compatible with long term visions of circular economies.
After Professor Nann discovered the solution, he and his team went about screening different battery types and assessing where it worked best. There were two standouts: supercapacitors and redox flow batteries.
Supercapacitors work similarly to a battery but involve no chemical reaction. Rather the energy is stored and harvested simply by separating charges physically. Which means they work faster, but tend to not store as much energy.
Tesla has begun coupling supercapacitors (which are tiny) with lithium-ion batteries in its cars, using supercapacitors to generate the burst of energy for acceleration, before coasting on lithium-ion. 
Eyeing this potential in transport, Professor Nann told pv magazine Australia Allegro Energy will initially focus on the mining industry, which is one of Australia’s biggest emitters. Coming under increasing scrutiny, many of the main companies have started committing to carbon reduction targets, which Professor Nann says will mean nothing short of electrifying all their processes. This, of course, offers huge potential.
Supercapacitors are able to charge and discharge extremely quickly – which has seen them used, for instance, in Newcastle’s tram which charges during the 20 seconds stops it makes on its route. Like trams, trucks and other mining transport follow predicable paths, making the rapidly transforming industry a perfect candidate for Allegro.
Grid-scale redox flow batteries are another arena Allegro plans to explore, both in terms of coupling with supercapacitors and for integrating with its electrolyte.

“When you store energy at the grid level, you want something cheap and big and redox flow is perfect for that. But the power you get out of that and the response times are really bad… it takes about a minute or so before the system can respond to demand,” Professor Nann explained.
These slow response times inhibit the battery from responding to rapid power surges and troughs, which is a problem for both grid stability and also trading on the Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) market, which has proven extremely lucrative for Australia’s big batteries.
“If you now marry [redox flow batteries] with a supercapacitor, it has fantastically fast response times where you can pretty much respond in real time to any demand,” Professor Nann said.
As cheap, easy to produce and non-toxic as Allegro’s electrolyte solution is, the startup is already butting up against a barrier: the complete dearth of battery manufacturing capacity in Australia.
As far as Professor Nann sees it, there’s two solutions. The first and least desirable is to move production overseas. “That’s a last resort,” he said.

“The other strategy we are looking at is to start small and grow organically.” At the moment, the startup is working on ‘lab scale’, “so we are making our supercaps by hand.” Professor Nann’s hope is that the company can ramp up to small-scale production, and continue growing as revenue increases.
Allegro is currently also looking for commercial partners and collaborators, which could potentially also ease some of this production impasse.
Allegro Energy is one of the eight finalists in this year’s Climate Launchpad initiative, run by Climate-KIC Australia, a sister organisation of Europe’s Climate-KIC funded by the European Union.
The program, which Professor Nann quips has helped turn the team of academics to business people, is offering a $50,000 prize to its winner. Money, Professor Nann says, which would help the startup step out of the lab and into manufacturing.

“The specialised training facility will provide pre-trade, apprenticeship and post trade courses for up to 300 students at a time and support 40 teaching positions,” Miles said in a statement about the announcement this afternoon.
“While we’re investing in renewable energy projects throughout the state, it is also important we invest in our workforce to deliver and maintain renewable energy infrastructure.”
The minister granted the facility approval through the Ministerial Infrastructure Designation process, an alternative pathway for the delivery of community infrastructure, including education facilities.
Miles said his decision will enable Electro Group, the training organisation behind the facility, to start construction and welcome students as soon as possible. Donna Pickford, Electro Group’s CEO, said construction is set to begin in September of this year, with students to arrive from mid-2022.
The Queensland state government is investing $17 million towards the $23 million facility, which it says will help it reach its 50% renewable target by 2030.
“Meeting our renewable energy target relies on having a pipeline of skilled Queenslanders ready to build and operate the energy infrastructure a growing industrial state needs,” Queensland’s Minister for Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen, Mick de Brenni said.
“That’s exactly what the Pinkenba Renewable Energy Training Facility will deliver, with electrical, solar and telecommunications training to be offered to hundreds of Queenslanders each year,” he added.
Electro Group’s Pickford said the training facility will provide both current and prospective electrical workers with “classroom learning and out in the field training”.
This will see students able to access a 17m high wind turbine, a 20m high climbing tower, a 30m telecommunications tower and a 54 kw single axis tracking solar system, she said.
“Being able to provide both current and future electrical workers with this hands-on experience will mean they’ll be fully equipped to take on the jobs of tomorrow,” she added.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/28/why-insurers-are-adjusting-underwriting-criteria-for-renewable-assets/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JULY 28, 2021",Why insurers are adjusting underwriting criteria for renewable assets,"By their nature, renewable energy projects look to take advantage of certain climactic conditions and correspondingly are increasingly being built in locations at risk of extreme weather events. Consequently, for owners of renewable energy assets, this results in more scrutiny over appropriate insurance policy terms and conditions, as insurers seek to mitigate the potential impact of natural catastrophe events and resultant claims activity. Accordingly, insurers are focusing more than ever on understanding these perils, analysing the likelihood of such events happening as well as the potential losses that may result.
We partnered with Berkshire Hathaway Speciality Insurance (BHSI) to understand insurers’ methodologies for underwriting natural catastrophe peril exposures and analyse the criteria that influences capital deployment and policy terms and conditions.
BMS
Modelling natural catastrophe perils
Every project site will have unique exposures to a variety of hazards, including the major perils of flooding and windstorm, and the so-called “secondary perils” of lightning, hail and bushfire. As such, underwriters require site-specific data to build a detailed understanding of a given project or location’s risk profile, including accurate and comprehensive location data to eliminate the possibility that natural catastrophe exposures which cross asset boundaries are not inadvertently missed due to the project spanning over several hundreds of hectares.
Natural catastrophe perils are typically low-frequency, high-impact events which can cause significant insured losses. Therefore, insurance companies invest considerable resources into understanding exposure to these perils so as to ensure adequate capitalisation for expected losses. Consequently, they make use of several different catastrophe models to quantify and understand the risk. Many of these models are based on historical data, which provides valuable insights into past events; however, there is a need to look beyond historical records which are typically too short to fully indicate localised hazards. This is especially true in Australia, where the low frequency of natural catastrophes mean historical data is sometimes insufficient in predicting potential future losses.
An often-cited example is the hail damage to a large proportion of photovoltaic (PV) modules at the 178-megawatt Midway Solar Project in Texas in May 2019. From a natural hazard perspective, the magnitude and intensity of the hail was well within expectations but since the area is largely unpopulated there was a lack of historical data regarding building or other asset damage. The insured losses reached US$70 million with losses arising from damaged PV modules and undamaged PV modules that had suffered “micro-cracking”. As a result of the hailstorm, insurers specialising in the renewable energy sector have sought to adjust their underwriting criteria to mitigate the impact of these unexpected events by virtue of specific coverage restrictions. 
BMS
In the case of the Texas solar project, historical-based modelling was not sufficient to predict the impact of such an event. In contrast, using probabilistic models enables insurers to better account for the impact of future events. A probabilistic methodology looks beyond historical data, considering all realistic possibilities that could occur within a set timeframe. It’s a robust approach that quantifies the likelihood of an event happening in a certain year, as well as the ramifications of such an event.
Impacts on terms & conditions
As the market develops and insurers embrace higher standards of data, analytics and insights into a location’s true exposure, it may drive increased insurer confidence in the risk exposure resulting in more competitive pricing of insurance and allow for broader coverage for insureds. Insurers will be able to differentiate their appetite to underwrite projects through the terms and conditions they offer and the premium levels they charge.
As natural catastrophe events are expected to occur ever more frequently as a result of climate change, this will continue to impact insurers’ underwriting decisions and criteria will tighten. This in turn will mean that owners of, and investors and financiers in, renewable projects will need to provide more granular, detailed data regarding a site location’s risk profile. As an example, when it comes to flooding events, the fact that a site has a known propensity to flooding does not make it uninsurable. Rather it requires evidence of adequate risk mitigation initiatives such as having a flood management plan in place, storing equipment on high ground and building equipment above designated flood levels. 
BMS Australia
For all perils, the level of coverage offered will reflect the site-specific risk and the mitigation methods being implemented by the owner or developer. The more an underwriter understands regarding both the physical risks present and the procedures in place to manage these, the better the outcome or solution will be for all parties. One of the most significant challenges for those seeking insurance is a request for more detailed project information relating to exposure that has not been accounted for or is not readily available. Having this information already at hand quickens the process and limits the likelihood of there being an adverse impact on policy terms and conditions which could in turn negatively impact a project’s financials.
An effective and timely approach to risk assessment and insurer engagement process is one of the best ways a project owner or developer can make sure that they have the appropriate insurance, for the best possible price. There will always be risk, the goal is not to eliminate risk but rather to ensure that insureds are prepared for the risks that are applicable to them. Not only does this save on potential premium costs, but it also supports the underwriting methodology of insurers, allowing them to optimally deploy their capacity. Comprehensive risk assessment enables insurers to be adequately capitalised and to quickly allocate that capital in the case that an insurable event does occur. Insurers, brokers, developers, owners and investors all must work together to provide the best possible data to ensure the best possible outcome for all involved.

Dr Cristescu and her team had previously developed a solar-powered bluetooth koala ear tag, but signals from the device were only able travel 20 to 30 metres. With additional funding from WWF-Australia’s Regenerate Australia grant, Dr Cristescu and PhD candidate Kye McDonald will develop the same sized ear tag though this time using Very High Frequency (VHF) technology instead, which can be picked up for hundreds of metres.
WWF Australia
“VHF solar ear tags will enable us to locate koalas and take them into care when a large bushfire is approaching. Once the danger has passed, and their forest home is regenerating, we can return the koalas,” Dr Cristescu said.
“In those first few months after koalas are returned to the wild we can find them again and do a visual health check to make sure they’re getting enough food. If necessary we can take them back into care.
“The ear tags are light and because they’re powered by a solar panel there is no need for a battery which needs changing every six months. We believe these ear tags will last for the life of the koala.”
WWF Australia
WWF-Australia last week announced it’s invested $1.32 million into innovative projects designed to help wildlife survive and recover from bushfires, including the solar-powered koala tag project.
“As part of our vision to Regenerate Australia, we’re re-imagining how to solve the challenges facing our wildlife and wild places,” WWF-Australia’s CEO Dermot O’Gorman said.
“Bold new ideas are crucial to help restore species and landscapes, build their resilience, and adapt to a changing climate. That’s why, coming off the back of the 2020 bushfires, WWF ran a national innovation challenge – Innovate to Regenerate.
“We are investing $1.32 million in nine amazing innovators to develop the proof of concept or in some cases run a pilot or scale up their project.”
It is not clear precisely how much of the $1.32 million in funding was awarded to the solar-powered ear tag or whether the funding was evenly split between each if the nine projects, which included a temporary cardboard homes for wildlife as well as a study on the role of wombat burrows in helping animals shelter from fires and predators.

A project on the New South Wales South Coast, a region ravaged by the 2020 bushfires, attracted one of the highest proportions of the funding ($3.1 million).  The project is being led by the Australian National University and is seeking to establish ‘islandable’ microgrids which could maintain power supply in townships even if connection infrastructure to the broader grid is damaged by bushfires, as it was last year.
Several projects looking to source renewably generated electricity for remote Indigenous communities have also receive grant funding, including Ener-G Management Group’s Napranum & Muralug Microgrid projects in Queensland, Generators and Off-Grid Energy’s microgrids at Indigenous outstations in the Kimberley of Western Australia, and Original Power’s Borroloola project in the Northern Territory.
Federal energy minister, Angus Taylor, said the Regional and Remote Communities Reliability Fund will provide around $45 million for feasibility studies in over 110 communities across Australia, with a further $50 to be administered by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) to support microgrid pilot studies in regional communities.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/28/how-energytag-plans-to-revamp-the-renewable-energy-certificate-market-with-hourly-timestamps/,"MARKETS,POLICY,EUROPE",BECKY BEETZ,"JULY 28, 2021",How EnergyTag plans to revamp the renewable energy certificate market with hourly timestamps,"From pv magazine Global

Toby Ferenczi, founder, EnergyTag: My background is in renewables and startups. I completed my PhD in solar and then worked for GE. Following that, I established a U.K. startup for solar rooftop financing and installation. We sold this in 2013 to Hanergy. Through my work, I became interested in rebalancing electricity and energy storage and set up another company – a demand response aggregation platform called VCharge. This was acquired by OVO Energy, the one of the largest energy suppliers in the U.K., about four years ago. I was still interested in issues like grid balancing, how consumers buy green energy, and the enormous demand for renewables coming from individuals and corporates. So, I started digging into the difficult question of how its possible choose one type of electricity over another, given all power plants are connected to the same electrical network and you can’t physically distinguish where your electricity is coming from.
For over 20 years, there have been established systems of Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). These are called Guarantees of Origin (GO) certificates in Europe or Renewable Energy Credits in the U.S. These systems exist everywhere where you have a liberalised energy market and are the only legal way for you to claim that your energy is coming from a renewable source.
If you have a power purchase agreement (PPA) with a solar farm, but you don’t have the GO’s from that farm, then you’re not allowed to say your electricity is coming from there. The reason for that is because you need to be sure that there’s no double counting or other types of fraud – EACs provide a robust tracking and accounting system to prevent this.
PPAs can be very good for helping developers get new plants built, if the PPA is long enough, because there’s a fixed price, and the counter-party is bankable. If the corporate doesn’t have a good credit rating and isn’t able to take risk, then it’s much less valuable to developers, so only a small number of corporates can really help developers.
I concluded that the certificate system is important, but there’s quite a lot of confusion in the market, because people think, ‘Well, if I have a PPA why do I need a GO certificate?’ So, what we need to do is to enhance the current certificate schemes, and everyone who’s involved in it, along with us to build this market. We don’t want to replace the current system; we want to build a complementary one that eventually gets adopted by the existing system. The current certificate scheme has been so successful in driving adoption of renewables and so many corporates now are signing up to these certificates. There were 700 million certificates in Europe traded last year. Now they are ready to evolve as more data is now available.
The way current certificates work is by matching annual electricity consumption with annual production. This means if you use 10 MW hours of energy as a corporate consumer, for example, and I buy 10 MW hours’ worth of certificates that were produced over the same 12-month window, I can declare myself to be 100% renewable – you’re just matching your total annual consumption with total annual production, without considering the time of day it was produced. In one sense, this means you can be claiming to use solar energy at night or in winter.
It wasn’t a problem before because there wasn’t a grid balancing problem. Now we’ve got times where there’s massive overproduction of renewables, and other times where there’s not, and that’s not reflected in the current certificate prices, which are the same regardless of time of day or time of year. We know the location of the plant, when it was built and what type of electricity it produces, but not the time the electricity was produced
So, my realisation was that if you add a timestamp to the certificate and then you get consumers to match supply and demand on an hourly or half hourly basis to the power market then you create a price signal that reflects the real world availability of clean energy. Thus, the certificates can be priced according to supply and demand, meaning they’re cheap when there’s lots of renewable supply and expensive when there’s less. It’s a simple extension of the existing certificate.
It also allows corporates and individuals to send a price signal for storage, because if you’re a battery, you can buy these certificates when they’re cheap, when there’s lots of renewables on the grid, and you can sell them when they’re expensive, say at nighttime.
Demand is initially coming from corporates like Google and Microsoft, who have said ‘We want to buy clean energy on a 24/7 basis and by that we mean we want to demonstrate that every hour of the day our energy is coming from renewable sources.’ They are leading the way because they have a huge demand for data centres. The Biden administration also said they want to buy 24/7 renewables for the U.S. Federal Government. We have also got participation from the majority of large utilities in Europe, and over 100 other key organisations globally.
EnergyTag is not developing a technology, rather it’s a nonprofit that is providing a market framework. There’s a whole range of software companies out there that already have the technology to track and manage these certificates. You need access to the smart meter data and the hourly generation data, which probably wasn’t there a few years ago. But it is there now.
Some people are using blockchain to do this and some are not but it’s not really about blockchain.  The other nice thing about certificates is you don’t need to be a big corporate with a big balance sheet to participate – anyone can buy them.
It’s not a binary thing where you’re either not green or you’re 100% green, because no-one can be 100% renewable on a 24/7 basis today – that’s not how the system works. Even Google say they’re not going to get to be 24/7 carbon free until 2030. What corporates will start to say is, ‘Today we’re at 60% renewables on a 24/7 basis and next year we want to get to 70% renewables, and we’ll pay a bit extra to buy renewables in those hours where there’s less of it available.’ That sends the right price signal. The market then helps not just in terms of building more renewables but also storage. And it also has implications for lots of other things in the energy system, like scope two emissions reporting.
It’s also not just about renewables and storage deployment, it’s also about electrification. The quickest way to decarbonise is to decarbonise the power sector through renewables and then electrify everything, like transport. Granular certificates can help encourage smart charging of appliances, for instance allowing EV drivers to know that they are charging their car with renewables.
And there’s a link to green hydrogen. There’s a new suggestion from the EU that states for something to be classed as green hydrogen you need to show it was produced with renewable electricity, so you will need a certificate that states this information, which doesn’t exist today.
We have six demonstration projects underway in the U.S., Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, and Australia. The big corporates are involved, like Google and Microsoft, who are buying the energy, and the biggest utilities and grid operators in Europe, and some software companies that track and manage the certificates. The market should be up and running by the end of this year. We also regularly engage with the EU Commission, and we hope the guidelines we are writing may one day be adopted by the EU system.
It’s just another revenue stream for them, particularly those also developing storage. Developers already get money from selling traditional certificates but it’s not a massive revenue stream compared to selling the power. But we think that by moving to this more granular system, electricity certificates should be cheaper in some hours and more expensive for others which creates opportunities.
Although the prices of traditional certificates have jumped recently from a low base, we think they will play an increasingly important revenue stream for new projects and particularly project developers who are using storage and are able to produce electricity at other times. Now you’ve got price cannibalisation issues because you’ve got lots of solar in the grid and the more solar you add the more energy you’re producing in the middle of the day, which pushes down power prices and that creates an incentive to produce energy at other times.
