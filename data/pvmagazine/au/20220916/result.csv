While this brings Australia closer to the international consensus, we should be aiming to go much further, much faster.
When Prime Minister Anthony Albanese informed the United Nations of Australia’s new target, he wrote of his government’s aspiration for “even greater emission reductions in the coming decade”. But how will Australia go beyond a 43% cut to emissions? And what policies should the government implement and fund first?
A roadmap released this week by the Climate Council charts the way forward. It sets out key goals Australia should be chasing this decade, and ten climate policy “game-changers” to help get us there.

Australia’s energy grid is responsible for 33% of our national emissions. Today, 59% of our electricity comes from coal-fired power plants.
Renewables are not just a clean form of energy – they are also the cheapest form of new energy. Our analysis suggests Australia should aim to achieve 100% renewables by 2030.
We must also increase overall power generation by around 40% this decade to make steep inroads into electrifying other sectors of the economy.
1. Enable transmission infrastructure: the federal government has promised $20 billion for transmission infrastructure. This is crucial. To connect renewables to the grid, we need new transmission lines, and lots of them. The total length of transmission will need to be about 24 times what it is now.
2. Boost storage: to support grid security, we’ll need lots of electricity storage – think grid-scale batteries and pumped-hydro. To encourage greater investment the federal government should set a mandatory Renewable Energy Storage target, with specific goals for additional storage each year to 2030.
3. Upskill Australians: a new energy system will need skilled workers. The federal government must help workers upskill for clean trades through new investment in TAFE courses and electrical apprenticeships.
4. Establish a National Energy Transition Authority: this new organisation should set closure dates and develop transition plans for all coal-fired power stations by 2024, and support communities through the process.

Australia’s transport sector is responsible for 19% of national greenhouse gas emissions. By the end of this decade, transport emissions should be halved. Almost all new cars in Australia will need to be zero-emissions vehicles, and we’ll need major improvements in public and active transport infrastructure and use.
How do we get there?
5. Fuel efficiency: the federal government should implement mandatory fuel efficiency standards. Already common across the developed world, these standards encourage auto companies to supply more low and zero-emissions vehicles to the market.
The standards can be made more stringent over time, ensuring an orderly shift to zero-emissions vehicles. Without them, Australia risks becoming a dumping ground for polluting older-model cars – while the rest of the world charges ahead.
6. Ditch dirty diesel: Governments – both state and federal – need to invest in cleaner and more convenient public transport. A key first step is replacing diesel buses with a renewable electric fleet.

Some 20% of Australia’s emissions are created by the building sector. (It should be noted, this figure includes electricity consumed in buildings, which is also counted as emissions from the energy sector). To reach our climate goals we’ll need to change the way our homes, businesses and other buildings are constructed and run.
This should be done by:
7. Tightening building rules: The National Construction Code must be tightened so all new homes are net-zero emissions – through energy efficient design, rooftop solar and all-electric appliances.
By 2025 gas connections should be banned for new homes, and new gas appliances should be banned for established homes. This would ensure the move to cheaper and cleaner forms of heating and cooking.
Households will also need government support to refit their homes with electric appliances, through incentive programs and concessional finance. As Australians switch energy-efficient renewables-powered homes, they’ll save on bills.

Australia’s industrial sector creates 34% of our national emissions – and that’s excluding electricity use. These emissions must be halved, by increasing energy efficiency, electrifying processes where possible, switching fuels and phasing out fossil fuel extraction.
At the same time, we must seize new economic opportunities for industry in a future low-carbon world.
Reaching this goal will require:
8. Proper rules for big polluters: The federal government must reform what’s known as the “safeguard mechanism” to ensure big polluters do their fair share to cut emissions. This includes government incentives to drive the steepest emissions reduction possible.
Public spending must be aligned with the net-zero goal. That means:
9. No more handouts: federal and state governments spent an estimated $11.6 billion on subsidies for the fossil fuel industry last financial year, up $1.3 billion on the previous year. These handouts, such as fuel tax credits, must stop.
10. Create a climate and energy investment plan: the federal government should introduce climate budget statements outlining how taxpayer investment is aligned with the goal of rapidly reducing emissions.

Australia has already warmed by around 1.4℃ since pre-industrial times. We’re suffering significant losses from accelerating climate change, and worse is on the way.
The passing of the climate bill into law has set the floor for action. Now, we must immediately build our cleaner future – because waiting until the 2030s will be much too late.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/16/cer-investigating-potential-1-5-million-solar-panel-fraud/,"LEGAL,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2022",CER investigating potential $1.5 million solar panel fraud,"The Clean Energy Regulator (CER) confirmed on Friday that a Western Australian solar PV company is being investigated amid concerns it falsified information relating to almost 500 solar panel installations representing about $1.5 million in Small-scale Technology Certificates (STCs).
The regulator said the group, which sells and installs solar systems and operates as a Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES) agent, is under investigation for allegedly fabricating information about the responsible installer and designer of the almost 500 solar panel installations.
CER general manager of compliance Piet Powell said the search warrants aimed to uncover evidence of false information being provided to the regulator, resulting in the improper creation of STCs.
“The Clean Energy Regulator requires the very highest standards of compliance and integrity within its Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme for the financial incentives given,” she said. “Agents, installers, and retailers who fail to adequately ensure that STCs are eligible for creation or are party to the provision of false and misleading information, may face criminal, civil or administrative action.”
Powell said there no direct evidence that suggests the installations are either unsafe or sub-standard, but the CER is working with state regulators and homeowners will be contacted if evidence becomes available of concerns with installation quality.
The CER said the investigation is unrelated to the search warrants executed in September 2021 and May 2022, investigating other potentially fraudulent activity in the solar industry in WA.
The investigation caps an unhappy few days for the solar industry in WA with the state’s Consumer Protection watchdog earlier this week warning homeowners looking to install a rooftop system to beware after an increase in complaints about performance claims, shoddy systems and workmanship.

Consumer Protection said it has received 67 consumer complaints this year – up more than 10% on the same time last year – about issues such as poor-quality parts, companies not responding or providing false and misleading information, as well as installers failing to use due care and skill.
WA is home to a booming rooftop solar industry with more than 400,000  homes and businesses, or about 36% of customers in the state’s main grid, estimated to have rooftop solar. That figure is predicted to swell to 50% by 2030.
While the number of complaints received is very small compared the number of systems installed in WA this year, Consumer Protection acting executive director Penny Lipscombe said the issues are an important reminder for consumers to thoroughly research who they plan to do business with.
“Before agreeing to buy a solar system, there are a number of crucial checks that should be made, including sourcing independent reviews and making sure your preferred supplier is accredited by searching the Clean Energy Council’s website,” she said.
“If a supplier’s verbal claims are influencing your decision, make sure to have them included in the written contract and read through all the terms and conditions.
“Solar installers are not allowed to use forceful or high-pressured sales tactics to get you to buy something, nor can they provide you with false or misleading information. They must also ensure their products and services meet the consumer guarantees.”
The system’s electrical components must be installed by a licensed electrician working under a licensed electrical contractor.
“You should ask to see these licences and expect to receive an electrical safety certificate for the work,” Lipscombe said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/16/yara-confirms-construction-of-pilbara-green-hydrogen-plant-to-begin-in-weeks/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2022",Yara confirms construction of Pilbara green hydrogen plant to begin in weeks,"Pilbara ammonia producer Yara and Engie Australia have declared the way is now clear for construction to begin on the Yuri green hydrogen project which will provide feedstock into the Yara ammonia operations on the Burrup Peninsula in Western Australia’s (WA) northwest following the final investment decision on the renewables project.
The project partners said on Friday they will install a 10 MW electrolyser and 18 MW of solar PV coupled with an 8 MW/5 MWh lithium-ion battery energy storage system for firming.
The plant will be built on the existing Yara Pilbara lease near Karratha, with the supply of renewables to shift the neighbouring ammonia plant’s dependence on natural gas to green hydrogen.
Once completed, the project will be one of Australia’s largest electrolysers, capable of producing up to 640 tonnes of green hydrogen each year. The largest electrolyser currently operating in Australia is Australian Gas Network’s 1.25 MW hydrogen plant at Tonsley Park in South Australia.
Yara said construction would begin on the Yuri project next month with production of green hydrogen scheduled to commence in 2024.
Yara Clean Ammonia president Magnus Krogh Ankarstrand said the processing plant would be the first established operational facilities in WA to receive and use green hydrogen to produce clean ammonia.

Yara Pilbara general manager Laurent Trost said the project would be transformational for the company’s processing operations which comprise the ammonia plant and a technical ammonium nitrate facility.
“Yuri is a key step in the decarbonisation of our operations which already supply markets in Asia and Australia,” he said.
The final investment decision follows the federal government’s announcement on Friday that it will pump $47.5 million through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) Renewable Hydrogen Deployment Funding Round into the Yuri green hydrogen project. The Western Australian government has also supported the project with a $2 million grant contribution from the state’s Renewable Hydrogen Fund.
Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the Yuri project marks a step-change in scale towards Australia’s vision of becoming a renewable energy superpower.
“This will help advance Australia towards becoming a world leader in hydrogen generation,” Bowen said. “As we move to a more renewable economy, hydrogen will become an increasingly important part of our energy mix and will be important in supporting industrial and hard to abate sectors.”
WA Hydrogen Industry Minister Alannah MacTiernan welcomed the final investment decision from Engie and Yara, describing it as “an important milestone for WA’s growing renewable hydrogen industry”.
“Yara Pilbara Fertilisers is a world-scale facility, and the project will demonstrate WA’s ability to produce renewable hydrogen on an industrial scale,” she said.
A consortium of Perth-based construction firm Monford Group and French engineering and technology company has been awarded the engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning contract for the renewable hydrogen plant.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/16/study-shows-switching-to-renewables-by-2050-would-save-world-trillions/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2022",Study shows switching to renewables by 2050 would save world trillions,"Described by the research team as a ‘win-win-win scenario’, the study shows that rapidly transitioning to renewable energy would result in lower energy system costs than a fossil fuel system, while also providing more energy to the global economy and expanding energy access to more people internationally.
The study’s ‘fast transition’ scenario shows a realistic possible future for a fossil-free energy system by about 2050, the researchers said, providing 55% more ‘energy services’ compared to today. This would be accomplished by ramping up solar, wind, batteries, electric vehicles, and clean fuels such as green hydrogen.
Lead author Dr Rupert Way, from Oxford University’s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, said past models predicting high costs for transitioning to zero carbon energy have deterred companies from investing, and made governments nervous about setting policies that will accelerate the energy transition and cut reliance on fossil fuels.
“But clean energy costs have fallen sharply over the last decade, much faster than those models expected,” he said. “Our latest research shows scaling-up key green technologies will continue to drive their costs down, and the faster we go, the more we will save.
“Accelerating the transition to renewable energy is now the best bet, not just for the planet, but for energy costs too.”

The researchers said they analysed thousands of transition cost scenarios produced by major energy models and used data on 45 years of solar energy costs, 37 years of wind energy costs and 25 years for battery storage.
They found the real cost of solar energy dropped twice as fast as the most ambitious projections in these models, at a rate approaching 10% a year, revealing that over the past 20 years previous models badly overestimated the future costs of key clean energy technologies versus reality.
Professor Doyne Farmer, from the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, said there is a “pervasive misconception” that switching to clean energy will be costly.
“That’s just wrong,” he said. “Renewable costs have been trending down for decades. They are already cheaper than fossil fuels in many situations, and our research shows they will become cheaper than fossil fuels across almost all applications in the years to come.
“And, if we accelerate the transition, they will become cheaper faster. Completely replacing fossil fuels with clean energy by 2050 will save us trillions.”

The study shows the costs for key storage technologies, such as batteries and hydrogen electrolysis, are also likely to fall dramatically.
“This study shows ambitious policies to accelerate dramatically the transition to a clean energy future, as quickly as possible, are not only urgently needed for climate reasons, but can save the world trillions in future energy costs, giving us a cleaner, cheaper, more energy-secure future,” Farmer said.
The research has been published in the journal Joule and is a collaboration between the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, the Oxford Martin Programme on the Post-Carbon Transition, the Smith School of Enterprise & Environment at the University of Oxford, and SoDa Labs at Monash University.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/16/uk-startup-unveils-solar-trees-for-commercial-industrial-areas/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2022","UK startup unveils solar trees for commercial, industrial areas","U.K. startup SolarBotanic Trees has designed a photovoltaic tree for applications in commercial and industrial buildings.
“The tree will be using monocrystalline cells with an efficiency of up to 24% which are encapsulated in a 3D shape to give an aesthetically pleasing design,” the company’s chief product officer, Gerard Jansen, told pv magazine. “A series of these 3D-shaped ‘leafs’ together form the canopy which has a total diameter of 5 meters. The first version doesn’t use trackers but the cost-benefit of this is being analyzed for use in the future.”
The system is based on a supporting structure that makes use of a mixture of materials, including carbon fiber, metal and polymers. And according to the manufacturer, it is designed for quick and easy installation, so it can be packed for efficient shipment.
“The production is primarily in the UK and the product will be rolled out gradually capturing the largest global markets in a strategic way considering certification and logistic requirements,” Jansen said. “The target market for the tree is the commercial and industrial sector where the Tree brings aesthetic value to the surrounding real estate.”
Prices range from GBP 12,000 ($14,080) to GBP 16,000. The cost of the versions with energy storage and EV charging capabilities will depend on the energy and power capacity of the integrated hardware.
“This first-generation SolarBotanic Tree will eventually spawn a family of products, primarily aimed at the rapid Electric Vehicle charging market for homes, businesses and commercial car parks, where solar power can be captured and stored for charging points,” the startup said. “It will also encompass a sophisticated AI-driven energy storage and power management system (PMS), where trees can be linked and form part of a local grid, or feed into the main grid, essential to optimize an increasingly electrified future.”
The company plans to start selling the first systems in early 2023. It developed the solar tree technology in partnership with Co-Innovate, an initiative supporting small- and medium-sized enterprises in London by using academic and innovation resources at Brunel University London and the Manufacturing Technology Centre (MTC) in Coventry.
Despite their higher costs compared to conventional PV installations, solar trees might have a strategic advantage, as they occupy less space. According to recent research from South Korea, solar trees can possibly capture carbon and produce energy at the same time.

The platform will provide end-to-end green solutions to consumers, including connectivity to the appropriate transmission network. 
The company plans to install and commission 1.5 GW of solar and wind capacity in India in 24 months. It will build this capacity across multiple sites in the states of Karnataka, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra, where it has already acquired connectivity approvals. A large part of this capacity will be used to deliver close to 600 MW of round-the-clock clean energy to various entities of the Vedanta Group. 
Hindustan Zinc, an arm of Vedanta Group unit, signed an agreement on 2 September with special-purpose vehicle Serentica Renewables India for long-term delivery of up to 200 MW of renewables.
“Serentica will also participate selectively in Government tenders subject to the project having synergies with its overall focus of providing direct green energy solutions to commercial and industrial customers,” the company said.
Over the medium-term, Serentica aims to install 5 GW of clean energy, coupled with different storage technologies. Eventually, it aims to supply more than 15 billion units of clean energy per year and displace 20 million tons of CO2 emissions. 
Serentica Renewables is 100% owned by Twinstar Overseas Ltd., a unit of  Volcan Investments. Twinstar Overseas also owns controlling stakes in Sterlite Power Transmission and Sterlite Technologies.
