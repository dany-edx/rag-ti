The two non-binding deals come off the back of promising results from Gold Hydrogen’s maiden drilling campaign at its Ramsay project in South Australia’s Yorke Peninsula. In early November, the company revealed it had discovered “significant concentrations of hydrogen and helium” at the Ramsay site.

The full drilling campaign is still in progress, meaning both deals will hinge on the final results. If those results come back successful, Gold Hydrogen says the MoUs will allow it to fast-track its proof-of-concept pilot at the site.
The ‘concept’ Gold Hydrogen is referring to here is whether natural hydrogen can indeed be produced from the subsurface as part of a raw gas stream, and then processed at the surface to yield a high purity hydrogen gas to be used as an energy source.
The MoUs pertain to Gold Hydrogen working with Wasco Energy and H2Site to review suitable hydrogen purification systems to produce compressed hydrogen on site.
“This would represent an important step in the process of enable the full potential of the Ramsay area to be evaluated from a commercial perspective, and would also create the first natural hydrogen pilot plant in Australia,” the company announced to the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/08/australian-researchers-delve-into-lithium-microstructures-causing-catastrophic-battery-failures/,"ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 8, 2023",Australian researchers delve into lithium microstructures causing catastrophic battery failures,"Lithium microstructures that form at the lithium surface can create short circuits and lead to catastrophic battery failure – a phenomenon which led ANSTO researchers to use small-angle and ultra-small-angle neutron scattering techniques to better study the complex structures.
To cater to next-generation technologies, the energy density of lithium batteries must increase. The problem is that while replacing common electrodes with pure lithium metal achieves this, the associated lithium microstructures increase the battery’s susceptibility to failure.
“It is important to understand how and why these detrimental lithium structures form in order to prevent them from forming and ultimately enable us to use these types of higher energy batteries,” lead scientist Professor Vanessa Peterson said.
Lithium microstructures come in different forms, including ‘whiskers,’ ‘moss,’ and ‘dendrites.’ Whiskers resemble tiny needles, moss looks like a porous layer, and dendrites are long, thin structures – and it is these ‘pointy’ structures that cause the most trouble, the researchers say.
Using small-angle and ultra-small-angle neutron scattering (SANS and USANS) techniques afforded the researchers a more precise and less complicated way to analyse the structure of deposited lithium compared to methods like X-ray imaging, microscopy, or gas adsorption.
“We observed that the surface area and interfacial distances of deposited lithium change in complex ways depending on the history of the battery’s use,” Professor Peterson said.
“This research opens the door for future investigations to explore how factors like the amount of electric current, charging time, and the cyclic process of lithium deposition and dissolution impact the surface area and the distances between interfaces within deposited lithium.
“Understanding these factors is crucial for addressing the challenges associated with lithium dendrite growth in LMB technology,” she added.
The method also allowed the researchers to understand the size and shape of the lithium structures inside a battery without taking it apart. “This information helped us design a symmetrical pouch cell that was ideal for studying the changes in the lithium that gets deposited inside it.”
The research has been published in Advanced Energy Materials.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/08/hydrogen-powered-vertical-takeoff-aircraft-from-sydney-startup-backed-by-arena/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 8, 2023",Hydrogen-powered vertical takeoff aircraft from Sydney startup backed by ARENA,"AMSL Aero, founded by a husband and wife, is expanding its green aviation endeavours after attracting almost half the funding it needs to demonstrate a hydrogen-powered vertical take off aircraft from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).
The $10.86 million (USD 6.95 million) hydrogen aircraft project follows AMSL’s successful demonstration of a similar, though battery-only aircraft, which it has dubbed Vertiia.
By integrating a hydrogen fuel cell system into the Vertiia aircraft the company says it will greatly expand the aircraft’s range, moving it from around 250 km to as much as 1000 km. With such a range, the aircraft could then be used in regional Australia for emergency services, including air ambulance, freight and transport. The company says the aircraft’s configuration could also be useful in specialised situations, including fighting bushfires.
The ARENA grant, backed by the federal government, will support AMSL’s development and certification activities for the aircraft, and is anticipated to culminate in a successful demonstration with a test flight of the prototype. The company is aiming for a demonstration in 2025, and potentially commercial availability in 2026.
The move into using hydrogen as a fuel will not only increase the range of the Vertiia aircraft, it will also allow it to refuel much faster, making it more practical and economical.
AMSL Aero was founded in 2017 and is based at Sydney’s Bankstown Airport. The investment in the company is ARENA’s first foray into hydrogen powered aviation.
The aviation sector is responsible for around 2.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with nearly a fifth coming from short haul flights under 1000km.

Province is still in the feasibility studies phase, but is proposing to produce 550,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per annum, with phase 1 of the HyEnergy project aiming to install between 4 GW and 5 GW of solar and wind to support its electrolysers. 
Province Resources (ASX: PRL) announced to the stock exchange this week that the area earmarked for its HyEnergy development has been “further defined,” with the Western Australian government providing additional licences to support studies on land and water.

These licenses include over 864 hectares of the seabed near Carnarvon, allowing the company to completed detailed feasibility studies into building a port for green hydrogen export.
The company is in fact exploring two different export options at the moment. The first is a traditional loading jetty port. Province’s proposed port would be located about 20km north of Carnarvon, adjacent to an area known locally as the Town Common, it says. The second option is an undersea pipeline that would allow for offshore ship loading via a floating buoy. It has partnered with fellow WA company Provaris to explore this option.
The new license, the company says, is for an initial two-year term and provides for ongoing technical and environmental marine studies and investigations to be completed, presumably helping the company land on its preferred export route.

The company has also been awarded additional licenses on land covering two pastoral stations. Also for an initial two-year period, these licenses, the company says, “allow for ongoing environmental, geotechnical and heritage surveys to be completed along with placement of wind and solar monitoring equipment.”
“Province now holds Section 91 licences covering all or part of six pastoral stations and the Town Common. Together these licences make up an area of more than 600,000 hectares,” Province says.
Province CEO and Managing Director, David Frances, said the company now had sufficient areas under licence to support an initial development based on the Town Common, and the ability to scale-up to a multi-gigawatt project which would incorporate the six pastoral leases.
“We continue to engage with the Western Australian government to obtain the appropriate secure tenure which will eventually be required over the project area,” Frances added.
Province Resources was originally a gold and nickel exploration company.

Chinese battery and solar module manufacturer BYD has recently developed a bifacial photovoltaic panel for agrivoltaics, a company spokesperson has told pv mazagine.
The company developed the new “Bem-te-vi” panel at the BYD module factory located in Campinas, near Sao Paulo, Brazil. It has a power output of 340 W to 355 W and a 16.33% power conversion efficiency. It uses 36 half-cut, 23%-efficient monocrystalline PERC cells and features a multi-busbar architecture.
BYD energy spokesperson, Edson Pozzonbon, told pv magazine that the panel also features a transparent backsheet. “The panels can form greenhouses or enclosures, optimising the use of space and allowing the passage of light to the crops,” he said.
BYD will deploy these new panels at a 100 kW agrivoltaic array at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) in Brazil.
Pozzonbon said commercially the panels will be offered as an “integrated energy solution” alongside inverters, battery storage systems and electric trucks. The sale of the combination package aims to fix the issue of Frankenstein solar systems, he said, which is a “problem” in Brazil. This is when a solar arrangement utilises different companies’ products and can lead to issues “establishing a connection between different equipment,” Pozzonbon said.
The BYD factory in Campinas reopened in 2022. It was upgraded with production equipment for modules based on multi-busbar, half-cell, and 1/3 cut cells. It has now an annual capacity of 500 MW and produces panels with power outputs ranging from 450 W to 670 W.
The factory opened in 2017 with an annual capacity of 200 MW, with the support of Apex-Brasil, the Brazilian government’s trade and investment promotion agency. Solar projects that feature Brazilian-made components can obtain financing from the Brazilian Development Bank and Banco do Nordeste.

Longi said this week that it has achieved a power conversion efficiency of 33.9% for a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell.
The company said that NREL has confirmed the results, which represent a world record for this cell typology. The previous record was held by Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), which achieved a 33.7% efficiency for a device with the same configuration in June.
“The theoretical efficiency of perovskite-silicon tandem cells is 43%, which makes them the most feasible alternative to current mono-junction silicon cells,” said Longi President Li Zhenguo, without providing technical details.
In June, Longi reported an efficiency of 33.5% for the same cell. The European Solar Test Installation (ESTI) certified the results, which represented a significant increase on its previous 31.8% efficiency rating, which was announced during the SNEC conference in late May in Shanghai, China.
Longi has broken the world record for solar cell efficiency 15 times since April 2021. It claimed the world’s highest efficiency for silicon cells in November 2022, with a 26.81% efficiency rating for an unspecified heterojunction solar cell.
