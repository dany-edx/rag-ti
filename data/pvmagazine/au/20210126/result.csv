While the proposals are, for now, little more than best laid plans, Cornwall Insight Australia’s Principal Consultant, Ben Cerini, said announcements of such large capacities being integrated into the National Electricity Market (NEM) inevitably makes developers take notice.
“The NEM will only be able to integrate a certain capacity of storage assets before pricing begins to cannibalise itself,” Cerini told pv magazine Australia. It is, however, still too soon to truly ascertain how saturated Australia’s jurisdiction are becoming.
“We know that these projects are likely to take several years to get permitted and built and are usually announced in much larger sizes than the projects that get built.”
Cerini says the market’s faster-than-expected battery storage rollout means it’s likely the NEM will have access to more storage assets to solve anticipated grid issues, but adds the proof will be in the pudding.
“The major shift in the market will come when a number of these larger projects reach the construction phase.”
“There are many developers and gentailers that are obtaining permits undertaking technical or grid studies to ascertain the best places to incorporate storage, but this doesn’t mean construction will begin tomorrow. As we saw with the fallout from the renewables rush, developers need to make sure that they are developing these assets in the best locations given the technical, regulatory and economic landscape to make sure the viability of their asset is robust to market changes.”
Australia’s position as the world-leader of solar penetration coupled with its arcane grid has made it a hotbed for energy storage innovation and investment. If just 10% of Cornwalls projected 7 GW  storage pipeline is completed by 2024, it would result in a capacity more than 13x the Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) forecast in its Integrated System Plan (ISP). 
As Cerini also notes, the battery storage forecast by AEMO focuses on reliability of the grid, overlooking many of the services a big battery can provide.
“[Frequency Control Ancillary Services] FCAS markets are a large driver of revenues for large scale battery assets in the NEM… Last calendar year FCAS revenues accounted for more than 90% of revenues at Ballarat ESS (c.f. to ~80% in CY19) and more than 96% for Hornsdale Power Reserve (c.f. 83% in CY19).”
“We know there are multiple rule changes that are developing new system services or ‘essential services’ under the Energy Security Boards Post 2025 Market Design work, including Fast Frequency Response, Primary Frequency Response, Inertia services, System Strength (i.e. voltage oscillation, fault levels or voltage collapse etc.), system integrity protection schemes, peak load reduction at specific network points, congestion alleviation. There is also likely to be new non-ancillary service that batteries could participate in including an operational reserve market.
As we may find, Victoria and South Australia are the first states to see the full impact storage can have on market outcomes and whether or not the current rule changes will allow for trading optimisation with co-located assets behind the connection point.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/26/global-companies-win-award-for-australian-vpp-grid-support-program/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 26, 2021",Global companies win award for Australian VPP grid support program,"The award was given to Enel X for its work with Digital Realty, which has enrolled two of its Australian sites in Enel X’s VPP, which has allowed the company to innovate how it consumes energy to support the grid security and reliability.
The award, which recognises cutting-edge technology solutions, was given to the companies for the innovative way the two data centres have been made available to switch over to their uninterruptible power source (UPS) and backup generation, allowing additional capacity as part of the VPP. This is done to both build resilience and reduce pressure on the grid at peak times.
“By participating in Enel X’s VPP, we have improved our mission critical infrastructure to ensure the highest standard of preparation in case of a power grid failure. VPP participation gives a true test of mission critical equipment, including UPS and backup generation assets, with the safety net of grid power to switch back to if required,” Vice President of Operations for Digital Realty’s Asia Pacific region, Jon Curry, said in a statement.
Enel X is one of a number of companies to jump aboard the VPP train in Australia, cashing in on the growing market seeking to stabilise Australia’s notoriously rickety grids. The company’s Head of Asia and Oceania, Jeff Renaud, told the Australian Financial Review last year that its ambition was to become the largest frequency control and ancillary services (FCAS) supplier in the country.
Enel X works with a number of commercial and industrial businesses to deliver the aggregated “virtual capacity” from all participants to the grid, but as the companies outlined in the statement, Digital Realty did not require capital expenditure investment in additional equipment to participate in the VPP, and instead uses existing assets and receives availability payments for being on call.
Data centres more broadly are well suited to VPP participation because they use a large volume of electricity that is relatively consistent, providing a predictable amount of load to support the grid when needed. They can transfer to their reliable backup power sources quickly and completely in case of a grid outage.
“Being on call to use less energy from the grid at critical times is fundamental to enabling more power generation from intermittent renewables like solar and wind, which reduce carbon emissions and the cost of energy for all consumers. Participation also helps to prevent larger power outages and reduces the need to build more carbon-emitting power plants. We are thankful to Digital Realty and their supportive customers for leading the way in this space,” Renaud said in the statement.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/26/japanese-giant-backs-qld-green-hydrogen-plant-and-omani-grey-hydrogen-competitor/,"HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,JAPAN,OMAN",BLAKE MATICH,"JANUARY 26, 2021",Japanese giant backs QLD green hydrogen plant and Omani grey hydrogen competitor,"Back in February 2020, the traditional coal and gas hub of Gladstone, Queensland (QLD), put its hand up among the many raised palms in Australia to become the country’s hydrogen mecca. The city was selected to host two ambitious projects, including a gigawatt-scale green hydrogen and ammonia project and a gas injection facility to blend green hydrogen into the city’s natural gas network. 
This week, Japanese corporate giant the Sumitomo Corporation has announced that it has signed a Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) contract with engineering company JGC Holdings Corporation (JSC Group) for a solar-powered green hydrogen production plant in Gladstone. 
The plant plans to produce 250-300 tonnes of hydrogen annually, and could scale up in the future. In a statement, the Sumitomo Corporation said that it “expects hydrogen to be one of the important energies in the future, and promotes hydrogen related business such as local production and consumption projects and large scale value chain projects, that utilises the regional requirements of energy and the characteristics of hydrogen. 
It is perhaps not surprising the Sumitomo Corporation is turning strongly to hydrogen, and green hydrogen to boot, considering the company’s stunning US$250 million loss on its Western Australian Bluewaters coal fired power station. The loss ensured that 2020 was the company’s worst ever annual performance. 
The 434 MW Bluewaters coal-fired power station is Western Australia’s (WA) newest coal power station, completed in 2009 and generates approximately 15% of the state’s energy. Interestingly, it is WA’s only privately-owned coal-fired power station. According to a report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), the rapidly accelerating transition to renewables has ensured that Sumitomo is now left holding a stranded asset. 
JSC Group said that it “is making extensive efforts to expand the use of hydrogen energy, which is expected to be an energy source that does not emit CO2, when burned, and ammonia, which is expected to be one of the most promising hydrogen energy carriers in hydrogen transportation, where there are issues from an economic and safety perspective.” 
“In addition, we are proposing a hydrogen production system that will produce hydrogen from synthetic gas made from waste plastics, in order to continue to contribute to the realisation of a hydrogen society in Japan and abroad.” 
Competition from Oman
On the same day that the Sumitomo Corporation announced its Gladstone plans for a hydrogen production plant, the Japanese conglomerate also announced the commencement of a feasibility study on a grey-green hydrogen hybrid project in Oman. 
Sumitomo Corporation previously had a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with major Omani oil and gas producer, ARA Petroleum LLC (ARA), and now discussions on the project have commenced with this feasibility study. 
Using natural gas to produce grey hydrogen ARA hopes to commence operations in 2023, with the plan of producing 300-400 tonnes of grey hydrogen annually. The hybridity of the project comes with the addition of a 20 MW solar installation to power the site and hydrogen production facilities. 
Professor of Future Energy Systems at TU Delft in the Netherlands, Ad van Wijk, told pv magazine that Oman has great hydrogen prospects. “Very good solar resources,” said Wijk, and “they have the industry…that’s the interesting thing, due to the gas and other fossil fuel industries the harbour facilities may not be in place for hydrogen as such, but for ammonia they are in place…they make the hydrogen from natural gas and then make ammonia and ship it.” 
Oman already has the industry to service this hydrogen production plant then. At the outset, hydrogen industry has a lot in common with the fossil fuel industry. “Of course,” continued Wijk, “in a certain sense that (fossil fuel industry) is the enemy…but you could also say this is a lucky circumstance because we don’t have to develop a hydrogen industry from scratch. For example, the solar PV industry had to be developed from scratch because it was not there, but that is not the case with the total supply chain for hydrogen.” 
Oman, like Saudi Arabia, will look to provide Australia with stiff competition in the hydrogen economy throughout the Asia-Pacific. Initially, says Wijk, grey and blue hydrogen will be able to supply the market more easily and cheaply than green hydrogen, however this advantage will probably only last a few years. Eventually, solar and wind will be so cheap that they will out-compete fossil fuels.
