The company is now looking to prove its technology can be integrated with more powerful batteries, with its eyes ultimately on the European electric vehicle market.

In 2021, Altech produced and tested a series of lithium-ion battery anode materials which had a ~30% higher retention capacity compared to conventional lithium-ion battery anode materials. To achieve this, the combined silicon particles that had been treated with its proprietary coating technology, with regular battery grade graphite, to produce a lithium-ion battery electrode containing a composite graphite / silicon anode. When energised, these materials held 30% more capacity compared to a conventional graphite only anode material, the company said, adding the batteries also had increased cyclability. 
The battery performance testing was conducted with only the industry standard coin cell rechargeable lithium-ion batteries though – which the company noted has its limitations.
Since that trial, Altech has fitted its Perth laboratories with a pouch cell production and testing facility. (A pouch cell is a common design of a lithium-ion battery.)
It has also commissioned a larger-scale tube furnace at the lab. It is hoping these expanded facilities will help it prove its trademarked Silumina Anodes technology.
Alongside its Perth R&D, the ASX-listed company is progressing plans to develop a high purity alumina (HPA) battery material coating plant in Germany. To that end, Altech’s 75%-owned subsidiary, Altech Industries Germany, has commenced a definitive feasibility study for the development of a 10,000 tonne per annum silicon/graphite alumina coating plant in Saxony.
The company is also pursuing a project in Malaysia, aiming to build a 4,500 tonne per annum high purity alumina (HPA) processing plant at Johor. Feedstock for the plant will be sourced from Altech’s kaolin deposit at Meckering, in WA, and shipped to Malaysia. 
Altech has already released a Final Investment Decision Study for the Malaysian project, and has secured a US$190 million (AU$275m) loan with German owned state bank KfW IPEX-Bank. It continues to negotiate US$100m of Green Corporate Bonds, as well as US$100m equity stake in this project, in order to finalise construction.

An established company, Powin has worked on a number of major projects in the US and recently inked supply deals in countries like Taiwan. Akaysha said it chose Powin as its storage system supply partner because of its vertical integration and and software, adding the two companies have been working together for some months now on the grid interconnection process in Australia.
During the acquisition of Akaysha earlier this month, world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, said it would commit over $1 billion (AUD) to support the build out of over 1 GW of battery storage assets across Australia.
Akaysha has a portfolio of nine projects, though only three of those have been publicly announced. Those include a 150 MW / 300 MWh Ulinda Park battery project in Queensland’s Western Downs region west of Brisbane, a grid forming Palmerston Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) in Tasmania, and a Orana battery with between 200 MW to 400 MW of capacity and 1600 MWh of storage planned for Wellington in central-west New South Wales.
In total, Akaysha says it has more than 3 GWh of energy storage capacity in its portfolio – which a billion in backing capital would no doubt help see deployed.
“It is critical to have a diverse competitive landscape in the Australian ESS market,” Akaysha’s Managing Director, Nick Carter, said. “Powin’s vertically integrated and flexible business model reduces project cost and risk by having multiple trusted cell suppliers, proprietary software, and an in-house power plant controller.”
The companies also noted the recently signed Australia – United States Net-Zero Technology Acceleration Partnership, announced in July in an effort to safeguard energy supply chains through firming trade ties between political allies.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/31/unreliable-decade-looms-renewable-projects-and-transmission-urgently-needed-as-australia-stares-down-coal-closures/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,POLICY,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"AUGUST 31, 2022",Decade of unreliability: renewable projects and transmission ‘urgently’ needed as Australia stares down coal closures,"The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has released its annual modelling of potential market shortfalls known as the 2022 Electricity Statement of Opportunities report, framing the need for new generation, storage and transmission projects in Australia this decade as “urgent.”
This urgency is due to the fact the National Electricity Market (NEM), the grid which serves New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania, is set to have 14% of its capacity withdrawn with the retirement of five coal power stations, which account for 8.3 GW of generation.

This loss of capacity, and with it the system strength which comes from a network dominated by thermal generation, is worrying for AEMO as it considers Australia has just 8.6 GW of committed replacements. While slightly more than the lost capacity, this number is tight and is – as the agency frequently notes – subject to potential delays.
Australia does, however, have a pretty hefty pipeline of projects in planning – of which AEMO deems 3.4 GW ‘anticipated’ – likely to be built – and another 165 GW simply ‘proposed.’

With AEMO considering only existing and “committed” projects (certainly a conservative outlook), it forecasts reliability gaps could occur in South Australia as early as next year, with Victoria following suit from 2024-25.
Slightly further down the line and on a more serious note, AEMO says New South Wales is forecast to “breach the reliability standard” from 2025-26, followed by Victoria (2028-29), Queensland (2029-30) and South Australia (2031-32).
While that all sounds rather spooky, AEMO’s CEO Daniel Westerman noted: “Despite the challenging reliability outlook against ‘committed’ projects, should the 3.4 GW of anticipated generation and storage projects, alongside ISP actionable transmission projects, be delivered to their current schedules, then reliability standards would be met in all regions of the NEM until later in the decade when more large thermal generators exit,” Mr Westerman said.

Adding to the delicacy of the situation, the oncoming wave of coal plant retirements – which is happening even sooner than planned in AEMO’s 2021 report –  will coincide with a jump in electricity demand as houses and businesses electrify their appliances and electric vehicle uptake grows. 
Considering the proposed pipeline is bulging at 165 GW, it seems like getting enough replacement generation in the system is doable, if it can be done quickly – but adding enough transmission to enable the green electricity to flow remains an issue.

“The five transmission projects identified in the 2022 Integrated System Plan – HumeLink, VNI West, Marinus Link, Sydney Ring and New England REZ Transmission Link – should progress as urgently as possible to enable electricity consumers to make shared use of existing and future generation and storage,” Westerman said.
AEMO’s report mentions delays frequently, though there isn’t much discussion about what it sees as the major cause of these delays. Opposition to both transmission and large-scale projects does appear to be getting more organised in Australia and is certainly something with the potential to blow out expected timelines.

On the other side of things, big projects tend to run into their own hurdles with AEMO flagging that since last year’s report, Project EnergyConnect – a transmission project linking South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria – has pushed back its timeline, starting early stage developments a year later than expected, aiming for 2024-25, rather than 2023-24.
The major Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project also appears to be a sore spot, though AEMO repeatedly notes “despite media reports suggesting a delay to the project, Snowy Hydro has not confirmed any adjustment to its previously provided commissioning schedule.”
Be that as it may, the report modelled a two year delay but found it would have a pretty minimal impact on reliability forecasts.

The recent change in government and the last few months of energy minister meetings, which have seen state and federal leaders come together to enshrine emissions reduction as an objective for the national electricity system, as well as revisions to project financing and energy transition planning, was noted by AEMO as greatly “improving the investment environment” and enabling the NEM’s transformation.
“Governments also have a range of measures to bring in new generation, storage and transmission, which will greatly aid the short- to medium-term outlook. As these become committed, they will be incorporated into future reliability assessments, and will reduce the reliability risks presently forecast,” Westerman said.

The project is being led by Professor Gerhard Swiegers, the same professor behind the discovery that green hydrogen could be produced up to 20% more efficiently using capillary-fed electrolysis. That technology is currently being commercialised by startup Hysata, also based in Wollongong, for which Professor Swiegers is the Chief Technical Officer.

Hysata is also involved in the university’s grant funded project which Professor Sweigers says will study the capillary-fed electrochemical cell architecture in the facilitation of various electro-energy and electro-synthetic transformations.
“The new cell architecture will be examined as a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell and as a cell for extracting pure hydrogen from a 5% to 10% mixture of hydrogen in methane,” he said. 
“The work seeks to improve upon the electrochemical performance of the best commercial and academic cells of such types.”
“In increasing the efficiency with which renewable electricity can be converted into renewable hydrogen and back, this project will support the national priority of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.”
It is not clear exactly how much of the total $1.2 million grant will go specifically to this project, with the other two funded projects in the fields of creative arts and mining sciences.

Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, said this week that the company’s 10 GW solar cell and module factory in Jamnagar, Gujarat, will start production by 2024. The group will then scale its annual output capacity to 20 GW by 2026 in a phased manner.
Reliance Industries said it will use REC Solar‘s technology for solar manufacturing at the Jamnagar factory. 
“This will be a first-of-its-kind of ‘quartz-to-module’ facility globally,” said Ambani, addressing the company’s annual general meeting (AGM) this week.
He said Reliance Industries would also invest in glass and POE film manufacturing. It claims to have a defined technology improvement roadmap to stay ahead in PV manufacturing.
“We target to increase the HJT module efficiency to 26% by 2026 from the current 23%, and further improve it to 28% through innovations like perovskite-tandem cell technology,” said Ambani. 
Reliance Industries also aims to extend the lifetime of PV modules from 25 to 50 years, to set a high benchmark for quality and reliability. In June 2021, the company announced plans to manufacture and fully integrate all the critical components of the renewable energy ecosystem. The plan included gigafactories for PV panels, energy storage, electrolysers for green hydrogen, and fuel cells.
A spree of mergers and acquisitions has since marked Reliance Industries’ foray into those segments. For solar PV manufacturing, it acquired a 100% stake in REC Solar and its heterojunction solar panels. Ambani said Reliance Industries aims to make India a world leader in new energy manufacturing, as well as a credible alternative to China.
“We are well on our way to creating a manufacturing ecosystem [in the new energy segment], which will be fully integrated with secure and self-sufficient supply chains,” he said. “It will be backed by world-class talent and capabilities, built on the pillars of technological innovation through strategic partnerships. It will deliver modular, world-scale, affordable, and most modern green energy manufacturing business based in India, for India and the world.”
Ambani also announced a new gigafactory for power electronics – one of the key components linking the entire value chain of green energy.
“We are building significant capabilities in design and manufacturing of power electronics and software systems, integrating with our capabilities of telecommunications, cloud computing and IoT,” said Ambani. “[Reliance Industries] aims to start production of battery packs by 2023 and scale up to a fully integrated 5 GWh annual cell-to-pack manufacturing facility by 2024, and further scale up to 50 GWh annual capacity by 2027.” 
For green hydrogen, Reliance Industries has partnered with Stiesdal to accelerate cost reduction and commercialisation of their pressurised alkaline electrolyser technology.
“We are also in advanced discussions to partner with other leading electrolyser technology players globally to set up a giga-scale electrolyser manufacturing facility at Jamnagar,” said Ambani.

Toronto-based Hydrostor has revealed that it has selected Kiewit Engineering Group to advance front-end engineering and design studies for the 500 MW/4 GWh Willow Rock Energy Storage Center. Once completed, the site will be the largest standalone energy storage project in California.
The installation will feature Hydrostor’s Advanced Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES) technology. The company said its equipment can provide affordable, emissions-free long-duration energy storage (LDES). The project will store enough energy to provide power to 400,000 homes over eight-hour durations, storing intermittent wind and solar energy.
Hydrostor’s technology features a four-step process to store and dispatch energy. It initially pulls off-peak or surplus energy from the grid, producing heated compressed air. Then, the heat is extracted from the air stream, and stored inside a thermal store, preserving the energy for later use.
The compressed air is then stored in a tank that via the hydrostatic compensation process to maintain constant pressure during operation.  When the energy needs to be dispatched, pressure forces air to the surface, where it is then recombined with heat, and sent through a turbine, producing dispatchable electricity.
“Hydrostor continues to reach important milestones at Willow Rock, and we look forward to working with the world-class engineering and construction teams at Kiewit to advance this critical clean energy project. Our global teams are paving the way towards achieving aggressive net-zero goals.” said Curtis VanWalleghem, Hydrostor’s chief executive officer. “Willow Rock will be capable of eliminating the equivalent of roughly 120,000 cars off the road every year.”
In January, Hydrostor announced a preferred equity financing commitment of US$250 million from Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Goldman Sachs will fund its investment in tranches tied to project milestones to match Hydrostor’s capital needs and accelerate project execution. The funds will also support the company’s global development and marketing initiatives, including the expansion of its project pipeline.
“The need for utility-scale long-duration energy storage is clear,” said Charlie Gailliot, partner at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “Hydrostor’s A-CAES solution is well positioned to become a leading player in this emerging global market.”
In June 2021, the California Energy Commission said that it would procure 1,000 MW of long-duration energy storage, with durations of eight hours or longer, to be activated during the 2026-28 period.
