The IASR is about developing a range of plausible futures for growth in Australia’s energy demand, and how each would be met, thereby helping investors and policymakers make informed decisions on investment in generation, storage and transmission.

This year’s IASR was developed over a 10-month period of intense collaboration and consultation with industry participants, state and federal governments and consumer representatives.
In response to stakeholder requests for greater transparency and accuracy, it includes two new sections: a Transmission Cost Report and a Transmission Cost Database which outlines costs and risks and is accompanied by a cost estimation tool.
AEMO also received overwhelming demand from stakeholders, that the scenarios “reflect the observed rapid decarbonisation of the energy sector and pathways to achieve net-zero emissions across the economy,” said Alex Wonhas, AEMO’s Chief System Design Officer.
The observed uptick in momentum of the energy transition has led AEMO to add two central scenarios, that replace the single Central Scenario of the 2020 IASR. 
The Steady Progress scenario maps out decarbonisation as driven by “existing government policy, corporate abatement goals and continued growth in PV uptake”, said Wonhas in a statement accompanying the report’s release.
The Net Zero scenario is based on accelerating technology-led emission abatement, driven by extensive research and development, and “progressive tightening” of emission targets by state and local governments and private enterprise to achieve net-zero by 2050.
Then there’s the new Hydrogen Superpower Scenario, which says Wonhas, emerged from the surge of government and business momentum to develop a renewable hydrogen export economy, and describes a power system needed to support that ambition.
Each of the five refined or new scenarios sees a steady increase in distributed solar PV installation across the National Electricity Market (NEM) to 2050, and indeed a significant increase over forecasts made in the 2020 IASR.

The energy consumer response to COVID-19 — the “pandemic has seen household consumers redirecting discretionary income into assets that reduce their exposure to energy costs” — is part of growing consumer uptake of solar whatever the prevailing motivation to curb emissions. 
Interestingly, the Hydrogen Superpower scenario shows the highest uptake in rooftop solar by households and businesses, with a forecast 50 GW installed by around 2035, and 80 GW by 2050, which in part may reflect a more enthusiastic, coordinated Zeitgeist under a scenario that strives to accelerate the postitive impacts of deploying renewables.
Even the relatively gloomy Slow Change scenario, which assumes a challenging economic environment in the wake of the COVID pandemic accompanied by greater risk of industrial load closures, sees consumers “proactively managing energy costs through continued investments in DER”, particularly PV. The 2021 IASR revises its 2035  forecast for DER under the Slow Change scenario up from 20 GW in 2020 to 35 GW; and by 2050 DER will have increased to around 47 GW (the 2020 IASR had it estimated at a mere 30 GW).
In the small-scale sector, AEMO also “assumes a rebound of energy consumption equal to 20% of the energy generated by the PV systems as lower future bills may change consumption behaviour or trigger investments in equipment that uses more electricity” (as opposed to, say, natural gas), says the report.
With solar PV and wind generation continuing to provide the lowest cost generation of renewable energy, these energy sources feature in the High Variable Renewable Energy scenarios, Step Change and Hydrogen Superpower.
Step Change, however, is characterised as a “consumer-led change with focus on energy efficiency, DER, digitalisation and step increases in global emissions policy ambition”.         
Relative to the Net Zero 2050 scenario, Step Change is driven by faster decarbonisation ambitions to achieve control of climate temperature increase; and supported by “rapidly falling costs for battery storage and VRE, which drive consumers’ actions and higher levels of electrification of other sectors”, says the report.
It adds, that “changes in building design, smart appliances, and digitalisation” will help consumers manage their energy use.
This scenario also assumes a limited amount of hydrogen production connected to the NEM, and that Australia’s hydrogen ambitions are likely realised off grid, without impacting investment in or operation of the NEM.
Under the Hydrogen Superpower scenario, however, “Both domestic and export hydrogen demand are fuelled, at least in part, by NEM-connected electrolysis powered by additional VRE development,” envisages the IASR.
These capabilities will be driven by strong global impetus to tackle climate change and reduce emissions. AEMO posits that in this scenario, “as part of commensurate global action, Australia targets net zero emissions before 2050”.
An immense amount of considered research and data analysis is contained within the IASR, encompassing all aspects of integrated energy supply and demand, from the predicted charging behaviour around increasing numbers of battery electric vehicles under each scenario; to comparative locational costs envisaged for developing new generation; and the contribution and limits of generation within renewable energy zones (REZs).
The IASR’s 2021 iteration will inform AEMO’s 2021 Electricity Statement of Opportunities published later this year, its 2022 Gas Statement of Opportunities, scheduled for March, and AEMO’s updated 20-year outlook for the NEM — the 2022 Integrated System Plan, to be published mid next year.

Mapping out scenarios, explains this IASR, “is an effective practice to manage investment and business risks when planning in highly uncertain environments, particularly through disruptive transitions”.
The future for solar PV looks bright under every scenario, however, the contribution that solar-rich Australia can make towards abating emissions and climate change, as opposed to simply reducing energy costs of local consumers varies vastly.
For the layperson, for governments, investors and industry, clearly articulated scenarios also clarify the characteristics of what to avoid at all costs, and what to shoot for.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/02/half-of-my-new-sales-are-either-replacements-or-additional-systems/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",,"AUGUST 2, 2021",Half of my new sales are either replacements or additional systems,"When you’re just starting out, you’re a bit like most of the first-time customers out there right now. You think ‘with a 25 year panel performance warranty, what can go wrong?!’
Then, next minute, you start competing with 90% of solar companies in town. The problem is over half of that lot won’t be anywhere to be seen in five years time. Where’s Euro Solar today? What about True Value Solar? So many of the big players from just a few years ago are today gone. Like them, I was offering 25 year warranties on cheap panels, the difference is I’m still here, sticking around. I’ve stopped now and have set our standards higher.
If you want cheap solar panels, go for your life – I just have little interest in installing them for you, because who has to fix them when they give up the ghost? Not you, me! So how about I catch you on the flip side, in a few years time when you learn the lesson I did. That is – just do it properly the first time.
I confirmed with Tarryn Coetzee from Formbay, a trading platform that deals with the solar rebates, earlier this week – numbers have indeed increased in the last 12 months with rebates being awarded for ‘replacement solar systems.’
Tarryn actually told me that a lot of interest has come from solar installers who were confused if existing homeowners could still claim Small-scale Technology Certificates (STCs) for new panels if they’d had a solar system installed previously. The answer is yes, they just need to purchase a new solar inverter at the same time. The solar industry here moves so quick that those out of the loop could be forgiven for not knowing.
My company, Queensland Solar & Lighting, is now getting around 50% of all of its work from customers needing replacement solar inverters and businesses that need to upgrade their commercial solar systems because water is getting into the panels, as well as old wiring and isolator faults.
Julian, an electrician friend of mine, has a successful small solar repairs business in Brisbane called Brisbane Solar Repairs. He is flat-out fielding calls from disgruntled solar customers who have been left with orphaned systems and no one around to assist with warranties. They know their solar retailer has done the Harold Holt, but they’re annoyed to learn their solar panel or inverter manufacturer are no longer in Australia either. Again, where are the big players from just a few years ago at today? CSUN, Akcome, BYD, Samil, ZeverSolar – haven’t seen them on a wholesale price list in years. Incredible stuff, really!
I made the decision to focus more on selling quality solar components this time last year when I saw the demand for replacement solar systems ramp up. Hyundai, German-made SolarWatt panels, and LG solar panels are Queensland Solar & Lighting’s three main offerings today.
I feel so much better knowing that for the last 12 months I have primarily installed high quality solar panels from well-known brands. The customers have been great too. A few older customers and scenarios have seen me install a handful of Longi panel systems, panels I have on my own roof, but I pick my mark. I just want to have confidence in what I sell today, and I do.
So much so that I’ve made up a little flow-chart as a joke to show customers that we are now committed to quality and we are more than happy to walk away from the cheap solar work as it could likely lead to problems in the near future.

We still sell cheaper inverters, but good, reputable longstanding brands that have been in Australia for over 10 years now like Growatt and Sungrow. The reliability of solar inverters has improved immensely in the last five years. Failures are few and far between these days, and if there is a problem, it’s an easy swap. On the other hand, it appears the panel quality has gone the other way. Maybe I’m overreacting, but I’m much happier and more comfortable not offering the cheaper systems anymore.
Time will tell, but the data doesn’t look good.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/02/sodium-ion-batteries-a-commercial-reality-claims-catl/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",MARIAN WILLUHN,"AUGUST 2, 2021","Sodium-ion batteries a commercial reality, claims CATL","From pv magazine Global
Battery storage is an enabler of the energy transition, especially powerful lithium-ion devices. The devices have their drawbacks, though, as mining practices and the cost of lithium have raised concerns.
Robin Zeng, chairman of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL), a battery manufacturing heavyweight, has presented a solution. The company is commercially launching lithium-free sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries.
The manufacturer says its newest product ticks all the boxes for modern customer requirements. For starters, the battery reportedly shows a high energy density, of 160 Wh/kg. That is a little short of the 200 Wh/kg achieved by the LFP devices CATL ships for Tesla, but Zeng has already suggested the second generation of Na-ion batteries will reach the 200 Wh/kg mark. Modern NMC-811 devices show energy densities more in the region of 300 Wh/kg. 
However, the sodium-ion product is apparently not lagging in its other electrochemical properties, and can reportedly charge to 80% in just 15 minutes, for example. On top of that, comes the fact the battery is said to be working well in low temperatures. At -20 degrees Celsius, the Na-ion device retains 90% of its nameplate capacity, according to its manufacturer. Also, in terms of thermal stability, Chinese company CATL says its new product exceeds national standards.
CATL will use the first generation of the batteries to address the electric vehicle (EV) market and has highlighted key features such as its low-temperature performance, which would render it suitable for automotive markets with severe winters. CATL will initially roll out battery packs for EVs that combine sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries, to compensate for the shortage of energy density. To achieve this, CATL has also developed a battery management system. 
“The lower energy of the sodium-ion cells suggests that the technology may be more suited for stationary energy storage applications, which are less restrictive, while the unveiling of battery packs combining both sodium-ion and lithium-ion cells could point towards compromise in performance for low-cost electric vehicles, with the potential to disrupt the mass market,” said Wood Mackenzie research analyst Max Reid. 
Sodium-ion batteries have a similar working principle to lithium-ion devices. In both, the ion travels between anode and cathode, dropping or absorbing electrons. Though lithium is very good at this, it is also scarce as a raw material, with most of its production concentrated in Chile, Australia, and China. 
Not only is the lithium market volatile, due to geographical concentration of the metal, but its extraction is also under fire for its intensive water use and other aspects of its environmental footprint. Sodium-ion batteries have been suggested as a lithium-free alternative.
As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we have focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. Read about lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling, and contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
Wood Mackenzie sees the arrival of sodium-ion devices as offering the potential to relax supply constraints in battery raw materials. “About 93% of CATL’s cell capacity is located in China,” said senior analyst Le Xu. “Developing sodium-ion battery technology could diversify their raw materials consumption, especially [of] lithium. Battery suppliers such as CATL, Tesla, [and] LG Chem have proactively signed supply agreements with miners in Australia and Chile which pushed lithium chemicals spot prices to a new high in the past six months.”
Sodium is one of the most abundantly available elements in the earth’s crust and can be mined by performing electrolysis on sodium-chloride (table salt), for example. It can also be found in other chemical connections. 
The challenge with sodium-ion batteries, has been the larger volume of sodium ions required, compared to lithium ions. To accommodate the extra ions, particular requirements regarding the material’s structural stability and kinetic properties have to be considered and attempts to date have resulted in capacity fading rapidly in Na-ion devices. 
To meet the challenge, CATL said it used Prussian white material with a higher specific capacity. The material NaxFe[Fe(CN)6]y·nH2O has been considered a potential cathode candidate for Na-ion batteries by other research teams, too, but practical limitations relating to capacity and cycling stability had inhibited a commercial breakthrough. CATL said it has solved the problem by redesigning the bulk structure of the material and rearranging the electrons. On the anode side, CATL has also developed a novel carbon-based material, the highly porous structure of which enables the storage of sodium ions, ensuring cycle performance. 
“Sodium-ion technology has long been touted for commercial battery use due to sodium’s low cost and high abundance, relative to lithium, and CATL producing large scale sodium-ion batteries shows the technology’s appeal is coming to fruition sooner rather than later,” said WoodMac’s Reid. 
With an eye on production costs, Qisen Huang, deputy dean of the CATL Research Institute, said sodium-ion battery manufacturing would be highly compatible with currently-used production methods and equipment. CATL has started industrial production of the devices and wants to stabilise the industrial chain for such products by 2023. Doing so will require a joint effort by upstream suppliers and downstream consumers, CATL noted, and it has invited the two groups, and research institutes, to join forces to drive deployment of the product.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/02/how-origin-can-pull-the-plug-on-gas-and-top-australias-clean-energy-leader-board/,"HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"AUGUST 2, 2021",How Origin can pull the plug on gas and top Australia’s clean-energy leader board!,"Credible plans for Australia’s decarbonisation are constantly released into the wild, offering encouragement at the very least, that if the Government were to take responsibility and set a path for the country’s low-carbon future, there’s plenty of science and economics to back such decision making.
This morning brought an interesting twist, when energy market analyst ITK Services brought market intel, Government bullishness on gas, and economics, to bear on a plan for Origin Energy to emerge from its fossil-fueled malaise as a powerful player in renewable-energy retail and export.
On Friday, Origin wrote down the value of its business by $1.5 billion, as the costs of gas and coal generation continues to be undermined by the participation of increasing levels of low-cost renewable energy in Australia’s grid. 
The company also issued notice of a further $669 million one-off loss in the form of deferred tax liability by its Asia Pacific LNG (APLNG) operations — a joint venture with ConocoPhillips and Sinopec.
ITK was poised to take up the challenge of transformation with its report, Origin Energy: Time to leave its origins behind, which was commissioned by the influential Lock the Gate Alliance, a grassroots organisation championing regional ambitions to take control over inappropriate mining and gas exploration and instead promote sustainable solutions to food and energy production.
The plan, for a turnaround of Origin’s business, made by ITK principal, David Leitch — who may be the first to fashion a silk purse out of Scott Morrison’s sow’s ear of stubborn adherence to gas development in Australia — is that Origin should sell its share (37.5%, worth an estimated $8 billion) of APLNG while Government hyping of gas is running hot and demand for the product is still high. 
It would then channel those funds into a massive solar and wind portfolio to give climate-savvy energy retail customers what they want, as well as fuelling expanded hydrogen export ambitions — which are, incidentally, also currently supported by the Federal ruling coalition.
“Origin’s electricity business has been a long-term poor performer,” says Leitch in a statement accompanying his report, because he says, the company “doesn’t stand for anything.
“Its mixed portfolio of gas and oil exploration, together with electricity,” posits Leitch, “has not been valued by investors, leading to long-term share price underperformance.”
Origin CEO, Frank Calabria, conceded on Friday that impacts of lower wholesale electricity prices, combined with higher commodity prices for the coal and gas needed to fire its power stations were likely to take an ongoing toll on the company well into 2022.
But he added that these losses are expected to be “largely offset” by higher earnings from Origin’s LNG assets as post-pandemic economies rebound, again driving up oil and gas prices — a benefit, he said, of the company’s “diversified business”.
Leitch, on the other hand, says two of Origin Energy’s main assets, APLNG and Eraring power station, have relatively short life spans — of 17 and 10 years, respectively — and the company needs to “replace the operating profits those assets supply”.
Instead of applying the old salve of savings in capital and operating costs to its wounds, as proposed by Calabria, ITK proposes that Origin could “invest in a brand that actually means something to consumers, to become the first large-scale gentailer to offer a genuinely differentiated product”.
Eraring, argues Leitch, will soon incur substantial decommissioning and clean-up costs; the market for gas, which contributed 44% of the growth in annual global carbon emissions between 2010 and 2019 will soon suffer retribution at the hands of decarbonising states.
In addition, the cost of potential gas extracted from Origin’s multi-year Betaloo Basin project is likely to be prohibitive. Leitch predicts “zero-to-negative demand growth”, even if the product is found to be viable.
In contrast, he says, “there likely is a large market for a pure green electricity retailer”; and Origin is already an investor in such a proven brand, with a 20% stake in Octopus Energy.
Furthermore, says Leitch, “Green hydrogen and/or ammonia offers a path to the future.” After divesting itself of both APLNG and whatever promise lies in Beetaloo, Origin could develop a “real winner” renewable-energy retail business; and translate its successful management of APLNG’s upstream gas extraction into an export-focused hydrogen/ammonia business, shipping clean energy to Japan and South Korea.
Although Origin does have hydrogen projects on the boil, Leitch argues it will need the capital from gas asset sales to fund bolder investments in as yet unavailable large-scale electrolysers and hydrogen production on a scale that would give Origin the edge over would-be competitors.
These are not easy choices, but Leitch says that the gas-promoting Federal environment, supported by both the Liberal Coalition and the Labor Party, “provides a window for ORG [its stock-market handle] to exit its increasingly mature, but cash-flow generative gas assets and redeploy the funds into the seemingly cutthroat, profitless electricity market”.
And although hydrogen generation also faces numerous hurdles, Australia has natural advantages in the emerging market: principally the highest producing and therefore lowest cost solar-and-wind starter packs, and “plentiful Government support”. This plays perfectly, he says, to the global sense of urgency to develop hydrogen at scale. 
Is ITK Services’ report a metaphorical solution for the larger Australian energy malaise: be bold, be a leader, stand for something, look to the future, stand with the people’s needs and aspirations? 
Experience has shown that commercial organisations can frequently provide the example that government needs to envisage viable, sustainable business plans. See the rolling wave of companies signing up to the RE100 initiative as an example.
Ethinvest, a financial practice which supports activism that brings shareholder sustainability concerns to bear on companies, and an investor in Origin Energy, responded to an advance copy of the Lock The Gate-commissioned ITK report:
Its Managing Director, Trevor Thomas, said, “Origin Energy faces an existential crisis in a decarbonising world.
“This timely report outlines a pathway for shareholders to regain value from a company that has been a persistently disappointing investment.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/02/fire-at-victorian-big-battery-now-under-control/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"AUGUST 2, 2021",Fire at Victorian Big Battery now under control,"On Friday, two days after Neoen posted the Tweet below, a Tesla Megapack caught fire at the site of the Victorian Big Battery during testing of the Neoen-developed 300 MW/450 MWh project, which is due for completion this year.

Fire and Rescue Victoria led the response to the blaze, which is believed to have originated in one Megapack module and to have affected another on the site.
More than 30 fire trucks and support vehicles responded to the incident, which was contained by firefighters wearing breathing apparatus, before it could spread to others of the 210 battery-energy storage modules on site in Moorabool in the City of Greater Geelong.
A scientific officer monitored air quality with the assistance of drones, and although a Watch & Act Warning was issued after midday, for toxic smoke at Batesford, Bell Post Hill, Lovely Banks and Moorabool residents, Victoria’s Environment Protection Authority found that air quality in the local area remained good.
Neoen Australia’s Managing Director, Louis de Sambucy said in a statement on Friday afternoon that, “No one was injured and the site has been evacuated. Neoen and Tesla are working closely with emergency services on site to manage the situation”.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) confirmed that the battery had been separated from the grid and the fire had not affected operation of electricity services.
The Country Fire Association (CFA) remained on site with FRV after the incident and continued to “monitor the temperature decline of the two affected battery packs”.
An update from the CFA yesterday afternoon (Sunday 1 August), reported, “The fire has subsided significantly. Crews are now doing atmospheric monitoring around the cabinet and will check to see how active the fire is internally behind each of the doors.”
The incident will rekindle concerns that lithium-ion batteries are prone to catching fire, but the cause of the fire is as yet unknown and all parties to the development of the battery facility will be engaged in determining its origins and subsequent appropriate action.
The Victorian Big Battery is set to become one of the largest such storage facilities in the world, and the biggest to be completed so far in Australia. 
It will provide a critical boost to the security of Victoria’s energy supply while supporting greater penetration of renewables into the grid.
In November, AEMO awarded the battery a 10-year contract under the System Integrity Protection Scheme, which will require the operators to reserve 250 MW of its capacity to participate in increasing the capability of the Victoria-to-New South Wales Interconnector (VNI) and respond to unexpected network outages.
And in February this year, developer Neoen reached financial close on the battery after the Australian Government’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) provided a $160 million debt facility to finance design, construction and operation of the project.
Tesla’s Megapack technology is also being deployed in Transgrid’s $61.9 million 50 MW/75MWh, Wallgrove Grid Battery in Western Sydney, and in a number of smaller projects.
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency has contributed $11.5 million in funding for Wallgrove which should reach completion this year, and which is intended to provide technical experience of how often the battery is needed to contribute fast frequency response to the NSW network, and how much electricity it is able to store and dispatch under various conditions.
Batteries have emerged as a more cost-effective alternative to controlling frequency than other technologies such as synchronous condensers, and are expected to thereby reduce the ultimate cost of electricity to consumers.
Australia’s power systems currently rely on inertia provided by the large turbines at the heart of coal, gas and hydro generators to maintain a consistent frequency and help the system ride out any disturbances. As more sources of wind and solar generation are connected to the grid and coal-fired generators are retired, alternative sources of inertia will be needed to stabilise the network.
ARENA CEO Darren Miller, has said that “Large-scale batteries have a big role to play in firming and balancing our electricity system as we move towards a future energy mix.”
Tesla announced the arrival of its Megapack product in July 2019, as a rapid-deployment, large-scale energy-storage solution.
Supplied fully assembled, Megapack’s modular construction enables the company to install “an emissions free, 250 MW/1 GWh power plant in less than three months” or four times faster than a fossil fuel plant of the same size, the company said at the time.
The Megapack offers a 60% increase in energy density over its Powerpack utility-scale storage systems which were famously installed at the then 100 MW/129 MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia in December 2017.
Following its hugely successful deployment, the Hornsdale Power Reserve was expanded to 150 MW/194 MWh in September 2020.
De Sambucy has said, “We will provide updates and further details,” of the fire and its cause, “as they become available.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/02/first-solar-plans-a-3-3-gw-indian-module-fab/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"AUGUST 2, 2021",First Solar plans a 3.3 GW Indian module fab,"From pv magazine USA
First Solar said it plans to invest $684 million in a new, fully vertically integrated photovoltaic thin film solar module manufacturing facility in India. Contingent upon permitting, and pending approval of Indian government incentives that are satisfactory to the Arizona-based First Solar, the facility is expected to be built in the state of Tamil Nadu and commence operations in the second half of 2023.
The planned facility is projected to have a nameplate capacity of 3.3 GWdc.
First Solar produces its thin film PV modules using a fully integrated, continuous process under one roof and uses a cadmium telluride (CdTe) semiconductor.
In early June, First Solar said it would invest $680 million to expand its domestic U.S. photovoltaic solar manufacturing capacity by 3.3 GW annually, representing an implied capital expenditure of around $0.20 per watt. The company said it intended to fund construction of its third U.S. manufacturing facility in Ohio with existing cash resources.
All totalled, the company said that its nameplate manufacturing capacity will double to 16 GWdc in 2024.
Circular manufacturing has been the focus of one of the UP Initiative’s quarterly themes. We looked at whether adopting circular approaches can create a competitive edge and reap financial and reputational rewards, in addition to investigating what is already being done in the solar industry. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
In a statement, Mark Widmar, CEO, said that India offers an attractive market for First Solar in part because the company’s module technology is advantaged in a hot, humid climate. He said the country has “a well-defined goal that will need over 25 GW of solar to be deployed every year for the next nine years.”
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has projected that India will overtake the European Union (EU) to become the world’s third-largest consumer of electricity by 2030, as the country’s population and gross domestic product (GDP) continue to grow. As part of its climate targets, India has committed to ensuring that renewables will make up 40% of its energy portfolio by 2030. The country is forecast to account for almost 20% of the world’s installed solar capacity by 2040.
The facility will be designed using the manufacturing template established for First Solar’s recently-announced factory in Ohio. Combining highly skilled workers with ‘industry 4.0’ architecture, machine-to-machine communication, artificial intelligence, and internet of things connectivity, it will feature high degrees of automation, precision, and continuous improvement.
The company said it continues to optimise the amount of semiconductor material used, by enhancing its vapour deposition process. First Solar also operates a recycling program that recovers more than 90% of CdTe for use in new modules.
