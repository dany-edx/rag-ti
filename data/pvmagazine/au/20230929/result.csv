The battery, that will have up to 500 MW of capacity and a duration of up to four hours of dispatchable energy, is to be located adjacent to EnergyAustralia’s 1.4 GW coal-fired Mt Piper power station that is set to close in 2040 at the latest.
EnergyAustralia said the battery, first announced late last year, will utilise the existing electricity and transmission infrastructure and will help to improve diversity and reliability of the electricity network as coal generation retires and more renewables enter the system.
“Energy storage projects, such as this one, are an important part of the national transition to a more secure and reliable energy future,” the company said.
“It will store excess energy generated by renewables and release it to customers when needed, providing critical firming support to the NSW energy market.”

While the Mt Piper project is in the early stages of assessment and planning, EnergyAustralia, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hong Kong-based energy company CLP Group, has previously said if approved, the battery could be operational by the end of 2026.
If the Mt Piper battery project proceeds it will be the second EnergyAustralia-owned battery energy storage system under development.
EnergyAustralia has committed to building a four-hour utility-scale battery of 350 MW capacity on the site of its gas-fired Jeeralang power station at Hazelwood North in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley.
The Wooreen Energy Storage System is scheduled to be commissioned by the end of 2026, ahead of Yallourn’s planned closure in mid-2028.

To complement the government-backed support, the company and its debt advisor KPMG Corporate Finance have now also progressed talks with international and domestic commercial banks.
While details of the talks remain confidential, QPM confirmed it has already received non-binding short-form indicative term sheets from seven commercial banks.
QPM Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Stephen Grocott said the commitments are well in excess of the company’s required target.
“We are delighted at the response received to date from commercial financiers and their willingness to consider debt funding for the TECH project,” he said.
“Our strategy has been to initially target government-backed lending agencies and then to refine the funding structure through support from the commercial banks. This approach has borne fruit. We look forward to advancing through the due diligence phase and to credit approvals.”
The TECH project, being developed in the Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct about 40 kilometres south of Townsville, would refine approximately 1.6 million tonnes of ore annually to produce critical materials for use in new-technology batteries.
It will process high-grade laterite ore imported from New Caledonia to yield nickel sulfate and cobalt sulphate, along with other valuable by-products.
QPM has offtake agreements in place to sell product to Korean companies LG Energy Solutions, the world’s largest battery manufacturer, and POSCO.
Automotive giant General Motors has also inked a deal to purchase nickel and cobalt sulphate produced at the facility.
Approximately 800 construction jobs as well as an estimated 1,700 operational jobs are set to be created by the TECH project.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/29/central-west-orana-rez-reaches-transmission-infrastructure-milestone/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2023",Central-West Orana REZ reaches transmission infrastructure milestone,"An environmental impact statement (EIS) for the transmission infrastructure that will connect the proposed Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) to the electricity grid in New South Wales (NSW) has been lodged with the state’s Department of Planning and Environment.
The initial stage of the Central-West Orana REZ, which encompasses approximately 20,000 square kilometres centred around the towns of Dubbo, Dunedoo and Mudgee, is to deliver at least 3 GW of new network capacity to replace coal-fired power generation.
The REZ will be serviced by new transmission network infrastructure, including high-capacity transmission lines and energy hubs. The project calls for the development of new twin double circuit 500 kV transmission lines between Wollar and the proposed substations at Merotherie and Elong Elong, and connections from these lines to new large-scale solar, wind and energy storage projects in the REZ.
The transmission infrastructure EIS, which will remain open for public feedback until 26 October 2023, provides detail about the transmission project, including an assessment of environmental, social, and economic matters and measures to mitigate and avoid potential impacts.
EnergyCo, which is leading the development of the REZ transmission network infrastructure in its capacity as the infrastructure planner for the renewable energy zones in NSW, said the new infrastructure will be critical for the successful operation of the Central-West Orana REZ.
EnergyCo said it will host a series of information sessions in the coming weeks to support the release of the EIS.
NSW Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said the lodgement of the EIS demonstrates the government’s commitment to delivering on the state’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap and ensuring new generation is up and running before old coal-fired power plants close.
Released in 2020, the 20-year roadmap calls for at least 12 GW of renewable energy backed up by 2 GW of storage by 2030, helping replace capacity lost with the shutdown of coal power generators including AGL Energy’s Liddell, and Origin Energy’s Eraring.
“The Central West Orana transmission project will be capable of connecting at least 3 GW of renewable energy generated by wind and solar projects, which is enough to power a quarter of the state’s energy demand, as well as another 2 GW of firming storage,” Sharpe said.
The Central-West Orana REZ is the first of five designated clean energy zones detailed in the NSW Government’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap. REZs will also be developed in the New England, Hunter-Central Coast, South-West and Illawarra regions.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/29/origin-lands-45-million-to-progress-hunter-valley-hydrogen-hub/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2023",Origin lands $45 million to progress Hunter Valley hydrogen hub," 
The New South Wales (NSW) government has signed off on a $45 million funding agreement to help build the Hunter Valley Hydrogen Hub and assist emissions-heavy industries in reducing their reliance on fossil fuels.
The Hunter Valley Hydrogen Hub project, led by Origin Energy, will deliver approximately 55 MW of electrolyser capacity by 2026, with a goal of scaling to more than 1 GW capacity over the next decade. The electrolyser will be connected to the grid and renewable energy certificates will be surrendered so the electricity can qualify as “green”.
It is expected the first stage of the project will be capable of producing up to 5,500 tonnes of green hydrogen each year with most of the output to be used by explosives manufacturer Orica’s ammonia manufacturing facility on Kooragang Island. Hydrogen will also be made available for refuelling hydrogen buses and trucks at the hub.
Origin Future Fuels General Manager Ryan Willemsen-Bell said hydrogen has the potential help Australia reach its decarbonisation goals through substitution into industrial processes and manufacturing and by replacing diesel in heavy transport.
He did however say that government funding is crucial to the development of the technology.
“Support from government is vital to bridging the commerciality gap that exists for hydrogen projects today, helping to demonstrate the technology can be produced at scale,” he said.
The NSW government funding announcement follows a $70 million contribution from the federal government announced in mid-July.
Origin said that pending a final investment decision, construction of the Hunter Valley Hydrogen Hub is expected to begin in 2025 with first hydrogen production targeted from 2026.
NSW Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said the project will serve as a regional cornerstone of the hydrogen industry, accelerating the state’s shift towards clean technologies and net zero.
“The Hunter area is one of NSW’s leading industrial regions … and has a critical role to play in our state’s clean energy transition,” she said.
“Projects like the Hunter Valley Hydrogen Hub are vital to decarbonising the industrial sector as we work towards a net-zero future.”
Sharpe said a green hydrogen industry in NSW has the potential to support 10,000 new jobs and add $6.4 billion in gross state product.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/29/solar-industry-should-focus-on-virtual-power-plants-says-us-official/,"MARKETS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2023","Solar industry should focus on virtual power plants, says US official","From pv magazine USA
The days of the solar industry operating as a “net metering type of industry” are “starting to be numbered,” said Jigar Shah, the director of the US Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office, at the recent RE+ 2023 conference in Las Vegas.
“Most solar systems come with batteries, and most are integrating smart panels,” he said. “They’re integrating demand response and load control capabilities into the inverter controls.”
Because a solar-plus-storage system with those features can earn its owner compensation through participation in a virtual power plant (VPP) – an aggregation of similar systems often managed by a third-party aggregator – Shah encouraged the solar industry to see its future in VPPs. The deployment of VPPs to date is shown in the featured image above.
Besides distributed storage, other distributed energy resources that can be aggregated into a VPP include electric vehicle chargers, smart thermostats, and smart electric water heaters.
Shah said that electric utilities are “looking to bury the hatchet and really deploy a lot of these technologies at scale” through VPPs. “Frankly, it is the only way for them to integrate all of the huge load that is coming their way.”
Shah said utilities Duke Energy, serving the Carolinas, and Luma Energy in Puerto Rico have announced large VPP projects, the latter with the residential solar firm Sunnova.
Addressing the solar industry professionals in his audience at RE+, Shah said “you’re the ones who should be integrating all of the technologies that are shown on the floor out there, into a coherent package.”
For its part, the DoE anticipates lending support on the order of $100 million to advance VPPs, Shah said. Sunnova’s inclusion of low- and moderate-income Puerto Ricans in its VPP project is being supported by $3 million in loan support, while other applicants are already preparing $30 million in loan requests.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/29/low-temperature-processes-to-reduce-silver-use-in-tandem-perovskite-silicon-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,WORLD",VALERIE THOMPSON,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2023",Low-temperature processes to reduce silver use in tandem perovskite-silicon solar cells,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) have developed new low temperature manufacturing processes for perovskite silicon tandem cells and heterojunction solar cells. The novel techniques are reportedly able to reduce silver consumption and avoid lead-containing soldering materials.
“We show that with a deep understanding of the processes and material behaviour, low-temperature metallisation and interconnection with the established equipment of solar cell and module production lines is possible,” the research’s lead author, Angela De Rose, told pv magazine.
The scientists developed two different processes: front-side metallisation at very low temperatures for full-size perovskite silicon tandem solar cells; and the interconnection to high-efficiency full-format demonstrator modules with an output power of more than 400 W.
The metallisation step used fine-line screen printing. The selected paste was shown to be suitable for high-speed printing reliable at widths of 20 μm, resulting in a printed width of 26 μm. The process translated into 43% less silver consumption compared to a layout with finger widths of 35 μm. For curing at 150 C, “good electrical properties were reached” and high throughput production is possible due to fast curing times down to 2 minutes per wafer, according to the researchers.
For interconnection, the group used electrically conductive adhesives (ECA), screening several pastes and methods. “There are many commercially available ECAs on the market, allowing the processing at different temperature ranges, including less than 200 C and less than 150 C,” it explained, noting that most of ECAs use silver particles to ensure more electrical conductivity.
Their techniques achieved silver reduction by using finer line printing and less ECA than conventional methods and avoiding lead-containing materials in the low temperature screenprinting pastes and lead-free solder alloys.
The researchers claim they have been able to use 50% less ECA compared to the conventional continuous application patterns, noting that the proposed solution offers sufficient joint adhesion for string handling and stable module powers on the cells, also for ECA curing temperatures of 130 C. “The major challenge for this approach is to keep the curing time as short as possible to enable high throughput,” they said.
The solar modules made with a soldered wire interconnection and ECA ribbon interconnection have a total area of 1.8 m2, an output of more than 400 W, consisting of full-size perovskite silicon tandem half cells. The solder-coated wire enabled low-temperature processing and damage-free fabrication, said the researchers.
“By optimising the involved processes and materials hand-in-hand, we were able to build highly efficient perovskite silicon heterojunction modules in full-format with different interconnection technologies,” said De Rose.
The team claimed the process enables high-throughput production at stringing speeds of 1600 to 1800 cells per hour. The cell matrix, either silicon heterojunction or tandem, was embedded into a commercially available encapsulant for a lamination process within a conventional process window between 140C and 160C. The full-size modules were built as glass-glass modules with edge sealing.
The processes were described in the study “Low-temperature metallization & interconnection for silicon heterojunction and perovskite silicon tandem solar cells,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.
The group’s future research activity includes lead-free and low-temperature soldering, shingling interconnection using ECA, as well as long-term stability of tandem cells and modules.
