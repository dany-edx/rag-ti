The WA energy sector has undergone unprecedented change in recent years with households embracing renewable energy technology at record rates with approximately 3,000 homes installing rooftop solar each month.
New figures released by the government show that in 2021, WA households added 191 MW of generation capacity to their rooftops, bringing the total amount of residential solar capacity in the state’s main grid to more than 1.35 GW.
That collective capacity means rooftop solar is the largest cumulative generator in the state, far outstripping the capacity of Synergy’s 854 MW coal-fired Muja Power Station.
More than 400,000 WA homes and businesses, about 36% of customers, now have rooftop solar connected to the South West Interconnected System (SWIS).
WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston said while the uptake of renewable technologies provides the opportunity for Western Australians to enjoy low cost and low emissions electricity, the intermittent and uncontrolled nature of these energy sources is presenting challenges to maintain the security, reliability and affordability of the power system.

“Over the past 10 years, rooftop solar has increased by over 600%, with 50% of Western Australian households expected to have solar panels by 2030,” he said.
“These rapid changes to the energy landscape have presented a range of challenges and opportunities, which we are addressing to ensure electricity remains affordable and reliable.”
Johnston said to enable the continued uptake of rooftop solar panels on homes and avoid blackouts, the government has introduced a range of policies, products and initiatives including the new Emergency Solar Management rules which come into effect on 14 February 2022.
The new rules will give network operators the capacity to remotely switch off residential solar systems as an emergency grid stability mechanism. The measures will apply to all new and upgraded solar PV and battery installations with an inverter capacity of 5kW or less.
The mechanism is to only be used as a “last resort” measure when demand for electricity reaches a critically low level and could affect the stability of the SWIS.
The state government said the changes will apply to those installing a new rooftop solar system 5 kW or less, and to those upgrading an existing rooftop solar system to 5 kW or under from 14 February 2022. They will also apply to those customers adding a battery, with the solar inverter remaining 5 kW or under.
A grace period has been provided for applications made prior to 14 February 2022 but installed by 14 March 2022.

The new requirements will only apply to new and upgraded rooftop solar, meaning existing customers will not be affected.
The WA state government said it is also working on a long-term plan to reduce the need for curtailment, including investment in battery energy storage, improving pricing signals, and allowing for customer devices to provide energy services for payment.
WA is the second state to give network operators the capacity to remotely switch off residential solar systems as an emergency grid stability mechanism. A similar mechanism was first introduced in South Australia (SA) in 2020.
SA network operators utilised the mechanism for the first time in March 2021, remotely switching off more than 10,000 rooftop solar systems and almost 30 MW of large-scale solar PV when the state experienced “near-record minimum demand levels for electricity from the grid.”
Johnston said he expects other states will soon introduce regulations which provide transmission authorities with the ability to restrict solar PV output.
“Anywhere like Queensland that has high levels of rooftop solar will almost certainly follow down this pathway,” he said.
“It’s a sensible solution to a new problem. It allows more solar panels to be installed, and it allows that to benefit the whole community.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/14/major-marine-survey-launched-for-proposed-3-5-billion-transmission-project/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,TASMANIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 14, 2022",Major marine survey launched for proposed $3.5 billion transmission project,"The Marinus Link company, a subsidiary of state-owned network operator TasNetworks, has launched a major marine engineering survey in a bid to identify the optimum route for the undersea cable which would connect Tasmania and Victoria, unlocking renewable energy projects on both sides of Bass Strait.
Marinus Link said the survey, the third for the project and the largest so far, will build on results and analysis of previous site investigations and help identify the most suitable corridor for burying the project’s undersea high voltage direct current (HVDC) cable.
Marinus Link chief executive Bess Clark said the survey work is “well underway, with feet on the ground and a ship being mobilised”.
“We’ve got teams working across Tasmania, Victoria and preparing for our next Bass Strait survey,” she said.
“They’re gathering data to support design and approvals work, to progress Marinus Link and help Australia’s transition to clean, reliable and affordable energy.”
Melbourne-based TEK Ocean Group, appointed to provide marine services by Australian company MMA Offshore which last year won the $5.5 million engineering surveys contract, said on Friday the 87-metre TEK Ocean Spirit had sailed from port in Burnie and headed south to start the survey.
The survey will encompass an estimated 255 kilometres between Heybridge in northwest Tasmania and Waratah Bay in South Gippsland, Victoria. Those on board the vessel will investigate approximately 110 sites across the Bass Strait, in sea depths up to 80 metres. The survey is expected to take between four to six weeks to complete.
Marinus Link offshore lead Sean Van Steel said the main aims of the site investigation are to assist with the cable route feasibility assessment and cost estimates for the project.
“This survey builds on the results and analysis of previous surveys we have conducted,” he said. “The locations chosen to take samples have been selected to minimise the impact on the seabed floor, reefs and marine life.”

Clark has previously said the proposed $3.5 billion project will “give Australians access to cheaper, clean, reliable energy and transform Tasmania into a renewable energy powerhouse”.
“With Project Marinus, businesses and investors in mainland Australia will have the assurance of a stable power supply when solar and wind generation is not available and batteries have run out,” she said.
“Along with other major transmission projects, Project Marinus will become the backbone of a reliable, lower emissions NEM for the next decade and beyond.”
The company said the link is expected to “unlock” carbon dioxide emission reductions of at least 140 million tonnes by 2050, the equivalent of removing about one million petrol or diesel cars from the road.
The current target date for commissioning and commercial operation of the first 750 MW stage of the Marinus Link project is 2027-28, with the commissioning and commercial operation of the second 750 MW stage currently scheduled for 2029-30.
The start of the survey follows the Tasmanian Government’s announcement that it has terminated its commercial agreement with the company that operates the Basslink undersea cable that currently links the island state’s grid to the mainland.

Tasmania Energy Minister Guy Barnett said in a statement on Thursday the government and state-owned utility Hydro Tasmania had taken “another step” towards protecting their legal rights, by terminating the Basslink Services Agreement (BSA).
The move is the latest in a long-running legal dispute between the government and the operators of the link following a months-long failure of the interconnector in 2015 which contributed to an energy crisis in the state. A 2020 arbitration concerning the cause of the outage found the link cannot meet the capacity requirements set out in the BSA.
The companies that own and operate the Basslink cable were ordered to pay more than $70 million to Hydro Tasmania and the state government but have since entered voluntary administration.
Barnett said since then the government and Hydro Tasmania have been in negotiations with Basslink’s receivers “regarding an alternative commercial arrangement”.
The termination of the BSA is not expected to impact Tasmania’s energy security with Barnett saying the interconnector will remain in service while negotiations continue.
Hydro Tasmania said it remains willing to discuss with receivers an alternative commercial model that could include key elements of the BSA, that would provide funding during the receivership and help transition the asset to an alternative commercial model.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/14/seasonal-frequency-in-the-nem-is-vre-continuing-to-drive-it/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"FEBRUARY 14, 2022",Seasonal frequency in the NEM: is VRE continuing to drive it?,"The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) reports that the national electricity market (NEM) frequency has improved significantly since implementing the first tranche of generator PFR settings. Frequency deviation has been much narrower, highlighting the benefit of tighter frequency response under normal conditions.
Having said that, in the face of rapid growth of variable renewable energy (VRE) and distributed rooftop solar, frequency control remains a challenge for AEMO, which is yet to be solved.
In this Chart of the Week, I examine how large-scale wind and solar technologies (excluding distributed rooftop solar – DPV) performed against (and impacted) the time-of-day frequency change during the summer and winter of 2021.
As shown in Figure 1 (Summer 2021), the number of frequency deviations that occurred outside the PFR band was largely concentrated around daytime hours (6am-6pm).
Figure 1 clearly shows that frequency tends to deviate less during the early morning hours and significantly more around 3pm, potentially resulting from higher DPV dispatch.

This trend may get more pronounced as more rooftop/grid solar connects, creating a steeper frequency rump in the afternoons. Figure 1 indicates that frequency deviation in summer is more correlated to renewable output. This might suggest that in summer, frequency is more impacted by VRE. In winter, we observe the opposite.
As seen in the Figure 2, the number of VRE dispatch intervals (> 40MW) is very similar to summer 2021, however frequency behaves differently. This may suggest that other generators (i.e., coal and gas) have greater impact on frequency during winter.
We have seen a higher number of frequency deviations in the winter than in summer, which supports our hypothesis that frequency is more impacted by coal and gas generators in winter.
Image: Cornwall
Can these trends suggest that frequency tend to deviate more during winter? To confirm this further, analysis of DPV, coal, gas, and generator outages needs to be completed.
It is left to be seen how the existing PFR requirements and their associated benefits will incentivise hybrid projects (with/without storage) to provide voluntary and mandatory provision of PFR to help stabilise frequency across the NEM.
In general, it is good news for battery developers and investors as they can have more flexibility when comparing different revenue streams (including potential PFR services) for battery storage assets.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/14/renewables-reach-new-highs-in-nem-as-fossil-fuels-slump-to-historic-lows/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 14, 2022",Renewables reach new highs in NEM as fossil fuels slump to historic lows,"New figures published by the Climate Council show that renewable energy generation in the National Electricity Market (NEM) increased by almost 20% in 2021, with renewables including large and small-scale solar PV supplying 31.4% of electricity generation last year while gas generators supplied just 5.7%.
The analysis, based on data from OpenNEM, shows renewable energy generation reached record highs in all mainland states in 2021, while Tasmania equalled its previous record with large and small-scale solar PV, wind, and hydro power producing 99.9% of the island state’s electricity needs.
The continued rise of renewables came as gas generation declined across the country to its lowest level in more than 15 years.
In New South Wales (NSW), gas provided just 1.5% of the state’s power while in South Australia (SA), gas generation fell to its lowest level in more than two decades.
Renewables provided SA with more than double the power generated from gas with renewables generating 66% of the state’s electricity while gas only accounted for 34%.
Climate Council senior researcher Tim Baxter said Victoria had experienced the biggest jump in renewable energy generation of anywhere in Australia in 2021, increasing 30% last year.
“On the flipside, gas provided less than 2% of the state’s power,” he said. “That’s a whopping 39% fall from the year before, and the biggest drop in gas use of any mainland state over the same 12-month period.”

In Western Australia, renewables outstripped gas to become the largest source of power in the state’s main energy grid.
Renewables provided 32% of the South West Interconnected System’s (SWIS) power in 2021, a rise of 26%, while gas provided 30%, its lowest level in more than a decade.
Rooftop solar continues to play an increasingly important role in Australia’s energy mix, not just directly powering individual homes but contributing 7.9% to NEM demand in 2021, up from 6.4% in 2020 and 5.2% in 2019.
The role of large-scale solar in the energy mix also continues to increase, contributing 4.3% to NEM demand in 2021, up from 3.3% on the previous year and almost double the 2.5% contribution in 2019.
Baxter said the figures make a mockery of the federal government’s continued advocacy for a ‘gas-led recovery’, including last week’s environmental tick of approval for the 660 MW gas-fired power plant at Kurri Kurri, in the NSW Hunter Valley.
The Morrison Government has committed $600 million in public funding to construct the project.

“When you look at the data and what renewables are doing for Australians’ hip pockets, the push for gas from the Morrison Government seems increasingly irresponsible and economically reckless,” Baxter said.
“Gas is expensive, polluting, and diminishing in importance and relevance as the rest of the world moves towards net zero, and our own states and territories rapidly roll-out large-scale renewable energy and storage.”
While gas generation continued to decline, so too did coal which provided just 62.7% of the NEM’s power, its lowest contribution since the formation of the NEM in 1998.
The analysis comes after a Climate Council poll of more than 2,000 voters in Queensland and NSW found that more than 60% of respondents believe the future prosperity of the states won’t be found in coal or gas, but rather in clean industries like green hydrogen, the mining of critical minerals like lithium and cobalt, and manufacturing renewable products.
The survey found only a quarter of voters in Queensland and about one fifth in NSW believe their state’s future prosperity lies in coal and gas.
The survey found that 60% of people in Queensland and 62% in NSW believe the government’s top investment priority should be in renewables.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/14/next-gen-concentrated-solar-power-now-under-development-in-us/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 14, 2022",Next-gen concentrated solar power now under development in US,"From pv magazine USA
Concentrated solar power (CSP) uses heliostat mirrors to direct sunlight into a collection tower, storing heat energy in abundant mediums like rocks, sand or molten salt for highly available energy dispatch. High-heat and available energy is a key element in many machine and industrial processes, so the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Department of Energy (DoE) are working on the next generation of CSP facilities.
The Gen3 CSP program targets an energy cost of US$0.05/kWh. The DoE has identified opportunities in three material pathways: storing heat in sand-like particles, in liquids like molten salt, and in gases, such as the technology developed by Brayton Energy. The DoE selected particle-based storage as the main method for its funding, but also opened the door for NREL to run a two-year liquid molten salt research program.
Challenges, breakthroughs
NREL’s Craig Turchi, a leader in thermal energy science and technology, said molten salts are a desirable option for heat transfer and storage as they are easy to work with and can be pumped through pipes and heat exchangers. However, there are some practical challenges, which Turchi’s team is currently working on overcoming.
Though molten salts are easy to move, they are also corrosive to their holding tanks and pipes. “We actually solved that problem by and large. NREL and partners did a lot of great science on the salt chemistry—how to purify it, how to make it relatively noncorrosive if you control the chemistry, and we demonstrated that in the lab,” said Turchi.
The next hurdle was finding the right kinds of salts for the Gen3 CSP liquid path. Commercial systems often use nitrate salts, but NREL said these begin to degrade at higher temperatures. NREL targets high temperatures for more efficient energy conversion, so it settled on chloride salts for their higher level of stability under extreme temperatures.
Another challenge is keeping the storage tank hot. The molten salts used freeze at 400 C, so extra insulation is needed. “Our design is a steel tank, but whereas the current tanks are insulated on the outside, our proposed tank was insulated on the inside to protect the steel,” said Turchi. The DoE awarded NREL US$2 million to build a prototype tank, which is being built on NREL’s campus in Golden, Colorado.
Kerry Rippy, an NREL expert in inorganic chemistry, and her team explored electrochemical methods to further remove corrosive impurities in molten chloride salt. She is also developing electrochemical sensors to be placed inside storage tanks to monitor the purity of the salts during experimentation.
“There are multiple potential avenues for this research to be valuable. It can be beneficial for solar fuel synthesis; it could enable high-temperature fuel cells, and the nuclear industry is also really interested in this research,” said Rippy.
Solar PV and energy storage are excellent in providing reliable electricity, but some industrial processes require high-heat or large amounts of available energy. This has led to developments in CSP, and in other technologies, which are already being met with commercial success.
Recently, startup company Rondo Energy closed a US$22 million Series A funding round to scale its renewable energy heat batteries. The membrane-based battery stores solar and wind energy in solids at temperatures over 1,200 C. The company said it plans to begin manufacturing and delivering systems to customers later this year.
In November, Heliogen partnered with Bloom Energy to create green hydrogen fuel. Heliogen’s CSP creates heat, steam, and electricity from concentrated sunlight. It was paired with Bloom’s solid-oxide, high-temperature electrolyser to make the fuel. The company said hydrogen can be made 45% more efficiently than low-temperature PEM and alkaline electrolysers. Electricity dictates nearly 80% of the cost of hydrogen from electrolysis. The CSP method reduces the need for electricity, using heat to aid its operations.
