Neoen CEO Xavier Barbaro explained on a recent investor call that the delay is the result of issues during the connection compliance testing.
“The Capital battery commissioning is now expected in 2024,” Barbaro said. “The connection compliance tests under the direct responsibility of the EPC contractor are taking much more time than initially expected.”
Doosan GridTech, the energy storage subsidiary of South Korea’s Doosan Heavy Industries and Construction, is the project’s EPC.
Precisely what is causing these delays is unknown, with possibilities spanning from resource shortages, equipment malfunctions, installation errors, and the need for “harmonic filters.”
Barbaro said the company had accounted for potential damages from delays in its initial EPC contract. “It is not especially making us nervous, we do have some comfort in the level of  liquidity damages we have in place because that is in the price that we pay for the EPC contract,” he said.
He added that calculating potential revenue loss is tricky, however, because of the uncertain nature of battery revenues. “Maybe we are going to get less than what we could have made in the market, maybe in the end we are going to get more. On average we plan to get something that is good enough to offset the effect of the delays we are incurring,” he said.
Construction on the Capital battery begun back in December 2021, with the project initially expected to enter operations in early 2023. The battery sits about 10km southeast of the Australian capital, Canberra, beside TransGrid’s Queanbeyan substation.

The Council’s waste coordinator, Evan Brooks, said he was approached by Repurposing for Resilience, a local volunteer group made up of electricians, engineers and fabricators, to intercept used solar panels so the group can locally repurpose them.
“We process and test equipment to make it available to our community either through gifting it to households in need or making it more affordable through resale,” RfR coordinator Lisa Cornthwaite said.
“We’re seeing so many households that are replacing solar panels that still have years left in their lifecycle,” she added. “By returning it to its use stream with warranty we are instilling confidence in a second-hand market.”
Cornthwaite said solar panels no longer fit for their intended use will be repurposed or upcycled into things like USB charging tables, building cladding, outdoor furniture, dog kennels and garden beds.
“We want to make a positive impact, making sure solar panels and components get the most of their working life, before they’re broken down for recycled materials,” Cornthwaite added.
Solar recycling is something of an ambivalent industry in Australia, and also worldwide. There are numerous solar panel recycling schemes and companies, but very few which are actually processing – that is, actually recycling – solar panels. 
Reusing solar equipment has less environmental impact because it involves less processing, but this too has come under fire with many companies simply making a business of exporting secondhand panels to Africa, especially Nigeria, without any due testing process or regulatory overview.
The Eurobodalla program says it is only looking to reuse panels locally. The Council has now initiated a free drop-off point at Moruya Transfer station, though a $10 fee still applies at the Surf Beach and Brou facilities, it said.

The company nonetheless expects the battery to complete commissioning and commence operations by mid-November.
“The failure has been isolated to the power electronics interface with the AC bus bar in the individual Megapack unit itself and not the broader installation of Megapack units,” the company said in the update.
The Bouldercombe battery, which sits roughly 20 kilometres south of Rockhampton on Queensland’s midcoast, was in the middle of the commissioning process when the fire broke out. The $60 million project is Genex’s first foray into big batteries.

Genex has been working with Tesla Motors Australia to investigate the incident, with Tesla undertaking preliminary analysis via remote diagnostics since the time of the event. On October 13, the affected Megapack was transported to a testing facility in Melbourne to complete further analysis via physical inspection. The full root cause analysis (RCA) into the fire is expected to be made public by Tesla “when finalised,” but in the meantime Genex said of the fire:
“On 26 September 2023, one of the 40 Megapack units caught fire at 7.32pm AEST toward the end of a discharge cycle. No-one was on site at the time of the incident. On advice from Queensland Fire and Emergency Services and established protocols the low intensity fire was allowed to burn out with no water required to be used on the fire itself.”
“On 28 September 2023, Genex re-energised the site and subsequently completed a charge of 5 MW for approximately 1 hour across 36 Megapack units on the evening of 28 September 2023.”
Tesla will replace two identified power electronics units and is inspecting the remainder of the Bouldercombe units. Tesla has also advised the Megapack unit adjacent to the impacted Megapack suffered minor thermal damage to its electrical insulation. Tesla will provide two Megapack units to replace those impacted. The units have already been shipped and are expected to arrive and complete installation and final testing in early December 2023.
To keep the commissioning process on track, Genex said its final tests and operations will recommence with 38 of the 40 Megapack units. The battery is expected to go into operation by mid-November 2023, Genex says.
The fire analysis and Megapack replacement is being undertaken at Tesla’s full cost.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/07/50-electricity-poles-across-sydney-mounted-with-ev-chargers-in-arena-backed-project/,"EV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 7, 2023",50 power poles across Sydney mounted with EV chargers in ARENA-backed project,"A number of densely populated areas of Sydney and the Hunter Region will have 22 kW pole mounted electric vehicle (EV) chargers energised before the year is out, as part of Intellihub’s EV Streetside Charging project, which attracted $871,000 (USD 565,00) in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).
The $2.04 million project to install EV chargers on public power poles is being rolled out by smart meter and infrastructure-as-a-service company, Intellihub, owned by private equity firm Pacific Equity Partners’ Group.
The first charger was energised today in Sydney’s Wolli Creek and chargers have also gone live in Lane Cove and St Leonards in Sydney’s north and at Maroubra, Coogee and North Bondi in Sydney’s east.
Another 41 EV chargers are being installed in St George, Sydney’s Eastern Suburbs and Northern Beaches regions, and the Lake Macquarie and Singleton regions in the Hunter Valley. These will progressively come online by the end of the year, Intellihub says.

The 22 kW EV chargers, supplied by Schneider Electric, all connect to the Ausgrid electricity network with Origin Energy providing accredited GreenPower for the project.
“EV drivers will be able to book a charging session, and then simply drive up, park and charge,”Intellihub CEO Wes Ballantine said of the public infrastructure. “A two hour charging session will typically provide enough charge for around 200 kilometres of driving.” No information has been provided on cost.
ARENA backed the trial to help expand knowledge around the regulatory and commercial barriers for public EV charging, as well as uptake by EV owners across different locations and incentives. Intellihub also says the project will help research into vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology by tracking impacts on the electricity network.
“Around 9% of all new car sales in Australia are now electric vehicles, and in some areas of Sydney the rates of EV adoption are double the national average,” Ballantine said.
This 9% rate is two and half times more than it was this time last year, showing Australia’s uptake has accelerated dramatically. Be that as it may, most people living in apartments, terraces and other high-density residences do not have off-street parking and cannot install EV charging infrastructure.
“A lack of charging infrastructure is a challenge to the uptake of EVs, with a quarter of Australian households currently unable to charge from home because they don’t have access to off-street parking,” Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen, said.
“By 2030, most experts expect that there will be more than one million electric vehicles on Australian roads,” Intellihub’s Ballantine added.

While the company’s latest model, the GEN24, still has lead times today because of a backlog of orders, another shipment of the GEN24 Primo 10 kW is expected in mid-November and should finally clear the backlog.
“We did underestimate how quickly the market would jump on those new products and also were really positively surprised about the loyalty of customers despite past stock issues,” Fronius Australia’s Managing and Sales Director, Mariella Doppelbauer, told pv magazine Australia.

Fronius has long been Australia’s most popular residential inverter brand, with its marketshare sitting at around 23% at the end of 2022. That same year, Fronius began a major expansion of its manufacturing plants in Europe, going from 4 GW of capacity to 7 GW. This process, however, disrupted the company’s production. 
It also coincided with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine which saw demand for renewable energy products in Europe skyrocket. The company opted to allocate its limited supply to its home market, causing the shortages in Australia.

These supply issues saw the company’s marketshare drop to below 15% after Q2, 2023. Austerity measures for Australia are now over though, with Doppelbauer saying “low stock levels are definitely a thing of the past no matter which power class or product.”
With supplies finally back, Fronius plans to spend the next period clawing back the lost marketshare, saying its solid customer relationships and serviceability in Australia will work in its favour. The company will also shift from its previous modus of managing expectations into proactively marketing its newest products.
How effective this campaign will be, only time will tell, but some in the industry believe the quality gap between European and Chinese inverter brands has diminished significantly in the past five years. With Fronius simply not an option for many installers over 2023, businesses turned to brands like Sungrow, Growatt and Goodwe, often reporting better than expected experiences.

Enel has abandoned its hydrogen plans in La Spezia, Italy, citing economic sustainability issues tied to a lack of prospective clients despite being awarded €13.72 million in European funds to build a green hydrogen plant, according to sources. A confirmation letter is expected to arrive at regional authorities today. Enel dropped a hydrogen project in Corigliano Rossano, Calabria, in August but continues other projects in Italy.
Toyota Motor has unveiled its all-new Crown Sedan model in Japan, offering an FCEV version alongside an HEV version, driven by its commitment to a hydrogen-powered society. The FCEV Crown Sedan uses the same fuel-cell system as the Mirai and offers an 820-kilometre range after a three-minute hydrogen refill, with a launch planned for November 13. Toyota’s technical chief, Hiroki Nakajima, acknowledged the FCEV Mirai’s challenges, pointing to the scarcity and complexity of hydrogen refuelling stations.
P2X Solutions said it will supply green hydrogen to Danisco Sweeteners, a part of International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF), for use at its plant in Kotka, Finland, for xylitol production under the brand name XIVIA. Green hydrogen production will commence at P2X Solutions’ Harjavalta, Finland plant in 2024.
Enapter has delivered its AEM Flex 120 electrolyzer to ABC-Klinkergruppe in Hörstel, Germany, with production set to begin by the end of the year. The AEM Flex 120 will produce hydrogen to replace the natural gas typically used for process heat, with plans to gradually reach a 100% hydrogen gas mix. Enapter has received orders for 26 AEM Flex 120 electrolyzers, bridging the market gap between its EL 4 (1 kg/day) and AEM Multicore (450 kg/day) electrolysers.
Corinth Pipeworks has secured two contracts worth over €10 million from Società Gasdotti Italia (SGI) to produce and supply approximately 82km of high-frequency welding steel pipes (HFW) for the Southern Italy gas pipeline network, designed to transport up to 100% hydrogen, with projects spanning Molise, Lazio, and Apulia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/07/clearvue-to-add-82-kw-of-solar-glass-to-greenhouse-in-california/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 7, 2023",ClearVue to add 82 kW of solar glass to greenhouse in California,"From pv magazine USA
System USA, a greenhouse operator, said this week that it has recruited ClearVue to install clear solar glass on a greenhouse in California. The solar glass will provide approximately 82 kW of electricity, with an estimated 107,000 kWh per year. The project is expected reduce annual operating costs.
ClearVue developed its single-pane laminate glazing in partnership with D2Solar.
The company uses nano- and micro-particle technology to internally diffuse, redistribute and reflect elements of incoming light towards the edges of its clear glass panel, where it is collected by monocrystalline silicon PV modules. The modules are placed into a circuit, which is designed to collect energy rays from multiple directions.
The California project build on previous solar greenhouse projects, including the Murdoch University R&D Greenhouse in Perth, Australia, operational since 2021. It also installed solar glass at the Sendai Ignis resort in Japan via its licensee Tomita Technologies.
At the test installation in Perth, daily average energy production is near 1.6 kWh generated by about 25 square meters of solar windows. The installation produced about 500 kWh over the course of a year of operations from 2019 to 2020. The company said a 1000 square meter installation could produce about 70 kWh per day.
“Greenhouses have been an integral part of our strategy from day one as we understood the growing global need for renewable energy solutions for sustainable agriculture,” said Martin Deil, chief executive officer of ClearVue Technologies. 
ClearVue PV technology uses an activated interlayer, sandwiched between two or three glass panes, some of which feature specialized thin-films and low-emissivity coating, enabling PV production without compromising natural daylight for crops below and maintaining a high color rendering index (CRI) of up to 99%. The technology can yield up to 32.5% energy cost savings compared to traditional single-glazing greenhouse panels.
“ClearVue glass also has the potential to add efficiency to automobiles, public transport, agriculture and mobile electronic devices,” said the company.
