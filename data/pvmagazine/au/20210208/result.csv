As universities around Australia prepare to return to learning in 2021, this microgrid simulator will become a hub for building capacity in the Northern Territory to understand, develop and run grids incorporating high proportions of renewable energy.
Since 2017, the Northern Territory Government has had a target to achieve 50% renewable generation of electricity by 2030, and in July last year it officially set a goal for net-zero emissions by 2050.
Although it faces similar challenges to other Australian states in terms of integrating large amounts of rooftop and large-scale solar into its electricity mix, the configuration of its power system is unique, fragmented into a large number of offgrid communities, many still powered mainly by diesel, and three main networks — the Darwin-Katherine Interconnected System, Alice Springs power system and the Tennant Creek power system.
“These are all very different to the National Electricity Market connected system, because they’re much smaller. We will get to 50%, but there’s an education process on how to make sure that it’s done in a safe reliable way,” says Juergen Zimmermann, Business Development and Technology Manager at Hitachi ABB Power Grids, who is also a long-time resident of the Northern Territory. 
“The simulation facility can build confidence and ensure that everyone is pulling in the same direction,” he tells pv magazine Australia.
Envisaged by Hitachi ABB Power Grids as a power-control simulator to enable scenario testing without transporting potentially unsuitable equipment to remote locations, the facility has also helped to integrate increasing amounts of solar energy into NT grids; and has been used to model seamless transition to localised supply when power systems are either overloaded or sections of the grid become disconnected due to weather events such as lightning strikes.
The Microgrid Control Systems Testing Facility combines Hitachi ABB software and equipment with the products of other manufacturers. It includes a generator simulator comprising various units; a feeder (or transmission line) simulator; solar and wind farm simulators; a grid-support simulator; an active real and reactive load simulator; a SCADA system and remote access simulation.
These various components can be scaled and configured to best match the microgrid being tested.
“It’s like a flight simulator, where you sit at the same controls as a real life system. The equipment behaves just as it would in reality,” says Zimmermann.
Director of the Energy and Resources Institute (ERI), Professor Suresh Thennadil, said at the handover of the simulator that, “The research at the ERI using the facility will be highly relevant not only to the NT, particularly remote areas where there are multiple energy inputs, but also for other parts of Australia and the world.”
Zimmermann describes remote communities as low-hanging fruit on the road to decarbonisation of the Northern Territory.
In April 2019, the Territory Labor government announced completion of its Solar Energy Transformation Program (SETuP) which deployed 10 MW of PV capacity across 25 individual sites that had existing diesel power stations, to reduce the use of diesel at those sites by 15%. 
“To encourage more distributed PV take up in remote and indigenous communities requires a greater awareness of what can be done, and how it can be done with local capacity building,” says Zimmermann.
He adds, “These systems are complex, and someone has to maintain them. It’s great to have local people who can do this.”
Handing the facility over to CDU also has the benefit of drawing engineers, data scientists, city planners and researchers from other faculties into exploring renewable possibilities.
For example, says Zimmermann, the opening of the microgrid simulator as part of the university attracted a transport expert interested in introducing electric buses — “He asked me how you set up the charging network”; a hydrogen proponent from the government who wants to deploy hydrogen in remote communities and asked about integrating it as a green power source.
He says, that engineers working in power systems, don’t realise what other key players don’t know, and opening a facility such as the simulator for more general use brings a broader range of aspirations into play.
To help the university’s power systems experts become familiar with how to operate their new asset — “how to make changes to software, test out new algorithms, configure the system for different types of microgrids and so on”, says Zimmermann — Hitachi ABB has signed a two-year support agreement with CDU.
Zimmermann hopes to also continue to spread awareness among government ministers from different portfolios about what’s possible in the grid space.
Hitachi-ABB will still use the simulator on occasion, booking time from the Energy and Resources Institute in order to test microgrid configurations designed, for instance, to bring low-emissions power to mining operations that have principally relied on gas-fired and diesel-fuelled generation.
Mining companies are now rapidly adopting renewable generation, observes Zimmermann: “FMG and Rio Tinto are becoming leaders in this space by challenging themselves on how they do things. It’s very encouraging to see them getting on top of deploying renewables for good reasons — because it makes sense economically and from a customer point of view.”
But he says, the question remains how quickly the Northern Territory on the whole can transition, how many different energy sources, stabilisers and storage capabilities need to be deployed, and in what combination.
The Clean Energy Council’s Clean Energy Report 2020 calculated Northern Territory renewable generation at 8% of its requirements at the end of 2019; the government itself anticipated reaching 16% penetration of renewables by the end of 2021.
Zimmermann looks forward to collaborations on the simulator that will utilise a wide range of ideas and knowledge to create electricity systems that are optimised for lowest emissions and greatest reliability on the way to net zero emissions.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/08/australias-first-large-scale-solar-panel-recycling-operation-amps-up-collection-of-precious-waste/,"SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"FEBRUARY 8, 2021",Australia’s first large-scale solar panel recycling operation amps up collection of precious “waste”,"For Clive Fleming, getting development approval for his business, Reclaim PV Recycling, to set up Australia’s first large scale solar-panel recycling plant, and taking a long-term lease on an industrial property in Lonsdale, just outside Adelaide in South Australia, is a major milestone after years of research and logistical modelling in his efforts to stop broken or end-of-life solar panels going to landfill,.
With the facility site secured, Fleming is today kickstarting a nationwide collection network for his business by sending a callout to industry operators — solar suppliers, installers, maintenance operations — around Australia to nominate their business sites as recycling depots. 
Participants need about 48 square metres of free space, and be willing to store up to three pallets of no longer useful solar panels. Around the three-pallet mark, Reclaim PV will organise pickup of the panels and transport them to Adelaide, in the first instance — Fleming is currently securing panel-processing sites in other states.
“Having a network of drop-off sites will significantly reduce the costs of transporting the panels to our warehouses and recycling facilities, compared to picking up 10 panels here, 15 panels there,” Fleming tells pv magazine Australia.
In 2015 Sustainability Victoria estimated that Australia’s installed solar infrastructure has a 15- to 35-year expected lifetime, so the waves of end-of-life panels are not expected to hit the dirt for another decade or so. 
Recognising the enormity of the impending recycling task when as solar service providers they were told to dump 600 decommissioned panels from a site in 2011, Fleming and former business partner David Galloway started Reclaim PV .
After pursuing grant-funded research into the best methods of separating the solar sandwich of materials bound together by adhesives such as ethyl vinyl acetate, the company developed a recycling process using pyrolysis — the staged application of heat in a furnace to peel away or melt the various components of the panels which are then recovered, sorted and sold to materials companies for reuse.
For the past few years Reclaim PV has been processing a test trickle of around 10,000 panels per annum,  partnering with major manufacturers — such as Q Cells, Suntech, Canadian Solar, Yingli and Sunpower — which pay to recycle their solar panels that have failed under warranty or been damaged in transit; and collecting the detritus of decommissioning or freak events such as the hailstorms that battered parts of south east Queensland in November 2020.

The proportion of materials potentially recoverable from solar panels is typically glass (75%), aluminium (8%), silicon (5%), copper (1%) and smaller amounts of silver, tin, lead and other components. 
A 2016 study jointly prepared by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that 78 million tonnes of raw materials with a combined value of US$15 billion could be recovered from solar panels globally by 2050.
The alternative is that solar waste left in landfill can leach materials, such as tin, lead and cadmium into groundwater, causing health and environmental concerns, never mind the inconceivable volume of lost opportunities and ground hogging. 
Managing Director of Yingli Solar Australia, Tim Feng, tells pv magazine Australia that the company has installed some 100 MW of commercial rooftop and large-scale ground-mounted solar in Australia since it entered the market in 2012, which is when Fleming came to talk to them about the issue of stewardship and how the two entities could collaborate to ensure the integrity of the industry.
“As clean energy representatives,” Feng says that Yingli, “focuses on having the least impact on the environment during production, and once the product is sold, we focus on minimising the impact on that part as well.”
In mid 2020, in the absence of Federal policy to, say, impose a levy on solar panels, inverters and batteries imported into Australia and thereby help fund end-of-life recycling of solar waste, some Australian states began to take action. Victoria brought in a long-planned ban on the dumping of all e-waste, including solar panels, to landfill; and in August last year, NSW allocated a $10 million, two-stage grant funding scheme aimed at keeping end-of-life solar systems out of the ground we live on.
Known as the NSW Circular Solar Grants Program, the scheme was initiated in response to data that estimates NSW alone will generate between 3,000 and 10,000 tonnes of discarded solar panels by 2025, a volume that is forecast to grow to between 40,000 and 71,000 tonnes by 2035.
Fleming sees opportunity in the big numbers, which could make his business plan independent of government funding and fulfill his long-held vision for Reclaim PV to become the catalyst for a national system providing end-to-end recovery and recycling of solar panels in Australia.
He’s currently securing environmental licenses to conduct full-scale recycling in Lonsdale, at a startup rate of 70,000 a year, which is coincidentally the number of partly processed panels that he currently has in warehousing, just waiting for the company to hit full throttle.
Fleming is confident of future expansion, and continues to invite those involved in decommissioning solar, or companies replacing panels under warranty to contact Reclaim PV for pickup of their waste panels; while simultaneously calling on industry to live the dream and become part of Reclaim PV’s network of drop-off points for discarded solar panels.
The more sites that nominate themselves as panel pickup points around Australia, the more convenient the network will become to “un-installers” and electricians called on to disconnect and  dispose of damaged or faulty panels.
The more industry participates in a distributed depot system, less it costs Reclaim PV to transport the panels, the more competitive it can afford to be with fees charged by councils to accept solar panels as landfill, or process them as electronic waste.
“I’m appealing to these businesses that are handling solar panels, that have a little bit of extra space,” he says. “If we can do this as an industry, it will drop the cost of transport, and our recycling service, and we can all feel good about it.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/08/the-us-jumps-on-board-the-electric-vehicle-revolution-leaving-australia-in-the-dust/,"EV,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",,"FEBRUARY 8, 2021","The US jumps on board the electric vehicle revolution, leaving Australia in the dust","From The Conversation Australia.
The Morrison government on Friday released a plan to reduce carbon emissions from Australia’s road transport sector. Controversially, it ruled out consumer incentives to encourage electric vehicle uptake. The disappointing document is not the electric vehicle jump-start the country sorely needs.
In contrast, the United States has recently gone all-in on electric vehicles. Like leaders in many developed economies, President Joe Biden will offer consumer incentives to encourage uptake of the technology. The nation’s entire government vehicle fleet will also transition to electric vehicles made in the US.
Electric vehicles are crucial to delivering the substantial emissions reductions required to reach net-zero by 2050 – a goal Prime Minister Scott Morrison now says he supports.
It begs the question: when will Australian governments wake up and support the electric vehicle revolution?
Pres. Biden: ""The federal government also owns an enormous fleet of vehicles, which we're going to replace with clean electric vehicles made right here in America, by American workers.""https://t.co/figJbDMrpt pic.twitter.com/racgwk9VGw
— ABC News Live (@ABCNewsLive) January 25, 2021

 
In Australia in 2020, electric vehicles comprised just 0.6% of new vehicle sales – well below the global average of 4.2%.
Overseas, electric vehicle uptake has been boosted by consumer incentives such as tax exemptions, toll road discounts, rebates on charging stations and subsidies to reduce upfront purchase costs.
And past advice to government has stated financial incentives are the best way to get more electric vehicles on the road.
But government backbenchers, including Liberal MP Craig Kelly, have previously warned against any subsidies to make electric cars cost-competitive against traditional cars.
Releasing the government’s Future Fuels Strategy discussion paper on Friday, Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor said subsidies for electric vehicles did not represent good value for money.
(As argued here, the claim is flawed because it ignores the international emissions produced by imported vehicle fuel).
The Morrison government instead plans to encourage business fleets to transition to electric vehicles, saying businesses accounted for around 40% of new light vehicle sales in 2020.
The government has also failed to implement fuel efficiency standards, despite in 2015 establishing a ministerial forum to do so.
The approach contrasts starkly with that taken by the Biden administration.
Cars, buses and trucks are the largest source of emissions in the US. To tackle this, Biden has proposed to:
And by committing to carbon-free electricity generation by 2035, the Biden administration is also ensuring renewable energy will power this electric fleet.
This combined support for electric vehicles and renewable energy is crucial if the US is to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
US companies are getting on board to avoid missing out on the electric vehicle revolution.
The day after Biden announced his fleet transition plan, General Motors (GM)— the largest US vehicle manufacturer and a major employer — announced it would stop selling fossil fuel vehicles by 2035 and be carbon-neutral by 2040.
This aligns with plans by the US states of California and Massachusetts to ban the sale of fossil fuel vehicles by 2035.
GM is serious about the transition, committing $US27 billion and planning at least 30 new electric vehicle models by 2025. And on Friday, the Ford Motor Company said it would double its investment in vehicle electrification to $US22 billion.

A General Motors ad for its electric vehicle strategy which aired during the US Superbowl.
Using government fleets to accelerate the electric vehicle transition is smart and strategic, because it:
Biden’s fleet plan includes a clear target, ensuring it stimulates the economy and supports his broader goal to create one million new US automotive jobs. Prioritising local manufacturing of vehicles, batteries and other components is key to maximising the benefits of his electric vehicle revolution.
On face value, the Morrison government’s business fleet plan has merit. But unlike the US approach, it does not involve a clear target and funding allocated to the initiative is relatively meagre.
So it’s unlikely to make much of a difference or put Australia on par with its international peers.
Compounding the absence of consumer incentives to encourage uptake in Australia, some states are mulling taxing electric vehicles before the market has been established.
Our research shows this could not only delay electric vehicle uptake, but jeopardise Australia’s chances of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.
Australia is already a world leader in building fast-charging hardware, and manufactures electric buses and trucks. We could also lead the global electric vehicle supply chain, due to our significant reserves of lithium, copper and nickel.
Despite these opportunities, the continuing lack of national leadership means the country is missing out on many economic benefits the electric vehicle revolution can bring.
Australia should adopt a Biden-inspired electric vehicle agenda. Without it, we will miss our climate targets, and the opportunity for thousands of new jobs.

“Swinburne’s strong partnership with CSIRO means that we will be able to build on our focus of digitalisation and Industry 4.0, and support industry to enhance understanding of what hydrogen can deliver,” said Swinburne’s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pascale Quester.

The Victorian Hydrogen Hub, dubbed VH2, is intended to involve researchers, industry partners and businesses in testing, trialling and demonstrating new and emerging hydrogen technologies.
It will take 18 months to build and its remit ranges from exploring the storage of clean energy as hydrogen to promoting sustainable manufacturing using the green gas.
The $10 million boost to the combined institutes’ hydrogen-research ambitions comes from Victorian Higher Education State Investment Fund, which was created in response to the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic on Victorian universities.
That is, it’s in addition to the government’s commitment of $1.6 billion for the advancement of clean energy made in the Victorian Budget 2020/21, as the state strives toward its target to be 50% powered by renewable energy by 2030.
The education funding includes direct provision of $1 million to CSIRO for development of a hydrogen refuelling station to be co-located with the new hub in Clayton, Victoria.
“As Australia considers energy alternatives, we know hydrogen is clean and will be cost competitive, said Nigel Warren, Executive Director of Growth for CSIRO, “but a major barrier to it becoming a fuel source for cars and trucks is how to refuel, and the lack of refuelling infrastructure.”
He added, “The refueller is a significant step to removing that barrier.”

CSIRO has been engaging with car manufacturers such as Toyota Australia, to support the uptake and supply of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) in Australia which is already lagging the world in its adoption of electric vehicles (EVs).
On Friday the Australian Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said the Federal Government would not offer incentives for vehicle owners to switch to EVs or FCEVs, but would instead support the future fuels sector by: 
The Victorian initiative seems congruent with national aspirations. On the weekend, the Victorian Minister for Higher Education, Gayle Tierney, added purpose to the green-fuel fire, saying: “We are proud to be investing in this forward-looking initiative, the kind that will help build a smarter Victoria and help respond to climate change.”
Toyota Australia’s Manager of Future Technologies, Matt MacLeod, is keen to bring the company’s Mirai FCEV to Australia, and said the company looks forward to “working closely with CSIRO and their partners” on the VH2 project.

Swinburne is already partnered with Germany’s ARENA2036 (where ARENA stands for Active Research Environment for the Next generation of Automobiles, and 2036 denotes the “150th anniversary of the automobile”) facility in Stuttgart, home of the German car industry, that seeks to engage more than 40 partners from the global hydrogen economy in creating scalable solutions for a future low-emissions mobility sector.
“The Victorian Hydrogen Hub will be connected to a matching facility to be built by ARENA2036 in Germany,” said Professor Bronwyn Fox, Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Research and Enterprise at Swinburne University of Technology.
She added, “The international partnership connects the largest industry players in the hydrogen sector in both countries, as well as some of the largest users of hydrogen expected to drive future demand.”
Some names in the partnership include: BMW Group; chemicals, oil and gas and performance products company, BASF; Daimler AG, makers of Mercedes-Benz cars and vans, and Daimler buses and trucks; Fluid Logistics; Kromberg Schubert, producers of complex wiring systems for the automotive systems, and so, alphabetically on, reflecting the forward-thinking automotive ecosystem.
Swinburne and CSIRO are also connected to Australia’s Hydrogen Industry Mission, and thereby to “the wider Australian hydrogen ecosystem”, said Professor Fox.
The as yet nascent Hydrogen Industry Mission — one of a series of Missions announced in August last year, aimed at solving some of Australia’s greatest challenges — will build on CSIRO’s National Hydrogen Roadmap formulated in 2018, to help Australia work out how to scale up its domestic hydrogen supply along with local demand for low-emissions technologies, and support a hydrogen energy export industry.
As an educational institute, VH2 seeks to develop “the multidisciplinary capability that Victoria will need in the growing hydrogen sector through the creation of the Victorian Hydrogen Industry Capability Program,” said Professor Quester.
She added, “This is an excellent opportunity to advance the bright minds focused on creating a sustainable future.”
VH2 itself is expected to create around 300 new full-time jobs in areas such as research, engineering and construction.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/08/spa-town-south-australias-hot-water-systems-set-to-soak-in-the-solar/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"FEBRUARY 8, 2021",Spa town? South Australia’s hot water systems set to soak in the solar,"Subscribing to off-peak hot water used to mean heating your water at night when electricity prices were at their lowest. Today, with rooftop solar pouring into homes and overflowing into the grid when the sun is highest, the cheap-energy tide has been turned. A new trial announced this weekend by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and Solahart will take active control of 2,400 residential hot water systems in renewables-endowed South Australia, to help balance the grid, but also to bring lower electricity bills to homes with and without rooftop solar.
The trial is supported by both the Australian Federal Government (through ARENA) and the South Australian Government, each of which is contributing $1.98 million to the $9.9 million Active Hot Water Control project conducted by Rheem through its renewable energy brand Solahart.
Participating homes will be kitted out with Solahart PowerStore, a solar-smart, grid-interactive electric water heater, integrated with a home energy management system, with the aim of demonstrating a low-cost, scalable way for hot water systems to provide demand management services.
The Solahart PowerStore system typically works in tandem with a property’s rooftop solar system, using solar energy surplus to the household’s immediate needs to gradually heat water, rather than allowing that excess to flow to the grid. Solahart describes it as being like a battery: “it stores energy — but it’s more affordable”.
For homes without solar, it will likely be reconfigured to tap into times of cheapest grid energy supply — that is, when the grid is flooded with solar-generated energy.

“As more of Australia’s electricity comes from solar, we need to increasingly shift more of our energy consumption to daylight hours when solar PV is generating,” said ARENA CEO Darren Miller.
Being able to coordinate surplus energy supply with high residential loads such as the heating of water is one way of managing abundance to help both the grid and consumers.
In preparation for this summer, South Australia, which already has one in three households living under rooftop solar, rushed in emergency measures that would allow state distribution network provider (DNSP) SA Power to switch off large swaths of rooftop generation if the influx of energy became too much for the grid to handle. 
Hot water systems have traditionally been significant users of electricity in the early mornings and evenings, when the largest proportion of people are showering pre or post work, washing dishes and setting a load of laundry in motion. Helping householders to choose to switch when they heat their water and use other appliances at peak solar times is a more rewarding way to balance the system than enforced shutdowns.
The Active Hot Water Control project will trial various incentives to find out what motivates different customers — those with and without solar on the roof, and across socioeconomic groups — to participate in demand response.
As part of the project, Solahart will establish a virtual power plant (VPP) that aggregates the electrical load of hot water heaters among participants, curbs electricity use at peak times, participates in electricity price arbitrage, and provides network services to the grid.
Learnings from the project are likely to have countrywide application. “By aggregating and optimising the energy use of hot water systems and other household appliances, VPPs could play a major role in managing system stability and reducing power bills for customers,” Miller said.
Rheem CEO, Chris Taylor added that South Australians are leaders in the adoption and use of renewable energy solutions, and that this project and the technology used are unique in enabling residents of the state to participate “in the renewables boom whether or not they are able to invest in solar PV”.
Australia saw 7 GW of new combined — large and small scale, wind and solar — renewable generation installed in 2020, an 11% increase on 2019, the previous record year which had already clocked up 6.3 GW of new green energy capacity.
The continuing passion for rooftop PV is expected to triple the country’s small-scale solar capacity by 2030, with an additional 24 GW predicted to be installed over the coming 10 years.
“This project will help South Australia to get the most out of this boom and maximise the use of renewables in the grid, reducing pressure on the electricity system,” said Federal Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor in a statement on Saturday.
ARENA elaborated on the potential benefits of Rheem’s trial, saying on its online project page that it will:
The Active Hot Water Control project is also anticipated to create new jobs at Rheem Australia, and support local installer employment in the residential enablement phase.
