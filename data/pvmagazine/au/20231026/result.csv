Solpac was engaged to deliver a system that got as close as possible to eliminating the $1,500 quarterly power bill for the three-level house while using only the available roof space and staying within the PV 2x oversize ruling for hybrid solar inverters.
Solpac’s Philip Christian designed a solution that comprises a 17.6 kW rooftop solar system coupled with two stacks of BYD HV batteries, each connected to a 5 kW Fronius Gen24 inverter. To provide security for blackouts, a backup board was installed to allow the customer to power a selected number of circuits.
Honours in the under 100 kW commercial division were shared by Matthew Linney and Joel Cronan from the Australian arm of Spanish energy giant Iberdrola, and Mark Fanning from Melbourne-based energy retailer Flow Power.
The Iberdrola Australia winning entry comprises a combined solar and EV charging solution installed in a council carpark in the northern New South Wales town of Lismore.
The structure, which doubles as a habitat for endangered butterflies, utilises 99.68 kW of bifacial solar panels providing shade to almost 40 public carparks, including two EV charging spaces. Charging is provided through a 75 kW tritium DC fast charger.
Flow Power’s entry comprises a 96.8 kWp solar system installed at the Lake Mountain Alpine resort in Victoria’s high country, to help manage the extreme seasonal load, and reduce operating costs of the resort’s microgrid. The system comprises 167 solar panels installed on a 40-degree sloped roof.

Melbourne-based installer Greenwood Solutions took out the over 100 kW commercial division with a 350 kW+ floating solar array that the CEC said demonstrated “unparalleled excellence in design, installation, and meeting the unique needs of their clients.”
The Greenwood team of Sam Saada, Eddie Greco, Michael O’Mahony, Alex Musgrove, Joel Gilchrist, Veli Markovic and Pat Carne conceived, engineered, and successfully deployed a floating solar system, including a custom-designed inverter station, that is now helping power a Victorian wastewater treatment plant.
CEC Chief Executive Kane Thornton said this year’s winners had demonstrated innovation and ingenuity, and the inherent flexibility of rooftop solar to meet the energy needs of Australian households and businesses.
“The unique and innovative solutions showcased by our finalists prove that rooftop solar is the leading light of Australia’s clean energy future, and can be adapted to meet any needs from customers to slash their power bills, their carbon emissions, or both at same time,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/26/first-nations-lead-clean-energy-initiatives-beyond-juukan-gorge/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"OCTOBER 26, 2023",First Nations lead clean energy initiatives beyond Juukan Gorge,"Australia’s Pilbara and Kimberley regions have high rates of Indigenous land tenure, while hosting some of world’s best co-located solar and wind energy resources. Such abundance presents big opportunities for energy exports, green steel and zero carbon products.
Almost 60% of Australia is subject to some level of First Nations’ rights and interests, including exclusive possession rights (akin to freehold) over a quarter of the continent. So the stakes for all players are high.
 
In 2020, after news Rio Tinto had legally destroyed the sacred Juukan Gorge rock shelter in order to gain access to more than $100 million worth of iron ore, we wrote an article questioning how much legal say First Nations people would have over massive new wind and solar farms planned for their Country. We asked whether the move to a zero-carbon economy “would be a just transition for First Nations?”

Much has happened in the past three years, and while more needs to be done, some signs are promising.
First, the furore and subsequent parliamentary inquiry following the Juukan Gorge incident forced the resignation of Rio Tinto boss Jean-Sebastien Jacques. Companies were put on notice that they can no longer run roughshod over First Nations communities. Research in progress indicates the clean energy industry has heard this message.
Second, in 2021 the First Nations Clean Energy Network – a group of prominent First Nations community organisers, lawyers, engineers and financial experts – was created and began to undertake significant advocacy work with governments and industry.
 
The network has released several useful guides on best practice on First Peoples’ Country. Again, research indicates the clean energy industry is paying attention to the work of the network.
Third, there is a question whether the Native Title Act allows large-scale clean energy developments to go ahead without native title holders’ permission. We are increasingly convinced the only way such developments will gain approval through the Native Title Act is through an Indigenous Land Use Agreement.
Moreover, Queensland and Western Australia have both implemented policies and South Australia is developing legislation that make it clear these states will require renewable energy developers to negotiate an agreement with First Nations land holders. Because these agreements are voluntary, native title holders can refuse to allow large wind and solar farms on their Country.

As always, these decisions come with caveats. Governments can compulsorily acquire land, and many of the power imbalances we observed in our earlier article persist. These include the power corporations have – unlike most Indigenous communities – to employ independent legal and technical advice about proposed projects, and to easily access finance when a community would like to develop a project itself.
Are First Nations peoples refusing to have wind and solar projects on their land? No, they are not. Many significant proposed projects announced in the last few years show huge promise in terms of First Nations ownership and control.
In Western Australia the partnership between Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation and renewable energy company ACEN plans to build 3 GW of solar and wind infrastructure on Yindjibarndi exclusive possession native title. Mirning traditional owners hold equity stakes in one of the largest green energy projects in the world, the massive Western Green Energy Hub located on their lands in the great Australian Bight.
Further north, Balanggarra traditional owners, the MG Corporation and the Kimberley Land Council have together announced a landmark East Kimberley Clean Energy project aimed at producing green hydrogen and ammonia for export.
Across the border in the Northern Territory, Larrakia Nation and the Jawoyn Association have created Desert Springs Octopus, a majority Indigenous-owned company backed by Octopus Australia.
Still, much more needs to happen to provide Indigenous communities with proper consent and control. In its 2023 amendments to allow for renewable energy projects on pastoral leases, the Western Australian government could have given native title holders more control but it chose not to. And much needed reforms to cultural heritage laws in WA were scrapped following a backlash from farmers.
In New South Wales, some clean energy developers seem to be avoiding Aboriginal lands, perhaps because they think it will be easier to negotiate with individual landholders. The result is lost opportunities for partnership, much needed know-how and mutual benefit.
In the case of critical mineral deposits on or near lands subject to First Nations’ title, not nearly enough has been done to ensure these communities will benefit from their extraction.
To ensure the net zero transition is just, First Nations must be guaranteed “free, prior and informed consent” to any renewable energy or critical mineral project proposed for their lands and waters, as the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples makes clear.
So long as governments can compulsorily acquire native title to expedite a renewable energy project and miners are allowed to mine critical minerals (or any mineral) without native title holders’ consent, the net zero transition will transgress this internationally recognised right.
The Commonwealth government has agreed in principle with the recommendations of the Juukan Gorge inquiry to review native title legislation to address inequalities in the position of First Nations peoples when they are negotiating access to their lands and waters.
The meaningful participation of First Nations rights holders is critical to de-risking clean energy projects. Communities must decide the forms participation takes – full or part ownership, leasing and so on – after they have properly assessed their options. Rapid electrification through wind and solar developments cannot come at the expense of land clearing and loss of biodiversity.
Ongoing research highlights that when negotiating land access for these projects, First Nations people are putting protection of the environment first when negotiating the footprint of these developments. That’s good news for all Australians.

Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan launched the SEC’s Strategic Plan 2023-2035 in Melbourne, saying the state-owned body will focus on investing to accelerate the energy transition, supporting the transition to all-electric households, and establishing a renewable energy workforce.
“The SEC is back: we’ll invest in government-owned renewable energy, help households switch to all-electric and build the renewables workforce Victoria needs,” she said.
“We’re putting power back in the hands of Victorians, giving them the tools they need to lower household energy bills and make the most of the cheap renewable energy that will supply the grid.”
Allan said the SEC’s initial $1 billion will support the development of 4.5 GW of renewable generation and energy storage assets, including 2.6 GW by 2028, and build industry confidence to attract further investment down the line.
This renewables capacity will be used to supply commercial and industrial customers and power government buildings, helping to achieve the target for all Victorian government operations and facilities to be powered by 100% renewable electricity by 2025.
The SEC will also assume responsibility for the state’s renewable energy target projects by 2025 – which amount to 1.2 GW of renewable energy generation in addition to the 4.5 GW.
A major energy supplier in the state before it was privatised in the 1990s, the SEC was revived earlier this year with an initial registrations of interest process attracting more than 100 applications with a total combined market capacity of 24 GW of generation and 30 GW of storage capacity.
The SEC’s pioneer investment is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
Victorian Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said the achieving the targets set out in the strategic plan will require seamless coordination across industry and government.
“By 2035, Victoria will need 25 GW of renewable energy in the grid – and the SEC will be critical in securing the investment and workforce we need for the job,” she said.
“Victoria has some of the most ambitious emissions reductions targets in the world, and the SEC and its role accelerating the transition to renewables will be the key driver to achieving this.”
The measures outlined by the Victorian government have been welcomed by the clean energy industry but Clean Energy Council Chief Executive Kane Thornton said the state needs to ensure that the SEC strikes the right balance.
“It is vital that when governments make market interventions, that all consequences are taken into consideration,” he said. “We know that those poised to make significant investments are very keen to learn the remaining detail from Victoria, and all Australian governments to inform their decision-making.”

Construction of the $500 million solar farm, which has approvals in place to reach a capacity of 600 MWp, is expected to commence in the coming months with Acciona anticipating it will be complete before the end of 2025.
Stanwell Chief Executive Officer Michael O’Rourke said the energy generated at the solar farm will be used to power the Central Queensland Hydrogen Hub (CQ-H2) being built on a 236-hectare site alongside the solar project.
Stanwell is part of a consortium of Australian and Japanese energy companies that is developing the CQ-H2 project which would initially involve the installation of up to 640 MW of electrolysers to produce green hydrogen for domestic use and export commencing in 2028. It is proposed the project will ultimately scale up to more than 3 GW of electrolysis capacity.
“Stanwell has set out an ambitious strategy for what we will achieve as a business between now and 2035 and a key component of our strategy is to drive the development of Queensland’s hydrogen industry,” O’Rourke said.
“Our agreement with Acciona to secure the output of the Aldoga Solar Farm is a key milestone for us, as the Central Queensland Hydrogen Project undertakes its front end engineering design (FEED) study and progresses to final investment decision.”

If progressed, the CQ-H2 project aims to deliver renewable hydrogen to Japan and Singapore, as well as supplying large domestic customers in central Queensland.
The consortium has already initiated a FEED study with final investment decision expected in late 2024 and commercial operations targeted to commence in 2028.
The CQ-H2 project, which has attracted financial support from the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), aims to produce up to 36,500 tonnes per annum of renewable hydrogen from 2026, scaling up to 328,500 tonnes per annum in 2031 to meet forecast demand.
The confirmation of the solar supply deal comes on the same day that the Australian government announced it will invest an additional $69.2 million to develop the CQ-H2 project as part of its Regional Hydrogen Hubs program.
Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the investment will help build infrastructure including the electrolyser, pipeline, and underground hydrogen storage. The hub infrastructure will help support hydrogen production and use in Australia and overseas.
“Gladstone has strong foundations to host a thriving hydrogen industry, creating thousands of local jobs and position Australia as a renewable energy superpower,” he said.
“Renewable hydrogen will play a big role in our path to net zero, helping cut emissions in hard-to-abate sectors, and the manufacturing of green metals and other products the world needs.”
The federal government’s Regional Hydrogen Hubs program is delivering more than half a billion dollars for hydrogen hubs in Gladstone, Townsville, Kwinana, the Pilbara, the Hunter, Bell Bay and Port Bonython.
Stanwell’s PPA with Acciona is the second major solar supply deal done for a large green hydrogen project in Queensland this month.
Earlier this month, Genex Power signed a 337.5 MW offtake agreement for its planned Bulli Creek Clean Energy Project to supply power to Fortescue’s green hydrogen and green ammonia project at Gibson Island.
