Thermal storage relies on the concept of heating or cooling a storage medium so it can be used later for heating and cooling applications.
The $1.01 million feasibility study, set to last one year, has shortlisted two thermal storage suppliers: German manufacturer Kraftblock and Australia’s MGA Thermal.

Kraftblock’s solution proposes to use use synthetic pellets comprised of up to 85% recycled material as the heat storage medium to achieve operating temperatures of up to 1300°C. 
MGA Thermal, on the other hand, will use its proprietary Miscibility Gap Alloy (MGA) technology as the heat storage medium for operating temperatures of up to 760 °C. 
The idea is to provide eight hours of heat to Torrens B power plant, at this stage using grid electricity to charge what is essentially a thermal battery. Given South Australia already regularly generates a surplus of renewable energy, presumably the thermal batteries would charge during the daytime and could eventually run solely on renewable sources.
The thermal storage would then hopefully be able to generate enough steam to spin the plant’s preexisting steam turbine. Of course, this configuration has the added bonus of using existing infrastructure like the grid connection and transmission lines already going to Torrens Island.
If the concept works, the Torrens Island fossil fuel power station could be converted to green energy with thermal storage – a solution ARENA said it expects to be replicable and scalable with other thermal generators across Australia’s grid.
“Given the potential long lead time and geographic constraints of other storage technologies, alternative pathways such as retrofitting existing power stations with thermal energy storage could be a viable solution to add to the mix and address Australia’s medium duration storage requirements,” ARENA CEO Darren Miller said of the project.
“If we develop a blueprint here to run the generators needed for grid stability on green heat, then we have another way to generate sustainable power,” Kraftblock CEO Martin Schichtel said of the project.
Australia is expected to need more than 60 GW of dispatchable generation and storage by 2050 to support the uptake of renewable energy, according to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).
The most pressing need within this decade is for medium duration storage, between four to 12 hours, necessary for managing daily variations in solar and wind output as coal generators shut.
In 2021, AGL has “broke ground” at the Torrens Island site to prepare for the construction of a 250 MW/250 MWh battery, a project which will see it deploy grid-forming inverter technology.
The $180 million Torrens Island battery will be delivered by Finnish technology company Wärtsilä an will initially start out with a one-hour duration but will be capable of expanding to up to four-hours duration in the future (1000 MWh). 
In June, AGL also announced it would head up a consortium of industry partners to look into whether the Torrens Island facility could become a green hydrogen hub for domestic users and export.

Vulcan is currently working on its pilot project in Germany’s Upper Rhine Valley, one of Europe’s best geothermal resources. 
The company’s concept for producing ‘zero carbon’ lithium is to use well established geothermal energy technologies to extract the Upper Rhine’s lithium-rich brine and then use the more novel technique of lithium electrolysis to create the final lithium hydroxide product.
Vulcan Energy Resources
Lithium – by far the globe’s most popular energy storage material – exists in an uncomfortable position where the act of getting it poorly impacts the environment. But the promise of Vulcan’s ‘green lithium’ extraction has seen the company already close deals with big automakers. Eager to secure supplies for the transition from petrol to electric vehicles, in June 2022, Stellantis, which owns brands like Peugeot, Citroen, Fiat, Chrysler and Opel, announced a $76 million (USD 47.8 million) equity investment in Vulcan. Vulcan also has offtake agreements with the likes of LG Energy Solution, Volkswagen, Reno, and Belgian battery cathode specialist Umicore.
In terms of how the company actually produced this latest batch of high grade, low impurity lithium hydroxide, Vulcan says lithium chloride was extracted by sorbent in its pilot plant, recovered with water and sent offsite “where it was purified and concentrated by a third-party provider to prepare the lithium chloride for electrolysis to produce lithium hydroxide solution. The solution was then crystallised to produce battery grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate.”

“The embodied renewable heat within our brine means we are able to leverage sorption, a commercially proven process to extract lithium from brines that requires heat to work,” Vulcan’s Managing Director and CEO Francis Wedin explained. “Sorption is highly selective, which means that we can produce a very pure LiCl [lithium chloride] eluate. This in turn means we are able to use lithium electrolysis, a method of producing lithium hydroxide directly which by its nature produces a very pure product, in excess of the purity required for use in electric vehicle batteries, with minimal reagent usage.”

Vulcan’s pilot plant in Germany has been operating since April 2021, with the company now announcing it has sufficient data to complete the first phase of its definitive feasibility study, scheduled for early next year.
It is also began works on its containerised sorption demonstration plant in Germany. The plan is for the demonstration plant to serve as a facility to train Vulcan’s operations team in a pre-commercial setting, prior to commercial production targeted for 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/24/solar-at-night/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 24, 2022",Solar at night,"Despite headlines about solar overtaking coal as the largest generator in the NEM, the latest example showed that solar actually topped coal for only 30 minutes. Coal still remains Australia’s dominant electricity generation technology and still provides over 50% of our energy. We rely heavily on coal overnight from about 6pm to 9am, yet it will be gone from the Australian electricity market within 10-15 years.
Australia urgently needs a replacement. While in some corners gas is touted as a replacement for coal, it won’t help us achieve emissions reductions targets and address a rapidly warming planet. If Australia is to meet its emission reduction targets, we need a coal replacement that is renewable, fully dispatchable, able to provide multiple hours of firm capacity and be available to meet our night-time power needs.
Australia’s day-time power needs are already well on the way to being supplied by low-cost solar PV, and the proportion of daytime solar PV will only increase over time. However, access to multiple hours of reliable overnight renewable capacity is the challenge. While wind can be a great night-time renewable resource in certain places, it is an intermittent form of generation. To provide firm capacity from 6pm in the evening to 9am the following morning, renewable energy storage with more than 12 hours duration is required.
AEMO has indicated that 45 GW of dispatchable storage capacity will be needed by 2050 to deliver 620 GWh of energy. However, given recent announcements about early retirements of coal fired power plants, more storage capacity may be required sooner. The need for dispatchable storage capacity will further increase if there is an increase in overnight demand due to rapid uptake of electric vehicles, or if there is an increase in domestic and international emissions reduction targets. If all three of these factors occur concurrently, as is expected, Australia will face significant challenges.
Australia’s energy ministers, in August this year, agreed to fast-track options to ensure that firm renewable capacity and associated investment incentives are established to manage the risks of the disorderly exit of coal.
The energy ministers also agreed to fast-track an emissions objective into the National Energy Objectives to ensure that sustainability becomes a key aspect of future system requirements. 
These decisions establish the need for firm renewable capacity, in the form of long duration intra-day storage, as a critical priority to replace coal fired generation.
While lithium-ion batteries would appear to be the logical choice to solve this storage challenge, they are only cost-effective for short durations, around one to four hours.
Technologies with the potential to deliver cost-effective intra-day storage (ie. 12-18 hours), as required to meet Australia’s overnight energy needs, include pumped hydro, concentrated solar thermal power (CSP), hydrogen storage, flow batteries and compressed air.
Of these, CSP is the one best suited to Australia’s hot, dry and sunny climate. Globally, there are now over 110 operational CSP plants, with a combined capacity of just under 7 GW, delivering 30,000 GWh per annum, which equates to 12 hours of daily generation. 
With another 30 CSP plants expected by 2025, CSP is already delivering nighttime energy with the reliability of daytime sunshine in sunny countries all around the world.
CSP systems have similar strengths to coal fired power plants, but with no emissions. The zero-emissions component is derived from CSP’s use of hundreds of heliostats – specially designed and tracked mirrors – that aim the reflected sun at a central collector. 
Rather than turning the sun’s energy directly into electrical current – as occurs with solar PV – they concentrate the sun’s heat up to 600˚C and then store that heat in large salt tanks. The hot salt is then used to create steam to drive a turbine, just like a coal-fired power station. 
CSP plants typically have 10-15 hours of thermal energy stored, allowing them to cover the crucial overnight electricity market which is currently serviced by coal. 
Another important feature of CSP, which makes it popular in transitioning utility grids, is the system-strength and inertia that it provides to the grid. This is thanks to the synchronous generation from the spinning turbine which creates frequency control and ancillary services (FCAS) at no charge. This negates the need for expensive battery projects, which are currently providing an increasing proportion of FCAS and which themselves require condensers to simulate synchronous power generation.
Regional employment can also benefit from CSP projects, which require a large workforce for construction, and highly skilled teams for ongoing operations. Construction typically requires over 600 people for two to three years, with ongoing operations requiring 20 people for a 100 MW plant. 
In essence, CSP projects employ about five times as many people as PV and wind projects. The jobs themselves are ideally suited to people who’ve worked in fossil fuel power plants, due to the similarities in operations.  
Like wind, solar and batteries, long-duration renewable energy storage projects take several years to permit, design, construct and commission (although they can be built much quicker than pumped hydro). Given the urgency of the decarbonisation challenge, decisions to establish incentives to create the right environment for private sector investment are required now.
Such incentives do not need to involve large government spending. What is typically required is an offtake agreement of suitable duration and a market recognition that multiple hours of firm, dispatchable renewable energy capacity has a higher value than intermittent renewable projects, at certain times of the day. This is particularly the case for firm capacity overnight.
The USD 862 million NOOR III CSP plant in rural Morocco produces 150 MW, with seven hours storage, and is underwritten by a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). 
Direct comparisons between PPA costs of CSP and utility-scale solar PV are not easy. Typically, daytime solar PV PPAs are priced at less than half the cost of CSP. However, a PPA for PV, with 12 hours of battery storage for overnight use, would be ten times the price of a CSP PPA. 
Most PV PPA’s do not guarantee a night-time price, consequently the client pays the difference between the PV PPA price and the night-time market price. At present, this is not an issue in Australia because night-time power costs are low, thanks to coal. But this will change as coal exits the market and nighttime power prices become more expensive.
This question of PPAs is why the latest projects combine CSP and solar PV technologies, creating a combined daytime and nighttime PPA: PV during the day and CSP only at night. Dubai’s USD 3.9 billion Noor Energy 1 project integrates a 700 MW CSP plant with 15 hours of storage and a 250 MW solar PV system. 
It should be remembered that the current renewable costings that make solar PV look so cheap do not include the nighttime storage gap – a gap filled by CSP’s long duration storage. 
Solving the coal problem isn’t easy. But driving rapid deployment of proven CSP technology is one of the best answers we have if we are to successfully decarbonise, at the least cost, while keeping the lights on and the EVs charged up and ready to go each morning.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/24/underground-heat-exchanger-to-cool-down-solar-panels/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 24, 2022",Underground heat exchanger to cool down solar panels,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the University of Alcalá in Spain have developed a cooling technique for solar modules that uses an underground, single–phase, closed-loop heat exchanger circuit that acts as a natural heat sink.
“Our analyses, made for various types of residential and commercial installations, show that the system is economically viable with investment amortisation periods that range between five and 10 years,” researcher Ignacio Valiente Blanco told pv magazine.
The cooling technique involves the application of a heat exchanger onto the back side of a solar panel to remove excess heat. This heat is transferred underground by a coolant fluid that is refrigerated by another U-shape heat exchanger introduced in a borehole at a depth of 15 meters, filled with natural water from the aquifer in the underground.
“The cooling system needs extra energy to activate the pump of the coolant,” the researchers explained. “As it is a closed-circuit, the potential energy difference between the bottom of the borehole and the solar panel does not impact the power consumption of the cooling system.”
The scientists tested the cooling system at an off-grid PV installation, which they described as representative of a typical solar farm with single–axis tracking systems. The array consists of two 270 W modules supplied by Spain’s Atersa. They feature a temperature coefficient of –0.43% per degree Celsius. 
The heat exchanger of the solar panel is mainly composed of a set of six plastically deformed, flattened U-shaped copper tubes, each measuring 15 mm in diameter. The tubes are all thermally isolated by polyethylene foam and are connected to common 18-mm-diameter inlet and outlet collectors. The research group used using a constant coolant flow rate of 3 l/min or 1.8 l/min per square meter of solar panel.
The experiment showed that the cooling tech could reduce the operating solar module temperature by between 13 C and 17 C. It also improved module performance by around 11%, which means that during an entire day, the cooled panel would provide 152 Wh more than its uncooled counterpart, according to the study.
The academics introduced the cooling system in “Efficiency Improvement of Photovoltaic Solar Modules by Cooling Using an Underground Heat Exchanger,” which was recently published in the Journal of Solar Energy Engineering.
“With the necessary investment, the system is perfectly usable in conventional installations,” said Valiente Blanco.
