“We see Australia as the most important country in terms of investment for us to secure hydrogen which is essential for hydrogen steel manufacturing,” Posco CEO Jeong-woo Choi said.
“We plan to increase our investments in not only raw material for steel making but also across various fields in Australia including renewable energy, hydrogen and green steel.”
In terms of investment allocation, company has pledged $41.8 billion (USD 28b) for hydrogen production, including renewable energy generation and electrolysis. The further $18 billion (USD 12b) will go specifically towards green steel manufacturing.
This green steel investment plan sits alongside investments Posco has already made in Australia to develop resources such as iron ore, lithium, and nickel, reportedly worth more than 4 trillion South Korean won ($4.5 billion).
Australia’s prime minister Anthony Albanese, having recently met with Posco’s CEO in Canberra, said his government “will actively cooperate with Posco Group’s eco-friendly material businesses for the future.”
Posco has said it plans to use green hydrogen to produce hot briquetted iron (HBI), a raw material from iron ore processing. It will then apply its own hydrogen-reducing steel technology HyREX to create a semi-finished steel product.
Green commodities like green steel, fertilisers and so on are, according to BayWa r.e. Australia technology innovation and hydrogen lead Dr James Hamilton, the most sensible focus for green hydrogen industries. This direction is already clear in Europe, Hamilton previously told pv magazine Australia, but remains mostly a glimmer here in Australia, where emphasis is primarily on exporting hydrogen and its derivatives as a fuel.

Key findings from the poll include:
“We’re hearing from a lot of people now that they’d like to take the next step and invest in home battery storage to be more energy independent, but the upfront cost is a barrier,” Deputy Director of Solar Citizens, Stephanie Gray, said.
“There are simple steps the federal government can take to help make household storage more affordable, like introducing a rebate and providing no-interest loans for people to invest in clean technology.”
Exactly this rebate proposal was made by Independent Federal Member for Indi Helen Haines earlier this year when she tabled the Cheaper Home Batteries Bill which proposed making home batteries eligible for Small-scale Technology Certificates, the same scheme behind Australia’s thriving rooftop solar sector.
The proposal garnered widespread support with billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes applauding the move on Twitter, MP Zali Steggall seconding the bill, and peak body the Smart Energy Council describing it as “important” legislation.
Despite the support, the bill lapsed at dissolution in April.
The landscape in Australia and worldwide has changed significantly since then, with most notably Russia’s invasion of Ukraine impacting global energy markets, as well as Australia’s federal government changing hans for the first time in a decade this May.
Solar Citizen’s survey result come as coal and gas prices are expected to drive up electricity prices in Australia by 56% over the next two years.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/07/surprise-as-cwp-renewables-sells-to-twiggy-forrest-company-in-4b-deal/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"DECEMBER 7, 2022",Surprise as CWP Renewables sells to Twiggy Forrest company in $4b deal,"The soon-to-be-former owners of CWP Renewables, Swiss asset manager Partners Group, announced on Wednesday December 7 it would be selling the company to the Forrest family’s Squadron Energy. 
The deal will see Squadron take control of CWP Renewables’ portfolio which has 1.1 GW of operational assets, as well as 5 GW of near-medium term projects and an additional 15 GW at an early stage of development. 
The deal is a major play for billionaire Andrew ‘Twiggy’ Forrest, who is among the world’s loudest green hydrogen enthusiasts, placing him now squarely in the fray of Australia’s grid decarbonisation – a transition increasingly looking like it will be directed by a handful of powerful billionaires. Following the acquisition, Squadron will have an operating renewables portfolio of 2.4 GW, with a further 20 GW in the development pipeline.

Forrest is framing the deal as a win for Australian interests, saying “Squadron is proud to bring a very significant portion of Australia’s renewable energy assets home to local ownership.”
“It means that Squadron has the renewable energy critical mass to help Australia step beyond fossil fuels,” Forrest said, playing into the undercurrent of concern around foreign ownership of energy assets.
Squadron’s bid for CWP Renewables, previously unreported on, won out against more publicised plays from Spanish company Iberdrola, one of the biggest utilities in the world; Tilt Renewables, owned by Queensland Investment Corporation and AGL Energy; as well as a bid from Origin Energy and its Canadian pension fund partner CDPQ.
CWP Renewables is the Australian outfit for CWP, though CWP Renewables and CWP Global are today two separated entities. The Swiss Partners Group has been increasing its stake in CWP Renewables over the last years, before merging its own platform with CWP Renewables in 2020.
Squadron seems to be leaning into CWP Renewables history of delivering power to some of Australia’s major commercial and industrial players, including Woolworths Group, Commonwealth Bank, Snowy Hydro, Transurban and Sydney Airport.
Squadron said CWP Renewables’ imminent integration into the company will give it the necessary scale to meet the “huge demand” from large C&I players for green energy. The focus here will primarily be on Australia’s east coast, with New South Wales and Victoria singled out as having “unparalleled development” unlocked through the deal.
CWP Renewables primarily operates wind assets, including the 270 MW Sapphire Wind Farm, NSW’s largest; Murra Warra I & II with a combined 435 MW; and the 142 MW Crudine Ridge. It also has approvals in place to construct four more wind farms in NSW totalling over 750 MW, along with a construction-ready 414 MW wind farm, 180 MW solar farm, two battery farms and a firming power station.
“With this acquisition, we will develop and operate an extensive geographic portfolio of night and daytime wind, solar and storage assets that will ensure reliability of supply for our customers,” Squadron Energy CEO Eva Hanly said of the deal.
“We are currently building the $3 billion Clarke Creek renewable energy hub in central Queensland, which is the largest grid connected project in the country, and will be commencing construction of another 2GW worth of projects within the next 18 months,” Hanly added.
Once fully operational, Squadron says its portfolio will provide enough electricity to power 8.5 million homes, more than double the number of homes in New South Wales.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/07/compensation-framework-for-storage-proposed-by-research-institute/,"ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"DECEMBER 7, 2022",Compensation framework for storage proposed by research institute,"From pv magazine USA
PNNL researchers have investigated how energy storage used as a transmission asset could also be operated and compensated as a market participant, primarily in energy markets.
As an example of storage used as transmission, Jeremy Twitchell, a senior energy analyst at PNNL, said in a recent webinar that Midwest grid operator MISO selected a USD 12 million ($17.8m) storage project as a transmission asset in Wisconsin, instead of a USD 13 million transmission project. MISO’s storage-as-transmission project will recover its cost through MISO’s transmission system rates, approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), he said, and will not participate in energy markets.
The opportunity for dual use of such a project arises because “even on fully contracted, heavily used transmission lines, there is unused capacity most of the time,” Twitchell said. “We build the grid based on peak needs plus reserve margins, but we’re only at that peak a few hours a year.”
That means storage, when it’s not being used as transmission, “can go do other things,” he said. FERC “recognised this in 2017,” Twitchell said, and issued a policy statement saying that storage deployed as a transmission asset can also provide market services.
“FERC was doing this to reduce system costs,” he said, adding that FERC cautioned that a storage asset cannot recover all its costs as a transmission asset, and also recover all its costs as a generation asset, “and keep it all,” because in that case there’s no cost reduction.
The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) and MISO began exploring how to respond to FERC’s nonbinding policy statement, Twitchell said, with CAISO considering how market revenues could be shared with customers, but both closed their proceedings without resolving the complexities of market participation and compensation for dual-use storage.
Without clear compensation mechanisms to enable developers to recover the costs of energy storage investments, the investments “will not go forward,” said Charlie Vartanian, a senior technical at PNNL who moderated the webinar.

Enphase plans to build four to six new microinverter manufacturing lines in the United States, CEO Badri Kothandaraman said in a recent ROTH Capital Partners webinar. The new lines are expected to add between 4.8 GW to 7.2 GW of new capacity.
Kothandaraman said that the company believes it will be able to keep a majority of the USD 0.11/W production tax credit (PTC) released under the US Inflation Reduction Act, although it remains uncertain how the credits will be paid out. He said that Enphase will not make a significant investment in US manufacturing unless it can secure a significant return on investment and retain 50% or more of the PTC value. 
Enphase said it plans to work with three contract manufacturers on the new capacity, two of which are current partners. Kothandaraman said the company will commit to at least three lines, regardless of the PTC credit results, to meet expected growth. 
Kothandaraman said that Enphase expects steady growth in the US residential sector, and “hyper growth” in Europe. He expects that European growth will more than double year on year in 2022, after doubling in 2021. ROTH said there remains potential for another doubling in 2023, but Enphase’s management has set more conservative guidance.
