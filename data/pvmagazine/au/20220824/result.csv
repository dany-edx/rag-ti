Green Gold Energy has a number of projects in the works across South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales with a particular focus on more mid-scale projects. On its website, the company notes its “core business matches land titles of up to 40 acres (16.2 hectares) with the necessary investment” to build viable solar farms.
Earlier this month, the company hosted the “opening ceremony” for its Loveday solar and battery project, also east of Adelaide. 
The Loveday project has two stages – the first of which will involve a 2 MW/ 5.5 MWh battery to be completed by the end of the year, followed by a 3 MW “future expansion,” the company said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/24/brisbane-airport-expands-ai-program-to-help-meet-sustainability-goals-in-airport-first/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,SUSTAINABILITY,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"AUGUST 24, 2022",Brisbane Airport expands AI program to help meet sustainability goals in airport first,"The technology being used at the Brisbane airport comes from Canadian company BrainBox AI, which describes itself as an “autonomous building technology” company. 
After a now complete six month pilot in one area of the airport, BrainBox says its technology led to a 12% decrease in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system energy usage, as well as a 17% reduction in building equipment run-time. What’s more, no one complained about being uncomfortable about the airport’s temperature.
It’s a little bit tricky to decipher just how BrainBox’s technology works, with the company describing it as: “using deep learning, cloud-based computing, and bespoke proprietary process”. But it seems to simply be an energy optimisation tool, meaning it controls when and where energy is used – though BrainBox’s particular focus is on optimising heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in commercial buildings. 
The company’s CEO, Sam Ramadori, describes it as a “powerful yet painless” way to achieve emissions reductions – which would surely resonate with companies scrambling to improve their ESG credentials.
Why the software decreases buildings’ carbon footprints is just because less energy is wasted heating and cooling since snazzy AI systems predict what needs to happen and put the building’s HVAC systems on the best path to a pristine 23°C.

Brisbane Airport Corporation is the first operator of an international airport to use this type of technology in its buildings – though the Canadian company hopes it won’t be the last, noting it would like to target the industry because of its size and decarbonisation goals.
Meanwhile, Brisbane Airport Corporation’s Head of Asset Optimisation, Derek Boo, says the company is committed to “experimenting and adopting new technologies which can assist in reducing energy use that ultimately contributes to carbon emission reductions. 
“This is one of the ways we’ll meet our goals. Based on our successful trial with BrainBox AI, we have identified several other opportunities to scale the program and we are looking forward to seeing the results,” Boo added.
Back in 2019, Brisbane Airport installed a solar system with a capacity of 5.725 MW – Australia’s largest commercial and industrial PV system to be installed at an airport. The airport’s international terminal alone supports 1.8 MW with roughly 6,500 panels covering more than 22,000 square metres.
The total solar system generates close to 18% of the company’s annual energy consumption – which, given airports run day and night and all through the year, seems pretty good.
Brisbane Airport Corporation says it plans to add a further 5 MW of capacity to its solar system by 2025 – doubling its size.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/24/sas-whyalla-steelworks-hits-green-steel-milestone-with-first-batch-of-premium-magnetite/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"AUGUST 24, 2022",SA’s Whyalla steelworks hits green steel milestone with first batch of premium magnetite,"Global steel company GFG Alliance on Tuesday announced its mining arm, SIMEC Mining, had produced its first high quality magnetite pellets which the company says will underpin green steel production in Whyalla on South Australia’s Eyre Peninsula.
Steel has traditionally been made by putting iron ore in a blast furnace with coking coal. Unsurprisingly, this process is highly pollutive and accounts for as much as 10% of the globe’s carbon emissions.
Enter green steel – which sees renewable hydrogen used as an alternate reducing agent to create Direct Reduced Iron in an electric arc furnace powered by renewables. 
The processed magnetite concentrate, which is ultimately a high-quality iron ore product, comes into this process because it enables the use of hydrogen as a reductant and is needed to feed the Direct Reduced Iron or DRI process.
“The successful production of the Direct Reduction grade [magnetite] pellets is another significant step forward in GFG Alliance’s green steel transformation at Whyalla,” the company said in its announcement of the news.
Whyalla is set to be GFG Alliance’s “first primary steel plant to be transformed to green steel,” the company’s Executive Chairman, Sanjeev Gupta, has said. 
Gupta is something of a tycoon having bought steelworks, mines, and smelters across the world Australia to the Czech Republic. 
As the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported in March, the billionaire “may get a taxpayer-funded hydrogen power station next door to his Whyalla steelworks should the Labor Party win South Australia’s election.”
The Labor government did indeed win that election, and the new Malinauskas is pushing ahead with its $593 million hydrogen hub plan which will see it install a 250 MW electrolyser and a 200 MW hydrogen-fuelled power station in Whyalla. 
The South Australian government said in July that it had received 60 different proposals to realise its vision and it is now in the process of reviewing these. 
According to the AFR, land belonging to the GFG steelworks is one of several options being considered by the Labor Party to install its hydrogen hub.
Should everything go to plan, the government’s hydrogen hub would be exceedingly valuable to the steelworks, providing a nearby source of hydrogen for its previously announced Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) plant, which will initially be fed by natural gas from Santos.
On its website, however, GFG says the green hydrogen it plans to use in the process would be “produced from GFG’s own renewable energy projects including Cultana – one of Australia’s largest solar farms being built in Whyalla.”
It isn’t clear whether the company is planning to install its own electrolysers though or, rather, whether the electricity generated from its Cultana Solar Farm would go towards powering its electric arc furnace which would also need renewable electricity for the steel it produced to be classed as green.
Either way, the production of Direct Reduction grade magnetite pellets is important because it informs one of two future expansion prongs at Whyalla. 
Whyalla obviously isn’t the only steelworks in the world looking at converting its operations to green steel and, according to GFG, those other facilities will also need to use magnetite concentrate to do so. 
“High grade magnetite iron ore allows alternate iron and steelmaking technologies to be considered with lower energy demands and lower-carbon steel technologies to be considered,” Gavin Hobart, General Manager of Magnetite Expansion and Growth at GFG’s SIMEC Mining explains.
“Our existing iron-ore operation in Whyalla is home to some of the highest purity and most desirable deposits of magnetite in the world,” he adds. 
So the lucky Whyalla is hoping to export its magnetite to other steelmakers, as well as using it themselves.
In fact, earlier this year the company announced it would be significantly expanding its magnetite mining operations in up to three stages. The first stage, already underway, includes a 2.5 million tonne per annum (tpa) expansion which is expected to be followed by another 5 million tpa expansion.
The company’s ultimate goal seems to be to get to above 10 million tonnes of production per year of the specialised iron ore product.
As boss Gupta explains: “Our ambition is to not just develop the iron ore and export the iron ore, but to develop hydrogen at the same time by developing large-scale renewables and bringing them together to make hydrogen DRI [Direct Reduction Iron].”
Gupta wants to “at least” export Direct Reduction Iron made with hydrogen, “if not actually green steel made out of hydrogen DRI.”
While this all sounds promising, it’s worth noting that GFG Alliance is currently being investigated by the UK’s Serious Fraud Office. It is suspected of fraud, fraudulent trading and money laundering including in its financing arrangements with Greensill Capital.
Greensill had been GFG’s major lender until it collapsed in 2021, going into administration.
“The enquiries only relate to some of our businesses in the UK and do not relate to our Australian operations which continue to perform strongly,” a spokesperson for GFG Alliance has said. “We continue to focus on operating safely and delivering our business plans.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/24/the-road-to-new-fuel-efficiency-rules-is-filled-with-potholes-heres-how-australia-can-avoid-them/,"EV,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",,"AUGUST 24, 2022",The road to new fuel efficiency rules is filled with potholes. Here’s how Australia can avoid them,"From the Conversation
Fuel efficiency standards are applied to car manufacturers and indirectly set limits on how much CO₂ can on average be emitted from a new vehicle. Such standards lead to lower fuel costs for motorists and could help Australia meet its targets under the Paris climate agreement.
Importantly, Bowen noted any new rules must be ambitious and designed specifically for Australia. But implementing effective standards is easier said than done – and there are many potholes to avoid.
Without a robust set of mandatory transport emissions standards, Australia’s dependence on fossil fuels will deepen, and reaching our emissions reduction goals will become harder.
Road vehicles vary in the efficiency with which they use fossil fuels such as petrol and diesel. For example, large SUVs are usually less fuel efficient than smaller, lighter cars. And of course, electric vehicles operate without any fossil fuels at all (although the energy source used to charge their batteries determines how “green” they are).
Stringent fuel efficiency standards will encourage the auto industry to bring more electric vehicles to Australia, and reduce how many polluting vehicles it imports.
Australia is the only country in the OECD without mandatory fuel efficiency standards for road transport vehicles. Voluntary fuel economy targets were adopted for new petrol cars in 1978, but were not achieved in 2010. In 2020, Australia’s automotive industry announced a new voluntary reporting system for CO₂ emissions reduction of 3-4% per year this decade.
These rules are not mandatory, and the target probably falls short of what’s needed. Yet, the industry is promoting these standards as a template for Australia’s new fuel efficiency rules.
Mandatory fuel efficiency standards are at the core of energy and transport policies around the world. So this should be the first guiding principle of any new system pursued by the federal government.
Second, the standards must be based on real-world fuel consumption.
Setting fuel efficiency standards first requires selecting a specific “driving pattern” that includes vehicle speed, acceleration, deceleration and power usage, and are used to determine a vehicle’s fuel use and emissions.
The patterns also take into account local road type (such as residential, arterial or motorway) and driving conditions (such as free-flow or morning peak).
The voluntary industry standards now in place in Australia are based on a driving pattern called the “New European Drive Cycle” or NEDC. Among its shortcomings, the cycle assumes mild accelerations and constant speeds that don’t reflect modern-day driving.
This has led to substantial deviations between the NEDC assumptions about fuel use and real-world consumption.
Our recent research measured emissions from five SUVs driving around Sydney. After comparing our measurements with the Green Vehicle Guide, we found fuel use was 16% to 65% higher than NEDC values, depending on the vehicle and driving conditions.
And research in 2019 suggested that, contrary to official figures using the NEDC, the rate of CO₂ emissions for new Australian passenger vehicles was not falling – and may actually have increased since 2015.
Why? It’s likely due to an increase in sales of bigger, heavier vehicles in Australia, such as SUVs, as well as a shift towards more 4WD and diesel cars.
So it’s crucial that we drop the NEDC – and base the new Australian standards on a drive pattern that represents real-world conditions. This could be similar to the pattern adopted by the European Union, or a real-world Australian drive cycle.
The federal government should implement a single standard for all passenger vehicles – including all SUVs, without exception.
Australia’s voluntary system allows large road-based SUVs to fall into the same category as light commercial vehicles. This means they’re subject to less stringent fuel efficiency standards than cars.
This may inadvertently promote sales of heavy SUVs and, as a result, significantly increase real-world fuel consumption and associated emissions.
And Australia’s standards must also eliminate loopholes that could allow companies to comply with regulations but not actually improve fuel efficiency to the extent intended.
The considerations listed above are by no means exhaustive. And new fuel efficiency standards must be supported by other policy measures, such as reducing our reliance on private cars, and promoting public transport, walking and cycling.
Transport is Australia’s third-biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, and federal government moves to tackle this problem are welcome. But if fuel efficiency standards are not carefully designed, the sector will continue to let down motorists, and the planet.

Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have released a study which examines “the technical outlook, economic feasibility, and environmental impact of battery-electric containerships.”
Breaking from previous studies, the researchers have classified the volume of space housing the batteries as an opportunity cost, rather than a fixed technical constraint. After modelling a wide variety of containership sizes, as well as 13 major world trade routes, the research suggests that more than 40% of the world’s fleet of containerships could be electrified “cost-effectively and with current technology,” by the end of this decade.
TCP (total cost of propulsion) by ship type, route length, current (a) and future (b) battery pricing:

In graph ‘a’, (above left), the authors show the current viability of containership electrification, based on ship size and length of voyage. The grey and white areas of the graphs represent the shipping routes where the electrification of containerships would immediately lower shipping costs.
Using only technology available for purchase today, nearly all ships with routes shorter than 2,000 kilometres are economically advantageous, and ships with routes as long as 3,000km are economically viable.
Graph ‘b’, (above right), projects that price reductions to “near future“ battery technology are expected to roughly double the economic viability and range of electrified containerships.
Crucially, this research demonstrates that electrified containerships have an economic advantage over the internal combustion engine (ICE), even when the costs of environmental and health damages are excluded.
The differences in TCP are contrasted in graph ‘a’ (ICE) vs graph ‘b’ (electrified):

The authors present estimates of air pollution damages and the social cost of carbon for both ICE, (above left), versus electrified containerships, (above right). The grey bars in the chart above show that ICE containerships cause damages equal to or greater than three times the ship’s costs.
An electrified containership will also cause some environmental damage, however, the estimates of electrified ship’s air pollution, and the social cost of carbon, are only 1/12th that of an ICE ship.
In a future in which the costs of large ICE containerships will continue rising, as electrified containerships become increasingly cost effective, the authors posit that ICE ships (below, left) will be grossly more expensive than electrified containerships (below, right).

The authors show that at current battery prices, the electrification of trade routes less than 1,500 km is economical, and has minimal impact to ship carrying capacity. And when the authors include environmental costs, the economical range skyrockets to 5,000 km.
A 5,000 km containership would require approximately 6.5 GWh of LFP batteries.
The average cost of lithium-ion batteries has plummeted 89% since 2010, and is expected to reach US$50 per kWh in the near future. Assuming a battery cost of US$100 per kWh, the TCP for a battery-electric containership is already lower than that of an ICE equivalent, for routes less than 1,000km. And when battery prices reach US$50 per kWh, which is predicted for the near future, electrified ships will be cost-effective on routes as long as 5,000km.
The key technical constraint for battery-electric container shipping is the volume of the battery system and electric motor relative to the volume occupied by a vessel’s existing engines, fuel storage and mechanical space. The extra weight of the BES system is, however, non-trivial in determining a vessel’s power requirements.
Battery chemistry is another key factor in configuring electric cargo ships. Vessels that take short, frequent trips have lower power requirements, but would need to recharge quickly. These vessels should benefit from the high charge rates and long life cycles of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Long range ships already spend more time docked in each port – typically well over 24h – and could take advantage of the relatively low cycle life and high energy density of nickel manganese cobalt oxide batteries.
The Yara Birkeland is an 80m long, 7MWh electrified autonomous containership that can hold 120 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU), which makes 12 nautical mile trips.

For ‘Neo-Panamax’ containerships, (sized to fit through the Panama canal), routes less than 3,000km actually require LESS space for batteries and motors than the volume currently occupied by combustion engines and fuel tanks.
If this class of ship were to travel 20,000km on a single charge, the batteries and motor would require 32% of the ship’s carrying capacity, or 2,500 TEU.
We find that as carrying capacity increases, the percentage of total carrying capacity volume occupied by batteries decreases because larger ships typically have lower energy requirements per unit of carrying capacity.
The charging infrastructure for a containership traveling less than 10,000km can be accomplished using less than 300 MW. Containerships holding 1,000-3,000 TEUs typically spend an average of 31 hours waiting in line and berthing. The largest ships, holding 10,000-20,000 TEUs, spend an average of 97 hours waiting and berthing.
The infrastructure required to support such massive charging capacities is surprisingly affordable, largely due to the efficient logistics of ports, since berths are typically occupied more than 50% of the time. At 50% utilisation, the researchers modelled that the levelised cost of a 300MW charging station comes to mere US$0.03 per kWh.
None of this technical viability would exist if it were not for recent and ongoing improvements to batteries, inverters and electric motors. For instance, in their models, the researchers assumed ICE “tank-to-wake efficiency” of 50%, and electric motor and inverter efficiencies of 95% each. Electrified containerships are 80% more efficient than their ICE counterparts, and use 30% less energy overall.
For inquiring minds: one gallon of heavy fuel oil (HFO) contains approximately 150,000btu, equivalent to roughly 44kWh. But since even the most efficient internal combustion ship engines are no more than 50% efficient, a gallon of HFO produces no more than 22kWh of actual propulsion. Most modern electric motors are now over 90% efficient, and the most advanced prototypes are approaching 99% efficiency.

Renewable energy will climb another rung of the ladder in the energy transition in 2022, reaching 22% of all generation this year, said the Energy Information Administration (EIA). EIA categorises renewable energy as solar, wind, and hydropower, as well as other renewables like biomass and geothermal.
The category reached 20% in both 2020 and 2021. EIA said it expects renewable energy to account for 24% of all generation next year. The organisation regularly posts forecasts for five renewable energy sources: conventional hydropower, wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal based on its monthly historical data releases.
EIA tracks 11 distinct regions in its renewable energy generation report. In 2021, the top two regions for renewable energy were California, where renewables accounted for 44% of electricity generation and the Northwest, where renewables accounted for roughly 50% of the region’s electricity generation. EIA said droughts hampered the hydroelectric contribution to these numbers, but they still increased their renewable share in the generation mix through buildout of solar and wind.
The most significant growth in renewables generation share this past decade was in the Southwest Power Pool, where renewable energy has grown from 13% of the mix in 2013 to 44% in 2022. This was largely due to wind generation additions, said EIA. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas also increased its renewables share from 10% to 32% over the same time period.
Three East Coast regions had the lowest share of renewable energy generation in their mix, namely PJM Interconnection in the Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast, and the Florida Reliability Coordinating council. EIA expects these regions to remain below the national average for renewables through next year. Natural gas and nuclear are the most significant power generators in the Southeast and Florida regions, and in PJM, the most prevalent power providers are natural gas and coal.
A distinction should be made between “renewable” and “sustainable” energy. Johns Hopkins University describes renewable energy as something that comes from sources that naturally renew themselves to meet our energy needs. This can include such technologies as biomass, hydropower, etc. “Sustainable” energy is defined as energy that can support both the current generation as well as future generations. John Hopkins considers solar and wind as the primary sources of sustainable energy.
Following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, sustainable energy sources are set to be significantly boosted by long-term industrial policy. In a collaboration with research institutions called the REPEAT project, Princeton University said solar deployment may accelerate from 2020 rates of 10 GW of capacity added per year to nearly five times as much by 2024, adding 49 GW of utility-scale solar each year. Solar deployment may be well over 100 GW per year by 2030, said the analysts. This will lead to the presence of renewable energy in the total U.S. generation mix being much more robust a decade from now.
