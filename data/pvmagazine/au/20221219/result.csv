The $61.9 million (USD 41.5 million) Wallgrove Grid Battery has been installed adjacent to Transgrid’s Wallgrove substation in Western Sydney. To date, the Wallgrove battery has exported more than 23 GWh of energy, supplying the equivalent of the energy needs of 4,300 NSW households.
Developed by Transgrid in collaboration with the Australian arm of Spanish energy giant Iberdrola, the Wallgrove battery comprises 36 Tesla Megapack units. The system utilises Tesla’s “Virtual Machine Mode” to deliver synthetic inertia as a service as well as provide grid support and system strength to the energy network.
Transgrid Chief Executive Officer Brett Redman said the Wallgrove Grid Battery will demonstrate the technical capability of batteries with advanced inverter capabilities to substitute traditional inertia.
“It’s a proof of concept that the grid-forming technology, the inverter technology, the inertia support works, and now we’re able to say that it’s fully operational,” he said.
The power system currently relies on inertia provided by large turbines inside coal, gas and hydro generators to maintain a consistent frequency and help the system ride out any disturbances. As more wind and solar generation connects to the grid and fossil fuel-fired power plants are retired, alternate sources of inertia will be needed to stabilise the network.
NSW has the biggest coal fleet in the country, at more than 10 GW, but four of the five coal-fired generators are scheduled to close by 2033 at the latest. There is also widespread belief that the fifth generator could also close early.

Redman said batteries can fill the gap created by the closure of the coal generators by using software to mimic the mechanical movement of turbines.
“Inertia is like riding a bike, when you take your feet off the pedals it keeps rolling, but not for long, which is why we need to maintain inertia in our energy system to keep it operating,” he said. “Currently synchronous generators or condensers can deliver inertia for stability, but batteries can also provide a greater range of benefits at a lower overall cost. They can also store excess renewable energy and then release it when consumers need it to help keep energy prices down.”
Transgrid will own and maintain the Wallgrove Grid Battery while Iberdrola will provide commercial services to the energy market, including dispatch control and frequency control ancillary services, ensuring the full capacity of the battery is utilised.
The Wallgrove announcement comes amid a flurry of activity in the energy storage market with the federal government-owned Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) announcing a $176 million investment which will deliver eight large-scale batteries with a combined 2 GW/4.2 GWh of storage capacity across the National Electricity Market.
The eight projects receiving funding are to be equipped with grid-forming inverter technology and Redman said the Wallgrove battery is an early demonstration of the inverter functionality that the funding round is supporting.
“Our trial of network services like synthetic inertia paved the way for this next generation of batteries and will provide critical learnings while also delivering grid stability at a lower cost for consumers,” he said.

The Pacific Solar Hydrogen Project, planned for a 6,000-hectare site near the port of Gladstone, will comprise up to 3.6 GW of PV and battery energy storage. The integrated solar and storage facility will power a hydrogen electrolyser capable of producing more than 100,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per annum.
“It is one of the biggest projects that we or anyone in the world for that matter have undertaken,” European Energy Executive Vice President and Head of Project Development Thorvald Spanggaard said.
“We do believe that it is feasible and realistic to realise this project in 2026 not least because of the willingness of the local authorities in Australia to see the possibilities of moving ahead on the green transition and become a key exporter of the fuel of tomorrow.”
Sunshine Coast-based Austrom, which has secured the rights to four sites totalling 6,000 hectares in proximity to the Gladstone export hub, first unveiled its plans for the Pacific Solar Hydrogen Project in 2020, saying the ultimate goal is to generate green hydrogen for export through Gladstone Port.
Catriona Mcleod, the country manager for European Energy in Australia, said the project would also become a hub for renewable energy production and “e-fuels.”
“The vast energy resources of Australia are not limited to fossil fuels,” she said. “Being a hub for renewable energy production, green hydrogen and e-fuels is the logical next step for our country.”

Mcleod said European Energy will be doing the development work as well as managing the grid connection process for the Pacific Solar Hydrogen Project portfolio.
The project is part of a growing portfolio of renewable energy projects that European Energy is pursuing in Australia.
The Copenhagen-headquartered company, which established an office in Melbourne in 2022, said it is determined to acquire, develop, build, own and operate a portfolio of large-scale renewable energy projects in Australia.
“European Energy is now advancing wind and solar opportunities across the NEM (National Electricity Market), and as one of the frontrunners in e-fuels and green hydrogen I believe we are very well suited to accelerate the speed in which these projects can be realised,” McLeod said.
European Energy said it has a development pipeline of more than 20 GW of renewable energy projects across four continents and is currently constructing more than 1.2 GW of new energy capacity.

The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) has unveiled the grant guidelines for the first 58 community batteries with applications opening on Jan. 30, 2023.
This element of the program will enable community and industry groups, businesses, government agencies and research organisations to apply for up to $29 million in grants to install community batteries in specific locations across Australia.
The first 58 community batteries will be delivered across urban and regional communities around Australia.
The DCCEEW said it had released the guidelines before the program opens in January 2023 to give interested groups time to develop high-quality applications that demonstrate benefits for communities and value for money.
The department said applications will be assessed against a series of criteria, including providing a net benefit to the electricity network; supporting further rooftop solar installations, and capacity to share the benefits of renewable energy with those properties that cannot install solar.
Further grant opportunities for community batteries will be offered by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, which will develop a program to deliver the remaining 342 batteries of the government’s commitment following a stakeholder consultation process.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/19/australia-presses-go-for-offshore-wind-industry/,"SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 19, 2022",Australia presses go for offshore wind industry,"An Australian offshore wind industry is one step closer with the federal government today declaring an area in the Bass Strait off Victoria’s Gippsland coast as the first area suitable for developing offshore wind energy projects.
The declaration confirms the area where developers will soon be able to apply for the first licences for offshore wind in Australia. Further consultations will take place on any proposed developments, once feasibility licences are issued.
The declared area encompasses approximately 15,000 square kilometres, stretching from offshore of Lakes Entrance in the east to south of Wilsons Promontory in the west.
The future farms would be hooked into energy grids on the mainland in Gippsland and Latrobe Valley, with the potential to provide 10 GW per year of wind power.
The Star of the South project, being developed by a Victorian-base­­­d team with investment from Danish firm Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, looks likely to be the first offshore wind farm in the area after it was awarded Major Project Status.
Star of the South Chief Executive Officer Charles Rattray welcomed the declaration of the zone, saying it means greater certainty for the industry and local supply chains.
“Offshore wind will play a critical role in Australia’s energy system going forward,” he said. “It is pleasing to receive clarity from government on the boundaries for offshore wind projects, allowing us to take the next steps and continue investing in the region.”
Rattray said if the Star of the South project is approved and proceeds to construction, works could start around the middle of this decade with first power around the end of the decade.
Federal Industry Minister Ed Husic said the offshore wind projects could support more than 3,000 jobs over the next 15 years in development and construction phases, with an additional 3,000 ongoing operation jobs.
“The Star of the South project alone will support more than 2,280 jobs during construction and a further 300 direct jobs during operations,” he said.
“We want to see more large-scale projects built in coming years. This will help integrate Australian manufacturing with renewable energy infrastructure, delivering more jobs in Australian companies.”
The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water said feasibility licence applications for offshore wind projects in the Gippsland area will open soon. The Offshore Infrastructure Registrar will lead assessment of all applications and make recommendations to the Minister.
Other regions in Australia being considered for future offshore wind energy projects are the Pacific Ocean regions off the Hunter and Illawarra in New South Wales, the Southern Ocean region off Portland in Victoria, the Bass Straight region off Northern Tasmania, and the Indian Ocean region off Perth/Bunbury in Western Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/19/arena-big-battery-deal-to-deliver-4-2-gwh-of-energy-storage/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 19, 2022",ARENA big battery deal to deliver 4.2 GWh of energy storage,"The federal government has signed off on a $176 million investment which will deliver eight large-scale batteries with a combined 2 GW/4.2 GWh of storage capacity to help stabilise and balance the National Electricity Market (NEM) as Australia transitions from coal-fired power to renewables.
Funded through the government-owned Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) Large Scale Battery Storage Funding Round, each battery will be equipped with grid-forming inverter technology, allowing them to provide essential system stability services traditionally provided by synchronous generation such as coal and gas.
System strength services and inertia have historically been provided by baseload coal and gas power plants, but ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said grid-forming technologies could provide the necessary substitute as the penetration of variable, renewable energy increases.
“It’s the ability of this advanced inverter technology to support the grid without coal or gas that’s fundamental to the innovation here today,” he said. “We know we need the energy, but we also need those crucial system security services, frequency support voltage and the like that these new batteries can provide.”
The funding will see seven new batteries developed across New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. The batteries range from 200 to 300 MW each and will provide virtual inertia and system strength services to the grid.
The funding also provides for a major upgrade of the 300 MW/450 MWh Victorian Big Battery near Geelong. Owned by French renewable energy developer Neoen, the storage facility will be retrofitted to enable grid-forming capability.

All of the projects are expected to reach financial close in 2023 and be operational by 2025.
ARENA said with a total project value of about $2.7 billion and a combined capacity of 2.0 GW/4.2 GWh the projects represent a ten-fold increase in grid-forming electricity storage capacity currently operational in the NEM.
Miller said the batteries represent a transformative portfolio of new storage capacity and will help underpin the transition to renewable energy in Australia. And added that the need to smooth out variable generation and store electricity is essential for Australia’s transition to renewables.
“These next-generation grid-scale batteries will underpin this transition, with inverter technology that can maintain grid stability without the need for coal and gas generators. This pipeline of grid-forming projects will help move us closer to an electricity grid that can support 100% renewable energy in the NEM,” said Miller.
The developers and projects ARENA has selected for support are:

Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the successful projects, which include the first grid-forming batteries in Victoria and Queensland, will be a major step forward for Australia’s energy grid.
“We know that part of a renewable economy is being able to store renewable energy,” he said. “These batteries will help stabilise the grid and deliver the cleanest, cheapest form of energy for Australian businesses and households.”
ARENA has previously provided $81 million in funding for eight grid-scale batteries, including five with grid-forming capability at a smaller scale. The 150 MW/194 MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia, which received ARENA funding for its 2019 expansion, is currently the largest grid-forming battery in Australia.
The agency said the previous projects have highlighted the potential of grid-forming batteries and the need to support further projects at a larger scale to build experience with the technology, de-risk investment and drive further innovation from inverter manufacturers.
It said the funding round will also help to overcome current commercial and regulatory barriers to large-scale deployment.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/19/how-common-are-islandings-and-transmission-tower-failures-in-the-nem/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"DECEMBER 19, 2022",How common are islandings and transmission tower failures in the NEM?,"In recent months, two unrelated incidences of transmission tower failure resulted in separations within the National Electricity Market (NEM): In South Australia (SA), thunderstorms and strong winds toppled a transmission tower near Tailem Bend. This resulted in a trip of the Heywood interconnector and caused the SA region to be ‘frequency islanded’ for one week.
In Tasmania, a landslide displaced the foundations of a transmission tower near the town of Poatina. The adjoining line is a key part of the transmission backbone that connects the northern and southern parts of the state’s network. Both events temporarily elevated the level of risk in operating the power system securely. And the SA incident in particular, incurred significant market costs to the tune of $31.5 million until the line was restored.
In this article, I will provide some context about interconnectors and examine how they relate to recent islanding events. I will finish by presenting a list of known transmission tower failures for comparison.
Interconnectors are the bridges that link the five regions together and allow for inter-regional exports and imports. However, unlike a bridge, they are not so much a single physical structure. They are, instead, a construct of the mathematical model that underpins the NEM (i.e. the NEM Dispatch Engine).
Image: Watt Clarity
There are currently six interconnectors in the NEM, and they come in two forms:
· DC (Direct Current) – Basslink (Tasmania to Victoria), Murraylink (Victoria to SA) and Terranora (NSW to Queensland).
· AC (Alternating Current) – Heywood (Victoria to SA), VNI (Victoria to NSW) and QNI (NSW to Queensland).
It’s probably easier to conjure up an image of a DC interconnector, as the infrastructure itself is more-or-less a discrete cable (or group of cables) from one region to another with a terminal on either end.
AC interconnectors on the other hand are more abstract. In these cases, the ‘interconnector’ is all parts of a long complex series of essential transmission lines that connect one Regional Reference Node (RRN) to another, and it can even be the aggregate flow of several cross-regional transmission paths.
It is these AC interconnectors that maintain a common system frequency across regions, as the DC interconnectors have no such ability. A key benefit of AC interconnection is that some tasks (such as procuring enough energy to manage system frequency) can be shared across regions. However, an unexpected trip of one of these interconnectors can lead to rather large system security issues, price spikes and other economic consequences as one region is suddenly ‘on its own’ to manage supply, frequency, and the other complexities of operating an independent electricity grid.
As one observant WattClarity reader recently noted, the term ‘islanding’ is often used interchangeably to refer to one of three different types of events that can occur in the NEM:
· Economic islanding – When all (AC and/or DC) interconnectors between two regions are constrained, economic islands are formed on either side as regional spot prices can separate (sometimes significantly). E.g. If the VNI was the only interconnector in the NEM to be bound, NSW and Queensland would form one economic island and Victoria, SA and Tasmania would form another.
· Frequency islanding –When one or more regions lose frequency synchronisation, generally because an AC interconnector(s) is offline, a frequency island forms. E.g. If Heywood is offline but Murraylink is online, SA is frequency islanded.
· Electrical islanding – When all (AC and/or DC) interconnectors linked to a region are offline, an electrical island forms. E.g. If QNI and Terranora are both offline simultaneously, Queensland is electrically islanded.
Economic islandings occur often, while frequency and electrical islandings are rare and need to be managed carefully when they do occur. The event we saw in South Australia last month was the second major case within three years that SA was ‘frequency islanded’ from the rest of the NEM for an extended period of time. In a somewhat similar incident in January 2020, a transmission tower collapse on the Victorian side of the border caused the trip of Heywood, leaving behind a $90 million + FCAS bill in the process.
Islandings of this type are a particular concern for South Australia. As a region that deals with comparatively high levels of Variable Renewable Energy penetration and periods of ultra-low (or even ‘negative’) demand, the dynamics of its power system change dramatically when it is unexpectedly islanded in this way.
Image:WattClarity
If you remember, an interconnector is any part of a series of essential lines that connect two RRNs – the image above may help to depict the physical extent of the Heywood interconnector and show how two very geographically different tower collapses could cause similar contingency events.
Of course, it is not always the case that tower failure is the root cause of an islanding event as there are thousands of electrical components that compose what is mathematically modelled as an interconnector. The table below has been compiled to list all known frequency islanding events in the NEM back to 2010.

As Queensland and SA have only one AC interconnection with their neighbours (and both contain single double-circuited transmission lines), the risk of a frequency islanding event is elevated. The risk is much lower in NSW and Victoria as multiple geographically dispersed lines would need to trip simultaneously. This may also be the case for SA, once Project EnergyConnect is completed in the coming years.
Without AC interconnection, Tasmania is not frequency synchronised with the mainland regions (hence technically always ‘frequency islanded’) although Basslink’s technology uniquely does allow for transfer of FCAS. The region has to deal with its own set of issues when Basslink is completely offline (i.e. when it becomes ‘electrically islanded’) as was the case for an extended period in 2016.
The second component of SA’s islanding event was the collapse of a tower that carried a critical transmission line. A combination of factors can be involved in a transmission tower failure such as extreme weather events, corrosion, structural inadequacy, engineering defects or even sabotage. In Australia, it has been mother nature who has delivered the most knockout blows to the transmission network.
Depending upon location on the network, these incidents have had varying levels of impact on supply and security. While bushfires and flooding can affect structures in other ways, it’s more commonly wind-related events that have been their (literal) downfall. A 2020 CSIRO case study examined the risks of severe convective winds to transmission towers. The report highlighted that in relation to Australia’s aging transmission network, “Maintenance and upgrades consider several factors, including exposure, history of failure and physical condition of the tower, but generally towers are not systematically upgraded to today’s engineering standards.”.
Finally, it’s important to keep in mind that the list above only relates to such events on a transmission level. I can imagine that the list of incidents on the distribution network is an order of magnitude longer.
Hopefully this has helped paint a picture of how often these unexpected events have unfolded and how they pose significant risks to the power system. By looking at the timelines presented above, there may be some key lessons that we can take away:

The TCS3200 is a programmable colour light-to-frequency converter equipped with white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to illuminate an object’s surface for colour detection, with the object reflecting light to the sensor to determine colour intensities.
“TCS3200 can detect the colour of the light incident and output square waves with 50% duty cycles,” the scientists said. “Compared to other scientific instruments, this sensor is reasonably at a low cost.”
The microcontroller is the key element of the entire system, which also includes a 46 V motor driver, two 12 V DC motors, a charge controller, a rechargeable battery, a voltage regulator, and a roller brush.
“The roller brush provides a sweeping motion for cleaning the panel surfaces by spinning at a higher speed than the movement wheels,” said the research team.
The system also uses Arduino IDE software to write, compile and upload sketch codes for the system. It includes the connecting rods, the case shielding the electronic components, and the brush-driving devices.
The system can detect dirt on solar panels by measuring colours, calibrating colours, and comparing measured results with reference results.
“When the controller detects that the humidity threshold level signal has reached 80%, the motor driver will turn on to clean the solar panel,” the academics explained. “Motor A of the two DC motors in the setup moves the colour sensor across the solar panel for colour monitoring, while Motor B drives the cleaning robot to remove dirt.”
The group estimates annual system costs at $2.37 (€1.50) per panel, with capital and maintenance costs accounting for most of the associated costs.
“In one minute, up to 95% of the dust on the PV panel surfaces can be removed by this device,” the group said.
The scientists described the new cleaning system in “Solar panel surface dirt detection and removal based on Arduino color recognition,” which was recently published in MethodsX.
“The researched project is an improvement over existing systems since it eliminates many of the drawbacks, such as the need for water, manual cleaning, the need for labour,” the scientists concluded. “The system can operate for many years before requiring maintenance.”
