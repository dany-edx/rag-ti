Transgrid says its fleet of 400 diesel commercial vehicles and 28 passenger vehicles collectively travel more than 14 million kilometres each year. 
The electric ute trial will put the LDV eT60 to the test to see if it meets operational requirements, Transgrid Fleet Manager Ryan Thomas said.
“We’ll be gauging the impacts for our people working in the field, including charging and towing requirements, so we can better understand the issues that will make the transition to electric utes as seamless as possible,” he said.
The LDV eT60 double-cab ute has a 130 kW /310 Nm electric motor and 88.5 kWh battery pack.
“We expect the electric utes will deliver operational savings for Transgrid, including around a 50% reduction in our fuel costs,” Thomas said.
“EV servicing also has advantages, with the average electric vehicle having 20 moving parts in its drive train, while its diesel equivalent has over 2,000. When you have a fleet that covers millions of kilometres each year, these numbers are important to help keep costs down for customers,” he added.
Transgrid CEO Brett Redman was joined by Federal Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen at Transgrid’s Wallgrove depot in Western Sydney over the weekend to launch the trial.

If re-elected in the upcoming March 25 NSW election, the incumbent government says it will work with stakeholders to develop “right to charge” strata law reforms, meaning where apartment owners are willing to pay the cost and comply with strict safety requirements, their requests to install EV chargers cannot be unreasonably refused.
The NSW Minister for Planning and Homes, Anthony Roberts, also said his government is “only days away” from streamlining planning laws to make it easier to install EV chargers in public places like on power poles and parking meters.
“We know that 30% of drivers can’t access off-street parking and will rely on public chargers, which is why we are cutting red tape to roll them out even faster,” Roberts said.
Finally, the state coalition committed to installing public chargers at transport hubs, like commuter carparks and train, bus and ferry stations.

There are currently only about 1000 public chargers in NSW. But while Australia has notoriously lagged the rest of the world in the uptake of EVs, the tide is changing quickly – likely driven by soaring petrol prices and renewed government interest in EV policies.
The demand for electric vehicles in Australia increased by 65% in 2022, reaching 3.39% market share of total new car sales, according to the Electric Vehicle Council’s State of EVs report published last October.
In that report, New South Wales and the Capital Territory shared the top spot for EV policies, scoring 8/10.

NSW Treasurer Matt Kean expects more than 1 million EVs expected to hit NSW roads by 2030, with the state government previously committing $209 million (USD 145 million) to build out a comprehensive charging network across the state.
In terms of additional EV policies, the NSW government has previously committed to:

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/14/aluminium-giant-to-deploy-4-mw-renewably-powered-technology-in-wa-plant/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 14, 2023",Aluminium giant to deploy 4 MW renewably-powered technology in WA plant,"Alcoa plans to install a 4 MW Mechanical Vapour Recompression (MVR) module to be powered by renewable energy at its Wagerup alumina refinery south of Perth in Western Australia. The technology, which recycles waste steam that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, is said to tackle the most emissions-intensive stage of refining alumina.
Construction is expected to begin on the project mid-year and is slated to be operational in 2024.
The decision to move ahead with the technology was informed by a successful feasibility study, into which the Australia Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) contributed $11.3 million (USD 7.8 million).
The study found that once the capital costs of switching to Mechanical Vapour Recompression (MVR) have been met, it is significantly cheaper than current methods for making steam. In some refineries, the upfront costs of MVR are even cheaper than conventional evaporation, ARENA said.
Alcoa is planning to purchase renewable energy from the market with Large-Scale Generation Certificates (LGCs), rather than developing its own generation project, a spokesperson for the company told pv magazine Australia.

Australia is the world’s largest exporter of alumina and the industry accounts for roughly 3% of the country’s total annual emissions, using more than twice the energy consumed by Tasmania.
In 2022, ARENA published the Roadmap for Decarbonising Australian Alumina Refining. Developed by Deloitte, the report found that deploying four technologies could cut emissions at Australian alumina refineries by as much as 98%.
Of these four technologies, MVR tackles the most emissions intensive stage of refining, it said.
Vapour recompression via MVR is a way to upgrade energy by compressing lower pressure vapour up to a higher pressure. The process is itself a refinement of the proposition that renewables could be harnessed to produce the high-pressure steam needed to remove residues and solids from bauxite to produce alumina, the feedstock for aluminium.
While the results of the feasibility study into deploying MVR technology in Australia are promising, the move will require vast amounts of renewable generation. 
Alcoa’s feasibility study found that it would take 1.2 GW of firmed renewables for all of Australia’s alumina refineries to adopt renewable MVR.

The Australian Alliance for Energy Productivity (A2EP), an independent coalition of business and research leaders based at the University of Technology Sydney, has developed a free, online estimation tool for heat pumps for commercial and industrial applications.
The tool is designed to help business managers and engineers to model the impact of different heating temperatures.

“The goal is to find out in a few minutes whether heat pumps warrant a more detailed investigation for your requirements and whether you should seek out more information,” A2EP says on its website.
Users can input current electricity costs, process hours for use per year, average required heat, temperature of the heat sink, and water temperature. They can choose between heat pump sources, location, and using cooling in addition to heating.
The estimator returns the size of the required heat pump, coefficient of performance (COP), capex, opex, net savings, and payback time, with costs and savings presented in Australian dollars. It allows comparing the values for two natural refrigerants, ammonia (R717) and CO2 (R744).
“There is a lack of understanding across industry which we at A2EP are trying to overcome with resources and tools like the Heat Pump Estimator,” said Jarrod Leak, CEO of A2EP. “A lot of manufacturing and operations managers think heat pumps don’t compete on cost, but that’s based on the incorrect assumption that you need to replace a boiler with a heat pump of the same capacity, which is not the case.”
The heat pump estimator was developed by A2EP, engineering consultancy pitt&sherry, and energy equipment provider SmartConsult. It had support from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Australian Meat Processor Corp., and industrial refrigeration equipment supplier Mayekawa Australia. A more advanced version of the tool which supports more advanced sizing, including for thermal storage systems, is available exclusively to A2EP members.

An interdisciplinary consortium coordinated by Israel’s Al-Zahrawi Society, a Triangle Research and Development Center entity, has launched Regace, a new agrivoltaics research project for greenhouses. It will install Trisolar’s  crop-responsive PV tracking system in greenhouses across six locations.
“The TriSolar tracking system is designed to be used with specially designed semi transparent bifacial PV modules, that are optimised for this agrivoltaic application inside greenhouses, to optimize light distribution inside the greenhouse as well as maximising electrical output of the PV system,” a project spokesperson told pv magazine.
The Regace project will also evaluate the effectiveness of the PV modules, which were manufactured by an unspecified manufacturer. One of the other aims of the project is to test the energy yield of the tracker systems in greenhouses across different locations and climates.
“A first trial in a Mediterranean climate has shown that an increase of around 20% can be achieved compared to a fixed installation in a greenhouse,” the spokesperson said. “Due to it being crop responsive, it does not harm the crops below the system.”
The pilot will install “relatively small” greenhouses in universities and research institutes in Germany, Austria, Greece, and Israel. It will also test the tracking system at two operational farms in Germany and Italy. The exact sizes of the installations are still being planned.
The Regace project will use carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment methods to increase crop yield, including bottled CO2 enrichment, CO2 enrichment using CO2 bags, and using agricultural offcuts, compost, or manure to increase CO2 levels inside the greenhouse.
The consortium includes 12 research institutes and commercial organisations from five different countries: Fattoria Sociali del Circeo, Humboldt University of Berlin, Tel Aviv University, University of Rome Tor Vergata, University of Thessaly, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, BIO-Gärtnerei Watzkendorf, and Interteam. The project is supported by a €5.5 million ($5.89 million) grant from the European Union through the Horizon Europe Research and Innovation funding program.
