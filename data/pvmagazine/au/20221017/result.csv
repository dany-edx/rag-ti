AEMO said the connection simulation tool provides a cloud-based environment for users, including developers of energy projects including large-scale solar and storage facilities, to run studies against AEMO’s model which would help to integrate and fast-track renewable energy into the energy system.
Developers of large-scale renewable energy projects in Australia are currently required to submit to AEMO for testing models outlining what impact a proposed project will have on the grid. If that modelling is delayed or denied, the developer is required to ‘tune’ their model which can be a costly and slow process.
AEMO said the connection simulation tool will allow project developers and their partners and electricity networks to rapidly test and refine their renewable energy plant and project configurations using the same detailed wide-area power system simulations being used by the market operator to assess connections applications, while preserving the confidentiality of their model data.
“In a world-first, we are enabling project developers to have open access to test their connection directly against AEMO’s power system model through a secure gateway,” AEMO chief executive officer Daniel Westerman said.
“This will allow developers to simulate their connection, interrogate the technical outputs and iron out any bugs quickly and directly. Connections have been a teething issue in recent years, but now this is an area where Australia is absolutely leading the world.”

Merryn York, AEMO’s executive general manager of system design, said the innovative resource will support Australia’s energy transition, helping reduce risks, costs and time for connection approvals.
“In the next decade, Australia will experience our first cluster of coal-generation retirements, equal to approximately 14% of the NEM’s total capacity, which will challenge electricity reliability and power system security,” she said.
“Replacing coal with low-cost renewables, supported by firmed generation and the timely investment in transmission, is needed to provide reliable, secure and affordable energy for all Australians.
“The connections simulation tool will contribute by helping reduce risks, costs and time to approve the connection of new generation and storage projects, critical to replace retiring coal generation.”
The testing of the working prototype included generation developers, power system engineering consultants and energy equipment manufacturers to test the end-to-end user experience, including portal access, features and navigation, and running project modelling studies.
AEMO said the connection simulation tool is a critical foundational operating platform to achieve the market operator’s overall objective to efficiently manage a large number of grid connection applications from renewable energy developers.

In the past year, AEMO has registered 29 new generation and storage projects totalling 4 GW of capacity, an increase of 1 GW from last year and 2 GW from the 2020-21 financial year.
This included Australia’s largest battery (Victorian Big Battery, 300 MW), largest solar farm (Western Downs Green Power Hub, 400 MW) and largest wind farm (Stockyard Hill, 511 MW).
“In addition to the growth in the number of new projects and generation capacity, Australia is also breaking new ground with designing, testing and connecting new technologies, such as grid-forming batteries that provide inertia services,” York said.
The overall number of projects undergoing AEMO connection assessment across the NEM now remains high, with 149 projects with a combined total of 22.3 GW in the pipeline.
Partly funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) Advancing Renewables Program, the connections tool is one of AEMO’s initiatives to streamline the connection process and experience for participants.
Other projects include the Connection Reform Initiative, a partnership with the Clean Energy Council (CEC) to remove delays and deal with the increasing complexity in connecting projects to the NEM.

The project is the first residential installation of the company’s transparent solar glass technology, which is designed to preserve glass transparency while generating electricity.
ClearVue’s head of investor relations Earle Harper said it will serve as a pivotal reference site for future residential and skylight projects, as well as applications both locally and globally.
“This sale represents the first use of the ClearVue product in a luxury residential project where the ClearVue product is being used in a skylighting application,” he said.
“The sale, while a sizeable order for a single residence project, more importantly, demonstrates the flexibility of the ClearVue PV glazing product across market categories and segments.
“It will provide yet another reference site for the company to demonstrate the skylight and residential market applicability for the product.”

ClearVue has previously deployed its solar glass products in various projects across the Asia-Pacific region including a park in Sydney, a shopping centre in Perth and greenhouses in Japan and Perth. The company has also conducted trials in multiple geographies to explore the energy efficiency and power performance of its products.
The Griffith project, which will include the installation of eight ClearVue solar PV powered skylights measuring 1.4 metres x 0.78 metres, is the company’s first foray into what it said is a particularly attractive market.
The skylight market is expected to grow to about $8.8 billion (USD 5.5 billion) by 2030, with a compound annualised growth rate of 15.3% from 2021 to 2030.
“Importantly, it’s a simpler sale for the company to support its commercialisation journey to sales of commercial building facade sales,” Harper said.
ClearVue said it has been actively promoting its products in the context of skylights and roof windows and is engaged in discussions with potential licensees in several jurisdictions for the right to manufacture and distribute its product for this specific application.
Work on the Griffith project has commenced and is anticipated to be completed by the end of February 2023.
The luxury home, designed by Hugh Gordon Architect, is being built by developer Custom Apartments in conjunction with specialist builders Elm Building Group.
Custom Apartments said it expects this will be the first of many times it utilises ClearVue’s solar glass technology in its projects.
“We at Custom Apartments strive to deliver the best customer experience in terms of liveability, leading technology and sustainability in all of our projects,” the company said. “We are looking forward to being able to specify the product into upcoming residential apartment projects that will benefit from the ClearVue products’ energy efficiency and energy generation aspects.”

The project will see UNSW researchers partner with Australia’s only panel manufacturer, South Australia’s Tindo Solar, to develop the commercial product line for both farm crops and greenhouses. Input from Australian farmers and the nation’s science agency, the CSIRO, will also play a vital role, says associate professor and lead of the AC/DC Research Group at UNSW, Ziv Hameiri.
The concept is to sit silicon PV cells within a transparent or semi-transparent material embedded with specially tuned nanoparticles which allow parts of the light spectrum important for crops to pass through, while other parts of the light spectrum will be shifted to hit the backside of bifacial modules, increasing the total energy yield.

The aim is to not only boost energy yields though, Hameiri says, but to benefit crops by providing protection from extreme weather, including storms and Australia’s scorching midday sun, and also by improving water management. “You create a micro environment,” Hameiri says, since below the modules there tends to be higher humidity and cooler temperatures.
Beyond that, the researcher emphasised the project’s potential to bring two crucial industries to the table, and hopefully to find a solution that benefits both. 
In Australia, much like in Hameiri’s home country of Israel, tensions between farmers and the renewable energy industry have been growing as solar and wind developers encroach on arable land. 
“Climate change will create so many challenges and if we can find solutions that bridge people, bridge between point of views, and bring everyone to be onside because we need energy and we need food. 
“If we can bring everyone on the same side then we can free our attention to the more important issue and that’s climate change,” Hameiri says.
The idea is to create a product line so the ‘either/or’ mindset between farming and renewable energy can be reconfigured as a ‘both/and’ scenario.

Adding to that is the prospect of providing another income to farmers without changing how they use the land.
Excitingly for Hameiri, the project entails speaking to a new side of the market – opening up communication channels with farmers, solar researchers and manufacturers.
“There is a massive demand for an unshaded AgriPV solar panel, not only in Australia but all over the world,” Hameiri adds.
To date, the majority of agrivoltaic projects have paired solar with grazing – some highly effectively.

The semi-transparent module concept is an alternative to the traditional agrivoltaic configuration where cells sit in glass. In Europe and Japan, where agrivoltaics for cropping applications is more common, the projects tend to be arranged so there is enough space between the modules to let light hit the crops, known as ‘shaded’ agrivoltaics.
Compared to this traditional configuration, the initial demonstration of the UNSW concept was able to boost the total energy yield by as much as 20%. 
Most of that gain, Hameiri says, was because of the increase in current, noting the promising results are from initial tests only in a configuration yet to be optimised.

Through the Tindo partnership, Hameiri and his team are hoping to create a commercial line of module options where nanoparticles have been tuned to the specific light spectrums different crops thrive in.
“The concept is to have one or two or three types of modules,” Hameiri said. Obviously, from a manufacturing perspective a ‘one size fits all’ solution would be easier, but Hameiri says the project requires more than PV yield be considered.
The challenge is to figure out precisely what crops not only grow best but make the best produce under which light conditions – information Hameiri says the agriculture department at the CSIRO has long investigated.

The team is hoping to learn from the CSIRO’s studies and adjust the nanoparticles accordingly. “We make sure the spectrum is optimal for the specific crop,” Hameiri says.
The researcher plans to start by looking at crops such as berries, which have among the highest profitability and don’t require a day of full sun. If that approach proves successful, the vision is to begin considering other crop variations.
Hameiri notes it will be crucial to consider how the land is farmed in terms of equipment so the modules and agrivoltaic projects can best integrate.

The announcement, part of Uber’s commitment to become a zero-emission platform by 2040, comes amid record-breaking sales for EVs in Australia despite ongoing supply constraints.
Recent sales figures from the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI) show more than 7,200 EVs were sold in September, outnumbering sales of all hybrid vehicles. Australians have purchased more than 21,700 EVs in 2022 but the FCAI warned logistical and supply chain issues remain problematic.
Uber Australia and New Zealand general manager Dom Taylor said that with electric cars in short supply in Australia, the deal with Splend will make it easier for rideshare drivers to make the switch to EVs.
“We know there are many barriers for Australians when it comes to driving an electric vehicle, not the least being limited supply and the cost of the car itself,” he said. “With this partnership, we are building new pathways and making it easier than ever for more driver partners to go electric.”
The deal will see 500 Polestar 2 vehicles, which retail for $66,940 on road, offered to Uber drivers in NSW through Splend’s rent-to-own financing. Uber will halve its service fees up to $6,000 annually for drivers who take up EVs, and Splend will offer discounted weekly payments and home-charging solutions.
The majority of the EVs are expected to be delivered before year’s end with the remainder arriving in early 2023.
NSW Treasurer Matt Kean said the partnership between Uber and Splend, which received $1.8 million in funding from the NSW government’s Drive Electric initiative in July, was encouraging and could bring “more EVs to city streets, and faster”.
“Australia’s transition to electric vehicles is a priority at all levels of government, and we’re encouraged to see this kind of collaboration in the private sector,” he said.

The Waratah Super Battery, launched in February after Origin Energy announced it would accelerate the closure of the 2,880 MW Eraring coal-fired power station, is slated to be the largest standby network battery in the Southern Hemisphere.
The battery is designed to provide reserve transmission capacity and stability, rather than additional electricity storage capacity. It is intended to allow consumers in the state’s main load centres access to more energy from existing electricity generators while maintaining network security.
Energy Minister Matt Kean said the Waratah Super Battery will act as a “shock absorber” for the electricity grid so that transmission capacity currently stored in reserve can be freed up to transfer energy to consumers.
“The Waratah Super Battery will be the biggest network battery anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere, providing at least 700 MW of standby network capacity to the grid,” he said.
“The battery will ensure electricity consumers in Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong have access to more energy from existing generators while new transmission connections are developed.”

The state government, through the Energy Corporation of NSW (EnergyCo) has appointed Transgrid as the network operator for the project and has directed the company to carry it out as a Priority Transmission Infrastructure Project.
Transgrid will coordinate the delivery of the various project components, including the connection of the battery to the grid, and the design and installation of a $30 million control system to trigger the battery into operation when additional energy is required.
Transgrid chief executive officer Brett Redman said the battery will be connected to the grid via the firm’s existing Munmorah substation.
“As part of the project we will carry out $150 million in upgrades to existing transmission lines and substations to enable additional energy generated in regional NSW to be delivered to consumers,” he said.
“Transgrid will also develop, install and operate a $30 million System Integrity Protection Scheme (SIPS) to monitor the network for disruptions, trigger the super battery into action when required, and dial down energy elsewhere in the grid to balance supply.
“We are fully committed to ensuring a more reliable, affordable and sustainable energy supply for Australians as we work with government to accelerate the transition to a clean energy future.”

The project has been declared Critical State Significant Infrastructure by the NSW government while the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has identified the project as an “actionable NSW project”, which means it considers the project’s development should commence as soon as possible.
EnergyCo said construction of the Waratah Super Battery is expected to begin in early 2023, pending approval, and to be completed by mid-2025 in advance of Eraring’s earliest closure date.
An expression of interest process conducted earlier this year attracted strong interest from potential suppliers of the big battery system with more than 30 local and international bidders vying to build the battery.
EnergyCo is expected to finalise a competitive tender process to identify suitable battery developers by the end of the year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/17/wind-solar-payback-times-under-a-year-in-some-parts-of-world-says-rystad/,"FINANCE,EUROPE,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"OCTOBER 17, 2022","Wind, solar payback times under a year in some parts of world, says Rystad","From pv magazine Global
The record-breaking run in power prices, particularly in Europe, is creating a favorable investment case for solar and wind projects, making it increasingly compelling to develop renewable assets purely based on project economics.
According to Norwegian consultancy Rystad Energy, current spot prices in Germany, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom would all result in payback of 12 months or less. Considering the average monthly spot prices for August in these countries were all well over €400/MWh and the relatively low operating costs of renewables, investing in utility-scale projects appear to be a no-brainer.
For instance, for a generic 250 MW solar project, assuming a long-term electricity price of €50/MWh (USD 49/MWh), the expected post tax return is approximately 6% with a payback period of 11 years, Rystad calculates. A price of €350/MWh or above results in a payback period of only one year while a price of approximately €180 – the European Commission’s proposed price threshold – halves the payback to five to six years.

Investors are seeing the opportunity. According to Rystad, capital investments in renewables have increased significantly and are set to reach USD 494 billion in 2022, outstripping upstream oil and gas at USD 446 billion for the year.
“Capital investments in renewables are set to outstrip oil and gas for the first time this year as countries scramble to source secure and affordable energy,” says Michael Sarich, senior vice president, Rystad Energy. “Investments into renewables are likely to increase further moving forward as renewable project payback times shorten to less than a year in some cases.”
Rise of storage
High energy prices but also newly adopted climate legislation, including the US inflation Reduction Act and European Union’s REPowerEU plan, are expected to give a big boost to the global energy storage market.
In its latest forecast, BloombergNEF says that energy storage installations around the world are projected to reach a cumulative 411 GW/1,194 GWh by 2030. That is 15 times the 27 GW/56 GWh of storage that was online at the end of 2021.
Driven by recent policy developments, BNEF has revised its previous estimates up by 13% from the ones presented in its 2H 2022 Energy Storage Market Outlook. This is equal to an extra 46 GW/145 GWh. While an estimated 387 GW/1,143 GWh will be added from 2022 to 2030, supply chain constraints will cloud deployment expectations until 2024, says BNEF.

The United States and China are set to remain the two largest markets, representing more than half of global storage installations by the end of the decade. Europe, however, is catching up with a significant ramp-up in capacity, driven by the current energy crisis.
BNEF’s forecast suggests that the majority of energy storage build by 2030, equivalent to 61% of megawatts, will be to provide energy shifting – that is, advancing or delaying the time of electricity dispatch. Co-located renewables-plus-storage projects, in particular solar-plus-storage, are becoming commonplace throughout the world, notes BNEF.
