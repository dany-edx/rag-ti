NSW Planning Minister Rob Stokes said approval had been granted for the project’s western section, a 900-kilometre transmission line that would stretch from Wagga Wagga to Robertstown in SA, with a spur line to Victoria.
“Today’s approval is a major step towards facilitating the delivery of what would be the largest energy transmission project undertaken in Australia in more than 30 years,” Stokes said.
“The first stage will run from the Buronga substation to the Victorian border and create 600 construction jobs and inject $418 million into our regional economy.
“To get to a low-emissions energy system our nation needs robust and reliable transmission infrastructure and that’s why we declared EnergyConnect Critical State Significant Infrastructure in 2019 because it will be a fundamental part of Australia’s energy future.
Transgrid will contribute $1.8 billion towards the project costs while SA network owner ElectraNet will make a $457.4 million contribution to build the transmission line on the SA side of the border.
Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) will also spend almost $300 million on the project, which was given the green light by the Australian Energy Regulator on May 31.
Transgrid acting CEO Brian Salter said EnergyConnect is a transformational project which will help accelerate Australia’s energy transition by connecting customers with more renewable generation.
“The interconnector is one of the largest projects ever proposed in the National Electricity Market (NEM) and it will facilitate Australia’s energy transition, bringing a reduction in carbon emissions and helping the nation meet its climate change targets,” he said.
“The project will be the critical missing link in the NEM, connecting more renewable generation and reinforcing connectivity between the state grids of NSW, South Australia and Victoria.”

Stage one of the project, which includes works between the NSW/SA border near Renmark Rd, TransGrid’s existing substation at Buronga, and the NSW/Victorian border near Monak, will now be referred to the federal government for approval with construction expected to begin next year.
Stage two will involve the development of the 540km eastern section between Buronga and Wagga Wagga and will be subject to a separate development application. Transgrid is preparing a separate environmental impact statement for works between Buronga and Wagga Wagga.
The project is expected to be fully operational by 2024.
NSW Energy Minister Matt Kean said the project will accelerate progress under the NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap and help the state achieve a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030.
“The Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap is our plan to replace our ageing electricity infrastructure and secure NSW’s future as a clean energy superpower,” he said.
“This approval will help to unlock transmission constraints in southern NSW and help to open up the South-West Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).
“The South-West Renewable Energy Zone will drive jobs and investment into regional NSW, and help to provide our households and businesses with some of the cheapest, cleanest electricity anywhere in the world.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/30/nem-in-for-shake-up-with-five-minute-settlement-to-start/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 30, 2021",NEM in for shake-up with five-minute settlement to start,"From 1 October 2021, the electricity spot price in Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) will switch from 30-minute settlements averaged over six, five-minute dispatch prices to five-minute-settlements (5MS) with each five-minute interval settled against its own dispatch price.
Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) chief executive Daniel Westerman said the change will bring the settlement period into line with the dispatch process by which generators are scheduled and which has operated on a five-minute basis since the start of the NEM in 1988.
The 5MS, first approved by the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) in 2017, with AEMO responsible for updating market procedures, designing and testing systems, and coordinating an industry readiness program, is expected to improve price signals and reward demand-response providers and fast-response technologies, such as battery storage.
The reform involves changes to metering, settlement and prudentials, and bidding processes, as well as electricity retail and wholesale market systems.
Critics have suggested 5MS will introduce added uncertainty to the NEM but Westerman said the reform would improve market efficiency, enhance competition and deliver consumer benefits.
“As one of the most significant reforms since the NEM’s inception in 1998, 5MS provides better price signal for investment in fast response and flexible technologies, such as batteries and gas-peaking generation,” he said.
“Over time, improved price signals should lead to more efficient decisions by generators lowering wholesale costs which make up around one third of a typical bill.”
The 5MS reform was scheduled to come into force by 1 July 2021, but was delayed as energy regulators opted to focus on energy security measures, and to reduce the introduction of new regulatory measures, during the disruption caused by Covid-19.
As well as the 5MS reform, a new market participant category – the Wholesale Demand Response (WDR) provider – will also be introduced by AEMO this month to coordinate and offer ‘demand response’ into the NEM.
Westerman said the WDR reform, to come into effect from 24 October 2021, will enable large commercial and industrial businesses to bid and schedule a reduction in electricity consumption for payment.
“AEMO will operate a new market for large energy users to commit to lowering usage to help the power system security and reliability, including peak demand days and periods of high wholesale electricity prices, increasing competition with potential flow-on price benefits to consumers,” he said.
AEMO will also in October begin reporting on unaccounted for energy (UFE) values as part of the “soft start” of Global Settlement (GS), a framework for the settlement of the wholesale electricity market.
The GS changes are scheduled to be implement in full on 1 May 2022.
Also included in the reforms package is a two-day retail switching. Starting in October, the time taken for consumers to change electricity retailers will reduce from up to three months to two-day transfers.
“Faster switching between energy retailers removes a frustration, enabling customers to transition to better electricity offers, access new services and provide retailers with a more streamlined process,” Westerman said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/30/iberdrola-adds-190-mw-avonlie-solar-farm-to-australian-portfolio/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 30, 2021",Iberdrola adds 190 MW Avonlie Solar Farm to Australian portfolio,"Iberdrola has committed to building its first standalone solar PV farm in Australia after purchasing the Avonlie Solar Farm project near Narrandera, in the Riverina region of southern New South Wales (NSW).
Construction on the project, which received planning consent from the state government in 2019, is expected to begin later this year with initial energisation expected before the end of 2022.
When operational, more than 450,000 solar modules mounted on single axis tracking systems will generate approximately 500 GWh of electricity annually, equivalent to powering more than 80,000 Australian households and avoiding over 157,000 tonnes of carbon emissions per year.
Iberdrola Australia managing director Ross Rolfe said the acquisition of the Avonlie Solar Farm is a part of the company’s strategy for the region with Australia identified as a priority market for the Spanish energy utility.
Iberdrola, which acquired Infigen Energy in 2020, has established itself as a major player in Australia’s renewable energy market with more than 800 MW operating capacity, 453 MW under construction and a development pipeline of over 1 GW.
Much of its focus has been on wind energy with seven operational wind farms totalling over 670 MW but there has been a shift towards solar and energy storage.
Earlier this month Iberdrola installed the final wind turbine at the almost 320 MW Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park (PAREP) in South Australia. The $500 million project, which combines 207 MW of wind and 110 MW of solar is the first hybrid solar+wind power plant undertaken by Iberdrola.
It has also entered into a user agreement with TransGrid in relation to the 50 MW/75 MWh Wallgrove Grid Battery in NSW.

“We are seeing a rapidly growing number of commercial and industrial customers adopting net zero targets and transitioning to 100% renewable electricity contracts,” Rolfe said.
“At Iberdrola Australia we invest not only in low-cost renewables, like the Avonlie Solar Farm, but also flexible, fast-start firming capacity, ensuring the electricity system remains reliable as renewable penetration grows.
“This optimised portfolio enables us to provide our growing customer base with long-term electricity contracts that are at once reliable, affordable and clean.”
The Avonlie Solar Farm is the largest solar project developed by RES which recently sold the 180 MW Dulacca Wind Farm in Queensland to Octopus Energy after securing a PPA with publicly owned energy generator CleanCo.
RES chief executive Matt Rebbeck said the company has a development portfolio of more than 4.7 GW in Australia and an asset management portfolio of over 1.2 GW.
“Having delivered multiple large-scale renewable energy projects in Australia, with over 1.21 GW of projects now in construction or operational, RES is delighted to progress another project in NSW,” he said.
“The Avonlie Solar Farm will create more than 230 full time local jobs during construction and provide significant regional benefits and deliver on our vision of a future where everyone has access to affordable zero carbon energy”.
The project will directly connect to a dual 132 kV grid connection which passes through the project site about 20 kilometres south of Narrandera.
Lumea will deliver the grid connection services for the life of the project.

China-based inverter manufacturer APsystems has unveiled a single-phase microinverter for both residential and commercial PV projects, which it claims is the most powerful dual-module microinverter in the world.
Based on an entirely new architecture, the DS3 inverter is available in three versions with power outputs of 730, 880, and 960 VA. “The DS3 series is designed to be paired with virtually any choice of PV module type and size, including 60 and 72-cell modules, 120 and 144-split-cell modules, as well as bifacial modules,” the manufacturer said in a statement.
The device has a size of 262x218x41.2mm and a weight of 2.6kg. It features an efficiency of 97% and a California Energy Commission (CEC) efficiency of 96.5%.
The new product relies on two input channels with independent MPPT and its nominal MPPT efficiency is 99.5%. It also features standard MC4 connectors with an IP67 enclosure rating.
“The inverter is built with 20% fewer components and offers reduced logistics costs, faster installation, improved communication, and connection features,” APsystems stated, noting that the device is also compatible with its QS1 and YC600 microinverters, as well as ECU-R, ECU-C and ECU-B gateway devices.
The inverter will be sold starting from the fourth quarter of this year and is being showcased at Solar Solutions International, which is currently being held in Amsterdam, in the Netherlands.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/30/china-develops-tech-which-claims-to-detect-module-faults-in-all-weather-and-lights/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 30, 2021",China develops tech to detect module faults in all weather and lights,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists at the Nanjing University of Science and Technology, in China, have developed a PV panel defect detection system that is claimed to work under any lighting conditions and in all weather.
Described in the paper Defect detection system for silicon solar panels under all-day irradiation, which was recently published in Applied Optics, the novel technique consists of combining software that applies a modulated electric current to the PV panels and an indium-gallium-arsenide (InGaAs) photodiode detector that takes a sequence of images of the panels.
“Today’s defect detection systems can only be used to find defects at night or on solar panel modules that have been removed and moved inside or into a shaded environment,” researcher Yunsheng Qian stated.
Furthermore, the system includes a filter that is able to limit the detected wavelengths detected to around 1,150nm and to remove some of the stray sunlight from the images. “Using these image data as data sources, a defect display algorithm model is designed,” the researchers explained.
“The very fast imaging speed allows more images to be collected so that a greater number of changes between images can be distinguished,” said Sheng Wu, the paper’s main author. “The key development was a new algorithm that distinguishes the modulated and unmodulated parts of the image sequence and then magnifies this difference.”
The technique was tested on several mono and polycrystalline panels and the Chinese group claims it was able to detect faults on modules with irradiances from 0 to 1,300 W/m2, which it said equates to light conditions ranging from complete darkness to full sunlight. “The results show that this algorithm can reduce background interference in an effective way and improve the contrast of defects displayed under high irradiance.”
Looking forward, the research team is planning to develop software to reduce digital noise and improve image quality, so that the detector can collect image changes more accurately. The academics also want to see if artificial intelligence could be applied to the acquired images to automatically identify the types of defects, and further streamline the inspection process.
