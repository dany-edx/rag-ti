Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the grid-connected battery is an important and innovative addition to the electricity grid in Central Queensland and would assist in gaining the maximum advantage from Queensland’s abundant rooftop solar systems.
“We know there’s been a huge uptake in rooftop solar energy in Yeppoon and Rockhampton and this investment will drive even more,” he said.
“It means renewable energy made during Central Queensland’s many sunny days can be stored to use during peak demand periods in the evening.
“It will help deliver cheaper, cleaner energy for homes and businesses, and capacity for even more renewables in Central Queensland.”
Queensland has one of the highest rates of household rooftop solar installations in Australia, with one in three homes using solar. Collectively, the energy produced by Queensland rooftops is already the largest renewable generator in the state and renewables make up approximately 20% of Queensland’s energy mix. But that figure will need to more than double over the next decade if the state is to achieve it 50% renewable energy target by 2030.
Energy Queensland CEO Rod Duke said the Tanby battery is among an initial six large-scale batteries to be rolled out as part of the utility’s Local Network Battery Plan announced following the explosion of the Callide coal generator last year.
The strategy will eventually see at least 15 network-connected batteries installed across the state, allowing for better management of the increasing levels of renewable energy being generated.
“Having more storage capacity will enable us to move electricity in both space and time and that will lead to greater network stability and reliability for customers,” he said.
Duke said the initial six 4 MW/8 MWh batteries are now largely completed.
“We now have 8 MWh batteries at Bohle Plains and Black River near Townsville, Kleinton near Toowoomba, Bargara near Bundaberg, Tanby near Rockhampton, and at Torquay near Hervey Bay,” he said. “We are close to having all of these batteries constructed, commissioned and operating on the network.”
Duke said the remaining nine batteries will be spread across major centres in regional Queensland near communities that have significant rooftop solar generation “because we know that’s where they will have the greatest overall benefit”.
“The network of the future will not only need to move electricity from where it is generated to where it’s used, but also from the time it is made to when it’s consumed,” he said. “Having more storage capacity will lead to greater network stability and reliability for customers.”

TAC chairman David Fallu said as the largest energy user in New South Wales (NSW), the company has a pivotal role to play in shaping future renewable energy investment in the state.
“TAC is well placed to collaborate with industry to lower the risk profile of delivering significant, commercially viable renewable energy projects in addition to supporting network stability through the energy transition,” he said.
“This is a significant opportunity for TAC to collaborate and drive investment in competitive firmed renewable energy sources.”
The Tomago aluminium smelter near Newcastle on the NSW Central Coast is the biggest electricity user in the state, consuming more than 10% of its electricity. The company last year announced plans to transition to 100% renewable energy after its contract with coal power-dominated AGL expires at the end of 2028.
TAC said on Monday it is seeking expressions of interest (EOI) from outside parties to develop, invest in or procure renewable energy and dispatchable firm power generation projects or contracts. The company said the projects would be used to supply its production assets and underpin its decarbonisation strategy and net-zero ambition.
“TAC’s owners are committed to transitioning the business to a low-carbon future, and this is a key step towards reaching that very important goal,” Fallu said.
The company said the EOI process will seek to deliver flexibility in relation to energy supply, participation models and the ability for TAC to leverage its competitive advantage using its site footprint, infrastructure, and load requirements.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/26/new-zealand-fast-tracks-approvals-process-for-147-mw-solar-farm/,"INSTALLATIONS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEW ZEALAND",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 26, 2022",New Zealand fast tracks approvals process for 147 MW solar farm,"The New Zealand arm of UK-based renewables developer Harmony Energy has received a permit from New Zealand’s Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) to build the 147 MW Tauhei Solar Farm in the Waikato region of the North Island.
The EPA said an independent fast-track consenting panel has granted resource consent to build the Tauhei Solar Farm on farmland at Te Aroha West, about 140 kilometres south of Auckland.
The panel has also approved the installation of underground electricity cables to connect the project to the national grid via the existing Waihou Substation. The consent also allows for the construction of two new substations, inverters, ancillary buildings, structures, and other associated infrastructure.
The proposed Tauhei Solar Farm will comprise about 330,000 panels spread across approximately 180 hectares of existing farmland. The project will be capable of generating enough renewable electricity to supply the equivalent of 33,000 homes.
It is anticipated construction will commence in 2024, with the solar farm to be operational in 2025.
The EPA said the resource consent was granted by an independent panel under the government’s Fast-track Consenting Act. The legislation, introduced to grow the economy, boost jobs and speed up infrastructure development, allows for a shorter consenting process, saving an average of 15 months per project.

Harmony Energy director Pete Grogan welcomed the decision, saying the project will provide a significant contribution to New Zealand’s net zero ambition while delivering significant economic and environmental benefits.
“We are thrilled this important renewable development can now proceed,” he said. “This proposal creates opportunities for local businesses and employment and creates significant biodiversity gains.
“One of the great advantages of solar power is that it accommodates dual use of land, allowing for energy generation alongside continued farming production, as will happen at Tauhei.”
While the design of the solar farm allows for the grazing of sheep between and under the panel arrays, it also includes the ecological restoration of approximately seven hectares of wetland area, incorporating boardwalks for scheduled educational visits.
Grogan, who co-founded Harmony Energy before returning home to establish the company’s New Zealand operation, said in addition to the Tauhei Solar Farm, the company has a pipeline of more than 500 MW of renewable energy projects planned for New Zealand.
In the UK, the company is in the final stages of developing a major battery energy storage facility in East Yorkshire. When finished, the facility will have the capacity to store up to 198 MWh of power to feed directly back into the network, making it the largest battery energy storage facility in the UK.
The Tauhei Solar Farm is the latest in a suite of large-scale solar PV projects planned for New Zealand.
Wellington-based Todd Generation, through subsidiary Nova Energy, is pursuing plans to establish a 400 MW solar farm at Rangitāiki on the North Island. New Zealand’s Contact Energy has teamed with Lightsource bp, the renewables arm of Britain-based BP, to develop a large-scale solar portfolio, German investment manager Aquila Capital has partnered with Auckland-based renewables developer Far North Solar Farm (FNSF) to develop a suite of large-scale solar PV projects across the North and South islands and Helios Energy is also pursuing grid-scale solar developments in the country.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/26/oz-minerals-moves-on-plans-for-worlds-largest-off-grid-hybrid-project/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MICROGRID,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 26, 2022",Oz Minerals moves on plans for ‘world’s largest’ off-grid hybrid project,"ASX-listed miner Oz Minerals confirmed it will initially source 80% of the energy needs for its West Musgrave Project through an off-grid hybrid renewable power solution after announcing it had given its final investment approval to develop the massive copper-nickel project in Western Australia (WA).
Oz Minerals said ~80% of the energy needs for the copper and nickel mine being developed in WA’s east, near the South Australian and Northern Territory borders is to be delivered via an optimised mix of solar PV and wind generation, supported by a battery energy storage system. This will be backed up by diesel-fuelled generation.
While no specifics about the size of the individual elements of the system were made available, Oz Minerals said the renewable power solution would have a nominal 50 MW base case power supply with room for expansion.
“Once complete, it will be one of the world’s largest, off-grid hybrid projects,” the miner said.
The renewables-based power solution is to be delivered via a power purchase agreement with an independent power producer and Oz Minerals chief executive officer Andrew Cole said the agreement includes provision for expansion with the company committed to developing a roadmap to 100% renewable generation.
“In addition to the ~80% renewable energy sourced from wind and solar for power generation, the project scope includes a pathway to net zero scope 1 emissions by 2038,” he said. “The pathway is aligned with the potential transition to an electric haulage fleet at the first engine change out, together with exploring other initiatives to reduce diesel and the application of offsets.”

Oz Minerals plans to start production at the West Musgrave site in late 2025 when it predicts the nickel market – which has been buoyed by demand for battery metals needed for decarbonisation and electrification – will enter a sustained period of undersupply.
“No other metals will have the same intensity of use as the world shifts to cleaner energy and electrification, electric vehicles, wind farms and solar panels,” Cole said.
West Musgrave is expected to produce an average of 35,000 tonnes of nickel in concentrate and 41,000 tonnes of copper in concentrate in each of its first five years, with production of 27,000 tonnes of nickel and 33,000 tonnes per annum over its 24-year mine life.
Oz Minerals chair Rebecca McGrath said global electrification is set to drive significant demand for these core metals.
“The board’s approval of West Musgrave is a fundamental step towards realising Oz Minerals’ strategy to evolve into a modern minerals producer set to supply global copper and nickel markets as the world moves into the de-carbonisation and electrification era,” she said. “We can see the enormous potential of this project.”

As well as producing both nickel and copper concentrate, Oz Minerals is also working on plans to add value by processing minerals on site.
“We also have a study underway into downstream nickel processing via mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP) to further process the concentrate, increase product grade, reduce volume for transport and add further value to the project,” Cole said.
The Adelaide-based miner is also looking at partnering with electric vehicle and battery makers which are no longer content with offtake agreements, preferring to lock in supply through part ownership of mines.
“We are also considering the option to selldown a minority interest in the project to a strategic partner building on the significant in-bound interest we have received over the past six months,” Cole said.
The West Musgrave mine will add to the gold copper mines Oz Minerals has in South Australia at Prominent Hill and Carapateena and its Santa Lucia gold copper mine in Brazil.

The kit is intended to be deployed on a vehicle’s roof and supply the vehicle’s traction battery directly.
“According to our calculations, such a kit could increase the range of the demonstrator vehicle by 800 km per year and reduce the frequency of recharging by 14%, which is not to be underestimated for many uses,” the scientists said. “By way of illustration – in France and according to the 2019 Personal Mobility Survey of the Ministry of Ecological Transition and Territorial Cohesion – 35.7% of home-to-work journeys are less than 5 km away.”
The prototype kit consists of a 145 W photovoltaic panel, a magnetic rear panel and an MPPT charge controller. It also includes a battery and a micro-inverter that can now be used to inject the stored energy into the grid when the vehicle is recharged.
“Tested on a Renault Zoé model, the remote data feedback shows the possible gain up to 4 kilometres per day when the days are very sunny,” the research institute said.
Liten expects to develop the VIPV technology with the support of unspecified relevant manufacturers.
“At this stage of development, the kit does not allow the main battery to be powered directly, which is its ultimate objective,” it stated. “The system is non-intrusive to the vehicle so it can be adapted to all rechargeable models.”

The Abu Dhabi-based organisation has updated the analysis it produced in 2016 about the 10 countries that make up the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to map a route to net zero in the region by mid century.
The authors of the report – jointly written by inter-governmental regional body the ASEAN Centre for Energy – concluded solar will become the dominant force among new power generation capacity by mid century, even in the most pessimistic business-as-usual scenario, which presumes backsliding in environmental ambitions.
In terms of the energy transition required to prevent catastrophic climate change, the study says ASEAN nations must have installed 241 GW of solar generation capacity this decade, at a cost of $156 billion, and can then spend $1.08 trillion to reach 2.1 TW of solar in a 90%-renewables energy system by 2050, or $1.25 trillion for 2.4 TW across the 10 countries for an all-clean-power grid.
When it comes to adding in the grid upgrades, energy storage facilities and electric vehicles (EVs) and chargers needed to back up such a solar revolution, IRENA said, $968 billion must be spent this decade, plus a further $8.77 trillion or $9.11 trillion, depending on whether the region retains a 10% fossil fuel contribution in its power mix – mostly from natural gas.
Factor in the entire cost of the regional energy transition, including other renewables, operations and maintenance expense, and a host of other investments, and the total bill for a 90% clean energy power mix in 2050 would come in at $28.1 trillion, with a renewables grid costing $29.4 trillion.
If those figures appear daunting, IRENA says its base case scenario – based on current energy plans in the region – tops out at $28.3 trillion in 28 years’ time.
That breaks down as a net-zero need to add 64 GW to 73 GW per year of new solar in Brunei, Myanmar, Cambodia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Indonesia would need to add 24.2 GW per year of PV, starting this year; Vietnam 17.9 GW; and Thailand 11.2 GW. At the other end of the scale, Brunei would have to contribute just 70 MW annually.
In cost terms, Vietnam offers the lowest levelised cost of energy from solar, at $0.046/kWh, with IRENA adding “most” other Asean nations have figures between $0.05/kWh and $0.075/kWh.
The archipelagic nature of the Philippines and Indonesia means mini-grids and standalone clean power kits will have to do some of the lifting, prompting a need for more legislation and incentives to drive their roll-out, the report added.
The 128-page study, published last week, estimated ASEAN nations will need about 11 million tons of green hydrogen by 2050, to be used in heavy industry, shipping fuels, and to balance out all that solar, along with grid scale batteries.
The region is lagging the sort of progress witnessed in other parts of the world when it comes to hydrogen strategies, according to the report, and what progress there has been is focused on exporting the energy carrier to big regional neighbours such as Japan and South Korea, which have not placed sufficient emphasis on green hydrogen.
Producing blue or even, fossil-fuel grey hydrogen for those nations could lock ASEAN nations out of the global market, warned the report’s authors, given the stress being placed on green hydrogen production in the strategies of Australia and the Gulf States.
Another potential energy transition opportunity for ASEAN nations lies in exploitation of the raw materials critical to renewables and EVs.
Indonesia is a big supplier of the world’s nickel and copper and the Philippines also has a big slice of both markets. Vietnam, Malaysia, and Myanmar have substantial rare earth element deposits, the report noted.
Going it alone on any of those fronts would cripple the solar revolution required, according to the study’s authors, because ASEAN nations would have to co-ordinate regional interconnection and power supply deals to be able to support the vast number of solar panels that would be required to achieve a net-zero carbon energy mix.
