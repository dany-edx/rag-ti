“We think that’s probably the start of the building blocks that we need to go and target larger megawatt hour systems,” Redflow’s Managing Director and CEO, Tim Harris, told pv magazine Australia.
“It allows us to step into that higher voltage space that’s going to be necessary for large-scale industrial and commercial and potential utility elements, so that’s a major development for us.”
Redflow’s batteries are typically 48-volts, which has proven limiting for the company – especially for large-scale installations. The hope is that its Energy Pod will solve this. It integrates technology from a European power electronics company which is able to turn low-voltages to between 800 to 900 volts.
 
Each of the Energy Pod Z modules contains 160 kWh of energy storage and is able to push and pull energy at 60 kW, according to Redflow’s System Integration Architect, Simon Hackett. It was Hackett’s job to integrate the European technology with its Redflow battery pods, which he described as working “really well.”
“The point of doing that is when you want to deploy many megawatts of power when you don’t just have a few batteries – you want hundreds of batteries, ultimately thousands of batteries – you need to do that at high voltage,” Hackett said.
“This is the key for us. Once you have this thing in the field, you can essentially have as many as you like… once you run this sort of advanced high-voltage system, the sky’s the limit.”
The Energy Pod Z modules stem from Redflow’s $1.5 million deal to supply 192 zinc-bromine flow batteries to waste conversion company, Anaergia, at its Rialto Bioenergy Facility in southern California. Redflow designed to the pod to meet Anaergia’s requirement of 2 MWh of energy storage – which has in turn acted as a springboard for the company to launch into what Hackett calls its “high-voltage, high-capacity, grid-scale future.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/11/australias-only-solar-manufacturer-helps-students-construct-solar-race-car/,"COMMUNITY,HIGHLIGHTS,RESEARCH,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 11, 2021",Australia’s only solar manufacturer helps students construct solar race car,"In April, eight students from the Australian National University (ANU) spent a week in Adelaide with the engineers and technicians from Tindo Solar, Australia’s only solar panels manufacturer, to develop a race-worthy solar car.
Hardly a new partnership, Tindo Solar has been helping ANU students with solar cars since 2017.
“We can run simulations and modelling on our car, but when we visit Tindo we can determine which ideas will work,” technical Lead for ANU Solar Team, Alex Ambrosi, said. The placement of the car’s 256 solar cells and 21 modules in positions to gain the best exposure to the sun and optimum aerodynamics are among the most critical design elements.

Unfortunately, the race ANU’s Solar Team had hoped to race the car in, the biennial Bridgestone World Solar Challenge, has been changed to an online challenge in 2021 because of Covid-19. The ANU team has now decided it will stage its own solar car race its calling the Australian Solar Challenge, open to those willing to compete.
“We were disappointed that the World Solar Challenge was changed to an online event,” Ambrosi said. “So we are working with the other Australian teams to stage our own event later in the year, and we are working on a car to compete in that race.”
The previous ANU solar car that competed in the 2019 race produced around 1 kW of power that was stored in a 5 kWh battery, propelling the car to speeds between 60 and 85 km/h across the 3000 kilometres from Darwin to Adelaide.

Chief Executive Officer of Tindo Solar, Shayne Jaenisch, said the company had enthusiastically assisted the ANU Solar Racing Team to develop its cars, as well as the racing teams from TAFE SA and University of Adelaide. “We have the experts, the materials and the equipment to get the best out of a solar car. We also see an educational role for ourselves and our partnership with tertiary institutions allows us to fulfil that role.”
Just last week, Tindo Solar has unveiled its new generation 400 W module for domestic and export markets. The company is riding a wave of success that has delivered a 40% increase in retail orders and 70% rise in wholesale orders in the past 12 months.

Most notably, CEP.Energy have entered into an Engineering, Procurement and Construction arrangement with RACV Solar, the renewable energy arm of the roadside assistance club, to install a 2.62 MW solar installation and 10 MWh battery storage system worth $40 million at Narellan Town Centre mall in southwest Sydney.
Meanwhile, Vicinity Shopping Centres has managed to push its 2021 NABERS Sustainable Portfolios Index to 4.4 stars, up from 3.9 in 2019, across Australia’s largest rated retail portfolio. Its improved rating is largely thanks to its solar program that helped deliver 6 Star ratings in six of its centres in Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia. In December, Vicinity also announced it would install 1.6 MW of solar panels to shade the carpark of its mega Chadstone complex in Victoria.
Vicinity Centre
The state also recently became home to the certifiably most sustainable shopping centre in the world, Melbourne’s Burwood Brickworks which is part of Frasers Property’s portfolio. Burwood Brickwood extends the metrics of sustainability far beyond simply solar power and water efficiency, targeting the world’s most comprehensive list of criteria which rates everything from the toxicity and sources of construction materials to aesthetic beauty and happiness.
Australia’s largest privately-owned shopping centre, Narellan Town Centre in Sydney’s southwest, is undergoing a $40 million solar transformation, part of which will see partners CEP.Energy and RACV Solar deliver a 2.62 MW solar installation and 10MWh battery storage system, essentially creating a microgrid.
The installation is the RACV’s largest to date, with the project’s battery size is equivalent to 740 Tesla Home Batteries.
The system will not just target electricity cost reductions for landlords and tenants of the centre, but also aims to offer market services to support the grid.

Dart West Retail, owners of Narellan Town Centre, have entered into a 30 year agreement with CEP.Energy, which in February announced its intention to build Australia the world’s largest grid-scale battery in New South Wales – a 1.2 GW megabattery at Kurri Kurri in the Hunter Valley.
The massive plan came as a bit of a shock, especially since the company, which is chaired by former New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma, really only emerged last year. CEP.Energy has come in hot to say the least, declaring it wants to install gigawatts of solar and battery storage around Australia by 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/11/350000-solar-panels-installed-by-state-water-utility-marking-completion-of-mammoth-project/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE PV,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 11, 2021","350,000+ solar panels installed by state water utility, marking completion of mammoth project","SA Water, which serves millions of South Australians and is one of the state’s biggest electricity users, has completed the commissioning of nothing less than 367,769 solar PV panels across its site network as part of its $300 million project, the Zero Cost Energy Future initiative. 
In 2017, SA Water announced its vision of getting to $0 net electricity costs. Given the water utility spent around $86 million last year on electricity, the ambition was immense. With more than 350 kilometres of pipeline to travel, drinking water in South Australia (SA) has to journey a long way from source to water treatment to tap. That journey is now powered by the sun, saving both money and emissions.
With construction complete on all 33 sites and connection complete on 24 of those, SA Water and its partners are now finalising connections on the remaining nine sites and integrating the vast arrays into Australia’s National Electricity Market.
The Zero Cost Energy Future project also involves 34 MWh of energy storage. “Where battery storage is deployed it is energised as part of the site commissioning process, with some storage now online and some to continue being brought online,” a spokesperson for SA Water told pv magazine Australia, regarding the storage rollout. Such additions will continue until SA Water reaches its target generation of 242 GWh of energy per annum, they added.
In January, pv magazine reported that half a million solar panels would be needed to attain this target, however SA Water said today that through efficiencies in design, it was able to achieve its target with a smaller number of solar panels across a smaller physical footprint (a mere 367,769 panels to be precise).

As part of its project, SA Water has deployed the world’s largest fully moveable solar array at its Happy Valley Reservoir, which provides the drinking water of more than 40% of SA Water customers across metropolitan Adelaide. The portable array, which powers the Happy Valley Water Treatment Plant, includes 30,000 modules installed on a 12-hectare site adjacent to the reservoir and generates around 17 GWh of solar energy per year.
“With the ability to generate almost double the energy needs of the nearby Happy Valley Water Treatment Plant, on-site battery storage will complement the solar panels allowing energy to be stored and also released back to the market,” South Australia’s Minister for Environment and Water, David Speirs, said. He has congratulated the project, saying it proves the state’s leadership in renewable energy (an undeniable fact).
“At Happy Valley the local community was heavily involved in the planning for this site so the the solar panel project is visually sympathetic to the natural environment,” Speirs added.
Nicola Murphy, SA Water’s Senior Manager for the Zero Cost Energy Future initiative, said the project, including the energy storage aspect, will reduce the utility’s on reliance on a “volatile grid” and ensure the performance of its assets.
“Just like how thousands of South Australians use solar panels at home, we’re capitalising on some of our physical assets to work harder for us while still performing their vital functions of delivering trusted water and wastewater services,” Murphy said.
“We can also create an added revenue stream by selling any excess solar energy back to the national grid, where it can be used across Australia.”
The project created 250 jobs during construction and will generate enough renewable power for 50,000 homes. Of course, the planned renewable-energy-powered water system flows also into South Australia’s overall intention, declared in 2015, to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.
“This solar initiative was created by our own people, and clearly demonstrates South Australians leading the way to integrate renewable energy and proactively reduce the impacts of climate change,” Murphy added.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/11/redearth-and-rexel-partner-for-nationwide-distribution-as-battery-demand-grows/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"MAY 11, 2021",RedEarth and Rexel partner for nationwide distribution as battery demand grows,"Brisbane-based RedEarth Energy Storage (RedEarth), an Australian designer and manufacturer of lithium-ion battery storage systems, is partnering with wholesale electricity company Rexel Australia (Rexel) to expand its distribution as demand for energy storage systems increases in both metro and regional areas. 
RedEarth, which announced in March that it was partnering with a major housing developer to offer solar and batteries to buyers of its new homes nationwide, is clearly looking to capitalise on the new high-demand for home energy storage systems. 
Rexel, which also sells under the brands of John R Turk, Ideal Electrical and Lear & Smith, will see RedEarth’s lithium-ion storage systems available nationwide for installers and electricians in both metro and regional locations. 
According to RedEarth co-founder and CEO Charles Walker, “There has certainly been an upshift in demand for Australian-made, high quality, battery systems that are designed to weather our environmental conditions.”
According to SunWiz’s Australian Battery Market Report 2021, the residential battery market grew by 20% in 2020 despite the economic downturn brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. SunWiz calculates that in 2020, 31,269 new residential batteries were installed, which resulted in a 27% increase in overall residential storage capacity because the average battery size increased to around 10.9 kWh; that’s up from 10.3 kWh in 2019, but still down from the heights of 2018, when the average size was 11.4 kWh.

However, SunWiz’s Report does not expect energy storage to see a massive episode of growth, but rather a sustained progressive growth, predicting a similar number of installations in 2021 as in 2020. 
“Our partnership with Rexel will provide solar installers and electricians with convenient access to RedEarth’s energy systems throughout the country,” Walker continued. 
Indeed, Rexel has a distribution network of 134 wholesale branches nationwide. Rexel’s Queensland General Manager, Barry Norris said the “distribution partnership with RedEarth is a positive step forward in catering to the rising demand of solar energy systems nationwide. We look forward to working together to provide our customers with high-quality products and service at a competitive price in the market.”

GlobalData’s report “Australia Power Market Outlook to 2030, Update 2021 – Market Trends, Regulations, and Competitive Landscape,” estimates that Australia will reach a solar capacity of 80.22 GW in 2030, a staggering increase from Australia’s 2020 capacity of 17.99 GW. 
The report also forecasts a significant decline in the dominance of thermal power in Australia’s energy mix, seeing it decline from a 58.6% share in the period 2000-2020, to only 27.8% in 2030. 

According to GlobalData power analyst Aditya Sharma, “Australia plans to compensate the decline in thermal and hydropower capacity with renewable power capacity growth. By 2030, the share of renewable power capacity is set to reach 69.9%, driven mostly by solar PV installations.”
GlobalData points to Australia’s various federal, state and local regulatory regimes as one of the primary drivers for Australia’s already world-leading solar deployment. The rate of rooftop solar adoption in Australia well exceeds the global average. 
Indeed, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), more than 260 GW of renewable energy was added globally in 2020, surpassing 2019’s previous net increase record by almost 50%. Australia’s pace of growth was almost double the global average, coming in at 18.4%.
“The growth of solar PV in Australia is driven by frequent renewable energy auctions and offering of feed-in tariffs,” continued Sharma. “In addition to the federal initiatives, all eight provinces offer their own schemes supporting growth of solar PV. For instance, in Australian Capital Territory, in addition to solar PV auctions, the provincial government also offers interest-free loans for rooftop solar.” 
“More than one-fourth of households in Australia have adopted rooftop solar PV,” Sharma concludes. “In some provinces this adoption has crossed 40%. In addition to government policies supporting rooftop solar PV growth, rooftop solar PV adoption helps citizens to avoid high electricity retail prices and offers higher energy security.” 
Of course, let us not forget what looks to be the main driver of solar and renewable energy uptake over the next decade, and that is industry. Environmental and sustainability goals (ESG) are driving the great extractive and unsustainable industries of the past, such as oil, gas and the mining industry, to commit to zero-emissions targets or commit to meet the targets set by their respective nations. 
Craig Bearsley, director of energy at infrastructure developer AECOM in Australia and New Zealand,” told pv magazine Australia that while he could not reveal the total figure he reached in back-of-the-envelope calculations of demand for large-scale solar and wind generation in the coming 10 years, could at least say that the figure was blinding. 
Obviously, with the commitments being made, the calculations of necessary renewable growth required to fulfil those net-zero goals are not difficult to work out, the difficult thing is getting one’s head around just how insatiable the demand for clean energy will become in the coming decades.

In collaboration with LAVO, Aguey-Zinsou helped produced the world’s first residential/commercial hydrogen battery, which stores 40 kWh of energy — that’s three times the capacity of a Tesla Powerwall 2, at 13.5 kWh. 
Aguey-Zinsou says this experience proved that Australia is at the cutting edge of the hydrogen revolution, and that now it is his duty to help other organisations do similar. 
“My life’s objective is to advance the hydrogen economy,” Aguey-Zinsou said. “It is a fantastic tool to help our planet survive the carbon age but we need continuous research to advance the technologies we need to get them to the state and scale required.” 
The aim of H2Potential is to make the hydrogen economy a reality. 
To do this, Aguey-Zinsou says the firm will act as an incubator and an accelerator of some of the world’s most promising hydrogen businesses, as well as acting as an advisor to already established companies looking to “play a role in the hydrogen revolution.” 
This is sure to keep Aguey-Zinsou busy, considering Goldman Sachs has called green hydrogen a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” and estimated that green hydrogen alone (not including grey and blue) “could give rise to a €10 trillion addressable market globally by 2050 for the utilities industry alone.”
“H2Potential will facilitate the rapid growth of hydrogen in Australia and around the world,” continued Aguey-Zinsou. “We will be a catalyst, helping create a carbon-free economy underpinned by renewables and hydrogen.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/11/organic-solar-for-high-speed-data-detection-and-indoor-light-harvesting/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 11, 2021",Organic solar for high-speed data detection and indoor light harvesting,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists at the University of Strathclyde in the United Kingdom have fabricated an organic solar (OPV) device for applications in high-speed optical wireless communication (OWC) which is claimed to operate as an energy-harvesting device and, simultaneously, as a high-speed data detector.
The academics stated that organic PV technology is particularly suitable for this kind of application due to its low cost and flexibility, which enables its integration into internet-connected devices. “Powering a large portion of connected mobile Internet-of-Thing (IoT) devices using flexible OPVs is an attractive solution to overcome the burden of having to charge devices regularly,” they also explained.
The PV device was built with an inverted architecture based on metal oxide-based charge-selective transport layers and metal electrodes made of gold and silver, which the British group said improves the device’s performance stability. It consists of a 4×2.5mm photoactive layer fabricated with a bulk heterojunction of a polymer donor and fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors.
“Under 1 Sun intensity (100 mW/cm2), these solar cells demonstrate a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.8%, and under artificial indoor low-light-intensity illumination (0.3–6 mW/cm2), the PCE is 14%,” the researchers specified.
Four cells of this kind were assembled with a laser-based point-to-point OWC system to build a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system consisting of four laser diodes. The PV devices have separate contacts and the output current from each of them is individually accessible, which means the cells can be used as separate receivers or their signals be combined so that the whole system acts as one receiver.
“The transmitted power of each laser is 56.2 mW,” they further explained. “A data rate of 147.5 Mb/s is achieved with a single-input single-output (SISO) OPV-based system, which is the highest reported data rate with OPVs to the best of the authors’ knowledge. […] These values are further increased to 221 Mb/s or 363 Mb/s and 6.8 mW or 10.9 mW of harvested energy by implementing a 2-by-2 or 4-by-4 OPV-based MIMO system, respectively, for the first time.”
The proposed system configuration, the scientists stated, is designed for a system with four light transmitters and four OPV cells integrated into a single panel, The methodology they applied, however, is claimed to be generally applicable. “As a result, by using the proposed method, it is possible to trade the physical size of the system for both harvested energy and data rate,” they added.
The system is presented in the paper Organic photovoltaics for simultaneous energy harvesting and high-speed MIMO optical wireless communications, published in Light | Science & Applications.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/11/solar-101-how-to-evaluate-solar-contractors-for-rooftop-projects/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"MAY 11, 2021",Solar 101: How to evaluate solar contractors for rooftop projects,"From pv magazine USA
The first articles of our Solar 101 series, (“Is my roof ready for solar?”) and (“Attaching your solar system to your roof”) examined how the age and physical characteristics of a roof affect the design and payback of a prospective solar system. We also discussed the design constraints resulting from wind, dirt, and precipitation.
And, in “Working the angles to maximise your solar system’s output”, we looked at the relationship between a panel’s latitude, pitch and azimuth to its solar electricity output.
Now, we’ll look at how to find a solid solar contractor to build your solar power system.
A well-designed solar system should last 20 or 30 years, or longer. The mounting hardware, which attaches directly to your home, will typically require drilling holes in your roof. But don’t fear. This guide for choosing the right contractor should help ease your concerns.
One rule of thumb: find someone experienced. Installing solar panels, like anything else, involves doing a set of similar actions over and over. Experience represents more than just the labor of attaching solar panels and the required electrical gear. For instance, experience usually indicates:
Recent research by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Berkeley Lab suggests that more experienced contractors offer better pricing.  This chart from their annual Tracking the Sun report doesn’t explicitly break down experience, but it does show how pricing can vary by contractor.

Experienced solar contractors have a truck filled with various odds and ends leftover from prior solar jobs. These little components often mean the difference between finishing a project in a day or two, versus two or three days with several trips to the local hardware store mixed in.
The question then becomes, how do we find an experienced solar contractor?
First off, ask your friends. And – as strange as it may sound – knock on the door of someone who has already installed solar power and ask them. These folks have real experience with a contractor, and can give you a tip or two as you ask questions of prospective contractors.
If you know contractors who have done good work for you already, ask them who they would hire to install a solar system on their roof. Roofing and electrical contractors often have pre-existing relationships with solar contractors because their businesses have a lot of cross-over. Your HVAC contractor may also have a good working relationship with a solar contractor. And finally, local Professional Engineers, or “PE”, (specifically structural and electrical) will have knowledge of the local solar contractors because they have to sign off on solar design drawings.
Another technique is to reach out to your local town hall to learn who the local permit office likes to deal with. Be sure to ask which solar contractors always seem to submit the right paperwork. This question may be more important than it appears, because paperwork is a huge part of a solar installation.
And one last technique: call your local contractor supply houses. Again, the supply houses have relationships with contractors that buy the most hardware from them. For this call, come prepared with a few key questions: Who pays their bills on time, who’s been in business the longest, and who is most organised?
One way to vet a contractor is to simply call them and see how they follow up with you. Their follow-up will give you an idea about the quality of service you might receive later in the process.  Be sure to call an actual local contractor, and not a sales organisation that will simply hand the lead off to a contractor.
A few items to consider when the contractor representative shows up:
After reaching out to locals and others in the know, the next place to go is Google. But beware: Companies – and especially sales organisations – specialise in placing themselves high up the Google search results.
The one place that this author regularly sends people is SolarPowerWorldOnline’s Top 500 list. You’ve got to be smart, however, about using this list.
First, make sure you choose your own state because the default list is national. Second, recognise that companies pay a fee to get on the list. And third, consider that the companies near the top of the list are likely the largest national companies.
A second path to follow without cold calling is to use EnergySage. Contractors submit their profile to the company, must have at least 10 installations with positive reviews, and are regularly re-vetted.
Here’s the key value kicker from EnergySage: After you submit your address, you will get a few quotes from contractors who  know very well that they are competing with at least two or three other contractors. This will likely force these contractors to work their numbers to be competitive.
Contractors pay commissions to EnergySage; about $1,000 if the customer ends up installing. However, that commission is comparable to what a door to door salesperson might make.
Of course, you should also consider the largest national name brand companies, with Sunrun, Sunnova, and Tesla being the big three these days. These companies all have unique offerings, and also some similar products, so research each of them and their offerings to know which might best fit your needs.
Sunrun and Sunnova are best known for their solar lease products. In essence you rent your rooftop to them in exchange for a “free” solar power system. Tesla’s main business is to sell you a system that you fully own, whether it be standard solar panels or their new Solar Glass roof product. Both Sunrun and Sunnova will also sell, but their system costs typically don’t compete with Tesla’s pricing model.
The compromise: when you choose a large national company is that you’re a number. You will likely get the cheapest price for residential solar hardware from Tesla, but there also will probably be less personal interaction and system optimisation.
A small local company might not be able to provide the lowest hardware prices, but it likely will put more effort into customising a design to fit your specific application. And always keep one eye open. Some mid-sized companies will quote twice as much as their competitors.
