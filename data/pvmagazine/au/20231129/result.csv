Wodgina is jointly owned by US giant Albermarle, and billionaire Chris Ellison’s company Mineral Resources, which operates the mine as part of the joint venture agreement.
The cause of the fire is still being investigated and while production remains suspended, the companies do not expect shipping to be impacted by the fire.
“The fire started at approximately 5.30pm and had been brought under control by the Wodgina Emergency Response Team by 7.30pm,” a spokesman for Mineral Resources told the Australian Financial Review. “There were no injuries and the cause of the incident remains under investigation.”
Wodgina is among the world’s largest known hard rock lithium deposits and the mine’s capacity was increased in 2022 when lithium prices skyrocketed. The mine is set to produce 250,000 tonnes of lithium spodumene concentrate this year, with that figure growing to 375,000 tonnes in 2024.
Lithium prices surged last year amid perceived shortages, but collapsed recently following an oversupply.
pv magazine’s upcoming December edition features an in-depth look at Australia’s battery mineral segment, and some of the difficulties it is faces due to commodity pricing collapses and other more structural issues.

In a high-profile ruling in October, Victoria’s High Court sided with two electric vehicle (EV) owners to strike down the Victorian government’s Zero and Low Emission Vehicle Distance-based Charge Act 2021. The court deemed the Victorian government’s tax on electric vehicles “invalid”, saying Australia’s Constitution enshrines that only the Commonwealth government has the power to enforce such taxes.

The Victorian Treasurer this morning said electric vehicle owners will receive their money back in the coming months with interest.
The Victorian government reportedly raised $3.9 million (USD 2.6 million) last financial year from the road-user charge, but treasury officials have said they expect to hand back about $7 million to taxpayers.
“We’ve even decided to be sufficiently generous, albeit that there isn’t an obligation to pay interest,” Treasurer Tim Pallas told reporters on Wednesday. “But we’ll pay interest on the retention of those funds.”
“We’re now going through the process of identifying who it is we need to rebate, and we’ll go through the process of making those returns.”

The legal battle around the EV road user charge was closely watched around Australia as other states were reportedly looking to legislate similar taxes. 
Hopes of such moves now appear moot with the High Court deeming the tax an “excise,” an inland tax on goods, that only the Commonwealth government has the power to apply, according to section 90 of the Constitution.
The High Court’s full October decision is available here.

It would seem Australia’s large-scale segment is falling into a similar pattern to hydrogen of yesteryear – awash with grand announcements, but with very little getting off the ground. In its Q3 Renewable Projects Quarterly Report released today, industry peak body, the Clean Energy Council (CEC), said just six large-scale projects, totalling 509 MW, have been financially committed so far this year. Between 5 GW and 7 GW would need to be financially committed annually to reach Australia’s target of 82% renewable penetration by 2030, it added.

Large-scale renewables in Australia have been facing compounding issues in the years since 2020, when the nation’s Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (RET) scheme was achieved. The problems culminating this year include difficulties securing equipment due to high global demand, soaring insurance premiums and associated project costs, project planning and grid congestion, dropping margins as a result of ever-lowering midday wholesale energy prices, and staffing difficulties. On this backdrop, project owners are struggling to secure offtake agreements that can properly reflect their costs.
While Q3 has been particularly dismal, CEC said that all three quarters of 2023 so far rank in the bottom five for lowest new capacity commitments since 2017.

All of this exemplifies how badly needed the federal government’s Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) is. While the scheme has been floating around for the last year, it initially looked to back just 6 GW of “dispatchable” renewable energy, largely storage. Last week, the scheme was massively broadened to encompass 9 GW of storage capacity and 23 GW of variable renewable generation, for a total of 32 GW nationally.
While the need for storage is acutely being felt in Australia as solar duck curves become so pronounced that balancing the grid is a precarious juggle, the stark downturn in investment of renewable energy generation projects are clearly also a problem for the nation’s transition. This probably factored into the federal governments decision to not just use the scheme to support storage but also large-scale generation projects.
The importance of the scheme cannot be overstated, with Professor Bruce Mountain, director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, describing it as “the biggest news in Australia’s electricity policy for as long as we can remember.”
Coming back to CEC’s quarterly report, the council noted it was not just slow going in terms of financial commitments, but the number of projects reaching construction and commissioning were also underwhelming.

CEC said just three generation projects commenced construction during Q3, comprising 86 MW of additional capacity, while one project reached the commissioning stage, contributing a total of 75 MW. Back on finance, renewable energy generation and storage projects attracted a total of $150 million (USD 99 million), during Q3 2023 – a figure which, again, is among the lowest seen since 2017.
Energy storage has been a bright spot amid the large-scale struggles of the past years, but CEC noted even this segment is stumbling now, failing to continue the strong results of previous quarters. “Large-scale energy storage projects did not replicate the lofty heights seen in the second quarter of 2023, with only 12 MW (installed capacity) / 13 MWh (energy) financially committed for the quarter,” the report said. “This 13 MWh of energy marks the lowest return since the third quarter of 2021.”

Separately, developers have recently been flagging problems investing in Australia’s large-scale segment. Earlier this month, managing director of Canadian infrastructure fund Omers, Kevork Sahagian, said the company was “well short” of its renewable investment goals here, despite having grand ambitions in the country.

The massive increase in solar module production capacity and PV installations in China is helping the country to maintain relatively low, stable power prices compared to Europe and the United States, which suffer from rising PV curtailment and high inflation, according to Wood Mackenzie. Th US-based market research company describes China’s current energy transition trajectory as a virtuous circle in a scenario characterised by falling interest rates, low energy costs, and intense price competition.
Analyst Sharon Feng attributes China’s rapid expansion in solar manufacturing and reduction in solar module costs to its large domestic scale and robust export growth, effectively overcoming cost inflation challenges observed in other markets.
“China’s end-user power prices are less than half those in Europe or Australia and this supports a strong competitive edge in global trade,” said report co-author Alex Whitworth. “The China power market is now larger than that of Europe and the US combined, so if it can succeed in transitioning to a high share of intermittent renewables while maintaining stable prices, that would be a historic achievement.”

PV and wind curtailment in China reached 4% in 2022, down from over 10% before 2020, with analysts suggesting a potential increase in curtailment next year but emphasising it will stay at manageable levels.
China is expected to install approximately 230 GW of new PV and wind capacity this year, surpassing Europe’s 75 GW and 40 GW in the United States. The country is also projected to achieve a cumulative grid-connected energy storage capacity of 67 GW in 2023, with plans to expand to 300 GW by 2030.
The report notes the role of long-distance transmission lines over 1,000 km, unlocking over 100 GW of renewables development in inland China, and points to the design of around 100 GW of flexible plants to support renewable energy backup.
“China’s investment in renewables and support infrastructure in recent years has outstripped what was going into coal power by a factor of 5 to 1,” said Whitworth.  “The share of coal in power generation has been continuously falling, down 10 percentage points in the last five years to about 55% today. About 80% of the reduction was replaced by renewables and the rest mostly by nuclear power.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/29/adaptation-to-climate-change-is-a-vital-discussion-we-need-to-have/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",,"NOVEMBER 29, 2023",Adaptation to climate change is a vital discussion we need to have,"Australia’s political voice has largely been absent from the annual summit of world leaders in recent times. But it was announced that Australia’s Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Senator Jenny McAllister, is set to facilitate consultations to reach outcomes on adaptation at the upcoming COP 28 summit in Dubai.
While it may seem drastic to discuss adapting to climate change impacts when we’re still pursuing effective mitigation, we’ve moved beyond the point of no return for many nations. We’re now set to talk about the efficacy of coastal protection and range-shifting plants which can better tolerate the “new normal”.
These conversations are now, sadly, vital, and Australia can lean on its own experience in climate change to start the ball rolling on these discussions.
Australia facing the prospect of significant adaptation
One of the most exposed sectors in Australia in the immediate term is the agricultural sector, due to crops and livestock being highly vulnerable to both acute and chronic climate events. There are ways the sector can look to adapt, including using new variants of crops (that are more tolerant of the newer climate) or adapting practices to maintain plant survival rate (for example increasing irrigation precision). Agrivoltaics – a technique which consists of mixing the production of photovoltaic electricity and agricultural production in the same area by raising the solar panels above the cultivated ground or cultivating crops in between rows of PV panels – may become more commonplace as a solution to overcome intersecting land use barriers.
As a land proudly girt by sea, in the longer term we may have to consider coastal protection, such as mangrove plantations to provide coastal defence against extreme sea levels and cyclones. In worst case scenarios, we may need to consider relocation as a coastal defence.
Meanwhile, widespread exposure in the immediate term will be felt acutely by the financial sector, which stands at arm’s length to the companies facing the physical impact from climate change. It faces a daunting task to grapple with widespread impact and inability to drive or finance direct adaptation measures on the ground.
Yet Australia’s role at COP 28 is not to talk solely about its own challenges; its role will be to facilitate discussions about the world and what measures need to be taken to both adapt and to finance those adaptation strategies.
 Complexity of climate-related risks
The UNFCC Global Stocktake report highlighted several climate adaptation actions from coastal defence to disaster risk management. With the underinvestment in adaptation measures, public and private sector need to find a way to prioritise efforts.
It’s first important to understand how the complex array of hazards will impact particular communities, economies, and ecosystems and determine criteria for assigning higher importance to specific areas. Factors like systemic social vulnerability, intersecting social risk determinants, population density, net asset value, environmental significance, and cultural importance are some considerations. Uniting around a common set of facts will help bring stakeholders together.
When safeguarding vulnerable populations is the focus, the most immediate adaptation actions can revolve around establishing recovery strategies for climate-related impacts.  A major cyclone’s impact, for example, can extend beyond direct consequences such as casualties and asset damage to include indirect effects like road, electricity, and telecommunication disruptions which can pose significant obstacles to providing disaster relief to affected populations. Therefore, it becomes imperative to devise measures that enhance the resilience of critical infrastructure systems to withstand various climate hazards.
It’s expected that adaptation finance will be a key one within COP negotiations, particularly focusing on compensating developing nations for their losses and damages due to climate impacts. There are mechanisms in place to access funding through “green finance” institutions like the World Bank.
However, due to the urgent need to mitigate the extent of the climate crisis, these investments do see a relative prioritisation.
Mitigation remains the best adaptation strategy
However, I hope that amid all the discussions around adaption that we don’t lose sight of mitigation. Mitigation and adaptation are not mutually exclusive ideas, and the most effective long-term adaptation strategy remains mitigation; the sooner we reduce emissions, the less extensive adaptation will be required. And some investments can serve both purposes.
For instance, the Adelaide Coastal Wetlands Restoration project has the potential to sequester 20,000 tons of CO2 for every 250 hectares restored, and there are many other projects across the nation with similar mitigation potential. Furthermore, recommendations for neighbouring nations and financing them to restore their own rainforests and wetlands can also drive carbon sequestration while supporting biodiversity wellbeing.
Enhanced understanding and valuation of our natural ecosystems will support the incorporation of these resources into decision making for businesses. Frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) are supporting thinking on how to evaluate nature and biodiversity while contextualising the financial impact that businesses would feel should these resources not be managed.
Conversations around adaption strategies are now, sadly, vital. But no matter the long-term strategy, we can’t take our eyes off the ball. And while solutions such as desalination, coastal defence and crop selection will likely become more urgent as the years progress, we should be focusing first on preserving and restoring the ecosystems that already protect us from both chronic and acute climate impacts, which are often the most cost-effective measures.
Mitigation has been and remains the best adaptation strategy, and we need to continue to do everything within our power to rapidly achieve Net Zero.

Researchers led by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) in Germany have studied a residential heat pump (HP) installation coupled with PV, battery storage, and a smart grid-ready system.
“In-depth research is missing in terms of the impact of smart control on the dynamic performance efficiency of the heat pump,” the researchers said. “Extensive work needs to be done to analyse the effect of PV and battery units on the energy consumed by the heat pump by redefining the system boundaries of the PV-HP systems.”
Their analysis is based on a year of data from a single-family home in Freiburg, Germany. It uses a ground-source heat pump with a nominal capacity of 13.9 kW. The PV unit has a module area of 60 square meters and a nominal power rating of 12.3 kW. The battery has a capacity of 11.7 kWh. The system had to account for heating a living space of 256 square meters, as well as a domestic hot water (DHW) tank.
The heat pump of the setup has an SG-Ready label, which means it can communicate with the grid and adjust its own operations. In the context of this research, however, it was used to maximize the PV self-consumption by adjusting the heat pump operation based on available PV electricity.
“In the analysed system, the SG-Ready is configured to trigger the heat pump in boosted operation, whereby the space heating and DHW supply temperatures are increased,” the group explained. “The SG-Ready mode is activated when the battery is fully charged or is charging at its maximum power, and there is still a PV surplus available.”
When the instantaneous PV power stays below the total building demand for at least 10 minutes, the trigger-off condition is met, leading the heat pump to return to normal operation as defined by the system parameters, said the researchers. The thermal and electrical data of the systems used in the research was collected throughout the entirety of 2022 and analyzed at a one-minute resolution.
The researchers said the combined system achieved a self-consumption rate of 43% per year. During the winter, with reduced PV generation, the rate reached 94% to 100%. In the high-PV summer months, self-consumption dropped below 50%, reaching its lowest point in July at 25%.
The scientists also looked into solar fraction (SF), which refers to the ratio of PV electricity supplied directly to the heat pump load, or through battery discharge, to the total heat pump electricity consumption.
“During the evaluation period, the heat pump consumed a total of 5,064 kWh of which a major 63.8% was contributed by grid supply,” they said. “The PV array supplied 899 kWh (17.8%), and the battery unit supplied 934 kWh (18.4%), resulting in an annual solar fraction of 0.36.”
The researchers calculated the seasonal performance factor (SPF) for the combined system, yielding a rate of 6.7, a 59.5% improvement compared to a system solely reliant on the grid to feed the heat pump. Additionally, the smart grid-ready system increased supply temperatures for domestic hot water by 4.1 K and space heating by 1.8 K. However, only 5% of thermal energy in space heating mode and 28% in domestic hot water mode were provided at elevated temperatures.
“The temperature increase reduces the efficiency of 3.5 by 0.2 points and thus by 5.7%,” they said. “In space heating mode, the efficiency is reduced from 5.0 to 4.8 and thus by only 4.0%.”
They presented their findings in “Analysis of the Performance and Operation of a Photovoltaic-Battery Heat Pump System Based on Field Measurement Data,” which was recently published in Solar Energy Advances. The team included scientists from the Offenburg University of Applied Sciences.
