Carnegie Clean Energy, based in Fremantle, has had a long and arduous journey to this point. In March 2019, the company was suspended from ASX after missing the results deadline and lost support from the Western Australian government shortly after. Before the month was over, the company was given a funding lifeline but was forced to sell or wind down its solar microgrid subsidiary. (The finances of wave energy companies are notoriously tricky, more on that below).
Carnegie then focused on its so-called CETO wave energy technology, which now comes in units of 1 MW of generation capacity at the commercial scale. Submerged, buoy-like devices are tied to the seabed and produce oscillating motion with the movement of the waves.

Contracts to harness wave energy in Europe have been going on for some years. In December 2021, Carnegie Clean Energy was selected to receive a contract under the EuropeWave Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) program via its subsidiary CETO Wave Energy Ireland Limited.
EuropeWave PCP is a stage-gate program designed to advance wave energy converter systems to a point from which they can be developed for commercial exploitation through other national or regional programs and private investment.
As part of this programme, in 2022, CETO Wave Energy Ireland undertook tank testing and delivering a CETO concept design for deployment at the open-water facilities of the Biscay Marine Energy Platform (BiMEP) in the Basque Country and the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) in Scotland.
Now, with phase three of the Europe Wave PCP in collaboration between Wave Energy Scotland, and the Basque Energy Agency, EuropeWave has awarded Carnegie $6.3 million (€3,746,531) to deliver and operate an approximately 400 kW version of its CETO wave energy converter off the Spanish coast by 2025.
After this last phase of the Europe Wave PCP programme, each company involved will retain ownership of the intellectual property, the results and any physical models, prototypes or other test pieces produced during the PCP.

The promise of wave energy is neither new nor mastered. In fact, attempts to harness the ocean’s power document all the way back to 1799. Since then, thousands of patents have been filed and as many inventors risen and fallen. Today, there are about 250 companies tenaciously grappling with the problem, Swinburne’s Professor of Fluid Dynamics, Richard Manasseh, previously told pv magazine Australia.
While the mechanisms required to harness energy from the ocean are themselves technically tricky, the real hurdle is our current financial models for commercialising innovation. “The machines don’t work at all unless they are gigantic,” Manasseh says. “So there’s a mismatch between the amount of capital companies tends to have and the size of what they have to build.”
A single wave energy machine can cost anywhere from a few hundred thousand to a few million to build, depending on the design’s sophistication and efficiency. 
It’s hardly surprising then that wave energy has stranded many on the shores of financial ruin. The primary reason for that is not because the designs aren’t good enough or the technology unviable. The issue, Professor Manasseh says, is that our current model for commercialising innovations sees governments take a back seat, letting inventors invent and capitalists provide capital.
This pathway doesn’t work for wave energy converters, Manasseh says, because the machines are actually forms of infrastructure, not products. They’re more comparable to highways than wind turbines. “It’s infrastructure that has to be done on a large scale.”
This doesn’t mean the projects have to be paid for by taxpayers, the professor adds, there are many different financial models which could be used – but it does mean that governments need to make the call.

The All Black modules use TOPCon technology, have an efficiency of 21.5% and come in three power outputs: 415W, 420W, 425W. The Australian warranty will match that in Europe at 25 years for product and 30 years for performance. The company says the range offers 21% carbon dioxide savings per module thanks to its German polysilison supply.
Polysilicon the cause of much controversy in solar manufacturing as forced labour is suspected to be used in its production, which is also an emissions-intensive process. The polysilicon supply chain is today highly concentrated in Xinjiang, China, with Munich-based chemical group Wacker one of the few alternative suppliers.
Prices for the panel range have not been made public, but will undoubtedly fetch a premium for their German design and materials.

When 1Komma5’s solar module range was announced earlier this year, founder Philipp Schröder told pv magazine Australia the company planned to produce 250 MW this year, and was aiming to entirely relocate production to Germany with a target of building its capacity to 5 GW by 2025.
1Komma5, founded in 2021, is aiming to become something of an “Apple store of energy” retailing and installing solar, batteries, electric vehicle chargers, heat pumps and the energy management platform to integrate them into a fully optimised home energy ‘ecosystem.
The German startup is backed by major European entrepreneurs and began aggressively expanding into Australia by October 2022. It did this by acquiring a majority stake in one of Australia’s biggest home solar and battery installation companies, Natural Solar, followed by Solaray Energy in January 2023. 
Having allocated $100 million (USD 67 million) for Australian growth, 1Komma5 APAC CEO and Natural Solar founder, Chris Williams, told pv magazine Australia in March that further acquisitions are on the cards. 
Williams confirmed 1Komma5 and its planned stores will not exclusively sell its own brand of solar panels, saying “we want to sell what Australian customers want.”
1Komma5 will also open its panel brand to outside companies, with Schröder previously saying: “companies that are not part of the group may apply for exclusive regional partnerships to resell both the module and our energy management system Heartbeat in combination with our CRM [customer relationship management software] and working capital tools,” Such an arrangement would allow the startup to grow its reach without the massive capital outlay on acquisitions.

Since the Albemarle bid was endorsed earlier this week, Liontown has seen some unusual trading activity with share prices jumping 9% and trading volumes spiking to 85 million on Thursday, up from 15 million the day before.
Media outlets have speculated the buyer is Australia’s richest person, Gina Rinehart, though this has not been confirmed. Rinehart is understood to already have held a 4.9% stake in Liontown, and it is speculated she is looking to up her stake to gain controls associated with being a substantial shareholder.

Albemarle has already made significant inroads into mining and processing lithium in Australia. The American company already has spodumene resources and lithium conversion facilities at Greenbushes and Wodgina and Kemerton. The buyout of Liontown would further cement the US company’s dominance. 
Albemarle made a new cash offer for Liontown at $3 a share, which the lithium developer’s board backed on Monday this week. This offer was the latest of several from the US lithium producer. The new offer is 20% higher than the $2.50 a share that Albemarle offered in late March this year and which Liontown turned down as being too low. 
During the call with investors on Tuesday, Masters explained Albemarle sees Liontown and its Kathleen Valley lithium deposit as a means to “increase our opportunity to meet rapid and growing lithium demand.” Australia produces more lithium than any other country – generating a third more than the next largest producer, Chile. 
So far, the deal is non-binding and must still be formalised and approved by shareholders. Liontown, whose assets are located in Western Australia, has agreed to let Albemarle review its lithium supply agreements with Ford, Tesla and South Korean battery giant LG Energy Solution, among others, which go through to 2030. 
Liontown’s two Western Australian lithium deposits should start producing from the middle of next year, starting with the flagship Kathleen Valley project, which is one of the largest and highest-grade hard rock lithium deposits in the world. 
According to Reuters, Albermarle executives say that if the Liontown deal closes, the US lithium producer will have to build processing facilities for the Kathleen Valley mine.

The Australian delegation included representatives from Horizon Power and the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia, among other industrial players. The statement issued by the Western Australian (WA) government reported that Horizon Power was able to share its experiences in providing renewable energy to remote communities. The Australian company now has quite extensive experience deploying low-carbon Standalone Power System solutions in regional WA – an area which face similar electrical hurdles to some communities in Indonesia. 

Indonesia and Australia are both currently leading suppliers of coal internationally, and are also both home to large reserves of critical materials, needed for electric vehicles (EV) and renewable energy storage. Indonesia is currently the largest producer of nickel in the world and is aiming to utilise these resources to build out its local battery and EV and battery manufacturing capabilities. Meanwhile, Australia is the top producer of lithium and has cobalt and numerous other mineral resources, with the country’s leadership eyeing similar manufacturing ambitions. 
WA Mines, Energy and Industrial Relations, Bill Johnston, witnessed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the Future Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre, based in Western Australia and Indonesia’s National Battery Research Institute. The MoU between the two organisations is to focus on capacity building, education and training, developing the battery ecosystem and battery standardisation, according to the WA government.

The WA government said the agreement should “strengthen collaboration in battery research, technology and innovation between Australia and Indonesia,” which it noted aligns with the ‘Plan of Action’ signed between WA and the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry passed in July. That month, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Indonesian President Joko Widodo met to forge closer economic ties in the transition to clean energy. 
Coming back to WA, Minister Johnson said, “Western Australia is well-placed to collaborate with Indonesia to meet net-zero targets.”

The hub is planned spread over three locations with assets not only in Bungama but also in Robertstown and Whyalla. It is set to involve a number of large-scale solar plants along with standalone battery installations.
Grid connection for the Bungama battery, announced in 2021, is the first transmission network connection agreement (TCA) for the hub, according to Amp Energy Australia, the regional arm of Canadian renewables, storage and hydrogen project developer.
Amp Energy has additionally flagged a hydrogen producing facility as part of the hub, called the Spencer Gulf Hydrogen Energy Ecoplex.
Combined, the hub’s infrastructure is expected to require investment of around $2 billion (USD 1.28 billion), according to Amp Energy. 
Amp has also made an Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Agreement for Bungama battery as well as securing a benefit sharing agreement with Nukunu Wapma Thura Aboriginal Corporation.
South Australia’s Minister for Trade and Investment Nick Champion noted, “Amp Energy joins a growing list of developers committed to South Australia’s multi-billion dollar pipeline of projects – backed by the government’s dedicated global and national investment agency, Invest SA.”
South Australia has recently commissioned number of large scale renewable energy projects, such as the Spencer Energy Project, as well as forging ahead with vehicle-to-grid technology and plans for critical raw earth mining. “South Australia’s world-leading renewable energy reputation continues to attract significant investment into the state, especially in our regions,” Minister Champion said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/08/nextracker-unveils-three-next-gen-solar-racking-products/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,RACKING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2023",Nextracker unveils three next-gen solar racking products,"Nextracker, a provider of tracking and mounting solutions for utility-scale solar projects, announced three next-generation editions of its products. These include a hail-ready stowing mechanism, a terrain-following tracker and a new irradiance tracking system.
“Our product development priorities are informed by listening to customers and innovating to create value for them,” said Nextracker founder and chief executive officer, Dan Shugar.
The company will exhibit the products in booth 2511 at RE+ Las Vegas, September 11-14, 2023.
“The suite of hardware and software technologies launched today benefits customers by accelerating construction, reducing risk in extreme hail, and generating more energy in rapidly changing atmospheric conditions. These technologies deliver improved solar project profitability, and expand the geographic areas where solar is cost effective, furthering our vision of a world powered by renewables.” 
According to Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, Nextracker has been the solar tracker global market share leader for eight consecutive years. It has shipped more than 75 GW of trackers as of the end of 2022.
NX Horizon Hail Pro
The hail pro is built upon Nextracker’s NX Horizon, a tracking system with balanced design, integrated UPS, and independent row architecture. The company said its racks can stow panels up to four times faster than standard trackers, allowing them to rapidly respond to the threat of hail.
The Hail Pro components add automatic stowing using weather service data and hail readiness services. A Hail Pro-75 feature can be added for stowing at up to 75 degrees for regions with extreme hail risk. The solution was made in collaboration with customers, independent engineers, and experts from the insurance industry.
“Getting insurance in hail prone geographies like Texas is an increasingly challenging issue solar project developers and owners face today,” said Michael Alvarez, chief operating officer and co-founder of Longroad Energy. “Advanced technology, like Nextracker’s new Hail Pro suite is directionally where our industry needs to be going.”
Zonal Diffuse
Zonal Diffuse builds on the company’s TrueCapture yield optimisation software. The tracking software rapidly responds to changes in irradiance. The software adds higher spatial resolution sensing and new control algorithms, responding to variations in cloud cover across the solar plant.
“Plants equipped with Zonal Diffuse can ‘chase clouds’ for additional gains, without compromising tracking performance during clear sky conditions,” said Nextracker.
Zonal Diffuse is compatible with Split Boost, a tracking optimisation algorithm for half-cell modules. A third-party validation report can be found here.
NX Horizon XTR-1.5
The XTR series of trackers is designed for uneven terrain, used in utility-scale projects since 2019. The updated XTR-1.5 edition reduces or eliminates earthwork on extreme terrain sites, without adding joints or additional components.
Nextracker said the XTR can save many tons of steel with shorter piles and thousands of cubic yards of cut and fill. This will come with the benefit of shortened construction schedules, minimised environmental impact, and reduced project risk, said Nextracker.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/08/anode-less-redox-flow-batteries-capable-of-fast-cycling/,"ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2023",Anode-less redox flow batteries capable of fast cycling,"From pv magazine Global
Redox flow batteries that incorporate solid energy-storing materials are attractive for high-capacity grid-scale energy storage due to their high theoretical energy densities. However, their practical implementation is held back by low rate capability.
Now, a group of researchers led by Albuquerque-based Sandia National Laboratories have demonstrated a lithium-sulfur redox mediated flow battery that utilises a high surface area lithium scaffold to enable even 10 times faster cycling.
In their previous research, the group had designed a redox mediated lithium-sulfur hybrid flow battery containing a lithium metal anode and sulfur in the catholyte reservoir. However, they had observed that the charge rate was limited by dendrite growth on the lithium anode.
This issue, which is common to many lithium-metal-based redox flow batteries, imposes considerable design constraints. Namely, the limited charge rate increases the minimum required electrochemical cell size for a given power output and drives system costs upwards.
To address these limitations, the researchers have replaced the planar lithium anode in redox mediated lithium sulfur redox flow batteries with a high surface area scaffold, which enabled 10 times faster cycling, up to 10 mA cm−2, compared to the same systems with planar anodes, without short circuit or voltage instability.
In their latest study, the researchers first tested the high surface area nickel foam in lithium/lithium symmetric cells and then in a full prelithiated redox flow battery.
They have further improved the cell performance with the addition of zinc oxide to the nickel foam, which promotes better lithium wetting, improving the Coulombic efficiency of the cells.
Finally, they demonstrated that the use of the zinc oxide-nickel foam scaffold also allows the redox flow batteries to be built in an “anode-less” configuration, improving the safety and decreasing the cost to assemble and ship a battery.
Importantly, these improved cells have also shown scalability. Namely, when the sulfur loading is increased from 2.4 to 5 mg cm−2 the capacity is also increased. In fact, with loadings at 5 mgS cm−2 the power density of their redox flow battery was over 20 Wh L−1, making it comparable to vanadium redox flow batteries.
“Having addressed the limitations of the Li anode, there is now further room for improvement of the system by investigating kinetic limitations of the Li-S reaction and capacity fade caused by polysulfide shuttling,” the researchers write. “The fast cycle rate and scalability of the system shows that it is viable for grid scale energy storage in the future.”
Their findings are discussed in “Fast cycling of ‘anode-less’ redox-mediated Li-S flow batteries,” published in the Journal of Energy Storage.
