Indian manufacturer Saatvik Solar, which is aiming for 3GW of annual photovoltaic equipment production output by the end of next year, has reached 1GW through the addition of a 500MW mono PERC panel factory in the state of Haryana. The new production base is equipped to make mono PERC, half-cut, multi-busbar technology to produce high-efficiency solar modules with a power output of 530-610Wp, the company said.
Saatvik is setting up an additional 1.2GW of solar production capacity in the city of Gandhidham, in Gujarat state, by the end of March next year and has said it plans to create an “eco system” featuring module and cell manufacturing.
“As a part of the government plan to achieve 280GW of solar capacity by 2030, and to bring cutting-edge technology to India for manufacturing high-efficiency modules, we have just added 500MW [of] mono PERC, half-cut, MBB [multi-busbar] technology to produce high-efficiency solar PV modules,” said Saatvik CEO Prashant Mathur. “Further, we are setting up a greenfield manufacturing project in Gandhidham, Gujarat, to raise manufacturing output to 3GW by 2023.”

Highly Efficient and Reliable Inverter Concept (HERIC) is the name of a circuit and the associated process that Heribert Schmidt and his colleagues from Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE invented in 2002 and that is protected by patents in Europe and the USA. According to the research institute, the topology is used in single-phase inverters, for example in photovoltaic roof systems, and enables very high efficiencies of up to 99% with low interference emissions with little additional effort, compared to conventional inverters. In addition to the higher energy yield, the advantages are lower thermal stress for the components, smaller heat sinks, and longer service life.
The Fraunhofer ISE estimates that more than 80% of all single-phase inverters used worldwide are based on its HERIC topology, although in many cases its use is not allowed. “A large number of manufacturers have used the circuitry or the process in its original form or in modified versions that nevertheless infringe the patent without the consent of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. The latter was confirmed by the Munich I Regional Court,” said Fraunhofer ISE in a statement.
The institute said it has secured seven patent infringement settlements against companies from China, Taiwan and Germany, all of them out-of-court. As a result of the settlements, Fraunhofer ISE receives payments for the licensing of its HERIC topology and the companies making the payments are allowed to continue selling their products.
“The infringement of IP rights of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft is, therefore, not worthwhile for infringers. IP from Germany is in many products of the photovoltaic industry and not infrequently the patents on them are infringed. We are prepared to take action against patent infringements,” said Andreas Bett, director of the Fraunhofer ISE. “As the infringement proceedings have shown, it would also have been economically worthwhile for the companies concerned to take care of a license at an early stage.”

The investment deal will see Trilantic take a 60% stake in Gransolar Group.
Gransolar Group has already built more than 1 GW of solar and storage capacity in Australia. In 2021, the company announced its battery division, E22, would develop 13 large-scale batteries in South Australia, Victorian and NSW.
“Australia continues to be one of the Gransolar Group’s most important markets and Trilantic will further strengthen our position here,” Managing Director of Gransolar Group Australia, Carlos Lopez, said.
“2022 is set to be another strong year for Gransolar Group in Australia and our local workforce. We are looking forward to announcing new solar and storage projects in the coming months,” Lopez added.

The updated guide has community owned company Enova Energy and Diamond Energy tied in first place, with Powershop dropping to 10th place nationally.
AGL, Australia’s largest energy provider, placed dead last with a score of just one star. It wasn’t the only giant stranded at the bottom with Origin Energy, Energy Australia and ActewAGL also scoring just one star. 
Greenpeace
The 48 energy providers included in the guide were ranked according to the following six criteria: providing renewable energy; committing to ending coal use by 2030; halting fossil fuel expansion; supporting new renewable energy; transparency in marketing; and pollution and environmental harm. 
28 of the 48 electricity companies assessed by Greenpeace scored three stars or below. In other words, the clear majority of Australian retailers were found to not be particularly green. 
Greenpeace
The updated guide, first published by Greenpeace Australia Pacific back in 2018, has sparked calls for information surrounding the emissions intensity of retailers’ power sales to be made public. 
Partnering with Greenpeace on the guide, the Total Environment Centre (TEC) is considering formally proposing a change to the National Electricity Rules which would require all retailers to calculate and publish such information.
“There is only one source of the electrons that flow to your home or business,” TEC’s Energy Market Advocate Mark Byrne said. “But retailers have choices about where they buy their electricity from. Unfortunately, at present that information is very difficult to obtain. We want to make it mandatory and transparent.”
Greenpeace Australia Pacific senior campaigner Glenn Walker said the guide aims to “cut through the increasingly common practice of greenwashing.” 
“Many companies continue using dirty coal, while spruiking the use of carbon offsets which often do more harm than good,” Walker said.
Around 76% of Australia’s electricity still comes from the burning of fossil fuels today, with the country found to have the highest greenhouse gas emissions from coal power in the world on a per capita basis, according to Greenpeace.
Enova Energy and Diamond Energy both scored a perfect five stars, though for different reasons. 
Enova Energy is a small, community owned retailer based in Byron Bay. It gives half its profits back to the community and sources electricity via customer distributed solar panels, Greenpeace said. 
Diamond Energy retained first place (in 2018, it tied with Powershop) by offering 100% renewable power and also investing in renewable energy.
“Enova, Diamond Energy, Energy Locals and other new, small retailers are challenging the big three (Origin, AGL and EnergyAustralia) with their commitment to source only renewable energy for their customers,” TEC’s Mark Byrne said. “These new retailers are introducing improved ways of serving their customers, including tariffs that allow people to buy from and sell to the grid at times that suit them. They are also committed to working with communities to ensure that the power and profits stay local. Some, like Enova, are investing in innovations like community scale batteries, to make the most use of rooftop solar energy exported to the grid.”
Powershop lost its top spot, dropping down to 10th position following its acquisition by Shell which caused widespread outrage. The sale of what was previously labelled ‘Australia’s greenest electricity provider’ to the fossil fuel giant reportedly caused around 6000 customers to close their Powershop accounts after it was announced last November.
Greenpeace said AGL earned its position at dead last because of the company’s commitment to burning coal until 2048, its frequent local environmental harm, and continued coal mining. ““AGL is Australia’s biggest climate polluter, accounting for about 8% of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. 83% of AGL’s generation comes from burning coal, and the company continues to hide behind greenwashing efforts and a dodgy planned demerger instead of taking meaningful action,” Greenpeace’s Glenn Walker said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/09/powering-up-perc-perovskite-tandem-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"FEBRUARY 9, 2022",Powering up PERC-perovskite tandem cells,"From pv magazine Global
Tandem solar cells, where a perovskite layer is integrated on top of a silicon solar cell, have developed rapidly to demonstrate efficiencies close to 30%, and the first commercial devices will likely be seen within the next couple of years.
Silicon is already well established, accounting for around 95% of the solar cells on the market. So the bulk of the work on tandem cells has focused on the new, yet to be commercialised, perovskite element. On the silicon side, researchers have most often chosen heterojunction (HJT) cells as these offer the simplest route to high efficiency. Most of the silicon cells currently being produced, however, use passivated emitter rear cell (PERC) technology, so integrating perovskite with these would have much higher industrial reach, and has already been shown to work well.
“PERC technology as the current industrial standard is a very promising option to evolve into a low-cost tandem device,” said a group of scientists led by Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE. “However, the pathway towards an optimised tandem device based on PERC technology (Pero-PERC) needs to be further investigated.” The group’s latest work, a paper titled How to make PERC suitable for perovskite–silicon tandem solar cells: A simulation study, published in Progress in Photovoltaics, simulates the behaviour of five different PERC-like cell concepts in tandem devices, noting advantages and constraints for each, and guidelines for optimisation.
The group evaluated five variations on the PERC cell structure, focusing on potential upgrades to the front side of the silicon cell. They note that their integration into a tandem device will change both the light-absorbing and charge carrying characteristics of the silicon cell, allowing for optimisations that would improve the overall efficiency. “One aspect is the option to significantly reduce recombination and transport losses, because of the increased design freedom concerning blue response, the higher series resistance tolerance, and the fact that for monolithic 2-terminal tandems, no lateral transport at the front side is needed,” they explain. “This is an important factor to close the efficiency gap to SHJ bottom cells that are currently applied in record tandem devices but still lack industrial maturity.”
Several of the cell concepts investigated made use of tunnel-oxide passivation, making them more similar to the TOPCon cells currently being introduced in large-scale production. The group noted that such cells could reach efficiencies up to 30.5%, but would require development of new transparent electrode materials, while working with the full TOPCon cell structure could offer a solution to this.
