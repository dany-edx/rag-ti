Gentari is the newly-formed clean energy arm of Malaysian oil giant Petronas. In February, Gentari acquired Wirsol Energy’s portfolio of Australian solar and storage projects. Now, its CEO Sushil Purohit has said Australia and India will be its primary markets for growth in the near term.
Speaking to Reuters, Purohit said Gentari expects to tap into more finance to meet its aim of building a portfolio with 30 GW to 40 GW of renewable capacity by 2030. Australia, it seems, will be central to that vision, with Purohit citing the right policies to facilitate projects.
“In terms of expansion, we will seek to collaborate with companies in different markets. If there is a good strategic fit for us, we would look at that as an opportunity for us to buy into the company or acquire the company in totality,” Purohit said.
Gentari’s recent purchase of Wirsol’s Australian portfolio, understood to have been priced at just under $1 billion (USD 705 million), marks the company’s entry into the Australian renewable energy market. 
It is not clear precisely how much more the company is seeking to invest in Australia, but Gentari’s parent company Petronas previously said it would allocate 20% of its overall capital expenditure for decarbonisation projects from 2023 to 2026. In 2022, Petronas’ planned capital expenditure was worth RM 60 billion ($20 billion).
Similarly, Japan’s Nippon Steel is reportedly exploring a project with a price tag of approximately $1.1 billion (JPY 100 billion) or more. Executive Vice President Takahiro Mori pointed to Australia and Brazil as possible sites.
Mori told BloombergNEF that both countries have high-grade iron ore and cheaper electricity than Japan.
The project would involve producing green steel using green hydrogen for its manufacturing process, currently the most progressed pathway towards decarbonising one of the world’s most polluting industries: steelmaking. 
“We can’t avoid pathways toward carbon neutrality,” Mori said. “We are currently comparing several projects to see if there’s anything that meets the conditions for green-steel manufacturing or investment.”
In December 2022, Nippon rival Posco Group, a major South Korean steel producer, announced it would invest $60 billion in Australia by 2040 across the green steel supply chain, including in renewable generation, electrolysis and steel making processes.
In terms of investment allocation, Posco pledged $41.8 billion for hydrogen production, including renewable energy generation and electrolysis. The further $18 billion will go specifically towards green-steel manufacturing.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/07/australian-company-to-lodge-application-for-rare-earth-mine-in-sa/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 7, 2023",South Australian miner to lodge application for critical rare earth mine,"Buoyed by the results of successful drilling campaigns in 2021 and 2022, South Australia-based Australian Rare Earths is now undertaking environmental studies ahead of lodging its mining application to the South Australian government.
The company is seeking to mine rare earths, including praseodymium, neodymium, terbium, and dysprosium, which are crucial to the permanent magnets used in renewable energy products like electric vehicles (EVs) and wind turbines.
The project is part of a major trend in Australia, which is increasingly seeking to answer worldwide calls for “friendshored” supplies of critical minerals, including rare earths. Both industry and Australian governments at various levels are vying to become a serious supply alternative to China.
The company’s flagship Koppamurra ionic clay rare earths project has already been granted licenses to explore between Keith and Naracoorte in southeast South Australia, extending into Victoria. These exploration campaigns have delivered the company promising results, and community and land manager Jacqui Owen says Australian Rare Earths is now in the early stages of a three-year process to apply for a mining licence.

It appears the proposed mining application would sit between Mount Gambier and Naracoorte, on the state’s southeastern tip. “The actual mining lease area, we’ve sort of nominated an area but we think it will potentially be slightly smaller than we’ve nominated,” Owen told the ABC.
The company is now conducting environmental assessments, including looking at things like groundwater, soils, air quality, and noise impacts.
The company says the Koppamurra is unique in that the rare earths in the nominated region are hosted in clay, not rock – which is usually the case. Once the environmental and impact studies are completed, the company will lodge its mining application to the South Australian Department of Energy and Mining.
The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), in combination with current global geopolitical and economic crises, has the potential to supercharge Australia’s critical minerals, rare earths and raw materials industries. The US, UK, EU and others are increasingly preferring to source clean energy materials from allies like Australia.
Australia is already a major exporter of rare earth and critical minerals, but China completely dominates the refined or “processed” market. 
While Australian Rare Earths’ project is seemingly only targeting the raw material mining side, its latest financial report says the company has already “entered into strategic relationships with internationally recognised downstream processors of rare earths.”
The federal organisation Geosciences Australia recently published a report which found in the year to December 2020, Australia’s economic inventories increased for rare earths (up 4%), lithium (up 8%), vanadium (up 23%) and platinum group elements, which increased an impressive 185%.
“We’re seeing demand for these minerals grow, particularly as the world transitions to low-emissions technologies,” Geoscience Australia’s Director of Mineral Resources Advice and Promotion Allison Britt said.
In March 2022, the federal government allocated $240 million for critical minerals supplies. To a similar end, it also granted Western Australian miner Iluka Resources a $1.25 billion loan to build Australia’s first integrated rare earths refinery to supply electric vehicle and renewable energy industries earlier this month. 
The markets for critical minerals, including rare earths, have already expanded significantly in the last years and are set to grow far, far more before 2050.

Renewables provided 1,068 GWh across the month, of which 609 GWh came from utility-scale solar and 459 GWh from wind.
Utility-scale solar saw a substantial 22% year over year growth in NSW, equating to an extra 112 GWh. This is before the coal-pivoting NSW has even seen the effects of its decade of rolling renewable tenders, part of the state’s momentous vision of fitting out 12 GW of renewable energy capacity and 2 GW of storage by 2030.

Queensland’s solar generation also grew a massive 41%, adding 131 GWh compared to 2022.
The 100 MW Merredin Solar Farm in Western Australia’s central Wheatbelt region was crowned the country’s best performing utility-scale PV facility with a 43.4% (AC) capacity factor (CF). The solar farm, acquired by Singapore-headquartered Surya Utama Nuansa (SUN) Energy from original developer Risen Energy in October 2021, was ranked the nation’s top performing large-scale PV asset in 2021 and 2022.
Amp Energy’s Hillston solar farm in NSW was the next best performer, recording 39.3 % (AC) in February, followed by Neoen’s Giffith solar farm 39.1% (AC).
In total, February 2023 ended with all Australian utility-scale solar and wind assets generating 3,751 GWh, a 12% increase from the 3,347 GWh recorded in February 2022, Dixon said.
Victoria was the only state that “saw any meaningful growth in wind generation,” Dixon added, growing 17% or 111 GWh. This is despite the fact all the best utility wind assets for the month were located in Western Australia, including APA Group’s Badgingarra wind farm, Ratch and Alinta Energy’s Yandin Wind Farm, and Iberdola’s Walkaway Wind Farm.
Meanwhile, gas generation in South Australia was well below the expected long term range of 240 GWh to 580 GWh, sitting at just 204 GWh in February 2023.

CopperString 2.0 is an 1,100-kilometre, high voltage electricity transmission network that would connect Mount Isa and the North West Minerals Province to the national electricity grid near Townsville in north Queensland.

Hailed as the largest geographical expansion of Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) since it was established, the transmission lines will provide connection options for mining and industrial customers in the region and open up enormous tracts of land previously closed to solar and wind development. The government expects 6 GW of renewable capacity to be opened up by CopperString. The project is also set to unlock a clean energy hub at Hughenden, which includes the Kennedy Energy Park.
The acquisition delivers on the Queensland government’s $62 billion Energy and Jobs Plan launched in 2022. The state is aiming to supply 70% of its energy demand from renewables by 2032, and 80% by 2035. It plans to reach these targets by constructing what it’s calling the “Queensland SuperGrid” – a massive fit out of solar, wind, battery and hydrogen generators connected through publicly-owned transmission assets.
The Queensland government-owned transmission business Powerlink will now lead the work on the CopperString project, taking over from the previous private developer CuString.

“Unlocking 6,000 MW of new renewable capacity is the equivalent of doubling the existing large-scale solar and wind farms in Queensland,” said Stephanie Gray, deputy director of Queensland community group Solar Citizens.
“It’s also great to see the Queensland Government demonstrating their commitment to keeping energy assets in public hands. In other states we’re seeing privatised network companies making a mint from consumers.”
The CopperString project has been percolating for decades. As with many of Australia’s transmission projects the costs have blown out from the initially planned $1.5 billion to $5 billion.

This doesn’t seem to have fazed the Queensland government, which has attributed the increase to “current global supply chain conditions.” 
The project’s original developer CuString already received planning and environmental approvals for CopperString, including the purchase of land corridors, and the project has been “shovel-ready” since late 2022. 
During its development, CopperString has received tens of millions of dollars in industry finance as well as state and federal government funding.
The project will now be expanded with a higher-capacity 500kV line from Townsville to Hughenden, a 300kV line from Hughenden to Cloncurry and a 220kV line from Cloncurry to Mount Isa.
The Queensland government has been pushing hard to establish green manufacturing and materials processing in the state, already one of Australia’s most prolific mining hubs.
On top of unlocking new renewable generation projects in the region, CopperString is set to increase the use and export of critical minerals such as copper, zinc, vanadium and cobalt from Mount Isa, and support the burgeoning clean energy and hydrogen industries in Townsville.
“The CopperString 2.0 transmission line will unlock North Queensland’s world-class renewable resources and provide cheap electricity to emerging manufacturing industries in Townsville and existing heavy industry in Mount Isa,” Solar Citizen’s Stephanie Gray said.
“Right now industries in Mount Isa are struggling because they have to rely on expensive gas-fired power. An injection of cheap and clean energy is just what the doctor ordered to ensure Queensland’s industry can remain globally competitive.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/07/agrivoltaics-can-provide-food-energy-for-growing-world-population/,"RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 7, 2023","Agrivoltaics can provide food, energy for growing world population","From pv magazine USA
Agrivoltaics solve at least two critical needs. Solar provides the renewable energy needed to mitigate climate change impacts while meeting global energy demand. And crops grown alongside solar help to feed the burgeoning global population, which is anticipated to grow to nearly 10 billion people by 2050, according to the United Nations.
Cornell University researchers have examined agrivoltaics to find out if there is merit to the perception that co-located sites will see major tradeoffs between food and energy production. Their study has shown how solar and crop production cannot only exist side by side, but how co-location improves the microclimates of farms and the surface temperature of solar modules.
The researchers have developed a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) microclimate model, which they evaluated against experimental data to investigate the effects of panel height, light reflection (albedo), and how much water is evaporated (evapotranspiration) in a PV site. They published their results in Applied Energy.
“We now have, for the first time, a physics-based tool to estimate the costs and benefits of co-locating solar panels and commercial agriculture from the perspective of increased power conversion efficiency and solar-panel longevity,” said lead author Henry Williams, a doctoral student in Cornell Engineering.
The team demonstrated an agrivoltaic facility with soybeans growing under solar modules mounted about 13 feet high exhibits solar module temperature reductions of up to 50 F (10 C), compared to a solar farm mounted at just 1.6 feet over bare soil.
The researchers noted that as modules experience efficiency losses between 0.1 and 0.5 % per degree above 77 C, the implication is that solar conversion efficiency is greater when solar is mounted above crops compared to exposed soil or gravel. In addition to efficiency improvements, years of reduced operating temperatures will lead to improved solar module lifespan, according to the researchers, which they believe speaks to the long-term economic potential of agrivoltaic systems.
“There is potential for agrivoltaic systems – where agriculture and solar panels coexist – to provide increased passive cooling through taller panel heights, more reflective ground cover and higher evapotranspiration rates compared to traditional solar farms,” said senior author Max Zhang, professor in the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, “We can generate renewable electricity and conserve farmland through agrivoltaic systems.”
In addition to the noted benefits, pairing energy and crops solves the land use issues faced by both solar developers and large-scale farmers. According to a previous research study from Zhang’s group, about 40% of utility-scale solar farm capacity has been developed on agricultural lands in New York state, while about 84% of land deemed suitable for utility-scale solar development is agricultural.
“As you decrease the solar panel operating temperature, you can increase efficiency and improve the longevity of your solar modules,” said Williams, “We’re showing dual benefits. On one hand, you have food production for farmers, and on the other hand, we’ve shown improved longevity and improved conversion efficiency for solar developers.”
With global food demands expected to increase by 50% by 2050, according to the World Resources Institute, and the need to mitigate the impact of climate change, agrivoltaics appears to offer a myriad of benefits, the study concludes.
“Up to this point, most of the benefits from agrivoltaic systems have revolved around hot and arid climate zones,” said Zhang, also the Kathy Dwyer Marble and Curt Marble Faculty Director for the Cornell Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future, “This paper is taking a step toward evaluating the viability of agrivoltaics in climates representative of the Northeastern U.S. in relaxing the land-use competition the world faces.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/07/renewable-energy-institutional-investment-has-gone-from-niche-to-mainstream/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 7, 2023",Renewable energy institutional investment has gone ‘from niche to mainstream’,"From pv magazine USA
Renewable energy’s share of electricity generation has grown 42% from 2010 to 2020, said the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, increasing to about 20% of utility-scale generation in the U.S.
While there have been bumps along the road, the inevitable energy transition, boosted by the emergence of mission-driven investing, has attracted “an unprecedented wave of investment”, said Andrew Redinger, Managing Director and Group Head of Utility, Power & Renewable Energy for KeyBanc Capital Markets, in a white paper.
Bloomberg NEF reports that global investment in renewables totalled USD 226 billion ($335 billion) in the first half of 2022, an increase of 11% year-over-year from 1H 2021. Redinger discussed this growth at the 2022 RE+ conference in Long Beach, California.
Redinger said KeyBanc has long been involved in renewables, giving it an early foothold in a rapidly evolving industry. Under his leadership over the last two decades, KeyBanc has committed more than USD 12.3 billion ($18.2 billion) to renewable energy clients, and has financed a cumulative capacity of 43 GW of capacity.
“We bank most of North America’s investor-owned utility companies, and have been doing so since the late 1990s,” said Redinger. “In 2007, we saw that renewable energy was coming on like a freight train as an opportunity that could complement our core business.”
In the last 24 months, the KeyBanc director said renewable energy in the institutional investment world has gone “from niche to mainstream.”
One sign of this mainstream nature is an increase in competition in the sector. Redinger said when KeyBanc got started in the space, developers wouldn’t approach the bank until they were ready to put a shovel in the ground. Now, they’re approaching banks months or even years before breaking ground for construction.
“That’s just a natural maturation of the industry – as more capital has come in, capital providers have to be more aggressive to win deals, and that means lending earlier and earlier,” said Redinger.
Renewable energy investment has evolved from the “Yieldco” financing era of the mid 2010s. At the time, the industry was ready to take another step forward, but was held back by a lack of capital. A solution that emerged was a structure that allowed developers to put assets in a C-Corporation and then attract investors looking for a yielding product.
However, this model did not lead to long term buy-and-hold investors. Hedge funds snapped up these assets, and when “clouds appeared on the horizon” they sold, and the market collapsed.
Redinger said the profile of investors is different now, though, and he expects a much better reaction from equity markets. “This new batch of IPOs won’t be dividend-paying entities, they’ll be buying and holding renewable assets with a tremendous amount of growth potential. So, they’ll be growth vehicles versus yield vehicles,” he said.
The Inflation Reduction Act is expected to further supercharge renewables investment, which Redinger said was already so red-hot that it was not necessary in his view. He likened the USD 369 billion ($547 billion) package to throwing gasoline on a roaring bonfire. Regardless, he said tax credits will help accelerate renewables procurement, which has now doubled 2030 projections following the legislation.
While project-based financing has carried the torch for the energy transition, Redinger said he sees a new massive source of capital opening to the industry. Once potential source is the multi-trillion-dollar Term Loan B marketplace.
“That marketplace tends to lever these deals up more than banks, they tend to be less restrictive and, I think, that will end up being a better source of capital for renewables,” said Redinger.
Redinger admits that there may be more bumps on the road for the renewables sector as the U.S. navigates supply chain constraints and grid interconnection issues, but the long arc looks very promising for the industry.
“There is so much incentive now to go out and get these projects built and operating,” he said. “We may hit a couple of speed bumps here in the near term, but we’re going to figure it out.”
