Under the off-take deal, Telstra has committed to buy half of the energy generated by the solar plant being built on a 255-hectare site about 40 kilometres northwest of Gympie.
Mytilineos, which acquired the project earlier this year from Brisbane-based developer Renewable Energy System Technologies (REST) Energy, has already started pre-construction works. While no delivery date has been provided, the project is set to connect to the national grid via the existing overhead power line infrastructure that transects the site.
Telstra’s Product and Technology Executive Kim Krogh Andersen said the agreement is the telco’s fifth PPA and takes it a step closer to its goal of meeting 100% of its power consumption with renewables by 2025.
“We’ve supported more than $1.1 billion worth of renewable energy projects across Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales (NSW) as a way to reduce Australia’s reliance on non-renewable energy from fossil fuels,” he said.
“Once these projects are fully up and running, our share of their renewable energy output will be equivalent to more than 80% of our consumption.”
Telstra’s existing PPAs include renewable energy from the 70 MW Emerald Solar Park in Queensland’s Central Highlands region. It also has offtake agreements in place with the MacIntyre Wind Farm in Queensland, along with the Murra Warra Wind Farm in Victoria and Crookwell Wind Farm in NSW.
The Munna Creek Solar Farm is Mytilineos’ ninth solar farm project in Australia. The company’s portfolio includes the recently completed 110 MW Moura Solar Farm in central Queensland and the 30 MW Wagga North, Corowa and Junee solar farms in NSW.
Also included in the portfolio is the 40 MW Kingaroy Solar Farm in Queensland which is now in the final stage of construction and is expected to begin commercial operations in “late 2023”.
Other projects include the 75 MW Wyalong, which has now begun feeding into the grid, and the 19 MW Wagga South and 28 MW Moama solar plants being developed in NSW.

The project, acquired by the Queensland government earlier this year, would integrate the state’s isolated northwest into the National Electricity Market (NEM) and pave the way for the development of renewable energy projects, including large-scale wind and solar, in the region while also opening up access to large deposits of minerals seen as key to the energy transition.
Powerlink said the works packages released this week encompass a range of activities and services, including engineering, construction, environmental management, logistics, camp construction, haulage and communications.
Ian Lowry, Powerlink’s executive general manager for major projects, said the release of the packages sends a clear signal to the market that Powerlink is ready to start work.
“Since Powerlink took on this project earlier this year, we have been focused on starting work on the ground as soon as possible,” he said.
“Our process is not just about finding the best value for money, but also about finding the best fit for our vision.”
Lowry said the packages are designed to maximise the opportunities for local businesses and suppliers with Powerlink determined to create a sustainable and resilient supply chain that benefits local communities along the CopperString line.
“This is an opportunity for regional business to register their interest in being a part of a project that will transform north and northwest Queensland for generations to come,” he said.
Powerlink said a series of road shows will be held throughout the project area next month, where local suppliers and contractors will have the opportunity to learn more about the scope and timeline of the project and discuss potential business opportunities.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/28/la-trobe-to-build-largest-urban-solar-farm-in-victoria/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2023",La Trobe to build ‘largest urban solar farm’ in Victoria,"La Trobe University has announced it will build a 2.9 MW solar farm at its Bundoora campus as the university targets net zero emissions from its Victorian campuses before the end of the decade. The PV facility will be supported by a 2.5 MW battery energy storage system of unspecified duration.
Vice-Chancellor Professor John Dewar said the $10 million (USD 6.4 million) La Trobe University Renewable Zone, which will take the total solar generation at the Bundoora campus to a combined 5.8 MW, is the next step in the university’s commitment to being an industry leader in sustainability.
“The Renewable Zone is a vital step in this journey,” he said, adding that “universities are perfectly placed to not just research ways to reduce emissions and develop renewable energy technologies, but to be change leaders in implementing innovative solutions.”
The La Trobe Renewable Zone is being developed on a 3.5-hectare site at the Bundoora campus with construction due to begin in early 2024.
Once operational, the facility is expected to reduce total university emissions by 15% and provide about 50% of the campus’ daytime power usage requirements.
The solar farm will form part of a larger PV ecosystem already in place at the Bundoora campus. In 2021, the university installed a 519 kW solar array atop a new sports stadium constructed at the site. This followed the energisation in late 2020 of a 2.5 MW rooftop system that included an estimated 7,500 solar panels deployed across almost 25 buildings at the campus.
Other work done to improve sustainability includes installing rooftop solar panels and switching to LED lights at all campuses, installing solar carports at the Bendigo and Albury-Wodonga campuses, implementing EV chargers, transitioning the fleet to EVs, and transitioning buildings from gas to electric.
La Trobe said its four regional campuses in Bendigo, Albury-Wodonga, Shepparton and Mildura have already achieved net zero emissions status.

The estimated $652 million (USD 415 million) Silver City project, which will store excess solar and wind power in a re-purposed underground mine shaft at the Broken Hill site, will be able to deliver 200 MW of electricity for a duration of eight hours.
In a joint statement, the companies said reserve capacity of 250 MWh will be set aside to provide back-up power during network outages.
“Silver City will operate as a large energy storage asset, connected to the NSW grid and able to trade large quantities of energy on a daily basis,” they said. “It will also act as an emission-free long-term grid reliability solution for Broken Hill and the wider region, supporting existing and new renewable energy generation, and serving communities and mining loads in the most cost-effective manner.”
Martin Becker, Hydrostor’s Vice President of Business Development and Origination in Australia, said Silver City will be the company’s first operational project in Australia and will serve as a showcase for A-CAES technology.
Hydrostor’s technology features a four-step process for storing and dispatching energy. It draws off-peak or surplus energy from the grid to produce heated compressed air. During charging, heat from the compressed air is collected and stored before the cooled air displaces water out of an underground cavern up to a water reservoir on the surface. To discharge, water flows back into the cavern forcing air to the surface under pressure where it is heated with the stored thermal energy and drives a turbine to generate electricity.

The company said its technology has similar applications and benefits to pumped hydro energy storage but requires only one-20th of the volume of water that conventional pumped hydro needs per MWh of energy storage and has the added benefits of being flexible with location and topography.
“This patented technology allows grid operators to draw on clean energy, even when there is no sun to fuel solar panels and no wind to generate energy from turbines,” Hydrostor said.
While no dates have been provided for the delivery of the Silver City project, Paul Rasmussen, Hydrostor’s Vice President of Integration, said the agreement with Perilya will allow the company to accelerate the development of the facility.
“By leveraging the existing mine investment and infrastructure, this partnership enables us to improve project delivery timeframe, since we can build the underground air storage cavern much faster, with reduced set-up costs and a better understanding of the geology at site,” he said.
The agreement with Perilya includes access to property transactions and existing mine infrastructure, provision of construction support services, and supports the continued and longer-term operation of the Potosi mine during and after the project is being constructed.
The Silver City project has received development funding from the NSW government under the Emerging Energy Opportunities Program and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has conditionally approved $45 million in funding to help finance the project.
ARENA’s funding for the Silver City Project is conditional upon the project reaching financial close, which is expected to occur in late 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/28/not-all-lithium-ion-batteries-carry-the-same-risks/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2023",Not all ‘lithium-ion’ batteries carry the same risks,"From pv magazine USA
Lithium-ion battery deployment is proliferating exponentially in the U.S. Every cellphone, power tool and electric vehicle come with a lithium battery today, not to mention the 100 GWh or so of lithium batteries operating at the utility scale.
This makes a lot of consumers nervous. As this trend unfolds, stories litter the media landscape about lithium-ion batteries catching fire, and even exploding. It’s a valid concern, and the time for consumers to understand a basic truth about lithium-ion batteries is long past due.
The crucial point that’s either unknown or omitted in every one of the hundred horror stories you can find online about EV, utility and home battery fires, is that “lithium-ion” is a catch-all term. It doesn’t describe a particular type of battery. There are more than a dozen lithium-ion battery chemistries. Six of them have made it outside the laboratory. Three of them can be found on the market. Two of those are incredibly common, and the differences between them are so substantial that comparing them will serve as an excellent primer for the subject.
NMC
The first chemistry is lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide or NMC. Up until about 2020, these were the undisputed leader of the market share of lithium batteries. In 2022, they still comprised some 60% of the market share. However, after so many (largely unreported) battery fires in early models of  electric vehicles (EVs), and the subsequent shift by Tesla and a few other major EV manufacturers to the exclusive use of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry last year, this is expected to halve in short order.
NMC has an energy density roughly 10% (depending on manufacturer) better than LFP. In addition, they are significantly lighter than LFP in weight per kWh. This is largely responsible for its early adoption by industry. However, NMCs lacklustre safety record, lifespan, and its increasing material cost has recently made LFP the preferred choice of nearly every industry sector in the last year.
The dangers of lithium-ion about which the public has been so repetitiously warned, are almost exclusively the dangers of NMC. A very low thermal runaway temperature reached in many real-world scenarios is primary. With temperatures breaking records every year in most parts of the country, ambient temperatures of 110°, or even 120°F are almost commonplace now in regions that had never seen them before the 2000s.
With most of the country’s grid suffering from insufficient and decaying infrastructure, coupled with increased demand for air conditioning in hot weather, a ‘perfect storm’ is created much more commonly now wherein NMC batteries attached to utility grids (whether in a garage or a utility storage facility) are called upon to export their maximum power capacities during the hottest ambient temperatures. Thus, their (alarmingly low) thermal runaway temperatures are reached, and you get cell explosion and battery fires.
Calls for evacuations in response to the larger of these incidents, aside from risks of explosion in the immediate vicinity, are issued by fire personnel because the gas emissions during an NMC cell rupture event are extremely toxic, containing several fluorine gasses as well as cobalt and manganese cenospheres well above toxic limits.
LFP
LFP or lithium iron phosphate, also known as LiFePO4, is a completely different chemistry. With a much higher thermal runaway temperature, (some 20° C higher depending on manufacture), the potential for cell rupture due to thermal runaway is well outside of normal operating conditions, even on the hottest of days.
Further, (and it seems obvious but still bears mention) iron doesn’t burn like manganese. Actual fires due to battery failure, on those rare occasions that they do occur, are limited to wires, and sometimes battery management system (BMS) printed circuit boards. Assuming that the battery casing conforms to NEMA or IP standards, cell fires cannot escape the case unless it’s been punctured.
Also, the findings of several experiments where cell explosion is forced, have confirmed using gas chromatography that the release of gasses during a cell rupture event are by far the least toxic (containing no transition metal aerosols in contrast with NMC) of the common three lithium chemistries.
If the decarbonisation of U.S. energy infrastructure within our generation is a real goal, and not just election-cycle pillow talk, then the continued deployment of LiFePO4 batteries in tandem with the ongoing rapid deployment of solar and hydro renewable resources are absolutely paramount.
Let’s not do the public further injustice by promulgating terms like ‘lithium-ion batteries’ that for lack of distinction are turning us all away from the LFP solution that may yet afford a small chance of success, for fear of the early NMC deployment that even the profit-first-and-only markets have admitted was probably a bad idea.

This week, the project’s two managing companies – Masdar and Indonesian-headquartered electricity generator PLN Nusantara Power – agreed to expand Indonesia’s largest floating PV plant to 500 MW.
The companies did not say when the expanded, second phase of the project will be completed.
In January 2020, Masdar said it had signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara, a government-owned electric utility, to build what it claimed would be Southeast Asia’s largest floating PV project.
The project can generate 500 MW because Indonesia’s Ministry of Public Works and Housing permits up to 20% of water coverage for renewable energy, according to the press release. Masdar CEO Mohamed Jameel Ramahi claimed that the project pushes boundaries.
A recent study showed that Indonesia offers potential for floating PV on 2,719 suitable bodies of water, with 271,897 MW of potential capacity and 369,059 GWh/year of potential generation. Indonesia had 291 MW of installed solar capacity at the end of 2022, according to data collated by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
