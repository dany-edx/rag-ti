The Territory Government said in a statement the PDA provides a roadmap which would allow it to work in partnership with Sun Cable to finalise land tenure and commercial arrangements for the AAPL ahead of the project’s financial close.
Northern Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner said the signing of the PDA is a big step forward for the Territory.
“This project will put the NT on the international map when it comes to renewables,” he said. “This project will transform the Territory into a renewable energy powerhouse.”
The solar farm and battery storage facility will be built across 12,000 hectares on Powell Creek station, about 70 km southwest of Elliott, in the Northern Territory’s Barkly region. As well as the region’s climatic advantages, the facility will capitalise on close access to road and rail infrastructure.

Once operational, power from what will be Australia’s largest renewable energy infrastructure project will be exported via a high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission link connecting the precinct to the Darwin-Katherine Interconnected System (DKIS) and proposed Middle Arm Battery to be built next to the Weddell Power Station. Power will then be transported via a 3,800-km HVDC submarine cable to Singapore with the project expected to generate enough renewable electricity to power more than 3 million homes a year.
“Through the Australia-ASEAN Power Link, Sun Cable seeks to generate and transmit dispatchable, competitively-priced, renewable energy at scale,” Sun Cable managing director David Griffin said.
“This will provide affordable, reliable energy to support industrial growth in Darwin, as well as supplying up to 20% of Singapore’s electricity needs.”
It is estimated the project will inject up to $8 billion into the Territory economy with about 1,500 jobs to be created during construction and 350 ongoing positions once operations begin. Once operational, it is estimated the AAPL will export $1 billion worth of solar electricity each year.
Northern Territory Minister for Renewables and Energy Eva Lawler said the AAPL was a major success story for the territory.
“This agreement shows strong confidence for investing in the Northern Territory and investing in renewable energy, which is not only good for the environment, but good for the economy,” she said.
“Locals can look forward to affordable energy that’s reliable and renewable by the end of the decade.
“We look forward to the next steps of this exciting project.”
Sun Cable has said construction for the project will begin immediately after financial close in October 2023 with commercial operations to commence in 2027.
Since it was first announced in 2019, the AAPL has progressed rapidly. Less than one month after the project was announced it was awarded Major Project Status by the Northern Territory government. In July 2020, the Federal Government moved to fast track the project, granting it Major Project Status, recognising the project’s potential to inject billions into the economy while two of Australia’s richest people, Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest, have also lent their support.
Sun Cable has confirmed Sydney-based solar module manufacturer 5B will supply pre-fabricated, re-deployable modules for the project while Singapore based independent electricity retailer iSwitch has pledged its support to be a foundation off-taker for the solar energy produced by the project.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/28/business-council-backs-climate-change-bill/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 28, 2021",Business Council backs climate change bill,"The Business Council Australia (BCA), which represents Australia’s largest employers across industries such as energy, mining, retail, banking and manufacturing, has backed Steggall’s proposal, declaring it is a “science-based, risk-management approach” to addressing climate change which aligns with how businesses and their shareholders are responding to climate-related risks.
Steggall’s private members proposal, which was introduced to parliament last year and is now before a parliamentary inquiry, would establish an independent climate change commission and introduce risk assessment and adaptation plans.
The proposal seeks to provide a national, long-term framework for climate change mitigation and adaption which would align federal climate policy with state government and the private sector’s commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050.
In a submission to the parliamentary inquiry of Stegall’s climate action proposal, BCA chief executive Jennifer Westacott wrote the association supports “strong action” on climate change including “setting a national target of net-zero emissions by 2050 and, critically, outlining a pathway to achieve this goal”.
“The high-level policy framework outlined in the proposed legislation represents an important starting point for the development of a clearly defined, nationally guided and co-ordinated climate policy response,” she said.
Westacott said the proposed policy framework provides an architecture which will be critical to mapping out a planned and predictable approach to emissions reduction across the economy as “we work towards the net-zero target in 2050”.
“Having a very clear set of government policy ‘goal posts’ would enable company directors to focus their resources and efforts more efficiently with respect to climate-related transition risks,” she said.
“The proposed legislation adopts a science-based, risk-management approach to addressing climate change (in its objects and other sections) which is aligned with how businesses and their shareholders, increasingly, are responding to climate-related risks.”
The Federal Government has repeatedly ruled out committing to a 2050 net-zero emissions target despite international pressure to do so, saying it expects the country to reach the milestone in the second half of the 21st century.
Minister for Emissions Reductions Angus Taylor said in November that reaching net zero by 2050 “will destroy jobs, that will require taxes, that will impose costs on Australian energy consumers and raise the price of electricity”.
Steggall however said there is widespread support in the Australian community for a clear, science-based pathway to net zero.
The BCA’s submission is one of more than 6500 submissions to the inquiry and Steggall said the influx shows how broad the support is for a sensible plan to tackle emissions reduction and management of climate change risk.
“The world is heading to net zero by 2050 … it’s time Prime Minister Scott Morrison sets Australia on the right path,” she said.
“Dragging this out and delaying significant emissions reduction will only cost more and increase risks to our communities. This comes as the Coalition is once again hampered by internal party politics and its climate denying members.
“The inquiry’s two public hearings offer a significant opportunity for the public to hear from the private and public sectors on how climate change will affect our everyday lives and future, isolated from political games or election campaigns. As we have seen in the UK, climate change policy can be bipartisan.”
The two public hearings of the inquiry will be held on Friday, January 29 and Monday, February 1.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/28/real-energy-signs-jv-to-develop-large-scale-hydrogen-hubs/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,QUEENSLAND,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 28, 2021",Real Energy signs JV to develop large-scale hydrogen hubs,"Real Energy and Liberty Hydrogen have agreed to establish a joint venture company, Pure Hydrogen International, to develop a network of hydrogen manufacturing and distribution hubs – two in Queensland, and one each in New South Wales and Victoria.
Real Energy’s wholly owned offshoot Pure Hydrogen will hold a 60% stake in the Pure Hydrogen International JV in return for contributing the two Queensland projects, one at Gladstone and another at Mackay. Liberty will contribute project sites at Newcastle, NSW, and in southeast Victoria.
Real Energy managing director Scott Brown said the JV would deliver immediate scale, providing Pure Hydrogen with effective coverage of Australia’s east coast.
“We have focused on four sites that are in close proximity to ports on the east coast of Australia,” he said.
“Initially we aim to have small pilot plants at these locations to sell hydrogen fuel to local customers but as the market expands we have room to significantly expand production to include exports.”

Brown said the JV forms part of Real Energy’s plans to “rapidly assemble” in 2021 all parts of the value chain to build and develop a large-scale hydrogen business, including signing JVs with hydrogen manufacturing and distribution specialists to build pilot plants at the hubs and locking in agreements with potential end-users.
“Pure Hydrogen has made excellent progress in a short period of time and we are only just getting started,” Brown said.
“We look forward to delivering a steady stream of project development news early in 2021 as our four hydrogen hubs progress.”
The JV agreement follows Real Energy’s announcement earlier this month of a memorandum of understanding with US-based Hyzon Motors. That collaboration will include the development of a network of hydrogen refuelling stations across Australia and the provision of Hyzon’s hydrogen-powered commercial vehicles.
Real Energy’s focus is timely given the international demand for hydrogen and fuel-cell technology is accelerating.
The latest forecasts from Deloitte show the global market for hydrogen is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.8% to USD $180.2 billion by 2025 with approximately 45% of production to come from the Asia Pacific.
Modelling by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has forecast Australian hydrogen exports are expected to contribute $1.7 billion in Australia’s economy by 2030.
Brown said hydrogen has the potential to be a complete “game-changer” for Australia’s energy roadmap.
“The potential for scale when it comes to Australian hydrogen is immense, particularly given the burgeoning rise of forecast hydrogen markets in the Asia Pacific and mounting interest in the North American region,” Brown said.
“Pure Hydrogen is well placed to capitalise on this by continuing to fast-track Australia’s hydrogen and fuel-cell technology infrastructure.
“As more and more countries around the world transition to low-carbon energy sources, Real has a fantastic opportunity to be a leader in sustainable hydrogen technology production and exports and the four new hydrogen hubs can help pave the way forward for Australia’s hydrogen future.”

Geni.Energy is one company that knows the only way to kill off fossil fuels is renewables like solar (look at Bluewaters in WA).
What is Geni.Energy doing to secure the future of the Northwest?  
Geni.Energy: We’re creating a renewable energy future for the Northwest maximising local benefits. Our rural communities do need jobs and new investment, and renewables can bring exciting, sustainable jobs to our region.
While the New South Wales (NSW) and Federal Governments recently gave the green light to the project (Santos’ gas fields), this has not dampened our mission to transition our region to renewables. More short-term fossil fuel projects, like the Narrabri Gas Project, is not something our region, or the planet, needs.
These community-led initiatives create local benefits by introducing long-term employment and skills to the region. Some modelling work done by the University of Technology Sydney found that the Narrabri Shire could create at least 622 MW of solar and 175 MW of wind generation, creating up to 500 construction jobs and estimates that by 2030 the Narrabri Shire would need around 430 solar and 50 wind workers.
Why is it so important to switch retailers?  
Switching your retailer is the simplest and easiest way to send a clear message to your energy retailer that you do not support a future led by fossil fuels. People exercising their power through their purchasing choices has long been a powerful way to enact change. Energy retailers are particularly susceptible to what their customers are thinking. You can let your energy provider know that you don’t support their ownership of the Narrabri gas project, or that you do not support the use of domestic gas, or that you want your electricity sourced from renewable energy.
Fortunately, you do have a low carbon emission option now thanks to our partnership with Enova Energy.  Our Switch For Narrabri campaign lets NSW residents make the switch to an energy retailer whose energy is sourced sustainably through renewables. Enova Energy, who are also a community-led organisation, currently source over 60% of their energy from their own customers’ rooftop solar and purchase carbon credits for the rest of their energy as they work towards 100 percent renewables.
By making the switch you are also helping our not-for-profit too. We receive a commission on all switches to Enova through our website. So you will be directly supporting a renewable future for the northwest at the same time as changing to Enova.
You can help create the future that you want to see us living in. This is not something remote, you can make choices that mean renewables are our preferred source of energy.
The NSW Government’s new energy roadmap sets out five Renewable Energy Zones (REZs), but stressed that these are just the ‘first five’. It is my understanding that you guys at Geni reckon the Northwest has all the potential of an REZ-in-waiting?  
The Northwest of NSW is planned to become a NSW Regional Energy Zone in 2030. But to be honest, we can’t wait that long.
The Northwest Renewable Energy Precinct that Geni.Energy is creating does not need to be part of a REZ. It utilises the current network poles and wires, creating energy that can be used locally, without the need for expensive transmission upgrades.
Our Virtual Power Plant (VPP) allows households to generate excess electricity, stored in hundreds of small batteries to be used by our neighbours when it is needed. Our community is already deciding that they want to be a REZ and we invite the government to come along with us sooner than 2030.

Part of the potential of the Northwest Regional Energy Precinct is, as you said, that it doesn’t require major infrastructural upgrades, how can this be done?  
That’s right, the Northwest Regional Energy Precinct utilises current technologies and current infrastructure.  Stage one engages local homeowners in the VPP, with Stage Two looking at larger scale generators.
We currently have a project in Walgett, to the west of Narrabri where the local Aboriginal Medical Service is installing 143 kW of rooftop solar in partnership with Planet Ark Power. This project will save the community around $1.5 million and 4,500 tonnes of CO2 over the 25 year life span of the panels. Generators like this, use the energy themselves during the day and provide it to the VPP on weekends.
Renewable Energy technologies give us these wonderful opportunities towards energy independence. Meeting our own needs first and foremost, and our neighbours needs secondly, means we do not need major infrastructure upgrades.
The renewable industry has the potential to create some of the same negative impacts that our communities are suffering from due to fossil fuel projects. These are massive projects with massive impacts, and yet the majority of good they do is toward international companies or city-based executives.
But, renewables also have the potential, if done right, to create significant local benefits. Part of that is about appropriate scale – 100 small scale generators can create the same electricity as one large scale generator.
Geni.Energy prides itself on being a community-owned not-for-profit business, how is Geni integrated with the community?  
Geni.Energy was birthed from the community need for jobs, balanced with the community need to protect our water and land resources. It is a not-for-profit entity and we are powered by a range of volunteers and community members.
Being motivated purely by community benefit has allowed many doors to be opened to Geni.Energy. We have been able to swiftly develop trust with other organisations in the not-for-profit space such as Enova Community Energy and Planet Ark Power.
We have partnered with Enova Energy to provide retail energy services to locals.  We partnered with Planet Ark Power on our project with the Walgett community as they move towards a low carbon future.
A large portion of our team is also made up by some generous volunteers who have lent their hands and knowledge – with a few already from off-grid systems. We regularly hold information sessions and events such as our recent People Powering People night for our Geni.Mates. Geni.Mates are those who have shown support through various methods of volunteer, community engagement and staying up-to-date through constant involvement with our organisation. You can sign up to become a Geni.Mate too!
It is crucial that our community takes a seat at the table on this transition to ensure the benefits stay local.
Geni.Energy has a range of solar + battery options. The main hindrance to energy storage uptake in Australia is still the long payback times on batteries, is this something your customers are concerned with? Or do other advantages of owning a solar + battery systems obviate the concern for payback time?  
Very few customers are concerned with the payback period – which is only going to get shorter! We start by undertaking a thorough analysis of each customer’s bills and current energy usage.  We are then able to design a solar + battery system that is right for their needs.
Through assessing their energy, we can estimate their pay-back period. Some customers have as short as a four year payback period, with many others having a five or six year payback on their system. Our partner, Enopte, who supplies the batteries, provides a 10 year warranty so our customers are already ahead. The design of the batteries is highly modular, making gradual replacement over time possible.

Our system also includes an Energy Management System that gives the customer a high level of control over their energy consumption and how and when they charge their batteries.  They love the feeling of independence this gives them.
Our batteries allow customers to keep the lights on during blackouts too, another great incentive in areas like ours where we get quite a few blackouts.
Ultimately, each customer has their own reasons for investing in a battery – whether that be to save money, control their energy use or reduce their carbon footprint, their concerns with payback periods will differ.
Obviously the Northwest has a lot of farmland, is rooftop installation the most popular? Or are customers installing ground-fixed systems in spare paddocks?
There is a lot of interest in ground mounted systems and how farms can best utilise solar. The challenge is that farm energy use is highly seasonal, with irrigation highly tied to the availability of water.  So that is why our regional approach is so crucial, so when the energy is not needed on farm, it can find a home with other businesses or homes that need it.
What does 2021 hold in store for Geni.Energy and the Narrabri Renewable Energy Precinct?  
2021 is going to be huge! Our VPP pilot phase will launch in March and we expect to go full blown in July, which is when we will really start to see the benefits flow.  Part of our outcomes include the growth of skills in the region, so creating a constant flow of new solar + battery installs will see those people being attracted to the region.  We are looking forward to helping our agricultural industry maximise the benefits of cheap green energy too!

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/28/fimer-unveils-two-new-three-phase-string-inverters/,"INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,NEW ZEALAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 28, 2021",Fimer unveils two new three-phase string inverters,"From pv magazine Global.
Italy-based inverter manufacturer Fimer is preparing to launch two new string inverters for applications in residential, commercial and industrial PV projects.
The two inverters, which were labeled PVS-10/12.5/15-TL and PVS-20/30/33-TL, have a power output ranging from 10 to 33 kW and are claimed to reach an input voltage of 1100 V (DC).
The most powerful devices of the series have been developed to deal with increasing PV module currents, as in the case of bifacial modules, the manufacturer said, noting that both inverters feature current monitoring on each string allowing for longer strings as well as the ability to operate across wider temperature ranges.
The two devices also feature potential induced degradation (PID) prevention and an integrated zero-export system, which the producer said delivers savings on BoS and removes the need for expensive additional devices. “Integrated wifi/ethernet for TCP/IP networking allows for cost efficient networking and off-the-shelf replacements,” Fimer further explained. “And, for retrofit applications, the inverter range offers unique DC-side flexibility.”
The two inverters are also said to allow for quick installation, easy handling and maintenance and fast commissioning through the company’s dedicated app.
The new three-phase inverter range will be available in Australia and New Zealand from April 2021. At this point it is unclear whether the higher current products compatible with bifacial modules will be part of the Antipodean range, or if such heights are necessary in the 10-33 kW market, but more details on the products will be officially unveiled later this month.
Mostly known for its central inverter business, Fimer announced plans to enter the string inverter business in 2018.
