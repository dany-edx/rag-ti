The policy is vital if the Labor government is to meet its 43% emissions reduction target by 2030, and as the Liberal National Coalition decided it would not support the reforms, the Greens and crossbench now hold deciding votes.
Greens leader Adam Bandt says his party has “huge concerns” with parts of the Safeguard Mechanism scheme, including the use of offsets and the low emissions reduction targets. Nonetheless, the Greens say they are prepared to put those concerns aside if Labor agrees to stop opening new coal and gas projects.
Such a moratorium could be realised via an amendment to the safeguard legislation, or a new “climate trigger” in environmental law.

“Labor needs the Greens to get this through Parliament,” Bandt said. “If Labor’s scheme falls over, it will be because Labor wants to open new coal and gas mines.”
Unsurprisingly, fears about a new era of climate wars and “history repeating itself” have followed the Greens’ resolution.
The government wants the Safeguard Mechanism reforms in place by July 2023, but federal Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen has repeatedly said the government will not agree to a moratorium on new coal and gas.

Such a moratorium would affect over 100 coal and gas projects the Department of Industry, Resources and Energy has recorded as being either in development or under consideration.
Many of these projects amount to small expansions, but some like the Scarborough and Browse gas developments in Western Australia are set to become the biggest in the country.
“You can’t put the fire out while pouring petrol on it. The first step to fixing a problem is to stop making the problem worse,” Bandt said.
Recent data from the Australian Electoral Commission found at least $1.35 million (USD 940,000) in fossil fuel money flowed to the Labor, Liberal and Nationals parties.

The valuation of the combined company is expected to land in the range of $440 million to $840 million (USD 305 million – 586 million). 
The proposed deal would provide funds for Vast Solar to move forward with its Australian concentrated solar thermal power (CSP) projects, and to deploy the technology overseas.

Vast Solar’s CSP technology uses mirrors to concentrate and capture heat from the sun in solar receivers, with high temperature heat transferred via liquid sodium and stored in molten salt. The stored energy can then be used to heat water to create steam to drive a turbine, providing baseload electricity.
Vast Solar just received $65 million from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) to construct a commercial CSP plant north of Port Augusta in South Australia known as VS1. It has also recently been granted roughly $40 million from HyGATE, a collaboration between the Australian and German governments, for its Solar Methanol 1 project.
Under the proposed partnership, Vast Solar will remain headquartered in Australia but will shorten its name to “Vast” as a combined entity.
The move has deliberately sought access to overseas capital with Vast’s CEO Craig Wood telling the Australian Financial Review: “The US capital markets are just deeper than what’s available in Australia, which both now and in the medium to longer term plays into things.”
The outlet reported Vast Solar’s current owner, AGCentral, owned by Johnny Kahlbetzer, will put an additional $21.6 million of new equity into the combined company, as will Nabors.

The total 42 MW battery systems will supply power to Fortescue’s new Iron Bridge operations, and will eventually store energy from a planned 150 MW solar farm to be built nearby.  
As it stands, the battery systems are intended to ensure network stability, with HSA saying “the batteries’ primary role is for grid stability and support, providing spinning reserve backup to any gas generation outages or sudden changes in the solar output.”
The battery systems are among the largest installed at a network-connected mining site.

Mike Hall, Executive Director of Hybrid Systems Australia, said the project represented one of the largest and most technologically advanced BESS projects the company had undertaken. HSA partnered with Hitachi Energy and Kokam on the project.
The decarbonisation of mining operations has become a major theme, primarily in Western Australia and Queensland where most of Australia’s mining operations are located.
Mining companies like Fortescue are increasingly turning to renewable technologies to power their operations, which are usually in remote and regional areas. 
Australian modular solar manufacturer 5B recently announced its technology would be used in a 95 MW hybrid power plant featuring solar, wind and battery energy storage at the Liontown Resources’ Kathleen Valley Lithium Project being developed in the Goldfields region of WA.
The uptake of batteries and solar for mining applications is turning out to be a major driver for Australia’s domestic renewables industry, with miners increasingly turning to renewables to supply cheaper, cleaner power that also boosts the extractive industries’ ESG credentials.

The project aims to both store the town’s excess solar and free up more than 2,000 kW of solar hosting capacity. This hosting capacity is expected to be made available to customers in May, 2023.
The installation is part of Horizon Power’s $31 million (USD 21.4 million) Energy Storage in Regional Towns project, funded by the state government’s WA Recovery Plan. The program has already seen similar batteries commissioned in the Western Australian towns of Wiluna, Yalgoo, Carnarvon and Marble Bar. 
Broome will be the next town to receive a battery, with commissioning expected to start in the next few months. The towns of Yungngora, Fitzroy Crossing, and Halls Creek are also in line for battery installations under the program.
The sizes of the batteries vary depending on the different needs of each region, Horizon Power told pv magazine Australia. In Exmouth, the battery is 3500kVA / 4,464kWh.
Horizon Power says that combined, the nine battery systems will allow more than 1,000 households and 500 businesses to connect rooftop solar systems, which until now has not been possible due to grid stability concerns.
Horizon Power operates one of the world’s most dispersed electricity networks, and has been revising how it connects its regional customers and towns for some time now, moving towards a distributed network of embedded microgrids and stand-alone power systems.
It has also been trying to answer customer demand for solar hosting capacity, which the utility says has grown dramatically in recent years, through a number of means. One of those is via this series of batteries, which were initially designed back in 2020 and are now nearing completion.
In total, Horizon Power’s Energy Storage in Regional Towns project will provide more than 10 MW of extra rooftop solar for regional towns and is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 13,000 tonnes a year.
While such utility-owned batteries are not what commonly comes to mind under the banner of “community batteries,” they in fact deliver on many of the results communities are hoping for. That is, increased rooftop solar hosting and grid export capacity, widening access to local clean generation, and greater energy resilience.
There are a number of community battery models being trialled and tested across Australia, with varying levels of success, as pv magazine Australia recently covered.

In August 2022, US President Joe Biden signed the $369 billion Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law and changed the face of the global energy transition.
The IRA is the largest climate and energy spending package in US history. The bill not only expands incentives to deploy clean energy toward emissions reduction goals, but includes new production incentives for domestic solar, wind and battery manufacturing.
Much like Australia, political polarisation in the US delayed clear policy to mitigate climate change and drive the transition to renewables. But now the sleeping giant has awoken and sparked an international clean energy arms race that few, if any, will be able to keep up with.
Race for renewables
In a period of global energy crisis and a decade of desperation when it comes to concrete action to mitigate the effects of climate change, the IRA is a cause to rejoice.
But as Australia’s Clean Energy Council Chief Executive Kane Thornton put it: “It is immediately clear the US package dwarfs the level of support Australian governments provide for the clean energy transition.”
“The consequences of inaction have the potential to damage Australian competitiveness across all industries for decades to come,” Thornton added.
European leaders have made a similar realisation. After years bemoaning the lack of climate leadership from the US without making significant moves of its own, the European Union is now bemoaning the US having taken the lead.
On Feb. 1, 2023, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen responded to the IRA with the $272 billion Green Deal Industrial Plan. “We only have a small window to invest in clean technology and innovation and to become leaders before the fossil fuel economy is over,” von der Leyen said.
The clean energy policy arms race sparked by the IRA means governments around the world can no longer excuse their inaction by pointing to the action of major emitters like the US and China. But now that excuse no longer holds. Indeed, pv magazine has learned of rumors in China that the government is looking to ramp up PV installations from 122 GW in 2022 to around 160 GW in 2023.
Thornton noted that US spending was positive for decarbonisation, but recognised that US incentives mean Australia now faces losing thousands of jobs and significant international investment to its closest ally.
“Australia has a prime opportunity to become a clean energy superpower,” continued Thornton, “but the brightest minds and the biggest wallets are now looking to the US for their best opportunity.”
Thornton is calling for the Australian federal government to respond to the IRA in its May Budget with a coherent masterplan and vast economic investment to prioritise the construction of renewable energy and storage, or risk dropping even further behind.
Ryan Carroll, a regional director at STEM workforce solutions provider Airswift, said the Australian government should “learn from Joe Biden and use the May Budget to promote investment and entrepreneurship. This will signal to the top energy minds that Australia is the place for career progression and innovative projects.”
Make or break
The Covid-19 pandemic and its run-on impacts throughout global supply chains demonstrated the benefits of domestic manufacturing. But now IRA incentives are attracting global manufacturers to the US and the likes of Australia and Europe are learning, as Shakespeare put it, that “delays have dangerous ends.”
Nevertheless, Australia’s long dormant clean energy manufacturing industry is showing small signs of life. The Albanese government’s proposed National Reconstruction Fund aims to boost investment in inshore manufacturing, including the production of solar panels, batteries and hydrogen electrolysers, and is now on the verge of parliament.
The government has earmarked up to $3 billion of the NRF’s initial $15 billion to support renewables and low-emission technologies.
On Feb. 6, US-based solar tracker provider Array Technologies announced plans to set up manufacturing operations in Australia.
In July 2022, Australia’s sole solar panel manufacturer, Tindo Solar, unveiled its new $11 million production facility in Adelaide. In December 2022, Tindo announced a doubling of sales in both panels and battery storage.
The company said the boost came off the back of rising energy costs and increased consumer awareness of the benefits of buying quality and buying locally.
While there are critics who argue the IRA is a protectionist policy that will trigger a “race to the bottom” in which governments compete with evermore favorable incentives to attract clean energy manufacturers and multinational companies. few could argue the pre-IRA status quo was much better.
In fact, judging by the international reaction the IRA is already proving beneficial in kicking laggardly governments and investors into gear. The US has ignited the race for green power, and now it’s make or break time for trade blocs like the EU and trade partners like Australia.
