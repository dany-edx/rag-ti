Fortescue Energy Chief Executive Officer Mark Hutchinson said the proposed electrolyser supply contract “is another step towards fulfilling our ambition to make a final investment decision on the project this calendar year.”
“We believe there is strong demand globally for the green hydrogen we will produce, and we must move quickly to meet that demand,” he said.
The proposed 550 MW electrolyser supply contract is subject to final negotiations and approvals and Fortescue’s final investment decision on the Gibson Island project.
Hutchinson said that decision is expected by the end of 2023.
Once operational, the plant is expected to be capable of producing up to 70,000 tonnes of green hydrogen annually, which would then be converted into approximately 385,000 tonnes of green ammonia for domestic and export markets.
In addition to the electrolyser supply deal, Fortescue and Plug Power have also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to investigate opportunities to collaborate on large-scale green hydrogen projects on a global basis. This could include equity trades in Fortescue’s proposed Phoenix hydrogen hub and in Plug Power’s Texas hydrogen plant.
Under the terms of the MOU, the two companies will also evaluate the potential supply of a range of equipment including electrolysers, liquefiers, tanker trailers and stationary storage tanks for green hydrogen production projects in North America.
The new agreement comes after Plug Power last year walked away from building an electrolyser manufacturing plant near Gladstone in Queensland with Fortescue.
The two companies had signed a letter of intent to create a 50-50 joint venture to build a ‘gigafactory’, aiming to manufacture 2 GW of hydrogen electrolysers annually, but Plug Power abandoned the plans.
Fortescue has continued with the project using its own electrolyser technology and Hutchinson said the company remains willing to work with Plug Power, saying the two companies share a common mission to build out and scale up a global green hydrogen ecosystem.
“It is vital that first movers like Plug Power and Fortescue continue to work together to develop and scale-up the green energy and green hydrogen industries in Australia and North America,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/12/accc-sounds-fresh-warning-for-lg-branded-home-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,QUALITY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 12, 2023",ACCC sounds fresh warning for LG-branded home batteries,"The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) says all households with a solar storage system need to urgently check if the system has a recalled LG-branded battery installed, warning they should switch off all affected batteries immediately.
“When these batteries malfunction there is a serious risk of injury or death due to the affected batteries overheating and causing a fire,” the ACCC said.
LG first issued a recall in February 2021 for an estimated 7,200 of the affected batteries which were installed primarily in LG, SolaX or Opal branded home energy storage systems.
The scope of the recall has since been expanded several times and the manufacturer is now instructing all consumers with affected LG batteries in their solar energy storage system – which include LG-branded RESU systems, SolaX Power Station, SolaX X-Cabinet, Opal Storage, Redback SH5000, Red Earth Sunrise, Red Earth Drop Bear, Eguana Evolve and VARTA Pulse Neo – to immediately switch their energy storage system off and to keep it switched off until they are fixed or replaced.
“It is critically important that anyone with a solar energy storage system checks their battery’s serial number, as this recall has been updated to include new models, affected systems and dates of manufacture,” ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said.
“Even if you don’t have an LG-branded solar storage system, you may still have an LG-branded battery that has been recalled. For peace of mind, check your system again and turn off your battery straight away if it has been recalled.”
The warning for Australian battery owners comes amid reports of a spate of battery fires in Europe that have been linked to LG-branded batteries.
Australian consumers with affected batteries should contact LG or SolaX to arrange remediation of the battery.
LG will replace recalled batteries free of charge. Alternatively, consumers can opt for a refund and have the recalled battery removed from their property at no cost. Households who have higher electricity bills as a result of not being able to use their battery as expected will also be compensated by LG, the ACCC said.
The recalled batteries were available for sale at various times between April 2017 and December 2019. The affected models are RESU3.3, RESU6.5, RESU10, RESU13, RESU7H Type-R, RESU10H Type-C, RESU10H Type-R, RESU10H Type-R (Secondary), S/A Gen2 1P (EM048063P3S2), S/A Gen2 1P (EM048063P3S4), S/A Gen2 1P (EM048063P3S5), S/A Gen2 2P (EM048126P3S7), and S/A Gen2 2P (EM048126P3S8).

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/12/endeavour-to-roll-out-smart-meters-after-regulator-approves-waiver/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 12, 2023",Endeavour to roll out smart meters after regulator approves waiver,"Endeavour Energy will install about 5,600 smart meters across New South Wales (NSW) after the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) granted the distributed network service provider a ‘trial waiver’ that exempts the time-limited project from existing rules.
Endeavour said the 30-month trial is expected to improve the delivery of load management services that reduce electricity consumption at peak periods and lower electricity network costs for trial participants.
“This new approach will give customers greater control over their electricity use and allow them to soak up excess solar power generated in the middle of the day to heat hot water, helping lower their electricity bills,” it said.
AER Chair Clare Savage said the rollout of smart meter upgrades presents significant benefits for both consumers and industry.
“This trial can help consumers reduce their electricity bills through access to new products and tariffs, better integrated technology and improved understanding of their energy use,” she said.
The trial waiver is the first granted through the Energy Innovation Toolkit, an online platform designed to help energy businesses explore their options when launching new projects and programs under existing frameworks.
Savage said the waiver was approved under new powers that allow the AER to temporarily exempt eligible projects from having to comply with specified laws and rules.
“Through the Energy Innovation Toolkit we are making it easier for innovators to launch their energy ideas and test new business models in a real-world environment, without risk of negatively disrupting the market,” she said.
The trial waiver will allow exempt Endeavour from current regulations which dictate that retailers are responsible for the installation of smart meters with distributed network service providers only able to initiate metering upgrades after being notified that the existing meter is faulty.
The trial waiver will allow Endeavour – which owns, maintains and operates the electrical distribution network supplying more than 2.6 million people in households and businesses across Sydney’s Greater West, Blue Mountains, Southern Highlands the Illawarra and the South Coast – to “initiate the meter swap in circumstances where there is no genuine metering fault.”
The regulator said the trial is subject to a range of conditions including consumer protection measures and reporting requirements.
Endeavour has appointed Intellihub, the smart meter company owned by Canada’s Brookfield and Australian firm Pacific Equity Partners, as its metering coordinator to undertake the meter replacements but one of the conditions of the trial waiver requires the distributor to allow a participant’s retailer to appoint their preferred metering coordinator, provided it can deliver the services within the planned timeframe and for a price agreed between Endeavour and the retailer.
The AER said lessons learnt from the trial will help the regulator better understand the impacts of distribution businesses rolling out smart meters with the learnings to be shared publicly at its conclusion of the trial in 2025.

There were multiple reports of fires involving batteries connected to residential PV systems in Germany and Austria in September. Pv magazine has learned about five such incidents in the latter half of the month, with three occurring in Germany and two in Austria.
The most recent incident occurred on Sept. 29 in Kleinkahl, Germany. According to the fire department report, a single-family home experienced heavy smoke due to a technical malfunction that blew up the power storage unit of a PV system. The incident report stated that the room housing the electricity storage unit was affected.
Firefighters initially extinguished the blaze, while safely cooling the battery in a container to prevent reignition. High-performance fans were used to clear toxic fire smoke from the house. Although no one was injured, the residence is currently uninhabitable due to extensive smoke and soot damage.
Images from the fire brigade suggest that the battery may have been a product from South Korean manufacturer LG. This would make it similar basement fire in Kochel am See, Germany, on Sept. 19.
“In the basement, a heavily smoking battery was discovered in the technical room, presumably from a PV system,” said the Kochel department. “The battery was disconnected and transported outside.”
It was then submerged in water in a steel container outdoors and cooled. The residents were not at home at the time of the incident. In this case too, no people were harmed.
A third incident occurred on Sept. 26 in Ehrenfriedersdorf, Germany. The fire department provided medical care to two individuals and a nearby highway had to be shut down as a result. It did not disclose any details regarding the origin of the storage unit.
Austria, meanwhile, was also hit by a number of solar-related fires around the same time. One incident occurred on Sept. 24 in an allotment garden settlement in Altach, Austria. When firefighters arrived, they found a shelter and an attached building fully engulfed in flames, along with an agricultural transport vehicle inside the shelter.
The fire department quickly extinguished the fire, with no injuries reported. The cause of the fire was determined to be a defective PV battery storage unit at the rear of the caravan.
On the same day, the Feldkirchen fire department in Carinthia, Austria, responded to a cellar fire. The storage model involved in this incident is not clear from the pictures taken by the emergency services. According to a local media report, residents of the home were awakened by a loud bang just before midnight, and the basement of the house caught fire.
The report suggests that the fire may have been caused by a short circuit in a PV system that ignited the batteries. One resident was taken to the Klagenfurt Clinic for smoke inhalation.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/12/new-reforms-liberalised-energy-market-help-untap-philippines-solar-potential/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,PHILIPPINES",ANGELA SKUJINS,"OCTOBER 12, 2023","New reforms, liberalised energy market help untap Philippines’ solar potential","From pv magazine Global
A perfect storm is brewing in the Philippines – comprising a combination of legislative reform and an extremely liberal market – making the country the most attractive of Southeast Asian nations for developing solar PV projects, Moritz Sticher, senior advisor of Berlin-based cleantech advisory company Apricum, told pv magazine.
“The Philippine market is the only liberal energy market in ASEAN and the only one with a spot market, the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM),” he said. “If you go to Thailand, it’s the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT); if you go to Vietnam, it’s Vietnam Electricity (ENV); if you go to Indonesia, it’s Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) and so forth. These are state-run and align with the military mostly – sometimes not – but the degree of freedom to operate in this market is not there for private sector players, simply because of these monopolies.”
Recent changes to foreign ownership laws have positively impacted the market, Sticher said, leading to increased activity. “The limitation on foreign ownership in the Philippines for renewable energy assets was removed in December last year, which further spurred the growth in C&I,” he said.
The Philippines’ Department of Energy enforced changes to the Renewable Energy Act in December, removing rules around 100% Filipino ownership of certain renewable energy assets. “Mostly locals” are winning these new government tenders, Sticher said, with projects expected to be delivered next year.
However, obstacles remain, the analyst added, including a lack of government-built infrastructure. “Transmission lines don’t go [up] from one day to the other so there would be years, one or two years [before connection],” he said, warning if the government lagged on developing infrastructure it could lead to market “stagnation.” Sticher added that the Philippines’ archipelagic geography – it comprises 7,640 islands – poses another challenge, as the country lacks a ‘developed grid’ which makes it difficult to connect large-scale solar PV plants to the network.
Sticher also said the Philippines’ government regulatory framework surrounding C&I permits is not as complex compared to other ASEAN countries, such as Thailand, “and there seems to be no threat of limiting this segment through regulations, such as frequently seen in other ASEAN countries, mostly pursued by the respective state-owned utilities.”
Overall, he is confident that: “The Philippines in general is a place to do solar energy. If I were to develop a project right now, I would do a project in the Philippines.”
The comments come off the back of the Philippines’ first canal-top solar irrigation project coming online, as well as recent numerous plans to develop floating solar PV arrays in the region being trumpeted.
The Philippines aims to install 15 GW of clean energy by 2030, with a possible focus on mini-grids and standalone clean power systems due to the country’s archipelagic nature, according to a 2022 report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
