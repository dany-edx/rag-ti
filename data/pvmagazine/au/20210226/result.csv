The tour was part of the newly-appointed Shadow Minister’s process of familiarising himself with the industry and stakeholders in his new portfolio. Bowen described himself as excited about the appointment. “Love it,” he told pv magazine Australia.
“I want to see more manufacturing in Australia, more activity created in Australia… every step is ones that creates jobs. This is really where we have to take the conversation in Australia,” the Shadow Minister said.
One Stop’s Sydney warehouse, currently the biggest 100% solar distribution warehouse in Australia, is actually located in Bowen’s electorate. “I didn’t realised the biggest solar distributor was here in my electorate – it’s very good news,” he said.

Coming from a background in finance, having served as the Shadow Treasurer from 2013 to 2019, Bowen’s focus is definitively on the economic potential of growing Australia’s renewables industry.
“In the regions, areas which traditionally make energy in other ways, there are great solar farm and wind turbine opportunities. We need to do more of it,” he said.
Wayne Smith from the Smart Energy Council was also on the One Stop Warehouse tour and told pv magazine Australia that his team have had a number of meetings with Bowen since his appointment little over four weeks ago.
Bowen also recently visited Solar Power Nation’s Sydney warehouse, and plans to visit Victoria and Queensland in the coming weeks to familiarise himself with the renewable companies and projects there.
Labor state-governments, including the McGowan government in Western Australia, Palaszczuk in Queensland, and Andrews in Victoria – as well as Liberal-run governments in New South Wales and South Australia – have all put renewables front and centre of Covid recovery plans. The successful formula seems to be one Bowen plans to emulate.
As numerous industries have ground to a devastating halt because of the global pandemic, renewables not only came out of 2020 unscathed, but are positively booming. Figures from the Clean Energy Regulator in January revealed Australia made new records in renewable capacity in 2020, adding 2.6 GW of rooftop PV.
Likewise, One Stop Warehouse sold 600 MW of solar products in 2020. The company’s Co-Founder and CEO, Anson Zhang, also owns Discover Energy, an energy retailer, which added 10,000 new customers in the last year. Bowen said Zhang’s companies’ growth displays the potential for renewables to not only create regional jobs, but suburban ones too.
As Australia’s largest business-to-business solar distributor, One Stop Warehouse told pv magazine Australia residential solar accounted for about 60% of its business, where 40% was driven by commercial projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/26/worlds-biggest-solar-farm-added-to-infrastructure-australia-priority-list/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 26, 2021",World’s biggest solar farm added to Infrastructure Australia priority list,"The world’s biggest solar and storage project has taken another step towards realisation with the planned 13 GW solar farm and 27 GWh battery storage facility recognised by the Australian Government’s independent infrastructure advisor, Infrastructure Australia.
The project, which would generate, store and transmit solar energy to domestic and international markets, was on Friday included on Infrastructure Australia’s annual Infrastructure Priority Initiative List.
In announcing the project’s inclusion, Infrastructure Australia acknowledged the potential for large-scale solar generation to transform the energy landscape in northern Australia and declared the Northern Territory has a distinct advantage when it comes to utility scale renewable energy projects, highlighting the territory’s large land mass, solar resource and proximity to energy intense markets in the Indo-Pacific region.
“There is an opportunity to harness this advantage by developing large-scale, dispatchable renewable energy generation in the Northern Territory, with transmission infrastructure to supply domestic and export markets,” Infrastructure Australia wrote.
The proposed Australia-ASEAN Power Link includes a 13 GW solar farm to be developed on a 12,000-hectare site at Powell Creek, near Elliott in the NT. This would be coupled with 27 GWh of battery storage at the solar farm, in Darwin and in Singapore.
The project is expected to supply power to the Darwin region and to Singapore via a 4,500 km high-voltage direct-current transmission network, including a 750-kilometre overhead transmission line from the solar farm to Darwin and a 3,800km submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore, via Indonesia.

Sun Cable said it was “delighted” the project has been added to the priority list and said its inclusion is consistent with the 2019 Australian Infrastructure Audit, which found Australia could develop new industries based on renewable energy, including large-scale solar and wind.
“There is an opportunity to harness abundant renewable energy resources for domestic electricity supply, growing Australia’s capacity to contribute to the whole global value chain of renewable electricity, including zero emissions manufacturing, as well as creating an intercontinental renewable electricity transmission export industry for Australia,” Sun Cable CEO David Griffin said.
“Sun Cable’s vision is to create a world-class renewable electricity grid across the Indo-Pacific region, which will decouple economic growth from global greenhouse gas emissions.”
Northern Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner welcomed the inclusion of large-scale solar generation on the priority project list, claiming the project will see up to $8 billion invested in the Territory.
“(It) will make the Territory a renewable energy superpower,” he said.
“Renewable energy from Sun Cable delivered at scale into Darwin will be the catalyst for growth in existing and emerging industries, including low-emissions manufacturing and zero-emissions data centres and digital services.”
The announcement comes just weeks after Sun Cable signed a Project Development Agreement (PDA) with the Northern Territory Government. The Australia-ASEAN Power Link has also been afforded Major Project Status by the Australian and Northern Territory governments.
Sun Cable said it will now pursue the next stage of the process with Infrastructure Australia, identifying the proposed solution and providing details including the business case.
The Singapore-based company said it is working on a Territory Benefits Plan and predicted the 70-year project would create about 1500 jobs during construction and 350 during operations.
Sun Cable said financial close is expected in late 2023, with the first electricity to Darwin by 2026 and Singapore from 2027.

The Sun Cable solar project is one of 44 initiatives included on Infrastructure Australia’s 2021 Infrastructure Priority List.
The provision of dispatchable energy storage for firming capacity in the National Electricity Market (NEM) has been included among the High Priority Initiatives.
Noting the transition to a new electricity mix in the grid, Infrastructure Australia said the NEM will require significant investments in dispatchable energy storage to support growing renewable energy generation and the future retirement of coal-fired generators.
The expansion of Renewable Energy Zones (REZ) has also been included on the High Priority list with Infrastructure Australia declaring the NEM will require significant new grid-scale renewable energy generators to replace retiring thermal generation facilities.
Future connectivity and reliability of the NEM has also been included on the High Priority list with Infrastructure Australia noting the NEM “is undergoing a once-in-a-lifetime transition from thermal generation to intermittent renewables, such as wind and solar, complemented by firming generation (such as pumped hydro)”.
“By 2035, significant investment will be needed in renewable and firming generation and associated transmission to continue providing affordable, reliable and secure energy for users,” the independent statutory body wrote.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) forecast in its 2020 Integrated System Plan (ISP) that by 2040 more than 26 GW of large-scale renewable energy, backed up with up to 19 GW of new dispatchable resources, will be required to replace retiring coal-fired generation.
Infrastructure Australia said to ensure an orderly and cost-efficient transition, the transmission grid will need augmentation to balance generation resources and connect REZs.
“Approximately 22 GW of new connection capacity is required in REZs by 2040 to meet this growing need,” the statutory body wrote.

NSW Energy minister Matt Kean unveiled the RESB on Tuesday, describing it as an opportunity to secure an economic opportunity for local renewable industries in line with the Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap.
“We have bought all the key players to the table to make sure we don’t miss any opportunities to support local jobs and industry as we modernise the state’s energy infrastructure over the coming decades,” he said in a statement.
“My brief to the board is do not leave any stone unturned. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to secure the economic and employment benefits under our Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap for our local industries, workers and consumers.”
The RESB will focus on material sourcing and contracting arrangements, with an eye to giving NSW manufacturers, particularly those in the regions, a competitive edge in emerging ‘green’ supply industries.
It will be jointly chaired by Daniel Walton from the Australian Workers’ Union and Craig Memery from the Public Interest Advocacy Centre and brings together 12 representatives from across the sector including manufacturers and clean energy groups.
Walton said the RESB will focus on creating new jobs and maximising the use of locally produced and supplied goods.
“These new policies should drive genuine accountability and replace the ‘tick and flick’ culture of procurement which has favoured overseas suppliers in recent decades,” he said.
Memery said the RESB will play a key role in making sure the energy sector is competitive to deliver choice for consumers and drive down electricity prices.
“We want to make sure our local workers and industries reap the economic benefits of the transition to cheap, reliable and renewable electricity, and we’ll be looking at ways to do this in the best interests of NSW electricity customers,” he said.
The RESB, a key component of the NSW Government’s energy legislation that passed through the NSW Parliament in November 2020, will provide its first report to the minister by the end of March.
The NSW announcement came on the same day the Queensland Government revealed  would establish a Ministerial Energy Council to work with government on delivering the state’s future energy needs, including the role of renewables and hydrogen.
“This decade will herald a significant adjustment in the way energy is produced, distributed and stored,” Energy Renewables and Hydrogen Minister Mick de Brenni said.
“Investors are lining up to capitalise on our world-class wind resources and highest solar intensity.”
A range of industry groups will have a seat at the table as well as the Electrical Trades Union and the Australian Energy Council.
De Brenni said a discussion about establishing a hydrogen supply chain in the state would top the agenda, adding Queensland’s publicly owned generation and supply chain assets provide a strong foundation to move forward.
“Renewable energy and transmission, manufacturing, resources and electrifying transport have the capacity to create 570,000 Australian jobs in the next five years,” he said.
“By establishing a Ministerial Energy Council, our government can leverage our foundational assets as a basis from which to harness the additional capacity of renewables to deliver real outcomes for Queenslanders.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/26/new-energy-solar-sells-up-assets-ahead-of-aussie-exit/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 26, 2021",New Energy Solar sells up assets ahead of Aussie exit,"ASX-listed New Energy Solar confirmed on Thursday it will offload its two Australian solar farms by the middle of the year after reporting a $74.3 million loss in 2020 and a strategic review recommended its exit from the Australian renewable energy market.
In announcing the company’s financial results for the year ending December 2020, New Energy Solar (NEW) CEO John Martin said the company would sell the 87 MW Beryl and 47 MW Manildra solar farms in New South Wales and exit the Australian market, opting to focus on the United States where it has a portfolio of 14 solar farms totalling 606 MW.
The move comes after the Australian-originated business appointed RBC Capital Markets last year to conduct a strategic review, triggered by the company trading at a deep discount to its net assets.
“Their initial recommendations were adopted and we … commenced the sale of the Australian assets and the exit from Australia,” Martin said.
“The US has a market that offers favourable regulatory and market settings for renewable energy.
“We had hoped to build NEW’s Australian portfolio but acquiring quality assets with long-term PPAs is more difficult in Australia. We concluded that we would not be able to achieve a business of scale here.”
NEW’s planned exit from the Australian market comes after a tough year for the investment entity which this week reported a net loss after tax of $79.1 million.
The company’s underlying earnings grew 36% in the year as new solar farms in the United States came online, but this was wiped out by the impact of reduced valuations of its solar portfolio with NEW forced to write down the value by $98.3 million on the back of falling expectations of future energy prices.
“A significant part of this reduction in value was recorded at the half year and resulted from the adoption of lower, long-term electricity price forecasts for the period 2025 to 2050,” NEW chair Jeffrey Whalan wrote in the annual financial report.
“Since the June half-year results, there has been a slight improvement in market forecasts of long-term US electricity prices but a further decline in forecasts of long-term Australian electricity prices”.
The devaluation of the US dollar against the Australian dollar also had a marked impact on valuations. During the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 the US dollar was 8.7% lower against the Australian dollar resulting in lower Australian dollar values for NEW’s US solar power plants and accounting for almost half of the decline in net asset value for FY 2020.
NEW said the sale of the Australian assets “is in hand” with the process expected to conclude in the first half of 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/26/relectrifys-revolve-rollout-gives-new-life-to-ev-batteries/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 26, 2021",Relectrify’s ReVolve rollout gives new life to EV batteries,"Melbourne-based Relectrify has announced it will target utility, commercial and industrial customer applications with the initial release of its ReVolve battery energy storage product, a modular 120 kWh BESS which uses second-life Nissan Leaf EV battery packs.
Fully integrated with the company’s cell-level battery management system (BMS), inbuilt inverter and control system, the ReVolve BESS is designed for installations in the 120 kWh to 2 MWh range.
Relectrify’s CEO and co-founder Valentin Muenzel said each 3-phase unit provides grid-compliant 400-480 Vac output, with 120 kWh capacity and 36 kVA continuous power. The units are suitable for both grid-connected and off-grid applications.
A $1.49 million grant announced this week by the Federal Government-owned Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) will help finance the initial roll-out of the ReVolve battery units.
ARENA said Relectrify, which has been working with American Electric Power Co (AEP) and Nissan North America on a pilot project, will now finalise development and undertake certifications ahead of the deployment of 20 ReVolve battery units across C&I applications throughout Australia.
“In some ways, we didn’t want to develop this product, but the market really pulled it out of us,” Muenzel said.
“Our pre-sales interest in the product has been very wide, from community battery storage applications, utilities looking for back-up and outage support for weak rural networks, and peak shaving for EV charge installs, to construction and mining services firms interested in stand-alone power supply and genset diesel fuel reduction.
“Given our uniquely competitive price-point, some customers are running the numbers and seeing absolutely phenomenal payback periods with our product.”
Muenzel said Relectrify’s BMS+Inverter technology – which avoids the need for standalone inverters – means the ReVolve is truly competitive pricewise, coming in 30% to 50% lower than comparable products on the market, while offering an expected lifetime of 3000 cycles. And at a roundtrip AC-to-AC efficiency of close to 90%, he said the second-life BESS compares strongly against new industrial storage systems.
“The storage market needs affordable battery storage, and we are thrilled to achieve this market-leading competitiveness with this product from the get-go,” Muenzel said.
“With Relectrify’s cell-level technology seeing increasingly widespread use, we look forward to working with industry leaders to co-develop future products using second-life or new batteries, including for residential, commercial, industrial and grid applications.”

Muenzel acknowledged the launch is an important milestone for the fledgling company but said the validation of a high-performing second-life system at a strongly competitive price-point is the much larger milestone.
EV batteries are often considered to have reached end-of-life when they have degraded to 80% of their initial capacity.
Relectrify is however determined to demonstrate the second-life battery remains a valuable and useful asset in stationary storage applications.
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said the project will help to reduce costs and improve pathways for battery storage to be installed at commercial scale, particularly in industrial settings.
“Battery storage is already playing a crucial role in supporting the transition to renewable energy within industry, however, we need to do more to make it commercially viable,” he said.
“Second-life batteries have significant potential to drive down costs, and Relectrify’s battery management and inverter technology can provide what is needed to transform them into valuable assets for businesses looking to make the switch.
“This new commercial-scale battery – roughly 10 times the size of a Tesla Powerwall 2 – will provide a cost-effective form of battery storage for use in commercial and industrial settings.
“Relecrify’s battery technology could be rolled out in a range of applications such as solar integration, providing back-up power on farms and to microgrids, deferring the need for network upgrade and replacing diesel generators.”
In one recent project example in New Zealand, Relectrify deployed its BMS+Inverter technology combining batteries from nine Nissan Leaf EVs, amounting to a 120 kWh battery system for electricity distributor Counties Power.
Relectrify is now listed on the pv magazine 2021 large-scale storage systems market overview.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/26/one-in-a-million-solar-drives-smart-meters-past-the-million-milestone/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,NEW ZEALAND",BLAKE MATICH,"FEBRUARY 26, 2021","One in a million, solar drives smart meters past the million milestone","Surging solar installations have pushed Australia’s and New Zealand’s smart meter market past the million-meter milestone, according to smart metering services provider Intellihub. 
The millionth smart meter was installed as part of the connection requirements for a new rooftop PV system at a suburban home in Sydney, one of the many thousands of Antipodean homes continuing the region’s strong uptake of residential solar. 
Smart meters, which eliminate dodgey readings, allow monthly billing, provide the solar owner with dynamic load control to save money and even provide for the installation of larger solar systems, is good for the consumer and good for the grid at large. 
Moreover, as Aussies and Kiwis begin to take up electric vehicles (EVs), smart meters better allow for smooth energy orchestration throughout the home and across devices including EVs. 
“One million meters under management is a special milestone to crack,” Intellihub Group CEO Adrian Clarke said, “The smart meters we are installing now are a lot different to what was on the market a few years ago. There has been a big focus on the meter offering more to consumers participating in the two-side energy market.” 
Like in Rugby, and indeed politics, New Zealand is more advanced in the meter market than Australia. According to Clarke the Land of the Long White Cloud is close to full penetration (90%) of smart meters, “but the Australian market has been slower to adopt modern metering technology. But that is now starting to change, as we’re seeing more Australian homes adopt solar and other behind the meter solutions.” 
The milestone was reached only a week after Intellihub called for changes to the Australian Energy Market Commission’s (AEMC) metering services framework. In a submission to the AEMC, Intellihub said that competition was delivering a better and more efficient service but that Australia still lagged behind in other aspects. 
According to Intellihub, Australia only became a viable market in late 2017 when reforms from state and federal governments (except Victoria), helped to unlock scale. Intellihub says that almost two million of the active meters in Australia, excepting Victoria, are over 30 years old, and 365,000 are more than 50 years old. 
Of course, there is nothing much wrong with durability and longevity as such, but the transformation of the grid necessarily means a transformation of metering technology. 
Intellihub says that 65% of its new meter installs in 2020 were a direct result of solar installations.
