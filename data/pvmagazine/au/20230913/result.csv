The company has become the latest in a spate of foreign players announcing multi-billion dollar investments into Australia’s renewable market. In the last weeks alone, Philippines company ACEN announced it would invest $6 billion (USD 3.86 billion) in Australian projects over the next three years; with French-giant Neoen saying it plans to get its Australian portfolio to 10 GW by 2030, enacting a “multi-billion dollar forward investment plan.”
Meanwhile, Canada’s Brookfield is planning “at least” a $20 billion investment into Australian renewables, largely via its takeover bid for Origin Energy which is currently before regulators.
Gentari’s Australian expansion comes off the back of its acquisition of Wirsol Energy and Australian assets from German-based group Wircon. That deal was finalised in February and saw Gentari inherit a portfolio including 422 MW of operational solar and storage projects and nearly double that in development.
The company is looking to boost its Australian renewable portfolio 12-fold before 2030, with CEO Sushil Purohit telling the Australian Financial Review it will do so via a mixture of acquisitions, joint ventures and organic growth.
Gentari executives say they expect Australia to be one of the company’s biggest international markets, behind only India. Overall, Gentari is targeting a global portfolio of wind and solar assets between 30 GW and 40 GW by 2030.
Gentari said on Tuesday that Wirsol Energy will now be renamed Gentari Solar Australia.

For renewable industries, the Roadmap became something of a lighthouse – a beacon of strong energy transition policy in sprawling darkness.
Now, three years later, the nation is looking more like a dog that caught the mail truck – so much energy has been drawn into advocating for policy that figuring out how to actually execute it has taken a backseat.
“Really the only strategy that was put forward is building Renewable Energy Zones and then building large transmission projects to connect them,” Jack Curtis, cofounder of technology startup Neara, tells pv magazine Australia. “We’ve started to see really the first challenges of executing that ambition.”
Those challenges were laid out earlier this month with the publication of the NSW Electricity Checkup, undertaken by the state’s new Labor government to assess the progress of the state’s original Roadmap. “It’s become very clear that the five Renewable Energy Zones that NSW thought would get us there, will not get us there on time, definitely not on budget, and definitely not in a way that navigates the whole social license thing particularly cleanly.”
This issue is not contained to NSW either, since virtually all Australian governments have similarly designed policies. “Everybody realises that no energy transition policy in this country, whether state or federal, is going to be realised with the current strategies,” Curtis says, adding that these strategies are not totally impotent, but rather inadequate to reach our decarbonisation commitments.

“At the time the new [NSW] government came into power, that was starting to really reach a crescendo where all throughout the industry there was pretty much a view that there was no way it was going to get there.”
While headlines on the NSW Checkup report focussed on the possible extension of Eraring, Australia’s biggest coal plant, the report also advised the government to better leverage the state’s existing electricity transmission networks, alongside distributed energy resources like household solar and battery systems.

For Curtis, this marks a crucial shift in thinking away from the traditional ‘big projects, big transmission, big numbers,’ into a more nuanced approach that includes working better with the infrastructure we already have. 
Neara recently worked with NSW network Essential Energy to digitally model and analyse its network at a granular level to uncover how much more capacity it could carry. This ‘digital twin’ system is able to run millions of simulations on things like individual power line heat ratings, which dictates how much electricity power lines can carry, and ultimately identified the network could carry far more electricity without having to change any physical infrastructure. 
Looking beyond Essential Energy’s network, Curtis says Australia’s existing grid has 10 GW of untapped network capacity available right now.
“That 10 GW number is probably achievable without any meaningful incremental cost investment,” he adds.

That number, Curtis says, has the potential to double again with strategic investment in network augmentation on the existing grid. That 20 GW figure, he adds, is still to be validated but Curtis doesn’t think it’s hyperbolic goal. Moreover, he says the cost of efficient augmentation would be “far, far, far lower than building new transmission or keeping coal plants online.”
“What you end up with is a bit of a sliding scale,” he adds, noting the more you spend, the more you unlock. “But I think there’s a long way to go before you match up the existing network at a cost profile that is greater than the cost of building new infrastructure and transmission lines.”
It is only this year, 2023, that the existing grid’s potential has been made visible. This is because technologies capable of digitally modelling electrical infrastructure have now become commercially available and, more importantly, networks have actually begun leveraging and drawing insights from those tools and data.
As Curtis outlines, digital modelling isn’t about making a visual model, but one that can simulate everything in the existing network behaviourally, mechanically, and physically. With this, networks are able to run complex simulations to figure out what the fully-utilised version of their networks looks like for the first time.
For such new technology, Curtis says it has already seen enormous uptake. “In NSW, now 99% of distribution network is digitally modelled,” he says.
This modelling is happening in all states “to one degree or another,” he adds. Victorian networks Citipower and Powercor are “very engaged,” as is SA Power Networks in South Australia and Western Power in Western Australia.
“I think at this point I would say like 60% to 70% of market is very proactive,” the other 20% is “committed” and only a small minority is hesitant, Curtis says.
It is this reportedly significant uptake from networks themselves that Curtis believes has enabled governments like NSW Labor to feel solid about shifting its strategy focus.
According to Curtis, it’s only a matter of time until leveraging existing networks becomes understood as an important climate strategy Australia-wide. “It’s only in the last couple of months that the NSW state government [has begun discussing this] and that’s only because they had a very specific initiative focussed on consulting with industry.”
“I don’t think it’s going to take much time for this to roll up to a federal level.”

In April, Dr Gabrielle Kuiper, a director of the Superpower Institute, wrote a piece entitled ‘Dead duck curve: Rooftop solar saturation can be big win for consumers and grid.’ In it, she drew on modelling from ITP Renewables and essentially found that rooftop solar coupled with local battery storage massively decreases peak demand on the grid, undercutting the case for big transmission investments.
Like many industry players and analysts pv magazine Australia speaks to, Curtis believes there should be much more focus on deploying distributed energy resources (DER) rather than continuing to be informed by the centralised power systems of old (that is, big generation, big transmission).
“It’s almost like a weird kind of inverse correlation where the cheapest, most cost effective way of doing it is behind-the-meter but its the hardest for people to compute; its the hardest for people to aggregate to real large numbers. So they default to ‘ok, build big transmission, big centralised projects, that can get us the big numbers,’” Curtis says. Big projects are more complex to rollout than small-scale from both a time and cost perspective, but this approach continues to dominate because it’s much easier to conceptualise how it can be executed, he adds.
On the other hand, there is a lot of complexity in aggregating and optimising DER it at a high level because it is an amalgamation of hundreds of thousands of generating assets. “But the potential of it is greater than anything else and should replace the need for large centralised projects and large transmission to connect those projects.”

Residential solar panels are often sold with long-term loans or leases, with homeowners entering contracts of 20 years or more. But how long do panels last, and how resilient are they?
Panel life depends on several factors, including climate, module type, and the racking system used, among others. While there isn’t a specific “end date” for a panel per se, loss of production over time often forces equipment retirements.
When deciding whether to keep your panel running 20-30 years in the future, or to look for an upgrade at that time, monitoring output levels is the best way to make an informed decision.
The loss of output over time, called degradation, typically lands at about 0.5% each year, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
Manufacturers typically consider 25 to 30 years a point at which enough degradation has occurred where it may be time to consider replacing a panel. The industry standard for manufacturing warranties is 25 years on a solar module, said NREL.
Given the 0.5% benchmark annual degradation rate, a 20-year-old panel is capable of producing about 90% of its original capability.
Panel quality can make some impact on degradation rates. NREL reports premium manufacturers like Panasonic and LG have rates of about 0.3% per year, while some brands degrade at rates as high as 0.80%. After 25 years, these premium panels could still produce 93% of their original output, and the higher-degradation example could produce 82.5%.

Some manufacturers build their panels with PID-resistant materials in their glass, encapsulation, and diffusion barriers.
All panels also suffer something called light induced degradation (LID), in which panels lose efficiency within the first hours of being exposed to the sun. LID varies from panel to panel based on the quality of the crystalline silicon wafers, but usually results in a one-time, 1-3% loss in efficiency, said testing laboratory PVEL, PV Evolution Labs.
The exposure to weather conditions is the main driver in panel degradation. Heat is a key factor in both real-time panel performance and degradation over time. Ambient heat negatively affects the performance and efficiency of electrical components, according to NREL.
By checking the manufacturer’s data sheet, a panel’s temperature coefficient can be found, which will demonstrate the panel’s ability to perform in higher temperatures.
The coefficient explains how much real-time efficiency is lost by each degree of Celsius increased above the standard temperature of 25 degrees Celsius. For example, a temperature coefficient of -0.353% means that for every degree Celsius above 25, 0.353% of total production capability is lost.
Heat exchange drives panel degradation through a process called thermal cycling. When it is warm, materials expand, and when the temperature lowers, they contract. This movement slowly causes microcracks to form in the panel over time, lowering output.
In its annual Module Score Card study, PVEL analysed 36 operational solar projects in India, and found significant impacts from heat degradation. The average annual degradation of the projects landed at 1.47%, but arrays located in colder, mountainous regions degraded at nearly half that rate, at 0.7%.
Proper installation can help deal with heat related issues. Panels should be installed a few inches above the roof, so that convective air can flow beneath and cool the equipment. Light-coloured materials can be used in panel construction to limit heat absorption. And components like inverters and combiners, whose performance is particularly sensitive to heat, should be located in shaded areas, suggested CED Greentech.
Wind is another weather condition that can cause some harm to solar panels. Strong wind can cause flexing of the panels, called dynamic mechanical load. This also causes microcracks in the panels, lowering output. Some racking solutions are optimised for high-wind areas, protecting the panels from strong uplift forces and limiting microcracking. Typically, the manufacturer’s datasheet will provide information on the max winds the panel is able to withstand.
The same goes for snow, which can cover panels during heavier storms, limiting output. Snow can also cause a dynamic mechanical load, degrading the panels. Typically, snow will slide off of panels, as they are slick and run warm, but in some cases a homeowner may decide to clear the snow off the panels. This must be done carefully, as scratching the glass surface of the panel would make a negative impact on output.

Degradation is a normal, unavoidable part of a panel’s life. Proper installation, careful snow clearing, and careful panel cleaning can help with output, but ultimately, a solar panel is a technology with no moving parts, requiring very little maintenance.
To ensure a given panel is likely to live a long life and operate as planned, it must undergo standards testing for certification. Panels are subject to the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) testing, which apply to both mono- and polycrystalline panels.
EnergySage said panels that achieve IEC 61215 standard are tested for electrical characteristics like wet leakage currents, and insulation resistance. They under go a mechanical load test for both wind and snow, and climate tests that check for weaknesses to hot spots, UV exposure, humidity-freeze, damp heat, hail impact, and other outdoor exposure.
IEC 61215 also determines a panel’s performance metrics at standard test conditions, including temperature coefficient, open-circuit voltage, and maximum power output.
Also commonly seen on a panel spec sheet is the seal of Underwriters Laboratories (UL), which also provides standards and testing. UL runs climactic and ageing tests, as well as the full gamut of safety tests.
Failures
Solar panel failure happens at a low rate. NREL conducted a study of over 50,000 systems installed in the United States and 4,500 globally between the years of 2000 and 2015. The study found a median failure rate of 5 panels out of 10,000 annually.

Panel failure has improved markedly over time, as it was found that system installed between 1980 and 2000 demonstrated a failure rate double the post-2000 group.

System downtime is rarely attributed to panel failure. In fact, a study by kWh Analytics found that 80% of all solar plant downtime is a result of failing inverters, the device that converts the panel’s DC current to usable AC. pv magazine will analyse inverter performance in the next installment of this series.

A research group in Australia has defined a series of recommendations for the design of a product stewardship scheme for solar photovoltaic panels and its financial support. Product stewardship consists of a series of actions aimed at preventing waste during the design and manufacturing of a process in an effort to minimise the health, environmental, and social impacts of a product.
“Our work presents a comprehensive product stewardship scheme for solar PV panels, which is, as far as I know, the first one published,” the research’s lead author, Peter Majewski, told pv magazine. “It covers new and legacy panels and provides a solution for covering costs.”
In the study “Product stewardship scheme for solar photovoltaic panels,” published in Current Opinion in Green and Sustainable Chemistry, Majewski and his colleagues explained that a well-designed stewardship scheme should define unequivocally which are the responsibilities of the industry and which are those of consumers in regard to the end-of-life management of a given product.
They also said that, as a rule of thumb, landfill bans, tracking of the panels’ serial numbers, and a clear definition of ownership should always be included in the legislation for end-of-life solar products. Furthermore, they said that a Product Stewardship Organisation (PSO) should report to the government on the results and effectiveness of the scheme.
“Once the panels are installed on a rooftop of private dwellings, their operator is obviously the owner of the dwelling,” they explained. “However, once the panels are dismantled and on their way to a recycler, ownership and responsibilities for the proper handling of the panels needs to be clarified. In case of commercially used solar PV panels of solar farms, it can be expected that business agreements between panel manufacturers and solar farm operators clarify the ownership and end-of-life arrangement for the panels before solar farm gets planning approval.”
The scientists created a workflow diagram showing the flow of panels from retail to the customer and to the recycler. The upper part shows how panels may be recycled or re-used as second-hand products, while the lower part shows the B2B arrangement between manufacturers and PV system owners.
The Australian group also explained that all new legislation for end-of-life panels should also apply to modules that are already in operation, considering both their recycling and re-use, and should also avoid calculating recovery rates in terms of weight, as this system may encourage the recycling of “heavy” components only.
As for the re-use of the panels, the academics warned that these should be linked to an electric compliance certificate provided by a certified electrician, which would ensure their safe operation. “Consumers of second-hand solar PV panels need to be certain that the second-hand panels are still working at a defined capacity,” they stated. “Therefore, a certificate would be necessary that provides information about the capacity and age of the second-hand panel.”
The Australian team also sought to define the level of the levy needed to put the scheme in place and said it should be continuously adjustable to ensure high collection and recycling rates. “A fully funded not for profit PSO, which is overseeing and managing the product stewardship scheme, usually achieves high collection rates,” they emphasised. “It can, therefore, be recommended, that the levy is set at a level which not only allows to support collection and recycling of the panels, but also provides funds to support the operations of an effective PSO.”
As a final warning, the researchers said that any legislation for PV module recycling and re-use should be in place before significant amounts of solar waste are generated.
The research group comprises scientists from the University of South Australia, the University of New South Wales (UNSW), US-based PV module recycling company Solarcycle Inc., USA, and Australian association Circular PV Alliance (CPVA).
