Belinda Fan, X-Elio’s country manager in Australia said the 300MW Maxwell Solar Farm is being developed on a 1013-hectare site about 23 kilometres south of Wagga Wagga. The company also plans to include a storage component to the project but is yet to reveal sizing details.
“We will develop the design of both the solar farm and storage over the next phase of development in conjunction with the utility as well as other project stakeholders,” Fan said in an emailed statement, adding X-Elio has “significant ambition to grow our investments in Australia”.
The Maxwell Solar Farm, which will dwarf the 200MW Blue Grass Solar Farm being developed by X-Elio near Chinchilla in Queensland’s Western Downs region, will connect to the national grid via Transgrid’s existing 330kV transmission lines.
X-Elio said in the first year of operation the solar farm would produce about 610GWh of renewable energy, enough to power more than 115,000 Australian homes and offset approximately 400,000 tonnes of carbon emissions per annum.
The company said the project site has been secured and the grid connection feasibility study is underway. X-Elio has also initiated the development approval process with the NSW Department of Planning, Industry & Environment but Fan stressed the project is only in its early stages.
“The project is currently at an early assessment stage,” she said. “We are commencing grid studies and initiating planning processes, including hosting community consultations, all of which will inform the project’s design.
“We are working towards securing required permits within the next 12-18 months and commencing construction towards late 2023.”

Fan said the project site is ideally located in an area of “abundant solar resource with convenient and prime access to the transmission network”.
“Additionally, the Maxwell Solar Farm project is located within the proposed Wagga Renewable Energy Zone (REZ),” she said.
The project site is located about 150 kilometres to the east of the proposed South-West REZ, one of five designated clean energy areas detailed in the NSW government’s electricity roadmap.
A recent registration of interest (ROI) process for the South-West REZ in the western Riverina attracted more than 34GW of large-scale wind, solar PV and energy storage proposals, more than 10 times the likely capacity of the zone.
The project site is also within close proximity to Project EnergyConnect, a new $2.3 billion electricity interconnector being built by Transgrid and ElectraNet between Wagga Wagga and Robertstown in South Australia.
Project EnergyConnect will also deliver an upgrade for the transmission line between Wagga Wagga and Dinawan, which links to the eastern edge of the REZ, and is expected to unlock up to 1.2 GW of additional transmission capacity.
The Maxwell Solar Farm is the latest project in Australia for X-Elio which entered the market in 2017.

The company, co-owned by US investment firms Brookfield and KKR, expected to achieve full commercial operations of the Blue Grass Solar Farm early this year after reaching financial close for the $215 million project.
The 120MW Forest Glen and 80MW Wunghnu solar farms in NSW and Victoria respectively are also part of the more than 500MW of projects X-Elio has in development in Australia.
The Maxwell Solar Farm adds to a plethora of solar projects planned for the Wagga Wagga region.
Fellow Spanish renewables developer Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV) has secured financing for its 90MW Sebastopol Solar Farm being developed near Temora to the north of Wagga Wagga while the Australian arm of German-headquartered renewable energy developer BayWa r.e is developing the 12MW Sandy Creek Solar Farm to the south of the town.
Origin Energy has plans to build a 200MW solar farm and associated battery storage at nearby Uranquinty while Greek energy company Mytilineos and its subsidiary Metka EGN has commenced construction on a 23MW extension to the 40MW Wagga Solar Farm.
Fan said the proposed solar farm at Maxwell would “deliver huge economic and social benefits to the local community”, including approximately 300-350 full time construction jobs and 8-12 full time operational roles.
Fan said X-Elio will now commence a year-long program of consultation with the local community so their concerns and feedback can be considered and factored into planning and assessments.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/11/rooftop-solar-shines-as-renewable-energy-share-jumps-to-35/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 11, 2022",Rooftop solar shines as renewable energy share jumps to 35%,"The transition of Australia’s energy sector continues to accelerate with new data released by the Federal Government on Friday revealing renewable energy accounted for nearly one-third of the electricity produced in the National Electricity Market (NEM) in 2021.
Energy Minister Angus Taylor said in a statement that renewable energy, including rooftop and utility-scale solar PV had delivered a record 32.2% of the electricity in the NEM in 2021, a figure that climbed to 35.8% in the final quarter.
Total generation from all renewable energy sources across Australia in 2021 rose 23% compared to the previous year, delivering 72.5TWh.
A record number of rooftop solar installations was key to the renewable energy generation, with approximately 380,000 systems, a massive 40% increase on 2020, installed across Australia last year with a combined capacity of 3.2GW.
Australia has one of the highest per-capita rooftop solar installation rates in the world with a combined 17GW now installed across more than 3 million rooftops. More than 25% of Australian households are now generating power on their roofs.
While rooftop solar continued to set new records, 2.9GW of new large-scale wind and solar power stations were also committed in 2021, continuing an upward trend in renewable energy investment over the past two years.
The Clean Energy Regulator (CER) expects the first half of this year will also be very strong for new renewable energy project announcements and construction beginning on major developments.

Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the continuing investment in renewable energy has cemented Australia’s place as world leaders in bringing down emissions.
“Last year $7.4 billion or $284 per person was invested in renewable energy in Australia. This puts us ahead of countries including Canada, Germany, Japan, France, China and the United States on a per-person basis,” he said.
The influx of renewable energy generation has caused a major shake-up in Australia’s energy market with the owners of several of the nation’s ageing coal-fired generators declaring the ongoing transition has made the fossil-fuel plants uneconomic.
Origin Energy last month announced the 2.88GW Eraring power station in the New South Wales (NSW) Hunter region will be closed in August 2025, seven years earlier than previously scheduled.
AGL has also confirmed it will bring forward the planned closure of its two biggest coal-fired power plants – including the 2.64GWW Bayswater coal-fired power plant in the Hunter to “no later than” 2033 and for its 2.21GW Loy Yang A power station in Victoria to 2045. AGL’s coal-fired Liddell power plant, also in the Hunter, is scheduled to close in April 2023.
Environmental advocates have applauded the planned closure of the coal-fired plants but Taylor warned a balance between renewables and on-demand reliable power is required to ensure the grid is stable.
“That’s why the government has taken decisive action to support the Tallawarra B gas generator and Port Kembla gas project, and we are stepping up to deliver Snowy Hydro’s Hunter power project at Kurri Kurri in the Hunter Valley,” he said.
“We are also prioritising work on a new fit-for-purpose market design, including a capacity mechanism and delivering flexible backup generation and storage such as the 2000MW pumped hydro expansion of the Snowy Hydro scheme which is needed to balance and complement very high levels of intermittent renewables.”
Taylor said the government has also committed more than $500,000 to support major transmission projects that will enable new renewable generation.
“These include the Marinus Link needed to turn Tasmania’s Battery of the Nation vision into reality and Project EnergyConnect and VNI West that will build new interconnectors between South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/11/trina-solar-launches-new-rooftop-module-in-australian-market/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 11, 2022",Trina Solar launches new rooftop module in Australian market,"Chinese PV heavyweight Trina Solar has unveiled a new addition to its Vertex solar module range, launching the Vertex S+ which has a power output of up to 425W with maximum efficiency of 21.9%.
The new product, which uses 210mm diameter wafers and features double-glass design in place of the conventional glass-and-backsheet structure, has been specifically designed for residential installations as well as for commercial and industrial (C&I) rooftops.
Trina Solar Asia Pacific president Todd Li said on Thursday the double-glass panel has been designed to resist performance degradation and delivered greater efficiency and durability, particularly in hot and humid environments.
“The Vertex S+ module we are launching today is ideally suited to Australia,” he said. “It is the very first 425W module in Australia that comes with double-glass, rather than backsheet.
“Double-glass is more durable, allowing the module to perform even in very hot or very hot and humid environments.”
Trina said the panel combines innovative technologies including the company’s N-type PACO Cell technology, 210mm diameter wafers, multi-busbar (MBB), non-destructive cutting and high-density packing.
Li said the installer-friendly Vertex S+ weighs in at 21.5kg, making it ideal for Australian rooftops.
“The module has been designed for easy-to-handle installation thanks in part to its light weight and the fact it is compatible with existing mainstream mounting systems, optimizers and inverters for residential and C&I applications,” he said.

“Vertex S+ excels in key areas such as: power, efficiency, size, weight, appearance, ease of installation, load, reliability and safety.”
The Vertex S+ module comes with a 25-year product warranty and a 30-year power warranty.
Trina said the new, more powerful Vertex module aligns with the trend in the Australia rooftop segment where consumers are opting for more powerful systems
Li said Australian households are turning to higher power, efficiency modules to meet their needs while C&I companies are turning to rooftop solar to offset rising electricity prices.
Trina expects it will begin shipping in April with the first of the modules likely to arrive in Australia later that month.
Li said the decision to launch the new module in Australia was a deliberate one as it looks to “reinforce our position as Australia’s number-one solar module brand and to capitalise on the tremendous growth in the commercial, industrial and residential solar market here”.
“We anticipate that following today’s launch, we will further increase our lead in Australia as the country’s number-one brand of solar module,” he said.
Data published last month by solar market research company Sunwiz shows Trina was Australia’s most popular brand of solar module in 2021.
In its 2021 Australian PV Panel MarketView report, Sunwiz said Trina had increased its market share to 14% as the nation rolled out a record 5.2GW of PV.
Trina enjoyed high market share across residential, C&I, and large-scale segments.
Trina launched its 670W Vertex panel in March last year. A month earlier it released the  390-405W Vertex S panel in Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/11/origin-accelerates-delivery-of-large-scale-renewable-energy-strategy/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 11, 2022",Origin accelerates delivery of large-scale renewable energy strategy,"Power provider Origin has outlined plans for “multi-gigawatt” growth in renewable energy this decade after last month announcing it would shutter the 2.88GW Eraring power plant in New South Wales (NSW) in 2025, seven years earlier than originally scheduled.
Origin Energy chief executive Frank Calabria this week said the rapid transition of Australia’s fossil fuel-dominated power grid towards renewable energy sources presented a “lot of growth opportunities for an organisation like Origin” which is seeking to become a net-zero business by 2050.
“We have a belief in decarbonisation that’s good for business and our shareholders, and good for the environment and customers,” he said. “We’ve made some meaningful decisions to move our portfolio in that direction.”
Calabria told investors on Wednesday the company is targeting a staged and disciplined investment as part of a strategy refresh in response to the continuing, rapid transition of the National Electricity Market (NEM).
Origin said during the investor briefing it is “strategically positioned to benefit from the energy transition through growth opportunities such as energy retailing, providing a diverse portfolio of energy supply in a low-carbon post-Eraring world, gas production and wholesaling, and its investment in British renewable energy group, Octopus Energy”.
The company said it is preparing to give financial approval for the first 460MW stage of a 700MW big battery to be built at the site of Eraring near Newcastle by the end of this year. That will be followed by the construction of the proposed 240MW second stage of the battery.
Origin also plans to grow its in-house virtual power plant (VPP) – comprising rooftop solar installs, electric vehicles and batteries linked to demand-management technology to control electricity flows – from about 200MW to 2GW.

Calabria said the growth could be achieved over the next four years with the VPP to deliver “very low cost” replacement capacity for the coal-fired Eraring plant near Newcastle.
Alongside the expansion of the VPP and an increase in battery storage, Origin also plans to target domestic green hydrogen supply from the mid-2020s and export supply from late 2020s. Origin predicts the hydrogen market to grow by 500% by 2050.
Origin said it will also partner with others and use third party capital to grow its renewables energy supply, including growing its solar business.
Origin is already one of Australia’s largest buyers of utility scale solar, with agreements to buy more than 680MW of solar energy signed since 2016. These include power purchase agreements with the 56MW Moree Solar Farm in northern NSW and the 100MW Clare Solar Farm in northern Queensland.
“The customer experience will change, our capabilities, the use of technology, the scale of our customer base, the products we offer,” Calabria said. “As Eraring comes out, we have a great opportunity to grow both renewable storage and other ability to manage energy supply.”
The announcement from Origin comes just weeks after it brought forward the closure of the largest single power station in Australia from 2032 to August 2025, declaring there is no longer business case for “baseload” fossil fuels.
Origin’s proposed exit from coal-fired generation reflects the continuing, rapid transition of the NEM as we move to cleaner sources of energy,” Calabria said at the time.
“The reality is the economics of coal-fired power stations are being put under increasing, unsustainable pressure by cleaner and lower-cost generation, including solar, wind and batteries.”

Origin said it is confident that building more on-demand energy assets like big batteries as well as new transmission lines to improve the flow of power would “more than compensate” for Eraring’s exit.
“The transition is already changing our customers’ energy needs,” the company said. “Customers are increasingly installing rooftop solar and purchasing less grid energy in the middle of the day.
“Grid-scale renewable energy is also increasing, further reducing the need for baseload power.”
Also this week, Origin said it would undertake an on-market share buy-back of $250 million, saying it was in a “strong financial position” with a robust outlook for the business and capital structure “comfortably” within its target range.
“This means we are now in a position to increase shareholder distributions with a share buyback of $250 million,” Calabria said.
“Going forward, we will continue to balance expected increased cash flow available for shareholder distributions with growth investments.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/11/5b-and-zenith-energy-partner-up-for-mining-industry-solar-deployment/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"MARCH 11, 2022",5B and Zenith Energy partner up for mining industry solar deployment,"Sydney-based solar innovator 5B has signed an Ecosystem Framework Agreement-Deployment (ESAD) with independent power producer Zenith Energy which will see the duo combine to deploy 5B’s prefabricated and rapidly deployable Maverick solar systems on mine sites. 
5B has been busy in recent months. In January the modular pioneer announced a $33.4 million tech innovation program to accelerate the delivery of what the Federal government as called “ultra low cost solar”. The program is supported by a whopping $14 million grant from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA). 
The funding, which comes less than a year after 5B closed a $12 million funding round, including investment support from former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Smart Energy Council director Simon Holmes à Court, includes a heavy portion devoted to the realisation of solar installation robots. 
And in December 2021, 5B acquired an Adelaide manufacturing plant ahead of the global gigawatt-scale push of its rapidly deployable, modular, prefabricated Maverick solar arrays.
So it should come as no surprise that Zenith managing director Hamish Moffat described the partnership as the next step in reducing emissions across Zenith’s legacy portfolio. 
“We’ve been looking to increase renewable assets across multiple sites for some time,” said Moffat, “the question has always been around how we can achieve that in such a way that is economically viable. The 5B Maverick system is re-deployable, meaning it can be integrated on mines with shorter tenure, and moved at the end of operations at those sites.”

It is therefore the Maverick system’s re-deployability that made the business case viable. “It offers Zenith greater ability to leverage value from our initial capital expenditure, making it more cost effective to offer expanded renewable energy solutions for our clients.” 
5B co-founder and CEO Chris McGrath seconded the importance of the strategic partnership, calling it a validation of 5B MAverick’s ability to reduce deployment complexity. 
“This has been a major barrier for solar installations on mine sites worldwide,” said McGrath. “The agreement also shows that our cost reduction efforts over the past two years have worked – we’ve hit the price point where 5B Mavericks can be viably packed up, and redeployed elsewhere, substantially reducing the risk of stranded assets in minding, agricultural and industrial operations.” 
According to the companies the 5B Maverick system will be installed at three sites off the bat, with more likely to come in the future. 
Nova, WA
The first of these is IGO’s Nova nickel mine in the Fraser Range of Western Australia, approximately 360km southeast of Kalgoorlie, the country of the Ngadju People, Traditional Owners of the land. The mine produces nickel, copper and cobalt. With the aid of a 10MW 5B Maverick system and a 10MW battery energy storage system (BESS), Zenith is aiming for its first ‘engine-off’ project, whereby the mine site will be able to operate for up to nine consecutive hours on renewable energy. 
Warrawoona, WA
The second site is Calidus’s Warrawoona Gold Project in the Pilbara Goldfield of Western Australia, approximately 150km southeast of Port Hedland on Nyamal country. Zenith is set to install a 4MW DC solar farm at the site using 5B Maverick, along with a 3MW/3MWh AC BESS to further reduce gas consumption on the site. 
King of the Hills 
Thirdly, Red 5’s King of the Hills Gold Mine in the Eastern Goldfields region of Western Australia, 28km north of the town of Leonora, where 2MW of 5B Maverick is already being deployed and to be supported by a BESS. 
McGrath said 5B was keen to partner with Zenith, given the IPPs strong reputation and credibility in providing renewable energy solutions to the mining and resources industry. “It’s great to see Zenith leveraging the ability of the 5B Maverick solar arrays to deploy up to 10 times faster, more safety than single axis tracker and fixed tilt solar systems, to deliver a full solution for their customers.” 
Similarly, Moffat said the partnership was an opportunity for Zenith to lead the industry in demonstrating the ability and capacity to effectively integrate renewable energy solutions.
