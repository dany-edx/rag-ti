In fact, in AEMO’S 2022 Integrated System Plan (released 30 June 2022), EVs are expected to overtake internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles by 2038-39. This will be a significant factor in shaping Australia’s future energy systems and markets.
This article looks at the expected daily demand profile for EV charging across the NEM in 2040, based on projections for trends in EV usage and charging behaviours, in comparison to the daily NEM operational demand profile for June 2022 provided for context.
Particularly noteworthy from the above chart is the two roughly equally-sized peaks in EV demand – the first of which occurs in the middle of the day and coincides with the solar PV generation peak, where EVs can make use of abundant renewable energy supply (and likely low wholesale energy pricing).
The second peak between 7pm-10pm is likely to be more consequential in terms of impacts to the operation of the grid, as it seeks to heighten the ‘head of the duck’ curve (the peak in the pink Operational Demand line).
The demand forecast is divided into several charging modes or profiles, which are each defined by considering an anticipated usage pattern of the EV and motivation for plugging it in:
While 2040 is a long time away, such an increase in evening peak demand may cause headaches for network operators and planners if this view of EV charging behaviour becomes a reality.
An alternate mitigation strategy could focus on avoiding the ‘convenience charging’ peak in the first place, with clever use of timers and smart chargers (both of which are already available on the market) to shift and spread the demand through the night, and to coordinate charging with renewable energy output.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/11/csiro-tips-global-influences-to-stall-cost-reductions-for-renewables/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 11, 2022",CSIRO tips global influences to stall cost reductions for renewables,"New analysis from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) shows that even when factoring in additional integration costs arising due to the variable output of renewables, solar PV and wind remain the cheapest sources of new electricity generation in Australia.
The results are included in the latest edition of the GenCost report, developed by the CSIRO in collaboration with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and industry members to deliver an annual update of electricity generation and storage costs.
CSIRO chief energy economist Paul Graham said the 2021-22 report confirms past years’ findings that wind and solar remain the cheapest source of electricity generation in Australia but suggested the influence of global events on the domestic market will likely put further cost reductions on hold for the next year.
“What will be different in the next year is that we will have a confluence of factors impacting project costs,” he said.
“The war in Ukraine has resulted in fossil energy price inflation which flows through to all parts of the economy through transport and energy costs. We also have tight supply chains that are still recovering.”
Graham said projections in the report assume that cost reductions for all technologies will stall for the next 12 months but after the current inflationary cycle ends, solar, wind, and batteries are all projected to keep getting cheaper.
The GenCost report compares and estimates the levelised cost of large-scale electricity generation and storage in Australia, encompassing current capital cost estimates commissioned by AEMO.

CSIRO chief executive officer Larry Marshall said the report considers a range of future scenarios to understand the mix of technologies that may be adopted and costs for each of these possible pathways and provides important insights into the electricity market, helping industry and government navigate Australia’s energy transition.
“Australia’s energy sector faces a number of unique challenges as we navigate the transition to net zero emissions,” he said. “GenCost is a rigorous analysis to help inform decision makers with detailed insights to support the decarbonisation of Australia’s energy system.
“The latest report shows renewables are holding steady as the lowest cost source of new-build electricity.”
The CSIRO said onshore wind and solar PV without transmission or storage costs are the lowest cost generation technology by “a significant margin”. The agency’s analysis also confirms that even when necessary integration costs are included, adding new variable renewable generation (to as high as a 90% share of the grid is still cheaper than non-renewable options.
It also shows that solar and wind only begin to require additional investments in storage and transmission when variable renewables reach about 50% share of generation. Even then they remain the cheapest sources of electricity up to a 90% share of generation. The analysis says from there, a mix of other renewables such as hydro power, biomass, and green hydrogen would be required to transition to a 100% renewables system.

While wind and solar PV remain the cheapest forms of generation, the report also indicates that battery costs, based on projects deployed, have experienced a modest 5% to 6% decline on previous years’ costs.
The 2022 report also includes an update on costs of hydrogen electrolysers, highlighting that they are experiencing “rapid cost reductions” and could support a faster transition to green hydrogen, particularly in the current context of high natural gas prices.
The updated analyses also found that cost reductions for technologies not currently being widely deployed such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), nuclear small modular reactors, solar thermal, and ocean energy are lagging and require increased investment to realise their full potential.
AEMO system design executive general manager Merryn York said analysis shows that timely investment in new, firmed renewables will provide the most economic form of electricity generation moving forward.
“With growing opportunity to decarbonise Australia’s economy, understanding the investments that can support a low emissions power system, provide resilience to international pressures, and reduce consumer costs is critically important to enabling the energy transition,” she said.

The Darlington Point battery is part of an energy storage system with a combined 150 MW/300 MWh of storage capacity spread over three individual but co-located assets. The project comprises the 60 MW/120 MWh Riverina Energy Storage System 1, the 65 MW/130 MWh Riverina Energy Storage System 2 and the 25 MW/50 MWh Darlington Point Energy Storage System.
Sydney-headquartered Edify, which last month announced it had completed the financing for the project, said the energy storage systems will use Tesla Megapack technology teamed with grid-forming inverters that operate in ‘virtual synchronous generator’ mode.
“This will allow the storage system to operate in a manner akin to a conventional generator and provide crucial system strength services to help facilitate the connection of future clean energy power plants in the region,” the company said.
ARENA said the entire project, which plans to connect into Transgrid’s network via the Darlington Point Substation, will help future-proof the Darlington Point area as renewable energy generation continues to expand in south-western NSW.

“Edify’s battery will be one of the most advanced battery systems in the National Electricity Market (NEM) once built, further extending the capabilities of large-scale batteries equipped with advanced inverter technology by demonstrating that they can substitute for more traditional forms of synchronous generation and synchronous condensers,” ARENA said.
“The battery could help improve system strength in a weak part of the grid, unlocking opportunities to support more renewable energy generation.”
ARENA acting chief executive officer Chris Faris said large-scale batteries are now being seen as more than just energy storage devices for the grid.
“To support the rapid transformation of our electricity system, large-scale batteries will need to evolve to do more than just store energy,” he said. “They need to be equipped with advanced inverters that can provide critical grid stability services to keep the system safe and secure, especially as synchronous generators retire and renewables provide a higher share of supply.”
Faris said large-scale batteries like Edify’s Darlington Point battery are not only firming renewable energy but are also strengthening the grid, “particularly in regional areas, where they will help to unlock more renewable uptake”.
“Edify has been one of the early adopters and pioneers of large-scale batteries in Australia. Having worked together on the Gannawarra battery, we’re excited to be supporting them once again in deploying new battery technologies to strengthen the grid as we transition,” he said.
ARENA stressed that the Darlington Point project is not among the 12 large-scale batteries that were last week shortlisted as part of a $100 million competitive funding round for grid-scale batteries equipped with advanced inverter technologies. The shortlisted projects have a capacity of more than 3000 MW and 7000 MWh of battery capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/11/porsche-backed-conglomerate-targets-renewable-energy-fuels-facility-in-tasmania/,"EV,HYDROGEN,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,TASMANIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 11, 2022",Porsche-backed conglomerate targets renewable energy fuels facility in Tasmania,"Chile’s HIF (Highly Innovative Fuels) Global, a conglomerate including German sports car manufacturer Porsche, multinational oil and gas giant ExxonMobil and German industrial heavyweight Siemens Energy, is seeking environmental approval from Tasmania to produce green hydrogen from renewable energy using 250 MW of electrolyser capacity to manufacture carbon-neutral e-fuels.
HIF Asia Pacific, a wholly owned subsidiary of HIF Global, has filed a Notice of Intent with the Tasmanian Environment Protection Authority (EPA) seeking approval for the facility, which would be located about 30 kilometres from Burnie in the state’s north-west.
“Australia has exceptional renewable energy resources that can be transformed into liquid fuels and used in existing engines,” HIF Global president and chief executive officer Cesar Norton said in a statement. “Today, we begin the first step in Tasmania to produce hydrogen from renewable energy, capture carbon dioxide from a biogenic source and produce highly competitive e-fuels that will be the carbon-neutral energy of tomorrow.”
HIF said the 250 MW facility would use renewables to produce green hydrogen. This would then be combined with carbon dioxide taken from the atmosphere or a waste source to produce synthetic methanol and converted into e-fuel that that can be directly substituted for fossil fuels in conventional internal combustion engines.

The company said further processing can be used to produce LPG, as well as specialised fuel that can be used in the road transport, maritime and aviation industries.
HIF Asia Pacific chief executive officer Ignacio Hernandez said the Tasmania Carbon Neutral eFuel Facility is expected to produce up to 100 million litres of electricity-based fuel a year. Construction of the plant is due to commence in 2024 with the facility becoming operational in the first half of 2026.
“We look forward to working with our Australian partners as we develop this facility, which will help revolutionise the decarbonisation of global transportation,” Hernandez said.
Porsche, which earlier this year paid US$75 million (AU$99 million) for a 12.5% stake in HIF, is expected to be the primary user of the e-fuel produced at the Tasmanian facility which the company said will be able to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by about 260,000 tonnes per annum and decarbonise some 52,000 vehicles.
The car manufacturer, which has previously announced plans for 80% of its new cars to be electric by the end of the decade, is backing e-fuel as an alternative to electrification, allowing its existing vehicles to continue operation.

Michael Steiner, a member of Porsche’s research and development board, said electricity-based synthetic fuels allow combustion engines to be operated in a potentially almost carbon-neutral manner.
“We see ourselves as pioneers in e-fuels and want to drive the technology forward,” he said. “E-fuels will make it possible to reduce fossil carbon emissions in combustion engines by up to 90%. This fits in with our clear overall sustainability strategy. It means that Porsche as a whole can be net carbon neutral as early as 2030. Fuels produced with renewable energy can make a contribution to this.”
The Tasmanian plant would be the third e-fuel production hub for HIF, which is currently constructing a plant in southern Chile and has plans to build another in the United States starting in 2023.
“Our global plan is to produce over 8 billion litres a year of carbon neutral e-fuels – enough to decarbonise 5 million vehicles,” Norton said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/11/no-let-up-in-sight-for-polysilicon-price-hikes/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,WORLD",MAX HALL,"JULY 11, 2022",No let-up in sight for polysilicon price hikes,"From pv magazine Global 
Amid continuing problems for Chinese polysilicon production, one analyst has predicted the price of the solar panel input material will “soon” breach CNY 300 (AU$65.5) per kg.
The latest bulletin issued by the Asia Europe Clean Energy (Solar) Advisory (AECEA) reported the poly price has risen 25% since the start of the year, to hit an 11-year high of CNY 291/kg in early July.
A recent fire at a production base and planned maintenance at five factories – on top of the ongoing Covid-19 and logistics disruption – prompted the in-country consultant to reverse the prediction it made in June that prices would fall back to CNY 220/kg in September and CNY 190/kg in December. That outcome, the AECEA said this week, is now “rather unlikely.”
While solar manufacturers have previously made much of their ability to pass price rises on to customers, hikes of 18%, 12%, and 8% in the price of solar wafers, cells, and modules, respectively, since the start of the year may have altered that dynamic. The AECEA cited a module procurement order which had included a price ceiling of CNY 1.98 per W of generation capacity and suggested other developers may follow suit.
That prospect, in turn, is prodding module makers “roughly a dozen … among them several first-tier companies,” according to the analyst, to consider pausing factory production.
So much for a voluntary production hiatus. Solar companies might also face the prospect of enforced closures for a second winter running, AECEA reported, if the upstream solar factories wanted by provincial governments to hit climate carbon scorecard targets set by Beijing drive up electricity consumption.
Provinces are already trying to attract factories by linking production investment to solar project capacity awards, as the Indian government has done.
In terms of the polysilicon price, the AECEA predicts supply will remain tight until the end of September. The nation added an impressive 23.71 GW of solar generation capacity in the first five months of the year, prompting the China Renewable Energy Engineering Institute to expect “up to 100 GW” this year. The AECEA, however, stuck to its expectation of 80-90 GW, thanks to the price turmoil.
The consultant re-emphasised Chinese dominance of solar production by referring to recently published statistics by the China PV Industry Association which indicated the country produced 98% of the world’s silicon wafers in 2021, and 85% of the combined global output of polysilicon, wafers, cells, and modules.
One company, TCL Zhonghuan, churned out around a quarter of the world’s solar wafers in 2021, the AECEA added. Ongoing plans to ramp up poly production mean China is likely to replicate its wafer dominance in that segment of the supply chain in the “not too distant future,” according to the industry commentator.
On the technology front, the analyst predicted China will host 15-20 GW of mass-production heterojunction solar fabs in 2022, with only 3 GW of it for R&D purposes. Yunnan province, the AECEA reported, has predicted commercially available products will have a conversion efficiency of more than 25% by 2024.
While perovskite solar is yet to have a similar impact, the analyst pointed out the decision by battery company Catl to invest in the technology could prove a game-changer.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/11/study-shows-solar-panel-output-exceeds-energy-input-by-100-times/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 11, 2022",Study shows solar panel output exceeds energy input by 100 times,"Maxeon, which sells in Australia under the SunPower Maxeon brand, said a third-party study to assess the energy pay-back time (EPBT) for its Maxeon 3 panels had confirmed the energy produced over the technology’s lifetime far exceeds the energy required in its production.
Maxeon said it had engaged an external consultant to assess its technology’s EPBT, which is the period required for a renewable energy system to generate the same amount of energy that was used to produce the system itself.
The EPBT assessed the cumulative energy demand (CED) over all the life cycle stages of the Maxeon 3 panels and considered local grid efficiencies for different global locations, including Australia.
The test found that Maxeon 3 solar panels had an energy payback period ranging from 0.13 to 0.45 years for ground-mounted modules, and 0.27 to 0.92 years for a residential rooftop system.
Spread over the 40-year performance warranty on the panels, the energy output exceeds the energy demand of manufacturing by more than 100 times over its lifetime, marking a significant milestone for the sustainability of PV technology.
“We are delighted with the progress Maxeon has made in the past year and look forward to Powering Positive Change in a sustainable and innovative way,” Maxeon chief legal officer Lindsey Wiedmann said.
“As a solar company, we have a responsibility to fight climate change and must continue to innovate to impact on communities around the world and to continue to generate long-term value for our employees, customers and stakeholders.”
The results are included in the company’s latest Sustainability Report which also provides a detailed overview of the company’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) achievements, initiatives, and future plans. The 96-page report also outlines the company’s 2025 and 2030 long-term ESG targets.
“Maxeon strives to maintain its sustainability leadership position in the solar industry by continuing our development of more efficient, sustainable and longer-lasting panels that can ensure easy access to solar for all,” Maxeon chief executive officer Jeff Waters said. “As more countries and corporations pledge to achieve net-zero emissions, renewable energy will play a pivotal role in enabling this transition. Maxeon is delighted to be a key player in the race to achieving net-zero by supporting the growing demand for solar energy coupled with social and governance best practices.”
Maxeon said it delivered 899 MW of solar panels in 2021 which led to more than 52 million tons of carbon emissions abatement for the year.
It also committed to decreasing both the energy intensity and carbon intensity of manufacturing its panels from 2020 levels by 10% in 2025 and 20% in 2030.
Maxeon, which introduced a 40-year solar panel warranty in early 2022, also revealed that the maximum number of defective parts per million (DPPM) in sales contracts had declined from 2,000 in 2020 to 187 in 2021.
