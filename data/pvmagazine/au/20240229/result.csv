The CER said the not-for-profit organisation is a new entity established to carry out its functions independently while being accountable to the regulator. It takes the place of the Clean Energy Council (CEC) which served as the accreditation body for installers and designers over the past decade.
The CER said the CEC’s accreditation services have ceased with SAA’s accreditation scheme now in effect.
Stephen Robertson, Chair of the newly launched SAA, said the announcement is a significant milestone in the commitment to enhancing standards, transparency and accountability across the solar energy sector.
“Today marks the beginning of a new era for Australia’s dedicated and highly skilled solar installers and designers, with the launch of an independent, not-for-profit and single-purpose entity to support compliance and raise standards across the industry,” he said.
“SAA is committed to ensuring integrity, accountability and responsible practices within our industry.”
The regulator said all accredited installers and designers under the SRES must transfer to SAA before June 2024 to remain eligible for small-scale technology certificates (STCs). There is no fee to transfer accreditation with SAA to accept all current CEC accreditation expiry dates and fees paid. If however the accreditation has expired, installers and designers must gain accreditation with SAA to remain eligible for STCs.
SAA said there are no immediate proposed changes to accreditation requirements with professional development completed under the CEC’s accreditation scheme to be recognised for the first 12 months of the new scheme.
CER Renewable Energy Target branch General Manager Matthew Power said the regulator is looking forward to working with SAA to both maintain and continue to improve the training and performance of accredited installers for high-quality installations.
“The small-scale rooftop solar sector has been growing in Australia with 3.1 GW installed in 2023, well up from the 2.8 GW installed in 2022. We believe there is potential for ongoing growth,” he said.
“Consumers and businesses who are increasingly turning to rooftop solar to control their energy bills can remain confident that accredited installers and designers have the necessary training and skills.”
The announcement has been welcomed by industry with Smart Energy Council Chief Executive John Grimes saying it will help to ensure solar designers and installers meet the highest standards of quality, sustainability and service,
“The industry wanted to see a collaborative whole-of-industry approach to accreditation delivered by a separate and independent body,” he said. “That is what SAA is delivering from today to support the federal government’s ongoing commitment to program integrity.”
The CEC did not apply to be an accreditation scheme operator.

1,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/29/glenrowan-solar-farm-reaches-full-capacity-in-quick-time/,"INSTALLATIONS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,2024-02-29,Glenrowan Solar Farm reaches full capacity in quick time,"The 102 Glenrowan Solar Farm is now fully commissioned having passed the hold point testing just three months after first production in December 2023 and less than one year after construction proper commenced.
Testing and commissioning of the 245-hectare solar farm, the first project to be delivered under Victoria’s second renewable energy target auction (VRET2), began in November 2023 after it achieved first energisation on 21 November. Construction of the power plant commenced in March 2023.
James Brennan, Renewable Energy Connections Manager for UGL which constructed the solar farm for fellow Cimic Group subsidiary Pacific Partnerships, said a revised connection and commissioning process had paved the way for the quick delivery.
“Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) Vic and National Connections team worked with our project team to develop a streamlined connection and commissioning process to focus on priority tests and accelerate progress through the hold point testing process,” he said via social media.
“The results speak for themselves, as we were able to progress through the entire hold point testing process from 0 MW to 102 MW in just a handful of working weeks.”
The Glenrowan Solar Farm, located about 250 kilometres north of Melbourne in Victoria’s planned North East Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), comprises approximately 226,000 solar panels installed on 2,200 trackers.
The facility is connected to the grid via AusNet’s nearby Glenrowan Terminal Substation and is expected to generate enough independent electricity to power about 45,000 Australian homes.
The solar farm is the first of six solar farm projects to be delivered under the VRET2 and is backed by a 10-year power purchase agreement with the state government.
The state government has said the project will help meet Victoria’s legislated renewable energy targets of 40% by 2025 and 50% by 2030 and will also help satisfy the state’s new renewable energy storage target of at least 2.6 GW of energy storage capacity by 2030 and 6.3 GW of storage by 2035.

The extension is the second time Fortescue has pushed back its final decision on the project, announcing in December it had moved the deadline from the end of that month to 28 February 2024. The companies will now have until 31 March 2024 to complete a final financial investment decision.
The parties have also agreed to extend the sunset date for achieving financial close on the proposed 2 GW multi-stage Bulli Creek solar and battery project being developed by Genex in Queensland’s southeast to 30 April 2025.
Genex and development partner J-Power, with Solar Choice as a co-developer, are developing the Bulli Creek solar and battery project in Queensland for an offtake for up to 337.5 MW of solar energy to Fortescue.
The power purchase agreement represents about 20% of the renewable power Fortescue needs under its plans to produce up to 70,000 tonnes of green hydrogen at Gibson Island annually, which will then be used to produce up to 400,000 tonnes of green ammonia each year for export.
The deal with Fortescue, first announced in October 2023, will enable Genex to commit to the first solar stage development at Bulli Creek at a minimum capacity of 450 MW, with the deal providing a 75% contracted revenue stream.
Genex said in addition to the Fortescue deal, the company is also continuing discussions with other parties for further solar offtake which would allow the initial capacity of the project to be increased to up to 775 MW.
Genex said it expects those discussions will conclude and the size of the Bulli Creek project will be confirmed by mid-2024 which will support the target of a final investment decision for the first stage of the project later this year.

3,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/29/unlocking-the-green-vault-superannuation-funds-could-be-missing-link-in-renewable-energy-progress/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,2024-02-29,Unlocking the green vault: Superannuation funds could be missing link in renewable energy progress,"The first half of 2023 marked a critical juncture, showcasing the slowest pace of final approvals for new wind and solar farms in the Clean Energy Council’s (CEC) six-year tracking history.
In addition to the sluggish project approvals, persistent transmission challenges, financing obstacles, and community disapprovals continue to limit the green industry from reaching its potential. These setbacks emphasise the urgency for innovative approaches to propel the clean energy sector forward.
Recognising this, the corporate sector’s commitment to the green journey is pivotal in fast-tracking the achievement of the nation’s clean energy targets. Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers’ draft laws mandating companies to disclose climate-related risks represent a commendable first step, but we must not stop here.
Once enacted, Treasurer Chalmers’ proposed laws will elevate climate reporting to the same level as traditional financial disclosures, a move that will reshape the landscape for investors, banks, and corporations. Nevertheless, it is essential to explore additional measures that can further catalyse the transition to a sustainable and low-carbon future.
I propose that the government consider legislation mandating superannuation funds to invest in a portion of renewable energy initiatives. Industry superannuation funds represent a colossal pool of capital, boasting $3.5 trillion (USD 2.27 trillion) in assets according to the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia. By directing a fraction of these funds towards clean energy projects, we can unlock billions in private capital, providing a powerful impetus for Australia’s clean energy transition.
This strategic allocation of funds holds the potential to address the challenges faced in meeting renewable energy targets. Not only does it provide financial support for new projects, but it also aligns the superannuation industry with the broader goals of sustainability and environmental responsibility. The financial influence of super funds, when harnessed for clean energy initiatives, can play a pivotal role in accelerating Australia’s shift towards a more sustainable and low-carbon future.
It’s worth mentioning that funds currently see companies that are developing and deploying new technologies or operating in areas of significant public policy change as higher risk. That’s a big reason why new green technologies struggle to attract institutional capital compared to those based on fossil fuels.
The government could amend the best-financial-interest duty so individuals can instruct their funds to invest their money in projects that reduce long-term and systemic financial risks such as climate change. A tax break or a matching contribution from the government could also encourage individuals to choose sustainable investment options.
Additionally, by offering government guarantees, partial assurances on green energy investments made by superannuation funds can effectively mitigate risks, enhancing the attractiveness of such investments while fostering environmentally friendly initiatives.
Introducing targeted tax incentives for superannuation funds and allocating a designated portion of their portfolios to green energy investments could serve as a powerful encouragement for sustainable investment. These incentives might include tax credits, reduced capital gains taxes, or accelerated depreciation specifically tailored for qualifying renewable energy projects.
Treasurer Chalmers’ expressed openness to some of these reforms is an encouraging sign, and indicates a willingness to explore innovative solutions. It’s undeniably imperative to delve deeper into the idea of mandating super funds to invest in renewables. By doing so, we can ensure that Australia maximises the potential of its financial resources, leaving a lasting impact on the trajectory of the nation’s clean energy landscape.
For engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firms, the dedicated investment of superannuation funds in renewable energy holds profound significance on a broader scale. Such financial backing not only accelerates the clean energy transition but also serves as a catalyst for substantial growth within the EPC sector.
The infusion of capital into renewable projects not only ensures a steady pipeline of opportunities but also fosters innovation and technological advancements. As EPC firms play a pivotal role in the development and execution of renewable energy projects, a reliable and substantial source of funding enhances their capacity to meet the increasing demand for sustainable infrastructure.
In light of the urgent need for federal policy reform, unlocking more superannuation for green investment becomes a necessity. This approach harnesses the power and preferences of individual members, aligning financial decisions with environmental goals. By taking bold steps to redirect superannuation funds towards renewable projects, Australia can not only address climate impacts but also contribute significantly to a more sustainable and resilient future.

ACEN’s Australian portfolio already exceeds more than 1 GW capacity of large-scale renewable energy generation under construction and in operation, with an additional 8 GW of solar, wind, battery, and pumped hydro projects in the development pipeline.
ACEN Australia Managing Director David Pollington said securing the green term loans, each with a four-year tenor, is a vote of confidence in the company’s strategic direction and capacity to deliver on the promise of renewable energy.
“Our focus remains on the responsible deployment of capital to ensure the timely delivery of our projects whilst striving for operational excellence,” he said. “We are building on our track record as we significantly contribute to Australia’s renewable energy transition.”
Acen has previously outlined plans to invest $6 billion in Australia as part of a broader strategy to expand its renewable energy capacity here and in the wider Asia-Pacific region to 20 GW by 2030.
The company’s Australian projects include the 720 MW New England Solar Farm being developed near Uralla in northern New South Wales (NSW). The 400 MW first stage of the facility is now operational with work on the stage two continuing.
Construction has also commenced on the 400 MW Stubbo Solar Farm being developed in the NSW central west.
Other projects in ACEN’s Australian development portfolio include the 600 MW Birriwa, the 320 MW Narragamba, and the 320 MW Deeargee solar farms, and the proposed 800 MW, 12-hour Phoenix pumped hydro project, all in NSW.
It has also started construction of the 190 MW Axedale Solar Farm in Victoria and has teamed with the Yindibarndi Energy Corporation to develop a 3 GW solar and battery storage project in Western Australia.
ACEN Treasurer Cecile Cruzabra said the company’s partnership with Australian financial institutions like ANZ and Westpac is a clear indication of the growing appetite for sustainable investment opportunities in Australia.
“It underscores the essential role that the financial sector plays in propelling the global shift towards a Net Zero future,” she said. “This green term loan goes beyond funding, it’s an investment in our shared vision for a renewable-powered Australia and a cleaner planet.”
ANZ Executive Director David Simmons said the transaction aligns with the bank’s commitment to finance $100 billion in social and environmental outcomes by 2030.

TrinaTracker has developed an upgraded version of its Vanguard 1P Smart Tracking Solution. The new product has a maximum tracker length of 140 meters and can be equipped with more than 700 W of N-type modules.
“The improved model boasts a cutting-edge multi-motor system equipped with a slewing drive and a bi-damper system,” the company said in a statement.  “Its innovative design facilitates the construction of longer trackers while minimizing oscillation time, averting instabilities, improving dynamic response, and raising the critical wind speed threshold. The multi-motor feature guarantees precise tracking under the most challenging conditions.”
The upgraded version has a tracking range of 60 degrees on a single axis in a single row. The steel frame features a coating of hot-dip galvanized (HDG), pre-galvanized, and zinc-magnesium Alloy (ZM).
“The upgraded system greatly increases installation efficiency,” TrinaTracker said. “The introduction of shrink tube technology has effectively halved the time needed for tube connections. Furthermore, the integration of a patented spherical bearing greatly enhances terrain adaptability, making it much easier to assemble the tracker and reducing the extra forces caused by misalignment.”

Other enhancements include an upgrade to Trina Smart Cloud, which allows greater efficiency with operations and maintenance, along with better system security. The product’s tracking algorithm, the SuperTrack Algorithm, has also been modified and improved.
“It has undergone significant advances, expanding its range of application settings while autonomously identifying, training and optimising itself, resulting in a marked increase in energy production of up to 8%,” the company said. “This additional energy yield is attributed to the combined effect of its two algorithms: STA, which boosts energy generation in overcast conditions, and SBA, specifically designed to reduce row-to-row shadows in uneven terrain.”
The tracking solution includes Trina’s Smart Controller. It consumes 0.04 kWh per day and has a tracking accuracy of less than 1 degree. It weighs less than 5 kg and can operate in temperatures between -30 C and 60 C.

The battery, partially funded by Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) which is providing $24 million toward the project as part of the $176 million Large Scale Battery Storage Funding Round, will feature grid-forming inverters supplied by German-headquartered solar and storage solution provider SMA.  These will allow the battery to provide system stability services to the region’s growing number of wind and solar farms.
ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said Origin’s decision to proceed highlights the increased confidence in grid-forming inverter technology and the strong market incentives driving investment in battery storage.
“As traditional forms of energy generation are phased out, new clean technologies are required to take their place. Large-scale batteries can play a significant role in providing system stability services, particularly when fitted with advanced grid-forming inverters,” he said.
Miller said ARENA’s funding has been integral to creating smarter batteries with this technology with the Mortlake battery the fifth project to have been committed under the funding round, with three more to go across Australia.
Other batteries that were successful in the ARENA funding round and have been financially committed include Neoen’s 270 MW / 540 MWh Western Downs battery in Queensland, the 200 MW / 400 MWh Blyth battery in South Australia, and the 300 MW / 450 MWh Victorian Big Battery. AGL has also secured funding for a 500 MW / 2 GWh battery to be developed at the site of its coal-fired Liddell power plant in the New South Wales Hunter Valley.
The Mortlake battery is being developed next to Origin’s 566 MW gas-fired power station at Mortlake, and progresses the company’s goal of growing its portfolio of renewable energy generation and storage capacity to 4 GW by the end of the decade.
Expected to be commissioned late in 2026, the Mortlake BESS is also adjacent to the Moorabool to Heywood 500 kV transmission line, within Victoria’s South-West Renewable Energy Zone.

7,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/29/net-metering-move-puts-indonesias-3-6-gw-rooftop-solar-goal-at-risk/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,INDONESIA",PATRICK JOWETT,2024-02-29,Net metering move puts Indonesia’s 3.6 GW rooftop solar goal at risk,"From pv magazine Global
Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) has enacted MEMR Regulation No. 2/2024, which abolishes net metering for rooftop PV installations.
The country first introduced net metering in November 2018. It allowed solar project owners to export excess electricity to the grid, which is operated by state utility PT PLN, in order to reduce their electricity bills. Several improvements to the scheme have been enacted since the regulation’s inception.
The latest policy amendment, which went into force on Jan. 30, guarantees that customers who have already installed rooftop solar systems before this date remain bound by the previous regulation for the next 10 years.
Marlistya Citraningrum, program manager for the Jakarta-based Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR), told pv magazine that the 10-year rule will apply to projects that have been approved but not installed, as well as arrays that have already been approved and installed.
“As an on-grid rooftop PV user, I actually have questions about this transitional rule,” Citraningrum said. “considering that during installation, rooftop PV exports are still calculated as equivalent to 0.65 of the electricity tariff based on Permen ESDM No. 49/2018, not 1:1 like Permen ESDM No. 26/2021. This transitional rule needs to be clearly informed to current rooftop solar power users.”
The IESR believes the loss of net metering will “make it difficult” for Indonesia to achieve the government’s National Strategic Project target of 3.6 GW of rooftop solar by 2025 and a 23% renewable energy target set for the same year.
Fabby Tumiwa, the executive director of the Institute for Essential Services Reform, said that household or small business customers will delay the adoption of rooftop PV because their peak electricity demand occurs at night, while PV generates peak energy during the day. Tumiwa said that without net-metering, rooftop PV investment will become more expensive.
“Net metering is actually an incentive for household customers to use rooftop solar systems. With PLN’s controlled electricity tariffs, net-metering helps improve the economic viability of rooftop solar systems installed at a minimum capacity of 2 kWp to 3 kWp for R1 category consumers,” Tumiwa said. “Without net-metering and the relatively high cost of batteries, this minimum capacity cannot be met, resulting in higher investment costs per kilowatt-peak unit. This will reduce the economics of rooftop solar systems.”
Citraningrum told pv magazine that while no official explanation has been given for the change, it is “likely that financial constraints of PLN is one of the main reasons.” She said the end of net metering will not benefit residential and small business PV users but will have little impact on commercial and industrial-scale PV users, as many of them do not export excess energy. Instead, she said she hopes the decision will “trigger more energy storage use and thus contribute to bringing the cost down.”
Figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) show that at the end of 2022, Indonesia had 291 MW of installed solar capacity.
