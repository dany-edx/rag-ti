Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the government funding will help build the infrastructure needed for the proposed Hunter Hydrogen Hub which would produce green hydrogen from recycled water sources and renewable electricity generated by Origin’s portfolio, using a grid-connected 55 MW electrolyser.
It is expected the plant, to be established at the Port of Newcastle, will produce up to 5,500 tonnes of green hydrogen each year with most of the output to be used by the Orica ammonia and ammonium nitrate facility on Newcastle’s Kooragang Island. Hydrogen will also be made available for refuelling hydrogen buses and trucks at the hub.
Origin said it has yet to reach a final investment decision on the project, which is to be designed in such a way that hydrogen production could be scaled up to potentially export the fuel in future, with engineering design work still under way, and environmental approvals still to be secured.
Construction of the facility is expected to begin in 2025 with operations to commence in 2026.

Bowen has described green hydrogen as renewable hydrogen as “an essential part of Australia’s renewable energy transformation” and said the Hunter Hydrogen Hub would help give the hydrogen industry its springboard to scale.
“This project is the next step towards using locally produced renewable hydrogen in Australia to reduce our industrial emissions and develop a renewable export future,” he said.
The Hunter Hydrogen Hub funding is part of the Australian government’s $500 million Regional Hydrogen Hubs Program which is investing more than $500 million in up to seven hydrogen hubs across the country.
The funding announcement comes just 24 hours after Origin and Orica inked formal agreements with the Port of Newcastle to support the development of a clean energy precinct.

The port said it has formalised memoranda of understanding (MoU) agreements with 15 major domestic and international companies, including Japanese industrial giant Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Korean power utility KEPCO, and Fortescue Future Industries.
Project Lead and the Port of Newcastle’s Chief Commercial Officer, Simon Byrnes, said the Clean Energy Precinct MoUs spanned collaboration on the development of inland and offshore wind projects, electricity transmission and water supply, clean energy production, clean energy storage, distribution and export facilities, export and bunkering, skills and training pathways, advanced manufacturing and innovation hubs.
Port of Newcastle Chief Executive Officer Craig Carmody acknowledged that “there is a long way to go to make this project a reality” but said the “once in a generation” project is at the centre of the port’s future diversification strategy.
“Our dedicated 220-hectare clean energy precinct will offer the perfect platform for large-scale clean energy production, which will be supported by common user, open access, shared infrastructure across clean energy storage, transport and export facilities servicing production from the precinct itself and from right across the Hunter region,” he said.
The port’s announcement came on the same day that the federal government officially declared the Hunter Coast an offshore wind zone, expected to generate up to 5 GW of wind energy.

“NSW Ambulance paramedics treated a 41-year-old man at the scene, however he could not be revived,” police said in a statement.
Police said a crime scene had been established at the Goolma Road site with specialist police called in to examine the scene.
The 425 MWp Wellington North Solar Farm is being developed by British-headquartered company Lightsource bp, an equal joint venture between solar developer Lightsource and oil giant bp.
It is believed the worker was a subcontractor for Spanish engineering, procurement, and construction contractor GRS which has been appointed to oversee the delivery of the project.
In a statement issued on Thursday, a Lightsource bp spokesperson said the company was unable to provide any more details about the man’s death.
“Lightsource bp is deeply saddened to confirm that a worker has passed away following a medical emergency at its Wellington North site on Wednesday 12 July 2023,” the company said.
“Our team is working closely with emergency services and is supporting all external investigations conducted by authorities and the principal contractor on site. We cannot confirm any further details at this stage.”
“We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the family, friends and colleagues of the worker during this very difficult time.”
The tragic incident comes less than two weeks after a solar installer in Queensland died following a workplace accident in Brisbane.
Queensland police said a 43-year-old man had suffered fatal injuries on 29 June 2023 when he fell several metres and landed on concrete after crashing through the roof of a workplace in Wynnum in Brisbane’s east.
The man was cleaning solar panels on top of an automotive shop when it’s believed a fibreglass roofing panel gave way when he stood on it.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/13/countrywide-nears-final-decision-on-tasmanian-green-hydrogen-projects/,"HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,TASMANIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 13, 2023",Countrywide nears final decision on Tasmanian green hydrogen projects,"Countrywide, a wholly owned subsidiary of Queensland-based independent power producer ReNu Energy, is developing a 5 MW green hydrogen production plant at Brighton near Hobart in Tasmania’s south and another at Western Junction near Bell Bay in the state’s north.
The hydrogen will be produced via electrolysis with renewable power planned to be initially sourced from the state’s grid, with subsequent supply from behind-the-meter solar and power purchase agreements from wind, solar and hydro operators.
Both projects will also include a hydrogen refuelling station (HRS), with a third HRS planned for a site at Burnie in the state’s northwest.
Countrywide, working in collaboration with global engineering company Wood, said United States-based hydrogen technology company Plug Power would supply the electrolyser systems to be installed at the Brighton and Western Junction plants.
Plug Power will initially deliver two 5 MW proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers, each designed to produce up to 2,100 kilograms of hydrogen per day with Countrywide targeting the domestic market, including the road transport sector and industrial customers.
Countrywide said both projects have been designed to allow for the installation of a second 5 MW electrolyser when demand at either site exceeds 2,000 kg of hydrogen per day.
New Zealand-based engineering firm Fabrum Solutions will supply the HRS at all three projects sites with each station to include a refueller hub and hydrogen tube trailer storage system.
Australian-based construction contractor Wasco has been selected to work with Fabrum on the construction and balance of works for the projects.
ReNu Energy Executive Chairman Boyd White said the appointments will serve to assure potential customers in Tasmania that the projects are on track for first production and supply by mid-2025.
“A significant amount of work has been completed during the last six months in progressing the technical side of Countrywide Hydrogen’s Tasmania green hydrogen projects,” he said. “The culmination of that work is the technology and supplier selection and design for our projects.”
White said Countrywide would now look to commence final design and complete the relevant contractual documentation to deliver the projects.
As well as the Tasmanian projects, Countrywide said it is also developing and 3 MW project in Indonesia and two renewable hydrogen projects in Victoria, including a 10 MW production plant planned for Portland in the state’s southwest.

The VoltStorage VDIUM C50 is an AC-coupled battery with a system voltage of 48 V. The manufacturer offers a 20-year guarantee on the electrolyte and promises that it will degrade less than 0.3% per year.
It also offers a five-year guarantee on the power electronics. The new product comes in a common container and weighs 2 tons without the electrolyte. When fully filled, it weighs 6.5 tons. The electrolyte pumps and power electronics consume 40 W in standby mode.
The system can be cascaded in a 10-unit configuration and reach a total capacity of 500 kWh. The discharge capacity is 9 kW. At full power, the system is empty after six hours.
The manufacturer said that the system, thanks to the redox technology, can achieve a depth of discharge of 100%. When charging the system, operators should plan six hours for 80% and nine hours for 100%. At 10 kW, the charging power is slightly higher than the discharging power.
VoltStorage also said the system features an IP54 protection rating. It recommends installing it in an outdoor environment.
