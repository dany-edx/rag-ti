The DK BESS 2 project will see large-scale batteries distributed across locations on the Darwin-Katherine Interconnected System (DKIS) to enable more solar energy penetration by providing essential frequency and voltage control services.
Expressions of interest for the project have already been called and the assessment of submissions is now underway. The government said successful applicants will be asked to put forward a proposal for the project.
Commissioning of the battery energy storage solution is targeted from 2026 onwards.
Northern Territory Chief Minister Eva Lawler said the DK BESS 2 project, in conjunction with the first big battery, will satisfy the Darwin-Katherine Electricity System Plan requirement for the installation of up to 105 MW of high-specification batteries.
“Battery technology will play a significant role in our target of reaching 50% renewable energy consumption by 2030, so the DK BESS and DK BESS 2 are an important part of our transition to a renewable energy future,” she said.
The announcement comes as the 35 MW / 35 MWh Darwin-Katherine battery, built at the Channel Island Power Station in Darwin, progresses through its testing phase. The installation, construction and pre-commissioning of the battery is now complete and it is moving towards full-scale commissioning. It is expected to come online later this year.
The battery is forecast to deliver cost savings of about $9.8 million annually, paying for itself in about five years from connection to the grid, and delivering annual carbon emission savings of 58,000 tonnes.
Gerhard Laubscher, CEO of Territory Generation which owns the DK BESS projects in partnership with NT Power and Water Corporation, said the battery projects will play a critical role in advancing renewables in the Darwin-Katherine electricity system and other power systems across the Territory.
“Adding more battery energy storage systems to Territory Generation’s portfolio will not only enable more renewables and efficient generation dispatch throughout the energy transition, but also fosters the evolution of technological innovations and further supports grid resilience,” he said.

Australia’s largest private satellite yet, Optimus-1 is one of the 53 payloads launched into space as part of American spacecraft manufacturer Space X’s Transporter-10 rideshare mission launched from the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.
The 270-kilogram Optimus orbital servicing vehicle is to be deployed in an orbital slot where it will then commence its full testing campaign. Part of that will be an investigation of the CSIRO’s printed flexible solar cells that were attached to the surface of the satellite.
The CSIRO is exploring the potential of printed flexible solar cells as a reliable energy source for future space endeavors with the organisation’s Space Program Director, Dr Kimberley Clayfield, saying a major challenge in the development of spacecraft is low-mass, high-efficiency power systems.
“CSIRO’s printed flexible solar cells could provide a reliable, lightweight energy solution for future space operations and exploration,” she said.
“If the space flight test reveals similar performance as we’ve shown in the lab, this technology offers significant advantages over traditional silicon-based solar.”

CSIRO Renewable Energy Systems Group Leader Dr Anthony Chesman said CSIRO-developed perovskite cells have the potential to transform spacecraft power systems and enable new possibilities for future space missions.
“Our perovskite cells have been achieving incredible outcomes on earth and we’re excited that they’ll soon be showcasing their potential in space,” he said, adding that in situ testing would secure information on the performance of the cells as they orbit the planet.
“We will get information on how the panels are holding up under the extreme conditions in space and data on the efficiency they achieve,” he said.
Chesman said the team had already undertaken pioneering research on the likely performance of the cells in a space environment.
“Based on our research we expect our printed flexible solar cells will stand up to the effects of cosmic electron and gamma radiation which can compromise the performance and integrity of traditional solar cells,” he said.
“We are also confident these cells will outperform traditional cells in cases where sunlight hits them at non-optimal angles.
“The feedback we receive from the satellite will provide valuable insights into the practical application of our technology and inform future technology development.”

2,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/05/fixing-national-electricity-market-for-renewable-energy-future/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,2024-03-05,Fixing National Electricity Market for renewable energy future,"Unsurprisingly, rooftop solar output is growing fast. In 2022, one in three homes had solar panels. Total rooftop solar capacity exceeded 30 gigawatts, compared to the remaining 21GW of coal generation.
Rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems will soon supply half of our electricity demand. At times of the day, they already supply close to 100% of electricity demand and in some regions can briefly meet all demand.

This means renewable energy is displacing the electricity traded through the wholesale market and supplied via the transmission system. The National Electricity Market (NEM) is the wholesale market where large generators and retailers buy and sell electricity to supply the eastern and south-eastern states. It was never designed to cope with large amounts of renewable energy feeding into the grid at large, medium and small scales.
The market’s design doesn’t allow for harnessing the full economic and technical potential of the millions of consumer-owned generators, known as distributed energy resources (DERs). Comprehensive market reforms are urgently needed to achieve an energy transition at least cost to energy users.
The National Electricity Market has operated largely in its current form since the 1990s. It was designed for large fossil-fuelled power stations, but many of these are on the way out.
Millions of rooftop solar systems are now connected to the grid. The market needs to change to a system that can manage and co-ordinate these small renewable energy generators.
To minimise disruption, a reformed market has to be able to accommodate and value the electricity and power system services that these millions of distributed energy resources can provide. They offer flexibility and can help balance supply and demand, thus improving grid stability.
Between 2019 and 2023, the former Energy Security Board (ESB) and regulators were tasked with delivering a new market design for the clean energy transition. Reforms to better integrate variable renewable generation included:
The Energy Security Board also proposed a two-sided market to allow energy users to actively trade electricity. The design of the reform fell short, but the intent remains valid. This reform needs to be revisited.
The electricity market rules define what commodities are valued and traded, how they are to be traded and by whom. These rules are embedded in thousands of pages of legislation. Each change takes about two years to progress.
These incremental market and policy patches fall short of the systemic change needed for a clean energy future. The whole National Electricity Market and its processes must be redefined.
The current focus of attention is on the large scale. What is being overlooked is the potential of small-scale and local generation to supply electricity where it is needed. This oversight creates a risk of building too much transmission infrastructure at great cost.
The opportunity of energy market reform is that the millions of small, privately owned, behind-the-meter generators could economically provide a big share of Australia’s future electricity and power system services.
The clean energy transition is a national priority. Change on this scale requires governments to work together to deliver economic productivity, affordable energy and climate action.
A clear set of principles is needed to guide these changes. The principles from the National Energy Transformation Partnership agreement between federal, state and territory governments are a good place to start. It recognises consumers’ needs as central to the transformation, and that a strong economy depends on affordable, clean and secure energy sources.
The agreement also recognises the role electricity networks and demand-side participation will play in the energy transition. The demand side includes all the small, behind-the-meter, grid-connected, rooftop solar systems and interruptible uses of electricity such as hot-water systems.
Reforming the electricity market is complex work. It requires an in-depth knowledge of governance and regulatory frameworks, commercial realities and consumer needs.
Putting energy users at the heart of these complex reforms requires a holistic systems thinking approach to policy and regulatory design. Such an approach takes into account how all parts of a complex system interact.
With the consumer having such a key role, the focus, planning and investment in these smaller energy sources must be on par with that given to the large generators.
Renewable Energy Zones – areas with the greatest potential to develop renewable energy projects – have shown that, with the right policy settings, billions of dollars of investment can be mobilised. The same level of focus on policy settings and market reforms is needed at the small scale of “Community Energy Zones”.
Each zone must be able to accommodate the unique characteristics of its energy users. It must create an investment environment that supports a local ecosystem of skills, trades and community benefit, ultimately leading to a zero-emission community. It must also support technological and business innovation and allow distribution networks to transition to a smart grid at low risk and low cost.
Learning from successful examples overseas such as smart local energy systems (UK) and Viable Cities (Sweden) will be crucial.

3,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/05/rapad-search-for-landholders-to-play-part-in-4-2-gw-clean-energy-corridor/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",EV FOLEY,2024-03-05,RAPAD search for landholders to play part in 4.2 GW clean energy corridor,"Landholders in western Queensland are being invited to register their interest in hosting large-scale renewable energy projects that could be connected to the proposed RAPAD (Remote Area Planning and Development board) Power Grid transmission network.
The RAPAD Power Grid project seeks to establish an estimated 930-kilometre clean energy corridor comprising 4.2 GW of solar generation and common-user battery energy storage connected to 5.2 GW of high voltage transmission line that would link the government-committed CopperString transmission project at Hughenden in the state’s northwest to the existing electricity network at Biloela.
The project is a collaboration between seven central western Queensland councils and VisIR, the parent company of CuString which originally founded and developed the CopperString project, a 1,100km transmission network that will link Mt Isa to the existing grid at Townsville, via Hughenden.
RAPAD Board Chair and Longreach Regional Council Mayor Tony Rayner said the call for expressions of interest from landholders is an important milestone for the project as it seeks to work with the local community on what he described as a transformational project.
“As we’ve seen recently in other regions, the social licence for renewable energy projects has been a massive challenge, but it can be a valuable opportunity if done well,” he said.
“We’re in a unique position with the RAPAD Power Grid project that is driven locally and focussed on working together to unlock the region’s renewable energy potential to deliver strong economic, social and environmental benefits to the central west, and all of Queensland.”
The RAPAD Power Grid project is still in the planning stage but RAPAD Acting Chief Executive Morgan Gronold said visits to geographically similar areas and communities including local projects and in the United States will be used to inform the development.
“These investigations together with our landholder EOI will provide valuable insights and networks for the RAPAD Power Grid and other regional renewable energy projects into the future,” Gronold said.
Landholders interested in exploring the opportunity are being encouraged to refer to the Queensland Farmers’ Federation (QFF) Renewable Energy Landholder Toolkit, released in 2023, to assist them in negotiations with energy industry representatives.
QFF CEO Jo Sheppard said that as the state prepares for growth in the renewable energy sector, an increasing number of landholders are being approached to host projects on their land, and it is essential that they are fully informed of the potential benefits as well as potential risks.
“The toolkit is an important resource for landholders as they work through their decision-making process,” she said.
“It will guide them through the initial stages of being approached by developers right through to the next steps should they decide to proceed with a development on their property.”

4,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/05/leapton-unveils-585-w-topcon-solar-panel-with-fiberglass-frame/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,JAPAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-03-05,Leapton unveils 585 W TOPCon solar panel with fiberglass frame,"Japan-headquartered Leapton Energy Co., Ltd. has released a new solar module based on n-type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPcon) technology.
The LP182x199M66NH modules feature 182 mm x 199 mm n-type TOPCon cells and a fiberglass frame, which the manufacturer said is more resistant to corrosion than conventional frames.
“This composite material is used in applications such as wind turbine blades, to withstand wind pressure, vibration and centrifugal force, as well as railway tracks, to withstand the pressure and vibration of passing trains,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “Fiberglass-reinforced composite materials have been used for over 20 years in outdoor environments and fields with higher load requirements, with countless successful application cases.”
Leapton is offering three versions of the panels, with power outputs ranging from 560 W to 585 W. The efficiency ratings range from 21.68% to 22.65%. The open-circuit voltage is between 47.42 V and 48.42 and the short-circuit current is between 15.00 A and 15.27 A. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
The panels measure 2,278 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weigh 28 kg. They also feature an IP68 enclosure and 3.2 mm heat-strengthened glass. They have a temperature coefficient of -0.30% per degree Celsius and an operational temperature ranging from -40 C to 85 C.
The new products come with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 25-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1.0%. The 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.4% of the nominal output power.
Leapton Energy had a capacity of 600 MW in China at the end of 2020 and 2 GW at the end of 2022.
The manufacturer recently said it will raise the its annual production capacity to 3.5 GW. “In 2021, the company completed Phase 1 expansion to reach 2 GW. Phase 2 in 2023 brings the capacity to total 3.5 GW,” Global Sales Director, Leapton Energy, Jeff Chau told pv magazine.
