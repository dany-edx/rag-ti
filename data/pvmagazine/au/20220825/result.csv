Unless Australia reduces its energy consumption, my recent study finds it’ll be almost impossible for renewable energy to replace fossil fuels by 2050. This is what’s required to reach our net-zero emissions target.
Yet, as the nation’s economy recovers from the pandemic, Australia’s energy consumption is likely to return to its pre-pandemic growth. The study identifies two principal justifications for reducing energy consumption (or “energy descent”):
Energy descent isn’t an impossible task. Indeed, in 1979, Australia’s total final energy consumption was about half that in 2021. Key to success will be transitioning to an ecologically sustainable, steady-state economy, with greener technologies and industries.
To transition to sustainable energy, Australia must electrify transport and combustion heating, while replacing all fossil-fuelled electricity with energy efficiency and renewables, which are the cheapest energy technologies.
Renewables can be rolled out rapidly: wind and solar farms can be built in just a few years and residential rooftop solar can be installed in a single day.

But rapid growth in wind and solar is slowed by three critical infrastructural and institutional requirements of the electricity industry:
These take longer than building solar and wind farms and much longer than installing rooftop solar and batteries. Nevertheless, they could be fully implemented within a decade.
In fact, transitioning existing fossil-fuelled electricity generation, such as coal-fired power stations, to 100% renewables could possibly be completed by the early 2030s.
But optimistic calculations based on how quickly we can build solar and wind farms and their infrastructure ignore the fact that the growth of renewable electricity is limited by electricity demand.
When existing coal-fired power stations have been replaced by renewables, electricity demand will be determined by how rapidly we can electrify transport and combustion heating. These are the principal tasks that will limit the future growth rate of renewable electricity. They will likely be implemented slowly, despite the urgency of climate change.
Households and industries have big investments in petrol/diesel vehicles and combustion heating. They may be reluctant to replace these working technologies, without substantial government incentives.
 
So far, effective federal government policies are almost non-existent for transitioning transport and heating, which are together responsible for 38% of Australia’s emissions.
This month’s announcement of a future “consultation” on fleet fuel efficiency standards is the government’s tentative first step.

If we look at only percentage growth rates, the task of renewable electricity looks misleadingly easy. From 2015 to 2019, Australia’s renewable electricity grew by 62% – an excellent achievement.
But, it was starting from a small base. This means its increase in energy production over that period was only slightly bigger than the growth of total final energy consumption – comprising electricity, transport and heating – which is still mostly fossil fuelled.
On the global scale, the situation is even worse. As a result of growth in total final energy consumption, the share of fossil fuels was the same in 2019 as in 2000: namely around 80%.
The challenge for renewable energy is like a runner trying to break a record while officials are striding away down the track with the finishing tape.
This situation is not the fault of renewable energy technologies. Nuclear energy, for example, would grow much more slowly and would take even longer to catch up with growing consumption.

In one of the scenarios I explore in my study, Australia’s total final energy consumption grows linearly at the pre-pandemic rate from 2021 to 2050. Then, renewable electricity would have to grow at 7.6 times its pre-pandemic rate to catch up by 2050.
Alternatively, if renewable electricity growth is exponential, it would have to double every 6.8 years until 2050.
Considering that future growth in renewable electricity will be limited by the rate of electrifying transport and combustion heating, both the required linear and exponential growth rates appear impossible.
Both the International Energy Agency and modelling done for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change avoid the problem by assuming large-scale carbon dioxide capture and storage or directly capturing CO₂ from the air will become commercially available.
But relying on these unproven technologies is speculative and risky. Therefore, we need a Plan B: reducing our energy consumption.
My study shows if we could halve 2021 energy consumption by 2050, the transition may be possible. That is, if raw materials (such as lithium and other critical minerals) are available and local manufacturing could be greatly increased.
For example, if the total final energy consumption declines linearly and renewable electricity grows linearly, the latter would only have to grow at about three times its 2015–2019 rate to replace all fossil energy by 2050. For exponential growth, the doubling time is 9.4 years.
Improvements in energy efficiency would help, such as home insulation, efficient electrical appliances, and solar and heat pump hot water systems. However, the International Energy Agency shows such improvements will be unlikely to reduce demand sufficiently.
We need behavioural changes encouraged by socioeconomic policies, as well as technical.
To reduce our energy consumption, we would need public debate followed by policies to encourage greener technologies and industries, and to make socioeconomic changes.
This need not involve deprivation of key technologies, but rather a planned reduction to a sustainable level of prosperity.
It would be characterised by greater emphasis on improving and expanding public transport, bicycle paths, pedestrian areas, parks and national parks, public health centres, public education, and public housing.
This approach of providing universal basic services reduces the need for high incomes and its associated high consumption. As research in 2020 pointed out, the world’s wealthiest 40 million people are responsible for 14% of lifestyle-related greenhouse gas emissions.
And on a global scale, energy descent could be financed by the rich countries, including Australia. Most people would experience a better quality of life. Energy descent is a key part of the pathway to an ecologically sustainable, socially just society.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/25/nsw-releases-new-guidelines-for-large-scale-solar/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 25, 2022",NSW releases new guidelines for large-scale solar,"The New South Wales (NSW) government announced on Thursday it had published new guidelines designed to make the assessment of large-scale solar projects clearer as the state looks to shore up a reliable energy supply ahead of the impending withdrawal of coal-fired generation assets.
The NSW government wants to see at least 12 GW of renewable energy generation projects developed before 2030 to fill the gap created by the exit of coal generation but Planning Minister Anthony Roberts said it is critical solar farms are built in the right areas to best benefit communities.
“There are 83 projects that have been approved or are in the planning pipeline, with a combined capacity to power 7 million homes,” he said. “That’s on top of the 18 large-scale solar energy farms, worth more than $30 million, which are operational.
“As solar energy becomes more and more common, it’s becoming increasingly important that solar farms are well designed and in appropriate locations,” Roberts continued. “Our revised guidelines help deal with emerging concerns and issues and assist applicants and the community to better understand the planning and engagement process – from choosing a site, to decommissioning a project and rehabilitating the land.”
The guidelines have been updated to include guidance on key issues including visual impacts, community benefit and the use of agricultural land.
The new guidelines encourage project developers to consider the agricultural capability of the land during the site selection process and where possible, to “avoid siting solar energy projects on important agricultural land.”
The release of the revised guidelines follows changes to planning rules late last year aimed at protecting the character and future growth potential of regional cities from renewable projects.
With four of the state’s five coal-fired power plants expected to close in the next 15 years, starting with the 1,680MW Liddell Power Station in 2023-24, NSW Treasurer and Energy Minister Matt Kean said solar farms will play a critical role in the state’s future electricity system.
“NSW has some of the best renewable energy resources anywhere in the world,” he said. “Harnessing their power will help us deliver cleaner and cheaper electricity to households and businesses around the state, slashing energy bills and boosting industry.”
“These guidelines will provide investors with the certainty they need to mobilise private capital and deliver the energy infrastructure of the 21st century.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/25/cefc-points-to-critical-infrastructure-as-part-of-investment-strategy/,"FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 25, 2022",CEFC points to ‘critical’ infrastructure as part of investment strategy,"The Australian government-backed Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) has marked its 10-year anniversary by signalling a heightened focus on investments in transmission infrastructure as it looks to accelerate the country’s transition to renewable energy and net-zero emissions.
The Australian government’s green bank commenced operations a decade ago with access to $10 billion in capital, and a charter to catalyse private sector investment to cut emissions. Since then, the CEFC has drawn $5.43 billion from its original funding allocation, meaning it has access to a further $4.57 billion in investment capital, in addition to $3.32 billion of returns from existing investments.
The CEFC has indicated that, as well as maintaining its core focus on renewable energy investment, it will increasingly pursue investment opportunities in “critical” transmission and infrastructure projects needed to build a grid that’s fit for a clean energy future.
“Recent disruptions to our energy supply underscore the critical need to strengthen our electricity transmission network so it is fit for purpose in bringing large-scale renewable energy and energy storage to consumers,” CEFC Chief Executive Ian Learmonth said.
“The CEFC focus on this critical area of the energy transition is clearly reflected in our first and final transactions of this financial year, which were both substantial investments in grid expansion.”

In the past year, the CEFC has invested $455 million in transmission projects, including its single largest investment yet, committing up to $295 million to help develop the $2.3 billion EnergyConnect project that will link the energy grids of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria.
It also provided $160 million to connect new clean energy assets being developed in Queensland’s planned Southern Downs Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) to Australia’s main grid.
The CEFC said the investments in infrastructure are among $1.45 billion of commitments made in the 12 months to 30 June 2022. Learmonth said this includes investments across all areas of the clean energy economy, including large-scale renewables and energy storage, manufacturing, and the hydrogen sector.
“We recognise these investments are just the start of what is required,” he said. “The scale of the remaining investment task is substantial, as reflected in AEMO forecasts of a nine-fold increase in grid-scale wind and solar capacity, a three-fold lift in firming capacity and a near five-fold growth of distributed solar.”

Since inception in 2012, the CEFC has made $10.76 billion of commitments and spent $9.15 billion, catalysing $37.15 billion in ~265 different investments.
The CEFC’s investment portfolio includes 42 large-scale wind and solar projects, and Learmonth said it would look to build on its strong track record to achieve Australia’s net-zero emissions ambitions.
“While the scale of the investment requirement is seismic, so too are the opportunities,” he said. “The natural resources which powered our economy in the past century will be replaced with new resources for the next century, where we have world-leading potential in renewable energy, green hydrogen and critical minerals.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/25/queenslands-biggest-battery-reaches-full-commercial-operations/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 25, 2022",Queensland’s biggest battery reaches full commercial operations,"Singapore-based developer Vena Energy has confirmed that its 100 MW/150 MWh Wandoan South Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) project in Queensland’s Darling Downs region had commenced full commercial operations after a successful 18-month testing and commissioning phase.
Vena Energy said on Wednesday that full operational dispatch rights of the Wandoan South battery have now been formally handed over to Australia’s biggest power producer, AGL Energy, as part of a long-term power purchase agreement.
Located near Wandoan in Queensland’s south-west, the project is the largest battery yet connected to the grid in the state and one of the largest in Australia. It has a capacity of 100 MW and can store up to 150 MWh of energy – equivalent to powering approximately 57,000 average-sized Australian households annually.
Owen Sela, the head of Vena Energy Australia, said reaching operational status for the project represents a “transformative milestone” for both the company and Australia’s renewable energy future with the battery expected to play a major role in improving grid stability and support the state’s shift to renewable energy.
“We believe that energy storage is the key in addressing the intermittency of renewable energy, and the Wandoan South BESS will play a pivotal role in the acceleration of Australia’s green energy transformation and contributing to climate change mitigation,” he said.
“With the largest utility scale battery in Queensland now operational, it will encourage more renewable energy generation and help manage the supply and demand balance in the national electricity grid.”

Vena Energy, which earlier this year reached financial close for stage two of the Tailem Bend project in South Australia last year, has indicated the Wandoan South BESS is just the first phase in the larger Wandoan South Project, which will eventually feature 650 MW of solar PV and 450 MW of energy storage capacity.
Sela said full operational dispatch rights of the Wandoan South BESS have been handed over to AGL which will now dispatch the battery on a day-to-day basis under a fixed long-term contract for 15 years.
AGL Chief Operating Officer Markus Brokhof said the battery will be capable of storing clean energy during times of low demand and dispatching it at times of low production or peak demand.
“During the day when renewables are online, the Wandoan South BESS is able to store this energy and then release it when the sun isn’t shining, the wind isn’t blowing, or other forms of generation are offline,” he said.
“This is important for providing security to the energy market and avoiding system constraints, particularly in areas like the Darling Downs with a large local load and the potential for a high renewable energy build over the coming decade.”
AGL said the battery will allow it to leverage excess solar generation in Queensland and provide capacity when renewable energy projects are not generating.

For AGL, the Wandoan battery deal is part of its strategy to substantially increase its flexible storage and generation capacity to support the transition from coal generation to renewables.
The energy giant has already commenced construction on a 250 MW/1 GWh battery being developed at the site of its Torrens Island power station in South Australia and has secured planning approval for a 500 MW/2 GWh battery to be developed at the site of its coal-fired Liddell power plant in New South Wales.
AGL has also unveiled plans to build a 200 MW/800 MWh battery at Loy Yang A power station in Victoria, has received the tick of approval from NSW planning authorities for a 50MW/100MWh battery in Broken Hill, and has announced a deal with Maoneng Group to buy capacity from four 50 MW /100 MWh batteries in NSW. It is already operating the 30 MW/8MWh BESS at Dalrymple in South Australia.

The SWIS starts north in Kalbarri, extends through Perth down to Albany in the south and out to Kalgoorlie in the east. Recognised as one of the largest isolated grids in the world, the SWIS serves most of the state’s population, with more than 1.1 million customers.
Treasurer Mark McGowan said the assessment of the network will be an essential tool in the state achieving a smooth and orderly transition towards net zero by 2050.
“As the world decarbonises, it’s important we give local businesses the certainty and stability they need,” he said. “It’s important we act now to achieve an orderly transition in our electricity network to avoid the kind of situations seen elsewhere in the nation.”
An interim assessment will be undertaken ahead of the next Whole of System Plan, which is required by 2025.
Energy Minister Bill Johnston said the SWIS Demand Assessment will gather information from industry about the size, location and timeframe of anticipated electricity demand to 2030 and beyond.
“The McGowan government has already committed to the closure of state-owned coal power stations by 2030, and an investment of $3.8 billion in wind generation and storage,” he said.
“It is expected more investments will be made into renewable energy from across the whole economy in years to come.
“Western Power’s network will be the backbone that supports decarbonisation in the south-west of Western Australia, helping connect industry to renewable energy sources.”
“Industry has told us they need to decarbonise quickly and I’m pleased to explore how the network could support their ambition through the expedited SWIS Demand Assessment.”
The Treasury-led taskforce will include the Department of the Premier and Cabinet, Energy Policy WA, the Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation, and Western Power. The government said the information collected will also be used to inform the electricity Sectoral Emissions Reduction Strategies.

China’s National Energy Administration (NEA) said new solar installations hit 37.73 GW between January and the end of July, bringing total cumulative installations to 343.51 GW. The figures indicate that in July alone, the world’s largest solar market installed 6.85 GW of new solar capacity. NEA said that total investments in solar reached CNY 77.3 billion ($11.3 billion) in the first seven months of 2022, up 304% year on year.
JinkoSolar has revealed that its manufacturing operations in Sichuan province have been affected by power rationing imposed by the provincial government. The province is suffering power shortages due to ongoing high temperatures and drought, forcing some solar companies to suspend production. Last week, the provincial government urged 19 of 21 cities to suspend all industrial production for six days to save power for normal living consumption. JinkoSolar said it is unsure how long power rationing will continue, as drought is having a negative impact on hydropower generation.
China Shuifa Singyes Energy said this week that it has “temporarily squeezed” its solar engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) business in favour of its wind farms, due to rising solar project costs. Solar EPC revenue rose from CNY 60.6 million in the first half of last year to CNY 103 million in the January-June period. The state-run renewables developer posted CNY 2.97 billion of revenue in the first half.
Shunfeng International Clean Energy warned this week that it expects to record a first-half net loss of CNY 200 million, from just CNY 38.9 million during the same period a year earlier. It largely attributed this to net foreign-exchange losses of CNY 110 million.
Golden Solar has specified just how much the 54 million share options it issued in January will affect its performance. Earlier this month, the company warned that losses of CNY 3.84 million recorded in the first six months of last year would widen, largely thanks to expected amortisation costs of CNY 77.8 million associated with the share options. The solar production equipment supplier said last week that it expects first-half net losses of between CNY 100 million and CNY 110 million.
TCL Electronics said last week that its small-scale solar operation generated a gross profit of HKD 14.2 million (US$1.81 million) from first-half revenues of HKD 172 million, despite only starting up in the second quarter. Its parent company recorded net first-half profits of HKD 293 million.

Tokyo Institute of Technology researchers have optimised a dye-sensitised photocatalyst, reportedly improving water-splitting activity up to 100 times. The team, led by Assistant Professor Shunta Nishioka and Professor Kazuhiko Maeda, used ruthenium (Ru) dye-sensitised niobate nanosheets (Ru/Pt/HCa2Nb3O10) to suppress undesirable back electron transfer. The water-splitting system also consists of an oxygen evolution photocatalyst. Maeda said that the surface modification makes the nanosheet photocatalyst comparable to conventional semiconductor-based photocatalyst systems. “With the back electron transfer suppressed, the developed photocatalyst could also maintain hydrogen production at low light levels, giving it an edge over other photocatalysts that require high light intensities,” the researchers wrote in “Surface-Modified, Dye-Sensitised Niobate Nanosheets Enabling an Efficient Solar-Driven Z-Scheme for Overall Water Splitting.” Photocatalysts can absorb light and carry out water-splitting reactions simultaneously, generating an electron-hole pair for the water-splitting reaction. Researchers have previously developed a photocatalytic system, involving two semiconductor materials and an electron mediator, to prevent charge carriers from recombining. However, this development led to the undesired back electron transfer. “The electron mediator, which is typically a reversible electron acceptor/donor pairs, accepts electrons from one of the photocatalysts and donates them to the other,” the researchers wrote in Science Advances. They optimised the photocatalyst to avoid having the electron-accepting species compete with the hydrogen photocatalyst for electrons, which normally results in poor solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiencies.
South Korea has completed its largest hydrogen production complex in the city of Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi province. The US$17.5 million (AU$25 million) facility will produce up to 7 tons of hydrogen per day, or 2,450 tons a year, by pyrolysing gas via steam. It will annually supply fuel for up to 410,000 hydrogen vehicles. On average, most of the 33 hydrogen refuelling stations operating in the Seoul region have been supplied with hydrogen from more than 120 kilometres away. “As the completion of this complex stands to substantially reduce hydrogen transportation costs, the provincial government expects the hydrogen supply price in the Korean capital region to drop as well,” said the authorities.
ScotWind has cleared the process to offer seabed agreements for three new offshore wind projects. “The three projects’ initial supply chain commitments indicate an average of GBP 1.2 billion (AU$2 billion)  investment in Scotland per gigawatt of capacity built,” wrote Crown Estate Scotland. The three projects cover 560 square kilometres of the seabed and are expected to generate 2.8 GW of electricity. “The Scottish government sees offshore wind – and the hydrogen production which we hope will be enabled by offshore wind – as one of the most important economic and environmental opportunities we have,” said First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.
Vertex Hydrogen has awarded a project management services contract to Worley for its 350 MW low-carbon hydrogen production plant at Stanlow Manufacturing Complex in Ellesmere Port, England. “The 350 MW plant is the first in the UK to have completed front-end engineering and is expected to be one of the first large-scale and low-carbon hydrogen plants in the world,” wrote Worley.
Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia’s ACWA Power have signed three energy agreements worth a total of US$12 billion (AU$17b). They plan to invest in green hydrogen in the Central Asian country together with Air Products, and they also signed a $10 billion (AU$14.4b) investment cooperation agreement to jointly develop gas-to-power, renewable energy, and green hydrogen projects in Uzbekistan over five years starting in 2023, said ACWA Power.
