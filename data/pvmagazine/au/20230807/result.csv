The Energy Corporation of NSW (EnergyCo), a government-controlled authority appointed to lead the delivery of the state’s five renewable energy zones, said the proposed amendment reflects the projected size of the Central-West Orana REZ as outlined in the recently published Network Infrastructure Strategy.
Released in May 2023, the strategy proposes network infrastructure options with a total capacity of 14 GW to be delivered “as soon as practicable” over the next decade, allowing more renewable energy from solar, wind and storage projects to be distributed through the NSW transmission network.
Included in the strategy are options to increase the network capacity of the Central-West Orana REZ up to 4.5 GW in the initial first stage and up to 6 GW as part of the second stage to be delivered by 2038.
EnergyCo Chief Executive James Hay said “right sizing” the Central-West Orana REZ network capacity is critical to delivering the clean, affordable and reliable energy required to meet NSW’s net zero targets.
“This will allow the Central-West Orana REZ to cost-effectively accommodate future expansion and provide flexibility to deliver energy reliability and put downward pressure on electricity bills as we transition our economy away from a reliance on fossil fuels,” he said.

Hay said the proposed declaration amendment relates to the intended network capacity only and will not impact the geographical size of the REZ, which encompasses approximately 20,000 square kilometres centred around the town of Dubbo.
“Importantly, stage one would not change the proposed transmission infrastructure that EnergyCo has been consulting on over the past two years,” he said.
“If we need any future expansions to deliver stage two, these will be subject to separate planning and regulatory approval processes including detailed community consultation and environmental assessment under the NSW planning system.”
The Central-West Orana REZ is the first of five designated clean energy zones detailed in the NSW government’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap, which it expects will support more than $32 billion (USD 21.05 billion) of investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission in the state. REZs will also be developed in the New England, Hunter-Central Coast, South-West and Illawarra regions.
The Central-West Orana REZ is the most advanced of the zones and has sparked strong interest from prospective developers. A registrations of interest process conducted in 2020 attracted more than 100 registrations, totalling 27 GW of renewable energy capacity, valued at an estimated $38 billion.
It is expected the Central-West Orana REZ will generate up to $10 billion in private investment in the region by 2030 and support around 5,000 construction jobs at its peak.
EnergyCo is seeking feedback until 4 September 2023 on the draft declaration amendment.

The work, published in Scientific Reports, show ramp events that result in a sudden increase or decrease of outputs are likely to become longer and more frequent, in particular across the east coast and parts of northern Australia, although their magnitude will likely reduce.
The modelling indicates up to 5% changes in the future ramp frequency and periods when compared to the historical baseline. Sudden variability can lead to mismatches between electricity supply and demand, which, if unmanaged, can cause power outages or complete grid failures.
With Australia increasing its reliance on large-scale solar, the researchers said the findings underscore the importance of designers of utility scale solar plants including an appropriate storage facility to manage curtailment and energy deficit periods to maintain a supply–demand ratio.
“This work highlights the importance of considering future changes in climate when designing large-scale solar farms to ensure the incorporation of frequency control devices and storage plans for a reliable power supply,” they said.
“Further, it is of utmost importance to consider the future changes in the intermittency and ramp features due to climate change while selecting optimal locations for deploying future PV plants.”

Shukla Poddar, lead author of the study and a PhD candidate at the School of Photovoltaics and Renewable Energy Engineering, said weather-induced variability in solar power generation can lead to mismatches between electricity supply and demand, which, if unmanaged, can cause power outages or complete grid failures.
“Solar PV generation is affected by climate factors, which makes it susceptible to climate change,” she said.
“For example, changes to the way clouds pass over solar panels could cause sudden decreases (ramp-downs) or increases (ramp-ups) that can cause voltage fluctuations and blackouts.”
Merlinde Kay, co-author of the study and lecturer at the School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, said the modelling is essential for grid operators who need to understand how these ramp events will alter with climate change.
“They need to be prepared with the proper technologies and strategies to manage more regular intermittency issues,” she said, noting that managing the fluctuations caused by solar ramps is possible through mass storage technology and diversifying the renewable energy mix in the grid.
“During ramp-up events, large batteries can store excess solar to help reduce the strain on the grid,” she said. “In a ramp-down event, the stored energy can be fed back into the grid to help compensate for the loss in solar power and maintain grid stability.
“Combining this with renewable energy technologies like wind, which can operate at night, is also essential, and is already working quite well in places like South Australia at the Hornsdale Power Reserve with the Tesla battery powerpack.”
The researchers also said building solar farms in optimal locations is another strategy for mitigating against power ramps and hope the findings of their study will help inform future solar farm developments both in Australia and internationally.
“The framework we’ve developed here to study future ramp events spatiotemporally using climate modelling can be applied to different places around the world to ensure optimum grid operations in the future as the climate changes,” Poddar said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/07/investors-provide-4-7-gw-response-to-nsw-generation-and-storage-tender/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 7, 2023",Investors provide 4.7 GW response to NSW generation and storage tender,"AEMO Services, which is administering the tender process in its capacity as New South Wales (NSW) Consumer Trustee, has announced the number of bidders participating in its third tender to secure renewable projects to transform its coal-reliant energy system have significantly exceeded indicative targets for both generation and long-duration storage.
The tender was targeting 950 MW of generation and 550 MW of long-duration (at least eight hours) storage, but AEMO Services said it received offers totalling 3.1 GW of new generation capacity and 1.6 GW of long-duration storage.
AEMO Services Chair Paul Moy said the result reflects the scale of investor interest in the NSW energy transition and demonstrates the appeal of the long-term energy service agreements (LTESAs) that the state government is offering as it seeks to implement its Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap.
Successful projects will be awarded LTESAs that provide a floor price for output, which Moy said allows for greater investment certainty for developers.
“The strong support is further evidence that the long-term energy service agreements provided through our tender process addresses a key market risk that might otherwise delay or discourage investors from participating in the transition,” he said.
“Combined, the bids for generation represent a total capacity of 3.1 GW, against an indicative target of 950 MW for this tender, and bids for long-duration storage represent a total capacity of 1.6 GW, against a target of up to 550 MW.”
Moy said more than half of the projects in the current tender round were submitted in the first tender round, the results of which were announced in May.
“We designed our processes to minimise time and effort for repeat bidders, allowing participants to sharpen their pencils and return with an improved proposition,” he said.
“At the same time, it’s a positive sign that a number of new entrants have engaged with the process, demonstrating confidence in our systems and product and an evolving pipeline of projects.”
This tender round is the second for generation and long-duration storage and the third in a rolling schedule that will continue over the next 10 years. The state is also seeking offers for a minimum of 380 MW of shorter duration firming capacity (at least two hours of storage) as it rolls out its energy transition strategy.
The roadmap sets out a path to bring at least 12 GW of renewable energy generation capacity and 2 GW of long-duration storage online by 2030 to replace ageing coal-fired power stations. All of NSW’s remaining coal-fired power stations are slated to close by 2040 at the latest, with Origin’s 2,880 MW Eraring power station in the Hunter region the next to go with its close scheduled for August 2025.
AEMO Services Executive General Manager Paul Verschuer said the competing bids in this tender round will now undergo an assessment.
“If we aren’t satisfied that there are enough competing projects we can alter our plan accordingly and tender for a higher volume in future rounds,” he said. “Likewise, if we do see sufficient value we can increase the amount of energy supported.”
“In our first tender, this approach produced a line-up of successful projects willing to build the necessary energy generating infrastructure, while putting much less consumer money at risk than traditional CFD’s (contracts for difference) by contracting LTESA strike prices 40% below the levelised cost of energy.”
Successful proponents from this tender round are expected to be announced by the end of 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/07/end-of-life-pv-panels-used-as-building-material/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 7, 2023",End-of-life PV panels used as building material,"Scientists at the Indian Institute of Science have proposed using end-of-life photovoltaic (EoL-PV) panels as low-cost, low-embodied energy-building material.
The research group stressed that solar module recycling is currently not viable economically, and said its approach consists of making conventional solar panels into BIPV products without any modifications.
“There is a significant reduction in the cost due to the wall, windows and roof in case of the adoption of EoL-PV modules,” the research’s lead author, Roshan R. Rao, told pv magazine. “The weight of these panels is much lower when compared to that of conventional 250 mm thick brick walls. The foundation for an EoL-PV structure would be much lighter and cheaper.”
The researchers constructed two different real buildings integrated with EoL-PV panels: a building-applied photovoltaic (BAPV) house using brick walls with plaster and RCC Roof, with the EoL-PV modules being attached to the structure; and a building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) house where the walls, roof, and windows are constructed using EoL-PV panels.
Their performance was then compared with that of a reference house built with traditional materials. Each unit housing unit measures 3 m × 3 m × 3 m and is based on the typical construction practice followed in India.
“We conducted climate responsiveness of these buildings through measurements and whole building simulations,” Rao said. “We are assessing the climate responsiveness of such buildings in different climate zones and possible interventions to improve the thermal performance of such buildings.”
Despite the theoretical end of their lifecycle, the reused solar panels are still assumed to provide a nominal power of 4 kWh/m2/day and to be used for providing the housing units with part of the power they need. Furthermore, the Indian team considered their net embodied energy, which is the initial embodied energy subtracted by the energy they generated till the end-of-life stage.
“The cost analysis has been done considering the actual cost of each building material by developing ‘Bill of Quantities’ for a building constructed conventionally in India and the structure of the EoL-PV panel integrated buildings,” added Rao.
Through their analysis, the academics found that the BIPV building has lower net embodied energy than the BAPV unit, as the latter requires additional material to fix the EoL-PV to the existing building. “The net embodied energy of the building is only because of the non-PV building elements,” note the researchers.
Utilising Energy Payback Time (EPBT) analysis, they ascertained that payback times for the BIPV and BAPV units using 15-year-old solar modules would be 3.42 years and 5.5 years, respectively, with the annual degradation rate of the modules representing the most significant factor influencing these values. “The benefit of upcycling an EoL-PV panel from the Net Embodied Energy perspective depends on the age of the EoL-PV panel,” they noted.
The group presented its findings in the paper “Examining the use of End-of-Life (EoL) PV panels in housing and sustainability,” published in Solar Energy.
“With our approach, EoL-PV would no longer be seen as a liability to either manufacturers or users,” Rao said. “PV manufacturers may consider re-design/modify the frames with an intent to allow for such application in the end-of-life stage.”
