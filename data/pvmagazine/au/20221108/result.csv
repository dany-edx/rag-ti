This piece of accounting centres on the premise that countries which polluted more should pay more.
Sound as that logic may be – especially given the fact climate change disproportionally affects countries which have emitted less and tend to be less developed – the question of fairness isn’t one Australia appears eager to discuss. Or, evidently, pay for.

The Australian delegation in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, for the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP27, which got underway on Nov. 6, may not have a choice though, after developing nations managed to get the controversial issue of money for “loss and damage” associated with climate change put on the summit agenda.
With Australia sitting alongside the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, all of which have also contributed far less than their “fair shares” to the global climate finance target, it will be interesting to see if developing nations can find powerful players ready to lend a listening ear on the issue of climate (in)justice.

Back at home and safely within the arms of the renewable energy industry, the reluctance to grapple with issues of fairness and deep sustainability continue.
At Australia’s premier renewable energy conference, All Energy, held recently in Melbourne, panels devoted to questions of how we divvy out the benefits of the transition could be counted on one hand.
As Simon Currie, principal and cofounder of Energy Estate, pointed out, there was no visible presence from unions, and no interaction with school children or future generations.

There was also very little said about sustainability beyond decarbonisation. Given the continuing preference for the “solution” of overbuilding renewables, using chemical batteries and spruiking electric vehicles for all households, it would suggest attendees aren’t really considering pollution and embodied energy in particularly thoughtful ways.
It was glaringly obviously that the conversations are being led (and mostly covered) by an extremely narrow subset of Australians: entrepreneurs or aspiring entrepreneurs. In other words, largely middle-aged white men devoted to free market economics.
The habitual and wildly unoriginal response “leave it to the market, the market always knows best” – as if the free market were a new and “disruptive” philosophical concept rather than the exact model which brought us to where we are today – hardly imbues one with a great confidence that Australia’s climate response is on a just and equitable path.
So far, it doesn’t seem like too much has happened in the first few days of the summit other than Andrew Forrest getting a lot of airtime, and Australia signing up to the “Green Shipping Challenge” to decarbonise global shipping at US President Joe Biden’s behest.
These are the world leaders gathered for #COP27. The fact that less than 10 of them are women is simply beyond words.

The Green Climate Fund, which former Prime Minister Scott Morrison quit in 2019, is part of the compact between poor and rich countries, the basis for the Paris climate agreement, and seeks to support the efforts of developing countries in responding to the challenge of climate change.
Australia’s summit delegation – led by energy minister Chris Bowen, and notably excluding Prime Minister Anthony Albanese – is also trying to drum up support to host the 2026 conference alongside Pacific nations. Our country’s poor climate record with the Pacific probably doesn’t win us much faith with our neighbours, though.
#COP27 must deliver massive emissions reductions, money for loss & damage with social justice
As #ClimateChange negotiations have failed over the last 30 years. 🤦‍♂️

Australia is reportedly also battling Germany for the privilege – a country more developed in its discussions of climate equity – and with a much better climate financing history, having allocated above its “fair share,” according to the Carbon Brief.
Even from a distance, it’s hard not to taste COP27’s soured flavour. After a year that has seen fossil fuel profits ascend to the heavens and fear around energy security surge, the tone is far from upbeat. Climate activist and youth ambassador Greta Thunberg has refused to attend COP27, labelling the summit an exercise in “greenwashing, lying and cheating.”
Indeed, the event is sponsored by Coca-Cola, which uses fossil fuels to produce about 120 billion disposable bottles each year. And despite being dubbed the African COP, youth activists have reportedly struggled to get passes to the event – only reaffirming the image that conference-goers want to continue shirking the topic of fairness.
Whether Australia and other developed nations will properly consider how the question of fairness sits in systems they currently benefits from, only time will tell.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/08/could-australia-still-have-a-pathway-to-manufacturing-green-steel/,"FINANCE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 8, 2022",Could Australia still have a pathway to manufacturing green steel?,"While green steel is one of the most obvious use cases for the hydrogen Australia seems intent on producing, the question of setting up manufacturing capability here has been spluttering at best.
For BayWa r.e. Australia technology innovation and hydrogen lead, James Hamilton, this is a massive oversight with Europe rapidly capturing the market.
In what may prove a step in the right direction, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), announced $947,035 in funding to Calix Limited to evaluate the feasibility of a low emissions method for reducing iron. 
The funding accounts for roughly 48% of the total $1.96 million need to complete the Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) study which will scope the design for a renewably powered 30,000 tonne per annum demonstration plant using a low emissions method for reducing iron – colourfully named ZESTY, Zero Emissions Steel Technology.

The funding beneficiary, Calix, is a difficult company to define. Established in 2005, Calix has a global presence, and says its team develops “environmentally friendly solutions for many emissions intensive industries, including agriculture, cement manufacture, and mining and mineral processing.”
ZESTY appears to be one such solution, with the company saying the proposed “ZESTY-iron plant” will produce green hydrogen for the direct reduction of iron ore to sponge iron. “With no carbon involved throughout the process, the proposed ZESTY reactor will demonstrate a new approach to zero emissions iron and steel,” Calix adds.
“Calix’s ZESTY steel process involves the use of the ZESTY iron process feeding a standard (continuous) electric arc furnace (C-EAF), with the addition of a Leilac kiln to produce zero-emissions lime,” the company says.
“ZESTY can be electrically heated and is compatible with intermittent sources of renewable generation and grid load balancing applications,” Calix says. “The unique, indirect heating approach not only enables efficient electrification, but also removes sources of combustion and the generation of hydrogen-oxygen flames, allowing a simpler design and processing at significantly lower temperatures than a conventional BF [blast furnaces].”
As opposed to other direct reduced iron (DRI) technologies, Calix says its indirect heating of the reduction reaction with renewable energy means the hydrogen is not consumed as a fuel but as a reductant, allowing for easier recycling.
“As such, ZESTY is targeting the minimum hydrogen use of 54kg of hydrogen per tonne of iron, enabling more efficient and economical production of green iron and steel. ZESTY’s ability to handle small particle sizes has the potential to more easily remove impurities compared with other (DRI) processes, which require pelletised and typically higher grade iron ores.”
The aim of the technology is to enable steel producers to add green iron directly into their processes.
The $1.96 million study will determine the final location, specification and cost of the demonstration plant before a final investment decision is taken. The study is due to be completed in late 2023.
Manufacturing green iron and steel is touted by Calix as a “unique Australian opportunity,” noting Australia supplied over 53% of the world’s iron ore in 2021, and that iron and steel are the second largest source of industrial emissions after cement – responsible for 7% of global CO2 emissions.
It is a position one of Australia’s most prominent economists and renewable energy commentators, Professor Ross Garnaut, holds great sympathy for. In his recent book, the Superpower Transformation, Garnaut argues zero-carbon steel exports to China hold the most promise for Australia’s vision of becoming a renewable superpower.
As Calix points out, haematite makes up 96% of Australia’s exported iron ore and is not suited to most electric arc furnace methods – though its ZESTY technology can use it.
“ZESTY-iron is being developed to enable Australian producers to transition towards exporting higher value green hot briquetted iron (HBI) instead of iron ore. The use of HBI to make steel in both Basic Oxygen Furnaces and [Electric arc furnaces] is proven, and zero emissions HBI would significantly reduce the emissions footprint of both processes, as the energy demand to reduce iron ore accounts for the vast majority of energy consumption in steelmaking,” the company says.
“With current iron prices around three to four times the value of iron ore, the processing of iron ore to metallic iron, and particularly green iron, represents a significant opportunity for Australia to secure and enhance its share of global iron exports, and capture more value from its most exported resource.”
Calix Managing Director and CEO, Phil Hodgson, said “this project aims to further develop a homegrown Australian technology that we believe, together with Australia’s leading iron ore and renewable energy resources, can help make Australia a leading exporter of not just iron ore, but green iron and green steel.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/08/to-play-climate-catch-up-australia-must-learn-to-battle-supply-chain-woes/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"NOVEMBER 8, 2022","To play climate catch-up, Australia must learn to battle supply chain woes","Over the last few months, the federal and state governments have made several ambitious announcements and targets around renewable energy.
In June, Prime minister Anthony Albanese formally committed Australia to cut emissions by 43% by the end of the decade. Along with this comes the commitment to lift the share of low-cost renewables in the National Electricity Market to 82% by 2030. This commitment joins those of the state and territory governments.
The policy will include up to $3 billion to invest in renewable metals, renewable energy component manufacturing and renewable hydrogen electrolysers, and a commitment to 85 solar banks and 400 community batteries across Australia.
This is undeniably fantastic news. From a federal government policy perspective Australia has quickly gone from a climate outlier on the world stage to an active participant in our global race to save the planet.
However, it would be naive to ignore the fact that this rapid growth will present challenges for the industry, where demand may outstrip supply in many key areas of the renewable energy value chain.
The Covid pandemic and global demand changes driven by electric vehicle (EV) uptake, decarbonisation targets and the energy transition have resulted in a trifecta of challenges for the Australian renewable industry, supply chain issues, elevated prices and global chip shortages. 
If we want to be in with a chance of meeting Australia’s ambitious federal, state and corporate energy targets, we, as an industry, must work together to tackle these challenges head on.
The recent Rystad Energy report outlines how high prices and long lead times are “threaten[ing] solar PV capacity build-out”, and that the forecasts of 225 GW (AC) of PV to start construction in 2023 could potentially be downgraded.
The report also highlights how lead times for new inverters are currently being quoted anywhere between six to 15 months, highlighting the severity of the current blockages in the supply chain.
A lot of engineering, procurement, and construction (EPCs) and developers in the Australian market have already been impacted by long equipment delays or even cancellations. The delays have a knock-on effect, where the delay in the completion of projects leads to a delay in signing new projects.
Security of supply and lead time certainty is paramount, especially given inverter selection is made at such an early stage in Australia. The risk of a delay to commercial operation due to supplier delays is massive.
Alongside supply chain delays, the global chip shortage is also causing suppliers to face critical shortages of electronic components. Beginning in 2020, the global chip shortage began with supply reducing thanks to Covid-19 lockdowns, plummeting vehicle sales, and severe weather events.
When demand began to bounce back faster than expected, supply simply couldn’t cope. As noted in Rystad’s report, working from home increased demand for consumer electronics, which is ~50% of global chip production, while car sales rebounded faster than expected from pandemic lows, equating to ~15% of global chip demand.
Such challenges are one of the key reasons SMA announced plans to double its production capacity at its German headquarters. With a current capacity of 21 GW, the German manufacturer expects to take that capacity to 40 GW by 2024. The expansion is to start construction later this year and will primarily be dedicated to the manufacture of inverters for the large-scale PV industry.
The year ahead looks to be an unparalleled year of growth for renewable energy in Australia. In order for solar and storage projects to achieve their targeted start dates and meet our more ambitious targets, strong and reliable partners are critical for success.

The US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) have published a protocol for standardised PEC water-splitting efficiency measurements, similar to the certification system in place to for PV cell efficiency. “It’s really difficult to compare reported PEC water-splitting efficiency results between labs, because people tend to make measurements under different conditions,” said Todd Deutsch, a senior scientist at NREL and co-author of “Best practices in PEC: How to reliably measure solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of photocathodes.” The paper, published in Frontiers in Energy Research, proposes uniform experimental practices, starting with materials for the fabrication of photoelectrodes. The researchers have also proposed a fabrication procedure, an experimental setup, and a process to measure solar-to-hydrogen efficiency.
University of Malaya researchers and University of the Punjab scientists have jointly investigated the feasibility of hydrogen as a primary combustion fuel for municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration, by designing a vertical shaft-type incinerator that can operate on pure hydrogen. “The hydrogen-based incinerator exhibited the highest performance for homogenous paper and food waste (1 kg) with 60% and 87% moisture content, respectively,” the team wrote in “Hydrogen as potential fuel for solid waste incineration for a sustainable waste management,” which was recently published in Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Access. They fed a pre-mixed hydrogen and oxygen fuel through burners to achieve homogenous heat distribution, with tests on different MSWs, and moisture percentages from 60% and 90%. The maximum recorded temperature of the incineration was 850 C. They said an increase in moisture content of the waste could reduce the performance of the hydrogen-based incineration system.
The European Commission has launched its third call for large-scale projects under the EU Innovation Fund with a budget of €3 billion ($4.6 billion), thanks to increased revenue from auctioning EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) allowances. It has allocated €1 million for general decarbonisation processes and €2 billion for innovative electrification in industry and hydrogen. It has also set aside €700 million for innovative projects in the production of components, including final equipment for electrolyzers and fuel cells, renewables, energy storage, and heat pumps. The call is open for projects in EU member states, Iceland, and Norway until March 16, 2023. Hydrogen Europe said it welcomes the introduction of a dedicated facility targeting the deployment of new electrolyzer and fuel cell factories. 
Delgaz Grid, the natural gas and electricity distribution unit of E.ON Romania, is starting a pilot project in November to test the compatibility of user installations and distribution system components, with a mixture of natural gas and hydrogen. “The project will run from November 2022 to October 2024 and aims to analyse and demonstrate that it is technically feasible and safe to add hydrogen, at 20% by volume, to existing natural gas distribution networks and utilisation facilities in Romania,” said the company.
Cummins will start producing electrolysers in the United States and expand PEM electrolyzer production capacity at its factory in Oevel, Belgium, to 1 GW. The company said in its third-quarter results that it will make electrolysers in Fridley, Minnesota, starting at 500 MW of annual manufacturing capacity, but scalable to 1 GW “in the future.”
Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) and Enel Green Power have announced plans to jointly explore the co-development of the green hydrogen value chain, with an initial focus on Latin America and Australia. The companies said they aim to make green hydrogen cost-competitive with fossil fuel-based alternatives within this decade.
Centrica and Equinor have signed a cooperation agreement to explore the development of a “low-carbon” hydrogen production hub in Easington, England. “Currently, up to one-third of the UK’s total gas supply enters via Easington, much of it from Equinor’s Norwegian facilities,” said Centrica, adding that the area is close to some of the world’s largest offshore wind farm developments.

IRENA expects Indonesia’s power sector to experience a “radical transformation” by 2050, according to its recently published “Indonesia Energy Transition Outlook” report. The share of renewables in the country’s electricity generation mix could hit 85% by 2050, from around 12% in 2011, said IRENA.
Solar is expected to become the backbone of this transformation, accounting for 798 GW of the total 1 TW under the “least ambitious” scenario. PV accounts for up to 840 GW under the “most ambitious” scenario. For that, Indonesia will need to add 66 GW of new solar capacity to its generation mix by 2030.
To achieve this goal, the nation would need to invest USD 44 billion ($66 billion) in solar. Investment in other renewable technologies would amount to USD 39 billion, with an additional investment of USD 75 billion on grid infrastructure also being required. Battery storage would need a USD 5.5 billion investment and EV charging infrastructure would need USD 22 billion.
Indonesia’s own expectations are still far off from IRENA’s scenarios, however. The country’s 2021-30 electricity plan, released last year, set a renewables target of 23% by 2030, under its “optimum” scenario.  The country currently has around 190 MW of installed solar capacity, according to Apricum.
In May, Saudi Arabian developer ACWA Power won a bid to develop 110 MW of floating solar in water reservoirs, 50 MW on the island of Sumatra, and 60 MW on Java.
In April, Singapore-based Quantum Power Asia and Germany’s ib vogt announced plans to invest USD 5 billion in a 3.5 GW solar and 12 GW storage project.
In January alone, Indonesia installed 51.2 MW of rooftop solar PV capacity, including C&I and residential projects, according to data from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources.
