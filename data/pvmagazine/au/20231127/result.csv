The $29 million facility is a collaboration between Graphite Energy and Cygnus Ag, which appears to be a local Lake Cargelligo agriculture company, and includes other stakeholders from industry, research and government.

Graphite Energy doesn’t appear to have been on the scene for very long, but according to the company it has developed a proprietary thermal energy storage system for the decarbonisation of industrial and manufacturing operations. It is not clear yet how exactly this technology will work within the facility, but presumably it will store solar energy. 
Of the facility, to date Graphite Energy has noted the masterplan includes 5 MW of solar to be combined with “multiple forms of integrated energy storage,” including batteries, thermal energy storage for heating, cooling and drying, and hydrogen for diesel substitution.
The project aims to be a replicable pilot for Australia and abroad to demonstrate how renewable energy and agriculture can coexist, “using industry advancements to enable renewable energy sources without forgoing farmland,” Graphite Energy says.

The deal will see the nbn take around 20% of the expected output of Mytilineos’ Munna Creek solar farm, which is set to go into operations in July 2025.
The 10-year PPA is the nbn’s third such renewable energy offtake deal, with the other two pertaining to Mytilineos’ 75 MW West Wyalong solar farm in the New South Wales Riverina and AGL’s 420 MW Macarthur Wind Farm in south west Victoria, both announced earlier this year.
Once complete, Munna Creek solar farm will include approximately 255,000 solar panels and sit over a 467 hectare site.

The extraordinary uptick in renewable energy demand triggered by the beginning of the war in Ukraine, with the subsequent huge increase in the renewables industry’s global manufacturing capacity may have represented a unique phase in the history of clean energies, as well as in the political discourse surrounding energy matters.
This is the conclusion of a recent study conducted by a group of researchers from the University of Freiburg and the University of Münster in Germany, in which its authors analysed the repercussions of the war on the public debate in their home country.
“This was a particular historic moment, and I do not see a reason why this dynamic should continue or become a regular cycle,” the research’s corresponding author, Thilo Wiertz, told pv magazine. “What seems clear to me is that Germany will not get back to the time of cheap natural gas. Germany is building large capacities for importing liquid natural gas (LNG) and this helps keep prices reasonably stable.”
Wiertz acknowledged that more global crises may occur in the future, but he also sees little reason to assume a regular pattern. He believes LNG will remain more expensive than past pipeline imports from Russia and will be in conflict with political commitments to reduce emissions. “At the same time, costs for producing renewable energy will remain low, particularly internationally,” he said.
According to Wiertz, the crisis experience has raised political and public awareness of the vulnerabilities resulting from dependence on fossil fuel imports. Those vulnerabilities are not new, but have largely been absent from the German energy discourse in the last decades.
“Before the war against Ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis, renewable energy was perceived by many as expensive and unreliable,” he stated. “Fossil fuels, in contrast, were perceived as environmentally problematic, but economically more robust. This picture is slowly being turned upside down: Renewable energy is now presented as a way to diversify imports, decrease dependence, and strengthen energy sovereignty.”
This view is also being supported by falling production costs for renewable energy, particularly PV, and visions for a swift ramp-up of a global hydrogen economy. “We may be entering a time where renewable energy is seen not only as environmentally friendly, but as economically and politically more reliable,” Wiertz added. “Fossil fuels, on the other hand, are increasingly considered a geopolitical risk and burden of the past. And rightly so.”
In the paper “A Turn to Geopolitics: Shifts in the German Energy Transition Discourse in Light of Russia’s War Against Ukraine,” published in Energy Research & Social Science, Wiertz and his group analysed newspaper articles, tweets, talk shows, and parliamentary speeches published immediately after the breakout of Ukraine‘s war and found the political discourse marked a geopolitical turn in Germany’s energy transition, the so-called Energiewende.
The researchers identified, in particular, four discursive shifts in the political discussion in Germany. The first one relates to the question of whether gas imports from Russia stall or favor the transition, while the second one is about a “new moral imperative” for lowering dependence on fossil fuels. The third shift is regarding the possibility of using conventional energy sources as bridging technologies, and the fourth one frames the discussion on the energy transition in terms of security, freedom, and sovereignty.
“The discursive shifts that we identified are crucial for understanding the political future of the Energiewende and German energy politics more broadly,” the researchers explained. “At the time of writing, the war continues into its second year. It is reasonable to assume that the new geopolitical rationality and the identified lines of argument will shape the energy transition in Germany in the foreseeable future—and reshuffle established ideological positions.”
The researchers expect all political parties to reconsider their position toward the Enegiewende, stressing that discourses may change rapidly if circumstances change. “While discourse analysis often focuses on how certain perspectives become hegemonic over time, in the context of crises it can help to identify shifts at an early stage,” they also asserted.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/27/solar-module-prices-may-reach-0-10-w-by-end-2024/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 27, 2023",Solar module prices may reach USD 0.10/W by end 2024,"From pv magazine Global
Solar module prices may approach the threshold of USD 0.10/W by the end of 2024 or eventually in 2025, according to Tim Buckley, director of Australia-based think tank Climate Energy Finance (CEF).
“This would be nicely ahead of Dr. Martin Green’s USD 0.10/W by 2030 forecast made three years back,” he told pv magazine, adding that he came to this conclusion after estimating that new annual PV additions may reach between 600 GW and 1 TW already by the end of this decade. “I am very bullish on the rate of global growth in solar installs over the next few years. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has reminded everyone of the need for supply chain and energy security, particularly in terms of imported energy reliance.”
Buckley also noted the likely new climate accord by Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden, might see a formal call for a tripling of renewables capacity globally by 2030.
“At a time of massive capital investment cost blowouts, to be able to invest in deflationary solar is a massive global boon that will provide cost of living pressure relief as well as improved energy security,” he said.
Overcapacity issues
Buckley said price pressure will increase due to the staggering capacity increases announced by the PV industry at the global level, although he questioned a recent forecast by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its recent World Energy Outlook 2023, which claimed that the world’s cumulative installed solar capacity could reach 2 TW by 2025.
“I find the IEA assumption that the Chinese will run their brand new factories just 35% of the time as ludicrous,” he added. “As this new capacity is brought online for a full year, I would expect the IEA figures to be undercooked by over 50% in terms of global annual solar installs.”
Buckley estimates that solar module prices will end up dropping by 40% this year.
“This will give many investors in the US, India, EU and China good reasons to pause or rethink their financial assumptions that underpinned their announcements of massive capacity expansions,” he said. “Against this, both the US and India have 40% solar module import duties against Chinese products, so they are largely insulated from excessive price competition, and share the cost savings of the 70% decline in polysilicon price over the last year as well.”
Rapid deflation and excessive price pressures, on the other hand, may soon lead to the closure of old technology, sub-scale solar manufacturing facilities, both in China and globally.
“Old facilities simply can’t compete with the scale advantages nor the new technology investments of the world leading firms in this sector, almost all of which are Chinese,” said Buckley.
New cycle
Describing this new industry cycle for the solar PV technology, Buckley said it is different from previous ones, as solar is now the cheapest electricity, which is disrupting incumbent industry competitors.” This means finance will rapidly flee from investing in any new thermal power capacity in the electricity sector globally,” he said.
The analyst is convinced that finance won’t just flee for environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues or moralistic or climate reasons, but it will flee nonetheless because it will not provide new financing to inevitably stranded assets, particularly with the concurrent rapid scaling up of battery energy storage and EVs.
“This time is different because of the convergence of power-industry-transport markets,” Buckley said.
Tim Buckley is the main author of “Solar pivot: A massive global solar boom is disrupting energy markets and speeding the transition,” which was published by CEF in June. There, Buckley and his colleagues said they estimated solar electricity costs to drop 10% annually for the rest of this decade, halving by 2030. The report also provides detailed information on the operating and planned capacity of the global PV supply chain.
