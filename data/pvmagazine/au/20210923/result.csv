With the Australian energy market moving away from coal, emerging technologies such as battery storage are increasingly needed to facilitate the transition to renewable energy generation by allowing electricity to be despatched to the grid as needed.
DPIE acting executive director of Energy, Resources and Industry Assessments, Chris Ritchie, said the Broken Hill BESS would capture, store and distribute energy from surrounding wind and solar PV farms, including the 53 MW Broken Hill Solar Farm, shoring up energy supply for the mining town and beyond.
“Batteries will be key players in our transition to a renewable future, releasing extra energy when we need it and storing electricity when we don’t, making sure the grid is secure,” Ritchie said in a statement.
“As we bring more wind and solar projects into the grid, it’s cutting-edge energy storage projects like the Broken Hill Battery that will help maintain reliability and keep the lights on across the state.
“There have been major advances in battery technology, and we will continue to see more large-scale batteries operating alongside solar and wind farms with many in the planning pipeline.”
The Broken Hill BESS is to be built on industrial land about 6 kilometres southeast of the city centre. It will connect to TransGrid’s Broken Hill substation via a 22 kV overhead powerline.

AGL said the battery project has been designed to be compatible with the Broken Hill Solar Farm and the nearby 200 MW Silverton Wind Farm, both of which it operates.
Construction is expected to begin later this year, with commissioning planned for 2023.
AGL chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said a final investment decision on the Broken Hill BESS is subject to the finalisation of contracts and approvals.
“With the green light on planning, we can now proceed to investment decision, another important step to become the leading orchestrator of batteries,” he said.

The Broken Hill project is part of AGL’s plan to add at least 850 MW of new large-scale battery storage to its portfolio by 2024.
The energy giant has also announced plans to build utility-scale batteries at the site of its Torrens Island power station (250 MW) in South Australia, at Loy Yang A power station in Victoria (200MW) and Liddell power station (150MW) in NSW. Other battery projects include Wandoan (100 MW) in Queensland, Maoneng (4 x 50 MW) in NSW, and Dalrymple (30 MW) in South Australia.
Brokhof said with the progressive increase in installed renewable generators within the NEM, there is a requirement to provide energy storage to add flexibility to Australia’s energy supply and help maintain network stability and security.
“The limiting factor for renewable technology has always been storage but we are taking control of these constraints by turning our attention to firming technology, like batteries,” Brokhof said.
“Batteries and energy storage are critical to supporting the increased growth of renewable generation and in turn driving downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices.
“AGL’s grid-scale battery projects are ensuring we have energy storage and firming capacity at the ready to enable a seamless transition from thermal generation to renewables.”

Work on the battery facility is scheduled to commence later this year, with construction of the entire project expected to be complete by late 2022.
The new solar plant and battery storage system will complement the existing 1.7 MW solar farm and connect directly to the Weipa electricity network, helping provide reliable power for Rio Tinto’s Weipa bauxite mine and processing facilities as well as the surrounding community.
When complete, the combined 4MW solar capacity and 4MW/4MWh battery will provide about 11 GWh of renewable energy annually. The solar+storage plant will be backed up by diesel-fired generators.
It is expected the upgrades will reduce diesel consumption at Rio Tinto’s Weipa operations by an estimated 7 million litres per year and lower its annual carbon dioxide emissions by about 20,000 tonnes.
Rio Tinto Aluminium Pacific Bauxite Operations general manager Michelle Elvy said the battery storage will help stabilise the existing Weipa power generation network, while the thermal generation will be used to fill the gaps in the evening or when there is low sunlight.
“The new solar farm and battery storage at Weipa will help us lower our carbon footprint and diesel use in a reliable way,” she said.
“The original Weipa solar farm was the largest solar facility at an off-grid Australian mine site at the time it was built, and it played an important role in showing the viability of renewable energy systems in remote locations.
“The new solar farm and battery storage system is part of Rio Tinto’s group-wide commitment to reduce emissions across our operations. There is clearly more work to be done, but projects like this are an important part of meeting our climate targets.”

The existing 1.6 MW solar farm was completed in 2015 and purchased by EDL in 2018.
EDL chief executive officer James Harman said since then the Queensland-based developer had delivered a string of “high-penetration, award-winning hybrid renewable microgrids in other remote locations around Australia”.
“We’ll be leveraging expertise from these projects to increase our supply of clean energy for Rio Tinto’s operations and the local community, with no compromise on power quality or reliability,” Harman said.
The Weipa project forms part of Rio Tinto’s commitment to reduce its carbon footprint, targeting net zero emissions by 2050.
The miner earlier this year appointed Perth-based civil contractor NRW Holdings to deliver a 34 MW solar + battery energy storage system at its Gudai-Darri mine in Western Australia’s Pilbara region.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/23/australian-regulator-takes-tesla-big-battery-to-court/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2021",Australian regulator takes Tesla big battery to court,"The Australian Energy Regulator (AER) has instituted proceedings in the federal court against Neoen’s 150 MW/194 MWh Hornsdale Big Battery (HPR) – widely known as the Tesla big battery – for alleged breaches of the National Electricity Rules, saying the South Australian facility did not provide the frequency control services it was paid for.
“Between July and November 2019, HPR made offers to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and was paid to provide market ancillary services which allegedly it could not in fact provide, including when required to provide those services after a frequency disturbance,” the AER said in a statement.
“The services are known as contingency frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) and they are required to keep the lights on following a power system disturbance.”
The AER said the AEMO first brought the matter to its attention in October 2019 when the Kogan Creek coal station in Queensland tripped.
The regulator alleges that HPR’s failure to be capable of providing the FCAS in accordance with its offers and AEMO’s dispatch instructions “created a risk to power system security and stability”.
“It is vital that generators do what they say they can do if we’re going to keep the lights on through the market’s transition to variable renewable generation,” AER chair Clare Savage said.
“AEMO relies on accurate information and compliance with offers and dispatch instructions to ensure it can effectively stabilise frequency deviations.
“Contingency FCAS providers receive payment from AEMO to be on standby to provide the services they offer.
“We expect providers to be in a position, and remain in a position, to respond when called upon by AEMO.”
The AER is seeking pecuniary penalties, declarations and costs.
Neoen Australia managing director Louis de Sambucy opted not to comment on the specific allegations but in a brief statement said HPR had repeatedly delivered on high expectations since opening for business in 2017, in terms of “its performance and market impact, positively impacting ancillary service prices and proving itself to be a critical component of the South Australian electricity network”.
“Whilst we are disappointed by the AER decision, we will continue to maintain our collaborative relationship with them,” he said.

The court action comes as Neoen faces potential delays with what will be its biggest battery in Australia, the 300 MW/450 MWh project Victoria Big Battery, following a fire in one of its Tesla Megapacks.
The Victoria Big Battery, being developed near the Moorabool Terminal Station at Geelong, was due for completion in November.
The new Victorian battery is just the latest for Neoen which has in recent months secured tenders for the first stage of the Goyder South project in South Australia and a big battery in Canberra. The French firm also built the soon-to-be commissioned 20 MW/ 34 MWh Bulgana green power hub in north west Victoria.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/23/dutch-gas-giant-begins-storing-hydrogen-in-underground-salt-cavern/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2021",Dutch gas giant begins storing hydrogen in underground salt cavern,"From pv magazine Global
Dutch natural gas infrastructure and transportation company Gasunie has begun storing hydrogen at its underground storage facility at Zuidwending, near Veendam in the Netherlands’ northeastern province of Groningen.
“Underground hydrogen storage in salt caverns is a safe, efficient and reliable way to store large quantities of energy, also for a longer period of time,” the company said in a statement. “The Zuidwending site in the province of Groningen offers unique conditions for preparing large-scale hydrogen storage for the envisaged development of the hydrogen market.”
The Dutch gas provider explained that it is injecting hydrogen into the cavern over a six-week period and that further tests will be run from November to spring 2022. “The pressure was gradually increased to more than 200 bar,” it specified. “Materials and components required for gas storage were also assessed for their suitability for hydrogen storage.”
If the testing phase is successful, the company plans to make the cavern fully operational by 2026. An investment decision is expected to be made next year. Eventually, Gasunie will build four caverns by 2030, which would bring the site’s total capacity to up to 4 GW. “However, Gasunie will have to make pre-investments,” it added. “Among other things, the necessary infrastructure must be ready for an end situation with four salt caverns.” Gasunie added that, in order to use a cavern for storage, large volumes of hydrogen are needed as “cushion gas” to allow the technology to work properly. “In both cases, these are costs that cannot be recovered immediately,” it added.
Gasunie is also part of a Dutch consortium that aims to create a hydrogen exchange market in the Netherlands.
A recent study by the Jülich Institute for Energy and Climate Research (IEK-3) stated that salt caverns offer a flexible, efficient option for hydrogen storage. The research group estimated that Europe has the technical potential to store 84.8 PWh of hydrogen in bedded salt deposits and salt domes.
Most of the continent’s salt caverns, on and offshore, are in Northern Europe. Germany accounts for the largest share, followed by the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark and Poland. There are other sites in Romania, France, Spain and Portugal.
The IEK-3 researchers said the proximity of the caverns to the coast is helpful, as brine disposal remains economical up to 50 km from the sea. The caverns in the Carresse-Cassaber area of southwestern France, planned for the HyGéo project, are around 48 km from the coast.
