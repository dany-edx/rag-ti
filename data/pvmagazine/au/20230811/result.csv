It is expected the facility will generate approximately 4.2 GWh of clean energy annually, or up to 25% of Diavik’s power needs.
Diavik Diamond Mine President and Chief Operating Officer Angela Bigg said the solar plant will significantly expand the operation’s existing renewable energy generation, which already features a wind-diesel hybrid power facility that has a capacity of 55.4 MW.
“We will be significantly increasing our renewable power generation with the largest solar power plant in Canada’s northern territories,” she said.
“The combination of solar and wind power will work well together as solar is more predictable than wind, but wind can generate power at all times of the day. Having both will provide more consistent renewable generation.”
Rio, which is targeting net zero emissions across its global operations by 2050, expects the solar plant will reduce diesel consumption at the Diavik site by approximately one million litres per year and reduce carbon emissions by 2,900 tonnes.
Construction of the solar plant is expected to start in the coming weeks with the facility scheduled to be fully operational in the first half of 2024.
The project is supported by more than $4.1 million (CAN 3.6 million) in funding from the Canadian government which this week announced draft clean electricity regulations designed to help the nation achieve a net-zero electricity grid by 2035.
In a statement, the Canadian government said setting new rules for cleaner power will “stimulate investments in renewable energy like wind and solar, smart grid and energy storage systems.”
“Our electricity grid is already one of the cleanest in the world, with more than 84% of electricity generated from non-emitting sources like hydro, nuclear, and wind,” it said. “The draft regulations will ensure we decarbonise the remainder of our grid, while meeting the needs of increasing demand for electricity.”
Canada has announced more than $45 billion in new tax credits and other major federal investments to help drive economic opportunities through the construction of new power sources and retrofitting of existing plants.

Both projects are to be constructed on land owned by Altech in Germany.
The funds were raised through a $3 million placement as well as an entitlement offer partially underwritten by major German shareholders Deutsche Balaton and Delphi.
Martin Stein, chief financial officer of the Perth-based Altech Batteries, said he is extremely pleased with the support as the company looks to maximise the opportunities linked with the surge in demand for battery energy storage solutions.
“This sends a strong message of support for both the Cerenergy and Silumina Anodes battery projects,” he said. “Funds received will be applied to both of these projects.”
The first of those projects is Altech’s joint venture collaboration with German research organisation Fraunhofer IKTS which seeks to commercialise a facility that will produce 10,000 individual 10 kWh Cerenegy battery modules each year to provide solutions for the stationary storage market and the long-duration energy sector.
Altech claims its Cerenergy technology, which relies on sodium ions commonly found in table salt and avoids using rare and expensive metals such as lithium, cobalt, graphite and copper, can reduce costs by up to 40% compared to lithium-ion batteries which dominate the global energy storage market.
Altech is also aiming to secure a share of the short-period energy storage market with its silumina anodes product which incorporates high-purity alumina (HPA) coated silicon and graphite into the anode of lithium-ion batteries.
The company is progressing plans to develop a facility in Germany which would produce anode materials to supply Europe’s surging lithium-ion battery and EV markets.
The plant would combine Altech’s HPA and proprietary coating technology with regular battery-grade graphite to produce an anode material that it said has about 30% higher retention capacity than traditional graphite-only anodes.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/11/electric-train-steers-south-australia-toward-net-zero-milestone/,"EV,HYDROGEN,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 11, 2023",Electric train steers South Australia toward net zero milestone,"The South Australian government has announced that the 42-kilometre-long Gawler rail line is set to run with all-electric trains from next week as another new train enters service.
The train is the tenth of 12 new three-car electric trains that the state government has purchased at a cost of $175 million. The remaining two trains are expected to be added to the Adelaide Metro fleet by the end of 2023.
SA Transport Minister Tom Koutsantonis said the testing and commissioning of this latest three-car train set has now been completed, meaning the train can go into service in coming days, providing capacity to run full electric services on the Gawler line.
“We’re flicking the switch on a new era for the Gawler line, with sufficient capacity for passengers to enjoy electric trains on every service,” he said.
“The tenth new electric train will enter service next week, with a further two electric trains to be running on the Gawler line by the end of the year.”
Once the remaining two electric multiple unit (EMU) trains enter service, Adelaide Metro will have a fleet of 34 EMU trains to maintain fully electric services on the Gawler, Seaford and Flinders lines. The first of the EMU trains was introduced into service in April 2022.
The electrification of the Gawler line was first announced in 2008 as a joint-funded project between the then state and federal governments but was soon after shelved for almost a decade after funding was pulled by subsequent governments.
It was reinstated in 2018 but since then, the project has been dogged by delayed opening dates but the state government is now confident the electrification project is now on track.
“The addition of the tenth train to the Gawler line gives us the capacity to run a fully-electric service on the line,” it said. “On occasions, it may still be necessary to run on a diesel train on the line due to maintenance and fleet improvements across the network. However, each additional EMU builds greater capacity to continue all-electric services during these periods.”
The state government said the electrification project is a step towards transitioning to an efficient, zero-emissions public transport system to support its net zero emissions by 2050 target.

In addition to the rail line electrification project, the state is also exploring the use of hydrogen to help decarbonise the transport industry.
Two hydrogen buses and hybrid-diesel railcars are set to be deployed on routes in Adelaide later this month.
The first of the hydrogen buses arrived in Adelaide earlier this month with operator Torrens Transit to begin internal testing in collaboration with Foton Mobility, BOC and H2H Energy on the two Foton hydrogen fuel cell buses before they are released for operation. The trial HFCBs will be powered by green hydrogen generated at AGIG’s Hydrogen Park South Australia.
The state government said the initial testing of a prototype hybrid-diesel railcar is also progressing well, with a second railcar fitted with the ‘energy storage and recovery system.’ This two-car train set is the first of 44 diesel railcars expected to be fitted with the hybrid system.
This new system works by storing kinetic energy generated when the train brakes to an onboard battery, converting it into electrical energy to power normal train operations, reportedly decreasing fuel consumption by approximately 16%.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/11/green-hydrogen-offtakers-can-shape-industrys-development/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"AUGUST 11, 2023",Green hydrogen offtakers can shape industry’s development,"Casting doubt on green hydrogen’s utility is a popular sport. High capital costs and the vast spaces needed for associated renewables are cited as the main reasons preventing this clean energy source being commercially viable.
Hydrogen’s potential as a clean energy source has been widely discussed in recent years, driven by events such as the war in Ukraine. Hydrogen’s popularity stems from its ability to store and release energy without greenhouse gas emissions when extracted from water using renewable energy – or with carbon sequestration when the gas is produced using fossil fuels.
This has made hydrogen a critical component of energy planning as a “low to no”-CO2 fuel source for hard-to-electrify segments of the transportation and heavy industry sectors.
The $2/kg mark is generally thought the sweet spot for hydrogen to become a commercially viable alternative fuel. Estimates suggest hydrogen could be produced at $2 at the factory gate by 2030 in countries with good renewables.
In Australia, we can quite easily reach the magical $2 mark – or less – by 2030, with growing demand in domestic and export markets. The federal government’s Hydrogen Headstart program, announced in May’s budget, showcases Australia’s commitment to the industry’s development. The strategy makes it clear Australia won’t be missing out on the benefits of hydrogen as it will stay on track with developments across other markets including the US, Canada, and Germany. Many Australian industrial organisations estimate the current cost of delivered hydrogen as well above $7/kg, however. Where is the cost differential coming from?

The key to successful hydrogen adoption is a systems approach to project development. Rather than viewing each component of the hydrogen production and delivery system in isolation, it is vital to consider the entire supply chain and to design the system as a whole. This holistic approach will minimise cost, while optimising performance.
Three levers will dramatically reduce the cost of large-scale systems.
Large-scale clean hydrogen production is still in its infancy, with many new projects announced but limited actual development. As a result, customers with large orders can have significant input into the design of hydrogen systems.
For example, customers seeking to build multi-gigawatt projects can engage directly with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to secure tailored technical specifications and get accurate prices.
These prices should consider future delivery timelines as the cost of renewables and electrolysers are likely to significantly decrease in the coming years.
Balance-of-plant costs are often neglected but can take up a significant portion of the expense of renewables and electrolysers. A deep dive into this component can reveal plenty of opportunity for cost reduction.
Companies should start with clarity about their hydrogen requirements and design systems accordingly. For example, an export project will need hydrogen (or a hydrogen carrier) ready to load on a ship upon arrival whereas an iron smelter needs a constant, reliable, daily supply. The various elements of the hydrogen delivery system should be put together with offtake requirement in mind.
As seen on many occasions in South Australia, having electrolyser capacity on site can be useful when costs from the grid go negative, meaning businesses have the opportunity to turn their hydrogen production to generate a profit. This may make hydrogen production a smart addition to the overall system but a set-up wholly reliant on the grid is unlikely to cost-effectively meet the requirements for continuous, reliable hydrogen supply.
To ensure a constant, reliable supply of hydrogen, project proponents must focus on the entire supply chain to safeguard success. When designing large systems, it is tempting to break them up into different components and have people in the team (consultants, engineering firms, or OEMs) design them separately then put them back together. Instead of reducing costs, this approach will lead to higher expense.
Let’s say you need 1 GW of renewables input. The temptation is to design a renewables farm that delivers 1 GW of energy at all times but this is not necessary and is likely to result in high cost. The sun does not shine all the time so an engineer designing the renewable energy supply is likely to add storage (batteries or pumped hydro) or firming through the grid, adding substantially to the cost of electricity, and thus the cost of hydrogen.
Whole-system consideration of energy supply tells us running an electrolyser at a lower capacity factor – with reduced energy costs – can optimize the price of hydrogen. There are multiple and frequent opportunities in the supply chain to firm output at a lower cost. It is important to understand how elements interact rather than focusing on maximizing utilization of any single component.
These three strategies could deliver hydrogen for less than $2/kg, based on experience working alongside organisations across the hydrogen supply chain and taking a systems approach to project development. This will be the key to our future energy security, as indicated by a joint Japanese and Australian consortium comprising governments, universities, and energy institutes.
While there are significant balance of trade opportunities for Australia when it comes to green hydrogen, it would be wise for local industry (with government support) to prioritise the domestic market and then use its learnings to move into export. Not only will this assist with our own decarbonization and create more jobs per kilo of hydrogen, it will also decrease the cost of hydrogen before moving into big export projects.
Exporting is inevitable, however. For example, Japan’s interest in co-firing ammonia in coal plants creates hydrogen demand. Unlike Australia, where electrification is cheaper than using gas for households, Japan’s high electricity prices will keep many households on gas.
As Australian industry reaches scale, and with the support of growing technical knowhow, prices will undoubtedly decline. It will be exciting to see hydrogen follow a similar cost-reduction trajectory as has been witnessed for solar and wind power.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/11/maxeon-to-build-3-gw-cell-and-module-plant-in-us/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,SINGAPORE,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 11, 2023",Maxeon to build 3 GW cell and module plant in US,"Maxeon Solar Technologies has chosen Albuquerque, New Mexico, as the location for its first United States manufacturing expansion. The new 3 GW facility will produce TOPCon PV-silicon cell technology and the Maxeon’s proprietary shingled-cell Performance Line solar modules.
The company said the facility will produce millions of solar modules each year for the growing utility-scale and distributed-generation markets in the U.S.
“I am proud to welcome Maxeon Solar Technologies’ first U.S.-based manufacturing facility to New Mexico,” said Govenor Michelle Lujan Grisham. “This private investment shows how our state programs, paired with President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, have charted a path for New Mexico as a leader in growing the clean energy economy and creating a strong workforce for the future.”
Total investment of the project is expected to be more than $ 1.53 billion, Maxeon reports, and is subject to a successful financial close under the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Title 17 Clean Energy Financing Program. Maxeon is currently in the due diligence stage of its loan application and site selection is an important milestone in completing this process with DOE’s Loan Programs Office.
“Thanks to the support of the Biden administration, the U.S. is now poised to re-shore and scale up a domestic solar supply chain,” said Bill Mulligan, Maxeon CEO.  “We see tremendous opportunity to help the country advance its clean energy agenda while generating strong local economic impact.”
Maxeon selected a 160-acre site located in the community of Mesa Del Sol, and it will include solar cell fabrication, panel assembly, a warehouse, and administrative offices. Maxeon reports that its new plant is expected to be the first large-scale cell and module manufacturing in New Mexico. While 3 GW is the planned capacity, the company said there’s a chance it will increase it to 4.5 GW in the future.
Maxeon expects to begin construction in the first quarter of 2024, with factory ramp-up to commence in 2025. The company currently has manufacturing facilities in Mexico, Malaysia and the Philippines.
Once complete, Maxeon estimates the Albuquerque facility will create up to 1,800 jobs, including highly skilled manufacturing and engineering jobs, and produce millions of solar panels each year for the U.S. market.
“The Inflation Reduction Act has catalysed a new chapter in America’s energy transition. Our new solar cell and panel facility in New Mexico is an ambitious and concrete response to the need to decarbonise the U.S. economy while creating permanent highly skilled local manufacturing and engineering jobs,” Mulligan said. “We expect the new plant will also serve as an anchor to attract further regional investment in the solar supply chain. We are proud to be bringing U.S.-developed technologies back home and to contribute to the reshoring of a domestic solar supply chain.”
The company’s Performance line of solar modules leverages Maxeon’s shingled cell technology, originally developed by SunPower. The technology is protected by 83 granted patents. The 425 W modules use bifacial mono-PERC solar cells made on large-format eight-inch G12 wafers, and have an efficiency of 20.6%, according to Maxeon.
Maxeon was spun off from SunPower in 2020, when both became separate entities. TotalEnergies owns a minority interest in Maxeon. The company is based in Singapore but lists shares on the NASDAQ Capital Markets exchange, The company has approximately 5,000 employees worldwide, based in Mexico (39%), Malaysia (33%) and the Philippines (20%).
