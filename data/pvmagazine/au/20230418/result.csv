The 6 x 4 truck will “in future” be able to handle loads of up to 70 tonnes – but its current haulage capacity isn’t stated.
The company is claiming the truck as an Australia-first, but the announcement is somewhat enigmatic. “Pure Hydrogen has exclusive rights to the truck design in Australia,” it reads – which would suggest the design – and presumably the truck’s technology – is owned elsewhere. It is not clear where the truck was manufactured, but included in the press images are representatives from HDrive – the exclusive Australian distributor for the Wisdom Fujian Motor Co range of hydrogen vehicles.

Following its showcase at the  Brisbane Truck Show on May 18, the ‘Taurus’ will be sent to PepsiCo, which is set to trial it at a Brisbane manufacturing site. The truck will be leased to Pepsi as part of a six-month trial, under the terms of which Pure Hydrogen will be paid just shy of $100,000 (USD 67,000). If successful, PepsiCo will have the option to lease the truck from Pure Hydrogen at monthly fee of $10,554 (excluding GST) over a potential seven-year term.
In this latest announcement, Pure Hydrogen also noted it has “the potential for multi-vehicle orders following the completion of the trial period.”
Pure Hydrogen is also pursuing an agreement with Australia’s largest privately-owned waste management company, JJ Waste & Recycling. In March 2022, it announced it would work with the company to put hydrogen-powered garbage trucks on the streets of south east of Queensland before 2022 is out. While that date passed, the agreement remains in place with Pure Hydrogen saying the garbage trucks are now slated for operations this year, 2023.
At the time of that announcement, Pure Hydrogen said it intended to use H2X Global, in which it holds a 24% stake, to “assist in the assembly of the [garbage] truck.” Again, this seems to confirm Pure Hydrogen’s role as a supplier of externally-manufactured hydrogen technologies.
(It is also worth noting the same investment firm, Liberty Energy Capital, is behind both H2X and Pure Hydrogen. Liberty is H2X’s primary shareholder and owns at 30% stake in Pure Hydrogen.)
Hyzon, a US-based startup cofounded by an Australian, in March showcased a range of hydrogen trucks out of its Noble Park headquarters in Melbourne’s south-east. Its 27-tonne hydrogen trucks are hitting Australian roads in a series of commercial trials this year, including as part of a longterm partnership with RACV, which has ordered three tow trucks.

The use of hydrogen in vehicles has been a hotly debated in Australia, but found a foothold in the heavy vehicle and trucking sector. This is because unlike electric vehicles, which well and truly hold marketshare when it comes to passenger cars, the batteries needed for big trucks are extremely heavy and require downtime to charge.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/18/nz-hydrogen-startup-claims-its-cracked-the-iridium-problem-raises-2-3m-in-seed-round/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NEW ZEALAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 18, 2023","NZ hydrogen startup claims it’s ‘cracked the iridium problem,’ raises $2.3m in seed round","The New Zealand startup, named Bspkl, claims it has already manufactured its catalyst coated membrane products, a component of hydrogen electrolysers, at a commercial scale. Now, with funding from the seed round, the company is hoping to fully commercialise its product over the coming year.
Precious metals like iridium and platinum are typically used in hydrogen electrolyser membranes to maximise output – an expensive and resource-intensive practice. Bspkl says its technology cuts the amount of iridium and platinum needed for electrolysis by 25x, stating loading levels of 0.089 mg/cm2 of iridium and 0.122 mg/cm2 for platinum group metal catalysts.
“We’ve cracked the iridium problem and we know how to manufacture it at scale, we are excited to bring this product to the electrolyser manufacturing market,” Bspkl cofounder and CEO, Christina Houlihan, said.
The startup is a spinout from crown research institute GNS Science. The technology was invented by Jérôme Leveneur while he was an employee at GNS and has reportedly been in development for nearly 10 years.
Leveneur is now Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Bspkl – which will continue to collaborate and conduct research with GNS Science as it commercialises. 
According to Bspkl’s website, its technology is both catalyst and membrane “agnostic” and can be applied as a catalyst layer to any membrane material, “so long as it comes in a dry, roll format.”
The startup is currently focusing on polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysis, though it says it plans to expand into anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysis, hydrogen fuel cells and other related technologies “in the near future.”
Bspkl’s recent seed funding round was led by New Zealand technology investor WNT Ventures and supported by Australian venture capital firm Investible. It also attracted a NZD 750,000 ($690,000) repayable grant from Callaghan Innovation’s Technology Incubator Program.

This makes it the “highest year for new renewable construction commitments on record,” the report says. 
While the wording “construction commitments” hints at the Council using more of a prospective lens, the sharp contrast between SunWiz’s prediction that 2023 would be one of the large-scale segment’s worst years is noteworthy.

On the whole, the report mostly confirms many of the statistics and conclusions publicised in the last months – for instance, that the rooftop solar segment contracted badly in 2022 while residential battery installations grew. The Council landed on established figures, stating there were 34,731 residential battery installations in 2021 reaching around 50,000 in 2022.
The Clean Energy Australia Report points out despite last year’s rooftop market contraction, the segment accounted for more than a quarter (25.8%) of Australia’s renewable energy generation in 2022, with the average system size reaching 8.84 kW. In total, 310,352 small-scale rooftop solar systems were added, totalling 2.7 GW of new capacity – roughly the same capacity as Eraring coal-fired power station.

“If Australia is chasing a target of 82% renewable energy generation by 2030, the good news is that rooftop solar is continuing to do the heavy lifting adding around 3.5 TWh per year,” Clean Energy Council CEO Kane Thornton said. “The challenge is now to maintain this pace right through to 2030.”
Similar to how wind and solar project sizes are trending up towards megaproject status, big battery projects are also getting bigger, the Council concludes. While the number of large-scale batteries under construction at the end of 2022 was also down on the previous year, dropping from 30 to 19, the approximate combined capacity of those batteries actually grew – going from 921 MW/1,169 MWh in 2021 to 1380 MW/2,004 MWh in 2022.

In terms of the Council’s utility-scale outlook, it concluded the total number of projects under construction or financially committed at the end of 2022 stood at 72, up from 66 at the end of 2021. Of these projects, 48 are solar, 21 wind, and three bioenergy. Meanwhile 48 projects were physically under construction leaving 30 in the committed category, it said.

Coming back to the difference in expectations for Australia’s large-scale segment, it could also be that CEC and SunWiz have focussed on slightly different metrics which are impacting the years projects are credited in. 
For instance, the Council’s report says: “While capacity added was down on the previous year (860 MW in 2022 versus 1683 MW in 2021), the larger developments currently under construction should see total generation rise considerably in the coming years.”
SunWiz, on the other hand, credited 2022 as adding some of Australia’s biggest projects to date.

Australia is facing competition in the hydrogen race from other countries that have stimulated their industries through subsidies. Australia is now seeking to create an enabling investment environment through the provision of enhanced regulatory certainty and the development of a domestic hydrogen guarantee of origin scheme as well as grants, incentives, and access to lower interest financing via the Clean Energy Finance Corporation’s $300 million Advancing Hydrogen Fund. “Australia’s announced pipeline of over 100 hydrogen projects is worth around $230-300 billion of potential investment. This represents close to 40% of all global clean hydrogen project announcements, and underlines Australia’s potential to be among the global leaders,” said Chris Bowen, Australia’s minister for Climate Change and Energy, in the State of Hydrogen 2022 publication. The report explains that, as of December 2022, only one project with a 10 MW capacity or higher has passed FID from this pipeline of investment.
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has announced $50 million for two funding rounds targeting research and development for renewable hydrogen and low-emission iron and steel. “Funding for successful research and development projects will be provided over two phases, with an initial laboratory-based research phase followed by a commercialisation phase aimed at scaling up and demonstrating research breakthroughs,” said ARENA. $25 million will be allocated to each of the funding rounds, with grant funding for successful applicants expected to range between $500,000 and $5 million.
Subsidised hydrogen produced via electrolysis from renewable (green) or nuclear power (pink) can reach levelised production costs under USD 2/kg in the United States. “Fully depreciated operating nuclear plants yield higher capacity factors and, when only accounting for operating expenses, pink hydrogen can reach production levels lower than green hydrogen,” said Lazard and Roland Berger in a new study. The LCOE report then analyses the levelised cost of green and pink hydrogen using PEM and alkaline electrolysers under unsubsidised and subsidised scenarios. LCOH for green hydrogen with PEM electrolysers goes from USD 0.48 to USD 1.81 ($0.72 –$2.70) with subsidies and is in the range of USD 2.75 to USD 4.08 without subsidies. LCOH for green hydrogen with alkaline electrolysers goes from USD 1.16 to USD 2.99 with subsidies and is in the range of USD 3.47 to USD 5.29 without subsidies. LCOH for pink hydrogen with PEM electrolysers goes from USD 0.83 to USD 2.83 with subsidies and is in the range of USD 3.79 to USD 5.78 without subsidies. LCOH for pink hydrogen with alkaline electrolysers goes from USD 1.68 to USD 4.28 with subsidies and is in the range of USD 4.77 to USD 7.37 without subsidies. The report also explained that “while hydrogen-ready natural gas turbines are still being tested, preliminary results, including our illustrative LCOH analysis, indicate that a 25% hydrogen by volume blend is feasible and cost competitive.”
Hopium said it wants to prioritise the development of its technology to capitalise on its expertise quickly, while “keeping the Hopium Machina in sight.” The French company reorganized its activities around two divisions: Hopium Technologies, which develops the fuel cell for the professional market, and Hopium Automotive, whose mission is to develop a range of hydrogen vehicles for the general public.
Toyota announced releasing details for three new Crown models. One of them, the Sedan Crown car, is a hydrogen fuel cell model. The car is expected to be launched in autumn 2023. The new model will be the company’s second FCEV offering after Toyota Miral.

Netherlands-based startup Airturb has developed a 500 W hybrid wind-solar power system that can be used for residential or off-grid applications.
“The system consists of a vertical axis wind turbine with a modified helical Savonius shape and a base with four monocrystalline panels,” CEO Serkan Kilic told pv magazine.”It has a roof load of 131 kg/m2.”
The solar base consists of a structure made of galvanised steel and rubber. It measures 1.14 m x 1.14 m x 20 mm and weighs 35 kg. It can host four solar panels with power outputs of 30 W each. It includes four Eco Line ES30M36 modules from Germany-based Enjoy Solar.
“The base can also host other types of solar panels,” said Kilic.
The small wind turbine measures 1.8 m x 1.14 m x 1.14 m and weighs 70 kg. It has a ballast weight ranging from 70 kg to 100 kg and can operate with a temperature ranging from -25 C to 60 C. Every panel is made with glass fibre reinforced polyester, weighs 1.5 kg, and measures 1.5 m x 0.7 m x 1.5 mm. 
The wind power system also includes a 300 W axial flux PMS alternator (PMSA) that converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy characterised as a three-phase alternating current. The hybrid system features a DualVolt Hybrid Inverter with an output of 500 W.
“It is engineered, developed, and manufactured by Airturb,” Kilic said.
The device measures 540 mm x 430 mm x 139 mm and weighs 25 kg. It must be placed separately on site, with a maximum distance to the system of 25 meters. Airturb offers the systems in two versions, with or without solar panels.
“Both models are pre–assembled by Airturb and delivered on-site by the installer,” Kilic said. “Currently, only the system including the base and solar panels are available. The system without the base and solar panels is being developed and we will offer it from the third quarter of this year.”
The complete package with the solar base and the DuoVolt wind inverter costs €4,235 ($7,566), not including installation costs, according to the company’s website.
“The system is engineered, designed, and developed in The Netherlands, manufactured in Turkey and assembled in The Netherlands,” said Kilic.
