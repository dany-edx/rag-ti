Planning documents indicate construction of the Great Lakes Battery, being developed near the town of Poatina approximately 50 kilometres south of Launceston, is expected to begin by the middle of next year. It is anticipated the first stage will take about 18 months to complete with the battery energy storage system likely to commence operations in 2026.
Neoen said once completed, the first 140 MW/280 MWh stage will provide rapid-response services, helping to stabilise the grid and increase number of renewable projects in Tasmania.
“The purpose of the battery and associated infrastructure is to provide battery storage with renewable energy for grid stabilisation to the Tasmanian electricity network,” the developer said.
“The battery will provide a variety of services including frequency control and load shifting, which are both necessary for the development of more renewable energy.”
Neoen indicated that the power of the battery is likely to be contracted for an optimal use of the technology.
The Great Lakes Battery is to be built on a four-hectare site near TasNetwork’s existing Palmerston Transend substation, approximately 2.5 km northeast of Poatina.
Neoen said the site, within the proposed Central Highlands Renewable Energy Zone, is ideally located to maximise the benefit of the battery storage to the Tasmanian electricity network.
“The Palmerston Transend substation is centrally placed in the state and is the hub of Tasmania’s highest voltage network with direct connections to the state’s three major load centres of Devonport, Launceston and Hobart,” Neoen said.
“It is hoped that a battery in this location can play its part in supporting the Tasmanian government to achieve a smooth transition towards their goal of 200% renewable energy output, based on 2022’s figures.”
The Great Lakes Battery is one of 12 big battery projects Neoen has in operation or under development in Australia.
Among them is the now 150 MW/193.5 MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia, the country’s first big battery when it was built in 2016. Other projects include the 300 MW/450 MWh Victorian Big Battery, near Geelong, which is currently Australia’s largest battery, the 200 MW/400 MWh Blyth Battery storage system in South Australia and a 1 GW/4 GWh battery being built near the town of Collie in Western Australia.
Neoen’s solar projects include the recently commissioned 400 MW Western Downs Solar Farm in Queensland. Developed on a 1,500 ha site near Chinchilla in Queensland, the project will also include a 270 MW/540 MWh battery energy storage system.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/22/aemc-pushes-for-reform-to-support-consumer-energy-resources/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2023",AEMC pushes for reform to support consumer energy resources,"Consumer energy resources are expected to play a critical role in the energy transition, but the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) has warned that the technical standards defining how the devices interact with each other and the power system need reshaping as the rapid uptake of these resources continues.
Following a self-initiated review of technical standards for consumer energy resources (CER), the AEMC has said immediate action by industry, jurisdictions and market bodies is needed to improve compliance with existing and future standards and to achieve the full potential benefits of CER.
In its final recommendations published this week, the AEMC also calls for energy ministers to lead the development of a new regulatory framework for CER technical standards, warning that failure to do so could threaten the secure and reliable operation of the power network.
“Individual consumers in the National Electricity Market (NEM) continue to install and connect record amounts of new CER to the power grid,” the AEMC said, noting that the investment is “a tremendous opportunity to advance Australia’s transition to a decarbonised economy.”
The AEMC did however acknowledge that the ability of CER to contribute to the broader power grid depends on the extent to which these devices operate consistently and predictably.
“With this transition to a more decentralised power grid, the technical standards for how CER devices interact with the broader power grid is increasingly important for the NEM’s security and reliability,” it said.
The AEMC said monitoring conducted by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) shows that a large number of recently installed CER devices do not comply with existing standards in the NEM.
“This presents immediate concerns for the operation of the power system which, if not addressed, will be exacerbated as more CER is connected,” the Commission said, adding that “CER devices that do not comply with CER technical standards pose a threat to power system security.”
To address these challenges, the AEMC has recommended the industry, jurisdictions and the market bodies move to simplify the settings for CER devices manufactured and sold in Australia, promote compliant installation, and support the ongoing compliance of devices connected to the power system.
However, the AEMC said that regulatory constraints limit the level of compliance that can be achieved under the existing framework and longer-term governance reform is required to achieve consistent and enduring compliance with CER technical standards.
“We recommend jurisdictions lead the development of a national regulatory framework for CER technical standards would help ensure a more enduring national framework for CER technical standards,” the Commission said.
The AEMC said it has already undertaken a preliminary assessment of four potential reform options, including creating a new national technical body to oversee the setting of, and compliance with, CER technical standards for the NEM.
Another option includes expanding the role of the Australian Energy Regulator and the AEMC to allow for the comprehensive setting and enforcement of CER technical standards.
A third option would see the role of the Clean Energy Regulator expanded, allowing it to set and ensure compliance with CER technical standards on a nationally consistent basis.
The fourth option entails the enforcement of national requirements under jurisdictional frameworks to ensure national consistency in the setting and enforcement of standards.
The AMEC said compliance with technical standards will provide distribution network service providers (DNSPs) and the AEMO with more certainty about the operation of CER connected to the power grid.
“An alternative scenario, in which CER interactions are unpredictable and unreliable, would leave device owners unable to derive the maximum benefit possible from their investment in these zero or low emissions assets and threaten the secure operation of the overall power system,” it said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/22/origin-buyout-faces-hurdle-as-major-investor-ups-stake/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2023",Origin buyout faces hurdle as major investor ups stake,"Pension fund giant AustralianSuper has increased its stake in takeover target Origin Energy, the country’s second largest energy generator and retailer, in a move that threatens to complicate the proposed $18.7 billion buyout led by Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management.
AustralianSuper has raised its holding in Origin to 13.68%, an increase of 1.02 percentage points. The move gives the pension fund a greater say on whether the Brookfield-led consortium’s acquisition goes ahead since it requires the approval of at least 75% of the votes cast.
Origin agreed in March to the offer from Brookfield and United States-headquartered energy infrastructure investment giant EIG Partners’ MidOcean Energy but AustralianSuper this week said the company’s share price is well below its value estimate, suggesting that the bidding consortium will need to increase its takeover offer to secure the energy company.
“Origin’s current share price is substantially below our estimate of its long-term value and this is why we have increased our holding in the company,” AustralianSuper said in a statement.
“Origin has a unique portfolio of market-leading energy assets and an advantaged position to capture value from the energy transition.”
The takeover vote, which requires the approval of at least 75% of the votes cast, and more than 50% of Origin investors in number voting, is not expected before the end of the year or early next year.
The Brookfield offer is still subject to several conditions, including securing approval from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the Foreign Investment Review Board and other regulators. The ACCC is due to release its ruling on the transaction on October 12, having already twice delayed the date.
If the acquisition goes ahead, it is expected the bidding partners will split the business, with Brookfield taking Origin’s energy generation and retailing businesses while MidOcean would acquire Origin’s gas business, including its interest in Australia Pacific LNG.
Brookfield said if the proposal is successful, it would invest an additional $20 billion to $30 billion to develop up to 14 GW of new renewable generation and storage assets within the Origin Energy business by 2033.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/22/p-type-solar-products-may-be-phased-out-by-2026-as-n-type-tech-rapidly-expands/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2023",P-type solar products may be phased out by 2026 as n-type tech ‘rapidly’ expands,"From pv magazine Global
Analysis and data by Taiwan-based industry analysts TrendForce show that the superior conversion efficiencies of n-type cells has led to “rapidly” expanded capabilities in 2022 and primed the market for competition. This has led TrendForce analysts to believe p-type PERC capacities could be phased out by 2025.
“Currently, PERC cell technology for producing p-type cells stands as the market’s mainstay,” the report said. “However, with the step-by-step realisation of large-scale n-type cell capacities, there looms a risk that a substantial part of PERC cell technology capacities may be phased out within the forthcoming two to three years.”
Analysis suggests that as n-type silicon incrementally comes online there might be a sporadic shortage of high-quality silicon materials and wafers fit for n-type cells. “This could further establish a noticeable price disparity between n-type silicon wafers, and their p-type counterparts,” the report says, which may lead to a noticeable price difference between the two technologies.
Polysilicon supply poses its own problems. Although supply remains “abundant,” TrendForecast warned that if production continues to surge for nN-type cells there could be an oversupply of p-type silicon causing its price to drop faster.
TrendForecast predicts supply could reach 68.8% capacity by the end of 2023 and 40.3% capacity by the end of 2025. “By 2023’s end, it is projected that the total production capacity of polysilicon will reach 2.072 million MT,” the report said. “The actual output of silicon materials is expected to be 1.483 million MT, sufficient to support over 600 GW of solar panel consumption (given a silicon consumption rate of 0.245 MT/GW). This aligns with an annual installation demand of approximately 370-390 GW, indicating a clear oversupply of silicon.”
TrendForce said demand and limited output may lead to periodic shortages of n-type silicon, which would level out prices.
Silicon wafer production capacity is expected to reach roughly 921.6 GW by the end of the year, the report said, with silicon wafer manufacturers reacting to the n-type cell scramble by “rapidly” transforming operations and scaling up output. This may once again impact p-type cells.
“With the inclusion of rectangular silicon wafers occupying a portion of this capacity, certain dimensions of p-type wafers might experience short-term supply shortages, potentially failing to meet immediate demands,” TrendForce said. “If the n-type cell rollout falls short of expectations, there remains a risk of n-type wafer oversupply.”
But as N-cell capacity deployment experiences delays, PERC tech will most likely remain the victorious technology for 2023, the report said. Total wafer capacity primarily attributed to N-type TOPCon cell technology is expected to reach 1,172 GW by the end of the year – a 106% increase since 2022, the report said.
“However, TrendForce has observed some delays in the actual deployment of N-type cell capacity. Given the existing price difference between N-P type wafers, PERC technology is anticipated to retain its leading position in the market this year, although the penetration rate of TOPCon cells will accelerate.”
