If cricket went in to bat for it, AFL tackled it and soccer teamed up, the combined effect would be to mitigate 310,000 tonnes of carbon emissions over two decades, while the sports themselves could save a combined total of $3.7 million each year.
“Sports in Australia face a growing threat from climate change,” said Australian Conservation Foundation Campaigns (ACF) Director Paul Sinclair when he announced this new collective push last week.
He said that global warming, driven primarily by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas, “is drying out sports grounds, disrupting events and increasing health risks for players.”
At the peak of the devastating 2019-2020 fire season, Sydney FC’s Alexander Baumjohann likened playing football in Australia to “smoking 50 cigarettes a day”.
The ACF report is part of a trend to identify the benefits that can accumulate when whole industries or associations take up the challenge of decarbonising. Last week it was Federally controlled airports; now, as the soccer and AFL seasons hit their stride, sport is coming under the sun’s influence.
Some of the biggest trophies in the race to be 100% powered by clean energy by 2030 are calculated to be: AFL’s Metricon Stadium in Carrara, home of the Gold Coast Suns, which SPREE calculates has 1.6 Megawatts of clean energy potential; The Sydney Cricket Ground with space for 1 MW of generation; and the Darwin headquarters of Football NT which could soon kick off under lights powered by 406 kilowatts of solar PV.
A feature in The Canberra Times on the weekend saw Weston Creek Tennis Club claiming an early victory and a “warm fuzzy feeling” from its installation of 25 solar panels on its clubhouse, given a $12,000 Federal Government grant in 2020.
The Club followed best practice, reported the Times, by first improving its energy efficiency with the installation of LED lights to replace halogen globes in its light towers.
“From the biggest stadium to the smallest clubrooms …” Sinclair urged Australian sports to work together.
An additional high-level assessment of the solar potential of regional and community clubs across AFL, cricket and soccer alone came up with some 400 square metres of viable but as yet unused roof space on club facilities.

The report, published in three parts to really hone in on the three major sports, goes into satisfying detail, listing the potential of individual club headquarters, and providing images of the most solar-suitable club buildings, with aerial shots of panels superimposed on key sites offering direct inspiration.

Collingwood footballer Jordan Roughead gives his endorsement to ACF’s Sports going solar challenge, saying, “If we can work as a team towards a common goal to protect our climate and our environment, our impact will be significant.”
ACF is also moving the goalposts to favour a big win, having contracted the Australian Energy Foundation to provide 75 free energy coaching sessions to sports clubs, which will help them work out a business case for solar installation. Register interest here!

The option is one of several recommendations of the Energy Security Board (ESB), the chief energy advisor to Australian governments on electricity market reform. The board on Friday released a vision to redesign the National Electricity Market as it transitions to clean energy.
The key challenges of the transition are ensuring it is smooth (without blackouts) and affordable, as coal and gas generators close and are replaced by renewable energy.
The redesign has been two years in the making. The ESB has done a very good job of identifying key issues, and most of its recommendations are sound. But its proposal to change the way electricity generators and retailers strike contracts for electricity, if adopted, would be highly counterproductive – bad both for consumers and for climate action.
The National Electricity Market (NEM) covers every Australian jurisdiction except Western Australia and the Northern Territory. It comprises electricity generators, transmission and distribution networks, electricity retailers, customers and a financial market where electricity is traded.
Electricity generators in the NEM comprise older, polluting technology such as gas- and coal-fired power, and newer, clean forms of generation such as wind and solar. Renewable energy, which makes up about 23% of our electricity mix, is now cheaper than energy from coal and gas.
Wind and solar energy is “variable” – only produced when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing. Technology such as battery storage is needed to smooth out renewable energy supplies and make it “dispatchable”, meaning it can be delivered on demand.
Some say coal generators, which supply dispatchable electricity, are the best way to ensure reliable and affordable electricity. But Australia’s coal-fired power stations, some of which are more than 40 years old, are becoming more prone to breakdowns – and so less reliable and more expensive – as they age. This has led to some closing suddenly.
Without a clear national approach to emissions targets, there’s a risk these sudden closures will occur again.
To address reliability concerns, the ESB has recommended a measure known as the “physical retailer reliability obligation”.
In a nutshell, the change would require electricity retailers to negotiate contracts for a certain amount of “dispatchable” electricity from specific generators for times of the year when reliability is a concern, such as the peak weeks of summer when lots of people use air conditioning.
Currently, the Australian Energy Market Operator has reserve electricity measures it can deploy when market supply falls short.
But under the new obligation, all retailers would also have to enter contracts for dispatchable supply. This would likely require buying electricity from the coal generators that dominate the market. This provides a revenue source enabling these coal plants to remain open even when cheaper renewable energy makes them unprofitable.
The ESB says without the change, the closure of coal generators will be unpredictable or “disorderly”, creating price shocks and reliability risks.
Even the ESB concedes the recommendation comes with considerable risks. In particular, the board says it may:
In short, the policy could potentially lock in increasingly unreliable, ageing coal assets, stall new investment in new renewable energy storage such as batteries and pumped hydro and increase market concentration.
It could also push up electricity prices. Electricity retailers are likely to pass on the cost of these new electricity contracts to consumers, no matter how much energy that household or business actually used.
The existing market already encourages generators to provide reliable supply – and applies strong penalties if they don’t. And in fact, the NEM experiences reliability issues for an average of just one minute per year. It would appear little could be added to the existing market design to make generators more reliable than they are.
Finally, the market is dominated by three large “gentailers” – AGL, Energy Australia and Origin – which own both generators and the retail companies that sell electricity. The proposed change would disadvantage smaller electricity retailers, which in many cases would be forced to buy electricity from generators owned by their competitors.
Australia’s gentailers are heavily invested in coal power stations. The proposed change would further concentrate their market power while propping up coal.
If coal-fired power stations are protected from competition, it will deter investment in cleaner alternatives. The recommendation, if adopted, would delay decarbonisation and put Australia further at odds with our international peers on climate policy.
The federal and state governments must work together to develop a plan for electricity that facilitates clean energy investment while controlling costs for consumers.
The plan should be coordinated across the states. Without this, we risk creating a sharper shock later, when climate diplomacy requires the planned retirement of coal plants. Other nations have acknowledged the likely demise of coal, and it’s time Australia caught up.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/03/nsw-feed-in-tariffs-to-drop-in-line-with-falling-wholesale-electricity-prices/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MAY 3, 2021",NSW feed-in-tariffs to drop in line with falling wholesale electricity prices,"All-day solar feed-in tariffs (FiTs) in New South Wales are set to fall according to draft recommendations of the state’s Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal (IPART) released last week. The proposed addition of time-of-day FiTs will see the benefits shift towards households and businesses that also have battery storage, and who generate enough excess electricity to export to the grid during the evening peak electricity-demand period.
The current all-day benchmark range for 2020-2021 is 6.0 to 7.3 cents/kilowatt hour; the draft decision for 2021-2022 is to reduce that range to 4.4 to 5.9 c/kWh.
Introduction of a time-of-day structure could see exports from 3pm to 4pm priced at 6.4-8.8 c/kWh and from 5pm to 6pm increase up to 17 c/kWh, when solar irradiance is typically low — favouring the battery brave.
“Our draft guide is lower than the most recent years due to decreasing electricity prices,” said Tribunal member, and contributor to the IPART report, Sandra Gamble. 
It makes sense that FiTs will follow the trends in wholesale prices for electricity, and IPART is basing its recommendations to energy retailers on forecasts that wholesale electricity prices will continue on a downward trajectory, caused largely by an increase in the supply of renewable energy generated by around 500,000 NSW households and small businesses with rooftop solar installed.

But this IPART recommendation, which retailers are not obliged to take into account, comes on the heels of a draft determination by the Australian Energy Market Commission that network operators would impose charges on rooftop solar exported to the grid, in order  to incentivise PV-enabled premises to self-consume more of their generated energy — another development that will favour battery uptake.
This is expected to avoid overloading grid capabilities at peak times which is leading to caps on the size of system allowed to connect to the grid in some areas, or to new customers being limited to zero-export solar options.
“Doing nothing is not an option because blocking people’s power exports will cost them now and more in future”, argued Ben Barr, Chief Executive of the AEMC when the determination was issued in March. He added, “While export charges on a 4−6 kW system might lead to a marginal drop in solar earnings, owners will face that same drop if they are constrained from exporting energy just 10% of the time.”
The draft determination was quickly branded a “solar tax”, with industry players saying it will penalise those who have invested in solar, by skimming off some of the income they make from exports, ostensibly to help fund network upgrades needed to enable two-way flow of energy and allow more solar into the grid.
The solar industry’s concerns with this proposal are many, with the Clean Energy Council immediately responding to draft saying it raised more questions than answers. Among them: Whether such a scheme would be mandatory; whether export charges would be applied to all customers; whether zero export limits would continue to be imposed; whether ombudsmen would be appointed to intervene on solar customers’ complaints; and whether distribution networks would be required to fix poor voltage management before or after the reforms come into effect.
The Community group Solar Citizens said at the time, “The notion that big energy companies will do the right thing by their customers is fanciful.”
In terms of income reductions, AEMC Chief Executive, Ben Barr said the Commission had modelled the impact of network-imposed export charges, and said customers without solar, who still make up 80% of grid connections, “would see their bills drop because they would no longer pay for solar export services they weren’t using”.
As IMPART explains, all electricity customers currently pay “an average of around $41 per year to subsidise customers with solar panels, and a further $55 per year (on the an average bill) for other ‘green costs’ (including subsidies for the Renewable Energy Target, the Climate Change Fund, and the Energy Saving Scheme)”.
The 20% of customers with solar would see export charge impacts dependent on the size of their solar system. Said Barr, “A 4-6 kW system would still earn on average $900 [per year] — about $70 less than now. But this impact could look very different if they took up options that rewarded them for using the system differently — such as self-consuming power.”
Late last month the Victoria Energy Policy Centre challenged the AEMC calculations, and suggested that according to its own maths and modelling, the AEMC proposal was “likely to leave solar homes with little or no income from rooftop solar exports”.
IPART insists that the primary benefit of having solar on your roof is savings on the energy you have to pay for from the grid.

In NSW, says Gamble, “A typical customer can save $750 per year on their electricity bills by using electricity they generate with their solar panels, instead of buying this electricity from their retailer.”
In apparent contrast to Barr’s figures, she adds that PV owners can then typically add “about $200 per year in feed-in tariff revenue.”
The difficulty in correlating disparate data and estimates calculated across different jurisdictions and with different parameters is heightened by the fact that retailers offer customers quite different FiTs, in NSW sometimes exceeding the range recommended by IMPART, depending on their overall energy package.
Complexity and the certainty only of ongoing change characterise the system at present, but Solar Citizens says the AEMC’s proposed changes are likely to disincentivise investment in rooftop solar at a time when the world urgently needs to decarbonise.
IPART’s proposed changes in NSW tariffs definitely favour additional investment in battery installation and more sophisticated energy management to maximise returns.

Submissions to IPART’s draft report must be made by 24 May 2021
Feedback and submissions to the AEMC’s draft determination must be received by 13 May 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/03/how-to-retrieve-36-in-power-losses-at-the-solar-to-electrolysis-end-of-hydrogen-production/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MAY 3, 2021",How to retrieve 36% in power losses at the solar-to-electrolysis end of hydrogen production,"Hydrogen from electrolysis for under $2 a kilo? Australian entrepreneurs, Ian and Tony Schirmer have developed a missing link in the race to low-cost hydrogen, with a proposal to use their CQSola industrial solar power controllers to connect solar generation directly to the terminals of electrolysers — no double DC-to-DC conversion — which saves the 9-15% loss of power going to hydrogen that those processes incur.
That’s in addition to the 21%+ additional power CQSola claims its device can help solar farms to generate by ensuring each panel works to its maximum capacity, unhampered by its neighbours in a typical string arrangement.
pv magazine Australia originally covered the solar optimiser devised by the Schirmers —  electrical engineer Ian, former Products and Services Innovation Manager at Ergon Energy is relentlessly questing to improve clean energy performance; and his son Tony, who brings business, cloud systems and coding expertise to the mix — back in August 2019.
Late last year, the start-up was feted by the office of the Queensland Chief Entrepreneur, and since then has discovered further potential applications of its direct-control and monitoring device that will greatly improve the economic case for solar-generated hydrogen.
The revelation came about when CQSola was “contacted by a representative from the Asian Development Bank who was scouting out new technologies for green hydrogen production”, Ian tells pv magazine Australia. The ensuing discussion prompted the Schirmers to investigate their technology through a green-hydrogen lens.
“We discovered that we can hook it up from the solar panels directly to hydrogen electrolysers, cutting out a whole heap of machinery and electronics in the middle,” says Ian.
Since hydrogen production and re-energisation are notorious for losing power at every conversion turn, reducing the number of processes involved is an obvious way to ensure more green energy is captured, and lower the cost per kilo.

Ian adds that because electrolysers are a form of energy-storage — “you charge the electrolyser to get hydrogen and discharge that to get energy” — the technology could also enable battery energy storage systems (BESSs) and uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) to be directly charged from the DC side of solar farms, again reducing the loss of energy through conversions.
The Schirmers say it was a natural progression for CQSola to begin working on the design of high-voltage electrolysers, by “hooking existing electrolysers up in series to get a higher-voltage electrolyser,” says Ian.
“The problem,” adds Tony, “is that at the moment the control for that system doesn’t exist.” He explains it would generally be achieved via a DC busbar, but “to get the power onto the DC busbar you need to have a DC-to-DC conversion and a DC-to-DC conversion on the actual charge controller. We’ve built all that into our controller.
“Essentially when you connect our product in a string, you’re creating a busbar with a charge controller on it and taking out those big conversion losses.”
CQSola has plans to partner with an electrolyser manufacturer to enable higher-voltage equipment, with the aim of more efficiently producing hydrogen from the same amount of renewable energy.
As a solution for driving greater efficiencies in the green hydrogen value chain, the CQSola controller was recently endorsed in an industry webinar by Stephen B. Harrison founder of Europe-based sbh4 Consulting which specialises in all aspects of hydrogen production.
As part of the EQ World Hydrogen Large-scale Electrolysis webinar, aired in mid-April, Harrison posited that efforts to improve the performance of photovoltaic modules have plateaued in terms of return on R&D effort — “we need to look at other weak links in the photovoltaic chain” in order to economically feed mega- and giga-scale electrolysers.
Greater productivity of solar infrastructure will be one of the most significant contributors to lowering the cost of hydrogen.
Harrison singled out CQSola as “a very, very clever power-management device” that “solves a lot of the problems of solar farms” to give “20-30%, maybe even a 40%, uplift in power generation”. 
Increasing productivity of solar farms and reducing losses in conversions from solar to electrolyser by the percentages CQSola says are achievable using its technology, could make cents — perhaps enough to cross the H2 for under $2/kg rubicon.
