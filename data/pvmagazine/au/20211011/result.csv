The  business case for energy storage has grown significantly over that time.
Genex recently diversified its development of energy storage, from the original slow-burn 250 MW/2000 MWh Kidston Pumped Hydro Project — under development as part of the Kidston Clean Energy Hub on the site of the disused Kidston Gold Mine in Far North Queensland — to include the Bouldercombe Battery Project (BBP)
A two-hour-duration (50 MW/100 MWh) installation of 40 Tesla Megapacks, BBP will be built on land leased from transmission provider Powerlink beside its Bouldercombe substation, 20 kilometres south of Rockhampton.
Kidston said today the deployment of capital ($55-60 million in total CapEx costs including financing costs, owner’s costs and contingency funding) into Bouldercombe diversifies the company portfolio by both geography and technology, and anticipates a growing need for energy storage to balance the intermittency of renewable solar and wind generation, and “make it firm and reliable for consumers as and when they require the energy”.
Genex Chief Executive Officer, James Harding, and Chief Financial Officer, Craig Francis, elaborated on the business case for the company becoming Queensland’s first mover in the standalone big-battery energy-storage space, capitalising on all that the technology can provide in the current energy landscape and in response to emerging market opportunities. 
Where Kidston Pumped Hydro negotiated a long-term, stable agreement under which Energy Australia will operate the asset for a period of 30 years, thus enabling it to secure favourable finance in large part from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF); Bouldercombe will offer shareholders some of the “cream” now emerging in the market.
Arbitrage is one strong source of revenue: storing energy when demand and prices fall in the middle of the day — in Queensland they’re typically negative due to high rooftop and large-scale solar output — for sale in the evening when demand is at its peak and electricity is commanding higher prices.
Just over a week since five-minute settlement (5MS) was introduced to Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM), replacing the previous averaging of prices over 30 minutes, Harding says Genex has observed greater variation — spikes and troughs — in electricity pricing, which bodes well for battery-storage revenue
The 5MS market reform was intended to encourage fast-response technologies such as batteries by providing a greater price incentive for their services, and Bouldercombe is positioned to take advantage of the change.
Its Megapack battery system, enabled with Tesla’s Autobidder software, will be able to automatically dispatch within milliseconds of receiving and calculating the benefits of responding to a price signal. 
As Harding pointed out, Kidston Pumped Hydro will also be able to ramp up to full generation within 30 seconds, whereas gas-fired technologies lag by minutes.

Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS), he says, are also increasingly in demand in a grid where around 25% of electricity is now typically supplied by renewables and that percentage must grow as more renewables replace retiring coal plants.
“As renewable penetration increases and as other events occur on the network, the balance of frequency which is set at 50 hertz is disturbed,” says Harding. Where demand suddenly exceeds supply, say, when a coal-fired powered generator trips; or when supply exceeds demand, in the case of a load suddenly going offline, a battery can very quickly inject energy or withdraw energy from the network in order to bring that frequency back into balance. 
Coal-fired power plants have traditionally been the frequency stabiliser, but they will increasingly be the cause of imbalance, and in a grid supplied more and eventually only by renewables, more battery capacity will be required to provide a variety of services.
By 2040, Genex calculates 123 GWh of battery capacity will be needed to balance planned growth of renewables into the energy deficit left by retiring coal plants. AEMO figures indicate that 330 MWh of large-scale battery capacity, concentrated in Victoria and South Australia, are currently available to the system.
Major outages are set to become more “unpredictable” says Genex CFO Craig Francis. 
Beyond the day-to-day business case for Bouldercombe, Genex has calculated the services it could have offered to the grid during the recent outages and extended unreliability of the grid caused by this year’s fire at Queensland’s Callide C coal-fired power plant.
The cascading effects on the Queensland network of the May 25 fire were that it tripped Callide’s other two units, and disrupted transmission not only in the region, but to the north and south, thereby also interrupting the generation capacity of surrounding power stations. A resulting 3 GW shortfall in power supply caused blackouts all over the state.
For a period of two hours, the spot price of electricity rose to $15,000/ MWh. Had Bouldercombe been operating that day, says Francis, “it would have made $700,000 or 7% of our projected revenue, in a 24-hour period”.
The rest of the month continued to see volatile prices as the market adjusted to the loss of Callide’s generation, with peak evening prices averaging around $6,000/MWh.
“We’ve done an illustrative analysis of what Bouldercombe would have delivered over that period, had it been operating just on the arbitrage side of things — ignoring FCAS,” says Francis. 
Genex calculates BBP would have earned $3.2 million in net revenues: $700,000 on the 25th of May and a further $2.5 million for the following month.
“If we’re talking about a $10 million average [annual income] forecast, [that’s] some 255% of what we’re forecasting,” said Francis, who emphasises that such events are not included in the base business case for the battery.
“This is outside system normal — just cream, really” he says. It’s “the upside that we see in this project and what we really want to capture in the commercial model”.

Tesla Senior Manager of Project Sales and Business for the APAC region, Maria Cahir also spoke to the Genex audience, about the flexibility of battery technology to be adapted with firmware/software updates that take advantage of emerging market opportunities, such as mimicking inertia.
She said, that as the big spinning turbines of coal and gas generation exit the market, the need for other sources of inertia in the grid is currently reviving the fortunes of old tech such as synchronous condensers, but “Tesla has developed a platform called Virtual Machine mode… a firmware layer that enables batteries to mimic the physics of rotating synchronous machines” and step in with sub-second response to correct frequency or voltage imbalances in the grid.
The firmware is currently being tested for effectiveness using a fraction of the Hornsdale Power Reserve capacity, and Cahir says, “AEMO has been very happy with the data that we’ve generated to date.”
Calculations indicate that “Hornsdale, at 150 megawatts, could provide about 50% of the inertia that’s needed for the entire state of South Australia”.
Bouldercombe will take advantage of such “over-the-air” Tesla software updates as the need arises.

Genex announced at the meeting today that one or two further large-scale batteries for Queensland and New South Wales are part of the company’s Large-Scale Battery Strategy to achieve 2,500 MWh of storage by 2025.
It says it wants to maximise its learnings and relationships with the Queensland Government, federal agencies such as ARENA, Powerlink and Tesla, to further Australia’s decarbonisation, while delivering returns for its shareholders.
Positioned on the backbone of the Queensland grid, in a state that has the potential to be islanded by occasional failures of NSW-Queensland interconnectors, and which has high solar penetration causing “spiky” electricity prices on any day, Bouldercombe has a strong business case.
In fact, says Francis, it is “the first commercially delivered, large-scale battery project in NEM; all the others have long-term government contract support or are receiving subsidies from ARENA.
“I think that’s a really, really big step for the development of battery technology in the NEM itself as we move to support this transition to greater renewable energy.

Developer Wirsol Energy, which has a portfolio of Australian projects to its name, announced last week that it has acquired land rights to develop the 75-85 MWp plant on 120 hectares, 20 kilometres west of Wodonga in Victoria.
Wirsol is a subsidiary of global, German-based renewable energy group, Wircon, and specialises in utility-scale solar. It said in a statement last week that it is looking for solar projects and acquisitions to add to its portfolio; and flagged that battery storage solutions are likely to be part of any development, in order to achieve “optimal performance in the Australian market, whilst supporting the stability of the grid”.
At this stage, Barnawartha will not include a battery, but Wirsol says it will “co-develop” the project with ARP Australian Solar, a privately owned financier, developer and installer with projects listed on its site that include Morwell Solar Farm in the heart of Victoria’s coal country, as well as a 30 MW version of Barnawartha.
A solar farm at Barnawartha was first mooted in 2010 as a 152 MW installation, but a report in the Renewable Albury Wodonga (RAW) Energy newsletter says that was “shelved” due to unfavourable economic conditions.
In 2018, a project on or near the same site as Wirsol is now developing was re-envisaged as a 50 MW solar farm, a joint venture between Melbourne consultancy Heliades, which brokers investment and development opportunities for South Korean companies, and S-Energy, a Korea-based solar panel manufacturer that was spun off from electronics giant Samsung in 2001.
Their joint entity known as Wodonga Solar Power, was reported by The Border Mail in September last year as having failed to secure grid connection for the solar farm, which again caused the project to be abandoned.
Wirsol has a strong track record as a successful developer of solar and battery projects in Australia despite having had to deal with some of the industry’s greatest travails, from Covid-19 challenges to curtailments caused by a quavering grid and grid connection conundrums..
It was project manager of 149 MWp Glenrowan West Solar Farm during its Covid-constrained construction and commissioning phase, and now operates the plant on behalf of German owners Wirtgen Invest, which acquired the rights to develop Glenrowan West in July 2019.

It is co-owner with Edify Energy of the 25 MW/50 MWh Gannawarra Energy Storage System, a pioneering retrofit to Gannawarra Solar Farm that overcame many regulatory hurdles and which reached completion in late 2018.
Wirsol’s other Australian projects to date include the 60 MWp Whitsunday Solar farm in Queensland, the 110 MWp Wemen Solar Farm in north-western Victoria and the 90 MWp Clermont Solar Farm in  Queensland. 
The company says it looks forward to taking the Barnawartha project “through to its ‘shovel-ready’ stage”.
Wirsol’s acquisition of the rights to develop Barnawartha comes in the wake of the Victorian Government’s second reverse auction in support of the Victorian Renewable Energy Target (VRET-2), this time for at least 600 MW of new large-scale renewable energy capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/11/contracts-are-out-for-major-sa-construction-works-on-project-energyconnect/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"OCTOBER 11, 2021",Contracts are out for major SA construction works on Project EnergyConnect,"ElectraNet has awarded two infrastructure providers with deep expertise in renewable energy and large-scale projects the main construction contracts for South Australia’s section of Project EnergyConnect, the long-planned high-voltage electricity connector between South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria that is set to open up renewable-energy grid connections in its path and help stabilise the National Electricity Market.
Downer Group — the engineering, construction and procurement company involved in projects such the 349 MW Limondale Solar Farm and the Chichester solar project powering Fortescue’s iron ore operations in the Pilbrara — may have exited the Australian solar scene early last year, citing grid-connection risks and a lack of new investment, but Downer Utilities Australia will be a major enabler of future renewable energy flows as the chosen transmission-lines contractor to Project EnergyConnect.
Steve Masters, Chief Executive of ElectraNet, explained when he announced the contracts this weekend, that transmission works “include approximately 200 kilometres of 330 kV new transmission lines between the SA/NSW border and the new Bundey Substation near Robertstown,” and a further 10 km of 275 kV lines from Bundey to Robertstown.
“Downer is pleased to be involved in this critical infrastructure project which will improve power security and reliability to South Australia and the National Electricity Market as a whole,” said Grant Fenn, CEO of Downer EDI.
Substation works, including the construction of the new Bundey facility and augmentation of Robertstown and Tungkillo substations, have been awarded to Consolidated Power Projects Australia, specialists in high-voltage infrastructure.
Consolidated Power Projects has engineered the grid connections of many an Australia’s wind farms and more recently big batteries; its contracts have included Crookwell 2 Wind Farm, Snowtown Wind Farm, the Hornsdale Battery Energy Storage System and Wandoan South Battery Energy Storage System. 
It also designed and built grid connections for four New South Wales solar farms, at Dubbo, Narromine, Griffith and Parkes.
“With the contractors now appointed, more information about opportunities for subcontractors to support the delivery of the project will become available,” said Masters.
ElectraNet confirmed in June that it had made the Final Investment Decision to go ahead with the South Australian section of the interconnector from Robertstown to the NSW border, at an estimated cost of $457 million.
Transgrid secured government approval for the first stage of the much longer section of the 900 km connector on the NSW side only late last month. Transgrid’s share of the deal is costed at $1.8 billion.
Acting CEO of Transgrid, Brian Salter said of Energy Connect, “The project will be the critical missing link in the NEM, connecting more renewable generation and reinforcing connectivity between the state grids of NSW, South Australia and Victoria.”
Downer intends to immediately start preliminary work on the project with major construction commencing in early 2022 and commissioning of the transmission line to be “underway in 2023”.
The critical project has been before the regulators and in approvals since 2018, and almost came unstuck this year when Transgrid was unable to finalise its financing arrangements. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation stepped in with a $295 million hybrid security instrument, the biggest investment it has made in its history, which encouraged the private sector to jump on board with more debt facilities.
On both sides of the states’ divide, studies are still underway to assess environmental, social and engineering considerations related to EnergyConnect which is expected to generate 1,700 jobs during construction and increase real incomes in regions hosting the interconnector by $163 million in South Australia and $209 million in NSW.
The project’s Environmental Impact Statement is currently being assessed by the South Australian Government’s Planning and Land Use Services.
Masters said that the awarding of the ElectraNet contracts “is a significant milestone for this landmark electricity infrastructure project”, and assured South Australians that the company’s comprehensive procurement and selection process had resulted in “the best value for money and quality”.

FFI will invest $115 million in the first step of a more than $1 billion operation that will double the world’s green hydrogen-production ability.
With the first electrolysers rolling off the production line by 2023 it will soon produce 2 GW of electrolyser capacity per annum.
Forrest constantly communicates the urgency of ramping up green energy production: “We will not allow the world to keep on cooking — we will not allow our children to inherit a much less stable environment,” he said on Sunday with now familiar fervour.
We're working with Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest to build the world's largest hydrogen-equipment manufacturing facility 🙌 pic.twitter.com/wQXWt8Lnr1
— Annastacia Palaszczuk (@AnnastaciaMP) October 10, 2021

Only two weeks ago, Forrest formed a global green hydrogen organisation, GH2, to be chaired by former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, with the goal of ensuring that by 2050, a quarter of the world’s energy comes from green hydrogen.
FFI itself aims to produce 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030, much of which it intends to integrate into the production processes of heavy industry, such as steel making, to displace fossil fuel use.
Just last week, the billionaire known as “Twiggy”, and Julie Shuttleworth, Chief Executive of FFI — a subsidiary of FMG — announced FFI had acquired a majority share in Netherlands-based High yield Energy Technologies (HyET) Group, which counts among its assets the solar PV module manufacturer HyET Solar.
FFI’s plans to expand the group’s solar manufacturing capability include a 1 GW manufacturing plant in Australia producing HyET lightweight Powerfoil flexible solar modules destined for utility-scale solar farms and building-integrated PV applications.
FFI will also support HyET’s intention to ramp up to 900 MW production in the Netherlands
By manufacturing the flexible solar modules and electrolysers at immense scale, FFI aims to drive down the cost of both products and hasten the delivery of affordable green energy to the world.
The current cost of electrolysers is one factor keeping the price of producing green hydrogen above that of hydrogen produced using natural gas.
Electrolysers split water into its component hydrogen and oxygen molecules; when powered by renewables such as solar and wind, they produce emissions-free hydrogen that can be used to transition otherwise hard-to-abate industrial processes away from fossil fuels.
Cheap hydrogen, produced by excess renewable electricity justifies further processing into ammonia or compression for export.
The International Energy Agency identified shortages in worldwide electrolyser manufacturing capacity, which it calculated at 3 GW a year in 2020, as a threat to the many green hydrogen projects in the global pipeline.
Last year, Europe dominated worldwide capacity with about 60% of electrolyser production, and China pretty much controlled the rest, with 35%. 
“FFI’s goal is to become the world’s leading, integrated, fully renewable energy and green products company, powering the Australian economy and creating jobs for Australia as we transition away from fossil fuels,” Shuttleworth said.
Forrest added that the Queensland facility “is a critical step in Fortescue’s transition from a highly successful pure-play iron ore producer to an even more successful green renewables and resources powerhouse.”
The Queensland plant, to be built in Aldoga, 25 kilometres west of Gladstone, will manufacture not only electrolysers, but cabling and wind turbines to drive production of green hydrogen for global markets.

Forrest said that over the past 15 months he had researched 62 countries to decide on the best location for producing his envisaged full hydrogen kit, and found, “Queensland has the beautiful combination of wind and solar and you have a hard-working, educated people,” he said at yesterday’s event. He also lauded the Queensland Government for already steering the state “into a green hydrogen future”.
Gladstone’s industrial port is well-positioned to take Australian-made electrolysers to the world. Palaszczuk noted its proximity to Asia and Queensland’s already good trading relationships with Asian economies.
In 2019, Queensland exported its first shipment of green hydrogen to Japan as part of a trial jointly conducted by the Queensland University of Technology and JXTG, a Japanese petroleum conglomerate.
Queensland has since announced several hydrogen projects on its sun-drenched turf, but nothing like this.
The FFI manufacturing facility is expected to directly create some 150 jobs during construction and 53 ongoing jobs when operational, but Forrest said the knock-on effects of imminently available, affordable green hydrogen generation will bring manufacturing “roaring back to regional Australia”, creating thousands of jobs.

Swedish thermal storage specialist Azelio has launched a new electro-thermal storage system for commercial applications at the ongoing Intersolar event in Munich, Germany.
The system works in four steps. First, it is charged by a renewable source of electricity, which is then stored in the form of heat in a recycled aluminium alloy, with a phase change at 600 degrees Celsius. The heat is in turn dispatched to a Stirling engine, which is a closed-cycle regenerative heat engine with a permanent gaseous working fluid. The engine generates usable heat with a temperature ranging from 55 to 65 degrees Celsius and electricity that can be utilised on demand at all hours of the day.
The system measures 2.810 x 2.67 x 3.65 m and has a nominal electrical output of 13 kW. One unit’s storage capacity reaches 165 kWh. A system combines units in clusters, for example in 20 units with a storage capacity of 3.3 MWh of electrical output, and thermal energy on top of that. The system is scalable in systems of up to 100 MW, with an initial commercial focus of up to 20 MW installations.
The manufacturer says the product is particularly suitable for commercial and industrial projects in unstable or off-grid locations with an economically viable renewable baseload source. However, the instability of grid prices and supply has enhanced the systems’ relevance also for grid-connected locations.
“The system is designed for daily cycles, which makes it suitable for systems combining solar PV for energy supply during daytime, while charging the storage,” the company’s Director Communications and Marketing, Johan Sahlin, told pv magazine. “The TES.POD then supplies renewable energy during the night or when direct production is insufficient, completing the 24h cycle with renewable energy.”
Production of the TES.POD system was launched at the company’s facilities in Sweden in mid-September. “The production chain consists of the assembly of cylinder kits in the company’s facilities in Åmål, followed by the final assembly of a complete Stirling engine in its factory in Uddevalla,” the manufacturer said in a statement released at the time.
So far, the company has secured orders for two TES.POD units in Sweden and one unit in Dubai as well as a conditional 260 kW/3.3 MWh order from Egypt. “The company’s goal for 2021 is to sign and begin delivery of one or two projects in the size of 100 kW or larger,” the company stated.

Developer Solar Philippines has announced it is offering up sites suitable to host PV projects from its portfolio, in a move which will enable the construction of clean power generation capacity running to “multiple times greater than the country’s total solar capacity to date.”
The company has announced it will be offering up around 10,000ha – chiefly near its own solar projects at Batangas, Tarlac, and Nueva Ecija, on the island of Luzon – so rival PV companies can co-locate facilities nearby and benefit from economies of scale on a model inspired by India’s large, multi-developer solar park sites.
Quoted in a press release issued by Solar Philippines yesterday, to announce the move, founder Leandro Leviste said: “Our aim is no longer to compete with the country’s power companies but to enable them to build projects, to ensure that solar soon becomes the largest source of new energy in the Philippines.
“The problem we need to solve is that, despite there now being significant demand for new solar plants, there is a scarcity of sites. Our SEZs [solar energy zones] will make it easy for any of these power companies that decide to build solar to locate in these zones and start construction that same year. This would not be possible had we not begun the development of these sites six years ago, when others did not believe that large scale solar would be viable. Now the power industry is convinced that it is, we are making available these sites to help others enter the market.”
The Makati city-based solar developer predicted the sites which will take shape as a result can be expected to be installed over the next five years.
On its LinkedIn page, Solar Philippines describes itself as the largest PV developer in Southeast Asia and claims to have 400 MW of operational or under-construction solar projects as part of a “multi-gigawatt” pipeline which includes “the world’s largest off-grid solar projects and the lowest cost solar power purchase agreements in East Asia.”
