Pitt used powers granted to him under the NAIF legislation, set up in 2016 by then-Northern Australia minister Josh Frydenberg.
At the time Frydenberg told parliament the ministerial powers would only be used “to ensure projects which are contrary to the national interest are not funded”.
Pitt reportedly told the head of the NAIF in March he was not convinced the Kaban green energy hub would provide “dispatchable” generation into the national electricity market and he was “not convinced” it would lower power prices.
The veto decision was attacked by Labor’s climate spokesman Chris Bowen, who accused the government of killing off the project because it was against their “non-existent energy policy”.
“North Queensland should be getting 250 new energy jobs and cheaper power bills, but they’ve been hung out to dry,” Bowen said.
“Queensland has the resources and the workers to continue to power the country and the world, but a government that is leaving them behind.”
In a letter obtained by Newscorp, Pitt said the government’s technology investment roadmap policy had identified that the widespread deployment of mature technologies including wind and solar energy would be mainly driven by the private sector unless there was a clear market failure.
He told the head of the NAIF the government’s policy was to support dispatchable generation, which refers to electricity capacity that can be called on when required to support variable solar and wind energy.
“I am satisfied that providing NAIF support for the project would be inconsistent with the objectives and policies of the Commonwealth government. Because of this, I am giving a rejection notice,” he wrote.
Labor’s spokesman on northern Australian, Murray Watt, said the letter showed the government had an “ideological obsession” against renewable energy that was costing jobs and lower power prices.
Neoen Australia, the company behind the project said the blocked funding would have helped build a 157 MW wind farm and 100 MW battery. The project also includes a 320km transmission line upgrade.
Neoen estimated the development could reduce electricity prices for Queensland consumers by $461m over the 30-year lifecycle of the project
Newscorp reported on Thursday that Neoen was disappointed by the government’s decision, but remained committed to the project.
The company has signed a power purchase agreement with the Queensland government-owned agency CleanCo under which it would provide energy to contribute to reaching the state target of 50% renewable energy by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/06/vic-solar-cops-3-million-fine-after-thousands-targeted-with-predatory-tactics/,"INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 6, 2021",Vic Solar cops $3 million fine after thousands targeted with ‘predatory’ tactics,"The Melbourne-based Vic Solar Technologies has been fined $3 million after the Federal Court of Australia found it guilty of multiple breaches of Australian Consumer Law, including making misleading representations to consumers, failing to comply with legal protections for unsolicited consumer agreements and engaging in unconscionable conduct.
Vic Solar’s sole director, Sunny Srinivasan, 31, of Southbank, was hit with a $450,000 fine and disqualified from being a director of any company for five years for his role in the scheme which targeted more than 4,000 customers and delivered the company an estimated $21.4 million over a four-and-a-half-year period.
Vic Solar, which went into administration on November 19, used people employed by third parties to generate sales leads by knocking on homeowners’ doors, advertised a false ‘community bulk-buy’ of solar PV systems and used the details of those who registered interest to engage in door-to-door sales that breached unsolicited consumer agreement laws.
In his decision, Justice O’Bryan said the breaches were “very serious”  contraventions”, labelling the company’s business model as “predatory” and “unfair”.
“The contraventions of the Australian Consumer Law in which Mr Srinivasan was involved were serious breaches of the law,” he said.
“The contraventions were at the centre of Vic Solar’s business model which I found involved trickery and sharp practice, illegality and taking advantage of consumers in their homes when they are more vulnerable to such practice.”

Justice O’Bryan said from June 2014 to December 2018 Vic Solar had engaged in a wide range of contravening conduct in connection with the sale of solar PV systems to residential households.
“In that period, Vic Solar entered into around 4,300 contracts for the supply of solar PV systems through its system of door-to-door lead generation,” he said.
“(The) respondents’ contravening conduct should be characterised as deliberate. It was a central part of Vic Solar’s trading strategy to target consumers in their homes.
“Those misrepresentations were made many thousands of times.”
The court also heard the prices Vic Solar charged for its solar PV systems were above average for systems of similar quality. Witnesses told the court they had paid between $5,500 and $13,500 for solar PV systems while the median market price for systems of equivalent quality were at least $1,000 less and up to $6,000 less (for the higher priced systems).
Justice O’Bryan said Vic Solar had produced only “piecemeal and incomplete” financial records but estimates suggest the company generated at least $21.4 million from the sale of residential solar PV systems in the period from June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2018 alone.
“Based on the evidence … it is possible that the contravening conduct enabled Vic Solar to levy charges that were thousands of dollars higher than prevailing market prices,” Justice O’Bryan said.
“The consumer loss, across all of the sales made by Vic Solar, was therefore potentially in the millions of dollars. It is not possible, though, to be more precise.”
Srinivasan did not participate in the proceeding and Justice O’Bryan said there had been “no evidence of contrition on the part of either respondent”.
Minister for Consumer Affairs Victoria Melissa Horne said the case served as timely reminder for businesses considering these types of sales tactics.
“We won’t tolerate dodgy sales practices in Victoria, and this strong outcome puts companies doing the wrong thing on notice that they’ll be held accountable,” she said.
“Helping Victorians to save on energy bills by going solar is a key priority for the government, and consumers should be able to investigate installing panels without the risk of being misled or ripped off.”
Horne said consumers should be alert to aggressive sales techniques and to contact Consumer Affairs Victoria if they felt they were being treated unfairly by a business.
The decision coincided with the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) officially launching a taskforce to target installers accredited by the Clean Energy Council (CEC) who make false statements in relation to small-scale technology certificate (STC) eligibility.
The CER said it had developed a sophisticated analytical model to identify installers deemed unlikely to have been on-site in accordance with the  CEC install and supervise guidelines.
The guidelines dictate a CEC accredited installer must either undertake the installation or supervise the installation by others. If the accredited person is supervising the installation by others, they must physically attend the site during job set up, mid-installation check-up and testing and commissioning.
CEC accredited installers may be asked to prove they attended the site at all relevant stages of the installation. This could include photographic identification of the accredited installer (with time and date metadata or geo-location data) during installation job set-up, mid-installation check-up, and testing and commissioning stages.
The CER said action can be taken against installers who make false statements regarding their on-site attendance, including cancellation of their accreditation, revocation of their electrical licence and civil proceedings or criminal prosecutions. Claims for STCs may also be failed.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/06/3-1-billion-recycling-opportunity-emerges-as-batteries-boom/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 6, 2021",$3.1 billion recycling opportunity emerges as batteries boom,"Batteries are firming as crucial enablers of Australia’s transition to renewable energy and the CSIRO has identified the increase in battery usage across all sectors, including large-scale, distributed energy resources and the electrification of transport, as the driver for a potential $3.1 billion lithium-ion battery recycling industry.
First commercialised in the 1990s, lithium-ion batteries are a relatively new technology but the market has undergone substantial growth in recent years and the CSIRO has predicted the demand for batteries will accelerate going forward.
“The demand for lithium-ion batteries is increasing globally, fuelled by the increasing electrification of transport and the renewable energy generation storage sector,” said  Dr Anand Bhatt, lead author of the Australian Landscape for Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling and Reuse in 2020 report.
While the electric vehicle (EV) market remains negligible in Australia, accounting for just 0.7% of the 1 million new cars sold annually, the distributed and large-scale battery energy storage sectors continue to grow.
Solar market analyst SunWiz has calculated that 31,269 new residential batteries, totalling 340 MWh, were installed across the nation last year while data provided by the Clean Energy Council (CEC) indicates that since 2018, 8.9 GW of large-scale battery storage has been financially committed, proposed and or approved in Australia.
CEC chief executive Kane Thornton said that growth is expected to continue in 2021 with 15 large-scale battery projects already announced this year, representing 6.6 GW of storage and $4.3 billion in investment.
“The commercial case for batteries will continue to improve as battery technology advances and new markets are established to reward the services they provide,” Thornton said.

Australia’s largest energy retailer, AGL, is among those leading the battery charge, announcing last year it plans to add 850 MW of new large-scale battery storage to its energy generation portfolio by 2024.
The gen-tailer has already announced plans for a 250 MW battery project on the site of its retiring gas-fired Torrens Island Power Station in South Australia along with a series of other mega storage facilities while developers led by Neoen, network owners such as Spark Infrastructure, and service providers such as Transgrid have also announced new battery projects.
The CSIRO has however warned that as demand grows for energy storage and batteries, so too does the amount of lithium-ion battery waste.
The science agency said lithium-ion batteries generally have a life span of 5-10 years (though current development trends are increasing this to 10-15 years). This, combined with batteries used in renewable energy storage systems, means a large volume of end-of-life batteries will soon be on our doorstop.
“This growth is leading to an emerging problem of end-of-life waste management,” Bhatt said.
CSIRO research showed that lithium-ion battery waste is growing by 20% a year and could exceed 100,000 tonnes by 2036.
The agency said if not dealt with properly, lithium-ion batteries pose environmental and safety concerns but Associate Professor Jo Staines, Enterprise Fellow at the University of Melbourne and program lead for the Future Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre, said incorrect disposal is also a missed economic opportunity.
“Lithium-ion batteries contain valuable battery metals and materials that should be recycled and reused,” Staines said.
“The conundrum we face in Australia is that we don’t currently have the volume of spent lithium-ion batteries to justify significant investment, but we want to keep them out of landfill to prevent environmental damage and retain those valuable battery materials in our economy.”

While companies like the Melbourne-based Relectrify are pursuing opportunities to repurpose batteries, a 2018 CSIRO report indicates only 2% of Australia’s lithium-ion battery waste is re-used or recycled.
The CSIRO suggests this lost value could be between $4,400 and $17,200 per tonne of battery translating to a $603 million to $3.1 billion opportunity. If recycled, 95% of materials can be turned into new batteries or used in other high value industries.
“The value for Australia is three-fold,” Bhatt said. “We can draw additional value from existing materials, minimise impact on our environment, and also catalyse a new industry in lithium-ion re-use/recycling.”
The latest report identifies 18 opportunities for industry, government and research institutions to strengthen and grow Australia’s domestic recycling capability with the CSIRO claiming Australia could lead the world in the re-use and recycling of lithium-ion batteries.
Among those opportunities identified in the report are exploring a National Product Stewardship for all batteries and increasing research into developing end markets for the recovered battery materials.

Chief Minister and Treasurer Michael Gunner revealed his government’s spending priorities earlier this week, including among them an extension to the Home and Business Battery Scheme which provides Territory homeowners and businesses with grants of up to $6000 to help fund the purchase of solar PV and battery storage systems.
The grants can be used to either install a solar PV system with an eligible battery or inverter, or install an eligible battery and inverter to complement an existing solar system.
Minister for Renewables and Energy Eva Lawler said the program helped households and businesses make the switch to renewable energy while also delivering stable, reliable and affordable power.
“We want Territorians to have access to the latest and best technology as we build a stronger and more resilient power system for Territory households and businesses,” she said.
“Budget 21-22 sees the Territory focus on renewables – supporting our grid and reaching our 50% target by 2030. We want clean and affordable power for all Territorians.
“Extending the Home and Business Battery scheme is one way this government is creating stability in our grid and creating more jobs for Territorians.”
Lawler said more than 700 households and businesses had already applied for grants during the first round of the scheme with more than 510 applications totalling more than $3 million approved. The total value of approved works is $10.1 million.

The government has also allocated $2 million in the Budget to advance the delivery of renewable energy to remote communities across the Territory.
Renewables, including solar PV systems, batteries and green hydrogen are set to replace diesel generators in 72 communities, building on the $6.6 million Renewable Remote Power Program and the $59 million Solar Energy Transformation Program that has already delivered 10 MW of solar generation to remote communities in the Territory.
The government said it will spend $2 million over the next two years securing land access near communities, assessing future power demand, and surveying transmission lines and other infrastructure already on-site.
“This is the preparatory work so that’s about talking to the land councils and other relevant parties,” Gunner said.
Energy companies are expected to invest about $400 million in the Territory to roll out and operate the renewable energy systems.
“Attracting private sector investment at this scale will establish the Territory as a leader in remote micro-grids technologies,” Gunner said.
The program is expected to be completed by 2030.
The NT government is aiming to deliver 50% of the Territory’s power using renewables by the end of the decade. Once converted from diesel to renewables, the communities will contribute 5% towards the target.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government will hand down its 2021-22 Budget on Tuesday and the energy sector will be  hoping that spending decisions announced earlier this week are signs of good things to come.
On Monday the government announced it would provide $80 million for the construction of a gas-fired power station in New South Wales as part of the “gas-led recovery”. That was followed by the  announcement that three commercial-scale hydrogen projects would receive $103 million in funding from the government’s Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/06/new-england-solar-says-end-in-sight-for-australian-asset-sale/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 6, 2021",New England Solar says end in sight for Australian asset sale,"ASX-listed solar energy investor New Energy Solar this week told shareholders the sale process for the Beryl and Manildra solar power plants remains on track with an announcement of an outcome expected before the end of June.
“The asset sale process for NEW’s Australian assets, Beryl (110.9 MWdc) and Manildra (55.9 MWdc), is progressing well,” the company said in its March quarterly update.
“The indicative bid phase is complete and select parties are engaged in intensive due diligence and site visits. The process remains on schedule with completion anticipated by mid 2021.”
The sale has attracted interest from a range of investors, both domestic and international, with the Australian Financial Review reporting the shortlist includes Sydney’s Palisade Investment Partners (which recently acquired Granville Harbour Wind Farm in Tasmania), and Thailand’s Banpu which is advised by the Azure/Natixis partnership.
Melbourne-based Lighthouse Infrastructure, which has interests in Queensland’s Emerald Solar Park and Clare Solar Farm, and a rooftop PV portfolio is also listed among the contenders.
New Energy Solar, which is also active in the United States market with solar farms totalling more than 600 MWdc, flagged the sale of its Australian portfolio late last year after reporting a $74.3 million loss in 2020.
A strategic review conducted by RBC Capital Markets recommended the company’s exit from the Australian renewable energy market, having identified that New Energy Solar’s security price has been impeded in part by “limited support for the listed renewables sector in Australia”.
New Energy Solar CEO John Martin said at the time the US has a market that offers more favourable regulatory and market settings for renewable energy.
“We had hoped to build NEW’s Australian portfolio but acquiring quality assets with long-term PPAs is more difficult in Australia. We concluded that we would not be able to achieve a business of scale here.”
New Energy Solar told shareholders this week the policy and regulatory environment for renewables in Australia had again played a part as its portfolio had performed below the investment manager’s expectations in Q1 2021.
While the company said the performance was primarily due to fire damage at its Stanford Solar Plant in California, it said grid curtailment in NSW had also played a part.
New Energy Solar said that subject to completion, proceeds from the asset sale will be available for a range of capital management initiatives, which may include security buybacks, capital returns and debt reduction.
“Assuming the Australian asset sale concludes as expected, the boards intend to undertake capital management initiatives to restore value for investors,” the company said, adding the nature and size of the capital management initiatives will not be known until the sale process is complete.

With Indian policymakers pushing to establish a domestic solar manufacturing industry, it has emerged the country will provide $131 million of soft loans for the government of Bangladesh to develop a 100 MW solar park.
The 325-acre solar project, to be built on a mainly government-owned khas (fallow) site leased from the Ministry of Land, will take shape with the help of at least 75% of Indian goods and services, under the terms of the sponsor nation’s foreign credit rules.
Dhaka will directly provide $40 million for the project, with the state-owned Rural Power Company Ltd supplying a further $5.9 million. The solar farm, near the Jamuna river in Bangladesh’s northeastern Jamalpur district, is expected to come online by December 2023 and the authorities are already planning a second 100 MW solar project nearby, with an unnamed Chinese company.
The solar park will provide power to the nearby Mymensingh and Dhaka districts, according to Rural Power Company MD Abdus Sabur.
The Bangladesh Planning Commission has directed a dam planned to surround the renewables project be planted with trees.
Rural Power Company’s Sabur said he hoped development could start soon, provided the plan is approved by the executive committee of the National Economic Council, the highest decision making body in Bangladesh.
The Indian-financed solar park was originally planned for the Bagerhat district in the southwest of Bangladesh but was moved on ecological grounds because bodies of water on that site would have had to be landfilled to make way for the panels.
Dhaka is cranking up its renewable energy efforts after falling far short of its ambition to draw 10% of its electricity from renewables by last year. With around 730 MW of clean energy generation capacity, renewables made up around 3% of the energy mix in 2020.
The nation’s latest five-year plan, which runs until 2025, features “aggressive efforts” to support renewables development and work is under way to update a decade-old national clean energy policy.

The project has the support of the Commonwealth Government’s Council on Australia Latin America Relations (COALAR) grant, and will produce a hydrogen dairy industry feasibility study, global webinar and key message campaign in coordination with Deakin’s Latin American office in Montevideo along with Food and Fibre Great South Coast. 
Milking it
According to a 2015 study from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the dairy industry’s emissions exceeded 1,700 million tonnes of CO2 or equivalent (methane, nitrous oxides) in 2015, a figure comparable to the emissions of the aviation and shipping sectors combined. 

Of course, in recent decades the diary industry has expanded massively to meet increasing demand, and in that time has increased its energy efficiency, but nevertheless, the dairy industry needs to clean up, and perhaps clean hydrogen is a way to do it. Though it should be said that Hycel has not specified that the hydrogen opportunities are strictly green. 
Hydrogen Dairy Project
Food and Fibre Great South Coast’s executive officer, Natalie Collard, said that this project focuses on laying the foundations to understand hydrogen’s broad application for dairy industries so that the region can capitalise on a market estimated to be worth US $2.5 trillion by 2050.
“Hydrogen is an emerging market with enormous potential,” continued Collard, “and mapping the opportunities for key industries such as dairy in these early stages means that our south west Victorian region can be at the forefront of innovation.”
Deakin’s vice-chancellor Iain Martin agrees, saying: “Hycel’s new project aptly demonstrates how we are pursuing this goal (lasting value to communities and industry), connecting dairy industries in south west Victoria and Uruguay to explore hydrogen opportunities that have positive economic and environmental impacts.”
The Establishment phase of the Hycel Technology Hub has $2 million in Commonwealth funding to develop a facility for the development of hydrogen technologies at scale.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/06/a-different-angle-on-perovskite-defects/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"MAY 6, 2021",A different angle on perovskite defects,"From pv magazine Global
While scientists have quickly pushed the efficiency of perovskite solar cells to levels that rival or even surpass some of today’s commercial technologies, gaining a full understanding of all the mechanisms at work within the material will be a much longer process.
The role of defects in perovskite material structures is currently one of the most studied areas here. Such defects are thought to be the main limiting factors in both performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. And while different types of passivation – where a coating is applied to limit the activity of defects – have been used successfully, the mechanisms by which these defects affect solar cell performance are not fully understood, and a closer look at them could open up even more effective strategies.
Taking such a closer look was the goal of a group of scientists led by China’s Peking University, who investigated a method using additives to control the perovskite’s dielectric properties, and demonstrate the creation of a screening effect that limits the influence of defects on solar cell performance. “Such an effect lowers the possibility that carriers are trapped in defects, thus, even if the defects still exist, they are, to some extent, “invisible” to charge carriers…,” the group explained. “Based on these improvements, nonradiative recombination pathways can be considerably suppressed.”
Working with an inverted perovskite solar cell device made from formamidinium-cesium lead halide, the group used this approach to fabricate a 22.3% efficient solar cell with 1.25 V open-circuit voltage, and also provide new insights into where voltage losses occur between the perovskite film and the PV device. The work is described in full in the paper Dielectric screening in perovskite photovoltaics, published in Nature Communications.
“The accelerated dielectric response of the film not only greatly improves the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite but also boosts the power conversion efficiency…” the group explained. “…further quantitative analysis in the voltage loss provides a clear understanding of the different origins of nonradiative losses and corresponding contributions.”
With these insights into how various particles interact with each other deep within a perovskite material, the group expects to unlock several new pathways for researchers to bring perovskite solar cells even closer to their theoretical efficiency limits. “This work provides a new paradigm to mitigate the adverse effect of defects from different angles,” they conclude, “which will open a new avenue to further minimise nonradiative recombination losses in perovskite photovoltaics by dielectric regulation.”
