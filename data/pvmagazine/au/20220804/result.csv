The Maryvale Solar and Energy Storage project, being developed on a 360-hectare site near Wellington about 37 kilometres southeast of Dubbo, builds upon the original proposal for a 125 MW solar farm. The expanded project will comprise approximately 235 MWp of solar PV capacity “DC-coupled” with 190-270 MWh of energy storage.
Wirsol, which late last year acquired a majority stake in the original project from Netherlands-based renewables developer Photon Energy, said the approval brings it a step closer to building what it described as “a market-first hybrid solar and energy storage plant”.
The company said the DC-coupling of solar generation and energy storage involves connecting both elements directly into the inverters at the site, allowing it to function as a predictable and dispatchable generation asset.
“This means that solar or grid energy can be efficiently stored for later use when the market requires it,” Wirsol said in a statement. “It also allows what is known as ‘clipped’ energy to be stored, thereby increasing the effective production of the photovoltaic components compared to a traditional solar plant.”

The company said the flexibility afforded by combining renewable energy generation and storage is far better suited to meeting the needs of Australia’s electricity market.
“The pairing means that the plant’s output into the grid is fully controllable, ensuring stability of supply whilst allowing it to bid into markets previously unavailable to variable renewable energy plants,” Wirsol said.
Construction of the project is expected to begin in 2023 with commercial operations to commence in early 2025. Once completed, the project will generate enough clean energy to power the equivalent of approximately 82,000 homes each year.
The project, located in the state’s Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone which will deliver at least 3 GW of renewable energy into the grid, is the latest for Wirsol which has established a strong presence in the Australian market since its entry in 2017.

The bill passed in the lower house 89 votes to 55.
The Labor government’s proposal would enshrine in law a 43% emissions reduction target by 2030 based on 2005 levels, which underpins Labor’s policy to secure Australia’s energy transition from its reliance on fossil fuels.
It also includes increased accountability with the climate change minister to provide an annual update to parliament on the progress being made towards achieving the target. There will also be greater transparency and strengthened requirements on the Climate Change Authority, the body charged with advising on climate targets and policies.
Labor’s legislation also formalises its climate change agenda taken to the election which includes a commitment to ensure Australia’s energy grid is comprised of 82% renewables by 2030.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday that legislating the emissions reduction target would provide much-needed certainty to the business community and industry around investment in renewable energy and usher in the next generation of economic growth and opportunity.
“This bill records the government’s ambition to take the country forward on climate action,” he said. “It will help open the way for new jobs, new industries, new technologies and a new era of prosperity for Australian manufacturing.”
Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said he “hopes and expects” that Australia will go above its 43% target, and the legislation made it clear it was a “floor, not a ceiling”.
“I want to thank all members of the House of Representatives that voted in favour of the legislation and their constructive contributions in its formation,” he said. “The passing of this bill in the House of Representatives starts a new era of climate and energy certainty, one that is well overdue.
“Renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy, renewable energy is the key to reducing emissions and seizing the jobs opportunity that is the climate emergency.”
The bill will now proceed to the Senate to be debated in upcoming sitting weeks. The government needs the Greens plus one crossbencher to get any contested legislation through the Senate.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/04/kidston-solar-farm-retains-place-atop-large-scale-performance-rankings/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 4, 2022",Kidston Solar Farm retains place atop large-scale performance rankings,"The Kidston Solar Farm has been declared Australia’s best performing utility PV asset for the fourth consecutive month with the latest data from consultancy firm Rystad Energy revealing that the nation’s top 10 solar farms in terms of capacity factor in the month of July are all located in Queensland.
The clear leader, for the fourth month in a row, was the 50 MW Kidston Solar Farm with senior Rystad analyst David Dixon noting the far north Queensland facility had delivered an average AC capacity factor (CF) of 25.5% for the month.
The announcement comes after Genex on Monday turned down a takeover bid from a consortium comprising Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquhar’s private investment fund Skip Capital, and US equity firm Stonepeak Partners.
The company’s board said that after careful consideration of the proposal it had unanimously concluded the offer undervalued Genex. It did however say it is willing to “engage constructively” with the consortium to explore whether it can submit a revised proposal that is capable of being recommended to Genex shareholders.
The Kidston Solar Farm, which Genex has been operating since 2017, is part of the planned Kidston Clean Energy Hub, which is to include a 250 MW/2 GWh pumped hydro energy storage facility while up to 270 MW of additional solar and up to 150 MW of wind generation have also been proposed.
Queensland solar assets dominated large-scale PV generation for July with the best performing solar farms in Australia all located in the state. The Kidston Solar Farm was followed by Pacific Hydro Australia’s 100 MW Haughton stage 1 solar farm, at a capacity factor of 24.7%, and Adani Australia’s 65 MW Rugby Run Solar Farm, with 24.4% AC CF.

Dixon said the top three remained the same as last month while Queensland assets had filled out the top 10 with the Gunnedah and Nyngan solar farms in regional New South Wales the only assets from outside of the Sunshine State to feature in the top 15.
The 110 MW Gunnedah Solar Farm, recently acquired by CalEnergy Resources, an offshoot of United States renewable energy giant Berkshire Hathaway Energy. was ranked 11th while Tilt Renewables’ 102 MW Nyngan Solar Farm was ranked 14th.
Utility scale PV generation for the month increased 44% year on year to a total of 767 GWh, up from 532 GWh in July 2021.
The bulk of the large-scale solar PV power for the month was generated in Queensland and NSW, which were evenly matched on capacity energised (just over 2.5 GW each) and generation (~300 GWh/month each).
Dixon said Australian utility PV and wind assets had generated a combined total of 3441 GWh for the month, up 4% from 3320 GWh this time last year.
Wind generation declined from 2,788 GWh in July 2021 to 2,673 GWh this year with the Kiata Wind Farm (51.5% CF) in Victoria the best-performing utility wind asset for the month, followed by the Biala (50.8% CF) and Cullerin Range wind farms (45.5% CF) in NSW.
At a state level, NSW surpassed 600 GWh of wind generation for the first time, benefitting from the ramp up of the Bango Wind Farm. Victoria continues to be the market leader for wind with more than 4 GW energised, with SA and NSW a distant second and third.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/04/the-greens-have-backed-labors-43-target-but-dont-think-australias-climate-wars-are-over/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"AUGUST 4, 2022",The Greens have backed Labor’s 43% target – but don’t think Australia’s climate wars are over,"The good news: the nation will soon have a substantive target for emissions reduction, after the Greens agreed to back the Labor government’s reduction of 43% by 2030.
The slightly less good news: the Coalition isn’t playing ball on climate. And as far as the Greens are concerned, the climate wars aren’t over at all.
That’s because the Greens – who now hold the balance of power in the Senate – see Labor as the largest remaining obstacle to climate action that aligns with the goals of the Paris Agreement. That goal: keep global warming under 1.5℃.
As Bandt told the National Press Club on Wednesday, Labor’s refusal to stop new coal and gas projects was “untenable” and the Greens will “pull every lever at our disposal” to force a ban. Expect to see the Greens causing headaches for Labor by making good on this promise. Bandt’s rhetoric yesterday made that clear:
“We will continue to fight individual projects around the country … I call on all Australians to join this battle. This battle to save our country, our communities and indeed our whole civilisation from the climate and environment crisis.”
So why did the Greens agree to back Labor’s climate change bill when the party wanted more? The reasons lie in recent political history.
The Greens copped huge criticism for blocking Labor’s last lukewarm climate policy, the Rudd government’s carbon pollution reduction scheme.
The Greens argued the scheme was full of holes. The Coalition also blocked the measure as part of its entrenched opposition to climate action. But rightly or wrongly, many see the Greens’ move as a strategic error that set climate action back by a decade.
For the record, the Greens – like the teal independents – are hardly being radical in pushing for stronger emissions targets. What the Greens want is a 75% emission reduction target by 2030, and no more new coal and gas projects.
The party believes it has a mandate, given 16 Greens were elected to parliament in May, up from 10 at the 2019 election. That’s not to mention the sudden appearance of the teals, who cut a swathe through the ranks of the climate-recalcitrant Coalition.
Whilst the Greens have publicly taken the fight to Labor over the emissions target, both Greens and teals have been negotiating with the government to ramp up the climate bill’s ambition.
Indeed it was independent Senator David Pocock who first suggested Labor’s target should be a “floor, not a ceiling and then ramping up ambition over time”.
Like the Greens, the teals have never seen this climate bill as job done. They, too, see it as just the beginning of the great decarbonising effort ahead. The Greens can ill-afford to cede them any credit for amending the bill.
That’s what lies behind the pragmatic declaration of support for the bill by Greens leader Adam Bandt in his National Press Club address on Wednesday.

The Dutton-led opposition will not support the bill and, rather unhelpfully, has indicated it will push to expand Australia’s nuclear industry instead. But the Greens backing of the bill means the Coalition’s position is irrelevant for now.
Bandt’s address made clear the Greens see themselves taking electoral ground from Labor at the next election by pursuing climate change and social welfare policy gains.
Indeed, Bandt poured scorn on the economic liberalism embraced by Labor since the days of Hawke and Keating, saying it damaged the environment and delivered massive social inequality.
As Bandt said on Wednesday, supporting the climate bill is only stage one. The Greens are bullish about what’s next, claiming a mandate from the planet and the laws of physics.
To give Labor credit where it’s due, stage one is still significant. This bill legitimates climate action and gives renewable investors confidence that the government actually wants change.
For their part, the teals believe the devil will be in the policy details. The Greens, too, will be keenly awaiting that.
So how will Labor respond? We can sense that already. Even before Bandt had finished speaking, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was batting away any Greens tinkering with the government’s soon to be revamped safeguard mechanism.
The government has also poured cold water on the Greens’ proposed climate trigger, which would more rigorously assess major projects for climate and environment impacts.

The Greens are treading a fine line. They want to push climate ambition upwards. But they must avoid repeating recent history.
This time around, it would be unthinkable for the Greens to sit with the Coalition in opposing climate action. It would cost them dearly in upcoming state elections, and probably cost them seats at the next election.
But the Greens still want to end Australia’s fossil fuel expansionism, and are prepared to take on the might of the fossil fuel industry. We’ve had the climate bill skirmish. But the battle is only just beginning.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/04/world-to-install-250-gw-of-solar-this-year-says-bloomberg-analyst/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 4, 2022",World to install 250 GW of solar this year says Bloomberg analyst,"Demand is pushing solar growth across the world to new heights with Bloomberg senior analyst Rob Barnett forecasting deployment to increase by 30% this year. Total global solar deployment is closing in on 1 TW installed – an impressive milestone for the energy transition.
“The global solar picture is just staggering at this point,” Barnett told Yahoo Finance. “We are on track to install something like 250 GW of solar capacity this year.”
China is contributing the largest share to capacity growth this year, with about 108 GW of new operational PV. This is a near-doubling of the roughly 55 GW installed by China last year. The country has the world’s largest exposure to renewable energy, with 323 GW of solar and 338 GW of wind energy. President Xi Jinping aims for 1,200 GW combined by 2030, and the nation is currently ahead of schedule on that goal, said Bloomberg.
Renewable energy is hitting all-time highs in Australia, too. The Australian Energy Market Operator’s latest Quarterly Energy Dynamics report shows overall renewable supply share for the June quarter was 31.8%. And Barnett said the solar boom has just begun.
“There really is this big, top-line growth scenario that we see unfolding for all of the companies that are participating in the solar supply chain,” said Barnett.
Climate goals are one driver of the red-hot demand for solar, but Barnett said there is another force that is accelerating demand in the near-term.
“I would actually argue that the bigger driver for clean energy demand, particularly here in Europe, is elevated energy costs,” he said.
Costs continue to fall for PV, making it increasingly cost-competitive with oil, which has spiked in price since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Shipments of solar modules have fallen precipitously over 20 years, from $4.88/W in 2000 to $0.34/W in 2021, based on a recent report by the Energy Information Administration.
Barnett said he expects solar demand to retain its momentum, even if oil and natural gas prices cool off.
“It’s certainly possible that if you had some easing in the traditional fuel markets, that it might take the accelerator off, but I don’t really see that as being a material risk on the demand side of the equation for clean energy,” he said.
This demand-side momentum is likely to continue as prices improve and the global economy targets decarbonization.
“I do think that the economics are already quite good. And so you’d have to see such a sea change in terms of gas prices or coal prices, if you’re thinking about the power grid, to really reverse some of the trends. And I just don’t think there’s any appetite for it either,” said Barnett.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/04/malaysia-energy-major-targets-early-closure-of-coal-plants/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,MALAYSIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 4, 2022",Malaysia energy major targets early closure of coal plants,"Malaysia utilities giant Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) announced this week it is aiming to install more than 14 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2050 as it seeks to retire some of its coal-fired assets earlier than planned as part of ongoing efforts to achieve emissions reduction targets and ensure continued business growth for the company.
TNB, which supplies electricity across the Malaysian Peninsula and also has investments in coal power infrastructure in India, has committed to a 35% reduction in carbon emissions intensity and a 50% reduction of its coal generation capacity by 2035 as it targets net zero emissions by 2050.
The state-owned utility said it would explore the viability of retiring its coal-fired assets earlier than originally planned and also wants to re-fuel existing power infrastructure with hydrogen as it looks to position its generation arm, GenCo, as a greener and more sustainable player in the power generation sector.
“TNB is very much in the driver’s seat when it comes to delivering the nation’s energy transition,” TNB president and chief executive officer Datuk Baharin Din said.
TNB said it will start by closing the 1.4 GW Kapar Energy Ventures coal plant in the nation’s west in 2028-2029, a year before the expiration of its power purchase agreement (PPA). The plan is still pending approval from shareholders and the government.
“We hope to start with Kapar Energy Ventures and are exploring the viability of retiring the 1,400 MW plant up to a year ahead of its PPA expiration subject to shareholders’ agreement and approvals from the relevant authorities and regulators,” Baharin said.
“As for repowering plants with new technology, we have recently received a Letter of Intent to allow the repowering of our 1,400 MW gas-powered plant in Paka, which we intend to make hydrogen-ready by 2029.”
TNB did not say how many coal plants in total it plans to close early. Malaysia currently has eight coal-fired power plants which can generate 12 GW of electricity. Last year, the country announced plans to cut more than 4 GW of coal power capacity by 2039. Coal is the dominant fuel in Malaysia’s energy mix, producing 43% of the country’s power in 2019.
TNB said it is also “actively seeking” to build strategic alliances with technology partners as it plans to expand its solar, wind, green hydrogen and energy storage portfolio across Asia Pacific and Europe. It is aiming to install 14 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2050, up from about 3.5 GW today.
“As demand for clean energy increases with the energy transition, we project the value of the clean energy market to be an estimated RM65 billion (AU$21 billion) to RM80 billion (AU$25.85 billion), and we intend to capture a significant share of the market,” Baharin said.
TNB also plans to capture a significant slice of the electric vehicle market, announcing it will invest RM90 million (AU$29 million) over three years to promote the uptake of EVs. The company expects the investment will help deliver 500,000 EVs on Malaysian roads by 2030 which it said translates to approximately 2.3 TWh of electricity charging requirements, valued at almost RM1.26 billion (AU$$41 million).
“The potential positive impact to both climate and the company’s bottom-line makes the development of the EV ecosystem a clear priority for TNB,” Baharin said.

Researchers from the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology have designed a rechargeable silicon (Si) battery for stationary storage applications that can be reversibly discharged at 1.1 V and charged at 1.5 V.
The device combines a reversible Si anode with halide cathodes and uses hybrid electrolytes to enable cell recharging. In the proposed system configuration, silicon is dissolved during the battery discharge process, and upon charging, elemental Si is deposited. The hybrid electrolytes, which were tailored with halides such as bromine and iodine, reversibly support the Si electro-dissolution and electrodeposition processes in the same cell formation.
“During the discharge process, Si electrodissolution occurs at the anode and, dissolved halides are reduced at the cathode,” the scientists said. “The charging process entails Si species electrodeposition and halide oxidation.”
They assembled all cell components in an Ar-filled glovebox and prepared the silicon electrodes from n-type 4′′ silicon wafers. They also left the cells to rest for three hours to detect possible leakage and used platinum foils as counter electrodes.
After several cycles, the battery achieved a coulombic efficiency of approximately 80%, while showing gradual cell degradation. The cell showed limited power capabilities of 0.1 mA cm–2,” the scientists said. “The presence of appreciable fluoride species is crucial in both establishing surface activation and battery operation, and their depletion is directly linked to cell performance degradation.”
The academics presented the novel battery concept in “Rechargeable Silicon Redox Batteries,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials.
“The feasibility of the new design paves the way for higher specific energy devices aiming towards the segments of low power applications. These findings undoubtedly warrant further investigation and electrolyte optimisation,” they said.

Toshiba Energy Systems and Solutions Corp. (Toshiba EES), a unit of Japanese conglomerate Toshiba, has energised a refuelling station for hydrogen vehicles in Niigata, the capital of Niigata Prefecture located in the Chūbu region of Japan.
The H2One ST Unit, which the company has already deployed across several locations in Japan, is powered by a 20 kW photovoltaic array located nearby and is intended to power fuel cell buses.
According to the company, the system is able to refill about eight hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, each in three minutes. It is also able to supply both hydrogen fuel to fuel cell vehicles and electric power by using hydrogen produced with renewable energy within the station. The hydrogen generated may also be transported in trailers and hydrogen bundles to users elsewhere in the prefecture as well as in other regions.
According to the company, that kind of installation can be deployed easily and operated by customers such as factories, harbours, airports and bus depots.
Toshiba’s energy system and solutions business began a demonstration of a holistic hydrogen supply chain for electricity generation in May 2018.
