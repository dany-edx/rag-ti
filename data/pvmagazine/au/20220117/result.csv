Australia Project is progressing its plan to build the 12 MW Sandy Creek Solar Farm near the small town of Uranquinty in the Riverina region of New South Wales (NSW) after the Southern Regional Planning Panel (SRPP) provided unanimous support for the proposed project.
The 12 MW (17 MWdc) solar farm, to be developed on a 42-hectare site to the north of Uranquinty, about 16 kilometres from Wagga Wagga, will comprise approximately 40,000 solar PV modules mounted on single axis trackers, four containerised power stations and associated infrastructure. Connection to the mains grid will be via an existing 22 kV powerline through a proposed new switching station.
BayWa said the Sandy Creek Solar Farm will generate approximately 32,000 MWh of renewable electricity per year, enough to service the equivalent of about 7,500 households. Construction time for the project has been estimated at nine months.
The Development Application for the project was submitted to Wagga Wagga City Council and approved by the SRPP last month. The SRPP said its decision to provide planning approval was unanimous with BayWa stating the project has been deemed “regionally significant” by the local and state government authorities.
BayWa r.e. Projects Australia managing director Fleur Yaxley welcomed the development’s approval saying the site’s close proximity to the electrical grid and the area’s high solar irradiance makes it “ideal”.
“This is just one of those special projects showcasing renewable energy,” she said.
“It shows us how comfortably community can be connected with construction and generation while reducing carbon emissions and the negative effects of climate change.”

The Sandy Creek Solar Farm is on the boundary of the proposed South-West Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), one of five designated clean energy areas detailed in the NSW government’s electricity roadmap, which is expected to support more than $32 billion of investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission in the state.
The project site is also within close proximity to Project EnergyConnect, a new $2.3 billion electricity interconnector being built by Transgrid and ElectraNet between Wagga Wagga and Robertstown in South Australia.
Project EnergyConnect will also deliver an upgrade for the transmission line between Wagga Wagga and Dinawan, which links to the eastern edge of the REZ, and is expected to unlock up to 1.2 GW of additional transmission capacity.
The planning approval of the Sandy Creek Solar Farm, which BayWa acquired when it purchased the assets and project development pipeline of Future Energy in 2017, follows the approval earlier last year of the developer’s 26 MW Yarren Hut Solar Farm to be built near Nyngan, in central NSW.
BayWa’s 300 MW Wimmera Plains Energy Facility near Horsham in Victoria’s west was also given the go ahead in 2021.
BayWa has identified Australia as a key market and since its arrival in 2017 has delivered seven utility scale wind and solar assets, including the 112 MW Karadoc and the 106 MW Yatpool solar farms near Mildura in Victoria.

GEV said Darwin-based EcOz Environmental Services has been engaged to prepare the project’s environmental referral submission for lodgement with the Northern Territory Environment Protection Authority in the first half of 2022.
GEV executive director and chief development officer Garry Triglavcanin said the referral submission is an important step forward as the environmental process is likely to drive the project schedule.
“There are a number of key environmental studies that can only be conducted during the current wet season,” he said in a statement.
GEV has also engaged consulting firms ILF and Jacobs to prepare engineering studies supporting the referral submission, covering the key areas of solar generation, power transmission, including the transmission line route, as well as water desalination to supply water to the electrolysis plant.
The engagement of ILF follows GEV’s previously announced memorandum of understanding with the company in Germany.
GEV first unveiled plans to develop the 2.8 GW green hydrogen export project on the Tiwi Islands in October.
The project is proposing to deliver a fully integrated green hydrogen production and export supply chain, starting with a fleet of the company’s 430-tonne compressed hydrogen ships, with a view to export up to 100,000 tonnes of renewable hydrogen per annum into the Asia Pacific region.
The project seeks to vertically integrate GEV’s hydrogen business, which has largely focussed on designing and making ships to both run on and carry compressed hydrogen.

Development of the Tiwi Island project is being planned as a phased approach with the initial stage to see a 500 MW solar farm built on the island, which would expand to 2.8 GW as the regional hydrogen market grows and costs of solar, electrolysers and shipping reduce.
In November, the company announced it had raised $12 million through a share placement to accelerate development of the project.
In a statement last week GEV confirmed its 2022 development program is fully funded following the capital raising.
GEV said the environmental referral submission is expected to provide sufficient information to the NT EPA to enable a decision on the level of assessment required for the project.
The company is anticipating lodging its submission in the first half of 2022.
GEV expects to make appointments during the March and June quarters in relation to the detailed engineering of the solar generation and electrolysis process.
The solar facility is expected to be constructed on existing plantation land while the hydrogen production, compression and loading facilities are set to be built on existing industrial precinct and existing port area.
The company is targeting financial close of the project’s initial phase by mid-2023.
Potential offtake targets in the Singapore, Japan, Korea and Indonesian markets are also being identified.

Lithium-oxygen, or lithium-air batteries (LABs), are one of many pathways to improving today’s energy storage technologies. Lithium and other metal-air batteries are favoured in research for their potential for high energy densities, but low efficiency and poor cycle lifetimes have proven to be tough obstacles to overcome in developing such technologies.
With this in mind, scientists from Japan’s National Institute for Materials Science and Softbank have developed a rechargeable lithium-air battery. They claim it has an energy density that greatly exceeds that of conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Like other LABs built at the research level, the Japanese consortium’s battery relies on lithium for the negative electrode and oxygen for the positive porous carbon electrode. The 10-cell stacked device has a size of 4 cm x 5 cm and single-layered cells with a 2 cm x 2 cm electrode.
“In the stacked cell configuration, oxygen needs to be transported in the horizontal direction in the gas diffusion layer,” the scientists explained. “Then, oxygen needs to be further transported to the vertical direction to go through the whole part of the positive electrode.”
When operated at room temperature, the champion battery exhibited a weight energy density of 500 Wh/kg, which is about twice that of current lithium-ion batteries. The performance has been described as the highest in the world in terms of energy density and number of cycles.
“Although there are many reports that demonstrate the successful operation of a LAB with prolonged discharge/charge processes for more than 100 cycles, their energy density at the practical cell level was lower than 50 W h kg−1. In contrast, for the LABs with an energy density over 300 W h kg−1, the cycle number was less than 20 cycles,” the researchers said.
They claim that the storage device has potential applications in residential power storage systems, electric vehicles, drones, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. They described it in “Criteria for evaluating lithium-air batteries in academia to correctly predict their practical performance in industry,” which was recently published in Materials Horizons.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/17/green-hydrogen-is-coming-and-these-australian-regions-are-well-placed-to-build-our-new-export-industry/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JANUARY 17, 2022",Green hydrogen is coming – and these Australian regions are well placed to build our new export industry,"You might remember hearing a lot about green hydrogen last year, as global pressure mounted on Australia to take stronger action on climate change ahead of the COP26 Glasgow summit last November.
The government predicts green hydrogen exports and domestic use could be worth up to $50 billion within 30 years, helping the world achieve deep decarbonisation.
But how close are we really to a green hydrogen industry? And which states are best placed to host it? My research shows that as of next year, and based on where the cheapest renewables are, the best places to produce green hydrogen are far north Queensland and Tasmania.
As ever more renewable energy pours into our grid, this picture will change. By the end of the decade, the north Queensland coast could become the hydrogen powerhouse. By 2040, dirt-cheap solar should make inland areas across New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia the lowest cost producers.
Why is there so much buzz around green hydrogen? In short, because it offers us a zero emissions way to transport energy. Take cheap renewable energy and use it to split water into hydrogen and oxygen using an electrolyser. Store the hydrogen on trucks, ship it overseas, or send it by pipeline. Then use the hydrogen for transport, manufacturing or electricity production.

All the technology exists – it’s the cost holding the industry back at present. That’s where Australia and its wealth of cheap renewable energy comes in.
Making hydrogen is nothing new – it has a long history of use in fertiliser production and oil refining. But until now, the main source for hydrogen was gas, a fossil fuel.
In the last few years, however, there has been a sudden surge of interest and investment in green hydrogen, and new technology pathways have emerged to produce cheap green hydrogen. As global decarbonisation gathers steam, Japan, South Korea and parts of Europe are looking for clean alternatives to replace the role fossil fuels have played in their economies.
Australia is exceptionally well placed to deliver these alternatives, with world-beating renewable resources and ports set up for our existing fossil fuel exports, such as coal and LNG.
In 2019, we sold almost $64 billion of black coal, with most going to Japan, South Korea, India and China. As these countries decarbonise, the coal industry will shrink. Green hydrogen could be an excellent replacement.
At present, Australia is a long way from producing green hydrogen cheap enough to compete with fossil fuels, given we seem to have no appetite for taxing carbon pollution.
Does that mean it’s a non-starter? Hardly. It was only a decade ago sceptics ridiculed solar and wind as too expensive. They’ve gone awfully quiet as renewable prices fell, and fell, and fell – as tracked by the International Renewable Energy Agency. Now renewables are cheaper than coal. Battery storage, too, has fallen drastically in price. The same forces are at work on the key technology we need – cheaper electrolysers.
By 2040, the CSIRO predicts an 83% fall in electrolyser costs, according to its Gencost 2021-22 report. By contrast, gas-derived hydrogen with carbon capture is predicted to reduce in cost only slightly. That means green hydrogen is likely to capture much of the market for hydrogen from 2030 onwards.
My research with the Victorian Hydrogen Hub shows as of next year, the lowest cost location for green hydrogen would be Far North Queensland ($4.1/kg) and Tasmania ($4.4/kg) due to high renewable resources.
But this picture will change. By 2030, northern Queensland’s coastal regions could be the Australian hydrogen powerhouse due to a combination of cheap solar and access to ports. Western Australia and the Northern Territory could also have similar advantages, though the modelling for these areas has not yet been done.
As solar energy and electrolyser costs continue to fall, new states could enter the green hydrogen economy. In CSIRO’s cost predictions, electricity from solar is predicted to become much cheaper than wind by 2040. This means sunny areas like central and northern Queensland ($1.7/kg) and inland NSW, Victoria and South Australia ($1.8/kg) could be the best locations for green hydrogen production.
In making these estimates, I do not consider supply chain and storage infrastructure required to deliver the hydrogen. Transport could account for between $0.05/kg to $0.75/kg depending on distance.
Comparing my modelling to price thresholds set out in the National Hydrogen Strategy indicates we can produce green hydrogen for trucking at a similar cost to diesel within four years. Fertiliser would take longer, becoming competitive by 2040.

If we achieved the $50 billion green hydrogen industry the government is aiming for, how much water would it consume? Surprisingly little. It would take only around 4% of the water we used for our crops and pastures in 2019-20 to generate an export industry that size – 225,000 megalitres.
Much more water than this will be freed up as coal-fired power stations exit the grid. In Queensland and NSW alone, these power stations consume around 158,000 megalitres a year according to a 2020 report prepared for the Australian Conservation Foundation. Coal mining in these two states takes an additional 224,000 megalitres.
 
As the cost of renewable energy falls and falls, we will also be able to desalinate seawater along our coasts to produce hydrogen. We estimate this would account for only about 1% of the cost of producing hydrogen, based on Australian Water Association desalination cost estimates.
This decade, we must plan for our new hydrogen economy. Government and industry will need to develop and support new hydrogen infrastructure projects to produce, distribute, use and export hydrogen at scale.
We’re already seeing promising signs of progress, as major mining companies move strongly into green hydrogen.
Now we need governments across Australia to rapidly get optimal policy and regulations in place to allow the industry to develop and thrive.

Chinese micro-inverter maker Hoymiles Power Electronics Inc. has recently unveiled a new product for high-power modules. “The HMS-2000 micro-inverter is being produced at our factory in Hangzhou,” a company’s spokesperson told pv magazine. “It is currently being solar in all markets.”
The device can be connected with four modules in an approach that the manufacturer defines as “4-in-1,” which enables the deployment of a larger number of solar panels by reducing the number of microinverters used. These devices differ from string inverters, as they have four independent connections and the output of each panel is tracked and converted individually.
“The 4-in-1 design enables 4 MPPTs in a single microinverter, thus saving 40-50% of the costs compared with similar solutions,” the spokesperson went on to say. “The module-level monitoring also makes it super easy to check power generation status and simplifies maintenance.”
The micro-inverter measures 331 × 218 x 34.6 mm and weighs 4.7 kg. Its nominal MPPT efficiency is 99.8% and the California Energy Commission (CEC) efficiency is 96.5%. It also features a maximum output power of up to 2000 VA, which the company said is a new benchmark for the industry.
The new product has a maximum input voltage of 65 V and an MPPT voltage range between 16 and 60 V. It can be used with solar modules ranging in power output from 400 to 625 W.
The inverter also features natural convection cooling, IP67-rated protection, and independent MPPT and monitoring. “Our latest high-powered microinverter solution lowers costs and expands the applicability of microinverters in industrial and commercial scenarios,” the spokesperson stated.
In early December, Hoymiles successfully completed its initial public offering with the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE). The Hangzhou-based company offered 10 million shares at a price of RMB557.8 (US$87.8) per share. The capital raised through this IPO is estimated to be RMB5.58 billion (US$879 million).

Japanese electronics manufacturer Panasonic has launched a new residential heterojunction panel series that is compatible with its Evervolt lithium-ion storage solution for residential solar installations.
The 410W/400W EverVolt H series is made with 66 half-cut cells and features a power output ranging from 400 to 410 W. It also shows a power conversion efficiency of 21.6% to 22.2%.
The panel’s temperature coefficient is -0.26% per degree Celsius and the manufacturer offers a 25-year product guarantee and a 25-year power output guarantee. The panels are said to be able to operate at 92% of their original performance at the end of the guarantee period.
“More homeowners than ever are interested in going solar, so offering a wide array of wattage, size and price options is essential to staying competitive in the market,” said Mukesh Sethi, Director of Solar and Energy Storage at Panasonic Life Solutions Company of America.
Furthermore, the manufacturer has announced enhancements to its new EverVolt 2.0 residential battery. “New features include a gateway system that simplifies installation by consolidating all necessary components at a single control and access point, and a new app for homeowners that provides visibility into the entire energy system, and enables convenient management of both solar and storage,” it explained.
Panasonic unveiled in November a new version of its lithium-ion storage solution for residential solar installations. “The EverVolt 2.0 battery storage system integrates seamlessly with Panasonic solar panels to create the Total Home Solar Energy System, enabling homeowners to generate and store abundant clean energy,” the manufacturer said at the time.
In May, the company had launched an Evervolt module with a power output ranging from 370 to 380 W. A similar product with 360-370 W output had been unveiled in December 2020.
