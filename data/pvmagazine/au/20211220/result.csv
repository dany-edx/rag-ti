Researchers at the University of Wollongong (UOW) on the New South Wales south coast, in collaboration with those from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, and the Australian National Fabrication Facility, made the discovery, led by Professor David Officer and Professor Gordon Wallace.
Edge Functionalised Graphene, as its called, is comprised of nano platelets which, according to the researchers, have excellent potential as a valuable carbon additive for a variety of electrochemical devices.
The team says due to these unique properties, the materials will be useful in energy storage, both for batteries and supercapacitors, as well as in composites for use as sensors, reinforcement materials or non-metallic conductors.
The researchers are now working with private company Sicona Battery Technologies to demonstrate the scale-up of production. Sicona have made binding agreements with the Wollongong university for the acquisition of all its intellectual property related to Edge Functionalised Graphene (EFG).
“Like many materials, finding a way to exploit the extraordinary properties of graphene in useful applications is critically dependent on making the graphene processable,” Professor Officer said.
“With EFG, we have been able to not only create a process that produces a unique graphene that can be used as a powder, dough, paste or dispersion, but a process that we believe is commercially scalable. Our commercial partners Sicona have recognised this.”
Sicona founder and CEO, Christiaan Jordaan, said the new material will enable it to improve its battery materials’ electrical conductivity, and therefore quality. “It’s a simple and highly scalable production process that yields this unique EFG material, we believe it has a bright future in the rapidly growing battery market,” he said. 
Edge Functionalised Graphene was initially discovered back in 2017, but researchers subsequently had to determine what the material “actually is” and then to simplify the manufacturing process, Professor Wallace said.
“Taking amazing discoveries out of the research lab and into industry is a complex process. Often, we do not have common interests nor agree on the best way forward,” he added, somewhat enigmatically. 
The technology is patent pending in 12 international jurisdictions with its proponents saying it will be “further enhanced” under a two-year research and collaboration agreement between Sicona and UOW focused on process scale-up and application of the graphene material in batteries, as well as a thermal conductivity enhancer.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/20/nts-first-publicly-owned-finally-house-granted-access-to-rooftop-solar/,"LEGAL,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,NORTHERN TERRITORY",BELLA PEACOCK,"DECEMBER 20, 2021",NT’s first publicly owned house finally granted access to rooftop solar,"In a country that leads the world in rooftop solar penetration, the first ever publicly owned house in the Northern Territory was granted access to connect its solar panels over the weekend. 
Warumungu Traditional Owner, Norman Jupurrurla Frank has actually had his pv system sitting on his roof since August. He hasn’t been allowed to connect it though because like the almost all remote Indigenous community households, his electricity meter works on a prepaid system, which cuts power as soon as the household’s electricity “credit” runs out.
News of the first rooftop solar connection, which followed a long battle by Frank and community-organisation Original Power, comes just days after the Australian National University (ANU) led a study published in Nature Energy revealing the extent of energy poverty in the Territory’s remote communities. It found almost all, 91%, of remote Indigenous community households in the Territory had their electricity disconnected in financial year 2018-19. 
Three quarters, 74%, of the 3,300 households surveyed across 28 remote communities lost power more than 10 times. These disconnections could last hours or even days and were most likely to occur in “dangerously” hot temperatures, which are becoming evermore frequent on the frontline of Australia’s changing climate. Tennant Creek, where Frank lives in the Territory’s centre, recorded temperatures over 40°C nearly 50 times last year, according to the ABC.
Electricity in remote Indigenous communities generally comes from diesel generators, which are not only polluting, unreliable, but also extremely expensive, with individuals paying up to $100 a week for power – considerably more than it costs in cities and towns. The energy poverty in these communities then compounds economic poverty, while also foreclosing opportunities for these communities to build enterprises which could break the cycle as it means they constantly lose, for instance, telecommunications services and can’t meet basic needs like keep their refrigerators running to store medicine.
“People are still living rough, houses are hot in summer with no insulation and burning like an oven, and in winter they are freezing like a fridge,” Frank said. 
The solar installation on Frank’s household was paid for by Original Power, which is seeking to  include First Nations Australians in the clean energy movement. For the organisation, the installation was part of a case study to identify and overcome regulatory and technical barriers locking Indigenous households out of the benefits of rooftop solar – like the prepaid metering system.
“What we’re trying to do through pilot projects and associated policy reform is to try to get models that can be rolled out among remote communities to achieve that direct equitable benefit to the household,” Original Power’s Coordinator of the Clean Energy Communities Project, Lauren Mellor, told pv magazine Australia.
“That hasn’t been looked at before in the Northern Territory, it’s not really a model that exists in many places in Australia, and certainly not something we’ve found that can be easily transferable to Northern Territory conditions where most communities are on these prepaid metering systems,” she added.
“Unless we can get transparent, equitable and direct benefits to Indigenous households, there’s not really any point in [First Nations] organisations using what little resources they have to invest in solar and battery assets at the moment, and certainly there’s been no support forthcoming from the government to look any sort of large-scale solar rollout for community and public housing.”
Coming back to the ANU study, which was published in Nature Energy, it found households with high electricity use located in the central climate zones of Australia had a one-in-three chance of a same-day disconnection on very hot or very cold days. This is compounded by the poor quality of the housing which is often also overcrowded.
The study’s authors note their already alarming figures might actually be an “underestimate” as well, since there are many more households using prepayment metering than those represented in the study.
“Remote communities are not covered by the policy protections that the vast majority of Australians enjoy,”  report author Dr Thomas Longden, from ANU, said.
“These communities are facing the failure of policy around the collision of climate change and energy regulation. It’s dangerous for Indigenous communities,” the study’s co-author Dr Simon Quilty, an ANU researcher based in central Australia, said.
He described the power cuts is “punishing Indigenous communities” as they face climate change and a global pandemic.

Specifically, the government wants to see its 6,355 hectares of freehold land at Abbot Point, just north of Bowen, transformed by major projects to become the Salisbury Plains Industrial Precinct.
The project’s technology parter is Fulcrum3D and uses their flagship Sodar portable monitoring unit, fitted with additional pyranometers, with that data made available through its data management system FlightDECK around the clock. 
“We’ve been monitoring the downloads and they’re certainly being accessed and accessed a fair few times,” Fulcrum3D’s founder and managing director, Colin Bonner, told pv magazine Australia.
“From our perspective, it’s fantastic to see proactive government strategy and policies,” he said. “That’s sort of been driven by industry,” Bonner added, noting that in the 10 years since he founded the company government’s have tended to be quite sluggish with policy reform and adoption of renewables. 

While the 24 month program is still ongoing (data monitoring commenced back in November 2020), Bonner said that so far it has demonstrated “strong potential” for both wind and solar projects.
Fulcrum3D’s Sodar product launched the company back in 2011, and works similarly to a sonar on a submarine, scattering sound off thermal turbulence in the  atmosphere through a pulse sent out every couple of seconds. 
With the rise of wind-solar colocation, Bonner said most developers also opt to add a few pyranometers to monitor solar irradiance on site, with the company using German Kipp & Zonen’s SMP11.
Fulcrum3D
“The aim of the game here is to reduce [yield] uncertainly,” Bonner said. He noted that there’s all kinds of ways to collect solar irradiance data, with satellite data usually having a margin of error between 5% to 10%. Using a pyranometer on site brings that uncertainly down to between 3% to 5%.
Each of the Sodar units collects 5 GB to 10 GB of data each month, with a major part of Fulcrum3D’s offering then the cyber infrastructure which manages these immense datasets. 
This data is usually highly confidential, of course, seen by no one except the developers and their technical advisory firms. This is the first time the company has worked with a government to make it public – though Bonner said it probably won’t be the last.
“We are in discussions with other government departments in different states,” he said, though he was unable to give any more details on precisely who they were.“But certainly other government bodies [are] exploring a model of demonstrating the land they manage or have access to has good resources.”
He described the Salisbury Plains project as a great opportunity. “Because it’s the government and they already have land rights, they are trying to attract developers to that area. So it’s in their interest to basically make it public… it’s almost leaning into the ethos of the Renewable Energy Zones where they are trying to encourage developers to work together to have a more efficient process.”
Economic Development Queensland was unable to give pv magazine Australia any indication about whether their strategy had enticed any developers to date, classifying the information as sensitive.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/20/solar-redox-flow-cell-for-residential-energy-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,PORTUGAL",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 20, 2021",Solar redox flow cell for residential energy storage,"From pv magazine Global
Solar redox flow cells (SRFCs) are devices that can store electricity by harvesting sunlight via a photoelectrochemical (PE) panel. These storage devices are attracting increasing interest from scientists and research institutes and have been developed so far only at research level.
Two of the biggest challenges these batteries have to overcome, along with other minor issues, are the fact that their performance is restricted by inefficient photoelectrochemical reactions and that their storage capacity is limited by the physical dimension of solid electrodes.
With this in mind, scientists at the University of Porto have recently developed a solar redox flow cell for decentralised, residential energy storage.
“In our work, we designed, built, and tested the highest photoactive-area solar redox flow cell device ever reported to date,” the research leading author, Telmo da Silva Lopes, told pv magazine. “We also provided important device design guidelines that will help develop future up-scaled SRFCs, an emerging technology that uses semiconductor-based photoelectrodes to store solar energy in chemical bonds and heat.”
Called SolarFlow25, the device was designed to optimise light absorption by the semiconductor and ensure effective diffusion of redox species while offering minimal electronic and ionic transport resistance.
The device has a 25cm2 photoactive area and was built with a large-area PE cell linked to the system structure via small stainless steel screws and an auxiliary metallic rim. “These screws create an electrical path between the conductive metal layer on the perimeter and edges of the PE and the end plate, allowing for … effective current collection,” the Portuguese group explained. “To assemble the cell, both anodic and cathodic compartments were screwed together using bolts with a Nafion 117 membrane in between.”
The system also relies on ferrocyanide/anthraquinone (2,7-AQDS) redox flow chemistry and nanostructured hematite (α-Fe2O3) photoelectrodes combined in series with a dye-sensitised solar cell (DSSC) that is able to produce a photocurrent of approximately 40 mA.
The SRFC was connected to a conventional redox flow cell (RFC) and its performance was tested. “By connecting the SolarFlow25 cell with a conventional RFC, the electrochemical fuels were photocharged and discharged in continuous operation exhibiting an unbiased photocurrent of around 11 mA during photocharge (100 mW/cm2) and a round-trip efficiency of around 0.15%,” the academics emphasised. “These photocharging results were further improved using a sponge-like nanocube, α -Fe2O3, photoelectrode that provided an unbiased photocurrent of around 40 mA during photocharge, resulting in a round-trip efficiency of around 0.44% during the 10 cycle/14-hour demonstration.”
These efficiency levels are claimed to be fourfold higher than any other results reported for α-Fe2O3-driven SRFCs to date.
The academics stressed that no leakage or electrical problems were detected for the device during the experiment, which they said lays the ground for further improving the proposed technology. “We hope that our contribution will help bring SRFCs closer to commercialisation, on its way to revolutionise energy storage for households and stationary applications,” Silva Lopes concluded.
The device is described in the study “A 25 cm2 Solar Redox Flow Cell: Facing the Engineering Challenges of Upscaling,” published in Advanced Energy Materials.
A  low-cost redox flow battery powered by perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells was presented in July 2020 by researchers from the Wisconsin-Madison and Utah State universities, in the United States. This device combines photo-electrochemical solar cells with aqueous organic redox-flow battery technology and has solar-to-output efficiency of 20.1%.
