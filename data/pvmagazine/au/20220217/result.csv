https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/17/electranet-announces-major-milestone-for-interstate-transmission-project/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 17, 2022",ElectraNet announces ‘major’ milestone for interstate transmission project,"South Australia’s high-voltage transmission network owner ElectraNet has announced construction of the South Australian (SA) section of the 900-kilometre Project EnergyConnect, which will link the energy grids of SA, New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, is now underway with the first of an estimated 380 new transmission towers installed at Robertstown in the state’s mid-north.
The $2.28 billion EnergyConnect project, a joint venture between ElectraNet and NSW network operator Transgrid, will link Robertstown and Wagga Wagga in southwest NSW via Buronga, with an extension linking Buronga to Red Cliffs in northwest Victoria. The interconnector will provide 800MW of nominal transfer capacity in both directions and is forecast to unlock some 5.3GW of new wind, solar PV and energy storage projects.
ElectraNet, which has invested $457.4 million to deliver the SA section of the project, said the first two transmission poles were installed at Robertstown on Tuesday.
An estimated 380 transmission towers will be erected as part of the SA section of the project, along with approximately 200 kilometres of 330 kV new transmission line between the SA and NSW border. The SA component of the project will also include the construction of a new substation at Bundey and upgrades to existing substations at Robertstown and Tungkillo.
Downer Utilities Australia has been awarded the transmission lines contract and Consolidated Power Projects Australia has secured the substations contract.
ElectraNet interim chief executive Rainer Korte said the installation of the first towers is a “significant milestone” for the project.

“Project EnergyConnect is a key project of national significance that will help improve the affordability, reliability and security of electricity supply for South Australians and strengthen the National Electricity Market (NEM),” he said.
“The new transmission line will connect SA and NSW, allowing for the sharing of energy between the states.
“Its route passes through high-quality renewable energy zones (REZ), facilitating the transition of more renewable energy into the National Electricity Market. In South Australia, the new interconnector will enable more wind, solar and battery projects to connect to the network.”
The commencement of construction of the SA section comes just weeks after TransGrid said it had begun early works on the NSW component of the interconnector.
Transgrid, which has committed $1.83 billion to the project, will deliver the bulk of the interconnector, approximately 700km of transmission assets.
Identified as a priority project in both AEMO’s Integrated System Plan and the NSW Government’s Transmission Infrastructure Strategy, the EnergyConnect project is expected to improve energy security in both states and help accelerate the transition to a grid based around wind, solar and storage.
“This is a project that was first conceived 20 years ago,” SA Energy Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan said. “To see the work actually start, work that will allow us to generate even more renewable electricity and of course provide greater grid stability … is fantastic.”
Construction work on the SA section of the new interconnector is expected to be completed in late 2023. It is expected to generate more than 200 regional jobs and once completed, approximately 250 ongoing jobs.

“Infinite Energy advises it will cease selling solar rooftop and battery systems for both residential and commercial rooftops due to changing sector dynamics and previous national expansion plans being impacted by the onset of the pandemic,” the company said in a statement.
Infinite Energy chief executive officer Andrew Sutherland said it had been “a very difficult decision” given the company’s many years of operation.
“While the Western Australia (WA) solar market continues to add rooftop solar capacity, establishing a sustainable business model that can support a quality product offering in a highly saturated, low margin and low barrier-to-entry solar market has proved a challenge,” he said.
The company, which was wholly acquired by Japanese industrial giant Sumitomo Corporation in 2019, said it will continue to honour its obligations by completing outstanding installation contracts and providing associated support services.
“We want to reassure our customers that we will continue to honour our commitments, both supporting existing installations in terms of warranty as well as completing new installations currently under contract,” it said.
Founded in 2009, Infinite Energy has established itself as one of the nation’s largest retailers of residential and commercial solar PV and battery energy systems with offices in WA, Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia.
As well as installing and selling distributed solar power systems, battery storage and EV charging infrastructure, Infinite Energy also has an electricity retailing arm. The company owns and operates a portfolio of solar energy systems at clients’ premises and retails the energy from those systems.
Infinite Energy said its electricity retail and solar Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) services would continue to operate while the future plans for the business are reviewed.
The decision to exit the installation and supply business comes despite the state government revealing that a record 3,000 WA households are installing rooftop solar systems each month.
More than 400,000 WA homes and businesses now have rooftop solar connected to WA’s main grid with more than 191MW of generation capacity added in 2021 alone.
That influx has triggered the introduction of new rules that allow for the electricity market operator to remotely switch off rooftop solar panels when the grid is at risk of being overloaded.
WA this week followed South Australia to become the second state to allow residential rooftop solar systems to be switched off remotely as an emergency backstop to keep the grid stable.

Meridian Energy and Contact Energy are looking to establish a large-scale green hydrogen production and export facility in the Southland region using renewable energy supplied by the existing 800MW Manapouri hydroelectric power station.
The largest hydroelectric generator in New Zealand, Manapouri currently supplies the Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter, which consumes about 12% of New Zealand’s electricity. That supply agreement is set to expire in December 2024.
The exit of the smelter, majority-owned by Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto, will free up an estimated 4,800GWh of renewable energy per year and Meridian and Contact are looking to repurpose that renewable electricity into the emerging green hydrogen industry.
Meridian and Contact this week announced a shortlist of four potential development partners for the project, including FFI and Woodside.
Other companies included on the shortlist were Britian-based engineering and gas supply company BOC, and a consortium featuring Japanese commercial giant Mitsui and Eneos.
The Meridian and Contact joint venture said the shortlist was selected after a registration of interest process attracted more than 80 responses.

Meridian chief executive Neal Barclay said the shortlist is a major step forward in the commercialisation of Southland’s green hydrogen opportunity.
“These shortlisted counterparties all have strong hydrogen supply chain capability and a willingness to invest in the opportunity,” he said.
“Their involvement demonstrates that markets for green hydrogen are imminent, and that Aotearoa’s renewable energy resources have substantial potential to help decarbonise our domestic economy and increase export earnings.”
The joint venture said the shortlisted parties would now put together early stage business plans and cases for the large-scale green hydrogen production facility. Their plans are due to be submitted by mid-April.
The chosen partner or partners is expected to be announced by the middle of 2022 with development activities to commence in the second half of the year.
Contact chief executive officer Mike Fuge said Southern Green Hydrogen was one of the most advanced large-scale projects in the world in terms of its progress to market.
“It’s good to see things moving forward with the RFP and bring the project closer to fruition,” he said.
“There has been a massive amount of interest from leading engineering firms involved with green hydrogen.”

The announcement is the latest green hydrogen project for FFI.
FFI founder and Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest has previously announced ambitious plans to build one of the biggest renewable energy portfolios in the world, delivering more than 235 GW of renewable capacity. And in recent months, FFI has also announced plans with AGL to flip New South Wales’s coal generators in the Hunter Valley to green hydrogen, and to build the world’s biggest electrolyser manufacturing plant in Queensland.
Woodside also recently indicated its intent to expand into the production and supply of hydrogen, announcing plans to construct a $1 billion hydrogen and ammonia plant in Kwinana on Western Australia’s south coast. It has also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Tasmanian government to develop a hydrogen and ammonia production plant in the island state.

With consumers being warned daily about inflation on everything from the weekly food shop to tabletop wargame miniatures, London-based analyst GlobalData has stated rooftop solar panels will be no exception.
With the pandemic and its knock-on effects on global supply chains having, since 2020, halted years of thumping panel price cost reductions, a report published today by GlobalData stated that as far as rooftop solar modules are concerned: “Cost is expected to moderately increase in 2022.”
Interestingly, a note issued by the analyst to publicise its Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Market, 2021 – Global Market Size, Market Share, Major Trends, and Key Country Analysis to 2030 report did not point to last year’s shortage of panel raw material polysilicon as a reason for rising module prices.
GlobalData power analyst Attaurrahman Ojindaram Saibasan instead highlighted the fact post-Covid supply chain headaches had reduced the volume of solar cells and modules available for shipping, with delays in shipments confounded by shortages of workers due to pandemic-related restrictions on movement.
Basing its numbers on the 10-12 340W solar panels required to power a 1,200 square foot residence, GlobalData said the cost of rooftop arrays had fallen US$600-900 (AU$830-$1250) per year from a level of around US$9,300 (AU$13,300) in 2014 to US$4,550 (AU$6,250) by the time Covid-19 brought the world to a standstill in 2020.
Last year, by contrast, the price of a rooftop system rebounded US$700 (AU$970) to a level not seen since 2018, GlobalData said, and that increasing expense is not expected to be reversed this year.
Even when a return to falling rooftop solar prices arrives in 2023, the rest of the decade will be marked by costs that decline “gradually,” according to the analyst, as component costs retreat again, production volume is scaled up, and panel technology advances.
The study noted that with the world’s rooftop solar systems in 2020 roughly split a third for residential and two-thirds for commercial and industrial arrays, China accounted for 12.4% of the near-249GW of rooftop panel generation capacity installed by the end of that year.
That contribution helped Asia claim 53.5% of the world’s rooftop panels at the end of 2020, with 29.1% in Europe and 13.6% in the Americas, according to GlobalData.

NSW Energy Minister Matt Kean said on Wednesday the state had received commercial interest to develop 24 solar PV projects, 35 large-scale battery energy storage systems and eight pumped hydro projects in the Hunter-Central Coast REZ. Investors have also proposed 13 onshore and seven offshore wind energy projects.
Kean said the overwhelming result shows that the Hunter and Central Coast, home to four of NSW’s five coal-fired power stations, will continue to serve as the state’s energy powerhouse long into the future.
“These results show that energy investors see the Hunter and Central Coast as some of the best investment destinations anywhere in the country, which will translate into jobs and prosperity for the region,” he said.
“Renewable Energy Zones are vital to ensuring the future reliability and affordability of electricity in NSW as traditional coal-fired power stations close down over the coming decades.”
The state government wants to see at least 12GW of renewable energy and 2GW of energy storage projects developed before 2030 to fill the gap created by the planned retirement of the state’s ageing coal-fired generation fleet.

Four of the state’s five existing coal-fired generators are due to close within the next 15 years but there are signs that timeframe could be fast tracked.
Energy giant AGL earlier this month announced it will bring forward the closure of several of its coal-fired power plants, including the Bayswater power station in the Hunter.
AGL said the 2.64GW Bayswater power plant is to be shuttered “no later than” 2033, two years ahead of its previously scheduled closure of 2035, while the 2GW Liddell power station, also in the Hunter, is scheduled to close by April 2023.
The Energy Corporation of NSW (EnergyCo), which was established to oversee the coordination of transmission, generation, firming and storage projects within the state’s REZs, said that at the end of December 2021, there were already 13 distinct large-scale renewable energy and battery storage projects in the Hunter and Central Coast regions that are either approved or progressing through the NSW planning system. These projects have a combined generation capacity of around 1.9GW and represent about $1.85 billion in investment.
Parliamentary secretary for the Central Coast, Adam Crouch, said the results of the registration of interest in the REZ showed that the region is set to reap the jobs and investment rewards as the state transitions to renewable energy.
“The REZ will not only attract investment in clean energy, it will also underpin the growth of new low-carbon industries such as green hydrogen, ammonia and metals production which the world is going to need as it decarbonises,” he said.

Member for Upper Hunter Dave Layzell said the REZ would set the state up to be an economic and energy superpower.
“The Hunter-Central Coast region is the perfect location for a new REZ as it has good renewable energy resources, access to transmission, transport and port infrastructure, and most importantly, a highly skilled workforce,” he said.
The Hunter-Central Coast REZ is one of five designated clean energy zones detailed in the NSW Government’s electricity roadmap. REZs will also be developed in the Central-West Orana, New England, South-West and Illawarra regions.
The response to the Hunter-Central Coast REZ continues the huge market interest in the REZs with earlier processes in the Central West Orana, New England and South-West regions attracting a combined 95GW of interest.
EnergyCo, which will oversee the coordination of transmission, generation, firming and storage projects within the state’s REZs, said in a statement it is in the early stages of planning the Hunter-Central Coast REZ and will be using the expressions of interest to inform the timing, capacity and boundaries of the zone.
EnergyCo said it will engage closely with industry, local government, local communities and other stakeholders as it progresses the design and delivery of the REZ.
It is expected that the Hunter-Central Coast REZ will be formally declared under the NSW Government’s Electricity Roadmap legislation by mid-2022.

Researchers at the Utah State University (USU), in the United States, have fabricated a prototype of an aqueous organic redox flow battery (AORFB) with an anode based on viologen, which is an inexpensive, water-soluble organic compound providing highly reversible redox reactions.
“Viologen is not expensive with scalable production,” researcher Tianbiau Liu told pv magazine. “The estimated cost of viologen flow batteries is under $100/kWh.”
The battery was conceived to be mainly used to store electricity generated by large scale wind and solar power plants, although its creators do not exclude it may also find application in residential and commercial projects. “Unlike established li-ion, Pb-acid, or vanadium flow batteries, USU’s AORFB can meet the safety and cost targets necessary for viability at large scale,” the research group emphasised.
The ph-neutral battery is claimed to be more cost-effective, sustainable, and efficient than conventional redox flow batteries. “This system can be scaled to buffer the intermittent energy output from wind and solar while maintaining a safe, non-flammable and non-corrosive energy storage system at residential, military, industrial and utility system installations,” they added.
The device has a rated power of over 150mW/cm2, an energy density exceeding 40Wh/L, and a power density of 72.5mW/cm2. “Pairing with water-soluble TEMPO or ferrocene cathode materials, the AORFBs deliver up to 1.72V voltage and 45.5Wh/L theoretical energy density with excellent cycling stability,” the scientists said, noting the device is also able to retain 100% of its initial capacity after 1,000 cycles.
The high-conductivity aqueous electrolytes and ion-conductive membranes used for the device are described as the crucial components, allowing high current and high power operation.
“We started developing the battery in 2014 and we are currently seeking to bring it to commercial production,” Liu stated.
A complete description of the battery, the cathodes, and the anode can be found in the paper “Unprecedented Capacity and Stability of Ammonium Ferrocyanide Catholyte in pH Neutral Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries,” published in Joule.
