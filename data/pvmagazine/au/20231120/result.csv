The NT government said the facility at Wurrumiyanga on Bathurst Island, part of the Tiwi Islands about 80 kilometres northwest of Darwin, is expected to begin operations early next year with the installation of the prefabricated solar arrays provided by clean technology innovator 5B now complete.
Sydney-headquartered modular solar array manufacturer 5B said a team of four workers took just four days to deploy 1.2 MW of the company’s prefabricated Maverick system.
5B Chief Strategy Officer Nicole Kuepper-Russell said the project utilises the company’s latest generation high-wind resilient Maverick solar array. With a wind rating of up to 72 metres per second, the system has been specifically designed for cyclone-prone regions like the Tiwi Islands.
“It is also fast to deploy in remote regions,” Kuepper-Russell said. “A deployment team of four unfolded the 1.2 MW 5B solar farm on Bathurst Island in just four days, with mechanical installation, including unpacking, staging, cabling, the extra anchoring required for wind region C and clean up, taking less than two weeks.”
The solar array is part of the $6.1 million (USD 3.99 million) Wurrumiyanga Solar Infill and Energy Storage Pilot Project which is providing an upgrade for the community’s energy system which includes aging diesel infrastructure and dated solar technology.
The NT government said the updated off-grid power plant will displace some of Wurrumiyanga’s current diesel-generated power supply with renewables. It is expected that the percentage of renewable energy delivered to the community of about 2,000 will increase to almost 50%.
NT Renewables Minister Nicole Manison said the project is an important part of the government’s renewables targets and will help inform other clean energy projects in the Territory.
“This is an important step towards the Territory government achieving our target of 50% renewables by 2030, which includes an average of 70% renewables in communities supplied by Indigenous Essential Services,” she said.
“We look forward to extending the lessons learnt from this project to other remote Territory communities.”

The progress at Wurrumiyanga comes after it was confirmed that the NT community of Titjikala had achieved a clean energy milestone with solar-powered renewables providing 83% of the remote town’s energy requirements in September.
The NT government said Titjikala, about 130 kilometres south of Alice Springs and home to 200 residents, was solely powered by renewable energy for an average of 20 hours per day during the month.
Titjikala has a 400 kW solar array, integrated with a 970 kWh battery energy storage system.
It is one of 25 communities that were part of our Solar Energy Transformation Program that integrated 10 MW of solar in remote communities to transition to a renewable energy future and reduce reliance on diesel fuel.

Fortescue said the manufacturing facility is being developed in the state of Michigan as part of the company’s plan to rapidly expand its US presence as a direct result of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
The IRA, which is aimed at ramping up onshore production of renewable energy, electrification and the development of clean energy industries such as green hydrogen, offers subsidies, grants and tax breaks to businesses to establish clean energy projects in the US.
Fortescue’s new manufacturing centre is expected to benefit directly from IRA tax credits for battery modules, offering approximately $15 (USD 10) per kWh.
Fortescue Executive Chairman and founder Andrew Forrest said the IRA has changed the US from a laggard to a world leader in clean energy, demonstrating that countries which incentivise green energy place an “economic engine” firmly inside their economies.
“The IRA makes the United States the most attractive place in the world for green energy and green manufacturing projects,” he said.
“Fortescue is putting the United States at the forefront of our global strategy, with the incentives on offer, a win for both the US and the wider Asia-Pacific region.”
The company said the Michigan facility, projected to employ up to 600 people in its initial phase, will serve as a major hub for Fortescue’s production of batteries, fast chargers, and hydrogen generators and electrolysers.
“Michigan and the United States are extremely attractive places to manufacture, given the skilled workforce, existing supply chain and incentives from state and federal governments, including the Inflation Reduction Act,” Fortescue Energy Chief Executive Officer Mark Hutchinson said.
The new manufacturing facility is one of three clean energy projects Fortescue has planned in the US.
Fortescue is targeting a final investment decision this year for the Phoenix Hydrogen Hub, an electrolyser and liquefaction facility in Arizona. Stage one of the project is planned to include an 80 MW electrolyser and liquefaction facility capable of producing up to 12,000 tonnes of liquified green hydrogen annually.
Fortescue is also planning to construct a large-scale green hydrogen production plant near in the state of Washington. The Centralia project has been selected as part of the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub to receive funding from the US Department of Energy. The project is currently in the design stage with a final investment decision yet to be taken by the Fortescue board.

“This investment will ensure the electricity network, one of the world’s largest isolated systems, successfully transitions to an innovative green electricity ecosystem for the future,” government-owned utility Western Power said in a statement, highlighting that the upgrades are essential to enable large-scale renewable energy generation to connect to the grid, for both domestic use and to facilitate new industries like renewable hydrogen.
Western Power said $575 million has been allocated to increase capacity of the network’s northern section. This will involve upgrading the current mix of 132 kV and 330 kV lines to unlock the transmission capacity in the Wheatbelt and Mid-West regions.
A further $133 million will be invested towards planning for new lines, reinforcements and upgrades around key industrial areas, including Kwinana and Collie, as well as upgrades between Geraldton and Perth to support development at Oakajee.
WA Premier Roger Cook said strengthening the northern transmission network is critical to unlocking the state’s renewable energy potential, with modelling indicating a 10‑fold increase in renewable generation may be needed to meet future low-emissions electricity demand.
“Put simply, there is no energy transition without better transmission,” he said. “This is the largest investment in transmission infrastructure in WA in more than 10 years and is an important step on the transformation of our main electricity grid.”
The delivery of new electricity infrastructure will be coordinated by newly established entity PoweringWA. Located within the Department of Energy, Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety, PoweringWA will be responsible for planning, community consultation, industry liaison and project management.
The funding announcement has been widely welcomed by industry with Chamber of Minerals and Energy WA (CME) Chief Executive Officer Rebecca Tomkinson saying it is a much-needed investment in the state’s renewable energy future.
“We know the demand for reliable energy is increasing and will continue to increase the closer we are to 2030 so it’s a positive step that the WA government has listened and is taking action,” she said. “I think the state government is realistic about the need to exponentially increase production in order to establish our energy transition capability.”
“What we need now is a roadmap that clearly defines the path forward, and more than that, clears the path forward in terms of regulatory approvals, policy stability and efficient processes.”

Terabase Energy, developer of Terafab, an automated utility-scale solar installation platform, announced it has successfully completed its first commercial installation. The company’s “field factory” installed 17 MW of a 225 MW solar project in Arizona in development by Leeward Renewable Energy and engineering and construction contractor RES.
The Terafab system makes use of digital twins, logistics software, an on-site digital command center, a field-deployed automated assembly line, and installation rovers that can operate 24/7.
In the Arizona project, Terabase said its labour productivity improved 25% when compared with manual installation.
“[The project] demonstrates that Terabase’s technology can drive substantial progress in solar construction safety, quality, cost, and schedule,” said Will Schultek, vice president of construction, RES.
The installation system cuts the amount of labour needed on-site and improves working conditions for labourers. Workers are housed in shaded and cooled conditions, allowing for system operation and installation in harsh desert environments.

Reducing labor requirements to install utility-scale solar projects may prove useful for accelerating the energy transition. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) projects a demand of 800,000 new solar workers by 2030 to build the projects the United States needs to be on pace with its decarbonization plan. However, 44% of solar industry employers report it is “very difficult” to find qualified applicants, said the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC).
Terabase’s field factory also enabled a 100% return on solar panel packaging for reuse by the manufacturer.
Leeward Renewable Energy executive vice president of project execution Sam Mangrum said the benefits demonstrated in the project underscore the “transformative potential of automation” in solar.
“This milestone marks a pivotal moment in our mission to accelerate solar plant deployment to meet the terawatt scale demands of the future,” said Matt Campbell, chief executive officer at Terabase Energy. “Furthermore, the Terafab system was deployed alongside our Construct digital twin software for managing and monitoring solar power plant construction.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/20/cool-roofs-increase-power-yield-in-bifacial-rooftop-pv-systems/,"RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 20, 2023",‘Cool roofs’ increase power yield in bifacial rooftop PV systems,"From pv magazine Global
An Algerian-Spanish research team has looked at how cool roofs (CR) could help increase power yield in bifacial rooftop PV systems and has found that the proposed combination offers higher energy yields than bifacial counterparts deployed on conventional roofs.
The scientists explained that cool roofs are roofs made of highly reflective coatings with a high emissivity in the thermal infrared. “They are normally used on building roofs because they lower their temperature compared to corresponding roofs without the coating,” they said. “They have been shown to significantly reduce the energy required for cooling buildings and the heat island effect in urban environments and can offer economic benefits.”
These roofs are based on coating materials with high reflectance properties, which the researchers said increases the radiation received at the panels’ backside.
The group tested its new approach on the test bench located on a building in Barcelona. The installation comprises four PV systems, each consisting of three bifacial PV modules connected in series. The systems are a reference monofacial array, a bifacial array above a conventional floor, a bifacial array above a cool-roof-coated floor, and a bifacial array above the normal floor with other types of PV modules.
For all systems, the academics used 320 W modules from Chinese manufacturer JA Solar and 1.5 kW inverters from China-based Solax. The testing period ran from April 2020 to November 2021. During the winter months, the surrounding buildings cast shadows on the arrays.
The analysis showed that the bifacial array above a cool-roof-coated floor achieved the highest energy yield.
“When a cool roof coating is used beneath the bifacial modules, PV production can be substantially boosted (+8.6%) compared to the monofacial solution, meaning an economic benefit about 18.3 €/kWp/year,” the group said. “Moreover, the [cool roof] coating can help reduce floor temperatures in unshaded areas during summer (−3.8 °C), potentially leading to significant energy savings in cooling the building.”
The scientists said that cool roofs could be either added to the floor of existing bifacial rooftop PV systems or used for new installations. “It is an already available market product with reasonable costs that offers dual advantages: increased energy yield and reduced building cooling consumption, both yielding economic benefits,” they concluded.
The researchers presented their findings “Experimental energy performance assessment of a bifacial photovoltaic system and effect of cool roof coating,” which was recently published in the Journal of Building Engineering. The research group is formed by academics from Spain’s research center Tecnalia, Algeria’s Center for the Development of Renewable Energies (CDER), the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, and the University of the Basque Country.
