Queensland Energy minister Mick de Brenni said the Kogan Hydrogen Demonstration Plant, to be developed by government-owned generator CS Energy, will go ahead after a successful feasibility study with Japanese industrial giant IHI Corporation Japan.
De Brenni said the facility would be built beside the existing Kogan Creek Power Station and would include the co-location of a solar farm, battery energy storage system, hydrogen electrolyser and a hydrogen fuel cell.
The minister said the project was unique because the facility will be powered exclusively by behind-the-meter solar energy, making it one of the few truly green hydrogen projects in Australia.
De Brenni said the project has already attracted “strong interest” from potential domestic off-takers.
“The Kogan Creek project is an opportunity for publicly owned CS Energy to stake its territory in the hydrogen sector and expand Queenslanders’ ownership of renewable energy assets,” he said.
“Better yet, CS Energy are looking to support the decarbonisation of the heavy transport and haulage market with their locally produced zero emission fuel and discussions are well advanced with multiple potential off-takers.”

CS Energy chief executive officer Andrew Bills said the feasibility study had confirmed the optimum design of the renewable hydrogen plant and that Kogan Creek Power Station was a good location with existing assets and plenty of space for expansion opportunities.
“This project offers multiple benefits for CS Energy because of hydrogen’s ability to be used as both a fuel and as a way to store energy,” he said.
“In addition to selling hydrogen into the domestic market, CS Energy can use the plant’s battery to provide grid stability services in the Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) Market.”
Construction on the Kogan Creek facility is expected to commence in 2022 with commissioning scheduled in early 2023.
The announcement comes amid a flurry of green hydrogen activity in the Sunshine State.
Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) on Monday announced plans to establish a 2 GW green hydrogen manufacturing facility near Gladstone in central Queensland.
That was followed by FFI teaming with fertiliser and chemical manufacturer Incitec Pivot to announce that they will “assess whether industrial scale manufacturing of green ammonia at Gibson Island is technically and commercially feasible on an existing brownfield site”.
The two companies will examine whether a new electrolysis plant at Incitec’s Gibson Island facility near Brisbane can produce about 50,000 tonnes of renewable hydrogen per year, which would then be converted into green ammonia for Australian and export markets.
FFI and Incitec will look at the feasibility of converting the existing facility, which currently produces more than 300,000 tonnes of ammonia each year, from natural gas to green hydrogen.
Incitec CEO Jeanne Johns said the partnership was considered one of Australia’s best near-term opportunities to produce green ammonia at an industrial scale.
“We’re excited to partner with FFI who are committed to producing zero-emission hydrogen from 100% renewable sources,” she said.
“The combination of FFI’s drive to develop a globally competitive green hydrogen industry, and our leadership and technical skills in ammonia production, will play an important role in developing Australia’s capability in this growing international market.”

That announcement was followed on Tuesday by resource sector heavyweight Rio Tinto signing a statement of cooperation with the Queensland government to investigate off-take agreements for large-scale renewable energy projects to power its assets, including the Boyne Island aluminium smelter near Gladstone.
Rio Tinto Aluminium chief executive officer Ivan Vella said the company, the state’s largest energy user, is ideally positioned to work with the government in the transition to a low-carbon economy.
“We are working closely with the Queensland government on the role we can play by underwriting long-term green offtake for our industrial assets,” he said.
“This should help create the industrial demand needed to develop a globally competitive green energy solution and lead to more processing and manufacturing in central Queensland.”
The mining giant is the first partner to join the multi-signatory statement with Deputy Premier Steven Miles saying government is determined to work with industry to find ways to build more renewable energy faster.
“This will be a multi-signatory statement which will ensure that Central Queensland becomes one of the first regions in the world to benefit from the massive growth in demand for renewable energy,” he said.
“This will demonstrate Queensland’s capability and attract investors looking to use clean energy to create their futures and the jobs that come with it.”

Enerven, which has delivered large-scale solar, Virtual Power Plants (VPP) and standalone battery systems across the National Electricity Market (NEM), will act as CEP’s exclusive EPC services contractor in South Australia, and its preferred contractor in other states.
CEP chief executive officer Peter Wright said the partnership paved the way for multiple projects, including the planned Lionsgate project, a 24 MW rooftop solar farm and 150 MW grid-scale battery to be developed on the site of the former Holden car manufacturing plant at Elizabeth in South Australia, to be progressed and for CEP to achieve substantial scale in a shorter timeframe.
“CEP.Energy has ambition to become the largest distributed renewable energy and storage developer and owner in Australia through strategic partnerships with large C&I property owners and specialist delivery partners,” he said.
“Partnering with Enerven will help facilitate that by giving us a single point of contractor relationship and delivery for our large pipeline of projects involving embedded networks, solar and storage projects across Australia.”
Under the agreement, Enerven will provide project design and delivery to support CEP’s ongoing C&I and VPP program. Enerven will provide technical assessment and site feasibility analysis, and help design, install, operate and maintain systems.

Enerven general manager Richard Amato said the company will also provide technical and advisory services to advance CEP’s proposed utility scale storage network.
This will include providing strategic advice to support grid connection submissions, detailed engineering design and early selection of technology, installation and operation.
“Enerven is thrilled to be CEP.Energy’s national delivery partner for their ambitious and exciting renewable program,” he said.
“We are very proud to be at the forefront of the current renewables revolution and working with clients like CEP.Energy, who want to create a more cost efficient, environmentally sustainable future for Australia is extremely rewarding.”
CEP, which finances, builds, owns and operates renewable energy microgrids and virtual power plants (VPPs) in partnership with property portfolio groups, has an impressive pipeline of renewable energy projects that includes more than 70 C&I embedded networks with solar and onsite battery storage.

The company said Phase 1 of the roll-out has commenced with 2.9 MW of rooftop solar installed in recent months and 11 MW of battery storage in the installation or planning phase.
The installation of 2.6 MW of solar and 4 MW of storage at the Narellan Town Centre project, described by the CEP as Australia’s largest retail renewable energy project, is also progressing.
CEP has also announced plans to develop a 2 GW utility scale battery storage portfolio, including the $200 million Lionsgate Energy Storage System in South Australia. The current estimate is that construction of the project will commence in 2023.
The battery is one of four utility scale battery projects that CEP plans to develop throughout Australia, including a 1.2 GW megabattery in the Hunter region of New South Wales (NSW).
Wright has previously said the $2.4 billion Hunter Big Battery will be developed in stages with construction on the project expected to begin in Q1 2022 with hopes of it being operational in 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/12/iron-flow-battery-tech-shows-promise-for-mid-duration-energy-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 12, 2021",Iron flow battery tech shows promise for mid-duration energy storage,"From pv magazine USA
Iron flow battery manufacturer ESS Inc. has been in the news lately, most recently for releasing an updated version of its product guarantee.
Munich RE, one of the world’s largest reinsurance companies, also updated its insurance policy for ESS to address customer concerns over technology risk. ESS told pv magazine USA that the new policy covers the battery modules and electrolyte management system, as well any needed repairs or replacement for the first 10 years of the system’s life. ESS manufactures these components itself.

The product’s pump and motor drives have an expected lifetime of 19-22 years. The industrial computer, which was described as “inexpensive,” can be expected to be replaced every 5-7 years. ESS offers an O&M service contract after the 10-year mark.
But even more striking is the battery’s expected longevity. Much like the grid’s oldest assets, (some of which were first built in the 1890s), ESS batteries show the potential to soldier on for many decades. While the ESS battery systems have a prescribed design life of 25 years, the battery modules, electrolyte, plumbing, and other components may well last for decades longer with proper maintenance.
For one thing, the battery is expected to experience zero degradation over 20,000 cycles. By design, iron flow batteries circulate liquid electrolytes to charge and discharge electrons using a process called a redox reaction, which represents a gain of electrons (reduction), and a loss of electrons (oxidation). ESS uses the same electrolyte on both the negative and positive sides, eliminating possible cross-contamination and degradation. As a result, ESS chemistry remains stable for an almost unlimited number of deep-cycle charge and discharge cycles.
Another reason for the expected long operating life is that ESS batteries use a “proton pump” to balance and maintain electrolyte health over the life of the asset.
The pump connects to the tank and passively mixes unwanted hydrogen back into the solution. Doing so maintains the balance of pH and states of charge in the liquid electrolyte circulating through the system.
In human terms, the battery is the heart, the electrolyte is the blood, and the proton pump is the kidney, which keeps everything in balance.
The pump itself is expected to be a key commercial differentiator for ESS. Other flow chemistries need to come offline regularly to rebalance their electrolytes. Not so with the ESS design.
In the unlikely event that the battery is to be decommissioned, the system and all of its components can be substantially recycled.
Any non-ESS manufactured system components come with third-party warranties. The full warranty wasn’t available to be distributed via pv magazine USA.
The company currently offers two products, the single shipping container Energy Warehouse and a string of warehouse units in an Energy Center.
One Energy Warehouse shipping container holds 400-600kWh of storage capacity and can be configured with variable power to provide storage durations of 4-12 hours. That makes the power rating configurable from 50-90 kW. The round-trip efficiency is 70-75%, DC-DC. Each battery weighs 16,000 kg dry, and as much as 38,000 kg after it’s filled with the electrolyte.
For larger volumes of energy storage, ESS will string together multiple batteries in what it calls an Energy Center. At this larger scale, ESS batteries take up some real estate. One acre of batteries holds up to 6 MW/90 MWh, providing up to 12 hours discharge at rated power. These large battery centres are expected to have fast, easy permitting due to the lack of hazmat concerns as well as non-flammable, non-explosive materials.
But the most important news of the day – product sales news – shows that ESS has been busy.
To support its growth, ESS announced that they were to become a publicly listed company through a SPAC merger with ACON S2 Acquisition Corp this past May. And in a great coup, the company will be listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “GWH.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/12/meyer-burger-unveils-new-solar-tiles/,"MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,SWITZERLAND,WORLD",CORNELIA LICHNER,"OCTOBER 12, 2021",Meyer Burger unveils new solar tiles,"From pv magazine Germany
Switzerland-based solar module maker Meyer Burger has unveiled new solar tiles for a building-integrated PV (BIPV) project at the Intersolar event, which is being held this week in Munich, Germany. The new product was designed by German engineering company paXos Consulting & Engineering GmbH & Co. KG, which sold the related patents to Meyer Burger.
The tiles measure 44 cm x 33 cm x 3 cm and weigh in at 2.5 kg. This makes them lighter than normal roof tiles, says paXos Managing Director Peter Hakenberg. He claims this is an important advantage, particularly in relation to snow loads.
The black PV tiles heat up considerably in summer, which is why there is a continuous ventilation duct from the lower to the upper bricks, producing a chimney effect. At the top of the ridge, the hot air can be discharged or used for heating. In the winter, when the temperature differences are not so great, a fan can specifically suck in the heated air and direct it to a heat exchanger or heat pump.
Hakenberg says the paXos prototype has been assessed in wind tunnels and other practical tests. He said the company hopes for a noticeable reduction in costs, compared to conventional rooftop systems.
Frank Hoetzsch, head of service at Meyer Burger, announced that production of the tiles will begin in the second half of 2022. He noted that the company is conducting tests with the Cologne University of Applied Sciences to determine the exact thermal performance of the new product.
