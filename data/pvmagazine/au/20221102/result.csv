In 2021, Nextracker and Array Technologies together commanded 77% of Australia’s “highly concentrated” tracker market, according to analysis from Rystad Energy RenewableCube.
It follows then that the companies, both based in the US, would been keeping a keen eye on one another. Nextracker, the enduring frontrunner controlling the Australian market for the past five years, launched its NX Horizon-XTR line in March. Key to the line’s terrain following capacity is that the XTR trackers work on a principle of being suspended from above, rather than supported from below, Nextracker CEO Dan Shugar told pv magazine Australia.

The company’s main competitor in Australia, Array Technologies, which in January acquired one of Europe’s major tracker manufacturers Soluciones Técnicas Integrales Norland (STI Norland), is following suit. Its terrain-following line, which allows a gradient of 1 degree between piles, is however still almost a year away from market.
Out in front, Nextracker showed off pictures at All Energy 2022 of its first completed XTR project at Melbourne Water’s Winneke Solar Farm. 
The 9.54 MW (DC) plant developed by Beon covers 10 hectares on the shoreline of Sugarloaf Reservoir, just out of Melbourne and sits on a culturally and environmentally significant site where groundwork had to be minimised to avoid disturbing Indigenous artefacts.

“Therefore, a solution to protect the surrounding land from erosion, minimise grading and ground disturbance, and reduce any reseeding time was crucial,” Shugar said.
“The project was also a pre-drill site, which made it even more challenging to construct within the cultural and environmental constraints and variances.”
To cater to the need, Nextracker proposed a maximum pile height of 1.9 metres, which it says was a small percentage of the site, managing to deploy the XTR line without the need for any earthworks at all.

“Before we launched XTR, what we were seeing in the field was a shrinking availability of sites suitable for large scale solar, and this came down to the degree of required earthworks, sometimes cultural sensitivities, safety and risk assessment around the construction of solar on undulating sites,” Shugar said. “So there was a gap in the market for this technology. Since launching, we’ve had a tremendous amount of positive feedback from the industry.”
In terms of cost for XTR, Shugar artfully dodged the question by pointing out the solution ends up cheaper overall because it significantly cuts the costs associated with earthwork and land grading, which can total as much as 5% of a project budget.
Additionally, because much of the XTR’s suspension comes from above, Shugar says the line is able to use significantly less foundations. This, he says, ultimately means the trackers have less steel and can be more quickly deployed, allowing contractors to take on more jobs overall.
Terrain following trackers, Shugar added, are also particularly important in farming. 
In agriculture, protecting top soil is critical for erosion prevention, flood protection and the continued grazing of cattle and sheep. “In areas like southeast USA, certain parts of Australia and other large solar markets, we’re seeing interest in XTR for farm land for this reason,” Shugar said.

As for remediation when projects reach their end of life, Shugar says it is virtually unnecessary from the tracker side. Since the piles are simply rammed into the earth, when they are taken out only an easily-filled hole is left.
“We see sustainability as a critical guiding principle that should sit across all industries, with renewable energy being no different,” Shugar added.
Since launching the line, more than 8 GW of Horizon-XTR installations are operational around the world, “with this number growing rapidly to meet demand.”

Sitting down at All Energy 2022, Array Technologies’ Chief Commercial Officer Erica Brinker told pv magazine Australia the company had launched its own terrain-following tracker for hilly and undulating sites at Munich RE in September.
She claims Array’s line takes away the need for 98% of grading. For comparison, Nextracker claims XTR saves between 30% to 90% of the “cut and fill” earthmoving work.
Deliveries from Array’s line won’t come until 2023. Additionally, Brinker said the company is no longer looking to work with all players in Australia’s industry, but is rather choosing to work with a select few “committed” EPCs and retailers.

The term speaks to the need to ensure supply chains come from political allies – the focus of much of the US and Australian governments recent work together.
Since the pandemic hit, tracker company Nextracker has been moving its manufacturing back to its US base. It’s a strategy CEO Shugar told pv magazine Australia has proven extremely valuable for the company.
Given trackers are largely made from steel, the proposition is relatively simple. When it comes to critical minerals, including rare earths, which are crucial components for technologies like batteries, solar panels and wind turbines, the shift is decidedly more difficult.

China currently controls around 90% of the global production of refined rare earths, and the majority of critical minerals. It’s a position China is seeking to defend, and Australia and the US are moving to undercut.
“Australia can play a role in diversifying supply by not only increasing production of rare earths, but also by increasing our involvement in downstream processing,” Australia’s Minister for Resources Madeleine King said at the Rare Earth Conference.
Analysts Tim Buckley and Matt Pollard have done interesting work on this topic in the last weeks, mapping out projects in development across Australia. Most of the potential lays in West Australia, where a number of refineries from companies like Lynas Rare Earths and Iluka Resources are being constructed.

In June, Lynas, an Australian company which is currently the only major player outside of China to produce and refine rare earths, won a $120 million contract from the US Defence Department to build a processing facility in the US.
Such moves will likely accelerate now with US President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which will see billions invested to boost critical mineral supply chains for the US and allies like Australia.

The Australian government doesn’t seem to be taking such a direct approach to growing the industry though, with minister King highlighting her government is favouring loans and private sector co-investment.
“Last month the Prime Minister and I announced that the government will be refreshing Australia’s Critical Minerals Strategy,” she said yesterday. “The new strategy will be developed in consultation with industry and other stakeholders to best identify how we can help grow the sector.”
In the October budget, the Albanese government said it would allocate $50 million over three years to the Critical Minerals Development Program which King says will go toward “competitive grants to support early and mid-stage critical minerals projects. This funding builds on the $50 million recently committed to six key projects across Australia as part of Tranche 1 of the program, leveraging over $143 million in private sector co-investment.”
In the speech, minister King described herself as surprised to learn there is currently only one rare earths processing facility in the US.
“I suppose I should have known that before,” said King, “but, like many, I presumed there would have been more capacity to refine rare earths in the US. This serves to highlight the importance of Australia’s efforts to develop this processing facility to ensure our partners have diverse supply chains. But for me it was a light-bulb moment, where the magnitude of the opportunity available to Australia was made clear. The responsibility is equally enormous.”

Minister King also drove home the message that the government’s plan is not only to produce critical minerals here in Australia – something the country has been doing for some time in various capacities – but also to begin processing onshore. 
It would be somewhat surprising if this plan to begin critical mineral processing and rare earth refining in Australia doesn’t face serious backlash, given the processes tend to produce high amounts of toxic waste and have significant environmental and health risks.
Such issues were not addressed by the minister, who could hardly be described as an environmentalist nor renewable energy devotee. King has ardently supported Woodside’s Scarborough gas project and has refused to budge to demands from the newly elected “teal” independent members of parliament and the Greens party to end new fossil fuel projects.
Her speech on diverting at least some of the growing critical minerals market to Australia drew near immediate rebuke from Chinese officials. “No one should politicise, instrumentalise or weaponise the world economy,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a press briefing in Beijing.
Speaking to Bloomberg, Minister King acknowledged the play is far more of a long term vision than anything achievable in the coming years, saying it would be a “pipe dream” to think Western countries could end their reliance on China for rare earths and critical minerals in the near future.

After working together for more than a year, the two companies will merge to form Fellton, a design, development and manufacturing company for bolt-in electric vehicle (EV) kits.

The partnership will grow the scale of both businesses, which new Fellton CEO Chris Hazell says will see expansion beyond Australia and the UK into North America.
In a company statement, Hazell added Fellton will be bringing production facilities online “very soon” to allow companies across the continents to buy bolt-in systems which allow any car to become electric.
“As we grow the number of models we support, and supply systems and components to other workshops, you can transform any car, from any era into a reliable, joyful drive with comparable range and charging speed to a new EV,” Dave Budge, cofounder of Jaunt and now Head of Design at Fellton, said on LinkedIn.
Jaunt has been specialising in ‘up-cycling’ 1958 to 2015 Land Rovers into EVs using Tesla battery packs – an exercise which typically costs $125,000 (USD 80,000).

Speaking to The Guardian, Budge said the biggest obstacle the startup has encountered so far is awareness. “Most people don’t know that this is even possible.”
Electric vehicle uptake in Australia has lagged the rest of the world, with EVs accounting for just 3.39% of total new car sales in 2022. That said, this figure is a 65% boost from the year before – demonstrating interest is there.
The slow uptake in Australia has largely been attributed to the country’s lack of fuel efficiency standards, which are commonplace in the rest of the developed world, with Australia and Russia the only outliers. Until recently, Australian governments offered very limited rebates or incentives to drive EV uptake – though the tone here has changed notably in 2022.
While still expensive, EV conversion is an interesting proposition – especially given the fact a significant amount of a vehicle’s CO2 emissions come from their manufacturing.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/02/thailand-introduces-fit-scheme-for-solar-storage/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,POLICY,THAILAND",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"NOVEMBER 2, 2022","Thailand introduces FIT scheme for solar, storage","From pv magazine Global
The Energy Regulatory Commission of Thailand has passed a regulation to set up a FIT scheme for renewable energy, including utility-scale solar, battery energy storage, wind, and biogas.
“The program is rather unexpected given the lack of such in [Thailand’s Power Development Plan] 2018-37,” Moritz Sticher, a senior adviser at Berlin-based consulting firm Apricum, told pv magazine.
The regulation introduces a 25-year FIT of $0.090 (THB 2.1679)/kWh for solar and a 25-year FIT of $0.075 (THB 2.8331)/kWh for solar plus storage.
“The FIT tariff will certainly require some sort of mechanism of tariff adjustment over the term until 2030 given the unknown costs situation by then,” said Sticher.
The quota for solar will be 100 MW per year from 2024 to 2030. For solar and storage, it will be 190 MW in 2024, 290 MW in 2025, 258 MW in 2026, 440 MW in 2028, 310 in 2029, and 390 MW in 2030.
“The total solar and solar plus storage quotas are not really ambitious and since a single project can be up to 90 MW, there will be only a few projects every year,” said Sticher.
Apricum says the scheme will probably be heavily oversubscribed, due to the high number of uncompleted projects in past programs, the attractive tariff, and the large number of market participants. To apply, solar producers must be 51% Thai-owned, which “really limits participation to already established (mainly Thai) players or high-risk takers with flexibility in the legal structuring,” according to Sticher.
Applications will be prescreened according to readiness of land, technology, funding, and project planning. The highest-scoring applications will then be allocated to reach targeted annual capacities according to the allocated quotas. Solar and solar plus storage rank third and fourth after biogas and wind.
Thailand currently has 3.47 GW of installed solar capacity, according to Apricum. The country has updated its 2037 solar targets by reducing the solar capacity target to 8.7 GW and keeping the target for floating solar at 2.73 GW.

NREL has evaluated the trade-offs between extending PV module lifetimes or ramping up closed-loop recycling for solar panels with shorter lifetimes. It presented its findings in “Circular Economy Priorities for Photovoltaics in the Energy Transition,” which was recently published in PLOS One.
Using the United States as a case study, a group of researchers analysed 336 scenarios using the in-house PV Circular Economy Tool (PV ICE). They only considered monocrystalline silicon-based modules.
The researchers assessed the impact on new material demand with different module lifetimes, from 15 to 50 years. They also looked at closed-loop recycling, and assumed that the United States will have 1.75 TW of cumulative PV installed capacity by 2050.
The results show that modules with 50-year lifetimes could reduce new material demand by 3% through lower deployment, in comparison with the 35-year baseline scenario. On the other hand, modules with 15-year lifetimes would require an additional 1.2 TW of replacement modules to maintain 1.75 TW of PV capacity by 2050. That would increase new material demand and waste unless over 95% of the module mass was closed-loop recycled, said the researchers.
“This requires 100% collection and a high-yield, high-value recycling processes, which presents a technology and management challenge because no PV technology has achieved this level of closed-loop recycling for all component materials,” they said.
They added that with sustainable PV supply chains, there is a tendency to go straight to recycling as the solution, but there are many other circular options to try first, like lifetime extensions. They concluded that “offsetting new material demand can be accomplished in ways other than recycling, including high-yield, high-efficiency, reliable systems (thereby reducing replacement and total deployment needs,) remanufacturing of components, and circular material sourcing.”
