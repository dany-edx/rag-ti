The pair are looking to ensure solar panels are properly tested for potential safe reuse rather than going straight to recycling. The partnership comes just as the federal government’s deadline for the solar industry to “step up” its recycling and circularity practices looms in June.
“As there is no legislation in place in Australia to govern the reuse of panels, we believe this agreement [the MoU] is the first step in establishing a second-hand PV market in Australia with the appropriate certification to keep the industry to a high standard when it comes to the testing and verification of panels for reuse,” Clive Fleming, Director of Reclaim PV, said.
In 2021, both Reclaim PV and CPVA (working with PV Lab) undertook separate used solar panel testing projects in response to the increasing prevalence of functional solar panels being dumped at waste stations.
CPVA
“Reclaim PV has already been incorporating a series of performance and safety evaluation tests across our Australian solar panel recycling sites with success,” Fleming said. “For example, recent figures from the testing of around 1,450 solar panels at the Rockhampton Council collection site [in Queensland], has revealed that more than 31% could be considered for reuse instead of going through the recycling process.”
Reclaim PV is also increasingly seeing thousands of used solar panels being exported without any testing for safety or performance, creating a potential problem, Fleming noted. “Our testing has shown that a significant percentage of solar panels being made available for recycling suffer from electricity leakage and if these were to be shipped overseas for reuse, they may pose a danger to installers and users in overseas markets.”
The pair said the agreement aligns with Reclaim PV’s goal to obtain as much value from solar panels through repair and reuse before recycling them, as well as with CPVA’s aim to develop a certification standard for reused solar panels to drive consumer trust around the performance, safety and quality of reused panels.
Figures provided by the federal government show that 2,700 tonnes of solar PV waste was generated in Australia in 2018 as the earliest modules reached their end of life. By 2050 it is expected that figure will climb to 1,532,000 tonnes of PV waste annually.
Co-founder of CPVA, Megan Jones, said the alliance sees its role as providing ‘gold standard’ independent certification of panels for resale and reuse, ultimately providing integrity and credibility to the emerging market.
“We are a not-for-profit and want to see everyone succeed as we move to more circular business practices in solar,” Jones said.
CPVA is currently developing certifications for reused solar panels and certification options for affiliated solar industry businesses.

Likewise, Reclaim PV already has testing procedures in place and arrangements with charities such as SolarBuddy and commercial trader Solar Shift to provide low-cost reused panels to communities that are living in energy poverty.
It has extended its operations substantially over the last year, adding numerous locations and manufacturer partnerships. Reclaim uses a recycling process known as pyrolysis – a thermal deconstruction technique which breaks down and pulls apart PV panels into their component parts by passing them through a high-temperature furnace. Upon completion of the thermal extraction process, the recovered components are sorted and placed into collection bins for delivery to materials companies, ensuring all recoverable materials are available for re-use.
According to the International Renewable Agency, the value of materials from solar module recycling and upcycling will be worth around US$15 billion (AU$21 billion) by the year 2050.
“While the primary aim is to stop all panels from entering landfill, the long-term view for the solar circular economy includes the realisation of community benefits around employment and training and creating the ‘jobs of the future’,” Jones added.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/18/new-zealand-unveils-multibillion-dollar-climate-plan-comes-under-attack-for-staggering-omission/,"EV,FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,NEW ZEALAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 18, 2022","New Zealand unveils multibillion-dollar climate plan, comes under attack for ‘staggering’ omission","On Monday, the New Zealand government announced its plan and budget to cut emissions as it strives for net zero by 2050. The plan received bipartisan support, though it was criticised by minor parties as well as by Greenpeace.
With billions on the table, the plan involves policies to support low and middle-income New Zealanders getting into electric vehicles (EVs), as well as the often overlooked pathway of cutting transport emissions through investing in public transport, bike and footpaths. The budget also dedicates a major tranche of support for the electrification of industry, as well as the further decarbonisation of its already renewable-heavy grid. 
New Zealand has quite a different emissions profile to Australia and inhabits a funny position as simultaneous leader and laggard. Roughly 80% of its electricity is produced from renewable sources thanks to its longstanding hydro and geothermal assets, though renewables account for substantially less of its primary energy mix at 40%.
However, like Australia, New Zealand is among the world’s highest per capita emitters. Moreover, emissions in New Zealand rose by 52% between 1990 and 2020 – a massive increase compared to other nations. The country’s climate policies and actions have been labelled “highly insufficient” by Climate Action Tracker.

Agriculture, forestry and fishing contributes roughly half of New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions. These sectors have largely been omitted from the country’s Zero Carbon Act, where it enshrined its 2050 net zero target in law, sparking criticism which has not been assuaged by the recent budget.
Transport featured as a centrepiece of the New Zealand plan, with NZ$1.2 billion (AU$1.09 billion) being spent on the sector.
The government has unveiled a “scrap and replace” scheme for New Zealanders to replace fossil cars with EVs or hybrids. The government is hoping the policy will get it to its target of zero emissions vehicles accounting for at least 30% of the national car fleet by 2035.
The program is called the Clean Car Upgrade and will initially give 2500 low- and middle-income households a rebate on an EV or hybrid car in exchange for scrapping their old car. Around NZ$30 million (AU$27 million) will be spent on the Clean Car Upgrade trials, which are set to begin next year, with the full program to be established by 2024, costing NZ$570 million (AU$516 million) over four years.

Jacinda Ardern’s government has also pledged NZ$20 million (AU$18 million) to run an EV leasing program allowing low-income families in three communities to lease EVs from community organisations starting next year.
New Zealand is promoting transport decarbonisation by increasing public transport, bike and footpaths too. It plans to bring in zero-emissions buses from 2025 and aims to decarbonise the nation’s entire public transport fleet by 2035.
It will also build at least 100 kilometres of urban bike paths and improve footpaths. 
Around NZ$650 million will also go towards electrifying industry and decarbonising the remainder of the electricity grid. “Emissions from our energy and industry sectors make up 27% of our total emissions,” New Zealand’s Energy Minister Megan Woods said.
To cut those emissions, the government will introduce subsidies for high efficiency electrical equipment, including electric motors and heat pumps. The sale of new low- to medium-temperature coal boilers will also be banned.
International Energy Agency (IEA)
New Zealand uses far less coal than Australia, but its steelmaking and diary industries do still use the fossil fuel. The country is yet to come up with a national energy strategy to phase this use out, but funds have now been allocated to figure out a pathway, as well as for integrating hydrogen.
New Zealand will also beef up its recycling infrastructure and will begin providing roadside food waste collection to stop it going into landfill.
Here is where things start getting contentious, with the government criticised by Greenpeace for promoting “unproven techno fixes” rather than considering measures like, for instance, reducing the number of cows in its vast herds.
It seems as though cows and their diary industries might inhabit a similar position in New Zealand’s cultural consciousness as coal does in Australia. That is, it’s considered an export bedrock and given special standing. 
The government has committed NZ$710 million (AU$643 million) to reducing agricultural emissions, including to abate some of those emissions through reforestation. 
“Our economic security depends on New Zealand’s food and fibre sector,” Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor said. “It’s our biggest export earner but also our largest contributor to emissions, and if we don’t take action now we will be at risk as consumer preferences evolve.”
Specifically, NZ$339 million (AU$307 million) is going towards “the development of high-impact technologies and practices” to reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, which was welcomed by the prominent lobby group Federated Farmers – though it is far from universally liked.
Greenpeace has deemed this element of the plan so problematic that it says it renders the government’s approach “not credible.”
“Instead of just cutting cow numbers, the government is relying on industry promises, hypothetical, and unproven techno fixes to agricultural emissions, and the freshwater reforms that the dairy industry is undermining at every step,” Greenpeace’s lead agriculture campaigner Christine Rose said.
She added it was “absolutely staggering to see that the Emissions Reduction Plan fails to include policy that would reduce cow numbers or phase out the synthetic nitrogen fertiliser that drive emissions.”
“Despite the climate emergency, industrial dairy has yet again been given a free pass that now comes with a huge subsidy from the rest of New Zealand.”

ACE Green Recycling haws said that it will construct a battery recycling facility in Texas that operates on a proprietary emissions-free system. 
The plant is expected to recycle both lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries – the key elements of both electric vehicles and conventional vehicles, energy storage, and mobile devices. Phase one of operations is scheduled for the third quarter, starting with the recycling of lead-acid batteries, followed by the lithium-ion operation, said ACE Green Recycling. By 2025, at full capacity, the facility is expected to process up to 100,000 metric tons of lead-acid batteries and 20,000 metric tons of lithium-ion batteries. 
Battery recycling is typically done by a smelting process that involves extremely high temperatures, often exceeding 1,000 C, while burning expensive and pollutive fossil fuels, and exposing workers to hazardous working conditions.  
Rather than smelting, ACE’s process is fully electrified. The company said this leads to an emissions-free higher battery material yield and a safer workplace environment.
At full operation, the project is expected to recycle more than 5 million lead-acid batteries, abate more than 50,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, reduce landfill dumping of more than 10 million pounds of hazardous solid waste, and recycle more than 15 million pounds of plastics annually. The facility is expected to create 100 Texas-based jobs.
ACE said it is also exploring opportunities to power most of its key plant activities with solar energy to address its Scope 2 emissions. The plant would be truly “emissions-free” if solar PV or other emissions-free generators are used as the sole source of power. 
Due to a lack of sufficient recycling capacity, the US currently exports a large amount of its scrap batteries to Mexico and Asia while importing new materials back, leading to major value losses and an inefficient use of energy to ship these materials around the world. By establishing a large recycling centre in Texas, ACE said it intends to alleviate US dependence on imports. 
“Texas sits at the heart of the world’s global energy revolution with key access to an abundant pool of top engineering and technical talent. ACE’s new facility aims to be part of that revolution and build a greener, more sustainable future for America,” said Nishchay Chadha, ACE’s co-founder and chief executive. 
“We are excited to establish our first North American facility in the state of Texas that will not only generate significant local economic activity but also contribute to a greener environmental footprint,” said Dr Vipin Tyagi, co-founder and chief technology officer. “By contributing to America’s battery recycling capabilities, we also aim to strengthen the country’s energy independence and build a more resilient future for the nation.”
ACE Green Recycling is an American technology company with global operations across Southeast Asia and India. It is set to announce new facilities in Asia, Europe and the Middle East by early 2023.
The announcement follows a US Department of Energy unveiled plan to inject $60 million into second-life opportunities for batteries once used for EVs. The $60 million comes in addition to the $3.1 billion funding for battery manufacturing, processing, and recycling nationwide.
“Positioning the United States front and centre in meeting the growing demand for advanced batteries is how we boost our competitiveness and electrify our transportation system,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “President Biden’s historic investment in battery production and recycling will give our domestic supply chain the jolt it needs to become more secure and less reliant on other nations—strengthening our clean energy economy, creating good paying jobs, and decarbonising the transportation sector.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/18/unsw-researchers-crack-night-time-solar/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BLAKE MATICH,"MAY 18, 2022",UNSW researchers crack ‘night-time’ solar,"Researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) have reported a major breakthrough in the generation of so-called ‘night-time’ solar power, a process previously conceived of only theoretically.  
The breakthrough saw a team from the UNSW School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering generate electricity from heat radiated as infrared light, a mimicking of the same system by which the planet cools itself by radiating heat into space at night. 
Small beginnings
By employing a semiconductor device known as a thermoradiative diode (a similar material composition is found in night-vision goggles), the team was able to generate a small amount of power from the infrared light (approximately 100,000 times less than that produced by a solar panel). 
Though seemingly minor, the research team believes the result is just the beginning. “We have made an unambiguous demonstration of electrical power from a thermoradiative diode,” said team lead Professor Ned Ekins-Daukes, who noted that in theory this technology could ultimately produce a tenth of the power of a solar cell. 
“Using thermal imaging cameras you can see how much radiation there is at night, but just in the infrared rather than the visible wavelengths. What we have done is make a device that can generate electrical power from the emission of infrared thermal radiation.”
Ekins-Daukes said the process is still a harnessing of solar power, for the solar energy had hit the Earth during the day, warming the planet, but instead of that energy radiating back out into space in the form of infrared light, it can now be harvested. 
Phoebe Pearce, one of the co-authors of the research paper published in ACS Photonics, said “Photovoltaics, the direct conversion of sunlight into electricity, is an artificial process that humans have developed in order to convert the solar energy into power. In that sense the thermoradiative process is similar; we are diverting energy flowing in the infrared from a warm Earth into the cold universe.”
“In the same way that a solar cell can generate electricity by absorbing sunlight emitted from a very hot sun,” continued Pearce, “the thermoradiative diode generates electricity by emitting infrared light into a colder environment. In both cases the temperature difference is what lets us generate electricity.”  
The researchers believe the breakthrough could be the beginning of a long path toward devices that could one day capture energy at a much larger scope than currently conceived. 
Indeed, Ekins-Daukes likened the research to that performed by engineers at Bell Labs in 1954 who demonstrated the first practical silicon solar cell. That cell was barely 2% efficient, whereas modern day cells are able to convert around 23% of received sunlight into electricity.

Commercialisation 
Fellow co-author Michael Nielsen noted that despite how far away commercialisation of this technology is, the evolving idea is extremely exciting. 
“By leveraging our knowledge of how to design and optimise solar cells and borrowing materials from the existing mid-infrared photodetector community, we hope for rapid progress towards delivering the dream of solar power at night,” said Nielsen. 
Brave New World 
The scope of potential application for this technology is staggering. One such idea is power from body heat, which would see bionic devices such as artificial hearts powered just from heat generated in the body. 
“Down the line,” said Ekins-Daukes, “this technology could potentially harvest that energy and remove the need for batteries in certain devices – or help to recharge them. That isn’t something where conventional solar power would necessarily be a viable option.” 
While the technology still needs a decade of research in universities, the industry should be prepared to step in and drive advancement by seeing the enormous potential of such an energy gathering tool.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/18/global-annual-solar-deployment-to-hit-1-tw-by-2030/,"MARKETS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MAY 18, 2022",Global annual solar deployment to hit 1 TW by 2030,"From pv magazine USA
If it feels as if the solar industry has crossed a major milestone, that’s because it has. Cumulative industry deployments reached 1 TW of installed capacity sometime in Q1. And now, only a couple of months later, it is time to move on from these accomplishments and ask the industry, “what will you do for us by 2030?”

What is it we are asking for? One terawatt of solar power, installed each and every year, and forever thereafter, starting in 2030.
At InterSolar Munich last week, LONGi Solar, the global leader in solar panel manufacturing, projected that global solar deployment will reach 1 TW per year by 2030.
To elucidate this point, pv magazine USA assembled the chart below based upon BloombergNEF solar photovoltaics deployment data from the year 1980 through 2021. The vertical axis shows the amount of growth in each year versus the three years prior.

Based on 1980’s deployment volume of 7 MW divided by 1983’s volume of 20 MW, we saw 286% growth – almost tripling the deployed capacity in three years. This is an average that saw “slower,” 127% to 286% growth in the 1983 to 2003 period, which turned into explosive 224% to 661% growth from 2004 to 2013, before settling into 156% to 224% growth from 2014 through to the present.
The trend line shows that we’ve slowly been increasing deployment growth rates since 1980, and if we were to have actually doubled our deployment volume every three years since that 7 MW built in the 1980s, we would have built somewhere between 100 and 114 GWdc of capacity in 2021, instead of the ~183 GW which was actually deployed.
Looking at these numbers, it is easy to see how LONGi and others have arrived at their projections.
Several industry analyst groups have reported that global solar deployment in 2021 totals 150 MW of capacity versus BloombergNEF’s 183 GW. Starting with the lowest estimate, and assuming that installed capacity continues to double every three years, the capacity deployed in the near future will be immense:
Alternatively, if we start with the 183 GW deployment predicted by the venerable BloombergNEF team, we arrive at nearly 1.5 TW of yearly deployments in 2030.
Starting with the highest estimates, based on the energy war boosted 230 to 250 GW deployments forecast for 2022, we see 1 TW per year being deployed as soon as 2028.
Naysayers may claim that these estimates are simply a sales story from a company that seeks to sell more solar panels. That is a logical conclusion, but let’s consider another, more practical explanation. Perhaps this sales story comes from informed manufacturers and developers, readying their companies for the inevitable whirlwind of market demand.
This author sees the story of intense industry growth as a warning, not an advertisement. Perhaps by examining some corollary data we can confirm the story.
SolarPower Europe released their Global Market Outlook (GMO) for 2022 through 2025 capacity projections in time for the InterSolar conference. In just three years, SolarPower Europe predicts global solar deployments will more than double, to 2.3 TW in 2025.

Below, SolarPower Europe shares their historical GMO capacity projections, and how they’ve changed as deployment has sped up versus their seemingly ‘conservative’ projections.
The group’s middle-of-the-road growth scenario now points to 283 GW of solar power being deployed in 2024. This projection has increased several times, from 200 GW in 2020 to 239 GW in 2021 and it now sits at 283 GW.
One might reasonably assume that SolarPower Europe could increase their 2024 projections once more in 2023, and then again in 2024, possibly reaching 300 GW. That would fit right in with the anticipated 1 TW per year by 2030.

Skepticism appears warranted, and we can already hear our critics saying, “Predictions are easy, show me the factories!”
Can do.
Just two weeks ago, Tongwei said they sought to have up to one million metric tons of polysilicon manufacturing capacity by the end of 2026.
It was only a few years ago that global solar manufacturing produced ‘only’ 500,000 metric tons of the product. Now, on a timeline of only four years, we’re seeing plans for one company to potentially double the world’s capacity.
There have also been dramatic reductions to the amount of polysilicon required to manufacture solar panels. Only a few years ago, solar panels needed 4 to 5 grams of polysilicon to make one watt of solar power, supporting 100 to 125 GW of capacity deployed.
Today’s solar technology requires only 3 grams of polysilicon to produce that same watt. Technology has advanced so quickly that even this 3 grams per watt figure may be a conservative estimate.
Thus, by 2026, one million metric tons of polysilicon should be expected to support 333 GW of solar module manufacturing capacity. That’s a third of our terawatt needs, and about half of our 2027 medium-growth estimate of 600 GW.
Of course, Tongwei is not the only company seeking to massively expand their polysilicon capacity. LONGi Solar and others have made similar announcements. They are only two of several manufacturers readying themselves to meet demand and stay in control.
It’s time for us solar professionals to prepare ourselves, as well.

Tata Power Solar has secured a 300 MW solar project in India from state-owned hydropower producer NHPC, following a recent 1 GW win from SJVN.
The 300 MW project, worth INR 1,731 crore (AU$317 million), will be developed in Rajasthan under the Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) scheme. Under the CPSU scheme, state-run power producers are provided financial support to set up solar plants for self-use or for use by other government entities, either directly or through electricity distribution companies.
The CPSU scheme mandates the use of domestic solar cells and modules. It provides viability gap funding to cover the cost difference between domestic and imported solar cells and modules.
The project is scheduled for commissioning within 18 months from the award of the contract. Once operational, it is expected to generate approximately 750 million units of electricity per year. With this win, Tata Power’s pending order book has reached INR 13,500 crore (AU$2.5 million), and its total utility-scale solar project portfolio has hit 9.7 GWp.
