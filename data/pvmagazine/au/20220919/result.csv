https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/19/todd-proposes-400-mw-solar-farm-for-new-zealands-north-island/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW ZEALAND",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 19, 2022",Todd proposes 400 MW solar farm for New Zealand’s North Island,"Todd Generation, through subsidiary Nova Energy, plans to build what would be New Zealand’s largest solar farm on a 1,022-hectare dairy farm on the North Island but first the developer must clear a final hurdle.
After lodging land-use consents with the Taupō District Council and the Bay of Plenty Regional Council earlier this year seeking permission to convert the farmland into a solar facility, Todd Generation will have its application heard by an independent resource consent commissioner on Wednesday.
Todd Generation said, subject to a final investment decision to be made after the consenting process, it plans to “break ground on the 150 MW stage 1 in 2023, with operations commencing approximately 18 months later”.
The ~$530 million (NZ$600 million) project would comprise approximately 900,000 solar panels arranged across the 1,022-hectare site at Rangitāiki, about 35 kilometres southeast of Taupō. The company is also seeking approval to construct 98 centralised inverters, a switchyard, and transmission lines to connect the project to the national grid.
The Taupō solar farm is to be built in stages with all three phases expected to be completed and the facility fully operational by the last quarter of 2027.
Todd Generation said when complete, the project will generate about 650,000 MWh of clean energy per annum, contributing an approximate 1% increase to New Zealand’s renewable electricity generation capacity, enough to satisfy the electricity demands of approximately 100,000 homes.
“The Rangitāiki solar power plant represents a significant investment in New Zealand’s future renewable energy supply,” the company said.
Todd Generation projects and developments manager Christopher Pye said the proposed Taupō project will provide a significant contribution to the development of large-scale solar capacity in New Zealand and provide diversification of the country’s renewable electricity portfolio.
“Solar generation of meaningful scale does not yet exist in New Zealand,” he said. “However deployment is well demonstrated overseas and decades of experience now exist within the sector.
“New Zealand is now well placed to develop and operate high-quality solar electricity generation assets, building on the 10-plus years of experience in nearby Australia in particular.”

While solar presently makes up less than 0.5% of electricity generation in New Zealand, the Climate Change Commission has estimated that the technology will need to grow to an estimated 19 GW and contribute 20% of electricity supply by 2050 for New Zealand to meet its net-zero carbon targets.
The Taupō project would be far and away the largest solar farm in New Zealand. It dwarfs the country’s largest existing solar farm, the 2.1 MW Kapuni plant in Taranaki, which is operated by Nova Energy and is more than double the capacity of a 150 MW farm being constructed at Christchurch Airport.
The Taupō project is one of a handful of utility scale solar farm projects in the pipeline across the country.
In April, Helios Energy, formed by a group of United States and New Zealand entrepreneurs, announced it would pursue grid-scale solar developments in New Zealand.
That announcement was followed by New Zealand’s Contact Energy teaming with Lightsource bp, the renewables arm of Britain-based BP, to announce plans develop a large-scale solar portfolio.
A month later German investment manager Aquila Capital partnered with Auckland-based renewables developer Far North Solar Farm (FNSF) to develop an estimated $1 billion suite of large-scale solar PV projects across New Zealand’s North and South islands.

FTC Solar, which has been active in the Australian market since establishing an office in 2019, said Pioneer’s proprietary design reduces piles by 18% or more, delivering capital and labour cost reductions. It also features shorter row length that reportedly enables higher energy density for a given block of land.
“Pioneer achieves a full 18%-36% pile count reduction per megawatt versus the current industry-leading solutions by volume,” FTC chief technology officer Nagendra Cherukupalli said.
“And with a high-density design, Pioneer enables up to 5% greater energy output for the same site compared to the competition.”
Designed for utility-scale installations, the Pioneer tracking system accommodates 550 W and 600 W wide-format modules. FTC said the system supports all module factors, including those over 2.4 meters in length.
In addition, the company said no torque tube (TT) dimpling or through-bolts are required to index the module to the TT, allowing for module changes and retrofits. FTC said Pioneer’s distinctive TT shape allows for longer spans, improved torsional rigidity, and positive alignment of components without the need for penetrations.
FTC said the Pioneer system accommodates a 17.5% slope while zero-degree stow allows for reduced pile embedment depth. The design also allows the use of ground screw mounting systems to overcome challenging sub-surface conditions.
The tracker will operate independently from the grid during outages and is self-powered with battery back-up for up to three days.
The 500 MW agreement, signed with U.S.-based developer Primoris Renewable Energy, stipulates that FTC will supply its solar tracker technology for multiple project sites in the U.S. Primoris is expected to use the new Pioneer 1P tracker technology on multiple projects.
The Pioneer tracking system will make it public debut at the annual RE+ Power show in California this week. No details about when the Pioneer will be available in Australia have yet been provided.

The system will incorporate a 4.9 MW solar farm to be built onsite, a 5.4 MWh battery system, inverter, grid stability unit, microgrid controller and communications, and an estimated 7 kilometres of new underground powerlines.
AGL, which will build, own and operate the solar-storage microgrid under a long-term power purchase agreement, said it will provide 5.2 GWh of renewable energy to the site, reducing Cadell Orchard’s reliance on existing diesel-fuelled generators and slashing the orchard’s carbon emissions by up to 4,700 tonnes a year.
David Armstrong, chief executive of Australian Farming Services which manages Cadell Orchards, said the 1,690-hectare property is not connected to the grid, instead relying on electric pumps that are currently powered by diesel generators for all irrigation needs.
“Working with AGL, we’ll be able to generate clean and renewable solar power which will cut our emissions, reduce our reliance on diesel fuel by 85% and deliver up to 40% energy cost savings each year,” he said.
“Our orchard will also benefit from energy price certainty and better energy resilience and reliability.”
AGL chief customer officer Jo Egan said the company has been working with Cadell Orchards to model energy usage and design an integrated renewable energy system to lower their energy costs and to create a more sustainable farming operation.
“This is AGL’s second major microgrid announcement this year and a great example of how AGL is partnering with agribusinesses to help them reduce their carbon emissions and lower their energy costs,” she said.
“AGL is committed to renewable energy and it’s through partnerships like this that we’re delivering on a low-carbon future with our customers and communities as we transition towards net-zero.”
Installation of the new microgrid is due to start in April 2023 and is expected to provide electricity by October 2023.

NSW Fair Trading Commissioner Natasha Mann said the contractor licences were cancelled by the state government department’s Disciplinary Action Unit (DAU) between March and August. Each of the electricians was also disqualified from working in the NSW building industry for varying periods of time.
In one of the cases, the individual signed off on 161 solar panel installations that were carried out across NSW while he was interstate.
“The man took advantage of the Commonwealth Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme and received tens of thousands in government rebates for installations that he did not install or inspect himself,” she said.
He was one of six of the electricians who were either interstate or overseas on the dates listed on the certificates. The seventh contractor was in Sydney instead of at the job sites in regional NSW.
“We are warning NSW consumers who are getting solar panels installed to check that the person on the roof attending to the wiring is a licensed electrician with the credentials required to work in this state and carry out solar panel installations,” Mann said.
Mann said in NSW the tradesperson installing a solar panel on any site should to be able to show the customer a contractor licence in the category of Electrician and a Clean Energy Council (CEC) accreditation.
CEC provisions require solar installers wishing to claim government rebates to provide a visual record of site attendance across the life of eligible projects.
The announcement by NSW Fair Trading comes after the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) confirmed it had executed search warrants on several residential and commercial addresses connected to a Perth-based solar PV retail and installation business as part of an investigation into a potential $1.5 million solar panel fraud.
The CER said on Friday that a Western Australian solar PV company is under investigation for allegedly fabricating information about the responsible installer and designer of the almost 500 solar panel installations.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/19/new-grid-scale-lfp-battery-from-canadian-solar/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 19, 2022",New grid-scale LFP battery from Canadian Solar,"Canadian Solar will this week launch a utility-scale lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) battery with a 2.8 MWh energy capacity. LFP chemistry is hailed for cutting the risk of thermal runway, or fires, that can be problematic in other lithium-based battery systems.
Called the SolBank, the system is designed for safety, reliability, and bankability. The battery enclosure contains liquid cooling mechanisms and humidity control, and active balancing battery management systems. The company said the technology complies with the latest international safety standards.
Canadian Solar’s majority owned subsidiary CSI Energy Storage produces the unit in Jiangsu Province, China. The current annual battery manufacturing output capacity is 2.5 GWh and is expected to reach 10 GWh by the end of 2023.
CSI Energy Storage also provides full commissioning and integration services, turnkey engineering, procurement, and construction project execution and long-term operational service and capacity maintenance. As of Q2 2022, the company’s system integration total pipeline reached 11 GWh, including 861 MWh under long-term service agreements, 1.9 GWh under construction or contracted and an additional earlier stage pipeline of 8.2 GWh.
“Our manufacturing capacity in battery storage will spur the continued growth of our battery storage solutions business, which will in turn enhance the synergies with our battery storage project development business,” said Dr. Shawn Qu, chair and CEO of Canadian Solar. “Solar plus battery storage will be one of the key solutions to combat climate change.”
The announcement comes after Canadian Solar recently unveiled an all-in-one residential battery and hybrid inverter, called the EP Cube
One unit can scale from 9.9 kWh to 19.9 kWh in capacity, and up to six units can be connected in parallel, achieving 119.9 kWh of storage and 45.6 kW output, said the company. This is more than enough to fully power the average home with high-surge-current appliances and AC units.
EP Cube is designed to be lightweight and easy to install, featuring all-inclusive components and self-configuration for fast commissioning. Each battery module weighs less than 70 lbs., significantly lower than many residential units, which can weigh upwards of 300 lbs. The battery module measures only 6.25 inches thick and is NEMA 4X rated for both indoor and outdoor use.
The battery is compatible with the EP Cube app, which allows homeowners to monitor production and consumption in real time. Homeowners have access to their energy management through the app, and installers use the app to set up and troubleshoot the system. Updates are made remotely to the battery management system.
Over the past two decades, Canadian Solar has delivered over 76 GW of solar modules to customers across the world. Since entering the project development business in 2010, the company has developed, built and connected over 6.8 GW in over 20 countries across the world. Currently, the company has about 311 MW of solar projects in operation, 5.3 GW of projects under construction or in backlog (late-stage), and an additional 21 GW of projects in pipeline (mid- to early-stage).

It did not disclose the financial terms of the deal.
“The agreement increases the energy storage capacity of Prime Infra’s renewable energy portfolio by 6,000MWh/day which is defined by a maximum continuous generation at 500MW for 12 hours,” said Prima Infra CEO Guillaume Lucci.
The facility will require an investment of approximately $1 billion and will be located at the Wawa/Montalban dam in Rizal province. Construction is scheduled to start next year.
In 2017, OVWPI awarded the engineering, procurement and construction contract for the project to Power Construction Corp. of China (PowerChina). At the time, the project was being developed by San Lorenzo Ruiz Builders and Developers (SLRB) and Equis Energy (Equis).
Prime Infra is also developing a 1,400 MW pumped storage hydropower project in Pakil, Laguna province. Construction of the $1.11 billion project is scheduled to begin in 2023, with completion set for no later than the first quarter of 2027. The first stage of the project will feed 700 MW of electricity into the grid for primary and tertiary reserve ancillary services, while the second stage will generate 500 MW for mid-merit services.
Prime Infra is also building a 2.5 GW to 3.5 GW solar farm tied to 4 GWh to 4.5 GWh of battery energy storage, in order to help power the Philippines, as the nation ramps up its transition to renewable energy.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Philippines had around 3,785 MW of hydropower capacity and 736 MW of pumped hydro capacity at the end of 2021. The government aims to increase the share of renewables in the power mix from 21% in 2020 to 35% by 2030 and 50% by 2040. Renewables currently account for 29.1% of the nation’s total installed capacity.
