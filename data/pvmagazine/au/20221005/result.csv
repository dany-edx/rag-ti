The announcement is far from explicit, but it seems BESS Research will procure CellCube’s licensed technology, componentry, and services for a vanadium redox flow battery with a capacity of 2 MWh to 8MWh. This battery will then be used in a process of research and development (R&D) to finesse the technology to “meet the Australian market’s wide-ranging uses.”
Once this research is successfully completed, the companies say they expect to release “localised” CellCube systems for Australian clients in the second half of 2023 “for trialling across a number of sites with a variety of harsh and complex Australian weather conditions.”

“The objective is to predominantly support industrial and commercial microgrid systems where customers are seeking to enhance their renewable generation with long-duration energy storage (4+ hours),” the media releases says.
Vanadium redox flow battery technology was first developed at the University of New South Wales in 1980s, but struggled to get off the ground commercially. 
The decarbonisation of global energy systems, however, has refreshed interest in the technology which is more durable, better able to weather harsh climates and can offer longer duration storage than lithium-based batteries. While these features and histories would seemingly make flow batteries particularly attractive in Australia, to date they have primarily been deployed in South Africa and China.
BESS Research, which states its objective as “breaking down the barriers limiting Australian industries’ adoption of large-scale vanadium redox flow batteries” is eager to see the Australian opportunity realised though – albeit belatedly. 
To that end, the BESSS Research and CellCube partnership will also include Western Australian membrane technology company Nanomem Solutions Limited as it seeks to improve the existing proton exchange membranes used in redox flow batteries. 
Nanomem Solutions is also set to secure local vanadium electrolyte sources in Australia.

Back in 2020, Enerox CellCube actually signed an agreement with Australian Vanadium Limited – which is developing one of Australia’s biggest vanadium projects. That agreement specifically included the supply of vanadium electrolyte, and it’s unclear whether it has been voided or will be ongoing as Enerox CellCube tries to gain a foothold in Australia.
Either way, Enerox CellCube is eager to promote Andrew McKee, who it describes as a vanadium industry “pioneer” having co-developed Australia’s first and only vanadium mine and processing plant at Windimurra, Western Australia.
“We are facing a high demand for double-digit megawatt storage systems in remote areas,” McKee, who is now the managing director at Nanomem, says. 
“Australian customers want to see a successful proof of concept project with a megawatt battery storage delivering power and energy for multiple hours – a complete storage technology covered by bankable performance guarantees and with the ability to leverage finance through PPAs.
“We have engaged with R&D provider BESS to perform the functionalisation for Australian conditions on the VRFB technology. 
“A stationary battery with large and quick dispatchability shifting energy without degradation is the missing link for our renewable future. Our partner CellCube is the global VRFB leader for this microgrid application, and BESS/CellCube will provide this piece of the puzzle that makes 24/7 renewable power possible,” McKee adds.
In the announcement, Alexander Schoenfeldt, CEO of CellCube also highlighted the renewed focus from Australian governments on developing local battery manufacturing and supply chains. 
“This cooperation follows our business strategy to establish regional offerings and working with local supply chain partners to build megawatt microgrids in our key markets,” Schoenfeldt said.

“As started in North America and South Africa, we are now keen to start business in Australia and, as such, mobilising key staff to build local knowledge and teams and value in Australia for the Australian market.”
Just in the last week, a number of Australian state governments, including in Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales, have taken steps towards realising more renewable energy storage projects – often foreshadowing the need for long duration storage, though currently pumped hydro is touted as the solution of choice.
There are a number of vanadium projects in development in Australia today, including from Australian Vanadium Limited, a Western Australian company, which is seeking to establish both a vanadium mine and commercial vanadium battery electrolyte manufacturing capability within Western Australia. 
Another West Australian company, TNG, is also developing a vanadium project which is claims is the country’s most advanced. Its Mount Peake Project in the Northern Territory also includes a mine and a vanadium processing facility – but the company’s leadership is currently embroiled in a dramatic fight initiated by shareholders. It remains to be seen whether it will disrupt the timelines on the company’s flagship project.
Despite having a relatively low uptake of flow batteries, Brisbane company Redflow, which uses a zinc-bromine makeup for its flow batteries rather than vanadium, is currently having considerable successes pushing into the US market.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/05/how-to-ensure-the-worlds-largest-pumped-hydro-dam-isnt-a-disaster-for-queenslands-environment/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,PUMPED HYDRO,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",,"OCTOBER 5, 2022",How to ensure the world’s largest pumped-hydro dam isn’t a disaster for Queensland’s environment,"While it sounds high-tech, it’s very simple: take two dams at different elevations. Pump water to the top dam when cheap renewables are flooding the grid. Run the water down the slope and through turbines to make power at night or when the wind isn’t blowing.
When dams are built badly, however, they can trash the environment. For two decades, I’ve pointed out the environmental destruction conventional dams can cause. But now we urgently need more pumped hydro dams to enable Australia’s transition to fully renewable power.
Queensland’s huge new renewable energy plan relies heavily on two massive pumped hydro projects. Inland from the Sunshine Coast is Borumba Dam, which could deliver two gigawatts of 24-hour storage by 2030. This was first proposed last year. The new proposal is Pioneer-Burdekin, west of Mackay, which is intended to store five gigawatts of 24-hour storage from the 2030s. It would involve relocating residents of the small town of Netherdale, which would be inundated.
For consumers, this means energy reliability. Each gigawatt of stored power could supply around two million homes – and Queensland has around two million households.

Environmentally, the good news is we can learn from previous mistakes and build this vital infrastructure carefully to minimise local environmental damage and maximise the broader environmental benefit of quitting coal power.
Solar and wind power can produce vast quantities of cheap power – but not all the time. Pumped hydro is one way to store renewable energy when it’s being generated and releasing it later when needed.
While grid-scale batteries such as Victoria’s Big Battery have drawn plenty of media coverage, they are better at storing smaller amounts of electricity and releasing it quickly. Pumped hydro is slightly slower to start feeding back to the grid, but big facilities can keep generating power for days.
Renewable fuels such as green hydrogen and ammonia may be available in the future, but not now. Nuclear energy is very expensive and would take decades to build. Batteries cannot meet supply gaps longer than a few hours, and come with environmental costs from the mining of raw materials, manufacture, and recycling and disposal of toxic materials.
That leaves pumped hydro as a vital option – especially on cold, still and overcast days in winter when solar and wind produce very little electricity.

Conventional hydropower dams destroy river ecosystems and flood forests, towns and prime farm land. Globally, the hydropower industry anticipates expanding by 60% by 2050 to provide renewable electricity and storage.
I’m less worried about pumped hydro, for three reasons.
First, the two reservoirs can be built away from rivers. This alone greatly reduces the damage done by damming rivers and flooding fertile valleys.
Second, the area flooded is generally an order of magnitude smaller than conventional hydropower. This is because the great elevation difference between the two reservoirs may enable more power to be generated from limited water.
And third, pumped hydro doesn’t need much extra water once filled, as the water cycles around. A little topping up to replace losses from evaporation and seepage is all that’s needed.
More than 3,000 potential sites for pumped hydro have been identified in Australia. Importantly, these are all outside formal nature reserves and mostly located along the Great Dividing Range. We’d only need around 20 of these sites to be developed to store power for the nation. That’s around the same number currently planned, built or under construction in Tasmania, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland.
Nearly all large renewable energy developments meet local opposition based on non-financial values. Opponents of big pumped hydro developments such as Snowy 2.0 have called for other sites to be developed instead.
If we took this approach, however, we could multiply the environmental disruption. That’s because Snowy 2.0, as well as the proposed Borumba and Pioneer-Burdekin projects in Queensland are huge. They could each generate up to ten times more power than most of the other projects being planned elsewhere.
Shifting elsewhere could mean many more smaller projects, which means more roads, transmission lines and reservoirs.
Environmental disruption from pumped hydro differs greatly depending on the site.
At the site selection stage, it’s vital to avoid areas of high conservation and Indigenous cultural value.
We can limit environmental damage by using existing dams, as we’re seeing at Snowy 2.0. Old mines in the right locations can have a second life as pumped hydro, as the Kidston project in Queensland demonstrates.
By using existing dams or mines, we can actually begin repairing past damage, such as by improving old dams to boost environmental flows.
That’s not to say damage won’t be done. Pumped hydro has been linked to the introduction of diseases affecting wildlife, as well as invasive plant and animal species.
Roads and transmission lines are one of the biggest impacts on the natural world. By my calculations, much more habitat will be cleared for the Snowy 2.0 overhead transmission lines (around 9,600 hectares) than the new hydro scheme road and pipeline access and waste rock disposal (around 1,000 hectares).
We could dramatically reduce environmental damage and visual clutter by putting the lines underground, or building close to existing power lines.
So, the choice is ours. While pumped hydro is a lot less damaging than traditional hydroelectricity, it will cause some environmental damage.
That’s why pumped hydro developers must choose sites and build carefully, to minimise environmental damage and maximise the benefits of storage. After all, this technology offers the enormous environmental good of freeing ourselves from the need to burn coal, gas and oil every hour of every day.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/05/neoen-completes-financing-for-its-canberra-big-battery/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 5, 2022",Neoen completes financing for its Canberra big battery,"The owner and operator of Australia’s two biggest batteries, Neoen, is close to switching on its third – the Capital Battery beside the Queanbeyan substation in Canberra’s southeast.
The Capital Battery will be owned by Neoen, and financed through a combination of company equity and loans from infrastructure fund manager Infradebt as well as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC). It is the third investment CEFC has made in Neoen’s Australian big batteries.
The Capital Battery is also set to deliver grid support services to the network, Neoen says, presumably through what’s known as virtual synchronous machines or grid forming inverters, which gives batteries the capacity to help stabilise the grid by providing inertia.
This is something the company’s 150 MW / 193.5 MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve, AKA the South Australian Big Battery, began doing at scale in July 2022 following two years of trials.

The Capital Battery is Neoen’s first project with South Korean technology partner Doosan. The two big batteries Neoen already operates, the 300 MW / 450 MWh Victorian Big Battery near Geelong, and the Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia, have both used Tesla technology. The Doosan partnership was announced shortly after the Victorian Big Battery caught fire during commissioning.
Also helping underpin the Capital Battery’s finances is a 70 MW “virtual battery contract” Neoen entered with utility giant AGL Energy back in April 2022. Lasting seven years, Neoen described the new type of contract as a financial agreement and a hedging tool.
“The virtual battery [agreement] is an innovative solution designed by Neoen to allow a large electricity user or retailer to mimic a grid-scale battery, without having to build or own one,” Neoen said of the AGL contract. “This highly flexible solution provides AGL Energy with the ability to hedge its customer load by virtually charging and discharging a battery of 70 MW as and when it chooses.”
Neoen has said it hopes the virtual battery concept will become one of its core products in future. 

It is likely the AGL agreement is behind the doubling of the Capital Battery’s capacity, which has grown from the initial 50 MW / 100 MWh project outlined by Neoen in its 2020 tender with the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) government.
The Capital Battery was part of Neoen’s winning bid in the Territory’s renewable energy auction that year, where it was awarded a 14-year contract to supply 100 MW of wind energy to the ACT government from Stage 1 of its Goyder Renewables Zone, which included the battery plan.
The Goyder Renewables Zone is another flagship project currently being developed by Neoen – a hybrid wind, solar and storage project located near Burra in South Australia’s mid north.
Construction of the Capital Battery began in late 2022. Once the battery is operational sometime in the first half of 2023, Neoen says it will launch a “Community Co-investment Scheme,” providing local residents an opportunity to become financial stakeholders in the project. This specification was part of Neoen’s winning bid in the ACT Renewable Auction in 2020.
Neoen has the biggest portfolio of operational and planned utility-scale batteries. in Australia today – sitting at 576 MW. In late 2022n the company announced plans for 300MW and 800 MWh battery in Blyth, north of Adelaide. 
Image: Neoen
The company is aiming to have a grid-scale battery in each of the five states participating in the National Electricity Market – something it is well on its way to achieving with the Capital Battery making three of five.
The strategy is proving highly profitable for the company. In August 2022, Neoen announced storage revenues had grown by more than one third in the last year thanks to its Australian battery assets – specifically its Victorian Big Battery coming online coupled with Australia’s energy crisis.
Neoen’s first-half 2022 consolidated revenue totalled $328 million (USD 212 million), up 36% compared to the first six months of 2021, according to its most recent earnings report.

The trial seeks to demonstrate the commercial use case of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCV) and was described by PepsiCo’s regional sustainability manager, Brent Gapes, as “a first” for the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry. 
In addition to supplying the truck, Pure Hydrogen will also provide additional hydrogen fuel as required, including refuelling along with arranging repair and maintenance services.
Under the trial agreement, Pure Hydrogen is expected to receive $98,400 (excluding GST, [USD 63,600]) for the supply of the single HFCV truck over the six months trial. If successful, PepsiCo will have the option to lease the truck from Pure Hydrogen at monthly fee of $10,554 (excluding GST) over a potential seven-year term.
Such an agreement, Pure Hydrogen says, presents another revenue opportunity for the company. 
If PepsiCo does not choose to keep the truck at the end of the trial, Pure Hydrogen say they will lease it to another potential customer. It expects its net cost from the trial will sit around $410,000.
It is not the only such endeavour Pure Hydrogen is pursuing. Earlier this year, it announced its partnership with Australia’s largest privately-owned waste management company, JJ Waste & Recycling. As part of that trial, Pure Hydrogen agreed to lease the waste company hydrogen-powered garbage trucks, promising to have the trucks in the streets of southern Queensland before 2022 is out. 
At the time, Pure Hydrogen said it intended to use hydrogen vehicle company H2X Global, in which it has acquired a 24% stake, to “assist in the assembly of the truck.” It should be noted that the same investment firm, Liberty Energy Capital, is behind both H2X and Pure Hydrogen. Liberty is H2X’s primary shareholder and owns at 30% stake in Pure Hydrogen.
Questions around how relevant hydrogen technology will be for transport remain, especially since electric vehicle technologies are far more mature, making them cheaper and visible today. Another oft cited catch is the fact you need to generate twice as much electricity to produce hydrogen than if you just straight up charged an electric vehicle. However, hydrogen for heavy haulage, including for aviation and shipping, has gained traction though the question of trucking is far from settled.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/05/how-long-do-residential-energy-storage-batteries-last-2/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,QUALITY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 5, 2022",How long do residential energy storage batteries last?,"From pv magazine USA
In the first two parts of this series, pv magazine reviewed the productive lifespan of residential solar panels and inverters. Now, we examine home batteries, how well they perform over time, and how long they last.
Residential energy storage has become an increasingly popular feature of home solar. A recent SunPower survey of more than 1,500 households found that about 40% of Americans worry about power outages on a regular basis. Of the survey respondents actively considering solar for their homes, 70% said they planned to include a battery energy storage system.
Besides providing backup power during outages, many batteries are integrated with technology that allows for intelligent scheduling of the import and export of energy. The idea here is to maximise the value of the home’s solar system. And, some batteries are optimised to integrate an electric vehicle charger.
Although deployment of energy storage is on a steady climb, attachment rates of batteries remain low. In 2020, 8.1% of residential solar systems attached batteries, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL).
Many options exist with multiple battery chemistries available for home energy storage. But the bottom line is that in the United States, two brands dominate the space. More than 90% of the market is served by LG Chem and Tesla Powerwall, which are lithium-ion batteries, according to LBL. Tesla has more than 60% of the entire market share.
The Tesla PowerWall has a limited warranty that says the device will be free from defects for 10 years following installation. It also warrants that the PowerWall will start its life with a capacity of 13.5 kWh, and will retain energy capacity based on a degradation schedule.
LG says that its system will retain at least 60% of its nominal energy capacity (9.8 kWh) for 10 years. The battery must operate between -10 C and 45 C to remain covered by warranty. Total throughput of energy within the warranty is limited to 27.4 MWh.
Battery life
Solar installer Sunrun said batteries can last anywhere between five to 15 years. That means a replacement likely will be needed during the 20 to 30 year life of a solar system.
Battery life expectancy is mostly driven by usage cycles. As demonstrated by the LG and Tesla product warranties, thresholds of 60% or 70% capacity are warranted through a certain number of charge cycles.
Two use-scenarios drive this degradation: over charge and trickle charge, said the Faraday Institute. Overcharge is the act of pushing current into a battery that is fully charged. Doing this can cause it to overheat, or even potentially catch fire.
Trickle charge involves a process in which the battery is continually charged up to 100%, and inevitably losses take place. The bounce between 100% and just under 100% can elevate internal temperatures, diminishing capacity and lifetime.
Another cause of degradation over time is the loss of mobile lithium-ions in the battery, said Faraday. Side reactions in the battery can trap free usable lithium, thereby lowering capacity gradually.
While cold temperatures can halt a lithium-ion battery from performing, they do not actually degrade the battery or shorten its effective life. Overall battery lifetime is, however, diminished at high temperatures, said Faraday. This is because the electrolyte that sits between the electrodes breaks down at elevated temperatures, causing the battery to lose its capacity for Li-ion shuttling. This can reduce the number of Li-ions the electrode can accept into its structure, depleting the lithium-ion battery capacity.
Maintenance matters
It is recommended by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to install a battery in a cool, dry place, preferably a garage, where the impact of a fire (a small, but non-zero threat) may be minimised. Batteries and components around them should have proper spacing to allow cooling, and regular maintenance check-ups can be helpful in ensuring optimal operation.
NREL said that whenever possible, avoid repeated deep discharging of batteries, as the more it is discharged, the shorter the lifetime. If the home battery is discharged deeply every day, it may be time to increase the battery bank’s size.
Batteries in series should be kept at the same charge, said NREL. Though the entire battery bank may display an overall charge of 24 volts, there can be varied voltage among the batteries, which is less beneficial to protecting the entire system over the long run. Additionally, NREL recommended that the correct voltage set points are set for chargers and charge controllers, as determined by the manufacturer.
Inspections should occur frequently, too, said NREL. Some things to look for include leakage (buildup on the outside of the battery), appropriate fluid levels, and equal voltage. NREL said each battery manufacturer may have additional recommendations, so checking maintenance and data sheets on a battery is a best practice.

Sodium-ion batteries offer considerable advantages in terms of raw material costs and safety, but manufacturing costs need to fall further in order for them to compete on par with the ubiquitous lithium-ion chemistry, particularly in stationary and large-scale storage applications.
To drive down cell prices as much as possible, researchers at City of Scientific Research and Technological Applications in Alexandria, Egypt, have developed a new synthesis method for sodium-ion battery cathodes that greatly reduces the cost and time needed for each preparation step.
Using Egyptian rice straw ash as a microwave absorber, the researchers synthesised, crystallised, and carbon-coated mixtures of sodium iron phosphates-carbon composites (NaFePO4-C).
The sodium ion electroactive composites were prepared using different microwave heating durations, ranging from 30 to 100 seconds. According to the researchers, the optimum synthesis time was just 60 seconds for applications in sodium-ion batteries, and as a supercapacitor.
They said that high-purity inert gases were not needed during synthesis, processing, or cell assembly, resulting in lower costs.
“The time and cost of energy consumed for the synthesis are incomparable,” said the researchers in “Ultra-fast green microwave assisted synthesis of NaFePO4 -C nanocomposites for sodium ion batteries and supercapacitors” which was recently published in Nature.
