But the final agreement – met with an ovation – includes a first call for nations to transition away from fossil fuels. It’s a step short of a commitment to phasing the fuels out, as some delegates had pushed for. But the development suggests the days of fossil fuels are numbered.
The overriding question the world now faces is whether the broad commitments nations agreed to are enough as climate change gathers pace. The answer, alarmingly, is no.
This year’s talks were controversial from the start.
The role of oil man Sultan Al Jaber as COP28 president fuelled concerns about the hosting role of the United Arab Emirates – a country with significant interests in sustaining a fossil fuel economy. Then came reports Al Jaber had questioned the scientific rationale for phasing out fossil fuels to tackle climate change, amid reports of fossil fuel trade negotiations on the sidelines of negotiations.
On top of this, unprecedented numbers of fossil fuel lobbyists and geoengineering advocates attended the talks. This did not create the ideal conditions for action on climate change.

To their credit, the organisers had an early win with an agreement to establish a “loss and damage” fund whereby richer nations compensate poorer nations for the effects of climate change. The creation of this fund is one of the big outcomes of the talks. It’s taken a long time to get here, after initially being suggested by Vanuatu in 1991 and supported in principle in last year’s talks in Egypt.
Why is it needed? Because developing states are particularly vulnerable to the damage done by climate change, and have limited ability to meet the cost of repair and rebuilding. The fund also points to the particular obligations of developed states and significant emitters who have largely caused the problem.
But there are still big questions about the measure – most importantly, how well it will be funded. Despite the fanfare, just US$700 million has been committed so far to the fund aimed at compensating states for damage that, according to recent estimates, already runs into the hundreds of billions per year.
There are also concerns over having the fund administrated by the World Bank, which has questionable environmental credentials and a patchy record on transparency.
Of course, the fund itself is an admission of failure. It’s needed only because the international community has failed to stop climate change from happening, and is unlikely to prevent it reaching dangerous levels.
As the talks went on, they got harder. The tricky topic: fossil fuels. It may amaze outsiders, but this, the 28th annual climate talks, is the first time nations have directly addressed phasing out fossil fuels. Last year, nations agreed to accelerate the exit from coal – the dirtiest fuel – but said nothing of gas or oil.
For days, debate raged over whether to apply phrases such as “phasing out” or “phasing down” or the term “unabated” to fossil fuels. Even the word “could” became controversial, when tied to the suggestion countries might consider limiting fossil fuel production and consumption. To victims of climate change, the arguments might look like rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic.
Some nations were prepared to acknowledge the need to eliminate fossil fuels. Others noted the need for a future transition without compromising their need to develop or earn export income. Still others suggested the effects of fossil fuels might be minimised through technologies such as carbon capture and storage.
All 198 participating countries needed to approve any final declaration. So you can see the difficulty in reaching consensus.
More than 100 countries have pushed for a global commitment to a total phase-out of fossil fuels. But nations that profit immensely from fossil fuels – such as Russia, Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia – opposed any mention of fossil fuels in the final document.
The first draft of the declaration did not go down well.
Host negotiators attempted to broker a deal between the competing interests by omitting any reference to phasing “out” or “down”. Instead, they suggested countries “could” consider reducing production and consumption of fossil fuels. The compromise text produced by COP28 president Al Jaber and his team seemed to err on the side of fossil fuel interests. Despite this, the fossil fuel backers were still opposed.
Outcry was swift from advocates for strong climate action. The draft was labelled a “death certificate” by vulnerable small island states, while a withering attack came from concerned states, NGOs and even states with patchier climate records such as Australia, the United States, Canada and Japan.
As talks extended well beyond the original deadline, it came as some surprise that the final document was endorsed relatively swiftly.
The final version was more strident on the contribution of fossil fuels to climate change, and some advocates saw this as a significant signal. It asserted that the transition from fossil fuels needed to take place quickly, though “in a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade, so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science”.
It says something about the glacial pace of climate talks since they began in 1992 that this is the first time the contribution of fossil fuels to climate change has ever been acknowledged in a final COP document. And here, critics lamented the lack of detail over how goals would be implemented or commitments realised.
The conference also delivered important commitments to tripling renewable energy, expanding nuclear power, and a new pledge to cut emissions from cooling technologies such as air conditioning, which will become increasingly important as the world heats up. The talks also saw recognition of the increasingly significant role of the agricultural sector in contributing to climate change.
But more must be done. In 2023, temperatures are already spiking past the crucial threshold of 1.5°C. The global stocktake of emissions cuts released in advance of the talks shows our current efforts are not enough to stop further warming. Countries such as Australia advocated stronger language on ending fossil fuels while maintaining a steady pipeline of new fossil fuel projects at home. It’s little wonder, then, that the lead negotiator of the the Alliance of Small Island States said “the process has failed us”.
In short, and despite the diplomatic achievement of an agreement that looked unlikely only hours earlier, it’s still hard to say the international community is taking this enormous challenge as seriously as it should.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/14/victoria-plans-gas-ban-as-part-of-roadmap-to-renewables/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 14, 2023",Victoria plans gas ban as part of roadmap to renewables,"The Victorian government has released an updated Gas Substitution Roadmap which outlines the next steps for the state’s shift from fossil gas to electric alternatives, including a ban on gas connections in new homes starting from next month.
“From January 1, 2024, all new homes that require a planning permit will not be connected to the gas network,” the government said, adding that it will also begin consultation on the potential future expansion of this phase out to encompass “all new residential dwellings and some commercial buildings.”
This work will be completed through a Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) that will be conducted during 2024. The RIS is expected to exclude some industries, including Victoria’s hospitality, large commercial, industrial and manufacturing sectors.
While the ban on gas connections in new homes will kick in from next month, the Victorian government also announced that from next year rebates will be available to support Victorians to upgrade to electric induction cooktops and hot water systems.
“We’re ensuring Victorians aren’t locked into expensive fossil gas prices and sky-high energy bills for decades, helping them switch to efficient electric appliances that will deliver significant bill savings,” Victoria Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said, noting that the price of gas has climbed 35% in the past two years.
It is estimated that existing households that go all electric can save an average of $1,700 a year, or up to $2,700 a year with solar installed – a 60% reduction in energy bills. The ban on gas connections in new homes will also eliminate a $400 annual charge.
Dan Cass, executive director of advocacy group Rewiring Australia, described the updated roadmap as a “big step in the right direction,” saying it provides a clear policy signal for the energy, appliances and building sectors that “the zero-carbon future for households is electrification.”
“Electrification offers more to Victoria than any other state because it has a higher proportion of households currently reliant on fossil gas for heating, hot water and cooking, which exposes them to price gouging by international energy companies,” he said.
Cass said he expects Victoria’s approach should inspire other states to embrace policies that help households to save money by getting off and independent of expensive fossil gas.
“Electrification is the swiftest, cheapest way to lower emissions and remove thousands of dollars a year from energy bills, and it can be done with existing, off-the-shelf technology,” he said.
The Victorian government’s announcement comes just days after a regulation to prevent new gas network connections to buildings in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) commenced.
ACT Energy Minister Shane Rattenbury said the new regulation, which came into effect on 8 December, 2023, is an important step in the territory reaching net zero emissions by 2045.
“The regulation will apply to all residential buildings, commercial land-use zones and community facility zones,” he said.
Rattenbury acknowledged that there will be cases where electrification is not yet feasible, noting that the regulation will not apply to other land-use zones, including industrial zones.
“An exemption process will also be in place to provide options for businesses and commercial activities,” he said.

The company said the loan will deliver the “much-needed capital” for ACEN’s renewable energy projects in a market that it said is a critical player in its ambitious goal to expand its renewable energy capacity in Australia and the broader Asia-Pacific region to 20 GW by 2030.
“The loan agreement underlines ACEN’s strategic move to bolster its renewable energy initiatives in Australia, an emerging key market for the company,” the firm said.
ACEN Treasurer Cecile Cruzabra said the loan will not only underpin the firm’s capacity in the market but will also enable it to “manage our foreign currency risk.”
“This AUD green term loan of ACRI is a significant stepping stone in our funding journey, supporting our expansion plans in Australia, as well as helping manage our foreign currency risk in AUD,” she said.
The new funding agreement comes after the Philippines-based company announced in September it will invest $6 billion in the Australian market over the next three years as part of its ambition to bring a further 3 GW of new renewable capacity online.
ACEN currently has 1 GW of renewable energy projects in construction and operation in Australia and an additional 8 GW of capacity across solar, wind, battery and pumped hydro projects in its development pipeline.
Included in its projects is the New England Solar Farm which will be the biggest operating solar plant in Australia when its full capacity of 720 MW across two stages is complete.
Construction of the 400 MW first stage of the project has already been completed with ACEN confirming that production from the first stage reached its full capacity earlier this week.
ACEN Australia Managing Director David Pollington said the New England project, being developed near Uralla in northern New South Wales (NSW), is now generating clean renewable energy into the National Electricity Market (NEM).
“The project will provide enough clean renewable energy to power around 300,000 homes, but it’s also providing a really productive space where sheep can graze, protected from the harsh elements, particularly during hot conditions,” he said.
Pollington said more than 2,000 merino sheep are already grazing around the one million solar panels installed across the 1,200-hectares stage 1 project site, with up to 6,000 sheep expected to be grazing amongst the solar panels early in 2024.
Work has already started on stage 2 of the New England project which includes a 320 MW solar development and a 200 MW, two-hour battery energy storage system.
Other projects in ACEN’s Australian portfolio include the 400 MW Stubbo Solar Farm being developed in NSW’s central west, and the proposed 800 MW, 12-hour Phoenix pumped hydro project being developed near Wellington within the Central West Orana REZ.
In addition to the $6 billion investment in Australia, ACEN plans to invest $10 billion in renewable energy projects in other parts of the world. The company aims to reach 50 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030.

Snowy Hydro said the 143-metre-long tunnel boring machine, named Florence, is now moving ahead with the excavation of the 17-kilometre tunnel that will link the pumped hydro project’s upper reservoir, the Tantangara reservoir, to the lower reservoir at Talbingo in the NSW Snowy Mountains.
The 2000-tonne Florence, one of three tunnel boring machines deployed on the 2 GW expansion of the existing 4.1 GW Snowy Mountain pumped hydro scheme, has been sitting almost idle since December last year after it hit soft and wet ground and caused a large sinkhole to form above it in the Kosciuszko National Park.
The company said tunnelling is now being conducted in slurry mode and progress is “slow and steady” but Snowy Hydro Chief Executive Officer Dennis Barnes welcomed the resumption of works.
“We were very pleased to receive the green light for tunnelling at Tantangara to recommence and to allow remediation of the subsidence area,” he said.
Barnes said the modified regulatory approvals extend the project’s western boundary above Florence which enable close monitoring of surface conditions as the machine advances.
“The Snowy 2.0 delivery team is acutely aware of its responsibilities working in the sensitive environment of Kosciuszko National Park,” he said. “We are focused on achieving excellent environmental outcomes throughout construction of this pumped-hydro expansion of the Snowy Scheme and critical infrastructure for Australia’s transition to renewable energy.”
Snowy Hydro said other tunnel boring operations are “making good progress”, with a machine named Lady Eileen Hudson having drilled about 1km of the tailrace tunnel at Talbingo since beginning work in July.
The Snowy 2.0 project, which will provide 2 GW of dispatchable energy and 350 GWh of long-duration energy storage to the National Electricity Market (NEM), was first announced in 2017.
The project was originally due to be operational by 2021 and was expected to cost about $2 billion but it has been plagued by time and budget blowouts. The last estimates had the cost of the project at $12 billion while the project is now expected to commence full commercial operations in December 2028.

Construction of the Bundaberg solar farm is expected to commence in early 2024 with the facility expected to begin operations in late 2025.
Telstra said the offtake agreement will secure up to 153 GWh per annum of renewable energy output to the electricity grid, with the solar farm forecast to generate enough renewable energy to power about 30,000 homes.
Telstra Chief Executive Officer Vicki Brady said the agreement is the sixth clean energy offtake deal the company has signed in recent years as part of the telco’s transition to 100% renewable electricity by 2025.
“Once these projects are fully up and running, our share of their renewable energy output will be equivalent to our own electricity consumption,” she said.
Telstra also has PPAs in place with the 70 MW Emerald and 120 MW Munna Creek solar farms in Queensland. It also has offtake agreements in place with the MacIntyre Wind Farm in Queensland, the Murra Warra Wind Farm in Victoria and the 58 MW extension of the Crookwell Wind Farm being developed in New South Wales (NSW) by GPG.
Brady said Telstra’s investments in renewable energy projects have supported more than $1.2 billion (USD 800 million) worth of projects across Queensland, Victoria and NSW, noting that the PPAs the company has signed will also help support nearly 1,300 local jobs during the construction phase of development and 60 ongoing jobs for regional communities.
“Investments like these also help boost regional employment, with this project expected to create over 100 jobs during the 12-18 months construction phase,” she said.
In addition to matching its electricity consumption with renewable energy, Telstra has also committed to achieve a reduction in its absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030.
“We also have a significant focus on reducing our own emissions and working with our customers, business partners and suppliers to support their emission reduction efforts,” Brady said.
“As of June this year, we have reduced our combined scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% and our scope 3 emissions by 28%, from a FY19 baseline.”

A group of researchers from the Australian National University (ANU) and Sydney-based PV manufacturer Sundrive has utilised Monte Carlo Ray Trace (MCRT) techniques and electrical modelling to assess the power yield gains that bifacial rooftop PV systems offer compared to monofacial counterparts.
The scientists explained that their modelling framework couples MCRT with a detailed electrical model of high-efficiency bifacial PV modules, which they said tackles the typical limitations associated with traditional view factor (VF) modelling.
“Specifically, the approach resolves the complexities of real-world factors, including mismatch phenomena at both the cell-to-cell and array levels arising from non-uniform illumination effects and edge effects,” they said. “Moreover, it meticulously accounts for non-uniform illumination effects stemming from module frames and mounting components, an aspect often overlooked in previous models.”
The proposed approach works in four steps: Optical modelling; thermal modelling; electrical modelling; and integration. The MCRT model assesses direct and diffuse light separately and combines the results based on measured direct and diffuse irradiance values at each timestep.
The research group utilised the MCRT framework for analysing the performance of two rows of eight solar modules each with a constant row-to-row distance of 5 m. The modules are tilt-rack mounted at different angles at over 20 cm above the surface of the roof. “It’s important to note that our exploration of system design does not extend to considerations of module spacing or other design factors that influence optimal system performance,” it said, referring to the limitations of their technique.
The analysis showed that rooftop reflectivity is a key factor in increasing a bifacial rooftop PV system performance. The academics found that bifacial arrays can provide energy gains that are up to 22.6% higher than those of monofacial counterparts. “Additionally, the investigation revealed that rooftop reflectivity also influences the optimal tilt angle for bifacial modules,”  they emphasised. “Compared to monofacial modules, bifacial modules exhibit higher optimal tilt angles for maximum energy generation.”
Moreover, the analysis demonstrated that system and module design also play a decisive role in increasing power yield, with parallel interconnections of top and bottom substrings being particularly beneficial. “Without parallel substrings, bifacial gain was reduced by 0.9 % for a system with mounting components at a 75 % reflective rooftop,” the scientists noted.
Their findings were introduced in the study “Accurate modeling of the bifacial gain potential of rooftop solar photovoltaic systems,” which was recently published in Energy Conversion and Management.

Canadian Solar’s e-Storage subsidiary has launched SolBank 3.0, the latest iteration of its utility-scale battery energy storage system. It said the new product offers up to 45% more capacity and a 40% decrease in commissioning time compared to the previous 2.0 iteration.
The 20-foot containerised battery system offers up to 2.35 MW of power and a capacity of 5 MWh. It features higher density energy cells, advanced safety systems, liquid cooling, and active balance controls.
SolBank 3.0 features lithium-ferro-phosphate cells and sports a 93% round-trip efficiency. It is offered in two-hour and four-hour duration configurations. The battery pack is IP-67 rated for safety.
The battery comes equipped with a pack and electrical redundancy protection system, abnormal performance detection, multi-level fire alarms, suppression protection, and more as part of its safety and controls system. An optimised thermal management system reduces auxiliary power consumption by up to 30% compared to the previous generation, said Canadian Solar.
“SolBank 3.0 features exceptional new elements like higher energy density cells and advanced safety design,” said Colin Parkin, president of e-Storage. “In addition, our e-STORAGE team also provides value-added services, such as system capacity maintenance and augmentations, operation and maintenance, and plant optimisation.”
In November, Canadian Solar reported $1.85 billion of revenue for the third quarter.  Solar module shipments fell short of expectations at 8.3 GW. However, the company’s module shipments have increased 39% on a year-on-year basis.
Canadian Solar expects module demand to rise sharply in 2024, with shipments increasing roughly 50% year on year. But Roth Capital Partners said that this may be a bit optimistic as the company looks to clear excess inventory channels in Europe. It expects module demand to increase by only 10% to 15% in 2024, driven mostly by utility-scale demand, while residential solar demand could fall in 2024.
