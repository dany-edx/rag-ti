Researchers from Shenzhen University and Nanjing Tech University in China have developed a seawater electrolysis system (SES) for the direct electrolysis of seawater, without side reactions or corrosion.
The new method works via self-driven water migration to sidestep the need for a separate desalination process. The energy consumption is purportedly comparable to that of industrial alkaline electrolysis with pure water.
To develop the lab-scale electrolyser, the scientists separated the two electrode layers with a diaphragm layer and then submerged them in a concentrated hydroxide (OH−) solution – the SDE. They placed a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane between the seawater and the SDE. They claim this design allows the biased diffusion of water vapour, but fully prevents the penetration of liquid seawater and impurity ions such as magnesium, chloride and sulfate.
“During operation, the difference in water vapour pressure between the seawater and the SDE across the membrane provides a driving force for spontaneous seawater gasification (evaporation) at the seawater side and the diffusion of water vapour through the short gas path inside the membrane to the SDE side, where it is re-liquified by absorption by the SDE,” the scientist explained.
The consumption of water in the SDE during electrolysis maintains the pressure difference across the membrane, ensuring the continuous entry of freshwater, without extra energy consumption.
“When the water migration rate equals the electrolysis rate, a new thermodynamic equilibrium is established between the seawater and the SDE, and continuous and stable water migration through a ‘liquid-gas-liquid’ mechanism is realised to provide fresh water for electrolysis,” the researchers said.
The lab-scale electrolyser steadily produced hydrogen from seawater for more than 72 hours, with average voltages of approximately 1.95 V and 2.3 V at current densities of 250 mA cm−2 and 400 mA cm−2, respectively. After 72 hours, the concentrations of chloride, sulfate, and magnesium impurities were only 0.008%, 0.052%, and 0.089% of the original.
“Calculations show that the electricity expense of [hydrogen] production is approximately 4.6 kWh Nm-3H2 and 5.3 kWh Nm-3H2 at current densities of 250 mA cm−2 and 400 mA cm−2, respectively, which is comparable to that of industrial alkaline electrolysis with pure water,” the scientists claimed.
To prove the concept, they fabricated a scaled-up SES measuring 82 cm x 62 cm x 70.5 cm. It reportedly exhibited stable performance for more than 3,200 hours and energy consumption of approximately 5.0 kWh Nm-3H2, with no detectable increase in impurity ions.
The scientists said their method can be further developed by using other electrolytes able to absorb water vapour and conduct ions, or high-performance electrocatalysts able to operate in the SDE environment. They added that the strategy could be applied to other non-volatile liquids like highly concentrated acid, alkali and salt solutions for use in industrial wastewater treatment.
In addition, it could be used to produce hydrogen while recovering useful resources such as lithium from water. Further research is also needed for the electrolyser’s compatibility with renewable energy sources to match that of conventional electrolysers.
The scientists shared their findings in “A membrane-based seawater electrolyser for hydrogen generation,” which was recently published in Nature.

Erthos, an Arizona-based startup, has developed a new way to install solar power plants directly on the ground, without the need for mounting structures.
“It takes advantage of the heat absorption properties of the earth, offers unbeatable aerodynamics, and is the lowest cost installation method in the world,” the company said in a statement.
Erthos claims that the new method enables the construction of solar plants in half the time and a third of the land compared to conventional ground-mounted facilities. The new method also uses 70% fewer cables and trenches, and reportedly reduces installation costs by at least 20%.
Daniel Flaningan, head of marketing and product at Erthos, said the project design only requires light civil engineering. The method is also usable in different topographies, with little to no grading. In addition, projects built under this system can withstand “category 4” hurricanes, according to the company.
The company recently signed an agreement with US developer Industrial Sun LLC for a new solar project of more than 100 MW in Texas.

“As it is an area with minimal developable land, the developer could not install such a large project with conventional solar technologies, which usually require between five and six acres of land per megawatt,” said Erthos. “In contrast, Earth Mount Solar PV typically requires less than 2.5 acres per MW, achieving more than double the energy density of typical systems.”
The company is offering its Earth Mount Solar system with its software platform and long-term energy services, including full operations and maintenance. It also provides robotic cleaning services. In addition to the United States, the company has experience in Latin America, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, India, and Asia.

Sineng Electric has revealed via its LinkedIn account that it has started operating a giant battery project in China’s Shandong province.
It said the project is fully powered by its own 3.45 MW and 3.15 MW turnkey solutions for power conversion systems. It is equipped with an automated control system with independent temperature controls and heat insulation. It said the system will supply 400 million kWh of clean electricity per year.
The batteries have a maximum efficiency of 98.08%, measure 6,058 mm × 2,896 mm × 2,438 mm, and weigh in at 15,000 kg, including the oil transformer. The storage facility has a capacity of 400 MW/800 MWh and is the province’s largest to date, the company said, without disclosing additional technical details about the project.
