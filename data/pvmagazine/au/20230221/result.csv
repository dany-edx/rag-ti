While the long-term vision remains (somewhat) precarious, the short-term outlook has actually improved, with the commitment of a number of big battery projects – perhaps most notably the Waratah Super Battery in New South Wales, which AEMO credited with markedly decreasing reliability risks in both NSW and Queensland.

While big battery projects have shift reliability concerns for the next few years, AEMO wants to see more solid generation, transmission and storage projects realised before it can be secure Australia won’t face reliability gaps in the next decade as coal and gas generators continue to exit.
To be clear – Australia’s project pipeline is ample. AEMO’s concern is that while there is much enthusiasm, the rate at which actual new projects are joining the grid still leaves margin for error.

As AEMO notes, since releasing its modelling last August, 1,326 MW of wind and 461 MW / 604 MWh of battery storage projects have met its commitment criteria.
“The NEM has a strong pipeline of proposed generation and storage projects, totalling three times today’s generation capacity, with large-scale solar, wind and batteries accounting for 86%,” AEMO CEO Daniel Westerman said.
“Investment in firming generation, such as pumped hydro, gas and long-duration batteries, is critical to complement our growing fleet of weather-dependent renewable generation to meet electricity demand without coal generation,” he added.

Of all the states in Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM), the grid which serves New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania, South Australia’s reliability gap is second only to Tasmania, which has had any reliability concerns long-quelled by existing pumped hydro projects.
This is a noteworthy state of affairs because South Australian grid has the highest percentage of variable renewables in Australia – and likely the highest percentage for any similar gigawatt-scale grid in the world.
On average, South Australia was powered by 68.3% renewables in the 2022 financial year, up 7% from the previous year. The state is well on its way to its target of meeting 100% of demand from renewables by 2030.
The powerhouse state defies renewable critics, who have long claimed variable generation inherently leads to poor reliability.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/21/sydneys-magnis-energy-signs-deal-with-tesla-quietly-abandons-townsville-gigafactory-plan/,"EV,FINANCE,MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND,UNITED STATES",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 21, 2023","Sydney’s Magnis Energy signs deal with Tesla, quietly abandons Townsville gigafactory plan","Sydney-based Magnis Energy Technologies has become the latest Australian company to sign a binding offtake deal with Tesla, as the US giant scrambles to secure battery materials. Specifically, the deal is for what’s known as an anode active material or AAM, a graphite-based material crucial in lithium-ion batteries.
The conditional agreement will see Magnis supply Tesla with a minimum of 17,500 tonnes per annum of AAM for three years at a fixed price, though Tesla has the option to double its supply to potentially buy as much as 35,000 tonnes per annum. 
The deal hinges on Magnis actually finding a site and bringing its envisioned AAM plant into commercial production no later than February 1, 2025.
Although Magnis is an Australian, ASX-listed company, most of its ventures are abroad – including its proposed AAM plant, which is to be constructed in the US. Under Biden’s new Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the country is offering strong incentives to source locally produced battery materials. Clearly looking to move into the lucrative new market, Magnis is seeking to be one of the first players offering AAM in North America, providing an alternate to China, which is the easily most dominant player today.
Renascor Resources
Magnis’ offshore focus is now fairly solidified, with the company this month softly backing down from previously-hyped plans to build a lithium-ion battery gigafactory in Townsville, Queensland. The feasibility study for the 18 GWh Imperium3 Townsville (iM3TSV) Battery plant, as it was known, was funded by the Queensland government and proposed in the Lansdown Industrial Precinct.
In its half yearly report, published earlier this year, Magnis noted Townsville City Council had revoked its original land allocation, citing that the Lansdown precinct would now focus on hydrogen. The council gave the company the opportunity to apply for an alternate site – an offering Magnis turned down.

Somewhat confusingly, the company then went on to say it would not be proceeding with the project, but included a footnote saying it is considering other potential options for its Australian gigafactory.
The way this news was embedded in the company’s half yearly results seems to have been queried by the ASX, with the company later putting out a statement downplaying the importance of the announcement.
“The company does not consider the [Townsville] project update to be information that a reasonable person would expect to have a material impact on the price or value of the company’s securities… The project, while remaining an important long-term strategic initiative for the company, constitutes a non-core (and thus immaterial) component of the company’s overall business.”
With its Townsville gigafactory seemingly out of the picture, Magnis is focussing on its Imperium3 lithium-ion battery plant in New York, of which it owns a 61% interest. The plant began production in August 2022, though Magnis in February told investors there will be a delay in gaining United Nations certification for the safe transportation of the lithium-ion batteries manufactured at the plant.

“In one of the last tests performed, a cell reported an irregular result which has resulted in the process starting again with a new batch of cells,” Magnis said.
On top of its New York battery plant, Magnis owns the Nachu Graphite project in Tanzania.
The Magnis deal follows on from a similar deal Tesla made with another ASX-listed graphite company, Syrah Resources, in late 2021.
Under that deal, Melbourne-based Syrah Resources will supply Tesla with 8,000 tonnes (the vast majority) of the Active Anode Material (AAM) it plans to produce at its facility in Vidalia, Louisiana. The plant is set to processes graphite mined in Mozambique into AAM.
At the time the Tesla deal was announced, Syrah Resources had not yet reached a final investment decision for the Vidalia plant, but construction on the facility is now nearing completion, with Syrah Resources saying production is set to start in the third quarter of 2023.

Currently, China dominates the global supply of graphite anode materials, accounting for an estimated 70% to 85%. With the US and Europe eager to diversify supply chains, Australian companies are competing to emerge as viable alternatives with several companies developing battery-ready graphite material facilities, as well as mines themselves, both in Australia and abroad. 
Such players include Renascor Resources which is currently working towards realising its Siviour Battery Anode Material Project. Likewise, Western Australian startup International Graphite is also working on building a graphite battery anode material hub in Collie, WA.

By the end 2022, Sunwiz found leading Chinese manufacturers managed to regain some of their marketshare from “premium” brands, after dipping quite dramatically in Q4 2021 to Q1 2022. Chinese brands haven’t quite made it back to the 80% marketshare they enjoyed in the first half of 2021, but rounded out the year above 70%.

Both “premium” and other manufacturers grew considerably between Q3 and Q4 in 2021, before gradually sliding back over the course of 2022. It is worth nothing ‘other’ manufacturers, primarily smaller Chinese brands, finished off 2022 in a markedly better position than they were for most of 2021.
In alphabetical order, Australia’s top 10 solar panel manufacturers in 2022 were:
Note: Astronergy tied in 10th place.*
Leading Chinese inverter manufacturers reached a highpoint in their combined marketshare in the middle of 2022, before easing back slightly towards the year’s end, Sunwiz’s analysis found. 

Inversely, European inverter brands hit a low point mid-year, but clawed some of that marketshare back by the year’s end.
Module-level Power Electronics, or MLPE, stayed pretty much flat across the course of the year, with a minuscule rise over Q1 followed by a corresponding drop in Q4. Likewise, the marketshare of other inverter brands stayed pretty much flat over 2022.

University of New South Wales researchers have developed an algorithm that produces high-resolution modelled images from lower-resolution micro X-ray computerised tomography (CT) to enhance images of hydrogen Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). They aim to control water flows within fuel cells. “An advancement in water modelling is achieved using X-ray micro-computed tomography, deep learned super-resolution, multi-label segmentation, and direct multi-phase simulation,” said the researchers. The PEMFCs can become inefficient if the water cannot properly flow out of the cell and subsequently “floods” the system. “Until now, it has been very hard for engineers to understand the precise ways in which water drains, or indeed pools, inside the fuel cells due to their very small size and very complex structures,” the team said. They reported that the algorithm improves the field of view by around 100 times compared to the high-res image. The same scanner needs to take the low-res and high-res images. During training and testing, the algorithm achieved 97.3% accuracy when producing high-res modeling from low-res imagery and created a high-resolution model in just one hour. The researchers described their findings in “Large-scale physically accurate modelling of real proton exchange membrane fuel cell with deep learning,” which was recently published in Nature Communications. 
Dutch, German and Australian companies have expressed intentions to participate in TrHyHub, a joint hydrogen hub in Western Australia. “The Port of Rotterdam Authority and Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) confirmed their intention for further partnership,” said the Port of Rotterdam. About 20 companies plan to focus on the development of policy, standards, certifications, technologies, and supply chains. 
Institute for Basic Science (IBS) researchers in South Korea have presented a novel method to produce uniformly sized cobalt-platinum (Co-Pt) alloy nanoparticles through heat treatment. Bipyridine and chlorine ligands surround Co and Pt ions, respectively. The heat treatment then causes the bipyridine ligand to thermally decompose into a carbon shell that can protect the growing Co-Pt alloy nanoparticles. “In the nanocatalyst developed by the group, Co and Pt atoms were arranged in a regular way called the ‘intermetallic phase,’ where the unstable Co atoms are stabilized by the surrounding Pt atoms,” the researchers said in “Scalable production of an intermetallic Pt–Co electrocatalyst for high-power proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells,” which was recently published in Energy & Environmental Science. “When nitrogen was effectively doped onto the carbon support, ionomers (proton conductors) were homogeneously dispersed over the entire catalyst layer in the fuel cell, which better facilitated the supply of oxygen gas to the surface of the Co-Pt nanocatalyst.” The team said that the “simple and scalable method” offers enhanced fuel cell power performance with lower platinum use. Compared to state-of-the-art fuel cell catalysts, it “showed almost twice the power performance per platinum use,” said the researchers.
Germany and Belgium have agreed to link their hydrogen networks by 2028. “We want to deepen our dialogue on the production of hydrogen, inside and outside Europe, for trilateral cooperation, and on regulatory work within the European Union,” the countries stated. They said they will jointly examine possible cooperation in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. 
Lhyfe has obtained a construction permit for its second green and renewable hydrogen production site in the Morbihan region of Brittany, France. “Lhyfe Bretagne, which should be operational by the second half of 2023, will mainly supply hydrogen for transport in the region and the industrial processes of regional companies,” said the French hydrogen producer. It will begin civil engineering work at the end of February to produce up to 2 tons of green hydrogen per day (5 MW) next to a wind farm. Clients will be within a radius of about 150 km. The company aims to install more than 3 GW of capacity by 2030.
Tevva has performed a range test of a hydrogen-electric prototype truck, driving a total of 1,000 km. “The return journey saw the truck cover almost 350 miles (563 km) alone, without needing a single stop for recharging,” said the UK-based company. “This was made possible by the truck’s hydrogen fuel cell which tops up the range-extended (Rex) vehicle’s lithium battery when needed.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/21/custom-made-3d-printed-solid-state-batteries/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"FEBRUARY 21, 2023",Custom-made 3D printed solid-state batteries,"From pv magazine Global
California-based Sakuu has announced it has been successfully and consistently manufacturing 3D-printed fully functional batteries in custom shapes and sizes at its Silicon Valley battery pilot line facility since December.
To achieve this, the company relied on its patented Kavian platform, which was developed to enable commercial-scale production of a wide range of battery technologies, from lithium-ion to lithium metal and all-solid-state batteries.
“The platform can customise the form factor of the battery – whereby the battery itself can become part of product design via customised shapes and sizes,” Karl Littau, chief technology officer at Sakuu, explains.
Sakuu’s patterned battery cells were made with patterned openings for thermal management in a fully dry process. Namely, the achievement of patterned battery printing enables more effective use of battery cell volume with new pathways in thermal dynamic regulation.
This allows integration of fixturing, sensors, and thermal transport pathways, as well as regulation through the patterned design – especially when thin sub-cell battery structures are stacked with identical patterned openings for thermal management in alignment, according to Sakuu.
The company’s fully industrialised process for printing batteries using a proprietary multi-material, multi-layer approach in a parallel and dry process stands in opposition to layer-on-layer printing or screen-printing, which are inherently wet processes that require significant energy to remove unwanted solvents and are susceptible to poor printing quality and unreliable production.
Founded in 2016, Sakuu has already achieved important milestones. Last year, it announced the benchmark energy-density achievement of 800 Wh/L in its first-generation non-printed lithium metal battery. In addition, the first-generation lithium-metal battery demonstrated high energy retention at 97% after 200 cycles. Sakuu’s battery, while remaining dendrite-free, is expected to record 80% retention at 800 cycles once cycling has been completed.
Sakuu’s stated goal was to make fully 3D printable solid-state batteries capable of greater than 1200 Wh/L by 2023, substantially surpassing lithium-ion batteries found in today’s top-selling EVs that function in a range of 500–700 Wh/L.
The company’s latest achievement is described as first-of-its-kind in battery manufacturing and an important step towards the company’s planned commercial scale production of next-generation SwiftPrint batteries, including solid-state batteries, from its Kavian platform in gigafactories worldwide.
“We believe we have the only known solution for manufacturing solid-state batteries at scale with our novel Kavian platform,” Sakuu Founder and CEO Robert Bagheri said. Sakuu’s Kavian™ platform will be sold to other battery manufacturers as well as to automotive, e-mobility, and aerospace manufacturers.
In addition, Sakuu plans on licensing its own battery chemistries, both Li-metal and solid-state, to be produced with either traditional roll-to-roll manufacturing or in gigafactories using Kavian manufacturing.
