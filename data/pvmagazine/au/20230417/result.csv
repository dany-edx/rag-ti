Greenpeace Australia Pacific Head of Advocacy and Strategy Glenn Walker said the closure of the power plant, which was commissioned in 1971, is a tipping point for Australia’s energy transition.
Walker said when the closure of Liddell was first announced in 2017, it caused a political storm but it has since proven a major driver for the deployment of renewable energy assets.
“Despite the initial protesting from small-minded politicians and commentators, this announcement helped spur a massive four-fold increase in renewable energy production in NSW since 2017, meaning that dirty Liddell will be replaced by clean energy,” he said.
“The lesson from Liddell should be that companies like AGL and politicians alike need to show courage and get on with the job of cleaning up our dirty energy system.”
“With leadership, forward planning, and smart investment in renewable energy the transition from coal and gas to renewables can be seamless.”
AGL has already outlined plans to transform the Liddell site into an integrated, low-carbon industrial energy hub dominated by a 500 MW/2 GWh battery energy storage system and including a wind farm, a solar storage system, a waste-to-energy plant and a green hydrogen production facility.
It has already secured planning approval to build the battery at the site, providing a new source of dispatchable power and allowing the company to reuse the existing grid connection infrastructure.
It is anticipated AGL will make a final investment decision on the Liddell battery in the second half of this year.
The closure of Liddell is the first closure of a major coal-burning power station since 2017, after Engie’s Hazelwood station was shut down in Victoria, but it is certain not to be the last.
A report from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) shows that Australia’s transition to a grid dominated by renewables is accelerating faster than expected, with the operator suggesting 60% of coal-fired generating capacity will exit the National Electricity Market (NEM) by 2030.
The Eraring Power Station at Lake Macquarie in the NSW Hunter region is among those plants destined to exit the system with Origin Energy announcing it will close the facility in August 2025, seven years earlier than previously scheduled.
AGL has also announced it will close it Bayswater power station in the Hunter Valley “no later than” 2033, two years ahead of its previously scheduled closure, while the Loy Yang A plant in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley is to close by 2035.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/17/nz-to-fast-track-approval-process-for-solar-projects/,"INSTALLATIONS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW ZEALAND",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 17, 2023",NZ to fast-track approval process for solar projects,"United Kingdom-based renewables developer Island Green Power, under the Rangiriri Solar Farm Project and Waerenga Solar Farm Project names, has announced its intent to develop two new solar projects in the Waikato region on the upper North Island of New Zealand.
The proposed 180 MWp Waerenga Solar Farm and 130 MWp Rangiriri Solar Farm are expected to generate about 220 GWh and 300 GWh, respectively, of clean electricity a year. State-owned utility Transpower, as the owner and operator of the national grid, is named as a joint applicant as it handles the associated infrastructure.
Both projects have been referred to an independent fast-track consenting panel, which provides for an accelerated consenting process for projects with the potential to boost economic activity and contribute to New Zealand’s efforts to speed up the roll out of renewable energy generation facilities as it strives to reach net zero by 2050.
NZ Environment Minister David Parker said the Fast-track Consenting Act, introduced to accelerate infrastructure development, lets ministers send projects straight to the independent panel, which is administered by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA).
Parker said the process allows for the panel to consider the consent, a reduced number of parties that can make submissions and a shorter consenting process with the fast-track process reducing consenting time by “an average of 15 months per project saving infrastructure builders time and money.”
“These projects are examples of the type of renewable energy development needed to meet our environmental goals, and increasing generation and supply improves our national energy resilience,” he said.
“The permanent fast-track consenting process is a crucial part of our plan to reduce emissions and improve our economic security by increasing domestically generated renewable energy.”
Between 60 and 70% of New Zealand’s electricity is provided by renewable sources. Most of this is supplied from hydro generation and less than 1% is generated by solar power.
The proposed Waerenga Solar Farm will include approximately 290,000 PV panels and associated infrastructure installed on a 385-hectare site near Waerenga township, about 100 southeast of Auckland.
The Rangiriri Solar Farm, to be developed on a 275ha site approximately 20 kilometres east of Waerenga, will include about 200,000 panels. If approved, it is expected construction will take about 18 months.
Parker said the projects are among five renewable energy projects referred through the fast-track consenting process since late 2021.
Included in this list is the 140 MWp Waiterimu Solar Farm project, also being developed by Island Green Power, this time under the Waikato Solar Farms name.
The proposed solar farm, to be developed on a 380ha site at Waiterimu, less than 20km south of Waerenga and Rangiriri projects, would comprise approximately 225,000 solar panels capable of generating about 300 GWh of clean electricity per year.
The New Zealand arm of British company Harmony Energy has already secured approval under the fast-track consenting process to construct and operate the 147 MW Tauhei Solar Farm in the Waikato region.
The proposed Tauhei Solar Farm will comprise about 330,000 panels spread across approximately 180 hectares of existing farmland. It is anticipated construction will commence in 2024, with the solar farm to be operational in 2025.
It took just 70 working days for the application to be approved.
NZ Windfarms has also lodged an application with the fast-track consenting panel to repower the existing 45 MW Te Rere Hau Wind Farm near Palmerston North. If approved, the 97 small twin-bladed turbines would be replaced by 30 three-bladed turbines.
If all five renewable energy projects are approved, the projects will contribute more than 700 MWp to the national grid during peak generation.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/17/microwave-technology-tipped-to-advance-solar-cell-production/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",EDGAR MEZA,"APRIL 17, 2023",Microwave technology tipped to advance solar cell production,"A team of researchers at Macquarie University have developed a microwave technology they say will improve the production of solar cells, while making them easier to recycle.
During the fabrication of solar panels, silicon goes through several high-temperature processes known as annealing. Currently the cells are cooked in an oven. But in a recent paper in Applied Physics Letters, a team led by senior lecturer Binesh P Veettil show that heating with microwave radiation is nearly as efficient, while saving considerable time and energy and offering other advantages.
Microwave radiation selectively heats silicon, leading to almost instantaneous effects with massive savings of energy, said the researchers.
“The microwave annealing of semiconductor devices has not been extensively researched and is rarely utilized in industry, yet it has the potential to significantly reduce the time and cost associated with large-volume semiconductor processing, such as the various heating and annealing processes required in the manufacture of photovoltaic modules,” wrote the researchers.
The paper describes microwave annealing of silicon solar cells, the effective passivation of light-induced defects, and a reduction in light-induced degradation. The researchers found that silicon solar cells are heated rapidly in a microwave field and that effective boron-oxygen defect passivation can be achieved by microwave processing in less than two seconds. Microwave annealing yields similar results as compared to rapid thermal annealing, they found.
The use of microwave radiation leaves the rest of the laminated panel of glass, plastic and aluminium largely unaffected. That property has led to an unexpected recycling benefit, for which the group has a patent pending.
The microwave treatment softens the plastic (ethylene vinyl acetate) coating that protects the silicon plate from moisture and contamination, making it possible to peel it off mechanically. The plate can therefore be easily delaminated and its components reused without employing harsh chemicals.
“Until now it made economic sense to just dump the panels in the landfill,” Veettil said. “In the rare instances when they are recycled, you crush the panels, heat them to about 1,400 C and wash them with chemicals to remove the plastic – a highly energy-demanding process. But now, as the solar panels which began to be installed in vast numbers about 20 to 30 years ago are reaching the end of their life and being decommissioned, governments are demanding they be recycled.”
Other advantages offered by microwave annealing include the ability to focus microwave radiation. The heating it induces can be selective and highly tuned. The researchers note, for example, that better-directed annealing is highly advantageous in newer panels that feature heterojunction technology, in which crystalline and amorphous silicon are interleaved.
“Precise focusing also means that annealing can be directed to specific parts of the solar panel, making it ideal for annealing solar panels with more intricate internal structures fabricated for special purposes,” the team adds.
In contrast to an oven, in which all kinds of chemical substances are shed from the walls, microwave annealing takes place in a clean environment. “So there is less contamination,” Veettil explained. “And the whole process can all be undertaken at room temperature.”
There are several other projects involving solar cells and sustainable energy underway at Macquarie. One of the co-authors of the annealing paper, Shujuan Huang, leads a group examining microwave annealing in perovskite solar cells. In this case, microwave radiation produced more efficient solar cells compared to conventional annealing methods, but the reason is not clear. The researchers are currently looking to solve that mystery.
Veettil’s research in collaboration with the school of photovoltaics at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, was initiated with funding from the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics and further supported by the Australian government through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/17/g7-targets-1-tw-of-solar-to-speed-up-renewable-energy-transition/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 17, 2023",G7 targets 1 TW of solar to speed up renewable energy transition,"Ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) member states, as well as representatives of the European Union, wrapped up a two-day meeting in Japan on Sunday with an agreement to ramp up the total amount of solar power generation to more than 1 TW by 2030 as part of plans to speed up the clean energy transition.
The members also pledged to increase offshore wind capacity by 150 GW before the end of the decade as part of an urgent need to accelerate the clean energy transition and transform the world’s energy systems in order to “achieve net zero in energy systems by 2050 at the latest.”
Officials from the G7 countries, which account for a quarter of carbon emissions, detailed their commitments in a 36-page communique issued after two days of talks held in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo.
“We will drastically increase electricity generated by renewable energies,” the members said.
“The G7 contributes to expanding renewable energy globally and bringing down costs by strengthening capacity including through a collective increase in offshore wind capacity of 150 GW by 2030 based on each country’s existing targets and a collective increase of solar to more than 1 TW by 2030.”
The members also vowed to promote improvement in innovative technologies, including perovskite solar cells and wave energy and in international standards of evaluation methods for introducing new technologies.
The G7 countries are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. The European Union (EU) is a “non-enumerated member”. The G7 account for a quarter of global carbon emissions and 40% of the world’s economic activity.
The members emphasised that an accelerated clean energy transition is key to improving security, stability and affordability of global energy supply and that there is “a real, urgent need to increase energy security and accelerate clean energy transitions” by diversifying supply, sources and routes.
“We reiterate the importance of significantly increasing the pace and scale of deployment of renewable energy in the decarbonization of our economies as effective means of enhancing our energy security through diversifying energy supply, reducing the dependency on fossil fuels, and achieving the goal of net zero by 2050 at the latest,” the document says.

The new renewable energy targets outlined in the communique are backed by an agreement to accelerate the phase out of unabated fossil fuels – with a particular focus on coal.
The countries agreed to prioritise “concrete and timely steps” towards accelerating the elimination of “domestic, unabated coal power generation”, as a part of a commitment to achieve at least a “predominantly” decarbonised power sector by 2035.
“We call on and will work with other countries to end new unabated coal-fired power generation projects globally as soon as possible to accelerate the clean energy transition in a just manner,” the document says.
Speaking on the sidelines of the meetings, U.S. Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry said the event had been “really constructive.”
“I think the unity for the goal that was expressed of phasing out unabated fossil fuels is a very important statement,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/17/trina-tracker-unveils-2p-tracker-solution-with-new-features/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,CHINA,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"APRIL 17, 2023",Trina Tracker unveils 2P tracker solution with new features,"From pv magazine Global
Trina Tracker, the smart tracker solution provider under Trina Solar, has launched a new version of its Vanguard 2P tracker at the Green Energy Expo in Daegu, South Korea, and at a pv magazine Webinar.
The new design of the Vanguard 2P has been optimised to reduce balance of system costs in harsh soiling conditions and scenarios with higher pile requirements. It purportedly improves on its Vanguard predecessor by using multiple motors on one tracker row. The new solution reportedly withstands higher wind loads and reduces tilt angle misalignment.
“The second generation of Vanguard 2P uses a multi-motor control system to replace the original mechanical method,” Trina Tracker said in a statement. “In the new drive system, the main controller sends commands and the secondary controller receives commands to drive the motors. The self-developed intelligent mechanism enables the synchronisation of multiple motors to avoid potential structure failures, which can save time and costs on operations and maintenance.”
The upgraded tracker solution also reportedly improves the structure’s compatibility with larger-sized modules up to 685 W. “All these improvements reduce system costs, lower levelised cost of energy (LCOE), and better fit the most challenging sites,” Trina Tracker said.
Trina Tracker launched the first version of the Vanguard 2P in 2021 and delivered 3 GW of trackers globally by the end of 2022.
“For the past few years, we’ve seen more projects in sites with slope terrains, deserts, and near coastal regions,” said Andrew Gilhooly, Head of Utility, Commercial and Industrial Solutions for Trina Solar Asia Pacific. “This requires solar components to meet more severe quality standards and include more innovative developments to operate under those harsh scenarios.   The second generation of Vanguard 2P aims to successfully solve such challenges,” he concluded.

Salgenx has developed a graphene production method that uses its saltwater redox flow battery. The membrane-less battery charges and discharges by using an electrolyser that splits sodium chloride (NaCl) into sodium (Na) and chlorine.
“The chlorine is then stored in the aqueous electrolyte, while the sodium is stored in the cathode,” Salgenx CEO Greg Giese told pv magazine. “In this instance, the cathode comprises a sacrificial material, graphite, which intercalates the sodium. Salgenx applies a proprietary technique that exfoliates the graphite into individual layers of graphene, which can be further processed for higher purity.”
The process of graphene exfoliation occurs during charging due to an electrochemical process. When an electric potential is applied to the graphite host, it causes guest-charged species in the electrolyte to intercalate into the graphite’s interlayer galleries and produce gaseous products that contribute to structural expansion, according to a recent paper on the topic.
The method does not use up sodium, leaving it for the battery’s discharge process. Salgenx claims it produces graphene for less than USD 1.25 ($1.85) per gram. “Salgenx’s flow battery system typically takes 4 to 6 hours to charge, usually during off-peak hours, enabling simultaneous production of graphene to enhance payback and become a revenue model,” the US-based tech startup said in a statement.
The on-demand graphene production machine will initially target the fiberglass and carbon fiber fabrication industry but can reportedly be applied to any graphene additive space.
In March, Salgenx said it had developed a system that uses the electricity stored in its battery to produce clean drinking water from seawater.
