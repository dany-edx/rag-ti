And the research to harness it,"Solar science is still far from peaking. Rather, in striving for energy security on our climate-challenged planet, many research organisations are evolving our understanding of light and its potential to interact with materials. Similar to the way in which research for space travel has brought us the improved satellite navigation system known as GPS and the cordless vacuum cleaner, research on how to best convert solar energy into electricity is spinning off some unexpected technologies.
pv magazine recently spoke with some of the researchers at the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science, to try to extend our gaze beyond the now venerable and entrenched silicon solar cell. The Centre’s work with excitons, which form when light is absorbed by a material, resulting in free charges — or the clean electric power we all crave — is forcing new thinking … about materials, about excitability, about the absorption and reflection of light throughout the spectrum.
Professor Jacek Jasieniak, Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at Monash University and a principal researcher with the Exciton Science ARC, has for the past four years been working with perovskites as a material class that shows promise for the next wave of solar generation. If you shine a light on a perovskite, he says, “that light will be absorbed, and in the absorption process, an electron is promoted into an excited state; at that point the electron can be collected in a solar cell, or the charges it generates can be recombined”.
Jasieniak and his team worked with that property — the potential for recombination — and the fact that halide substances are present in some chemical warfare agents and pesticides, and in perovskite crystals, to develop a light-emitting detection system for such toxins. 
“Quite simply,” says Jasieniak, “if we have a perovskite with a given halide, and we expose it to whatever analite we’re looking to detect, provided there’s a difference in that halide between the two species we’re going to see a big change in the colour that’s emitted.” 
The process, which offers sensitivity to these toxins that is two orders of magnitude greater than current capability (potentially below 10 parts per billion sensitivity compared to the current 1000+ parts per billion detection capability) has just been patented. The Exciton Science ARC is now working with the Department of Defence on the prototype for a portable detection system, likely deploying single-use cartridges based on perovskite crystals, for use in the field where soldiers’ lives depend on rapid detection of such deadly agents. 
The system also has applications in checking produce imported into Australia for potentially harmful pesticides. The use of chemicals such as methyl bromide and methyl iodide on crops such as strawberries and garlic is banned in some countries, but in others it isn’t. The ARC’s light-emitting alarm system lets Australian border forces screen for their presence in imports in an easy, mobile way.
Jasieniak muses over the need to see the qualities of materials through different lenses. “Perovskites are super materials for solar cells, and although they have inherently high efficiency and at the moment probably lack the stability that’s necessary to compete directly with silicon; it’s actually that instability that gives you the real sensitivity applicable to other technologies.”
Australia has some of the most beautiful and secure — as in difficult to counterfeit — currencies in the world, but would-be forgers are constantly catching up given improved access to low-cost technologies that can produce excellent mimics of our polymer banknotes.
Once again, a kind of reverse thinking in the realm of light-based reactions is driving the development of anti-counterfeiting technology at the Exciton Science ARC. Centre Director, Paul Mulvaney says, “Unlike solar energy, where we want to make everything highly scalable and reproducible, the Reserve Bank has the exact opposite requirement: it wants materials that are exciting and new, but completely unable to be reproduced by others — specifically counterfeiters.”
Without giving too much away, the ARC will run two trials this year incorporating infrared-active nanomaterials in inks used to print Australian currency. “The overarching goal,” says the CRC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science Annual Report 2020  is to produce banknote security features that are difficult to counterfeit and simple to verify.” The security technology must be cost-effective, durable, printable and safe to handle.
While this ARC Centre of Excellence works to develop the next generation of manufacture-ready solar-to-energy conversion materials — might be perovskites, might be organic solar cells, might be something as yet unidentified — some emerging technologies could be retrofitted to boost the performance of solar cells now in production.
Although silicon absorbs pretty much all the visible part of the light spectrum, “about 40% of the solar energy that hits your roof goes straight through the silicon solar cell,” says Mulvaney. A number of ARC Exciton Science groups around the country are working on materials that effectively harvest the part of that unused bounty known as infrared energy or heat. 
Retrofitting such materials to silicon solar cells “could make them much more efficient”, says Mulvaney.
In 2019 one international multi-university ARC research team published a paper in Nature Photonic, examining the key factors in upconversion performance.
The strategy of this group was to ‘upconvert light’, turning low energy light into more energetic, visible light which can excite silicon.
It concluded that there were still issues to be resolved, but that the novel hybrid nanosystem design offers “exciting opportunities for applications such as solar photovoltaic devices, deep-tissue biomedical imaging, optogenetics and nanomedicine among others.” 
Again, the knock-on applications of this technology go beyond energy production, but for solar upconversion it has been proven in principle, says Mulvaney, and he hopes to partner with a solar cell manufacturer on developing a prototype and perhaps a test bed. 
“A lot of people see solar as kind of ‘done’”, says Mulvaney. “We think that as the government hopefully, eventually, swings behind renewables in a stronger way that we’ll see a rollout of all sorts of different applications of photovoltaics.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/05/australian-first-manufacturer-directly-shares-excess-solar-generation-with-employees/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",NATALIE FILATOFF,"APRIL 5, 2021",Australian first: manufacturer directly shares excess solar generation with employees,"A company with a mission to mitigate the harsh effects of the sun and improve the energy efficiency of buildings will soon make the excess electricity generated by its commercial rooftop solar system available at a discount to employees. This new perk of working at the Sydney factory premises of Hunter Douglas, a supplier of blinds and window awnings, is believed to be an Australian first in terms of direct renewable energy trading between a company and its workers.
In mid-2018, the large roof of international company Hunter Douglas’s main Australian warehouse was blanketed with 800 kW of solar panels, as part of the firm’s commitment to sustainability.
“Everything we do is designed to grow our business and our customers’ business and contribute to a more sustainable world,” says the Hunter Douglas website.
The company’s advanced window treatments, using innovative materials and often automated systems, have long been designed to reduce energy loss in homes and offices, helping to save on heating and cooling costs and create more comfortable environments.
The installation of 2080 solar panels on its Rydalmere factory was intended, it says, “to support the local economy, continuing our investment in Australian manufacturing”. 
Over time, Hunter Douglas recognised that it could also benefit its employees by offering a reduced rate on excess energy it was exporting to the grid on weekends and on summer evenings after 4pm, when the facility is closed.

The sharing concept was realised using the energy traceability platform developed by technology innovator Enosi, and a new contract for energy supply offered by Simply Energy, the Australian retail arm of French energy giant Engie.
Enosi’s Powertracer allows energy consumers to choose the source of their energy — whether it be one or more solar or wind farms, or in this case, a rooftop solar installation. Using smart metering data, it traces, matches and settles energy production and consumption at half-hour intervals, so consumers can see exactly where their energy is coming from at any given time, and how much they’re saving by dealing direct.
To take advantage of the 5 cents per kilowatt hour discount offered by Hunter Douglas, employees must have a smart meter, and be willing to sign up for electricity supply with Simply Energy.
Hunter Douglas gets the same return on the power as it would from selling it to the grid, which enables it to keep seeing returns on its solar investment.
For employees who perhaps can’t afford to install solar on their own roofs, or who live in rented homes, it means they can source a good proportion of their energy from renewable generation, at some of the lowest energy prices available in New South Wales.
Enosi entered the market in December last year, after having been mentored from startup to commercial viability by the principals of Energy Estate via the renewable energy project developer’s new incubator structure, EnergyGrowth.
One of Enosi’s first applications is The Beehive Project, for which Enova Community Energy is using Powertracer to enable a Hunter Valley community to share a Tesla battery energy storage system. The shared BESS will allow each homeowner to get more out of their rooftop solar without investing in their own battery, while Powertracer accounts for each participant’s use of the joint storage facility.
Enosi’s system “gives consumers power” over their choice of energy provider, Vincent Dwyer, Principal of Energy Estate, told pv magazine Australia last year.
At the same time, it allows businesses such as Hunter Douglas to create a sense of community among their employees by spreading the benefits of their investment in solar.
 

“We believe the public should have direct access to cleaner, cheaper energy enabled by the Enosi platform, and that new wind and solar investments will be made to serve this new market,” say Enosi’s founders.
Through energy retailers such as Simply Energy and Energy Locals partnership with Powertracer, Enosi reckons households and businesses can today source 70% of their energy directly from renewables (for the time being, the remainder is sourced by the retailer from the grid).
Over time, it says, “we will introduce more and more wind and solar” generators to the platform, and probably also partner  with battery energy storage providers to ultimately provide 100% clean energy matching at a lower cost than is available through the grid.
In response to the energy crisis of the late 1970s, Hunter Douglas developed its Duette Honeycomb Shades, which trap air in their cell construction to keep homes warmer in winter and cooler in summer.
In response to the 21s century climate crisis, Enosi is making renewable energy directly accessible to consumers and enabling companies like Hunter Douglas to achieve True Zero if they choose to, while providing their partners and employees first-of-a-kind energy benefits.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/05/digital-substations-learn-how-to-reliably-work-with-variable-renewables/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"APRIL 5, 2021",Digital substations learn how to reliably work with variable renewables,"A substation, that cornerstone of the electricity system, often a mini, quirky corner building in any local area, is essential to grid reliability: converting voltage for local use, distributing energy and controlling power flows to and (now) from businesses and homes in its vicinity. Digital substations are not a new concept, but incorporating smarts into their performance, responsiveness and resilience is becoming key to managing rooftop PV resources, grid-connected and off-grid industrial energy supplies, and large-scale renewable generation.
This year, Hitachi ABB launched its Smart Digital Substation, which combines digital technology with the company’s Lumada Asset Performance Management (APM) software solution, to provide money-saving predictive management of substation assets. Its data interpretation also facilitates grid planning as more variable renewable assets, energy storage and loads/households are added to any sector of the grid.
A recent global report by Spanish software company, RatedPower, adds fuel to the expectation that digitalisation is set to transform the energy supply chain to favour renewable generation.
The digital substation is not bound up in physical bundles of copper wire, but orchestrates networks of intelligent electrical devices (IEDs) that monitor and direct electricity flow  to maintain balance in the grid.
“Upgrading to a smart digital substation makes all the information generated by those networks accessible to grid operators,” Hitachi ABB’s Claus Vetter, told pv magazine Australia.
Speaking from Hitachi-ABB Power Grid’s headquarters in Switzerland, where he is Global Product Manager for the Automation and Communication division, Vetter explained that the reduction in cabling of a digital substation not only substantially reduces the real estate it occupies, but simplifies the connection of any generator or load to the system — “obviously giving a great advantage in terms of the speed at which we can integrate renewables into the grid”.
The smaller footprint of digital substations also facilitates placement and control of renewable resources and storage devices as they’re added to neighbourhoods, incorporated in smart cities and built to power industrial sites. 
Vetter gives Deutsche Bahn, Germany’s railway operator, a massive electricity user that runs its own power infrastructure, and Australian mines, as examples of operations to which energy is critical. He says both these kinds of energy users/producers will increasingly seek to ensure reliability is maintained in a renewably powered world, and as such form part of the market for smart digital substations.
Data generated by sensors and devices within the digital substation, showing the responses of equipment to variable renewable energy flows and congestion at times of peak solar generation, for instance, can help utilities and high-energy industrial sites better manage performance of their assets, and also predictively choose when to conduct maintenance that requires downtime.

Hitachi ABB Power Grids modelling shows that its Smart Digital Substation can save utilities millions of dollars otherwise lost due to asset failure in extreme weather events, by determining effective ways of rerouting resources; and by reducing unplanned outages.
The key to continuously and reliably balancing the grid lies in precisely understanding the impacts of everyday weather and cloud cover on renewable energy flows, and being able to forecast load — time of use — with greater fidelity, says Bryan Friehauf, Senior Vice President of Enterprise Software Solutions at ABB Hitachi Power Grids. 
Smart digital substations are the aggregators of such data at a local level, and can ultimately communicate with one another — as smart digital infrastructure becomes more ubiquitous — to coordinate responses on a larger scale.
Vetter adds that data flowing from smart digital substations can also help utilities remotely manage responses to irregularities or failures in substation systems, reducing the number of site visits required for diagnostics and repair, and thereby reducing the carbon emissions generated by driving today’s internal-combustion-engine service vehicles to site.
