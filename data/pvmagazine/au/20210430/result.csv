The subject of steady global attention over the last few months, it is being alleged that forced labour among China’s Uyghur population, a Muslim-minority, is being used to produce polysilicon, the primary feedstock in the production of crystalline silicon solar modules.
China dominates the global supply of polysilicon, half of which originates from the Xinjiang region – an area that has been linked to problematic state-run labour programs. The region also has very cheap coal, which is also used to power energy-intensive polysilicon production.
China has strenuously denied the allegations, suggesting the accusations are an attempt by rivals to sabotage the country.
Unsurprisingly, the goings on in the Xinjiang region, and particularly in its polysilicon factories, are veiled by secrecy, with information very hard to come by. Nonetheless, the murky working conditions in Xinjiang, at times surely mixed with the desire to be less dependent on Chinese PV supplies, has proven reason enough for some governments and solar companies to begin taking steps to shift the supply chains. 
The United States, European Union, United Kingdom and Canada have all put new sanctions on China over alleged human-rights abuses relating to its Uyghur population. The U.S. has already banned imports of cotton and tomatoes from the region, and it is suspected polysilicon may be next. Dutch political parties have brought the forced labour issue to parliament, while the European Commission is working on due diligence legislation and is expected to bring in new rules around importing products that may be linked to severe human rights violations.
No such stir can be seen here in Australia.
Australia’s solar industry is overwhelmingly reliant on China. And around 80% of solar panels installed in Australia are sourced from China, according to the Clean Energy Regulator. As John Grimes, Chief Executive of the Smart Energy Council, notes, the Australian solar industry interconnection with the country runs deep and has many tendrils.
“There’s been such deep engagement, right back to the 1970s and 80s when the young Chinese students here were studying at UNSW, the whole formation of the industry and the engagement between the two sides ever since, including a lot of research that’s happening in Australian institutions and being commercialised in China,” Grimes told pv magazine Australia.
In fact, he sees the solar industry as a beacon of hope in our increasingly tense relations with the country.
Grimes said it is imperative Australia approaches the forced labour allegations with a “level head.”
“In a heightened political atmosphere, the opportunities to make accusations without supporting information is very high,” he said.
“I have not seen direct evidence. I’ve seen a lot of assertions, but I haven’t seen direct evidence that there forced or slave labour is involved.”
“We don’t discount that [forced labour] is a possibility but ultimately there needs to be a level of credibility and provenience.”
Many governments and solar industry groups do not seem to share Grimes’ reservations. Media outlet Bloomberg claims when its reporters visited the Xinjiang region, they were trailed by Chinese officials, who obstructed their attempts to speak to locals and deleted their photos.
Grimes takes a cautious approach: “I just think we need to proceed judiciously, I think we need to proceed with cool head, but ultimately if there were credible evidence that was tabled, then that would have serious implications. And I think we as an industry, as an industry peak body, would be obliged to act on that.”
Australia’s peak industry body, the Clean Energy Council, told pv magazine Australia that it had established the Risks of Modern Slavery Working Group last year. “The working group is a platform for our members to share best-practice across the clean energy sector in identifying and reducing the risks of forced labour in the supply chain,” a spokesperson for the council said.
The Council did not go into details on if the working group had identified any particular risks or taken subsequent actions. It did, however, note that the Customs Amendment Bill 2020 (Banning Goods Produced by Uyghur Forced Labour) is the subject of the inquiry by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee currently.
What the cost would be of shifting supply chains, Grimes said, is the “key critical” question. “That is ultimately not a question that I think the Smart Energy Council can resolve.”
“In relation to shifting supply chains – maybe that is going to ultimately be the answer. And maybe these are commercial questions for the companies involved.”
Grimes also noted the shift in supply chain could present an opportunity for Australia. The Australian Council of Trade Unions last week made a similar proposal. It has notably been one of the loudest groups to come out against the allegations, with ACTU President Michele O’Neil telling the ABC: “The treatment of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China, particularly in the Xinjiang region is known to involve human trafficking and forced labour… the federal government and businesses must take immediate action to ensure they are not complicit or profiting from forced labour in Xinjiang or anywhere else in the world.”
O’Neil urged the federal government to invest in solar panel manufacturing in Australia (South Australia is home to one such facility, the country’s lone solar manufacturer). She says this would both reduce both Australia’s involvement in forced labour overseas and create jobs.
“In my view, a succession of Australia politicians should be horsewhipped for not seizing the commercial opportunity of that great innovation that happened here in Australia. It’s because we have this mindset that we don’t manufacture things in Australia and it’s way too expensive, and I think that’s completely not true,” Grimes said of the possibility of moving polysilicon production onshore.
“Certainly silica is extremely widely available globally. Australia does produce some of the highest grade silica in the world.”
Currently, Australia does not produce polysilicon. Both the United States and Europe do though, with their combined output amounting to around a quarter of the global demand. Groups and governments in those regions are advocating supply chains turn to these domestic sources to meet demand.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/30/sungrow-launches-high-voltage-battery-and-hybrid-inverter-for-residential-applications/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INVERTERS,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 30, 2021",Sungrow launches high-voltage battery and hybrid inverter for residential applications,"From pv magazine Global
Chinese power electronics company Sungrow has unveiled a new storage energy solution for rooftop applications that comprises a hybrid inverter and a high-voltage battery.
“The hybrid inverter is initially being launched in Europe and the combination of the inverter with the battery will be launched in Australia,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The high-voltage SBR lithium iron phosphate battery uses LiFePO4 as the cathode material and has a storage capacity between 9.6 kWh and 102.4 kWh, depending on the number of modules.
A three-module device has a capacity of 9.6 kWh, a nominal voltage of 192 V, and DC power of 5.76 kW. Its short circuit current is 1,700 A and the continuous maximum charge-discharge current is 30 A. It measures 625x545x330mm, weighs 114kg, and features a 10-year performance guarantee. The battery uses natural convection as a cooling system.
The hybrid three-phase inverter, called SH5.0/6.0/8.0/10RT, is available in five versions, with nominal AC power output ranging from 5 kW to 10 kW. Depending on this value, the device’s efficiency spans from 98% to 98.4%, and the European efficiency from 97.2% to 97.9%.
The product comes with two maximum power point tracking (MPPT) inputs while its MPPT voltage range is 150-950 V. Its maximum input current (DC) is 25 A and the maximum short circuit current ranges from 32 A to 48 A. It is equipped with IP65 protection, natural convection air cooling, and can be used in projects at altitudes of up to 4,000m, and in temperatures ranging from -25 degrees Celsius to 60 degrees Celsius. It is compatible with lithium-ion batteries and a battery voltage of 150-600 V.
Referring to the Australian rooftop PV market, Sungrow said that the proposed solution can help optimise self-consumption by storing excessive energy in the battery and perform as backup power, offering continuous power supply in case of a grid outage. “Besides, charging from the grid during off-peak and discharging at peak can be profitable. With an increasing number of residential systems connect[ed] to virtual power plant (VPP) networks, the solutions are compatible with multiple devices, benefiting the users from VPP business models immediately,” the manufacturer explained.

With Chinese solar project developer and PV glassmaker Xinyi having this week moved to add battery storage to its solar generation portfolio, its prediction storage would be mandated under the nation’s latest five-year plan has been borne out by the National Energy Administration (NEA).
In stipulating to its subsidiaries and major state-owned enterprises that the proportion taken up by solar and wind power in the national power generation mix must rise to 11% this year, the NEA also ordered the use of energy storage for the first time.
The NEA has told grid companies to provide sufficient network connection points for new solar and wind generation projects, starting with facilities registered in 2019 and 2020. Project capacity planned from this year onwards must include a certain proportion of energy storage capacity, the NEA stated in a notification, following similar moves by some provincial authorities concerned about a lack of grid connection capacity.
The NEA notice setting the 11% renewables target, up from 9.7% last year, requires the proportion of solar and wind in the national power mix to rise gradually to 16.5% in 2025, as part of plans, announced by president Xi Jinping, for China’s carbon emissions to peak this decade and for the country to hit carbon neutrality by 2060.
The state entity also instructed its provincial offices to draw up plans for the consumption of renewable electricity and to work to drive inter-regional power flows.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/30/long-awaited-options-paper-for-electricity-market-redesign-published-sets-course-for-australia-though-coal-plant-subsidy-sparks-controversy/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 30, 2021","Long-awaited design for Australia’s energy transition published, coal plant subsidy stirs outcry","The weight of the task at hand is not lost on the Energy Security Board, which noted in the introduction of its Options Paper for the Post-2025 Market Design: “Managed well, Australia will benefit from a secure and reliable energy future. Managed poorly, our energy future will be less secure, more unreliable and potentially very costly.”
The Energy Security Board was tasked with redesigning Australia’s electricity systems by the government coalition in March 2019, and its shortlist of options follows extensive deliberations with stakeholders. It seeks to define a national path forward for Australia that will give clear direction to energy transition, hopefully providing clarity for markets and areas of focus for governments.
“The scale and pace of change occurring across the [National Electricity Market] cannot be overstated,” the Board said. “We are already exceeding the step change scenario forecast in the Integrated System Plan (ISP) in 2020,” the Board’s Independent Chair, Dr Kerry Schott, added.
Energy Security Board
Over the next 20 years, between 26 GW and 50 GW of large-scale renewable energy is expected to come online in Australia, along with between 13 GW to 24 GW of distributed solar. This, the Board noted, is in addition to existing and committed projects. The colossal scale of incoming renewable energy means between 6 GW and 19 GW of new, dispatchable resources like big batteries will be necessary, also to compensate for the loss of two-thirds of Australia’s fossil-fuel generation plants by 2040.
“Our generation mix is changing fast, but the physics of our power system cannot change in the same way,” Schott said.
She goes on to note that on top of the complicated physics of electricity, each state and territory in Australia has different priorities and risks when it comes to its electricity systems. “We are taking a pragmatic approach to clearing the path for technology to make people’s lives easier while keeping the lights on at the lowest possible cost.”
In the paper, the contents of which are detailed below, the Board tackles four key areas: the retirement of coal plants, system security, the integration of distributed energy resources, and finally transmission and grid congestion. Each of these four categories includes a selection of reforms which were classified by urgency, from immediate to those which can be implemented in the coming years.
The options, some of which are controversial, will be resolved by the middle of the year following a period of six weeks for stakeholder feedback.

Certainly the most controversial of the options put forward by the Board is its “physical certificate scheme” for reliability, which would essentially subsidise coal plants to remain open until their forecast retirement dates.
The thinking which underpins the proposal is essentially that the economic unviability of Australia’s coal fired power stations will see many retire ahead of schedule. In other words, Australian coal will be driven out of the market by economics before it is driven out by climate considerations.
The Board’s proposal to retain the plants is not about keeping jobs (as it often is with governments) but rather about maintaining system stability. Fossil fuel generators still supply the bulk of Australia’s dispatchable electricity capacity. If they all close early due to falling profits, the Board fears Australia’s electricity systems may not have the inertia necessary to keep it stable.
The Board is cognisant that energy storage offers a neat solution to this, but evidently it is concerned the incumbent systems will close before the replacement systems are ready.
Specifically what the Board is proposing are changes to the Retailer Reliability Obligation (RRO), which is a scheme that requires electricity retailers to enter into contacts to provide reliable electricity at predictable prices. The Board is proposing to shift the scheme away from financial contracts (based on prices) towards physical contracts, which would be underpinned by actual capacity to deliver electricity into the market.
Since coal and gas are physical entities that can be burned on demand, the reform would favour and ultimately offer them a pathway to remain in operation even if they no longer provide profits.
The proposed pathway has predictably stirred controversy. It’s important to note here that the Board were not tasked with redesigning the electricity market to cut emissions, but rather to ensure a smooth transition. In the majority of cases, these two prongs comfortably align – here they butt up against one another.
Critics fear such a reform sends mixed signals to the market by subsiding coal even as we declare devotion to renewables. It may also hinder the innovation which could see the market plug the ‘hole’ left by fossil fuels with greener technologies sooner. The Board openly acknowledge these flaws.

The other option the Board has proposed in lieu of subsiding coal stations involves changing only the ‘trigger’ aspect of the Retailer Reliability Obligation. Currently, the obligation only applies if it is ‘triggered’ by analysis flagging a future shortfall. Retailers are then given years to secure contracts to ensure reliability.
The Board is considering canning this trigger rule altogether. This, it says, would incentivise retailers to maintain adequate storage in their portfolios.
The growing role of renewable generation and battery storage in the power system will increase the need for services to maintain system security, the Board notes.
Essential services, therefore, need to be identified and procured “including procurement from non-traditional and new sources,” it says.

The most immediate reform it is proposing here was actually released last week by the Australian Electricity Market Commission, which the Board works with. Last week, the Commission communicated its intention to incentivise new, ultra-fast frequency services in the electricity market.
The AEMC said the fast frequency services will come largely from batteries – but also from wind and solar PV through their inverter systems. These new services will need to respond in two seconds or less – compared with the existing fastest services that operate over timeframes of six seconds. 
In the more distant future, the Board said it has identified a spot market approach for valuing and procuring inertia as a long-term priority, and these will be refined in time as renewable penetration grows.
In this field, it seems the Board is hoping to formally structure many of the shifts already underway in the industry. For instance, emphasis has been put on Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) as a means of lowering the overall cost of electricity in the system.
A number of VPP trails are already underway in Australia, with numerous private companies working to develop them in networks.
In terms of reforms, the Board said a package is already underway which includes “expanding the responsibilities of distributors to hosting distributed generation and storage and introducing technical standards for DER that will assist to ensure the security of the power system.”
Energy Security Board
Renewable Energy Zones remain a priority in the Board’s vision.
It is also considering implementing a system which would make grid congestion information available in real time, in turn paving the way for real time management.
In the longer term, the Board said its preferred solution for grid access reform is to shift to locational marginal pricing and financial transmission rights. “It is a more comprehensive access solution to the issues raised, and it is a well-established model that has been successfully applied in numerous overseas markets for decades.”
While the Board’s option to subsidise unprofitable coal-fired power plants has been received predictably cooly by the renewables industry, groups like the Clean Energy Council have welcomed the Options Paper, saying it sets Australia in the right direction.
Energy Networks Australia have also offered support, with its Chief Executive Officer Andrew Dillon saying that while Australia’s transition poses immediate challenges which must be addressed, it’s important “not to act recklessly.”
“We need to be mindful that the challenges posed by the transition to renewables risk posing additional costs to customers. It is important we don’t over-engineer a one-size fits all system design, but instead adopt a balanced approach that unlocks the opportunities from the energy transition and supports investment as it is needed,” he said. 
The publication of the Options Paper marks the opening of the final feedback phase, in which for the next six weeks stakeholders are able to offer responses to the possible pathways. This feedback period will close in June, and pathways will be finalised ahead of the Board delivering its recommendations to ministers in the middle of the year.
The implementation of the proposals will follow, hopefully setting a new, clearer tone for Australia’s energy transition.

The 42 MW battery project will see CPA design, construct, test, install and commission two batteries for FMG subsidiary Pilbara Energy as part of FMG’s integrated power network in the Pilbara region. 
Much of the workload will be forked off to Pacific Energy subsidiary Hybrid Systems Australia, whose executive director, Michael Hall, said the long-standing remote generation experience of Contract Power combined with Hybrid Systems’ industry leading BESS deployment and network integration expertise demonstrated the industry capabilities that exist within Western Australia and Australia to deliver world class projects.” 
The move is part of FMG’s emissions reduction goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. To do this, FMG’s Energy Strategy includes strong investment in renewables and low emissions energy sources, including almost $700 million in the next stage of its Pilbara Energy Connect program to combine 150 MW of gas-fired generation with 150 MW of solar PV and the aforementioned grid-scale battery. 
The hybrid generation project will provide low cost power to the Iron Bridge magnetite project currently under construction. The battery was previously planned to be 35 MW/11 MWh, but that seems to have risen to 42 MW.

Owned by German renewable energy developer BayWa r.e., the 350,000 solar panel project capable of generating enough electricity to power 40,000 homes, has suffered through an 18-month delay since its construction completion and final commissioning. That is a period almost double that of the construction. 
According to BayWA r.e. Projects Australia managing director Fleur Yaxley, “These delays were driven by complicated grid congestion challenges in the North West Murray region of the National Electricity Market (NEM) grid. Challenges I’m pleased to say we were able to overcome to get the site connected.” 
Yaxley went on to note that an offtake agreement for Yatpool’s generation with business energy retailer Flow Power is already in place, “a reflection of the growing appetite for corporate renewable power purchase agreements. We’re really pleased to be able to help meet this growing demand from businesses for renewable energy.” 
Despite sitting idle through 2020, through a global pandemic no less, maintenance and commissioning work continued. Yaxley thanked BayWa r.e.’s construction partners Beon, consultants WSP and SMEC, Powercor and AEMO for helping to ensure a safe and socially distanced working environment “in very challenging circumstances. This project is a great example of what can be achieved with truly collaborative working.”
Despite the delay, BayWa r.e. remains committed to the Australian market and, according to a statement, “is dedicated to helping the country to meet its target of growing its renewable energy share to 41% by 2030. 
BayWa r.e.’s APAC director Daniel Gaefke said that the company still sees enormous potential in the Australian market “and are keen to demonstrate just how achievable Net Zero is.”
