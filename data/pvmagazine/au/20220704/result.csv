The Department of Industry, Science and Resources said the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led to a surge in the price and export value of many of Australia’s resource and energy commodities over the past three months.
Data published in the June 2022 Resources and Energy Quarterly (REQ) shows that commodities such as lithium, nickel and copper, which are critical for EVs, batteries and the transition to cleaner energy, have achieved record high prices in the past financial year. Combined export earnings of lithium, nickel and copper are estimated to have reached about $23 billion in 2021–22, an increase of 39% from 2020–21.
The value of lithium exports, being driven by surging global EV sales, which doubled to 6.6 million in 2021, are estimated to have reached $4.1 billion in 2021–22 and are forecast to more than double to $9.4 billion in 2023–24.
Australia’s copper export earnings are also projected to lift, up an average 9.3% a year from $11 billion in 2020–21 to $15 billion in 2023–24. Nickel export earnings are estimated at $6.7 billion in 2021–22 but are expected to moderate to $5.7 billion in 2023–24.

Overall, the REQ report forecasts Australia’s resources and energy export earnings to hit a record $405 billion in 2021–22 and are expected to climb to an estimated $419 billion in 2022–23. Export earnings are expected to ease to about $338 billion in 2023–24 as improving global supply pushes commodity prices back to more normal levels.
Australia’s Resources Minister Madeleine King said the fallout from Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine had cut global supply and boosted global prices, but Australia has remained a stable and reliable source of resources and energy.
“Australia’s resources and energy sector continues to underpin Australia’s economy and to support international energy security during the global turbulence caused largely by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” she said.
King said iron ore exports continue to be the strongest performer, although prices have eased since the peak in mid-2021. Total iron ore export earnings are estimated at about $133 billion in 2021–22, reflecting a rebound from cutbacks in China’s steel industry in the second half of 2021.
At the same time, earnings from Australia’s LNG exports are estimated to more than double from 2020–21, to reach $70 billion in 2021–22.
The REQ reports that Australian coal export earnings are also estimated to have more than doubled from the previous year to around $100 billion in 2021–22.
The $405 billion estimate for the 2021–22 financial year is down from the March 2022 REQ forecast of $425 billion, due to flooding and weather disruptions in Australia coupled with ongoing COVID-19 issues with Australia’s workforce and shutdowns in China.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/04/provaris-lodges-submission-for-2-8-gw-green-hydrogen-project/,"HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 4, 2022",Provaris lodges submission for 2.8 GW green hydrogen project,"Provaris Energy, formerly Global Energy Ventures, is forging ahead with plans to develop a 2.8 GW solar farm on the Tiwi Islands off the coast of the Northern Territory (NT) as part of plans to create a massive green hydrogen production facility for export into the Asia-Pacific region.
Provaris is developing green hydrogen production and export facilities on Melville Island, where the hydrogen will be manufactured through the electrolysis of purified sea water and powered by solar PV energy. The initial development will see about 500 MW solar of solar generation installed on the island but Provaris says it could be expanded to 2.8 GW as the renewable hydrogen market expands.
The Tiwi H2 Project is targeting an annual green hydrogen production of 100,000 tonnes, which will be exported to the Asia-Pacific region, with a particular focus on Japan, South Korea, Singapore and China.
Provaris executive director and chief development officer Garry Triglavcanin said the referral submission is the first stage of the NT Environment Protection Authority (EPA) assessment process and has been “developed to demonstrate the Tiwi H2 Project will develop a safe, sustainable and efficient supply chain for exporting green hydrogen in a way that minimises environmental and social impacts”.
Triglavcanin said the referral submission includes technical and engineering studies for elements of the project including the solar site, transmission line, and desalination, electrolysis and compression facilities.

The Tiwi H2 Project comprises a solar precinct to be built on a 2,640-hectare site on the northern tip of Melville Island. This will be connected the green hydrogen production facility at Port Melville by a 30-kilometre long 275 kV transmission line. Green hydrogen produced at the facility will be compressed and loaded onto Provaris’ own fleet of hydrogen-powered and compressed hydrogen carrying ships.
Construction of the project is targeted to commence in 2024 and will likely be undertaken in stages, allowing hydrogen production and export volumes to increase over time in line with customer demand. The first production of hydrogen for export is expected to commence in Q1 2027.
Provaris expects a response from the NT EPA on assessment level in October 2022, and said the Tiwi H2 Project has the potential to be Australia’s first export project of gaseous green hydrogen.
Provaris managing director and chief executive officer Martin Carolan said the referral submission is a significant step forward for the company.
“This is a key milestone for Provaris as we continue to demonstrate the benefits of compressed hydrogen as an export carrier compared to alternatives which require mega-scale and capital as well as energy-intensive processes for conversion to transport and re-conversion back to hydrogen,” he said.
“Our project offers the Northern Territory and Australia a first-mover advantage for the export of green hydrogen into Asia.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/04/victoria-releases-roadmap-outlining-plan-to-shift-from-gas-to-renewables/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 4, 2022",Victoria releases roadmap outlining plan to shift from gas to renewables,"The Victorian government has unveiled plans designed to end the state’s reliance on fossil gas, move the market towards a renewable energy future, slash energy bills for both households and businesses and halve carbon emissions by 2030.
Victoria’s Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said the Gas Substitution Roadmap, published on Saturday, is the next stage in the state’s shift away from fossil gas and towards renewable energy alternatives, including solar PV, that deliver cheaper bills for households and businesses.
“Gas is no longer the cheap fuel it once was,” she said. “We know renewables are the cheapest form of energy and we’re making it easier for Victorian households and businesses to go all electric with more choice and more support.
“Victorians have been at the mercy of private gas companies for too long. It’s time to put gas on the backburner as we help Victorians cut energy bills and halve emissions by 2030.”
Victoria uses more gas than any other state or territory in Australia with more than 2 million households and businesses in the state currently using the fossil fuel. The government, which has set targets to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 as part of its commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, said the fossil fuel contributes about 16% to the state’s greenhouse gas emissions but accounts for only 8.5% of electricity generation.
“It is particularly critical for Victoria to proactively prepare for and manage the shift to renewables because we have the highest use of gas for heating, cooking and hot water in Australia,” the roadmap says. “This transition will involve guiding an orderly decarbonisation of the gas system over the long term. The roadmap represents the start of this journey.”

The roadmap outlines a range of initiatives including the removal of barriers to all-electric homes and new developments by eliminating the current planning scheme requirement that all new developments be connected to the gas network, and the establishment of higher energy efficiency requirements for households.
It also includes incentives for existing households to switch to electric appliances, and outlines discounts for energy-efficient products and support for Victorian households to install solar PV panels, solar hot water and electric heat pumps, and battery energy storage systems, while existing incentives for all residential gas products will be phased out by the end of 2023.
D’Ambrosio said modelling shows that all-electric new homes with solar panels, could save Victorians thousands of dollars each year on their bills.
The government says an existing dual-fuel home with solar panels that upgrades to efficient, electric appliances can save $570 on heating and cooling and $180 on hot water. Completely converting to an all-electric home can save $1,250 per year, in addition to the $950 saving from the existing solar system. Adding a medium-sized battery can also save a further $520 per year.
“People can be saving thousands of dollars if instead of living in a dual-fuel home they go electric,” she said.
The roadmap also outlines the development of frameworks to assist the large-scale uptake of renewable gases and hydrogen, providing industry with the certainty needed to secure investment.

In addition, the state government, which is responsible for approximately 3% of Victoria’s total gas consumption, also said it would look to accelerate its own transition away from the fossil fuel.
Despite the government’s commitment, the roadmap has attracted criticism with green group Environment Victoria saying it lacks clear goals and timelines for the shift away from fossil fuels.
Environment Victoria chief executive Jono La Nauze said the roadmap is a step towards ending Victoria’s dependence on expensive, polluting gas “but lacks urgency”.
“Alarmingly, this roadmap lacks clear goals and timelines and fails to rule out the potential use of dirty fossil hydrogen,” he said. “That really is just the bare minimum.”
Gas industry lobby group Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association was also less than impressed with the roadmap, saying that with more than 60% of the Victoria’s electricity still generated using brown coal, “encouraging consumers to switch to electricity is effectively switching to coal”.

South Australia’s largest members-owned association, with more than 750,000 members, said the acquisition of Living Energy and Lovell Electrical, including its team of 24 employees, would allow it to expand its solar and battery network to cater for business as well as residential customers across the state.
Ben Lovell, former managing director of Living Energy and now RAA Solar and Battery senior manager, said the transaction provided an exciting opportunity.
“Being acquired by RAA and working with its experts fast tracks our opportunities a hundredfold,” he said.
RAA Solar and Battery spokesman Ben Halman said the deal would help facilitate the continued growth of the solar energy company which has enjoyed rapid growth since its establishment.

Halman said solar PV and battery systems sales had increased 76% in the second year of operation and the company is on track to double sales this year with recent events sparking a surge of interest in solar PV and battery energy storage systems.
“The level of enquiries into our range of solar systems jumped 50% after the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) announced a default market offer price rise in May,’’ he said.
“Interest in batteries has also increased since last month’s warning by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) of potential power blackouts in SA.”
Halman said the increase in enquiries was not surprising with householders turning to rooftop solar and energy storage technology in a bid to combat the skyrocketing cost of energy.
“On average people can save between 50 and 75% on their electricity bills – or an average of $1,500 per year,’’ he said.
“As well as saving money on their power bills, solar systems also significantly reduce a household’s carbon footprint, which is great for the environment.’’
South Australian homeowners have been quick to adopt rooftop solar with data supplied by the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) showing more than 300,000 homes already having solar panels installed.

D’Ambrosio said the state government’s $20 million NEJF program maximises investment and employment opportunities for local energy projects to ensure Victoria stays competitive and innovative into the future.
“From the rooftop solar boom to our emerging offshore wind energy sector, Victoria is leading Australia in developing new jobs for a net-zero world,” she said.
“This fund has already created ongoing jobs across Victoria and will continue to drive innovation as we halve emissions by 2030.”
D’Ambrosio said the latest round of funding is targeting projects that increase the uptake of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions, create and support renewable energy jobs in Victoria, utilise local skills and services and deliver social, economic and environmental benefits to communities and businesses across the state.
Projects can include a variety of feasibility studies, business cases and implementation-ready capital works projects. Eligible applicants include commercial-for-profit, not-for-profits, local government organisations and state government statutory authorities.
Previous rounds of NEJF have installed the equivalent to approximately 300 rooftop solar systems, the energy from which is powering community buildings and services with 614 kWh of battery storage. The Totally Renewable Yackandandah Community Battery is among the projects which received funded under round five of the NEJF initiative.
Applications for NEJF round six close on 9 August 2022.

A Chinese-Australian research group has developed a monolithic perovskite-silicon n-type tandem solar cell based on tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) tech for the bottom cell.
“We fabricate the perovskite sub-cell conformally on the damage-etched front surface to mitigate the negative impacts of rough c-Si substrates, thus preventing shunt paths across carrier transport layers, absorber layers, and their interfaces in relevance,” the scientists said, noting that they followed a standard wafering and etching process that is commonly used in the PV industry.
They said this strategy benefits from the synergetic effects of the functional layers and interfaces, while minimising the shunting probability during device fabrication.
They built the 1cm2 cell with a dense hole transport layer based on nickel(II) oxide (NiOx) with a thickness of 10 nm. The research group said this minimises the likelihood of pinholes that can result in shunt paths. PolyTPD, which is an excellent hole transport layer material and an electron-blocking material, was used to passivate the interface between NiOx and the perovskite film, with the aim of reducing the cell’s overall voltage losses.
The researchers used the vacuum flash method to ensure a homogeneous growth of the perovskite films and fabricated an electron transport layer made of tin(II) oxide (SnOx), which was deposited using atomic layer deposition (ALD). They also equipped the cell with an anti-reflection (AR) coating based on silicon dioxide (SiO2) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which purportedly serves as a barrier layer for better stability.
Through ray tracing and device simulation, the academics found that both reflection loss and resistive loss at the subcell level can be optimised to minimise overall power output losses. The measurements also showed that the tandem cell can achieve a power conversion efficiency of 27.6%.
“There is also room for improvement in reducing the parasitic absorption loss,” the researchers said.
They presented their findings in “27.6% Perovskite/c-Si Tandem Solar Cells Using Industrial Fabricated TOPCon Device,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials. The research group includes academics from Australian National University, the Beijing Institute of Technology in China, and Chinese module manufacturer JinkoSolar.
“The methods discussed above could help in the commercialisation of low-cost and efficient perovskite/c-Si tandem solar cells,” the scientists said.

Haryana-based Sanvaru Technology has revealed that it will more than triple its lithium battery manufacturing capacity in India to 400 MWh per year.
The company currently has a 125 MWh/year facility in Sonipat, Haryana, where it makes lithium batteries for the solar storage and electric vehicle segments. Its expansion plans are now underway, and its next factory will be built in Haridwar, Uttarakhand.
“We expect our revenues to cross [$22 million] this year, as we have received letters of intent for orders,” Sunil Bhatnagar, international business director for new and emerging technologies at Sanvaru Technology, told pv magazine.
Bhatnagar said the electric vehicle market is expanding, with two-wheelers and three-wheelers leading sales. For four-wheelers, the electric bus market is quickly emerging as a mode of mass rapid transportation. Another potential segment is e-tractors, which are good for exports, but the domestic market is also coming up now, said Bhatnagar.
In line with current market trends, Sanvaru’s focus is on lithium batteries for EVs. On the solar side, it mainly makes high-voltage energy storage systems. It also makes some batteries for applications such as medical equipment and e-cycles.
“[An] e-bus battery is also in the pipeline, as it’s quite similar to e-truck batteries. Another vertical which is coming up is megawatt-level containerised solutions, where Sanvaru is working on many fronts,” said Bhatnagar.
Sanvaru has a supply base that spans all of India. It also exports batteries to neighbouring countries and markets in Africa.
