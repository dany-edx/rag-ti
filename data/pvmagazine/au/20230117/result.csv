To be carried out in stages over the course of the year, ReNu’s investment could eventually total $1 million, which would see it command a 20% stake in Vaulta.
Vaulta was founded in 2019 by Dominic Spooner, whose inspiration for the company came from frustration over the difficulty reusing lithium-ion battery parts and poor recycling practices.
Answering the dire need for circular designs in new energy technologies, Vaulta has patented streamlined, no-weld battery casings. Its designs involve fewer parts and are optimised for ease of both assembly and disassembly, crucial for cell replacement, reuse and recycling.

While great emphasis has been put on improving battery technologies, Spooner told The Guardian last year that how batteries are actually housed tends to be overlooked.
“Batteries will change our lives in ways that we’re maybe not even totally aware of, but… we can create our own new group of problems if we’re not careful,” Spooner said.
“With 3,300 tonnes of lithium-ion battery waste per year in Australia (estimated to increase by 20% annually) and 2 million tonnes predicted globally by 2030, a technology solution was needed to reduce the creation of battery waste,” he added.
Operating out of a Brisbane garage, Vaulta has seen some major successes since launching, signing partnership deals, supplying  US and European customers, receiving $297,500 to commercialise its technology from a federal grant and generating revenue in FY2022.
“ReNu Energy’s investment will enable us to scale our manufacturing capability and target further sales domestically and into the APAC and North America markets,” Spooner said.
ReNu Energy CEO Greg Watson described Vaulta as having “tremendous potential.”
“This investment opportunity is simply one we could not ignore,” ReNu Energy Chairman Boyd White added.
Vaulta’s battery casing solution serves a “very large addressable market,” White said, noting the technology “works wherever batteries do – from stationary storage and electric vehicles to defence, aerospace, wearable batteries and beyond.”
ReNu’s investment, its fifth such play in Australia, will be funded from existing cash reserves, according to the company. Once $500,000 has been invested as part of the second tranche due by April 13, ReNu will be entitled to nominate a non-executive director to Vaulta’s board.

In November, the consortium announced its $9-a-share cash offer, which continues to represent a significant premium on Origin’s current share prices. At the time, Origin’s board said it would “unanimously recommend” shareholders vote in favour of the $18.4 billion takeover bid, which would rank among the biggest private-equity-backed buyouts of an Australian company.
However, concerns around the deal are growing, given this is the second time the consortium’s exclusive due diligence period has been extended. It was first extended in December, and that period will now push out to January 24.
Origin’s brief statement to the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) offered no reason for why the extension was requested, nor any timeline for when Brookfield and EIG are expected to finalise.
As part of the takeover, the consortium said it planned to divide Origin’s business and invest another $20 billion by 2030 to support the gen-tailer’s transition to clean energy.
In the split, Brookfield would take Origin’s energy generation and retailing businesses while MidOcean would acquire Origin’s gas business, including its 27.5% a stake in Australia Pacific LNG.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/17/lithium-ion-battery-cell-gigafactory-coming-to-geelong/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 17, 2023",Lithium-ion battery cell gigafactory coming to Geelong as US-Australia ties deepen,"Geelong, Victoria – formerly a major Australian auto manufacturing hub – will apparently soon host “one of the world’s largest gigafactories,” according to owner Recharge Industries. At full capacity, the lithium-ion battery cell production facility will generate up to 30 GWh of storage capacity per year.
The aim is to cater to both the electric vehicle (EV) and stationary energy storage markets. But as big as the EV market is set to become, Australia currently doesn’t have any EV manufacturers. It does, however, have a sizeable big battery project pipeline which will soon to be underpinned by a major federal underwriting policy, the Capacity Investment Scheme.
Recharge Industries, founded by New York-based David A. Collard, is part of the portfolio of another of Collard’s ventures, a fund called Scale Facilitation. 
Scale Facilitation describes itself as neither private equity fund nor hedge fund, but rather says it is a “hybrid fund focused on scaling technology.” In an interview with Bloomberg, Collard said he raised funding for Recharge via Scale Facilitation and backers include Australian superannuation funds, asset managers and strategic investors. Recharge has had a base in Geelong, Victoria since 2021.

Accenture has been hired to design and engineer the Geelong gigafactory. Alongside Recharge, Accenture will now move the project into the detailed engineering phase, laying the foundations for construction.
During this period, Accenture will advise on the facility layout, assist in procuring and shipping the required equipment, conduct final tests of all line equipment, and provide ongoing process and product engineering support to improve battery production. 
Equipment for the first 2 GWh production line has already been secured with binding off-take contracts and secured funding, Recharge said, noting the equipment is scheduled to arrive in Australia in May 2023.  
Today, China accounts for a vast majority of lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Australia, on the other hand, is the globe’s leading lithium supplier, and tops that list for a range of other commodities vital for making batteries and other renewable equipment.

Speaking to pv magazine Australia recently, SunWiz founder Warwick Johnston said he has seen a real trend developing in the last year around building local ‘value adding’ capacity for battery markets, which includes things like refining, processing, and manufacturing from Australian-sourced material. 
Australia currently does not have much ‘value add’ capacity, but it is surely growing with a number of lithium and other commodity refining and processing plants coming online in West Australia in 2022.
In terms of onshore lithium-ion battery manufacturing capability – a decidedly more complicated play than processing – there are a number of projects in the works.

For one, Australian company Energy Renaissance is preparing to transfer its lithium-ion battery manufacturing operations into a new $28 million purpose-built facility in the New South Wales Hunter region. Its plant has an initial battery production capacity of up to 300 MWh per annum, with plans to scale the operation up to 5.3 GWh.
In West Australia, developer InfraNomics Technologies and UK battery manufacturer Amte Power have set up a joint venture, Bardan Cells, with the vision of building production facilities in Australia’s “Lithium Valley” around Kwinana, south of Perth. InfraNomics and Amte announced their partnership plans back in 2020, and while there has been some formal movement since then, the project looks to be moving fairly slowly.
The Imperium3 Townsville (iM3TSV) Battery plant in Queensland, of which Magnis Energy Technologies owned a one third stake, had until recently also been on the cards. The Queensland government funded a feasibility study for the 18 GWh battery plant – but it has since been abandoned by Magnis Energy, who quietly announced in early January 2023 that it would no longer be proceeding with the plant.
Moving into other battery storage technologies, Queensland company Energy Storage Industries Asia Pacific is currently constructing a $70 million iron-flow battery manufacturing plant in Maryborough, Queensland, as part of a “deep tech partnership” with US company ESS Inc.

There are a number of other projects seeking to produce downstream materials for the flow battery market, including vertically integrated plays from companies like Australian Vanadium and TNG, though these are more nascent. 
While these projects have surely been in the works for more than a year, the push to localise and “friendshore” new energy supply chains has taken on a new sense of urgency with the shifting geopolitics of 2022, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The move has also been propelled by President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which includes massive funding support to build clean energy manufacturing capability in the US and, seemingly, partner countries like Australia.

While this path defies the logic of securing the cheapest possible products, it helps answer the growing problem of reliability – apparently a priority for the US.
Coming back to Recharge Industries and its manufacturing plans, founder Collard described Australia as the “Saudi Arabia of the new energy age,” to Bloomberg, noting it has all the key critical minerals to power the next 100 years.
With its headquarters in the US, Recharge is reportedly looking to manufacture its batteries in Geelong without sourcing materials from either China or Russia.
Recharge’s technology partner for battery manufacturing is another US company, Charge CCCV, better known as C4V. (C4V is also the technology partner on the Imperium3 Townsville battery plant project.)
C4V will provide Intellectual Property (IP), a qualified supply chain, blueprints and technology concepts for battery manufacturing, Recharge said. It will work closely with Accenture to adapt C4V’s IP to the conditions and requirements of the Geelong manufacturing plant, it added.

The theme of 2023’s Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) is “United on Climate Action Towards COP28,” and judging by the conference’s global attendance and talking points, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is treating the event as a trial run before Dubai hosts the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) from Nov. 30, 2023.
UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, who is also CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC Group) and the chairman of the state’s renewable energy firm Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar), provided the event’s opening address.
The UAE’s decision to name Jaber the chair of the upcoming COP28 discussions recently attracted criticism due to the potential conflict of interest seen in an oil boss heading the climate summit. However, if Jaber’s opening address is anything to go by, the ADNOC CEO and Masdar chairman is capable of wearing many hats, but is also under no illusion as to the urgency of the transition to clean energy.
“We have a full and clear understanding of what is at stake,” said Jaber, adding that climate action was at the heart of UAE’s development strategy. “For us, sustainable development is about never settling for the now. It is always about the next… Because next never stops.”
Jaber went on to state the emirate’s ambition for COP28 to be a “COP of action. A COP where the global north and global south really listen to each other. A COP where we move from goals to getting it done… And a COP where we deliver a new deal on climate finance.”
While ADNOC is one of the world’s major oil companies, it also has a 24% stake in Masdar, and through Masdar the UAE Jaber is overseeing one of the region’s most pragmatic approaches to transitioning a fossil-fuel based economy to a green energy economy.
“The road to net zero represents the biggest market transformation with the greatest economic promise since the first industrial revolution,” continued Jaber. “As we prepare to host COP28 in November, I ask myself: can the world come together to meet the urgency of this moment? Can the world cut emissions in half in the next seven years? My answer is yes.”
The decision to name an oil boss as head of the COP28 summit was always going to court controversy. But among attendees of ADSW there are no shortage of people who see Jaber as uniquely capable for the role. After all, with a hand in both the fossil fuel and renewable energy pots, Jaber may prove a functional intermediary between the waning days of oil and a more sustainable future.

India installed approximately 13,956 MW of solar capacity and 1,847 MW of wind capacity in the 12 months to Dec. 31, 2022, according to JMK Research analysts.
The new solar additions included 11.3 GW of utility-scale solar, up 47% from 2021. Developers added about 1.9 GW of rooftop capacity, down 42% year on year, in addition to nearly 700 MW of off-grid/distributed PV.
Most of the large-scale solar capacity in 2022 was installed in the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu. As of December, the nation had 120.85 GW of cumulative installed renewables capacity, according to India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). Solar energy accounts for around 52% of the overall renewables mix, followed by wind energy at 35%, bio-power at 9%, and small hydro at 4%.
