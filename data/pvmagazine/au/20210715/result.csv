The draft plan is also designed to ensure market participants with large-scale batteries have fewer cost and logistics hurdles to participating in the market.
And in a final ruling also announced Thursday, the AEMC has created a new fast frequency response market to financially reward energy providers that can provide almost instant system stability services when the grid needs frequency control to avoid blackouts.
AEMC chair Anna Collyer said the reforms acknowledge the NEM is no longer a one-way transaction.
“The energy market is moving to a future that will be increasingly reliant on storage to firm up the expanding volume of renewable energy as well as address the growing need for critical system security services as the ageing fleet of thermal generators retire,” she said.
“Within two decades, installed storage is expected to increase by 800%, it will be central to energy flowing two ways.”
The AEMC said the final determination to create a new fast frequency response market is the first in a string of new markets being designed to ensure security for the grid as the energy sector decarbonises.
The new market will provide an income stream for batteries, aggregator and hybrid businesses and other fast responders like solar PV, wind or those offering demand management services able to react within one to two seconds to stabilise system frequency.
“As our energy mix continues to change, we will need these new, ultra-fast options,” Collyer said.
“They’re like an insurance policy for keeping the energy system in balance and avoiding blackouts.”

There are already frequency control ancillary services markets available, but until now, the fastest service was six seconds. The reforms could see response times of one or two seconds, provided by grid-scale batteries.
Mark Chilcote, managing director of Australian lithium-ion battery manufacturer Energy Renaissance, said the proposed changes recognise the role battery energy storage has to play as Australia transitions to a renewables dominated electricity market.
“For far too long, battery storage has not received the recognition it deserves for stabilising Australia’s electricity grid.” he said.
“However, AEMC’s proposed rule changes everything and this will strengthen the business case for battery storage.
“We expect the demand for batteries to increase from homeowners, businesses to utility-scale projects.”
The announcement of the fast frequency response market, which is due to be implemented in October 2023, coincides with the release of a draft energy storage plan which is expected to simplify arrangements for market players that send energy both ways.
By creating a universal category called an integrated resource provider, the same rules will apply to anyone who provides storage or a combination of energy services – whether it be batteries, pumped hydro, companies that aggregate energy from small generation and storage units, or large-scale hybrid facilities that combine different technologies behind the one connection point (like factories with solar PV and a battery).
The AEMC said the proposed change will level the playing field for market participants with energy storage assets.
Market participants with batteries will no longer need to register twice to both draw energy from the grid and send it out.
“For small customers, this will open up opportunities to earn more revenue for their home battery, because they can sign up with innovative new aggregator businesses who will pay them for using their battery at certain times,” the AEMC said.
“At the moment, aggregator businesses can only provide energy one way, but our changes will open up new business models for them.”
Andrew Mears, CEO of Newcastle-based smart-software company SwitchDin, said the new aggregator role will allow home and business owners to get more value from their battery via their retailer’s virtual power plant (VPP).
“It also opens up new opportunities for home and business owners as the customers of electricity retailers, where the retailer or a third party aggregator bids the customer assets for energy market or ancillary services on behalf of asset owners,” he said.
“These aggregators will need to get the best deal possible while also helping to keep the grid stable and rewarding their customers.”
Collyer said the proposed change would work in tandem with existing proposals on DER currently under consideration, which are designed to make home batteries a more attractive way to maximise solar investments.
“It’s also central to the Commission’s plans to make the rules more forward-looking so that they work for technology that hasn’t been invented yet,” she said.
“If we make the rules more elastic to focus on what market service you offer rather than who you are, they will stay relevant in the face of rapid change and support energy innovation.”
A final decision on the battery rule change will be made in October.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/15/spark-reveals-plans-for-2-5-gw-renewable-energy-hub/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 15, 2021",Spark reveals plans for 2.5 GW renewable energy hub,"Spark Investment offshoot Spark Renewables intends to develop a 2.5 GW hybrid wind, solar PV and battery storage project near Jerilderie in the heart of the state’s South-West Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).
The site for the proposed Dinawan Energy Hub is on the route of the planned $2.28 billion Project EnergyConnect, the high-voltage electricity transmission interconnector stretching between New South Wales (NSW) and South Australia.
Spark said the hub is also strategically positioned in relation to the proposed HumeLink, a 500 kV transmission upgrade to increase transfer capacity from the Snowy Mountains hydroelectric scheme, and the VNI West interconnector.
The company, which owns the 100 MW Bomen Solar Farm near Wagga Wagga, said the hub would generate enough electricity to power more than one million average Australian homes per year and significantly offset the impact of coal-fired power station closures in NSW.
Spark Renewables head Anthony Marriner said the proposed project is in the early stages of planning with work to commence on preliminary studies and consultation in the coming months.
“We are only at the start of the development process and the proposed project must undergo a rigorous planning and assessment process which includes environmental studies,” he said.
“We are also committed to extensive community and stakeholder consultation to identify the possible environmental, economic and social impacts, as well as opportunities and mitigation measures.”
While there are no significant commitments in place, it is anticipated that construction of stage 1 of the Dinawan Energy Hub would begin in 2024 with the first operations to commence in 2025.

Spark Infrastructure managing director Rick Francis said the hub will serve as a “corner-stone project” in the South-West REZ and will accelerate the development of new renewable generation in the zone.
“It will unlock significant renewable generation capacity consisting of wind, solar and battery energy storage across NSW in the coming years, providing resource diversity to renewable generation planned in the other REZs,” he said.
“This proposed major new renewable project further underpins the need for new and expanded high-voltage transmission links within NSW and to Sydney which are crucial as the energy transition continues to accelerate in our quest for a sustainable energy future for Australia.”
The Dinawan Energy Hub is part of a major shift for Spark which owns 49% of the major network operators in Victoria and South Australia and a 15% stake in NSW transmission network operator Transgrid.
Determined to capitalise on growth opportunities presented by the transition of Australia’s electricity market to renewable energy sources, Spark is targeting more than $1 billion of investment in renewable energy generation by 2025.
The Bomen Solar Farm, which came online last year, was the first renewable energy asset in the Spark’s portfolio but the company said it has a ~2.2 GW development portfolio of wind, solar, storage and green hydrogen projects.
This includes an 60 MW extension planned for the Bomen Solar Farm as well as a yet to be identified 150 MW solar+storage project and a 350 MW wind farm in NSW along with a massive 600 MW wind farm project in South Australia.
“We are evaluating further opportunities for Bomen Solar Farm, including storage,” Francis wrote in the company’s annual report. “Other areas we are exploring include wind, solar and storage projects across the NEM.”

The proposed legislation, introduced to the House of Representatives last year by Steggall, sought to establish an independent climate change commission to manage emissions reduction targets and to legislate a target of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
The Coalition-led committee examining the climate change bills has however stated Australia’s current approach to reducing emissions is adequate and has recommended the bills not be passed by Parliament.
The committee’s report, tabled on Wednesday, outlines concerns the net zero by 2050 target “would give rise to a series of risks including adverse impacts on the economy, specific sectors and jobs”.
The committee also rejected the proposed commission, declaring it would “steer formal policy decisions away from the Parliament and the Executive to an unelected body”.
Liberal backbenchers Trent Zimmerman and Bridget Archer supported the rejection of the legislation but in a joint response to the inquiry called on the government to “include a national commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050” in a long-term emissions reduction strategy due to be released before the United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Glasgow in November.
“The government should consider the best ways to provide certainty to business and the community in relation to this commitment,” the pair said in an additional statement to the report.
Steggall said she welcomed the duo’s commitment to the net zero target but called on them “actually act in accordance with their views” and vote accordingly.
“Moderate MPs like Trent Zimmerman, like Bridget Archer, they talk a big game on wanting to commit to net zero,” Steggall said.
“But the question really comes down to, when are you going to vote for it? What are you going to do about it?
“What I would really like to see a conscience vote. Open it up. Let’s really see who does want to commit to better climate change action.”

Steggall said she was “disappointed, but not surprised” by the committee’s report, claiming it ignored key evidence from business and industry groups.
“Never has a Liberal government been so out of step with the Australian business and investment community on a key issue as the current government led by Scott Morrison,” she said.
“They are completely out of step with business, investment, the AMA. All sectors came out really strongly during the inquiry to say that this was the framework that would really assist, that would really help give clarity, give investment certainty and ensure that Australia was properly prepared for the reality of climate change and its impacts which are going to be significant.
“The Coalition is completely hamstrung and has no clear climate policy. They are really at the mercy now of the Nationals with Barnaby Joyce and are really holding back any clear vision.”
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said reaching net zero emissions by 2050 is “preferable” but has so far resisted growing international pressure to commit to the target.
Steggall said she would continue to push for the bills to be brought forward for a vote in the House of Representatives.
“We know the vast majority of Australians want more action on climate change, there’s no doubt that net zero by 2050 is a bare minimum commitment, we need to make,” she said.
“What we really need to make is doubling our commitment to 2030.”

Estonia-based hydrogen fuel cell specialist PowerUP Energy Technologies has unveiled a 400 W portable fuel cell-based generator that can be used in off-grid applications.
The generator, dubbed UP400, is sold at a price of €6,500 (AU$10,000) and is claimed to have a minimum lifetime of 5,000 working hours. It operates at temperatures ranging from -20 to 52 degrees Celsius.
The device has a weight of 10kg and is based on a proton exchange membrane fuel cell technology which works in three different steps: first the electrons are stripped from the hydrogen molecules through a catalytic process; then the positively charged protons pass through the membrane to the cathode and the negatively charged electrons are forced through a circuit to generate electricity; and finally, the electrons combine with the protons and oxygen from the air to generate by-products such as water and heat.
The hydrogen is provided by external cylinders and its fuel cells work in parallel with a battery module, with the former acting as the main power source during operation. The solution is claimed to be ideal for sailing and yachting, camper vans or other recreational vehicles, and off-grid homes.
“Whether you own a yacht, a camper van, or need a power back-up for your off-grid home, we have a powerful solution for everyone,” said the company’s CEO, Ivar Kruusenberg. “These smart generators can be combined with batteries, solar panels, or even wind turbines to create a smart grid system.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/15/n-type-perovskite-tandem-cell-hits-27-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SAUDI ARABIA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JULY 15, 2021",n-type perovskite tandem cell hits 27% efficiency,"From pv magazine Global
Standalone perovskite solar cells have made rapid progress in terms of efficiency, with several research devices performing at 25% or better. Many of the best performing devices to date have utilised an n-type, or n-i-p, cell architecture for the perovskite layer.
When it comes to fabricating tandem devices that combine perovskites with a silicon bottom cell, however, the n-i-p architecture comes up against major challenges and many researchers have instead chosen to focus on the p-i-n architecture, with the unfortunate side effect of cutting tandem devices out from some of the most promising research in perovskites.
Scientists led by Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), however, were able to overcome several of these challenges. They demonstrated a tandem cell based on an n-i-p perovskite stacked on top of a silicon heterojunction cell that achieved 27% efficiency. This represents a big jump from the previous record of 22%.
The device is described in the paper Ligand-bridged charge extraction and enhanced quantum efficiency enable efficient n–i–p perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, published in Energy & Environmental Science. The group worked with a layer of a material called amorphous niobium oxide, creating selective contacts that limited the amount of light energy absorbed by the cell but lost as heat.
“Overall, we allowed more light to be captured in the regular structured tandem solar cells, and we converted the absorbed to energy more effectively thanks to our newly developed contacting materials,” explains KAUST researcher Erkan Adin. “With these advancements, we achieved a power conversion efficiency exceeding 27%.”
Having overcome these fundamental challenges, the group soon expects to reach even higher efficiencies with the n-i-p tandem cell technology, also noting that its sees strong potential for use of the cells in solar-driven water splitting for hydrogen production. And the next step for the group will be to scale the devices up to work on ‘full size’ six inch silicon wafers. “At KAUST, we are working to scale up this platform towards the industrial standards of the silicon technology, namely six inches wafers,” Stefaan de Wolf, a leader of the research team, said. “We already develop our tandem technologies on double-side textured SHJ cells, which is today’s industry standards.”
