The design of the OEM Framework was released on the same day that the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) published its Draft 2024 Integrated System Plan (ISP) in which it forecasts most coal-fired power plants will exit the system within the next 15 years.
AEMO said 10 coal-fired power plants had closed in the National Electricity Market (NEM) since 2012 and predicted the remaining coal fleet will shut as much as three times quicker than companies have flagged in their own public announcements.
In its most likely scenario, AEMO said about 90% of the NEM’s remaining 21 GW of coal generation will retire by 2034-35, with the entire fleet to be shut by 2038. This timeframe is five years earlier than envisaged in the 2022 ISP.
The NSW government said the OEM Framework will act as a back-up for the energy transition to ensure the orderly exit of thermal generation in a way that does not adversely impact on reliability and system security needs.
If applied, the OEM Framework would provide “a clear process for governments to manage situations where owners of a coal-fired power station seek to bring forward its retirement date,” the government said.
“It also enables a government to temporarily extend the operation of the power station while new renewable infrastructure comes online, through a voluntary agreement or a direction.”
NSW Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said the government is “committed to getting as much renewable energy into our grid as quickly as possible to meet our emissions reduction targets and provide a reliable supply of clean, affordable electricity.”
“We don’t want coal-fired power stations open a minute longer than needed,” she said. “This framework provides a back-up for the energy transition, to be used only as a last resort where we don’t have enough time to feasibly get new renewables or storage into the system.”
The OEM Framework, which will only apply in jurisdictions where the relevant state government voluntarily opts in, will give state energy ministers the power to delay a closure of the generator by up to three years.
The government said the mandatory operation notice is intended as a measure of last resort to be used where it is unlikely that a negotiated voluntary agreement can be reached and will only be applicable for those generators that advance their closure date in the period from 1 January 2021.
The NSW government said the framework is intended to be a temporary measure that will only be needed while the transition to renewable energy is completed.
The consultation period will be open until 2 February 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/15/fortescue-plugs-in-electric-excavator-as-lineup-of-zero-emission-mining-equipment-expands/,"EV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 15, 2023",Fortescue plugs in electric excavator as lineup of zero emission mining equipment expands,"Mining and green energy major Fortescue has confirmed the first operational electric excavator in Australia has commenced operations at its Cloudbreak mine site in the Pilbara as part of the company’s decarbonisation strategy, which includes replacing its existing diesel-fuelled mining fleet with electrified and green hydrogen powered vehicles before 2030.
The excavator, which was converted from diesel and is now powered by a 6.6 kV substation and more than two kilometres of high-voltage trailing cable, is the first of an initial three R 9400 E electric excavators being delivered by German-Swiss equipment manufacturer Liebherr within the next 12 months.
“The commissioning of this fully electric excavator is a massive achievement by the team and is the first of its kind in Australia for the mining industry,” Fortescue Metals Chief Executive Officer Dino Otranto said.
“We’ve been fortunate enough to work with industry experts who have been using trailing cable for decades, and then repurpose this in our own operations as part of our decarbonisation journey.”
Otranto said the commissioning of the excavator is in line with Fortescue’s aim to eliminate emissions across its mining operations and for all electrified mining equipment to be fuelled by renewable energy., including at the Cloudbreak site which is partially powered by Alinta’s 60 MW Chichester Hub Solar Farm.
“Already, our Chichester operations which include Cloudbreak run partially off solar enabling this first excavator to be powered using renewable electricity,” he said. “Once we decarbonise our electricity grid, all these excavators will be operating on renewable electricity in the future.”
Fortescue is also trialling a battery-electric haul truck and a hydrogen fuel cell haul truck at its nearby Christmas Creek iron ore mining operation.

Fellow miner AngloGold Ashanti is also pushing ahead with its plans to expand the lineup of zero emission mining equipment with the trial of a battery-electric underground mining truck at its Sunrise Dam gold mine site near Laverton, about 1,000 kilometres south of Fortescue’s Cloudbreak operation.
The TH665B truck, delivered by Swedish engineering company Sandvik, is powered by a 354 kWh lithium-iron phosphate battery with the electric driveline delivering 630 kW (858 hp) of power output.
Sandvik said as well as producing zero diesel emissions underground and generating 80% less heat, the TH665B is expected to be up to 25% faster on a 1:7 ramp than regular diesel trucks.
Andrew Dawson, business line manager for load and haul at Sandvik, said one of the standout features of the truck is its patented battery self-swapping system that enables quick and easy battery swap in a matter of minutes, and without any major infrastructure like overhead cranes or other heavy handling equipment.
“It is equipped with AutoSwap, our patented self-swapping system which makes the battery changing process extremely fast and easy, usually taking only three minutes,” he said.
Dawson said data gained from seeing the prototype working in Australian conditions will be invaluable as the company continues to develop its battery-electric range and the TH665B moves into commercial production phase.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/15/coal-all-but-gone-by-2034-under-australias-latest-energy-roadmap/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"DECEMBER 15, 2023",Coal all but gone by 2034 under Australia’s latest energy roadmap,"These are two key findings in the latest roadmap for Australia’s largest grid and electricity market, the National Electricity Market. The draft of a document known as 2024 Integrated System Plan, was released today by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). It lays out a comprehensive path for the next 20 years as we wean ourselves off coal and embrace renewables firmed by storage.
AEMO ensures our energy market runs smoothly, including planning for the transmission needs of the future – and that’s where this blueprint comes in.
Australia’s main grid has historically been based on connecting cheap but polluting coal plants to large cities. As coal plants retire, we need a different grid, drawing renewable power from many different locations, while utilising storage.
Every two years, AEMO releases an updated plan, drawing on detailed modelling and consultation across the energy sector.
Through this process, it arrives at an “optimal development path”. That’s energy-speak for the cheapest and most effective mix of electricity generation, storage and transmission able to meet our reliability and security needs while also supporting government emissions reduction policies in the long-term interests of consumers.
Changes to our national electricity laws to include emissions reductions in its objectives came in effect in November. In response, AEMO is now only using scenarios in line with Australian Governments’ emission reduction targets.
The path laid out in this latest plan is intended to ensure the energy transition already underway will be lower cost, resilient and pragmatic. Importantly, the plan points to where we will need to build important new infrastructure – especially transmission lines – to deliver the new electricity system.

The 2024 plan explores three possible scenarios:
The report suggests the step change scenario is the most likely of these three, closely followed by progressive change.

So what would we see under the step change scenario?
Change – and plenty of it. This scenario forecasts the retirement of 90% of Australia’s remaining 21 gigawatts of coal generation by 2034-35, with the entire fleet retired by 2038. This timeframe is five years earlier than envisaged in the 2022 integrated system plan.
AEMO notes the departure of coal from the grid could be faster still, pointing to higher operating costs, reduced fuel security and high maintenance costs as well as more competition from renewable energy in the wholesale market.

To manage the farewell to coal alongside increased electricity demand from population growth and electrification of transport, we will need to add about 6 GW of grid-scale renewable capacity every year in the coming decade. That sounds like a lot, but we’re currently rolling out almost 4 GW a year. The plan also predicts a major increase in rooftop solar – 18 GW more than in the previous plan.
AEMO’s 2024 plan suggests close to 10,000km of new transmission lines will be needed to deliver this least-cost system by 2050. There is slightly less transmission here compared to the previous plan, due to higher transmission costs, and more power from sources requiring less transmission. Since the last plan, some minor transmission projects have been built, but the timelines for most larger projects have been pushed back.
These delays are partly due to community opposition to new transmission lines. AEMO has now explicitly flagged social license as a key challenge to delivering the new energy system.
The 2024 plan calls for a quadrupling of the grid’s firming capacity, which smooths out peaks and dips in renewable generation and reduces the chance of energy shortages for consumers.
This will come from grid-scale batteries, pumped hydro, coordinated consumer batteries used as virtual power plants – and, perhaps controversially, gas-powered generation.
Under the plan, there will be 50 GW (and 654 GWh) of dispatchable storage, as well as 16 GW of flexible gas.
That’s a significant boost to gas capacity, which was projected to be just over 9 GW of gas capacity under the last plan.
Why do we need this capacity? AEMO pictures these gas plants not as day-in, day-out generators, but as a infrequently used backup to ensure the grid stays reliable and secure.
So this increase in gas power capacity doesn’t actually mean a increase in gas generation, or the amount of gas burnt. In fact, AEMO projects a significant decline in gas power over the short to medium term.

But from 2033, as the last coal is burned in our coal plants, AEMO does expect an increase in gas generation. This may be fossil gas, but some may be hydrogen or biomass-derived gas.
Shifting from regular use to infrequent use as a backup will pose challenges for the existing fossil gas network, AEMO points out.
Does this threaten the clean energy transition? No. If we can banish almost all fossil fuel generation from our main grid by 2034, we will be doing well. Even if this were all fossil gas – which it won’t be – the emissions intensity of Australia’s main grid would be miniscule – around 0.01 tonnes per MWh, or 60 times lower than today.

“The energy transition is a once-in-a-century change to the way energy is generated, stored, moved, and used across the economy,” AEMO said. “As well as the shift from coal to firmed renewables, it will treble capacity to meet future demand, and enable a two-way flow of electricity across the grid.”
The market operator said urgent action is needed to meet consumers’ energy needs for secure and reliable energy, and to achieve net zero emissions targets as the National Electricity Market (NEM) moves away from its traditional dependency on coal-fired generation.
“The plan maps out urgent investment so that homes and businesses continue to access reliable and affordable electricity, both in the coming decade when 90% of coal generation is expected to retire, and beyond to 2050,” AEMO Chief Executive Officer Daniel Westerman said.
“In the next decade, this plan shows the need for 5,000 kilometres of transmission, both new projects and those underway, triple renewable generation and double dispatchable storage, hydro and gas-powered generation.”
The Draft 2024 ISP forecasts that Australia’s remaining coal fleet will close two to three times faster than originally announced with the most likely ‘step change’ scenario – assessed as the most likely scenario for planning activities by AEMO based on input from more than 1,300 industry stakeholders – showing about 90% of the current 21 GW of coal capacity will retire by 2034-35, and all before 2040.
“Our updated analysis shows that Australia’s coal power stations are likely to close earlier than planned, and Australians are electrifying their homes and businesses at a faster rate,” Westerman said.

Overall, allowing for continued growth in energy efficiency, electricity consumption across the NEM is forecast to continue rising from about 195 TWh to more than 420 TWh in 2049-50.
Forecasts show growth in residential consumption increases to 150 TWh by 2050. However, uptake of energy efficient measures offset this increase, resulting in underlying consumption of 110 TWh. Continued growth in rooftop solar further reduces reliance on the grid to only 40 TWh across the year by 2050 – about the same as what it is today.
Business and industry total consumption is however forecast to more than double from today’s 145 TWh to almost 345 TWh in 2050.
AEMO said the transformation of Australia’s energy system is well underway with new investments in renewable generation and storage accelerating but “the need for investment in infrastructure remains urgent.”
Previous iterations of the ISP set an ambitious pace for investment and AEMO said those projects now need to be delivered with “the possibility of replacement generation not being available when coal plants retire real and growing, and a risk that must be avoided.”
The optimal development path (ODP) identified by AEMO in the Draft 2024 ISP calls for investment that would triple grid-scale variable renewable generation to 57 GW by 2030 and increase it seven-fold to 126 GW by 2050.
It would also add almost four times the firming capacity from dispatchable storage, hydro and gas-powered generation to 74 GW by 2050 and support a four-fold increase in rooftop solar capacity reaching 72 GW by 2050, and facilitate the use of consumer-owned batteries and virtual power plants (VPPs) to deliver 27 GW of flexible demand response for the NEM.

AEMO said close to 10,000 kilometres of new and upgraded transmission to connect these assets to consumers will be needed by 2050.
The ODP contains largely the same major transmission projects as in the 2022 ISP. Five committed and anticipated projects are underway for delivery. Five previously actionable projects remain actionable and are advancing, and two future projects have now progressed to actionable status as planned.
Westerman did acknowledge that progress on planned projects is being slowed by factors including community acceptance, cost pressures, supply chain issues, workforce shortages and investment uncertainty.
“While progress is being made, the transition is urgent and faces significant risks if market and policy settings, social licence and supply chain issues are not addressed,” he said.
Clean Energy Council Chief Executive Kane Thornton said the latest draft ISP is a call to action that places the urgent need to support the industry in building new renewable generation and storage in sharp focus.
“This reaffirms renewables are the key to meeting the energy needs of Australian homes and businesses, and our commitment to achieving net-zero by 2050,” he said.
“Renewables lead the pack in providing the most reliable energy at the lowest cost, right now, and into the future.
“The debates around this are effectively over and can now be placed in the category of unhelpful distractions as the renewables industry gets on with the job of building what is required to secure Australia’s future.”
Public consultation will be open on the draft ISP until 16 February 2024, with the final report to be published by 28 June 2024.

Microinverter manufacturer Enphase has officially launched a new 208 V three-phase offering.
The company said that it is also offering a focused support team and design tools for small business solar projects.
It added that system.sized blocks of 200 kW will most efficiently maximise the hardware on a cost-per-watt basis.
Previously, 120 V single-phase residential Enphase inverters could be configured into 208V three-phase commercial systems. However, this required meticulous system design and additional “Q Cables.” The new 208V system offers more flexibility in string design and simplifies installation with a new four-wire 208V Q Cable.
Eric Bergman, Commercial and Industrial Sales Director at Enphase, touted the advantages of the new system to pv magazine USA. Bergman said that installers used to have to “physically land the output of the micros evenly across the three phases of the site.”
Installations also used to require a network protection relay, necessitating an external enclosure. The new IQ8 C&I microinverter comes with the four-wire QD Cable, which integrates phase balancing, V/F ride-through, and loss of phase detection – functions previously managed externally by the Network Protection Relay.
Enphase saie that all hardware and associated equipment will be classified as domestic content, potentially qualifying for the 10% US Inflation Reduction Act tax credit adder. However, the definitive guidance from the Internal Revenue Service is still pending.
US production of the commercial inverter is set to begin in the first quarter of 2024. Enphase is initially focusing on the core functionalities of the 208V equipment, with plans to introduce additional features like grid-tied load support, energy storage integration, and 480V three-phase support in the future.
Bergman noted that a large, skilled workforce is already trained to sell and install these systems.
“Right now, the nation is seeing a bit of a slowdown in residential solar sales. At the same time, commercial solar contractors are having a challenging time finding installation crews,” Bergman said. “The 208 V gear gives both groups multiple opportunities. Residential installers who’ve been installing Enphase their whole careers can be tapped by commercial groups to help them deploy these systems, or sell to small businesses on their own.”

German inverter maker SMA Solar Technology AG plans to build an inverter factory at an unspecified location in the United States.
The factory will likely be operational in 2025 and will have an annual capacity of 3.5 GW.
Discussions are currently underway “with several federal states and potential partners to find the most strategically advantageous production location and the right approach,” the company said, noting that up to 200 new jobs will be created in the first three years
“The US is a key market for SMA, and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offers an extraordinary opportunity for long-term growth,” said CEO Jürgen Reinert. “With this step, we will significantly strengthen our market share in the USA and set the course for SMA’s future growth.”
SMA is also pushing ahead with capacity expansion in Germany, where it plans to reach 40 GW. It said it wants to produce solutions for large PV projects and storage systems from 2025 at its Niestetal site, for use in global markets.
