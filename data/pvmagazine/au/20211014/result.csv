Horse-trading between the Liberals and Nationals is under way, and the government is reportedly set to reveal its climate targets and technology roadmap early next week.
But first, Morrison must secure majority support from the National Party. A few vocal Nationals figures, including Matt Canavan, Keith Pitt and George Christensen, have sought to block or moderate a net-zero commitment.
Some of their concerns are valid – regional Australia will shoulder a big burden in the transition to a low-emissions economy. But the tides of international and domestic affairs are turning. Most government MPs have accepted the inevitable, and the issue will not break the bonds of an enduring Coalition.

The Nationals do have legitimate economic and political reasons for being concerned about a net-zero target.
First, a move away from coal and gas would lead to job losses in regional areas. And the federal government’s policy playbook to support rural and remote areas is extremely thin, relying heavily on spillover economic benefits from agricultural development and mining.
This means the Nationals, as the self-proclaimed regional party, have few economic levers to pull. Retaining mining investment is both politically and, at regional and local scales, economically important.
Second, policy mechanisms such as a price on carbon or caps on greenhouse gas emissions could add to costs for people living in regions, and to agricultural industries such as beef production, where reducing emissions will not be straightforward or cheap.
Third, the Nationals’ opposition is somewhat in line with the party’s ideology and electoral positioning. It has historically pitched itself as a defender of national economic interests and “traditional” industries such as farming and mining.
At the same time, the party has long opposed, on economic and social grounds, post-materialist influences such as deep Green environmentalism.
Finally, the Nationals, along with the Liberals, have successfully used climate change policies to wedge the Labor Party and paint it as part of a supposed Labor-Green axis. This tactic worked well in central Queensland in the last federal election.
So for some Nats, conceding to net-zero might be seen as an ideological capitulation and yet more evidence of their ineffective efforts to stand up for the bush.

The problem for the Nationals resistance movement, however, is that it’s becoming increasingly isolated.
Both the Biden administration in Washington and the United Kingdom government are pressuring Australia to commit to the 2050 net-zero target.
And several jurisdictions, such as the European Union, are considering or planning carbon tariffs on imports from nations without strong climate policies.
In the context of recent shifts in the international policy landscape, railing against such tariffs looks anachronistic.
As National Farmers’ Federation (NFF) chief executive Tony Mahar said earlier this year, “as an industry dependent on exporting, Australian agriculture must be ready to adjust to a more carbon-conscious trading future”.
Domestically, state governments, including those with Coalition incumbents, have shifted to net-zero-type targets. So too have important lobby groups, such as the NFF and the Business Council of Australia.
Meanwhile, moderates in the federal Liberal Party are gearing up to argue for a net-zero plan and against large compensation for particular industries.
All this leaves the Nationals’ resistance movement rather short of influential allies.
Opponents could, of course, roll out the implied threat of breaking the Coalition. But moderate Nationals have hosed down suggestions a net-zero target is a make-or-break issue for the Coalition partners. And historically, Coalition breaks – especially in government – are extremely rare.

Nonetheless, even Nationals in favour of a net-zero target want assurances for the regions and agricultural industries.
An obvious and relatively easy policy response is to ensure new renewable energy projects in the regions deliver local economic benefits, such as through favourable purchasing and employment strategies or even dividend sharing.
Second is to ensure these and other projects continue to drive down electricity costs. This is especially important for energy-intensive agricultural production such as irrigated crop and pasture production. Where possible, regional landholders could receive income from local energy ventures as hosts of, or even partners in, projects.
Third, funding for land-based carbon storage could be expanded.
Australian landholders have made a huge contribution to national emissions offsets over decades, largely through vegetation management which draws carbon from the atmosphere and stores it in plants and soil. Such management has largely been the result of state government regulation preventing land clearing and farmers have historically received little direct benefit in return.
The federal government is now contributing funding for landholders who create land-based carbon sinks under the Emissions Reduction Fund. But the resulting projects have caused local concerns and the carbon storage outcomes are uncertain.
So expanding such schemes will not be easy. It must be done in a way that meets integrity standards, and without alienating local people.
The Morrison government is understandably averse to direct carbon pricing, given the toxic climate politics of the last decade. It’s instead focused on low-emissions technological solutions.
This might lead to new low-emisisons technologies for the regions, such as conversion to renewable energy and innovative transport systems. But there’s no timeline yet for when such technology will materialise.
The Nationals are right to demand detail in the climate policy deal. But the net-zero bandwagon cannot be stopped – at best, the Nationals must settle for perhaps quite modest compensation for their constituents.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/14/states-pave-way-for-morrison-to-beat-2030-emissions-pledge/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 14, 2021",States pave way for Morrison to beat 2030 emissions pledge,"A new report released by independent thinktank ClimateWorks Australia shows the nation is on track to reduce carbon emissions by up to 42% by 2030 on the back of state and territory government policies but the federal government needs to set a target of about 70% to ensure Australia contributes to limiting average global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
The federal government currently has committed to reduce emissions by 26-28% by 2030 and Morrison has expressed his desire for Australia to reach net-zero emissions “preferably” by 2050.
Morrison is expected to unveil an updated policy ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow from October 31-November 12 but internal division within the government has so far prevented him from doing so.
While Morrison and his Coalition colleagues continue to vacillate about a net-zero emissions commitment, ClimateWorks systems lead Rupert Posner said the work being done by state and territory governments shows Australia is capable of meeting global expectations for climate action.
“Current state and territory 2030 emissions reduction commitments give the country an estimated de-facto target of 37-42% below 2005 levels,” he said.
“While this is short of what is needed for the world to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, it is higher than Australia’s current commitment of 26-28%.”

ClimateWorks’ State and territory climate action: Leading policies and programs report focuses on the policies and actions of state and territory governments and shows that “rapid decarbonisation is possible for Australia”, but warns it is only achievable if Australia steps up its ambitions.
“The window for keeping global temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees is narrowing, but the goal is still achievable if ambitious benchmarks of progress are met this decade,” Posner said.
ClimateWorks modelling shows that to meet the Paris goals, Australia must reduce total emissions by between 48-74% by 2030. This would entail renewables generating between 70-79% of the country’s electricity by the end of the decade while electric vehicles (EVs) would need to account for 50-76% of new car sales.
“The good news is that most emissions reduction technologies continue to outperform expectations, and the costs are dropping and will continue to drop as their uptake increases,” Posner said.
“Governments can help put Australia in the fast lane in the race to zero emissions, through mainstreaming low-carbon solutions.”
While the federal government continues to deliberate about its climate policy, all Australian state and territory governments are now committed to net zero emissions by 2050 or earlier.
ClimateWorks said that since the beginning of 2020, states and territories have allocated billions of dollars of funding to emissions reduction measures and have made significant regulatory and legislative changes.
The New South Wales government has set a target of net-zero emissions by 2050, with an interim target of 50% emissions reduction by 2030, matching the ambitions of rival clean energy powerhouse South Australia.
The Australian Capital Territory is aiming to cut its emissions by 65-75% by 2030, while Victoria has legislated to reduce emissions by 45-50% by the end of the decade.
Queensland has announced it will cut emissions by at least 30% by 2030 while Tasmania this week announced it would legislate a net-zero emissions target for 2030.
ClimateWorks estimates the state and territory targets will translate to an Australia-wide renewable electricity target of 55% for 2030, and said governments are taking substantial action to ensure their implementation.
As of July 2021, renewable electricity projects in the pipeline equate to more than 10 GW of new generation and 1.4 GW of new storage.
“Each state or territory in Australia has set a target and introduced an implementation strategy,” Posner said.
“They’ve built important momentum. The country now has the chance to capitalise on this.”
The ClimateWorks analysis comes after a separate report released on Wednesday by the Australia Institute’s Climate & Energy Program shows concern about global warming is at an all-time high, illustrating just how isolated current federal government policy is from community sentiment.
The annual Climate of the Nation benchmark report, which has tracked Australian attitudes on climate change since 2007, shows 75% of Australians are concerned about climate change.
Seven out of every 10 people surveyed (69%) think Australia should set targets and implement domestic action to help limit global warming to 1.5-2°C and achieve net-zero emissions and the vast majority of Australians (82%) support the phase-out of coal fired power stations.
Only 12% of Australians prefer investment in gas to power Australia’s economic recovery, while the majority of Australians (63%) prefer investment in renewables as a pathway for economic recovery.
Australia Institute climate and energy director Richie Merzian said there had been a shift in how Australians see bold climate action, with three in four Australians agreeing it will bring opportunities for new jobs and investments.
“The majority of Australians want the federal government to move now on decisive climate action, rather than wait for other countries to act,” he said.
“Australians have an over-inflated view of the coal and fossil gas sector, when it comes to jobs and tax income. Yet even with this outsized view of the role of the fossil fuel industry in the Australian economy, there is extraordinarily little support for any ‘gas-fired recovery’ and increasing majority support for further renewable power investment.”

Iberdrola Australia chief executive officer Ross Rolfe said under the arrangement, BHP will become the primary customer of the PAREP, which will be Australia’s largest solar-wind hybrid plant once in operation in July 2022.
The arrangement will include a direct link to the generation from the PAREP, which will combine 210 MW of wind with 107 MW of solar to generate an estimated 900 GWh of renewable energy annually, enough to power about 180,000 Australian households each year.
Iberdrola, which also operates the 25 MW / 52 MWh Lake Bonney battery energy storage system in South Australia, said about half of the electricity supplied under the contract will be directly attributable to PAREP, which is expected to be ready to connect to the grid in the coming months after the final wind turbine was installed on site last month.

The contract also includes an “innovative” mechanism which sees BHP acquire 100% of the Large Scale Generation Certificates (LGCs) for the contracted load by 2025.
The deal also includes a retail agreement with Origin Energy, which will facilitate the arrangements.
“We worked very closely with BHP to design these bespoke renewable energy supply arrangements,” Rolfe said.
“Olympic Dam is to be the primary customer for the Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park, a demonstration of their commitment to local procurement and sustainable economic development.”
BHP Olympic Dam asset president Jennifer Purdie said the renewable energy supply arrangement, scheduled to commence on July 1 next year, would contribute to the company’s medium-term target to reduce operational greenhouse gas emissions from its operated assets by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030.
“These arrangements will support an exciting new renewable energy project which will contribute to South Australia’s renewable energy ambitions,” she said.
“Olympic Dam’s copper has an important role to play to support global decarbonisation and the energy transition as an essential product in electric vehicles and renewable infrastructure.
“Reducing emissions from our operations will further enhance our position as a sustainable copper producer.”

The latest deal follows BHP’s inking of a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Risen Energy earlier this year for it to supply the miner’s Nickel West Kwinana refinery in Western Australia with renewable energy from its Merredin Solar Farm.
BHP has also signed a renewable energy PPA with state-owned generator and retailer CleanCo to deliver some of the electricity used across its Queensland coal mine operations.
South Australian energy minister Dan Van Holst Pellekaan said the deal is another step on the state’s journey to cleaner, cheaper electricity for industry, businesses and households.
“The arrangements highlight the good sense of BHP, Iberdrola and other companies getting the generation mix right, including wind and solar farms, grid-scale storage and fast-start gas, to provide cleaner and more reliable electricity,” he said.

The company has also been ordered to pay costs of $5,613.
Werribee Magistrates Court on Monday heard three workers were installing a solar PV system on a 4.5-metre high shed at Werribee South in June 2019 when one of them fell through a skylight to the concrete floor below.
The worker fractured his spine and pelvis and spent more than a week in hospital.
WorkSafe Victoria said there was no perimeter guardrail on the roof or fall protection around the skylight, none of the workers were using a safety harness and a “method statement” did not identify skylights were in the roof.
It also ruled Global Renewable Energy Solutions had in that same year engaged in unsafe practices at four other rooftop solar installation sites at Cobram, Newham, Corio and Truganina.
In the Truganina incident, Worksafe said workers had told management that collapsing roof tiles were compromising their safety but had been directed to keep working because the company needed the money.
Andrew Keen, WorkSafe’s executive director of health and safety, said the company had shown a continued disregard for its workers’ safety.
“This case should serve as a wake-up call to any employer that thinks it can put profits above the safety of its workers,” Keen said in a statement.

The court decision comes after the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) confirmed it is investigating a Perth-based solar module retail and installation business over an alleged $2.5 million fraud involving the federal government’s Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES).
The CER said Australian Federal Police earlier this month executed a search warrant at the business premises as part of an investigation into the alleged falsification of documents required under Western Australian (WA) electrical licensing laws.
The CER – which recently recommended major reforms for Australia’s rooftop solar PV industry, including that it be solely responsible for the enforcement of regulations in relation to accredited installers, retailers and component manufacturers – alleges the false documents were used to gain a benefit under the SRES.
Investigators allege that false documents were created for more than 640 solar panel systems installed across WA since 2018, resulting in the potential wrongful creation of an estimated $2.5 million in small-scale technology certificates (STCs).
The CER said the installer of the solar PV systems is a licenced electrician and accredited under the rules administered by the Clean Energy Council (CEC) but alleges that neither the installer nor the business had the necessary electrical contractor’s licence required under state law.
“We will not tolerate falsification of documents to gain a benefit,” CER executive general manager Mark Williamson said in a statement.
“We expect our continuing investigations in the industry to lead to further civil and criminal action being taken against those attempting to undermine consumers and/or defraud the Commonwealth.”
While the investigation is continuing, the CER said there is no allegation at this stage that the systems installed by the Perth-based business are unsafe or not operating as they should.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/14/australias-largest-solar-supplier-expects-shortfalls-and-up-to-30-prices-hikes-as-global-stock-contest-escalates/,"MARKETS,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,WORLD",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 14, 2021",Australia’s largest solar supplier expects shortfalls and up to 30% prices hikes as global stock contest escalates,"The biggest wholesale solar distributor in Australia, One Stop Warehouse, is expecting supply shortfalls and price increases of up to 30% to shake the market here for at least the next three to six months. While solar module prices have been expected to increase for quite some time because of the surge in raw material and shipping costs, China’s ongoing energy crisis has caused massive manufacturing interruptions, pushing the situation to new heights. 
One Stop Warehouse’s Head of Product Procurement and Marketing, Andy Cheng, told pv magazine that Australia is in a particularly delicate position, competing for stock against Europe and the United States – both of which are far bigger markets and better able to absorb the pricing turbulence.
“I think that’s currently the biggest situation – we’e not just fighting internally, we’re trying to get stock competing with other [global regions],” he said.
Cheng expects Western Australia and South Australia to be the most affected because of their strict Covid-19 border policies which make it difficult to reliably deliver supplies.

Over the last month, China descended into an acute energy crisis fuelled by a number of policy and generation factors. The crisis coincided with a national week-long holiday, which Cheng said has left Chinese solar manufacturers unable to properly assess the situation and recalibrate their pricing and production expectations. “Because [solar industries] have long supply chains, all these manufacturers have to rely on their upstream as well… so they have lots of uncertainly about that, and that’s the whole reason they don’t know how to quote moving forward,” Cheng told pv magazine Australia. In other words, the solar hub has quite literally been left in the dark. 
Future pricing estimations at this point seem to be between 20% to 30%. “They [Chinese solar manufacturers] also indicated prices will increase again in November,” Cheng added, noting those changes will probably affect Australia in January and February.
Cheng additionally flagged the possibility of another price increase between these two periods, though he expects it to be less substantial.
China is the world’s largest solar supplier, dominating not only panel manufacturing but the entire upstream supply chain. Which means the ramifications of the country’s energy crisis combined with shortages of polysilicon and price hikes for solar glass, aluminium and other materials will be felt across the globe. In addition to that, Cheng estimates shipping costs have tripled in the last year, increasing from around US$3,500 roughly per shipping container, up to US$11,500 now.
While Australia is an important solar market for China, it is tiny in comparison to Europe and the United States, and regularly pays less for supplies – leaving us in a particularly vulnerable position in the global race to secure solar stock.
“Europe has bigger demand than Australia, and also their prices are always higher than Australia, so with this supply shortage, they’re willing to pay more. So most of the resources will be shifting to Europe in that case, which makes it even harder for Australia,” Cheng said.
“I think we’ll have a [supply] gap, for sure,” he concluded. 
To secure stock for One Stop Warehouse, Cheng said the company has been offering manufacturers more money than was initially contracted.
Despite already increasing its pricing as of October 1, the company has seen many of its expected shipments either delayed or cancelled in the last month.
Cheng estimates roughly 80% to 90% of One Stop Warehouse’s stock comes from China. While the company is, and has been, trying to diversify its stockists since the pandemic hit, Cheng said it’s faced difficulties as there aren’t many fully vertically integrated solar brands outside China.
SolarQuotes has been following module pricing in Australia closely, noting that as of August this year, pricing had not been significantly impacted. Cheng said the reason for that is largely because while Australia experienced a strong first quarter this year, repeated lockdowns interrupted our second quarter, leaving the country with an oversupply. As the most populace two states, New South Wales and Victoria, emerge from lockdown and lift border restrictions, Australia’s industry is again expected to pick up.
The fourth quarter of the year is usually the Australian solar market’s largest, and for that typically busy period Cheng anticipated supply gaps. He said it is already too late to secure more stock for the quarter. “Q4, only thing we can do is try to secure more stock in Australia, local stock from our suppliers, and also find stock in China. We just need to give them a little bit extra for the shipment costs. That’s what we’re doing for Q4 this year,” Cheng said.
Cheng said there isn’t much solar stock left in the country, and it’s unlikely that what remains will be sold for its original pricing, with many preferring to hold onto what they have.
“All those [Australian] retailers, they knew the price was going up – that’s why they were trying to secure cheaper stock earlier. That’s why there was panic buying on the market. And we can’t blame them,” Cheng said, noting that most companies quote jobs weeks or months ahead of delivery, putting them at risk of working at a loss.
Major EPCs (engineering, procurement and construction companies), Cheng said, have also been approaching One Stop looking for stock – which usually supplies only residential and small commercial companies – a sign of how widespread the shortages already are.
Cheng believes this upcoming turbulence might convince solar companies to pad pricing more in future. “In the past, it was a race to the bottom [in Australia] and everyone was trying to have lower prices than the competition and that’s really not healthy,” he said.
He’s hopeful the market will be able to absorb the shock, and is adamant end users won’t be hugely impacted. “For Australia, we have high electricity prices and the STC subsidies, we can actually absorb it… It’s not a big increase compared to the savings [of having solar].”

Chinese solar module maker Risen Energy has launched its most powerful solar module at Intersolar in Munich, Germany.
The 132-cell NewT@N panel is based on 210 mm n-type monocrystalline multi busbars cells with a half-cut design.
The bifacial module can reach a power output of up to 703.6 W and a power conversion efficiency of 23.08%, the company’s head of distribution, Juan Molinero García, told pv magazine. “Both results were confirmed by TÜV SÜD in Germany.”
The module is available in five versions with a power output ranging from 680 to 700 W and efficiencies ranging from 21.9 and 22.5%. The open-circuit voltage is between 46.70 and 47.17 V and the short-circuit current is between 18.17 and 18.53 A. “The product shares the same features of the Titan series, such as low voltage and high current,” Molinero García went on to say.
The panel measures 2,384 x 1,303 x 35 mm and weighs in at 35 kg. It is built with a white backsheet, low iron, tempered anti-reflective glass and an anodised aluminium alloy frame. It also features an IP68 enclosure and the maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
The panel has a temperature coefficient of -0.32% per degree Celsius and its operational temperature ranges from -40 to 85 degrees Celsius.
The bifacial comes with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 12-year product guarantee. “The module will be produced starting from the second quarter of next year,” Molinero García stated.
Risen launched its first high-power product in May 2020. The company operates several manufacturing facilities in China and is currently developing a 3 GW cell and module factory in Malaysia.
