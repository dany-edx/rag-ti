With the state budget to be tabled on Tuesday, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has unveiled the $2 billion Renewable Energy and Hydrogen Jobs Fund, increasing the existing $500 million Queensland Renewable Energy Fund by $1.5 billion.
“This is positioning Queensland for the future,” Palaszczuk said on Thursday.
“Our government is committed to Queensland becoming a renewables, hydrogen and manufacturing superpower, because it means more full-time jobs across more regions.”
Speaking at the Queensland Energy Forum in Townsville, Palaszczuk said the fund will support government-owned businesses to build, own and operate new renewable energy and storage projects and deliver on a target of 50% renewable energy by 2030.
“It will also fund projects to develop our hydrogen industry, so that we can reduce emissions in the transport sector and export our sunshine and wind energy to the world,” she said.

Palaszczuk said the government had taken renewable energy generation from 7% to more than 20% since gaining office, offsetting 12.6 million tonnes of carbon emissions a year.
Queensland minister for energy, renewables and hydrogen Mick de Brenni said the $2 billion fund would generate manufacturing jobs in the renewables supply chain.
“By 2050, the world will be looking for more than 500 million tonnes of hydrogen every year, and we want to make sure Queenslanders get decent, secure jobs supplying it,” he said.
“There is no reason why solar panels, electrolysers, batteries, wind farm components and new technology can’t be manufactured right here in Queensland.
“This fund will create a pipeline of demand for local manufacturing across the entire value chain, and that means more jobs for Queenslanders.”
Ellen Roberts, national director of community group Solar Citizens welcomed the funding, saying it demonstrated the government was thinking ahead and planning for the eventual decommissioning of the state’s coal-fired power generators.

“Right now we’re seeing Queensland’s coal power stations struggling to remain profitable as more cheap renewables come online, so the smartest thing the state government can do is diversify and invest in the next generation of energy,” she said.
“Investing in clean energy storage, like battery storage, pumped hydro and renewable hydrogen, can create thousands of regional jobs and unlock cheap solar energy at all hours of the day.
“More storage will also ease congestion on the grid so that Queenslanders can keep installing record rates of rooftop solar on their homes and businesses.”
Roberts said a new analysis commissioned by Solar Citizens had found that replacing Queensland’s 7.2 GW of state-owned coal generation with 100% renewable energy would require 7.1 GW of solar PV and 10.1 GW of wind capacity as well as 4 GW/103 GWh of supporting energy storage.
Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) campaigner Jason Lyddieth agreed that the funding commitment would help establish Queensland as a leader in clean energy production.
“This is a significant investment in the move away from coal and positions Queensland to become a big clean energy exporter,” he said.
“It makes sense for Queensland to take advantage of our bountiful sunshine and wind resources to power our own state and drive new export industries like green steel, green aluminium and hydrogen.”

Electrical Trades Union (ETU) divisional branch secretary Peter Ong said it was a significant step and a much-needed investment in Queensland’s energy future but added ongoing investment will be required.
“It’s the right start for Queensland, and I feel we are on the right track with this investment,” he said.
“(But) it is important to remember this is only the first step in a just transition to renewables.”
The announcement comes after the state government earlier this week sent a pumped hydro scheme at Borumba Dam to the planning stage and secured land for a 3 GW hydrogen electrolyser plant near Gladstone.
The government has also committed $145 million to develop renewable energy zones connecting up the 157 MW Kaban wind farm and battery project to be built near Cairns and provided $147 million to build the transmission line to support the Kidston 250 MW pumped hydro storage project in the state’s north.

The last year has seen a decisive pivot towards decarbonisation globally which is extremely positive for zero-carbon technologies. Recent announcements of net-zero targets from China, Japan, South Korea and Canada, along with the US recommitting to the Paris Agreement, show policy momentum to tackle global warming is now unstoppable.  
Green hydrogen is a key beneficiary, with this pivot pushing it to the fore ahead of other methods for producing the gas. In fact, electrolysis-based low-carbon production now makes up 67% of the overall pipeline for hydrogen. 
The EU’s Green Recovery Package announced last year specifically earmarked €150 billion for green hydrogen. This financial commitment was accompanied by specific targets for electrolyser capacity – 6 GW in the first phase between 2020 and 2024, with 40 GW to be installed by the end of the second phase in 2030.  
As a direct result Europe is currently driving growth, representing 79% of the overall low-carbon hydrogen pipeline. However, with 17 countries (including Japan, South Korea and Canada) having announced a hydrogen strategy, roadmap or vision and the global trend towards net-zero targets clear, that dominance is likely to be temporary.  
After a pandemic-related dip in Q2 and Q3 2020, investment in low-carbon hydrogen is once again on the up. At least US$4.5 billion was invested in the hydrogen market in the first quarter of 2021 alone, with 55 projects announced.  
As Dr Graham Cooley, chief executive of electrolyser manufacturer ITM Power, said at our recent Power & Renewables Conference: “The capital markets absolutely understand green hydrogen now… we wouldn’t be where we are today if we didn’t have the backing from the City.” Incentives are needed in the short term to ensure the industry can scale at the pace required, but the interest is already there. 
Low-carbon hydrogen project announcements by quarter, Q1 2017 – Q1 2021 (mmtpa) 
 
The ability to manufacture ever larger electrolysers that can produce green hydrogen at scale is a key factor in enabling rapid expansion of the sector. (ITM Power’s new manufacturing facility has a capacity of one gigawatt per year, for example.) This also has the usual benefits of scale in terms of bringing down costs. Our own estimates are that green hydrogen will be competitive with fossil fuels by 2028 to 2033, assuming a US$30/MWh power price in 2030. 
Until 2019, global estimated electrolyser manufacturing capacity was a mere 200 MW. That has since jumped to 6.3 GW of current announced electrolyser capacity, with 1.3 GW added in Q1 2021 alone and another step up in the announced pipeline. 
Of course, this still represents only a small percentage of the almost 1,000 GW of electrolyser capacity needed by 2050 to meet our demand forecasts. However, the exponential rate of growth in manufacturing capacity is clear and likely to continue. 
Finally, a key advantage of hydrogen is that it acts as a versatile form of storable energy. So-called ‘power-to-X’ – turning electricity into green hydrogen – is crucial to maximising the efficiency of renewable energy sources like wind and solar, which cannot be easily dialled up and down as required.  
As Dr Cooley pointed out: “Electrons are really hard to store, and the best way of storing them is to turn them into a storable product. So, you end up changing the vector from an electron to a molecule – and then being able to store the molecule.”  
Hydrogen is also extremely versatile, making it possible not only to decarbonise areas like transport and heating where renewable energy has potential, but also to decarbonise industrial processes which cannot be converted to electricity.

The research project, which will assess the benefits of agrisolar in terms of operational efficiency and maintenance and also look to increase the sustainability of utility scale solar PV facilities, is being rolled out at the 34 MW Cohuna Solar Farm in northern Victoria.
The 82-hectare solar farm is still in the construction phase and when complete will feature about 87,000 bifacial modules mounted on single-axis trackers.
Enel, in partnership with Agriculture Victoria, has already launched the agrisolar project at the site with plans to identify the best pastoral farming plants that can coexist with solar panels and explore how the spaces between the arrays can potentially be utilised for agricultural production.

The intent is to identify the most suitable types of agricultural activity for the site and to develop solutions which can be integrated into the facility without having to modify the layout of the facility or the density of the panels.
Miriam Di Blasi, Enel’s head of environment and impacts mitigation – innovation, said she is confident the design of the Cohuna Solar Farm could provide a “best practice” for large-scale solar PV facilities worldwide.
“These experiments will produce a huge amount of data that will be compiled in an atlas to support future decisions, enabling new plants to select the best farming solutions and related business models based on the solar technology, the local climate and the analyses of the social, economic and environmental context,” she said.
Much of the land near the Cohuna Solar Farm is home to sheep grazing operations, and while ‘solar grazing’ is proving a popular form of land co-use for large-scale solar, other forms of agrisolar are emerging which support horticulture, viticulture, aquaculture and even cropping activities.
Di Blasi said the Cohuna agrisolar project will seek to identify what low-lying pastures and crops can be grown beneath the modules with wheat, barley and canola among the crops already being grown in the region.

Members of the Agriculture Victoria team visited the Cohuna site in April, marking the beginning of the first phase in the research project which Di Blasi said would be a 12-month “massive monitoring and data-gathering” process.
Di Blasi said the data will be used to identify the best plants for the conditions and sustainable agriculture production. This phase is due to be completed in May 2022 with the data to inform phase two of the project.
The Cohuna plant is the latest site to be added to the research project with Enel, which manages 49 GW at 1,200 sites in 32 countries, already exploring agrisolar opportunities at nine of its solar farms in Spain, Italy and Greece.
Testing at the European sites began in January with the planting a number of vegetables, herbs and legumes.
Werther Esposito, head of Enel Australia, said the Cohuna project aligns with company’s focus of creating shared opportunities, and combining energy efficiency and sustainable use of land.
“We’re proactively working with our local stakeholders to explore how we can contribute to building adaptive and resilient agricultural systems through diversified and sustainable use of land at our project sites,” he said.
The Cohuna Solar Farm is Enel’s second solar PV facility in Australia. Enel, in a joint venture with Dutch Infrastructure Fund, also owns the 275 MW Bungala Solar Farm, near Port Augusta in South Australia.

The electric vehicle transition is about more than just doing away with vehicles powered by fossil fuels. We must also ensure quality technology and infrastructure, anticipate the future and avoid unwanted outcomes, such as entrenching disadvantage.
In Australia, the electric vehicle rollout has been slow, and federal action limited. But some state governments are working to electrify bus fleets, roll out public charging networks and trial smart vehicle charging in homes.
Australia’s world-leading rollout of rooftop solar power systems offers a guide to help navigate the transition. We’ve identified three key lessons on what’s gone well, and in hindsight, what could have been done differently.
Solar systems and electric vehicles are both substantial financial investments. But research into rooftop solar has shown financial considerations are just one factor that guides purchasing decisions. Novelty, concerns about climate change and a desire for self-sufficiency are also significant – and electric vehicle research is producing similar findings.
When considering the electric vehicle rollout, understanding these deeper motivators may help avoid a race to the bottom on price.
About one in four Australian homes has rooftop solar, with almost three million systems installed. Solar companies have often sought to highlight the low price of rooftop systems over other considerations. This has created consumer demand for low-priced, lower-quality products – and led to potentially hundreds of thousands of substandard installations across Australia.
So what are the lessons here for the electric vehicle rollout? First, when planning public infrastructure where electric vehicles can be charged, construction costs should not be the only consideration. Factors such as night-time safety and disability access should be prioritised. Shortcuts today will reinforce barriers for women and people with disabilities and create complex problems down the track.
Like rooftop solar, the point of sale of electric vehicles offers a unique opportunity to teach customers about the technology. Companies, however, can only afford to invest in customer education if they aren’t too stressed about margins.
“Smart” charging is one measure being explored to ensure the electricity network can handle future growth in electric vehicle uptake. Smart chargers can be remotely monitored and controlled to minimise their impact on the grid.
The point of sale is a pivotal moment to tell new owners of electric vehicles that their charging may at times be managed in this way.
The uptake of rooftop solar in Australia has been a raging success. In fact, rooftop solar is now the largest generator in the national power system.
This raises issues, such as how rooftop solar systems will respond to a major disturbance, such as the failure of a transmission line. A large amount of solar power feeding into the grid can also challenge electricity network infrastructure.
In response, electricity networks have implemented changes such as limiting solar exports and therefore, returns to solar system owners, and charging fees for exporting solar.
Such retrospective changes have been unpopular with solar owners. So to maintain reliable electricity supplies, and avoid angering consumers, it’s vital to plan where and when electric vehicles are charged.
If every vehicle in Australia was electric, this would add about a quarter to national power demand. The rise in demand would be greatest near bus and logistics depots and ultra-fast highway chargers.
Timing is key to maximising the use of a network connection without overloading it. For example, if everyone charged their vehicle in the evening after they get home from work, as this would put further pressure on electricity supplies at this peak time.
 
Governments and electricity providers should encourage electric vehicle charging during the day, when demand is lower. This might mean, for example, providing vehicle charging facilities at workplaces and in public areas.
Until Australia’s power grid transitions to 100% renewables, the use of solar energy should be strongly encouraged. This would ensure the vehicles were charged from a clean, cheap energy source and would help manage the challenges of abundant solar.
The question of road user charges for electric vehicles drivers is another example where it’s best to avoid retrospective changes. Such charges are necessary in the long run and best introduced from the outset.
Electric vehicle policy spans many government portfolios: transport, infrastructure, energy, planning, environment and climate change. Nationally, and from state to state, different ministers are in charge.
This makes coordination difficult, and creates the risk of policies undermining each other. For example, one policy might encourage the charging of electric vehicles from rooftop solar, to reduce carbon emissions. But because solar energy is so cheap, this might encourage more private vehicle use, which worsens road congestion.
So policies to encourage electric vehicle uptake should not come at the cost of creating more attractive and efficient public transport networks.
And new technologies can entrench societal disadvantage. For example, the rooftop solar rollout often excluded people who could not afford to buy the systems. Without policies to address this, the electric vehicle transition could lead to similar outcomes.
As Australia’s experience with rooftop solar has shown, successful technology transitions must be carefully planned and attentively steered.
In the case of electric vehicles, this will ensure the benefits to owners, society and the environment are fully realised. It will also ensure a smooth-as-possible transition, the gains from which all Australians can share.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/10/consumers-look-at-off-grid-options-amid-talk-of-tariffs/,"INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 10, 2021",Consumers look at off-grid options amid talk of tariffs,"The Australian arm of South Korean solar module maker Hanwha Q Cells has revealed it is receiving an increasing number of inquiries from installers and residential customers looking at going off grid as policy makers contemplate a raft of changes designed to make room on the grid for more renewables including rooftop solar PV.
Australia’s booming rooftop solar market delivered a record-breaking 2.6 GW of rooftop solar in 2020 while another 4 GW is expected to be installed this year. Despite the benefits, the proliferation of small-scale solar has increased the pressure on grid infrastructure which was built when power only flowed one way.
Accordingly, the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC), the governing body responsible for making the rules for the national electricity market, has unveiled a draft determination on distributed energy resources (DER) designed to ease the pressures on the grid as the boom in rooftop solar continues.
Included in the reforms package is a proposal for a two-way pricing mechanism – labelled by some as a sun tax – which would allow distribution networks to reward DER owners for sending power to the grid during peak demand periods and to charge them for sending power when it is not needed.
Q Cells Australia marketing director Myung Shim told pv magazine the talk about export charges had initiated plenty of discussion in the rooftop solar PV sector with “more and more installers and consumers thinking about going off grid”.
“The level of inquiry around going grid independent – what are the options and alternatives to being dependent on the grid – has been rising and it’s understandable,” she said.
“Even if you don’t understand what all these energy management systems and policy changes are, in the end, if you are asked to pay for something that you didn’t have to pay for in the past by the grid operator or network provider, of course you will think about options.”

Shim said those options include batteries with the proposed rule changes sparking renewed interest in energy storage solutions.
“Contrary to all the research in the energy market, Australians have been putting off buying or installing batteries, but people are now thinking a battery is something they should install soon, not look at as a future investment,” she said.
“Now they are saying maybe I can have this solar system and battery installed and perhaps I can go 100% off grid. I will have my own generated energy, I will maximise my self-consumption and if I have something left over, I can store it and then I can sell it when I can make extra revenue at the most attractive nominal value.”
More than 2.6 million Australian houses already have solar modules installed on their roof, and that number is expected to double in the next 10 years.
Conservative estimates suggest Q Cells commands about 12% of Australia’s annual rooftop solar PV market and Shim, who confirmed more than 85% of the company’s revenue comes from residential and small commercial rooftop, said Q Cells is conscious of its responsibility to help deliver a solution which will allow more small-scale renewables into the electricity grid.

Shim said while talk of tariffs had dominated discussions since the AEMC had released its draft determination, technology will be critical to solving the problem of ‘traffic jams’ on the network.
“It all ties back into technology,” she said. “No matter what, this whole conversation leads to the demand for more sophisticated energy technology.
“On our end, it’s all about making sure we build on our quality hardware and we integrate and work with partners who actually provide the technology that optimises the solar system that is on every household and at the same time helps the grid and network industry players have visibility over the situation on a real-time basis.
“It’s about us as manufacturers trying to really keep up and be aware of trends and changes in the market. Whether it comes from the regulation perspective, whether it be behavioural change from consumers, we need to keep investing, not only on our product level but in technology.
“Not just modules but inverters, gateways, batteries, energy management subscription services all these things that actually make up our solar systems.”
The final determination on the AEMC’s draft rule is due for release next month.

By passing the Hold Point Testing the solar plant has been allowed to feed portions of energy into the grid since May, marking a relatively short delay since the plant first reported export back in December 2020. 
Owned by German investment company Wirtgen Invest, the 323-hectare Glenrowan West facility comprises approximately 375,000 monocrystalline modules installed on single-axis trackers and 48 central inverters. It is expected to generate an estimated 270,000 MWh of solar energy annually, enough to save around 110,000 tonnes of CO2. 
The facility, located about 250km north of Melbourne, is the first renewable energy generator to connect to AusNet’s Glenrowan Terminal Station.
Wirtgen Invest acquired the project rights to Glenrowan West from Overland Sun Farming in July 2019. Construction commenced in January 2020 with Wirsol Energy, the Australian arm of the Wircon Group, and WiNRG delivering the project management services while Signal Energy Australia has taken the lead in engineering, procurement and construction.
In a statement, WiNRG said the scope of their services “had to be adjusted considerably during the construction phase due to the pandemic and we were only able to monitor the project from a distance.” 
Nevertheless, WiNRG continued, “We are convinced that Glenrowan West Solar Farm is perfectly equipped to provide clean solar energy for the next few decades and we hope that all targets will be easily exceeded.” 
Wirtgen Invest hopes to further invest in the Australian solar market.

Spain-based mounting system provider Alusín Solar has launched a new walkway to enable the transit of installers in rooftop PV projects.
Dubbed Carex, the new solution is claimed to be suitable for all installers operating in the rooftop segment but also for all those companies that have industrial equipment installed on their roofs.
“Carex was conceived to provide a professional solution to the transit of people on roofs that are not designed to be walkable,” Alusín Solar said in a statement, adding that the current solutions that are available in the market are rudimentary and artisanal. “With Carex, we have been able to respond to the need for moving [across] the roofs in a safe way for people and for the roofs themselves.”
The commercialisation of the product will start on September 1. The manufacturer invested more than €500,000 to deploy a production line for its manufacturing at its facilities in Avilés, in the Spanish, northern, region of Asturias. “We hope to have it installed by the end of June and at full capacity in mid-July,” explained Alusín Solar CEO Javier Font. He added that, although the company’s workforce has been trained to be able to operate with the new line, more workers will be hired shortly.
Currently, there are 32 people employed by Alusín Solar. “The product was developed in Chile, where the installation of ‘technical corridors’ is mandatory for the installation of solar panels,” Font further explained. “It has not been until 2021 when we have been able to make it a reality.”
