It follows, over the past 12 months alone, IPC approval of RES Australia’s 100 MW Springdale Solar Farm Project; Hanwha Energy Corporation and Green Switch Australia’s 150 MW Jindera Solar Farm; GAIA Australia’s 200 MW Bonshaw Solar Farm and associated 300 MW battery storage project; FRV’s 300 MW Walla Walla Solar Farm; and UPC/AC Renewables Australia’s 720 MW New England Solar Farm and up to 400 MWh of associated battery energy storage.
Each of these projects was referred to the IPC because of strong community objection. 
The Riverina region — host to Springdale, Jindera, Glenellen, Walla Walla and Culcairn, as well as numerous other solar farms — in particular has consistently voiced concerns over the use of agricultural land for large-scale solar generation, and in this case added many other objections, including the heat-island effect of large swaths of solar panels and the difficulty of fighting and controlling the spread of bushfires in fire-prone areas blanketed by such installations and enclosed by security fencing.
In all, 146 objections to the $636.6 million project were received, but the IPC ruled in favour of development on the basis of various arguments, including that the project is consistent with the international, national and regional contexts of reducing reliance on fossil fuels and “encouraging the transition to renewable energy”.
It notes that the project, which has been deemed of State Significant Development (SSD) status, has electrical grid connection at a point of available network capacity (even if the other proposed solar farms in the Local Government Area (LGA) go ahead), and that “the project would generate enough electricity to power over 131,000 homes, and is therefore consistent with the NSW Climate Change Policy Framework and Net Zero Plan Stage 1: 2020-2030.”
The IPC commissioners Andrew Hutton and Professor Zada Lipman added that Culcairn Solar Farm was found to be “consistent with the Department’s Riverina Murray Regional Plan 2036, which identifies the development of renewable energy as a growth opportunity for the region”.
The Culcairn project is expected to generate 350 full-time jobs and 1,546 indirect jobs during construction; and seven full-time positions along with 113 indirect jobs in its projected minimum 25-year operational phase.
In addition, 60% of its development cost is expected to be spent within the Riverina region.
The IPC specifically refuted the heat-island argument, referring to a study carried out by Greater Shepparton Council on Shepparton Solar Farm, saying, “While evidence shows that solar panels can increase air temperatures above solar panels”, the study found “that lateral temperatures drop very quickly from the perimeter of a solar farm, in part due to natural convections which take warm air upwards”.
In fact, it said that within 30 metres of the development footprint, changes in air temperatures would be “negligible”; Neon has planned the solar infrastructure to be more than 30 metres away from adjoining private property boundaries.
On the subject of bushfire risk, the Commission determined that such risks can be controlled by implementing standard fire management procedures and recommendations made by the NSW Rural Fire Service and Fire and Rescue NSW.
Although many objectors to the project had cited inappropriate land use, in the sense that the Culcairn Solar Farm site would occupy 1,351 hectares of “prime” or “priceless” agricultural land; some of the solar farm’s supporters who made submissions described the land as “low lying and prone to water logging (sic)” and far from highly productive.
The commission identified that “the Applicant proposes to manage the land for sheep grazing during the operation of the development and that only 25% of the site would be removed from agricultural production”.
In addition, the IPC makes the point that if all four proposed SSD solar projects in the Greater Hume LGA proceed, they would take up 0.59% of the 335,000 hectares of land being used for agriculture within that area.
It also notes that NSW Land and Soil Capability Mapping had identified the site as having “moderate to severe limitations for some land uses”. That is, it “can support some grazing but requires active management to sustain cultivation on a rotational basis”.
The process of consultation, submissions and investigation is rigorous. And although the granting of conditional development approval may sound familiar in each case the conditions are carefully considered; for Culcairn the conditions have been specifically designed to:
A number of objections to Neoen’s Culcairn project centred around the belief that with the NSW Government having committed to development of Renewable Energy Zones, all renewable development should fall within those zones — Culcairn Solar Farm does not.
The Climate Council emphasises that REZs are a “planning tool” that enhance the ability to coordinate renewable generation with transmission and demand — with the aim of developing an electricity system based on renewables that’s also “reliable, secure, and developed at the lowest possible cost”. 
The REZ concept doesn’t preclude the development of projects outside its declared boundaries that can access available transmission capacity, as Culcairn does, or otherwise manage their impact on the grid — the Culcairn project’s battery component will also support the grid by storing energy generated during the day for grid use in evening peak hours and as otherwise needed.
Neoen says that development of Culcairn Solar Farm will take place in two stages, with the first stage expected to take three years and the second a further 18 months.
It will have the capacity to dispatch 800,000 MWh of clean electricity into the grid each year, displacing 648,000 tonnes of CO2 each year, and have an equivalent effect on carbon abatement as planting 6.5 million trees.

Feasible?
“At the next election Labor is very unlikely to win majority government in its own right,” said Bandt on the weekend, “but with the Greens in balance of power we can turf the Liberals out and take the action voters demand on the climate crisis and economic inequality”.
Getting started on his election campaign in Queensland, Bandt proposed using a massive green energy surplus “to electrify the rest of our economy, grow energy intensive manufacturing sectors like green steel and aluminium and power new export industries in green hydrogen”.
The stretch goal is borrowed from Darren Miller, CEO of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), who confirmed during last week’s Senate Estimates that he stands by an earlier assertion that Australia could in fact generate 700% of its energy needs from renewables.
In an interview this month with pv magazine Australia, Miller said, “Obviously the limiting factor for Australia is that our energy demand in and of itself is not that great. We might be 1% of the world’s supply and demand, but we could maybe supply 5% of the world’s energy.”
Like Bandt (or is it Bandt like Miller?), Miller says that the real opportunity comes in upgrading iron ore for green steel production, whether green steel is made in Australia or in China, “we can still use a lot of our energy to upgrade those ores, which then applies to other minerals like bauxite to alumina, and zinc, nickel and manganese”.
Miller told pv magazine, he thinks Australia should aim for hundreds of megawatts of solar, to produce hydrogen and electricity for industry, and upgrade ores. “We could respond to that export opportunity and I think we can do it at the world’s lowest cost, to become a long-term winner in that space.”
While Miller was channeling trials of technology, and demonstration projects across the renewable-energy spectrum, Bandt was channelling public alarm at the devastation caused by severe weather events — fire and flood — over the past two years, to shift the dial on voter sentiment.
“There’s no time to waste,” he said. “We are in a climate emergency that threatens to catastrophically overwhelm our society and economy.”
Part of his weekend pitch to Queenslanders, who at the last Federal election formed a voter barricade to protect coal-mining jobs against the perceived threat posed by Labor, was the promise of hundreds of thousands of well-paid, long-term jobs in renewables-related sectors, that will enable “workers in fossil fuel industries in Queensland and elsewhere to transition, and farmers to be paid to farm carbon and protect the land”.
Should a Labor/Greens coalition become a reality, Bandt’s requirements of the Labor Party, will include:
In advance of the Greens’ launch of a new “policy vision document”, which may provide a timeframe for achieving the Greens’ 700% renewables target, Bandt simply said, “To unlock this revolution, the government will need to lead the way with public investment.”
