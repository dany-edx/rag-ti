With higher than expected power generation and thermal value – effectively insulation quality – the trials which were set up to prove the viability of solar windows have done just that.
Well timed, the company is actually already installing its solar window glaze technology at a commercial greenhouse in Japan via its licensed distributor, Tomita Technologies.

The greenhouse at the Aqua Ignis Hot Springs tourism resort in Sendai City, Japan will be used to supply produce for the resort. Completion of the solar glazing there is expected over the coming weeks, ClearVue said, with overall completion of the greenhouse and its opening anticipated within the next months.
Back to the Murdoch trials in Western Australia, the company has said Stage 1 is now complete with Stage 2 already getting underway. To that end, ClearVue said it has made “significant upgrades” to the greenhouse systems as part of the second phase and the aim now is to find the “optimum balance” between power generation, thermal efficiency, water savings and maximising plant growth across a wide range of species through adjustment to photosynthetically active radiation light.
The Murdoch greenhouse comprises of three ClearVue glazed rooms and one control room which acts as a baseline from which to measure the performance of the ClearVue product. Of the three ClearVue rooms, one uses the current commercially available ClearVue glazing product while the third and fourth rooms are variants of that product using different amounts of nano- and microparticles to look at optimisation of power generation and impact on plant growth dynamics. 
According to the findings, the ClearVue product generated 5.3 MWh of solar energy over the year from April 19, 2021 to now.

The solar windows also displayed strong insulative or thermal value, proving to be around 2˚C warmer overnight and slower to heat up in the morning. This has a double benefit by minimising electricity usage in the greenhouse, making it more efficient – a feature ClearVue has previously pointed out will be advantageous in the high rise building market it is targeting. 
“The results from the ClearVue Greenhouse at Murdoch have demonstrated the power performance of the ClearVue’s PV glazing both as a power source for the project but also as a significant contributor to energy reduction within the operation of commercial greenhousing where growers are willing to invest into a long-term capital asset that can pay itself back – both financially and from a carbon perspective – something no other greenhouse covering product on the market can offer today,” ClearVue’s Executive Chairman Victor Rosenberg said.
“The recent upgrades made to the greenhouse will offer an even greater insight into the role the ClearVue glazing can play in commercial greenhousing,” he added.
“Whilst the results show that we still have a little work to do in finding the optimum balance between power generation, minimal water use, and optimised light conditions for maximum plant growth – we are confident that we are close to finding this equilibrium point and are looking forward to working with the Murdoch team on the Stage 2 plant science trials but also with Tomita on the commercial greenhouse at Sendai in Japan to round out this work.”

“The Tomita Technologies greenhouse installation is itself progressing very well and will in addition to offering a commercial greenhouse as a reference point it will also serve as a good demonstration of larger sized ClearVue PV glazing performing in a cold-climate real-world setting. We very much look forward to the finalisation of this exemplar project and its opening in the coming months.”

LBPA estimates $540 million in capital investment value for the Gundary Solar Farm project which aims to generate 800,000 MWh of solar energy annually, enough to power 133,000 homes and obviate 640,000 tonnes of carbon emissions, equivalent to taking 213,000 cars off the road. 
Still in its early stages of development, LBPA is now engrossed in a phase of community consultation about the project. The first opportunity for such engagement will be at the Bungonia Country Markets on 30 April. Between Q3 2022 and Q2 2023 LBPA plans to be in the EIS preparation phase. 
In a community factsheet, LBPA said it expected the project to create up to 400 jobs during construction at the Gundary site, through which a 330 Kv powerline runs, enabling easy network connection. 

LBPA says the project “will be assessed under the NSW State Significant Development planning and approvals pathway.” However, the project might also have to navigate some disaffected locals. According to the Goulburn Post, “Landowners southeast of Goulburn say they will fight plans for a large solar farm on ‘prime agricultural’ land.” 
Lightsource BP, which is half-owned by BP, announced in 2021 that it had secured $2.5 billion in revolving credit lines from ten of the world’s biggest lenders to finance its plans to hit 25 GW of solar project capacity by 2025. 
Australia is one of the company’s key markets to reach that goal. In addition to the Gundary Solar Farm, LBPA has numerous other large-scale solar projects in development, under construction, or awaiting commercial operation, including the 200 MW Wellington Solar Farm which will form part of a 600 MW solar PV hub in central-western NSW, the 107 MW West Wyalong Solar Farm and the 214 MW Woolooga Solar Farm in Queensland. 
More projects in their early stages include the 520 MW Goulburn River Solar Farm, the 840 MW Sandy Creek Solar Farm, both in NSW, and Victoria’s 364 MW West Mokoan Solar Farm, the 50 MW Mokoan Solar Farm, and the 90 MW Wanghnu Solar Farm.

The European Commission is examining whether the proposed acquisition of French solar developer RedEn should fall within the scope of its merger regulations.
The EU executive has called for interested parties to submit their thoughts on the proposed €2.5 billion acquisition of the solar company by Australian investor Macquarie Group and Canada’s British Columbia Investment Management Corp.
pv magazine reported in March that the MEAG Munich Ergo AssetManagement division of German reinsurance giant Munich Re is also involved in the Macquarie consortium bid to acquire RedEn.
The developer was formed in 2017 when the solar projects of PV module manufacturer Fonroche Énergie were acquired by French private equity groups InfraVia and Eurazeo. French energy company TotalEnergies was reportedly beaten to the acquisition by the Macquarie bid.
Submissions on the proposed takeover must be submitted to the European Commission by April 23.

An international research group has conducted a comprehensive analysis of all failure modes and vulnerable component faults in grid-connected solar inverters that offers a broad view of all available detection and localisation techniques.
The overview provides, in particular, a classification of various component failure modes and their potential causes in a tabular form and describes different approaches for data preparation and feature mining. It also categorises all fault detection and localisation (FDL) techniques in a tabular manner.
The review includes a list of all wear-out failures such as bond-wire heel cracks, solder fatigue, die-attach degradation and delamination, aluminium reconstruction, substrate cracks, corrosion, electrochemical migration, ionic contamination, and time-dependent dielectric breakdown. It also categorises catastrophic failures such as latch-up, bond-wire melting, avalanche breakdown, electrostatic discharge, and secondary breakdown.
Furthermore, the work analyses the impact of these failures on the performance of solar modules and the inverter themselves, as well as a description of both model-based and model-free FDL approaches and other FDL techniques.  Model-free methods coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) were found to be the most efficient in terms of quantifying the performance parameters. “In addition, AI based techniques provide superior detection and localisation abilities as compared to model-based techniques,” the academics explained. “However, a bottleneck in the direction of AI is that there are very few real-time implementations of AI based techniques.”
Their work was presented in the paper Overview of Fault Detection Approaches for Grid Connected Photovoltaic Inverters, which was recently published in e-Prime – Advances in Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Energy. The research group includes scientists from the Jamia Millia Islamia University in India, the Brno University of Technology in Czechia, and the Aalborg University in Denmark. “The future work is further motivated to include the inductance estimation in current emulators as a part of new fault detection approaches and improve the efficiency under high power operation,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/21/polysilicon-maker-predicts-five-year-shortage-of-solar-raw-material/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,CHINA",MAX HALL,"APRIL 21, 2022",Polysilicon maker predicts five year shortage of solar raw material,"From pv magazine Global
Chinese polysilicon maker Xinte Energy has predicted “a certain shortage in polysilicon production capacity and production volume in the next five years,” as it tries to persuade shareholders to back a CNY 8.8 billion ($1.84 billion) share issuance.
The manufacturer and solar developer, which is owned by electrical equipment company TBEA, wants its investors to back a plan to issue 300 million shares – 17.34% of the stock of the enlarged company. It aims to drum up half the cash required to build a poly fab in Xinjiang capable of producing 200,000 tonnes of the solar panel raw material annually.
Xinte shareholders will vote on the share issuance at an extraordinary general meeting on May 5.
Pointing to booming global demand for solar, Xinte said even with a 100,000-tonne polysilicon fab in Inner Mongolia due to be completed this year, the more than 1 million tonnes worth of solar wafer orders it has received from companies such as Longi and JA Solar mean it has locked up sales for three to five years.
That Inner Mongolia facility will double Xinte’s annual poly production capacity and the company wants to double the number again by June 2024, with a 200,000-tonne, CNY 17.6 billion ($3.8 billion) site at the Changji Zhundong Industrial Park, to be built in two 100,000-tonne stages.
Under the manufacturer’s plans, construction of the 12-month first phase of the Xinjiang fab would start next month, with the second stage built from June next year. The other half of the investment cost will be sourced from “bank loans and other methods,” Xinte said in an announcement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange this week.
Silicon production in Xinjiang is a controversial issue outside China – particularly the topic of whether forced labor is a part of the solar value chain. The US House of Representatives in December drafted the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which proposes banning all imports from Xinjiang unless it can be proven forced labor played no part in their manufacture.
Party plan
Outlining its plans this week, Xinte highlighted the energy-intensity credentials of the “cold hydrogenation technology” to be deployed at its latest proposed manufacturing site.
Shareholders at the May 5 meeting will also be asked to approve changes to the company’s articles of association, which include the formation of a “Communist party” at the business to implement major strategic decisions of the Central Committee of the party and the State Council.
The changes to the articles of association also remove several references to the specific Hong Kong exchange where Xinte Energy is listed and replaces them with references to a generic exchange, hinting that the company may be preparing to move its listing.
