Over the next three years, Coles aims to install 20 MW of solar panels on top of 100 of its stores across Australia, with battery energy storage systems to be installed at about one third of those stores to capture and store excess renewable electricity generated on-site.
Origin Zero Executive General Manager James Magill said Coles’ rooftop solar, batteries, and other controllable energy assets such as in-store heating, cooling and refrigeration systems will be connected to Origin’s VPP, with excess generation used to help ease pressure on the grid during peak periods of demand.
“This is a landmark alliance between two of Australia’s leading retailers across supermarkets and energy which will see the companies co-invest in renewable energy and battery assets to help deliver greater emissions reductions for Coles,” Magill said.
“This also marks Origin’s largest customer aggregation agreement providing frequency control ancillary services (FCAS), allowing us to orchestrate 10 MW of flexible energy use across heating, cooling and refrigeration assets at select Coles stores, which helps to support stable and safe operations of the grid.”
The installation of solar panels is currently underway at six Victorian stores, with Coles anticipating that 20 sites will be completed by next year with installs at all 100 stores to be completed by 2026.
Coles Head of Energy Jane Mansfield said the benefits of the initiative, which builds on the rooftop solar already installed on 87 of the retailer’s Australian stores, will go beyond reducing the group’s electricity consumption from the grid.
“Not only will this investment in renewables help us reduce our emissions, it will also lower our operational costs and allow us to meet more of our energy needs from our own on-site solar generation,” she said.
Mansfield said the initiative is expected to help reduce each participating stores’ electricity use from the grid by about 20% on average and support Coles to achieve its 100% renewable electricity goals by June 2025.

MGA Chief Executive Office Erich Kisi said with the new production line – which will be capable of manufacturing more than 1 MWh of MGA Blocks every day – fast approaching completion, the latest round of investment will enable the company to strategically expand its commercial division and invest in engineering and implementation.
“With the imminent completion of our production line, we’re on track to produce 1,000 blocks per day which can then be assembled into 24/7 renewable energy storage,” he said.
The company is commercialising a ‘miscibility gap alloy’ approach to thermal energy storage, storing heat in blocks made largely from aluminium and graphite and dispatching it to generate electricity.

MGA’s patented thermal energy storage blocks, about the size of a large house brick, consist of small alloy particles embedded within graphite-based blocks enclosed in a fully insulated system. Once heated the alloy particles can store heat for days with minimal energy loss. Heat exchangers are used to absorb heat from the blocks, with the heated gas or fluid suitable for industrial heat applications or to drive a steam turbine to generate electricity.
The company is in the final stages of commissioning a demonstration unit at its Tomago base that it said will provide a tangible example of the thermal energy storage system in action and substantiate its scalability for potential customers and partners.
MGA said the demonstration unit will include modular blocks stacked into large assemblies within MGA-designed thermal energy storage (TES) systems.
“These TES systems are able to store millions of kilowatt hours of energy in a cheaper and longer-lasting way compared to other dispatchable solutions,” the company said. “A stack of 3,700 blocks in our demonstration unit, about the size of a shipping container, stores enough energy to power more than 135 homes for 24 hours.”

Mark Croudace, MGA deputy CEO and chief commercial officer, said there is no shortage of demand for the company’s technology.
“Renewable energy sources come with their limitations, especially when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow,” he said. “Plugging this gap is the reason we exist. MGA Technology is perfectly aligned to generate 24/7 clean steam for harder-to-abate industrial sectors, a rapidly growing very large market domestically and globally.”
The latest funding round attracted support from existing investors including Main Sequence, Varley Holdings, Melt Ventures and New Zealand’s Climate Venture Capital Fund while Understorey Ventures and Australian advisory firm Pollination Group have signed on as new investors.
Pollination CEO Martijn Wilder said MGA’s technology has enormous potential to support the uptake of clean energy in Australia.
“The energy transition for the country’s heavy industry to clean energy is a huge challenge and one that requires us to rethink the way we store energy,” he said. “MGA Thermal provides on-demand zero carbon heat which can decarbonise many industrial uses as well as provide clean electricity generation.”

Perth-headquartered Pilbara Minerals and Sydney-based science company Calix said the processing plant will enable greater value extraction from hard-rock lithium assets by allowing spodumene producers to better utilise mineral resources and move down the battery materials value chain by producing a higher-value intermediate product on-site.
Pilbara Minerals Chief Executive Officer Dale Henderson said the initiative has the potential to be a game changer for the industry, paving the way for more value to be captured onshore at the resource.
“The mid-stream strategy has potential to materially improve the battery materials supply chain for lithium through reduction in carbon energy intensity, reduction in transport volumes and creating more value at the mine site,” he said.
“It has the potential to be a game changer compared to the traditional spodumene to chemicals processing route.”

The joint venture project will utilise Calix’s patented electric calciner technology to produce a low carbon, value-added lithium phosphate product containing 18% lithium, up from 5% to 6% contained lithium in spodumene. Lithium phosphate can be used in lithium iron phosphate batteries as well as in nickel cathode batteries.
Pilbara said the technology, if powered by renewable energy, can cut carbon emissions intensity by more than 80% in one of the most high-energy steps of the lithium battery materials production process.
The plant is designed for a 3,000 tonnes per year production of concentrated lithium phosphate salt, from a 27,000 tonnes per year spodumene concentrate feedstock. First lithium salt production is targeted for the June quarter of 2025, with the project to ramp up to steady state production in the March quarter of 2026.
The estimated construction cost of $104.9 million will be partially funded with a $20 million grant from the Australian government, with Pilbara Minerals funding $67.4 million of the remaining budgeted construction expenditure, while Calix will pay the remaining A$17.5 million.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/03/first-commercial-gravity-based-energy-storage-tower-begins-commissioning/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CHINA,SWITZERLAND,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 3, 2023",First commercial gravity-based energy storage tower begins commissioning,"There are many ways to store energy, from electrochemical batteries, to pumped hydro, to iron-air batteries, to flywheels, and more. Energy Vault has taken a new approach, building towers with electric motors that lift and lower large blocks, making use of gravity’s force to dispatch electricity when it is needed.
The Switzerland and United States-based company announced that it is entering the first phases of commissioning for its first commercial-scale gravity energy storage system (GESS). Slated to be fully grid-interconnected in Q4 2023, the gravity tower will mark the world’s first non-pumped hydro gravity-based storage facility.
The project is located near a wind power facility outside of Shanghai in Jiangsu Province, China. It is a 25 MW / 100 MWh storage system that makes use of the company’s new “ribbon” based lifting systems.
“While this represents a significant milestone, our work in China is just beginning given recent local announcements of multi-GW hours of gravity energy storage buildouts, including projects announced in 2022 supporting China’s ‘Zero-carbon parks’ initiative with Energy Vault’s gravity energy storage technology,” said Robert Piconi, chair and chief executive officer, Energy Vault.
The Energy Vault system, called EVx, has demonstrated round-trip efficiency of about 75% in a demonstration project installed in 2020 in Switzerland. The company said it expects that to be improved to about 80%, placing it in a similar range as pumped hydro storage and even grid-scale batteries.

Energy Vault’s design includes a multi-armed crane tower that lifts composite blocks using an electric (solar-powered) motor. The lifted blocks are stacked, which creates potential energy. As the blocks are lowered, the energy is harvested and dispatched for use.
Energy Vault said the tower’s design is based on the physics of pumped hydroelectric energy storage. However, as a solid “mobile mass,” the composite blocks do not lose storage capacity over time. The composite blocks can be made cheaply, said the company, using excavated soil from the construction site, waste materials like mine tailings and coal ash, and even fiberglass from decommissioned wind turbines.
The tower is controlled by computer systems and machine vision software that orchestrate the charging and discharging cycles. A range of storage durations from two to 12 hours or longer is achievable, said the company. This first commercial installation in China will use a four-hour duration.
The first commercial installation is being built in partnership with Atlas Renewable and China Tianying. A subsidiary company of China Tianying recently announced it formed an agreement with the People’s Government of Huailai County to build an additional 100 MWh gravity energy storage project. Energy Vault said it will provide more details on this expansion during the company’s second quarter 2023 earnings conference call scheduled for August 8, 2023.
“This milestone could not have been achieved without the unprecedented collaboration between the collective teams in the U.S. and China, as the world’s two largest economies have joined forces to meaningfully address climate change. Energy Vault’s breakthrough, innovative technology is on the cusp of playing a critical role in supporting China’s clean energy transition and 30-60 decarbonization policy,” said Eric Fang, chief executive officer, Atlas Renewable.
