“What we know is that nickel will be a critical mineral going forward. It’s critical for batteries and for other sources as the global economy shifts, as we are seeing, to clean energy.”
“We are looking towards smart, targeted, time limited support. This is a short-term issue for what is, in the long term, a very critical industry for Australia,” Albanese said.
Federal Resources Minister Madeleine King placed nickel on the Critical Minerals List last week, giving nickel companies access to financing under the $4 billion (USD2.6 billion) Critical Minerals Facility and critical minerals–related grant programs such as the International Partnerships Program ($40 million / USD26 million).
King said the international nickel price is forecast to stay relatively low through 2024, and for several years to come until the surplus of nickel in the market is corrected.
“In the meantime, this puts further Australian nickel operations at risk and given impacts to our domestic capacity and noting the broader market developments presently unfolding in the nickel sector, I am fully convinced that we must be proactive in addressing the recent developments,” she said.
The West Australian government’s Nickel Financial Assistance Program, announced at the weekend, starts from the March quarter and delivers a 50% royalty rebate for 18-months when prices are below $30,628 (USD20,000) per tonne, repayable over 24-months.
WA Premier Roger Cook said the program will support nickel producers in their hour of need, providing temporary assistance to help with the structural changes to the nickel industry.
“The nickel industry supported almost 10,000 jobs, and generated sales of more than $5 billion last financial year. It is also an essential component of the State’s vision of becoming a global hub for the downstream processing of battery metals.
“We recognise retaining our value-add, critical minerals sector is a key part of our plan to diversify WA and set it up for future success. This is highlighted by our current work to refresh and update the Government’s Future Battery and Critical Minerals Industries Strategy, established in 2019,” Cook said.
Since the critical list was last updated on 16 December 2023, however six operating nickel facilities have either closed or gone into care and maintenance, most recently BHPs Kambalda concentrator scheduled for June, on the back Wyloo’s decision to suspend its Cassini and Northern Operations in May.

1,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/19/action-over-rhetoric-calls-to-see-pms-ambition-followed-with-funding/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",EV FOLEY,2024-02-19,"Action over rhetoric, calls to see PM’s ambition followed with funding","Addressing a black-tie business dinner in the Hunter region of NSW, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the government will look to match clean technology funding currently being seen in the USA, the EU, Japan, and Korea. This, he argued, would allow Australia to be more than just an observer of the global energy transition.
Referencing the United State’s climate legislation, passed in August 2022, the $624 billion (USD520 billion) Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Albanese inferred reliable and affordable clean energy, from solar to green hydrogen to offshore wind could power a new generation of advanced manufacturing and heavy industry, “in our suburbs and our regional centres”.
“There is a huge prize on offer here, across every sector of our economy and in every market in our region. We don’t have to go dollar-for-dollar in our spending. But we can go toe-to-toe on the quality and impact of our policies. Our new Net Zero Economy Authority will be part of that.”
Tim Buckley, the director of Climate Energy Finance, however expressed his fear on LinkedIn that the Australian Government would hide behind the rhetoric that Australia can’t afford to think big, in terms of the scale of the need and the massive intergenerational opportunity.
“Australia is late to the party. BHP has just announced a USD3.5 billion write-down on a business it literally invested $10 billion in, just two years ago, i.e., OZ Minerals, and has been caught with its strategic dunce cap on, again, like it was in US shale gas, and like Rio Tinto was with its Riversdale Coal and Alcan debacles,” Buckley said.
“It is clear China has invested billions over the last five years in Indonesian nickel and nickel refining, flooding the world with oversupply so as to crush the price China has to then pay for its commodity imports.”
Buckley calls for public-private partnerships with world-leading financial majors within and outside of Australia and with global industry leaders, the country’s biggest customers, citing China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Japan’s Panasonic & Mitsui & Co., Ltd., and India’s Reliance Industries Limited as examples.
“Likewise in global solar supply chains, and wind supply chains, and EV and grid infrastructure, and green iron, which means working with China to jointly develop a Greater Asian response to the brilliant EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and Emissions Trading System (ETS).”
“Australia needs to have more public finance support for our leading Australian corporates and that means a $20 billion strategic equity mandate for the Future Fund, and yet more capital support for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF), Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), National Reconstruction Fund (NRF) and Export Finance Australia,” Buckley said.
In response to Albanese’s comments, Kane Thornton Chief Executive Clean Energy Council said the plan for a substantial funding package to respond to the Biden Administrations’ IRA is encouraging but works hand in glove with all tiers of government improving policies aimed at minimising costs and delays.
“Global clean energy capital is on the hunt for the most competitive markets in which to invest, and Australia will need to step up with a bold and far-reaching policy and funding package which can act as a magnet for new investment in a fiercely competitive global environment,” Thornton said.
