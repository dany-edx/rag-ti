The first stage of the company’s demonstration project at the Peel Business Park, a 1,000-hectare site in semi-rural Nambeelup, near Mandurah in Western Australia, was energised in August 2020 with a grid connection from the South West Interconnected System (SWIS). Full integration of the microgrid’s 1.2 MW ground-mounted solar generation (installed) and 2.5 MWh battery storage system is expected to be completed in early 2021.
Peel Renewable Energy is a subsidiary of Tasmanian gas distributor and energy retailer, Tas Gas, and was previously part of the Enwave Australia group that developed the Tonsley District Energy Scheme in Adelaide, South Australia.
Rob Breden, General Manager for Peel Renewable Energy in Western Australia, told pv magazine, that the traditional approach to developing industrial estates has been to build multimillion-dollar lead-in grid electricity infrastructure, the full capacity of which might not be utilised for many years, until lots are sold or tenanted and businesses build their facilities and ramp up operations.
“A microgrid approach allows for a more staged and fit-for-purpose deployment of services infrastructure to match the particular objectives of developers,” says Breden.
DevelopmentWA, the land development agency of the Western Australian Government, wanted to bring the skilled workforce of the area, which has become the gateway to the Peel agricultural region, together with innovative new or relocated businesses, and sought a cost-effective approach to delivering energy to its new estate.
“As part of Transform Peel, and as an innovative industry hub in its own right, Peel Business Park will play a crucial role in supporting economic and employment growth and building resilience within the Peel region for generations to come,” said WA Regional Development Minister Alannah MacTiernan in December 2020 when she announced the opening of the first 16 hectares of the site.
Stage 1 of the Peel Business Park is expected to generate 250 ongoing jobs and contribute $73 million to the local economy, as it becomes home to the Shire of Murray’s Western Australian Food Innovation Precinct, a variety of local businesses, and the Department of Fire and Emergency Services’ new Bushfire Centre of Excellence which will open on 25 January.
The estate’s 2.5 MWh battery storage system, scheduled to be commissioned in March, will complete the core of the reliable electricity system that is contracted to deliver a minimum of 50% of its output to the Peel Business Park from renewable sources.
As demand from onsite businesses grows, Peel Renewable Energy will lease rooftop space from occupants, to sustainably and “sensibly” grow electricity supply, says Breden, adding battery storage as needed, and providing energy at a mandated 30% discount on Western Australia’s published state-regulated tariffs.
As part of its business Peel Renewable Energy has obtained licenses for both distribution and retailing of electricity in the Peel Business Park estate.
“It’s taken a little more than two years,” says Breden “and has involved extensive stakeholder engagement by a great team of people, including technical, legal and compliance experts.”
 Peel Renewable Energy is not limited to a 50% supply of renewables says Breden, “It can be more; the good thing is that this is a scalable and flexible model.”
For example, if in five years time, due to technology, pricing or load profile, it makes sense to provide renewable energy from a source other than rooftop solar, Peel Renewable Energy is in a position to deliver the most efficient generation available.
“Where you locate those assets is all about what makes commercial sense at any point in the future — it may be that we put in another ground-mounted solar farm by renting an additional lot in the estate.”
In the meantime, energy customers are guaranteed grid-quality, low-cost, 50% renewable electricity supply that will grow to suit their needs, without having to finance, install and manage their own rooftop generation.
“All electrcity distribution and generation assets in the microgrid will be owned and operated by Peel Renewable Energy,” says Breden.
Unsurprisingly, Breden reports that delivery of the concept has captured the interest of a number of other developers keen to reduce the cost of grid connection, and entice tenants with the availability of low-cost renewable energy.

One of the world’s largest solar manufacturers, Trina Solar, last week became the first photovoltaic company to achieve dual certification from UL, a global independent safety-science organisation that sets industry standards for new products, and EPD Italy, which records compliance with international standards of environmental performance. 
The International Energy Agency estimates that solar PV will account for a third of the world’s total energy generation by 2030. 
With a mandate to produce “clean” energy, manufacturers of solar products are under pressure to ensure their supply chains, factories, transportation, product longevity and recycling practices are constantly reviewed for opportunities to step up efficiencies and reduce environmental impact.
“Trina solar will spare no efforts to further resolve the contradiction between technological development and resources consumption,” said Bo Cao, Trina Solar Deputy General Manager, at a recognition ceremony held in the city of Changzhou, in China’s Jiangsu Province where Trina Solar is headquartered.
GlobalData ranged Trina Solar third in the world in terms of gigawatts of solar modules shipped in 2019; its 9.7 GW came in behind JA Solar at 10.3 GW and the leader Jinko at 14.2 GW. 
Shipping figures for 2020 are yet to be released, but Trina Solar’s third-quarter reports released in November last year saw a year-on-year 18.66% increase in realised income.
Last year the company launched a number of high-performance modules in the bifacial and large-format categories to the global market. They included the Vertex bifacial 500W-plus modules, Duomax V and Tallmax V, and the Trina Pro Mega, another 500W-plus offering which is expected to find its biggest market in Australia partly also because of a 8-15% lower balance of system (BOS) cost than the previous Trina Pro range, and mounting systems which can be customised to challenging sites.
Speaking to pv magazine last year, Trina Solar Senior Country Sales Manager for ANZ and the Pacific, Govid Kant said the significance of the shift to 500W-plus modules is in the company’s determination to not only develop new technologies but to bring them to market at large scale.

Trina Solar has long been committed to transparency in its operations. Its philosophy is that reporting via accredited third-party organisations that measure and confirm its performance on key metrics of sustainable manufacturing lets it set goals, track progress and maintain accountability with all stakeholders, from employees to end customers.
The International Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) System was founded by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency in 1998.
It acknowledges that “the market is craving” verifiable life cycle assessment (LCA) data, and its program operates in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards ISO 14025, ISO/TS14027, ISO 14040, ISO 14044 and ISO/TS14067. For construction products in Europe, the EPD programme is also aligned with the European standard EN 15804 and ISO 21930.
The point is, that LCA data within each EPD is verifiable and comparable with that held in another. After issue, EPDs remain valid for five years.
Trina Solar provides photovoltaic products to many utility-scale projects in the European markets and it expects that EPD certification “will become a necessity for bidding throughout Europe and other markets in the future”, the company said in a statement.
With residential rooftop customers in mind, it also refers to recent research showing that more than 60% of European consumers are concerned about the state of the environment, and says “EPD certification provides customers with high-quality environmental product information and underpins Trina Solar’s incessant environmental efforts.”
Such credentials will become passports to European and North American markets, and others by implication.
Trina Solar monitors its annual manufacturing emissions and its carbon footprint, which its website claims has allowed it to reduce electricity consumption by 42% per megawatt of modules produced between 2015 and 2019; and its water consumption by 32% per megawatt over the same period; along with a 46% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
Trina Solar is also a member of PV Cycle, which supports companies in the photovoltaic industry to fulfil waste-management requirements towards tendering for projects, and meeting investor and consumer expectations.
The company’s Chairman, Jifan Gao has said that Trina Solar looks forward to “creating a framework for a future oriented, cleaner, sustainable energy system” that will provide society with a true net benefit from solar energy.

By November 2020 more than 100,000 residential solar installations were attributable to rebates offered by the program.
As it crossed the half-a-million-rooftops rubicon, Victoria also chalked up 15,000 battery installations, with the government calculating that solar on top can save households up to $890 a year on electricity; and they can claw back an additional $640 per annum if a battery is integrated into the system to shift unused daytime generation to night-time supply.
“Victoria has embraced renewable energy — and we want to see these impressive figures rise even higher,” said D’Ambrosio in a statement.
Did you know there are now more than 510,000 small-scale PV systems in Victoria? That's 1 in every 5 homes, including Osman's! Rebates of up to $4,174 are available if you want to be part of the solar revolution #springst https://t.co/6kgMif4l2G pic.twitter.com/GbZfrxGI2r

The $1.3 billion Solar Homes program — which over a period of 10 years is aiming to enable solar on 770,000 homes, boost solar hot water-system installation by 60,000 and support the addition of batteries to 10,000 homes — had a rough start. 
After its launch in August 2018, the program’s staged release of rebate opportunities derailed the efficient rollout of Victorian solar installations which to that point had been running at around 3,500 a month. 
As people who would normally have invested in solar waited to score a rebated package in monthly releases that were capped at 3,333, the installation rhythm became a rollercoaster of peaks and post-release troughs, which caused some solar businesses to close and others to lay off workers. The application process for the rebate was also found to be unnecessarily complicated.

In addition, the program was plagued in its early months by claims that the system was being ‘gamed’ by unscrupulous industry players who had devised ways to ‘harvest’ as many as 50 rebates a minute, leaving slim pickings for the vast majority of installers — a government investigation found no basis to this claim.
Since briefly suspending the program and restarting with revised systems on July 1 2019, the Victorian Government has consistently strengthened the program offering: when applications for rebates on batteries weren’t meeting the number of subsidies on offer, for example, the Government increased the number of postcodes eligible for the rebate.
“Almost 1,900 Victorian households have now applied for a Solar Homes household battery,” since batteries were incorporated in the program in July 2019, says the Minister’s statement. It adds, “fortnightly allocations are being snapped up almost as soon as they go online”.
In its 2019/20 budget the Government added 1000 four-year interest-free loans of $2,225 for eligible applicants to the solar subsidy, such that consumers could install a 4 kW system, worth around $4,450, without having to make any upfront investment.
The current offering stands at $1,850 rebate, and $1,850 interest-free loan for solar panel installations, or up to $4,174 rebate on a household battery system.
Most recently, the Victorian Budget 2020/21 provided $191 million to expand the number of solar rebates available to householders over the coming two years by 42,000; to offer 15,000 solar rebates to businesses; and to provide 17,500 solar batteries over three years throughout Victoria — no postcodes barred.

The revised battery bonanza was perhaps added in response to Peter Walsh, leader of the National Party in Victoria, and MP for Murray Plains, berating the Andrews Labor Government in Parliament last year in June for what he observed as the  program’s bias towards Melbourne postcodes. Walsh said none of the 28 postcodes in his regional electorate where solar systems are widely embraced were included in the list of areas “eligible” for the battery rebate, despite the fact that:  
“The Andrews Labor Government said the battery program targeted designated postcodes with high photovoltaic penetration and population growth. What they meant to say was the battery program targeted designated postcodes with high photovoltaic penetration and population growth – except for regional Victorians.” 
In all, the Victorian Government will make 17,500 battery rebates available over the coming three years to keep up with demand, and D’Ambrosio said yesterday that the recent expansion of the battery program, “will help Victorians store their affordable rooftop energy and boost local solar businesses”.
Once again the Government feels it can confidently predict that the Solar Homes program will create “at least 5,500 jobs” over its 10-year lifetime. Said D’Ambrosio, “Solar is good for jobs, it’s good for the environment and it’s good for bringing down power bills.”
