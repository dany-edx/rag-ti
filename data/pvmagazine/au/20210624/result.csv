The federal government had initially backed plans for the AREH, proposed for development in Western Australia’s Pilbara region, granting the venture major project status last year. New environmental approvals were however needed after the consortium behind the project amended its plans, opting to use renewable energy to produce ammonia for export to Asia, rather than electricity.
The consortium had referred plans to construct a 26 GW solar PV and wind farm near Port Hedland in WA’s north west. The facility would be used to power 14 GW of electrolysers to convert desalinated seawater into green hydrogen with most of the hydrogen converted to green ammonia for export.
Federal environment minister Sussan Ley late last week refused to sign off on the new proposal, saying the expanded plans would have “clearly unacceptable” environmental impacts on threatened migratory species and internationally recognised wetlands.

“The minister concluded that the proposal would have unacceptable impacts on matters of national environmental significance,” a ministerial spokesperson said.
While the determination is a setback, the AREH consortium said it would continue to progress plans for the project and will address fully any concerns in preparing future project referrals.
“The Asian Renewable Energy Hub consortium received notification from the minister for the environment late last week that an environmental referral for the project will not proceed in its current form,” the consortium said in a statement emailed to pv magazine.
“We are now working to understand the minister’s concerns and will engage further with the minister and her department as we continue to work on the detailed design and engineering aspects of the project.”
While the consortium – including Intercontinental Energy, CWP Global, Vestas and the Australian National University’s Energy Change Institute – looks to refine its plans, the federal government’s decision has come under scrutiny in the state parliament this week with Western Australia hydrogen and regional development minister Alannah MacTiernan describing it as very concerning.

“Our government is very concerned and perplexed by the premature rejection of the expanded Asian Renewable Energy Hub project proposal,” MacTiernan said on Tuesday.
“The decision appears to have occurred with no meaningful engagement by the federal government with either the proponent or the state.
“Typically, with complex projects, the federal government would work closely with the proponent and the relevant state government agencies to identify issues of concern and attempt to resolve potential environmental impacts before making a final ruling.
“This does not appear to have occurred on this occasion and the project has been summarily rejected.”
The AREH was granted major project status late last year and in December, the federal government conditionally approved the first stage under the commonwealth’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.
The 15 GW first stage of the project had also secured state government environmental approvals.
On receiving environmental approvals for stage 1, the project proponents made submissions for the expanded 26 GW second stage.
Key revisions from the original project include the addition of processing plants, marine infrastructure including pipelines and an offshore export platform, and a new town to house workers.
MacTiernan acknowledged the expanded second stage of the project had more complex environmental considerations that needed to be worked through but said the decision to reject it “at such an early stage is perplexing”.
“The federal ruling was made just one month after the referral of the project was made,” she said.
“The rapid rejection of this project sends the wrong messages about Australia as a leader in the emerging renewable hydrogen industry, and has potentially far-reaching implications for proponents considering investing in hydrogen in Australia.”
MacTiernan called on the federal government to now work closely with the AREH consortium and the relevant state government agencies to identify issues of concern and attempt to resolve potential environmental impacts before making a final ruling.
“This project has the potential to show just how we can transition away from fossil fuels towards green energy generation,” she said.
“I urge the federal government to work constructively with the proponent to work through any issues of concern.”
The decision to reject the expanded AREH plans follows resources minister Keith Pitt’s decision last month to veto a $280 million loan from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) to develop a wind and battery storage hub in northern Queensland.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/24/net-zero-by-2050-even-if-scott-morrison-gets-the-nationals-on-board-hold-the-applause/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JUNE 24, 2021","Net zero by 2050? Even if Scott Morrison gets the Nationals on board, hold the applause","The Nationals’ leadership spill reportedly followed growing disquiet about Morrison’s slow pivot towards a net-zero by 2050 goal. Many Nationals MPs have indicated they don’t back the target, and Joyce says he will be “guided by the party room” on the issue.
If Morrison eventually gets the 2050 target past Joyce and passed by the joint party room, there will be little cause for celebration. In fact, the achievement will be as exciting as watching a vaudeville magician wrench an old rabbit out of a moth-eaten hat.
Australia’s premiers will yawn in unison. Every state and territory in the country has already adopted this target, or better. Yet at the end of the day, net-zero by 2050 is a risky and inadequate goal, especially for wealthy nations such as Australia.
All G7 states and 11 G20 members are aiming for net-zero emissions by mid-century. These include the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, the Republic of Korea, Italy, the European Union, Argentina and the United States. China, the world’s largest emitter, has committed to net-zero by 2060.
However, as international environment law expert Professor Lavanya Rajamani has argued, net-zero targets should not automatically be applauded. First, they should be checked for their credibility, accountability and fairness. On these measures, a net-zero by 2050 target for Australia is nothing to cheer.
Why? First, because a target is nothing without an effective strategy to get there – something Australia is sorely lacking.
To successfully achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, tough short- and medium-term targets are essential to staying on track. Victoria, for example, has pledged to halve carbon emissions by 2030. The UK is aiming for a 78% reduction by 2035, reflecting its confidence in existing and emerging technologies.
The Morrison government’s 2030 target – a 26-28% reduction below 2005 emissions levels – is not credible. Experts say a 2030 target of between 50% and 74% is needed to put Australia in line with keeping warming below 2℃ and 1.5℃ respectively – the goals of the Paris Agreement.
 
So what about Australia’s actual emissions-reduction measures? The Morrison government’s technology-first approach falls short of what’s needed to drive quick and deep emissions cuts.
Reaching net-zero requires substantial government funding and tax relief for investors in renewable technologies. Morrison’s announcement of an additional A$540 million for new technologies is insufficient and partly misdirected.
For instance, the government is investing in carbon capture and storage. As others have argued, the technology is increasingly commercially unviable and encourages further fossil fuel use.
In the meantime, the government is failing to assist the uptake of proven technologies such as electric vehicles, despite transport being Australia’s third-worst sector for emissions.
Even if Australia adopted a goal of net-zero by 2050, and measures to get there comfortably, the target is risky.
In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a report on the potentially catastrophic impacts of exceeding 1.5℃ global warming. In the same report it established the idea of “net zero” as a global aim, saying achieving the target by 2050 was needed to stay below that warming threshold.
The IPCC described the emissions-reduction pathways required, but failed to emphasise crucial assumptions underlying them. Most depended on “negative emissions” – drawing down carbon from the atmosphere.
Many of those presumed drawdown measures involve land use measures that potentially threaten biodiversity or food security, for instance by requiring farmland and virgin forests to be used for growing “carbon crops”. Others involve geo-engineeering technologies which are yet to be tested or proven safe at scale.
It’s a risky strategy to avoid rapid, substantial and real emissions cuts in favour of gradual mitigation pathways that rely on such future carbon drawdown. It locks us into technologies which are problematic or don’t yet exist. To limit these risks, Australia must aim for net-zero well before 2050, predominantly via actual emissions cuts.
The matter of equity is another where policymakers have been inattentive to nuance. The undifferentiated call for net-zero by 2050 shifts the burden and costs of effort onto poorer countries. No wonder so many developed countries have been happy to adopt it!
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement each require developed countries to cut emissions faster than poorer countries – and to assist poorer countries in their efforts. This recognises the fact developed nations are largely responsible for global warming, and have the wealth and technological capacities to act.
Developing nations such as India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as those in Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Pacific and Africa, are mostly below global average wealth. Forcing them to meet the same net-zero timeframe as rich nations is patently unfair.
And for the international community to achieve even the 2050 goal, China – a global emissions giant – must increase its ambition to at least net-zero by 2050 (rather than its current 2060 timeframe).
It’s clear that rich developed countries must both aim for net-zero emissions well before 2050, and provide climate finance to assist poorer countries to do the same. Anything less will almost certainly guarantee Earth overshoots an already risky target.
Australia, given its wealth and technological means, must certainly aim for net-zero well before 2050. A report in April this year suggested reaching net-zero in 2035, to make a “fair and achievable contribution to the global task” and given our vulnerability to extreme weather.
The issue of climate finance was on the agenda at this month’s G7 summit, but critics say the final commitment – meeting an overdue spending pledge of US$100 billion a year – is inadequate considering the urgency of the task.
Just months out from a crucial UN climate summit in Glasgow in November, Scott Morrison is caught in a bind. On the global stage, he’s under increasing pressure to commit to a net-zero emissions target or face carbon tariffs. At home, he’s forced to assuage a minor coalition partner now led by a man who will reportedly push for a new coal-fired power station, and for agriculture – and potentially mining – to be exempt from emissions targets.
The looming general election will test whether rural voters are prepared to endure Joyce’s climate antics or will swing to savvy independents. And it remains to be seen whether urban voters will tolerate a prime minister whose transactional politics leaves Australia increasingly exposed at home and abroad.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/24/victoria-pumps-5-million-into-ev-charging-network/,"EV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 24, 2021",Victoria pumps $5 million into EV charging network,"In a move designed to accelerate the uptake of electric vehicles (EVs), the Victorian Government has committed $5 million in funding to expand the state’s network of fast chargers to meet an expected surge in demand for zero emissions vehicles.
The government announced the funding package on Thursday, calling for businesses, councils and community organisations across the state to apply for grants to install EV charging stations as it looks to drive the uptake of EVs.
Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change Lily D’Ambrosio said the funding will deliver about 100 new charging stations across the state with regional Victoria to receive 80% of the funding.
The new chargers will range from 11 kW to 100 kW and will include chargers that provide EVs with enough power to drive 100km after 10 minutes of charging.
“This will make it easier for electric vehicle drivers to make the trips they need, knowing that there will be a charging station when they need, where they need,” D’Ambrosio said.
The funding package is the latest initiative rolled out by the Victorian Government after it last month introduced its controversial EV road tax.
The tax, labelled by some as the “worst electric vehicle policy in the world”, will see EV drivers pay a levy for every kilometre travelled on public roads in the state. From July 1, drivers of electric and other zero-emission vehicles will pay 2.5 cent/km while drivers of plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles will pay 2.0 cent/km.
While that policy has attracted widespread criticism, the Victorian Government has continued to roll out initiatives designed to help it meet its target that 50% of all new car sales be zero emission vehicles by 2030.
The $5 million in funding is part of a $100 million package which includes more than 20,000 subsidies starting at $3,000 to help Victorians purchase a zero emissions vehicle and funding to drive uptake across the government and commercial fleet.

Australia has been slow to embrace EVs with data provided by industry body the Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) revealing key barriers include vehicle prices, model availability, and the distance over which they can travel on a single charge.
The lack of access to charging stations is another major roadblock with more than 50% of motorists citing it as a key barrier to the adoption of EVs.
ECV chief executive Behyad Jafari has previously said establishing a comprehensive network of fast-charging stations will be critical to the uptake of EVs in Australia.
The Victorian Government announcement comes just days after New South Wales announced a $3,000 upfront discount and 100% stamp duty discount on new EVs bought in the state, which is set to boost the uptake of EVs significantly.
The NSW incentive is part of a $500 million plan to have battery-powered vehicles account for half of all new car sales in the state by 2031 and includes $131 million to establish an ultra-fast charging network within reach of all major highways  across the state.

Meanwhile, utilities giant Origin Energy has called on state and federal governments to incentivise the installation of smart chargers in the homes of EV drivers in order to ensure the grid can support the expected growth in EV ownership.
The call comes after Origin revealed the initial data from a trial designed to analyse how EVs would impact the power grid when they’re eventually adopted more widely across Australia.
The trial, which will conclude in December 2022, has seen the installation of smart chargers for 70 residential EV owners and 33 businesses and obtained their baseline charging data.
Smart chargers co-ordinate recharging times with periods of surplus solar PV, such the middle of the day, and avoid adding strain to peak demand periods on the grid from 5-6pm onwards.
Prior to the trial more than 60% of the participants were plugging their vehicles directly into the standard garage socket when they got home of an evening and Origin’s head of e-mobility, Chau Le, told the Sydney Morning Herald this could cause grid security issues as EV uptake continues to rise.
“Without incentives and regulatory policies that encourage smart charging, that’s what’s going to happen when mass-market adoption takes off; you’re going to have all these EVs that are being charged that cannot be enrolled onto smart-charging programs or cannot be managed,” Le said.
“We do expect … that will cause constraints on the network and the wholesale market, if it’s not managed properly.”
Origin expects EV ownership to rise sharply in Australia and predicted it could account for an additional 22 TWh of load on the electricity grid by 2040.

Spanish renewable energy company Acciona has connected to the grid the first storage station developed with recycled batteries at its 1.2 MW photovoltaic park in Tudela, in Spain’s Navarra region, as part of a joint project developed with the startup BeePlanet under the umbrella of Acciona’s open innovation program, I’mnovation.
Acciona has installed four second-life batteries from car manufacturer Nissan with a combined capacity of 130 kWh at its solar park. The battery station will be operated by the company’s Renewable Energy Control Centre with its global GEMS energy management platform and renewable energy will be certified throughout the process through Acciona’s Greenchain platform, based on blockchain. The company will also conduct a comparative analysis to verify whether recycled batteries can offer the same benefits as first-use batteries.
Acciona’s director of energy innovation, Belén Linares, explained that second-life batteries can be “an ideal option to complement self-consumption facilities, electric vehicle recharging networks, and micro-grids.”
According to BeePlanet, the batteries used in the project have more than 80% of their original capacity operational and a maximum of 5% is discharged in 24 hours, to ensure the maximum performance.
The Spanish start-up announced in May the launch of a new storage system of up to 1 MWh with second-life batteries, which it called Power ESS. The system can be used in the commercial and industrial, primary and construction sectors and can be integrated with photovoltaic and wind plants.
It is a flexible and modular system. Starting from a 42 kWh rack, it can be expanded by modules connected in parallel up to 1 MWh. “In this way, once we have dimensioned the project, we install the necessary racks, knowing that if capacity needs to be expanded in the future, it will be very simple,” the company explained.
The system can be installed indoors and outdoors. Turnkey Power ESS containerised solutions are installed outdoors. The equipment is made up of replaceable units. “In this way, we are able to increase the life cycle of the installation. When we detect, through remote maintenance, that there is a … unit that has reached its capacity limit, we take care of replacing and recycling it,” it went on to say.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/24/fimer-launches-two-new-inverters-for-large-scale-projects/,"INVERTERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY,WORLD",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"JUNE 24, 2021",Fimer launches two new inverters for large scale projects,"From pv magazine Global
Italian inverter maker Fimer unveiled today two new products for the large scale segment – a high-power, multi-MPPT string inverter and modular conversion solution designed to supply both decentralised and centralised systems.
The new PVS-350, with a power of 350 kVA and an efficiency of over 99% is, according to the company, the most powerful string multi-MPPT inverter (350 kVA) with the highest power density in the solar industry. The device can perform string diagnostics through the online analysis of I-V curves.
According to Fimer, the inverter’s capacity and the power-to-weight ratio enable savings of up to 30% in transportation and installation costs, and up to 15% more AC capacity for medium-voltage stations compared to other decentralised conversion solutions available today. This means fewer stations per megawatt (AC) of installed power, with a cumulative saving that can exceed €0.02/W in a 100 MW system.
The input characteristics of the multi-MPPT inverter have been optimised to take full advantage of the benefits of high-power crystalline modules with 182mm and 210mm cells, allowing for additional cost savings at the level of the system ranging from €0.05 to €0.09/W compared to systems designed with conventional modules based on 166x166mm cells.
For centralised system configurations, which currently represent almost 40% of the market, Fimer launched the PVS-260/PVS-300, a completely modular solution designed with a single MPPT configuration.
The company said this solution can easily replace central inverters in more traditional designs, significantly improving performance and reducing BoP costs – optimising LCOE – achieving a 2.3% reduction in LCOE with a modular conversion configuration, compared to a central solution. It also has higher system availability, over 99.9%, compared to a 99.5% maximum for central solutions; and record power density and power capacity, two times more than any inverter of this kind available on the market, which means fewer drives to install the same MVA capacity.
The manufacturer also explained that the PVS-260/PVS-300 has a large capacity combined with a unique MPPT power pack of super-compact design, which allows developers to maintain a “centralised” system configuration if they prefer. All power electronics are also concentrated close to the other critical AC power elements to simplify control and routine maintenance.
The device is claimed to have lower operating and maintenance costs, which the manufacturer estimates at €0.013/W less than the central solutions for 25 years, thanks to the granularity of the energy conversion achieved with smaller, interchangeable power blocks. Moreover, the combination of six to 24 inverter modules in two units is said to increase the capacity of the 40-foot, medium-voltage compact skid, available in different versions with power between 1,560 kVA and 7,200 kVA.
“By combining the power modules in a factory-tested and pre-assembled medium-voltage station, the new platform can compete with the multi-megawatt utility scale station designs of the latest central inverters, allowing designers to apply the modular configuration to systems of any size,” explained the manufacturer.
“While the shift from central inverters to string inverter technologies in the utility scale sector has increased in the last five years, Fimer recognises that centralised configurations still prevail.” For this reason, the company added “it has developed the inverters PVS-350 and the PVS-260/PVS-300 modular conversion platforms, to serve both decentralised and centralised applications.”
