The university has partnered with analytics platform Teslascope for what it said would be a world-first international trial to investigate if the spare battery capacity in EVs could be used to enhance grid resilience and energy reliability and security.
While the penetration of EVs in Australia lags behind many developed nations, the Federal Government has forecast that 30% of new car sales in 2030 will be electric, compared to about 1% at present.
E-mobility research fellow at UQ, Jake Whitehead said with growing numbers of EVs on the roads, attention is rapidly turning to how we can make the most of these “batteries on wheels”.
“We have a unique opportunity through this project to better understand EV driving and charging behaviour in different markets, and what are the opportunities to use EVs to provide energy services and generate extra income for owners in the future,” he said.
Whitehead said while most of today’s EVs have a driving range of more than 400 kilometres, most are only driven about 50 kilometres a day, providing opportunities to store energy and export power to the grid using V2G technology.
V2G technology allows power to flow from the grid to the vehicle and vice-versa, potentially allowing car owners to sell energy to the network, while utilities could use EVs as a backstop during peak demand periods.
“This provides a unique opportunity to leverage this spare energy capacity to absorb renewable energy generated in the middle of the day and overnight, and potentially even export energy to power homes and support the grid in the future using vehicle-to-grid chargers,” Whitehead said.
“(The study) will not only help to inform EV policy internationally, but importantly assess the feasibility of using EVs as batteries on wheels.”

To date, V2G technologies and services have been largely non-existent in the Australian market, though the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) last year provided funding for a trial for EVs provide frequency regulation services to the National Electricity Market (NEM) in the Australian Capital Territory.
Whitehead said the UQ study would use Teslascope’s platform to collect vehicle usage data without any hardware, but by directly pulling data – with owner’s permission – through the vehicle’s API (application programming interface).
“We will be able to leverage these learnings to influence government policy, including the rollout of public charging infrastructure,” he said.
“We also aim to use the findings of this research to address some of the common misconceptions about how EV owners use their vehicles, and highlight how this technology provides far greater benefits, than risks, to the energy sector.”
The university aims to initially recruit 500 Tesla owners, with those in Australia, the United States, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Germany and Britain able to apply for the first phase of the study.
As more EV manufacturers integrate API access into their vehicles, the intention is to expand the program to include other vehicle brands.
The study is being jointly funded by iMove Cooperative Research and Advance Queensland Industry Research Fellowship.
iMOVE managing director Ian Christensen said while there’s a focus on the switch to EVs to meet emissions reductions targets, experts are now also pondering how they can provide other energy services.

“Electrification of transport has been identified as one of the major pathways for reducing emissions – and by leveraging EV battery spare capacity and using smart charging technology, excess solar could be absorbed by vehicles parked during the day, and potentially discharged to support the grid during the evening using V2G infrastructure,” he said.
“For smart charging infrastructure to deliver these benefits, EV uptake must be significant increased and, importantly, EV owners must be willing to use their vehicles as batteries on wheels.”
The study comes after Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week launched the Future Fuels and Vehicles Strategy, with $178 million in new funding for EV charging stations and infrastructure.
A day later the New South Wales (NSW) government announced $105 million to cover the cost difference for EVs bought by councils, taxi companies and other fleet operators.
The money comes on top of $490m the NSW government has already committed to drive uptake of EVs, which includes initiatives such as offering $3,000 rebates for the first 25,000 EVs sold in the state and exemptions on stamp duty.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/18/nsw-first-as-western-sydney-green-hydrogen-plant-starts-up/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 18, 2021",NSW first as Western Sydney green hydrogen plant starts up,"Gas utility Jemena said 23,500 residential customers and more than 100 commercial and industrial customers in New South Wales (NSW) will now receive green hydrogen as part of their gas mix following the start of production at the Western Sydney Green Hydrogen Hub.
The Green Hydrogen Hub, which was partly funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), comprises a 500 kW electrolyser that uses solar PV and wind power to produce green hydrogen.
The facility connects to Jemena’s existing gas distribution network which delivers gas to more than 1.4 million residential and business customers in NSW.
Jemena managing director Frank Tudor said green hydrogen from the project is being blended into and stored in its existing gas distribution network, replacing a small part of the gas mix.
“This is the first step to decarbonise the Jemena gas network,” he said.
“By blending it into our gas distribution network we are driving the transition to a low-carbon future by providing cleaner energy solutions to our NSW customers.”
The project will also supply green hydrogen for use as a transport fuel from early 2022 through an agreement with gas supply company Coregas.
Tudor said the ‘living laboratory’ was intended to demonstrate how the systems and technology required to generate green hydrogen and store it in the existing gas network could work at scale.
Jemena plans to increase the amount of renewably generated gases blended into the network over time as more renewable gases become available.
“This will ensure our gas network plays its role in enabling the NSW and Australian governments to achieve net zero by 2050,” he said.
ARENA, which awarded $7.5 million in funding to the project, said it is one of the first “power to gas” trials to inject hydrogen into the gas distribution network in Australia and will focus on addressing the technical, regulatory, environmental and economic barriers to the production and use of hydrogen in gas distribution and transmission networks.

While this marks a first for NSW, green hydrogen is already being blended into the South Australian gas network.
Australian Gas Infrastructure Group’s $14.5 million Hydrogen Park South Australia (HyP SA) production facility near Adelaide came online in May, injecting green hydrogen into the existing gas distribution grid for the first time in Australia.
HyP SA, located at Tonsley south of Adelaide, is now delivering a blend of approximately 5% renewable hydrogen and natural gas to 700 homes in the Adelaide suburb of Mitchell Park.
HyP SA features a 1.25 MW Siemens proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser. AGN, which is part of Australian Gas Infrastructure Group (AGIG), said it is the largest electrolyser in Australia and is capable of producing up to 480kg of hydrogen per day or approximately 175 tonnes of hydrogen per annum.

The MOEJ said it will subsidize a part of the demonstration project which will manufacture hydrogen produced with renewable energy in South Australia, where large-scale solar and wind power generation are abundant, and transport and utilize it in partner countries such as Pacific Island countries.
“Through this project, Japan aims to reduce greenhouse gas by utilizing advanced decarbonization technologies and to contribute organization of global green hydrogen network in Indo-Pacific region,” the MOEJ said in a statement.
Japan’s Environment Minister Tsuyoshi Yamaguchi said the project “is a great start to our bilateral cooperation between Japan and Australia to expand the green hydrogen market and build an international supply chain in the Indo Pacific area, including the island countries in the Pacific”.
Marubeni is currently working with the South Australian government on the development of the project, including site selection.
SA Energy Minister Dan Van Holst Pellekaan said Marubeni had chosen South Australia as its preferred location due to the state’s high-quality natural resources and developed infrastructure.
“For a number of years, we’ve been building relationships with key governments and companies who are interested in hydrogen produced by renewable energy,” he said.
“It’s wonderful to see these partnerships solidifying into investments.”
The Minister said South Australia has an abundance of wind and sun already being converted to renewable energy with the state aiming to be net-100% renewables by 2030, and 500% of current grid demand in renewable energy by 2050.
“It is an exciting opportunity for South Australia to showcase to the world that we are ideally located for low-cost, clean hydrogen production to help others to reach their carbon emissions reduction targets,” he said.

The announcement marks another step forward in Marubeni’s plans to establish an export pipeline of large-scale production of renewable hydrogen and ammonia in Australia.
Marubeni earlier this year signed a heads of agreement with Australian-based oil and gas producer Woodside and fellow Japanese company IHI Corporation to investigate the production and export of green hydrogen produced from renewable hydro power in Tasmania.
Woodside announced last week it has secured land for the proposed H2TAS hydrogen plant after initial feasibility studies concluded that it is technically and commercially feasible to export ammonia to Japan from the Bell Bay area.
The proposed H2TAS project would be a phased development with the potential to support up to 1.7 GW of electrolysis for hydrogen and ammonia production. The initial phase would have capacity of up to 300 MW and target production of 200,000 tonnes per annum of ammonia.
Marubeni is also part of a consortium which is investigating the commercial viability of developing a 3 GW electrolysis plant at Gladstone in Queensland with the view to producing green hydrogen for export to Japan and use in local industry.
Marubeni and state government-owned electricity generator Stanwell are part of a broader consortium of Australian and Japanese energy companies which have commenced a $10.4 million feasibility study for a proposed large-scale production and export project.
The project aims to produce up to 36,500 tonnes per annum of renewable hydrogen, commencing production in the mid-2020s and scaling up to 328,500 tonnes per annum in 2031 to meet forecast demand.

Researchers from the Chongqing University in China and Chinese investments firm Shaanxi Investment Group Co., Ltd have proposed to use abandoned coal mine goaves as upper and underground water reservoirs for pumped hydro storage (PHS) facilities in combination with large-scale solar and wind facilities.
“During extraction of mineral resources from underground deposits, shafts and extensive galleries are excavated,” the academics explained. “These underground voids are usually left to be flooded, but often perpetual costs related to pumping to keep a safe water level or water treatment have to be maintained, becoming long-term liabilities.”
Currently, according to their analysis, there are 3,868 closed coal mines in China that could eventually be considered for this repurposing concept. In order to assess if these sites are suitable for pumped-hydro storage, three main aspects should be considered: storable volume; usable volume; and fluid exchange. Once these values are determined, the performance of a goaf pumped-hydro storage facility should also be evaluated by considering meteorological data such as solar radiation and wind speed.
A pumped-hydro facility built on these sites should consist of an upper reservoir or a surface reservoir and a lower reservoir located at the underground mine goaves. The ideal altitude difference between the upper and lower reservoir is indicated at around 100m.
The system would rely on conventional components such as reversible hydraulic pumps, turbines, and penstocks, and it would be operated in combination with conventional utility-scale wind and solar power plants. “When the electricity generated by wind and solar power cannot satisfy the demand, the stored water will be released to produce electricity and fill the demand gap,” the Chinese group explained. “The penstocks, surge tank, and a variety of connecting tunnels/rooms provide ancillary services for the system’s smooth operation.”
The scientists emphasised that the storage capacity of a similar scheme would depend not only on the goaf volume but also on the interspace between the fractured rock blocks that pile up within the goaf itself after mining activities are abandoned. “During charging and discharging, water and air would exchange, and the permeability within the goaf determines whether the water or air can flow in and out smoothly or not,” they said, noting that the flow velocity of water and air within the reservoir is determined by pressure gradient and permeability.
“To ensure sufficient outputs of turbine and pumps, the maximum water flow should be guaranteed,” they added. “As the permeability decreases, the saturation line tends to decline during injection and rise during releasing, implying a less water volume injected during filling and released during draining the reservoir, and hence a smaller usable capacity of the goaf reservoirs.” The system design also includes the construction of ventilation shafts at 2 m above the maximum water level in the reservoir for air smooth exchange during water pumping and injecting.
A simulation conducted with this model showed a pumped-hydro facility built in a depleted coal mine may ensure an average system efficiency of 82.8% during a year. The regulated energy per volume (REPV) is estimated at 2.82 kW·h/m3.
The researchers concluded that using abandoned coal mine goaves for pumped hydro facilities is technically feasible; however, they warned that locations with low pH value should be avoided, as acid goaf water could corrode the plant components, and release metal ions, or heavy metals, thus damaging the underground structures and polluting the surrounding water bodies. “Necessary purification treatments are very important to the water safety,” they said.
The system design is described in the study Underground Hydro-Pumped Energy Storage Using Coal Mine Goafs: System Performance Analysis and a Case Study for China, which was recently published in Frontiers in Earth Science.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/18/scalable-turnkey-solar-carport-solution-for-commercial-applications/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 18, 2021",Scalable turnkey solar carport solution for commercial applications,"From pv magazine Global
Japan-based electricity retailing company Sinanen Co., Ltd. has unveiled a scalable solar carport solution for commercial applications.
The turnkey system can be used as a single installation hosting a minimum of four vehicles, but if deployed in series it may be utilised to give shelter to hundreds of vehicles, the manufacturer said.
The basic system is offered with a minimum capacity of 10.80 kW provided by 30 solar modules from Chinese manufacturer DMEGC with a power output of 360/365W each. The company also offers a more performant solution with modules with a power range of 400 to 420 W from German module maker Luxor Solar.
The carport may rely on two different inverters provided by Chinese manufacturer Huawei, depending on the system size: a 97.6% device with 4 MTTP trackers and a nominal power of 20 kW; and a 98.9%-efficient inverter with 6 MTTP trackers and power of 50 kW.
The carport length can range from 10.5 m, for a structure able to host four vehicles, to 26.2 m, which would be enough to host ten vehicles. Width and eight are 5.2 and 3.0 m, respectively.
The carport will be sold in Japan starting from December. The company said it expects to generate revenue of ¥2 billion (AU$24 million) with this new solution by 2025. Sinanen is also offering a residential solar carport solution since 2012 and it says it has installed more than 1,000 turnkey system to date.
