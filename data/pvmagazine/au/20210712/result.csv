A company spokesperson told pv magazine on Monday the project is part of Risen Energy’s strategy to expand its Australian portfolio with small-scale utility solar, particularly those projects around the 5 MW mark, able to avoid much of the electricity network’s congestion woes.
“Small-scale utility projects are one of the business portfolios we are focusing on and our strategy in Australia is to develop utility-scale renewable energy projects in both large-scale and small-scale,” the spokesperson said.
“Small-scale utility projects often require less land, less construction time, less capital investment and are simpler during the approval process but nonetheless bring valuable job opportunities to local communities.”
The proposed North Wagga Wagga solar farm will be built on a 17-hectare site within a larger 34ha property approximately 3.5 kilometres from the Wagga Wagga town centre. The facility will have a capacity of up to 5 MW, subject to final grid connection and design.
Work on the project is scheduled to commence midway through 2022 with construction expected to take about 12 months.
Risen, which owns the 103 MW Yarranlea Solar Farm in Queensland and the 100 MW Merredin Solar Farm in Western Australia, said the North Wagga Wagga project is separate to a deal it recently struck with South Australia-based developer Green Gold Energy (GGE) to jointly develop and construct a string of solar projects in Australia.
That project will see the two entities develop 16 solar PV projects of approximately 4.95 MW each within the next 24 months. The total project capacity will be 80 MW with most of the facilities to be developed in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.
Risen said six of the projects have already reached settlement phase but the Wagga Wagga solar farm is not among them.
“The proposed North Wagga Wagga Solar Farm is one of Risen’s self-developed projects which started from scratch,” the Risen spokesperson said, adding the company is seeking to add more assets to its portfolio.
“Risen is working to develop 5 MW projects and large-scale projects across Australia. Further announcements will be made in due course.”
Risen, which only last month announced it would construct a $13.35 billion mega production facility in Malaysia to supports its ambitions in the region, said the projects were an important part of the company’s strategy in Australia, with plans to invest in renewable energy projects with an accumulated capacity in excess of 2 GW.
“We are steadily growing our solar projects and solar module supply businesses in Australia, and we see a bright future ahead as Australia continues to expand its renewable energy market,” Risen Australia vice general manager John Zhong said.
“Risen Energy has a long-term plan to be a major independent renewable power producer within Australia.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/12/are-the-nationals-now-the-party-for-mining-not-farming/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JULY 12, 2021","Are the Nationals now the party for mining, not farming?","Joyce and some of his Queensland colleagues unashamedly support the coal industry, and the federal party appears broadly opposed to Australia adopting a target of net-zero emissions by 2050.
These are positions at odds with progressive quarters of the party, particularly in Victoria. The divisions came to a head earlier this month when, in response to Joyce’s ascension, Victorian Nationals leader Peter Walsh and deputy Steph Ryan sought to split the state party from its federal counterpart.
The move was unsuccessful. But Walsh later called for the party to have “a constructive discussion about the transition of our energy supplies and how we reduce our impact on the Earth we live on”.
So are the federal Nationals the latter-day party for mining, not farming? If so, what does this mean for the party’s political positioning and prospects? To address this question, we must examine the Nationals’ evolution over the past century.
The National Party began federally in 1920 as the Australian Country Party, and traditionally represented farmers and rural communities. But over time, the party evolved to represent and advocate for the broader interests of regional Australia.
Economic nationalism has underpinned the party, especially since the 1950s. Under this ethos, farming, mining and basic manufacturing were considered key foundations for nation-building – a view which persists today. As the Nationals’ Senator Matt Canavan wrote in an opinion piece last month: “The restoration of Barnaby Joyce as deputy prime minister restores a strong advocate for the economically nationalist, Australia-first approach that has always served us well”.
Most Nationals candidates come from rural small businesses, finance organisations and social and community services – though many have farming roots or some involvement in farming activities.
Rural communities are under pressure from dwindling populations and limited employment opportunities. In that sense, the mining industry is an important source of jobs and economic activity in Australia’s regions.
The federal party’s vociferous support for mining and opposition to emissions reduction is, in part, values signalling. For many in the Nationals, coal helped build the nation, while climate change action and renewable energy represent a moral and material threat.
Regional differences also exist. Nationals’ support for mining is particularly strong in Queensland – traditionally a mining-dependent state where resource investment has long been considered a means of rural development. At both the Queensland and federal levels, strong political connections exist between mining companies and the Liberal-National Party.
In another sign of the federal party’s contemporary priorities, Joyce’s close party ally Matt Canavan recently told the Guardian: “About 5% of our voters are farmers. It’s about 2% of the overall population. So 95% of our voters don’t farm, aren’t farmers or don’t own farmland”.
The Nationals’ apparent support for mining above farming exists partly because because they can get away with it. In many regions, farming and mining co-exist in reasonable harmony, both sectors enjoying the benefits of strong regional centres.
In some cases conflict does arise, such as with gas exploration in cropping country. But in those regions, disenfranchised Nationals voters typically direct their votes to micro-parties rather than Labor or the Greens. These votes often flow back to the Nationals via preferences.
The federal Nationals’ pro-mining, anti-renewables stance may not, however, benefit the party over the long term.
First, mining is at best a very patchy contributor to rural development. Overall, net employment in agriculture is still higher than for mining and is more evenly distributed across the regions. Mining investment can ebb and flow quickly with commodity prices and the stage of project development, leaving communities with falling real estate values and an altered social fabric.
The anti-emissions control stance could also trigger conflict with major farm organisations. Many, such as the National Farmers Federation and Meat and Livestock Association, want to see a strong national emissions reduction plan, under which landowners can benefit financially by participating in land carbon schemes.
Many farmers are also interested in renewable energy as both a source of income and cheaper power. Renewables projects are proliferating in regional areas and even Joyce has been known to turn up in a hard hat to get behind them. So we can look forward to some interesting management of that cognitive dissonance.
Following Joyce’s return to the federal party leadership, Victorian Nationals leader Peter Walsh said he’s had “a very frank discussion with him about the policy differences on climate change”.
But discontent on climate policy is not confined to Victoria. Across the party, Young Nationals organisations are generally far more open to climate action than their older party colleagues.
And the hardline mining stance will not help the Nationals regain or even retain seats in areas such as Ballina in NSW, where demographic changes have eroded the party’s support.
But the biggest test of the Nationals’ farming-vs-mining rift is perhaps yet to come. The European Union and other jurisdictions are considering imposing tariffs on goods – including agricultural products – from nations such as Australia which lack strong emissions reduction policies.
While helping drive global climate action, such moves would partly be motivated by economic nationalism – boosting the international competitiveness of industries in the country/s applying the tariff. The sight of the Nationals impotently arguing for free trade in this instance will be fascinating political theatre.

The new rule, which comes into effect on July 22, replaces the current arrangements for large DCAs with a framework for Distributed Network Assets (DNAs) that treats material additions to the transmission system – usually transmission lines with a total route length of 30km or longer – as part of the transmission network, rather than as connection assets.
This allows for each connecting party to be treated individually in terms of meeting technical standards and settlement in the dispatch system and facilitates more efficient use of connection assets.
The existing arrangements allow connection assets to be shared but require all users to connect at the same point.
“This single connection point has created obstacles when multiple generators have sought to share assets, because they had to agree on one set of technical performance standards, a joint bidding strategy, share one transmission loss factor, and more,” the AEMC said.
“This effectively prevented multiple parties from sharing and led to under-usage of the existing infrastructure and a disincentive to invest in new infrastructure.
“With the new rule, these assets will be treated as part of the network, allowing the creation of multiple connection points so multiple generators can connect using their individual settings.”
Grid connection is rated by investors one of the most significant challenges facing large-scale renewable energy projects but the AMEC is confident the rule change will promote large-scale investment in renewables.
The AEMC described the rule change as a “win-win”, saying investors could recoup costs while the shared access would make connection costs lower for generators than under the existing rules.
“It is expected investment in transmission infrastructure will become more attractive to developers and investors as the new rule enables sharing of transmission assets as well as connection costs,” the commission said.
The AEMC expects the new arrangements will also enhance grid security and reliability, creating a single point of accountability and ensuring all material additions to the network are visible to the primary transmission network service provider for planning and operation purposes.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/12/chinas-solar-pv-demand-could-effortlessly-surpass-100-gw-in-2022-as-production-overcapacity-predicted/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",BECKY BEETZ,"JULY 12, 2021",China’s solar PV demand could ‘effortlessly’ surpass 100 GW in 2022 as production overcapacity predicted,"From pv magazine Global
In a note issued today, the Asia Europe Clean Energy (Solar) Advisory Co. Ltd (AECEA) says China’s PV industry may be on track for a bumper solar year in 2022, following a potentially “flat” year in 2021.
The “substantial” price increases for various raw materials that have been witnessed since the start of this year have seen PV projects either delayed or cancelled, writes director Frank Haugwitz. Consequently, just 9.91 GW of new solar capacity was deployed by the end of this May, comprising 5.76 GW of utility-scale projects and 4.15 GW of residential PV systems, the latter of which is said to represent a more than three-fold increase on the previous year.
“Due to the current high price ecosystem, which is anticipated to only marginally soften in the coming months… a larger share of projects originally scheduled to get connected to the grid by December, could actually be shifted into 2022,” he says.
In addition to the price increases, the country’s National Energy Administration (NEA) recently announced in its 2021/2022 wind and solar PV policy that projects approved in 2019/2020 but which are not connected by the end of this year will be automatically included in next year’s quota – 90 GW for solar – and will not be subject to a new competitive bidding process. Previously, it was understood that these project approvals would be revoked.
While there is still no official confirmation, recent provincial governmental announcements including in Hebei, Shaanxi, and Gansu Province, state that the deadline for forthcoming and already approved projects is December 2022, according to AECEA.
“If having effectively granted another year, China’s demand in 2021 could in the best case be just flat YoY, whereas in AECEA’s view demand could effortlessly surpass the 100 GW mark in 2022,” says Haugwitz.
According to AECEA, China’s over 260 PV module manufacturers exported 35.4 GW of product between this January and May, representing a 34% year-on-year increase.
Overall, global PV module capacities in 2020 reached around 320 GW. This represents an annual increase of almost 47%, of which China comprised 245 GW, having added over 90 GW of new capacity, and which is more than double last year’s global PV installations of 120 GW, says AECEA. In terms of actual output, these figures translate to 164 GW globally, and nearly 135 GW in China.
Looking to PV wafer production, the analyst says that of the around 248 GW of global capacity in 2020, 240 GW were in China. These manufacturers were said to have produced almost 162 GW last year, out of a global total of 168 GW.
The polysilicon situation is slightly different in that between 2018 and first half of 2020 hardly any new investments in polysilicon were made, which resulted in a “fairly tight” supply situation and price increases of up to 160%. This has led to both established and new manufacturers announcing plans to add new polysilicon capacity; thus China’s 2020 China’s polysilicon production capacity of around 420,000 tonnes is expected to reach an annual output of up to 1.6 to 1.8 million tonnes “in the foreseeable future.”
“Looking ahead, taking wafer production as an example, an estimated 110-130 GW shall be added in 2021, and possibly another 170-190 GW next year, thus amounting to up to 560 GW, dwarfing by then the estimated 450 GW cell production capacities by almost 25%,” continues Haugwitz.
“In comparison, by the end of 2021 China’s module production may reach 390 GW; that means module production capacities may increase by a staggering 60% YoY. However, this in stark contrast to a projected global demand estimated to be btw. 160 to 240 GW this and next year.”
As such, AECEA predicts that “another industry-cycle featuring massive over-capacities” is on the horizon.
Another reason for increased production capacities is due to the fact local governments are starting to see the renewable energy industry as an area of future growth, says the analyst, on the back of China’s 2030 and 2060 climate change targets and because “substantial” rule-making authority was granted to them by the central government in the first quarter this year.
Haugwitz writes: “An increasing number of provincial jurisdictions have endorsed local development policies requiring PV power plant developers seeking official project approval to substantially investment into local manufacturing, calling it ‘local economical contribution’. The latter is not necessarily limited to manufacturing, although preferred, the construction of buildings or schools would equally be accepted, provided it meets the respective economic targets.
“Consequently, such a practice, which at present is rather the norm than the exception, drives up costs for ground-mounted utility-scale projects considerably. It therefore, does not surprise that just 5.76 GW of utility-scale were deployed during the first 5 months this year, whereas 4.15 GW of residential PV systems, representing a more than three-fold increase YoY.”
China’s distributed solar PV market is on track for significant growth, says Haugwitz, not least because the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has identified distributed solar PV combined with electrical energy storage as its second most important project under the Circular Economy Development Plan for the 2021-2025 period.
In late June, the NEA also announced a pilot program designed to ramp up the deployment of distributed solar PV under which it requested provincial offices to nominate counties where a trial program to push blanket rooftop solar could be carried out by July 15.
The goal is to have at least 20% of all residential rooftops equipped with solar, as well as at least 30% of commercial and industrial structures; 40% of non-government public buildings, such as hospital and schools; and half of the roofs on the government estate.
This push has led the Energy Research Institute, which is affiliated with China’s NDRC, to estimate a national rooftop potential of up to 800 GW, including around 200 GW in Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu; and 55 GW in the Guangdong Province. Overall, industry representatives are said to believe that the pilot program could see up to 250 GW of future demand.
According to AECEA, 23 provinces and municipalities have already announced their plans to participate in the trial. “In AECEA’s opinion, till the end of this year, we may see a doubling of up to 10 GW vs 2020. However, anticipating the pilot program will be successful and thus converted into a full-blown multiple-year program, this could trigger an annual demand of 20+ GW from 2022 onwards,” says Haugwitz.
This year, it predicts that demand for residential PV may reach 16 GW, up from 10.12 GW in 2020, due to the RMB 500 million worth of subsidies issued. Even without subsidies, the analysts expect this demand to remain going forward, because of China’s “rural revitalisation strategy”.
“Overall, in the mid-term distributed solar PV is expected to make up an ever larger share of the overall market,” concludes Haugwitz.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/12/when-does-revamping-pay-off/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,QUALITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE,GERMANY,INDIA,SPAIN",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"JULY 12, 2021",When does revamping pay off?,"From pv magazine Spain
In some PV markets, projects are getting older and certain owners and operators are beginning to rethink their asset management strategy. The choice is clear: maintain the asset on the basis of preventive and corrective maintenance, determined by the original electromechanical condition; or invest in new equipment to extend the life of the asset, assuming the challenges that entails. In this, three-part article, Asier Ukar, senior consultant at PI Berlin and general manager of the German engineering company’s Spanish subsidiary, will address several issues that will allow us to understand the benefits of revamping without losing sight of the challenges and risks involved in carrying it out on a photovoltaic asset.
This first instalment of the interview investigates the scenarios that justify revamping, or plant modernisation strategy. The first question that naturally comes to mind is, in which scenarios does revamping make sense? PI Berlin identifies four: when there is a big technological leap between the grid connection date and the revamping date; when plant performance is compromised due to poor execution practices and there is an electricity tariff or feed-in-tariff (FIT) in force; when the natural ageing of the plant requires it; and when an IPP (independent power producer) wants to homogenise its portfolio, made up of assets built in different periods and made up of technologies of different natures. Let’s analyse them one by one.
This could mean a scenario in which there has been a big technological leap between the original date of connection and the date of revamping. Take Spain or Italy as an example. These markets experienced big expansions between 2006 and 2008 and between 2009 and 2011. At that time, it was common to build PV plants using solutions that are practically extinct today, such as dual-axis trackers, 60-cell crystalline PV modules (measuring 1,650x990mm), galvanically separated inverters, thin film amorphous silicon, or CIGS module technology.
In addition to purely technical factors, there are also economic factors that have influenced the development and implementation of PV installations. For example, the Spanish regulatory framework that led to the division of PV plants into 100 kW islands with individual transformers and meters, or the strong demand for modules caused by Italy and Spain that forced many installers to purchase, for a single plant of a few megawatts’ capacity, modules from various manufacturers and technologies in order to meet the required volume. The technical characteristics of the PV components available between 2006 and 2011, as well as economic and regulatory factors, were characteristic of the nature of the first PV plants. Progress on technology and policies means these strategies have now practically disappeared.
Since FITs typically guarantee a price per kilowatt-hour generated within predefined limits and under-performance can quickly become a serious problem for project economics.
Under-performance can be due to many factors, including poor installation practice, product failure, or a combination of the two. Ukar lists several examples to illustrate these aspects, such as (i) flimsy design of dual-axis trackers; (ii) trackers based on prisms rather than astronomical tracking, adding complexity and wear on moving elements; (iii) use of three-pole AC cables for DC applications; (iv) reduced cable capacity due to excessive accumulation of cables in trenches or troughs; (v) mistreatment of modules on-site, with consequent damage to cells or glass and back foil; (vi) very permissive engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts that barely contain requirements for quality control during construction and commissioning; (vii) the absence of a SCADA system that would allow adequate monitoring of plant operation and failures; (viii) a lack of knowledge of degradation phenomena such as PID; and (ix) lack of quality control during PV module manufacturing. “In some plants installed in Spain or Italy before 2011, it is not uncommon to find disoriented or stopped trackers, incorrectly labeled modules, detached diode boxes, inverters with poor grid synchronisation, or plants where the performance ratio is not monitored at all,” Ukar said.
Failures can be partly justified by the rush some installers and developers had to deal with due to tight construction schedules and short supply of modules, and also from a lack of experience in the sector. In any case, there are, today, a large number of PV plants operating well below their theoretical yields, leading not only to wastage of the tariff, as mentioned above but also, in the specific case of Spain, the risk of the loss of the tariff entirely for not reaching the minimum threshold of operating hours.
Here we consider ‘natural’ ageing of the plant by itself as an argument to justify revamping, regardless of under-performance or construction defects.
This will focus mainly on modules and inverters, since these components have been most thoroughly studied in relation to their lifetime. The 10 to 12-year threshold is commonly considered the point at which replacement of the most sensitive inverter components (mainly IGBTs, capacitors and filters) will be required. In the case of string inverters, this means almost a complete replacement of the inverter, while in the case of central inverters it would mean the replacement of these parts while maintaining more durable components, such as busbars, racks or certain protections. High temperatures and high DC/AC ratios undoubtedly shorten inverter lifetimes. Therefore, greater longevity is expected in central European climates compared to tropical climates, where humidity should also be added as a degrading factor.
As for PV modules, different degradation trends are observed depending on the technology used and location. These differences can be seen in established markets such as Germany, Italy or Spain, which have a large number of PV plants that have entered the last third of their useful life. It should be noted the environmental factors that first trigger degradation effects are high temperatures and high exposure to UV radiation, or a combination of both. This phenomenon is clearly observed in modules installed on dual-axis trackers, which are widely present in both Italy and Spain.
In these cases, modules are subjected to high temperatures and high radiation for long periods due to the theoretical perpendicularity that the tracker seeks with respect to the incident radiation. This is why phenomena such as yellowing, corrosion of busbars, chalking or degradation of cables and connectors are frequent in these plants, and somewhat less frequently observed in countries such as Germany, where the use of two-axis trackers is restricted mainly to the south, and where environmental conditions are benevolent for PV components.
Adding India as a fourth market with around ten years of accumulated lifetime in a significant number of plants, we observe that the levels of decay described above emerge in a significantly shorter time, as a result of the confluence of environmental stress factors such as high humidity, high temperatures, salinity or high UV radiation. In states including Rajasthan, Gujarat or Tamil Nadu, it is not uncommon to find signs of accelerated aging in modules, electrical panels or inverters with associated insulation problems, overheating due to dust accumulation, corrosion in wiring, or cracking of the backsheet.
It should not be forgotten that product warranties provided by module manufacturers in the early days of PV rarely exceeded five years, and that the only certifications required in more than 90% of cases were restricted to IEC 61215 and IEC 61730 – both necessary but clearly insufficient to predict the performance of a module beyond the first few years of its life. As in the second scenario described above, a low performance ratio – for whatever reason – is a waste of the tariff and therefore a loss of return.
The rate of ageing for modules and other components depends on the number of environmental stress factors that converge simultaneously. The incidence of these factors is different in Southern Italy than in Germany, as well as in the case of fixed-tilt or dual-axis tracking. Most of the defects associated with such ageing are not covered by the expired product warranty, which is particularly relevant in the case of modules installed more than a decade ago whose product warranty was generally limited to five years, as opposed to today’s 12 years or more.
In this scenario, revamping is considered by an independent power producer looking to homogenise a portfolio that is made up of assets acquired at different times, and therefore made of different technologies. We are talking about portfolios of multiple plants, most of them less than 3 MW, and installed with varying technologies such as low-power crystalline modules; thin-film modules which are now practically extinct, such as amorphous silicon or CIGS; old inverters with low efficiencies; dual-axis trackers with prism tracking etc.
Such asset collections involve the management of plants of very different sizes and technologies, which undoubtedly adds complexity and increases operation and maintenance (O&M) costs due to the different requirements of each plant and the impossibility of implementing standardised maintenance which could benefit from an economy of scale.
The confluence of one or more of the scenarios described above in a single plant, which is very common, justifies revamping from a cost-benefit point of view. First, by an increase in the efficiency of the components with a direct influence on the performance ratio (especially modules and inverters); secondly, by the possibility of correcting installation faults with a direct impact on electrical safety and loss of energy yield; thirdly, by the possibility of reducing O&M costs through standardisation and the smaller number of elements in operation; and finally, by the added remuneration thanks to the extension of the plant’s useful life.
