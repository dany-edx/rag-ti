Speaking at the inaugural national electric vehicle summit in Canberra on Friday, Bowen said growing Australia’s EV market and improving fuel efficiency standards will be the focus of a National Electric Vehicle Strategy to be developed in conjunction with state and territory leaders.
“We believe that now is the time to have an orderly and sensible discussion about whether vehicle fuel efficiency standards could help improve the supply of electric vehicles into the Australian market,” he said.
“To me, this is ultimately about choice. And policy settings are denying Australians real choice of good, affordable, no-emissions cars.”
Bowen said at last count, consumers in the United Kingdom could take their pick of 26 low-emissions vehicles under $60,000. In Australia that number is only eight.
“This lack of availability has led, unsurprisingly, to a lack of sales,” he said. “Just 2% of cars sold here are electric and plug-in hybrid, compared to 15% in the United Kingdom, and 17% in Europe as a whole.”

Bowen said a discussion paper on the National Electric Vehicle Strategy will be released for consultation in September, seeking feedback from industry, unions and consumer bodies.
At the heart of the strategy will be a plan to accelerate the uptake of EVs and improve affordability and choice by implementing fuel efficiency standards for manufacturers to observe.
“Apart from Russia, Australia is the only OECD country to not have, or be in the process of developing, fuel efficiency standards,” Bowen said.
“We know from overseas experience, that with the right policy settings, EV penetration can increase quickly. Sweden, for example, increased its proportion of EV sales from 18% to 62% in two years.
“I want to see uptake of electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles at as fast a rate as possible, as is practical. And I think having a discussion about fuel efficiency standards will help that along.”
The consultation paper will also include discussion around the establishment of a national EV charging network with charging stations at an average interval of 150 kilometres on major roads, and plans for a national hydrogen highways refuelling network.

The government will also look to set a low-emissions vehicle target for the commonwealth fleet of 75% of new leases and purchases by 2025 in a bid to encourage more EV model introductions to Australia, and to expand a resale market.
Australia’s peak motoring body, the Australian Automobile Association (AAA), said it supported the introduction of a market-based mechanism to incentivise global car companies to prioritise Australia.
AAA managing director Michael Bradley said the government is right to be exploring how a light vehicle fuel efficiency standard can incentivise the supply of cleaner cars to our market but added a word of caution.
“Such an approach will boost supply of cleaner cars to our market more effectively, and at a lower cost to consumers, than the subsidies and other government assistance schemes sometimes called for,” he said. “However we need to be mindful of the factors which will continue to constrain Australia’s access to emerging technologies, such as our unique fuel quality, traditional vehicle preferences, and the fact we’re a relatively small right-hand-drive market.”

The 410 W Karra panel is made with 108 half-cut monocrystalline cells based on M10 wafers with a size of 182mm. It operates with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and a temperature coefficient of -0.34% per degree Celsius.

The new panel measures 1,731mm x 1,149mm x 40mm and weighs 21.5kg. It is built with fully tempered glass and is wrapped in a black anodised aluminium alloy frame. It comes with a 25-year product guarantee and a 25-year performance guarantee. End power output is guaranteed to be no less than 80% of the nominal output power.
Tindo chief executive officer Shayne Jaenisch said the 410 W Karra panel had been designed specifically to cater for an increasingly sophisticated rooftop solar market.
“Five years ago, Australians wanted solar power on their roofs, and the rebates and feed-in tariffs were designed to drive installations,” he said. “Now, the market is more focused on solar PV with battery, VPPs (virtual power plants), and a power supply with the most efficient and reliable output.”
Tindo said the first order for the panels, which are being manufactured at the company’s headquarters at Mawson Lakes in Adelaide, was from a large corporate buyer which is installing 200 kW systems on its property assets.
Jaenisch said the 410 W panel had been tested by TUV SUD Korea with engineers from the certification body confirming it produced power at about 21% module efficiency and 23.1% cell efficiency and recorded just 0.07% cell-to-module (CTM) loss ratio. Tindo said the industry average energy efficiency of a solar module is between 17 and 19%, and the average CTM loss is 2-3%.
“We should be proud that in Australia we have the engineers and the technical skills to commercially produce one of the highest-performing solar panels in the world, right here in Adelaide,” Jaenisch said.
“If Australia is going to lead the world in the energy transition, we have to develop a sovereign capability in renewables.”
Jaenisch said the company had looked to address growing demand for ethically and sustainably produced modules with the new panel coming with an end-of-life recycling guarantee.
“Australians are serious about recycling and forced labour,” he said. “We use a global assurance firm to audit our supply chains for issues such as forced labour, and we have a recycling guarantee so that decommissioned panels are recycled for industrial re-use by Reclaim PV.”

ACEN Australia chief executive Anton Rohner said the long-term loan will provide capital financing for the group’s eligible green assets in Australia as part of its strategic aspiration to be the largest listed renewables platform in Southeast Asia by the end of the decade.
“The initial green loan facility with DBS will help advance our fund-raising capacity of over $600 million in Australia to develop and construct existing and additional pipeline of renewable energy projects in Australia,” he said.
ACEN is seeking to grow its renewables capacity in the Asia Pacific region to 20 GW by 2030. The company said it will focus on solar and wind projects but will also investigate investment opportunities in other renewable technologies including battery energy storage, floating solar, and offshore wind.
The company said the Philippines will remain its core market but it plans to “aggressively grow its investments in Australia” which is expected to be its second largest market within the decade. ACEN said it will also continue to grow its presence in Vietnam, Indonesia and India.

ACEN chairman Fernando Zobel de Ayala said the company is committed to growing its renewables platform to reach its 20 GW target.
“It is an aggressive goal, though we believe that we have the right elements to succeed,” he said. “We have a strong balance sheet, robust pipeline, strong partnerships, and a highly energised organisation.”
The company, which already has ~4,000 MW of attributable capacity in the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, and Australia, has 18 GW pipeline of renewable energy projects across the region including the massive New England solar farm and battery project being developed near Uralla in northern New South Wales.
The $768 million project will eventually see a 720 MW solar farm co-located with a 50MW/50MWh battery energy storage system. Construction of the first 400 MW stage of the solar project is already underway and is slated for completion in 2023. Work has also commenced on the lithium-ion battery which has scope to be scaled up to 200 MW/400 MWh in the future.
Other projects in the company’s Australian portfolio include the 400MW Stubbo Solar Farm and associated 200 MW/200 MWh battery energy storage project in NSW; the proposed 600 MW Birriwa solar farm and battery project also in NSW; a share in the Rise Renewables 250MW Baroota pumped hydro and 300MW Bridle Track solar projects in South Australia; and the 160 MW Axedale Solar Farm in central Victoria, which may also come to include a battery energy storage system.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/19/results-of-long-term-study-of-module-degradation-released/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,QUALITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"AUGUST 19, 2022",Results of long-term study of module degradation released,"Any change to the contents of a PV module – whether moving to an entirely new cell technology, or simply changing the thickness of the glass in front of the cells– can affect its performance in the field and its susceptibility to different mechanisms that reduce performance over time.
Scientists led by Sandia National Laboratories in the United States investigated how frequent changes in module technology affect their long-term performance. The group purchased 834 PV modules from the open market between 2016 and 2018, and has since been carefully monitoring their performance installed at locations with varying climate conditions – New Mexico, Colorado and Florida.
Modules were selected from seven different manufacturers, covering 13 different module types. Based on the number of manufacturers included in the study, the selection represented 55% of the US module market in 2020, based on market figures from Wood Mackenzie.
Modules were flash-tested upon arrival at their installations (testing conducted by Sandia in New Mexico, the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, and the University of Central Florida. A sample of the installed modules was then tested annually and compared against control modules stored in a climate controlled dark room for the same time period.
The full testing procedure, along with the results, is described in “Onymous early-life performance degradation analysis of recent photovoltaic module technologies,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.

The study found that module degradation rates tend to stabilise after three to four years, and that additional flash-testing after this period could help system owners better ensure that modules are performing according to financial expectations.
They also noted significant differences between different bill of materials, even in modules from the same manufacturer. And the modules installed in the hot and humid subtropical climate in Florida saw a significantly degradation rate – though the study notes that a larger sample would be needed to verify this as a trend.
The degradation rate of 26.1% of modules installed exceeded the limits specified in the warranty, while 56.5% of those studied would continue to perform at better than 80% of their initial rating beyond 30 years in the field, assuming their degradation continues at the same rate.
“Although the costs declined sharply in the last decade, module degradation rates do not seem to be affected, at least for the sample investigated in this work,” the paper concludes. “This is a very encouraging result, but more opportunities exist to reduce Rd to levels that enable longer PV module lifetimes.”

To guide the development of faster-charging and longer-lasting batteries, scientists need to be able to understand the processes occurring inside of an operating battery and identify the limitations to its performance.
Currently, sophisticated synchrotron X-ray or electron microscopy are the most often used techniques in visualising active battery materials. However, they can be complicated and expensive, and not quick enough to capture the rapid changes happening in electrode materials.
Now, researchers at the University of Cambridge have applied a low-cost, laboratory-based optical microscopy method to study micrometer-sized rod-like particles of one of the fastest charging anode material today (Nb14W3O44) during high-rate cycling. They described their method in “Operando monitoring of single-particle kinetic state-of-charge heterogeneities and cracking in high-rate Li-ion anodes,” which was recently published in Nature Materials.
First, visible light was sent into the battery through a small glass window, allowing the researchers to watch the dynamic process within the active particles, in real time, under realistic non-equilibrium conditions. This revealed front-like lithium-concentration gradients moving through the individual active particles, resulting in internal strain which caused some particles to fracture. Particle fracture is a problem in batteries, as it can lead to electrical disconnection of the fragments, reducing the storage capacity of the battery.
“Such spontaneous events have severe implications for the battery but could never be observed in real time before now,” said researcher Christoph Schnedermann, from Cambridge’s Cavendish Laboratory.
The optical microscopy technique allowed the researchers to analyse a large population of particles. This revealed that particle cracking is more common with higher rates of delithiation and in longer particles.
“These findings provide directly-applicable design principles to reduce particle fracture and capacity fade in this class of materials” said researcher Alice Merryweather, a PhD candidate in Cambridge’s Cavendish Laboratory and Chemistry Department.
In addition to the rapid data acquisition, single-particle resolution, and high throughput capabilities, the novel technique is expected to facilitate further exploration of what happens when batteries fail and how to prevent it. It could also play a role in the development of next-generation batteries, as it can be used to study almost any type of battery material.
