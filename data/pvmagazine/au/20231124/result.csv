The project comprises a 27.4 MW solar farm at Mt Keith and a 10.7 MW solar farm and 10.1 MW/5.4 MWh battery energy storage system at nearby Leinster, all of which is now integrated into TransAlta’s existing 169 MW Southern Cross Energy North remote network.
TransAlta, which owns and will operate the facility as part of a power purchase agreement (PPA) extension signed in 2020, said the Northern Goldfields project is one of the largest off-grid solar and battery energy storage systems in the world with about 70,000 solar panels deployed across 90 hectares of land.
TransAlta President and Chief Executive Officer John Kousinioris said the ground-breaking project had delivered a number of firsts for the organisation.
“This facility represents a first for both companies – it’s BHP’s first on-site, large-scale renewable project globally, and it’s TransAlta’s first renewable energy facility in Australia,” he said.
“It’s also the first time we have combined solar and battery storage to offer a hybrid solution.”
BHP Australia President Geraldine Slattery said the Northern Goldfields solar and battery storage system, which will displace power currently supplied by diesel and gas turbine generation, will play a significant part in helping the miner decarbonise its operations in WA.
Slattery said the facility will help BHP reduce scope 2 emissions at its Leinster and Mt Keith operations by 12%, eliminating an estimated 540,000 tonnes of carbon emissions over the first 10 years of operation.
“Renewables are increasingly powering BHP operations around the globe and this facility – the first we have built on one of our sites – is another step forward in our plans to reduce our operational greenhouse gas emissions by at least 30% by FY30, from FY20 levels,” she said.
BHP said the Northern Goldfields Solar and Battery Storage Facility is just one of many ways Nickel West is reducing its operational emissions – it is also considering wind farms in the northern and southern Goldfields.

They store the energy needed to operate electric vehicles, motor scooters and skateboards (micromobility), provide the means for constant communication that our mobile phones afford us, power our portable computers, and many other applications. Thanks to their high energy density, they can be applied to most devices without adding to their bulk. Not only that, they can be charged and discharged continually with minimal capacity loss, contributing to their remarkable longevity. Even potential hazards, which have led to well-publicised cases of scooter and Tesla fires, have been reduced by increasingly safer battery designs and materials. For these and many other excellent reasons, lithium-ion will continue to play a prominent role in the technologies of our electrified future.
But there’s more than this and it casts a shadow on lithium-ion’s future for long-term storage. I have worked in several roles in the field of physical and chemical research for the past quarter-century, with an eye towards studying and using the properties of natural elements and (nano)materials for their ability to safely and efficiently store energy. 
A particularly stubborn focus surrounds lithium due to years of research and investment pushing it into the realm of large-scale energy storage. After all, if you can power your electric vehicle with lithium-ion batteries, shouldn’t you be able to back up the power of a major metropolis in those inevitable moments when the sun isn’t shining, or the wind isn’t blowing?

While there have been some seeming success stories like the world’s once largest lithium battery, the Hornsdale Power Reserve, unfortunately, the answer is no. For starters, lithium is a finite resource. The US Geological Survey estimates that there are about 88 million metric tonnes of lithium in the world. Only a quarter of these resources can be profitably mined. 
While we can presume that improvements in mining technologies will continue to convert even more of these resources into reserves over time, the electrification of our economies will require us to move quickly to obtain them. And let’s not mince words — the burden of proof will be on mining industries to demonstrate that it can be extracted in a sustainable and ethical fashion. It is uncertain if the industry can meet these mandates, especially given the ongoing child labor issues associated with the mining of cobalt, a similarly finite mineral used in the cathodes of many lithium-ion battery chemistries, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where well over half of the world’s cobalt is mined.
While this might present an opportunity for Australian cobalt mining, the fixed nature of a lithium-ion battery’s power-to-energy ratio makes it unsuitable for applications like long-duration grid energy storage, where much more energy is needed than power. Simply describing what a power-to-energy ratio entails, all battery designs must counterbalance the speed with which the maximum amount of energy can be delivered (power) with its energy storage capacity (energy). Because of the fixed relationship between both in a lithium-ion battery, battery manufacturers are forced to make trade-offs between one and the other.

Grid batteries serve mainly two purposes: they must provide high power for short durations to stabilise the grid during sudden demand spikes (which can be comfortably covered by lithium-ion batteries), and provide power over extended periods  to compensate for prolonged gaps in renewable energy generation (where lithium-ion batteries are very unsuitable). To address the latter purpose with lithium, would require us to “overbuild” power significantly, which is, for all of the above reasons, unsustainable and will cause the easily mined lithium reserves to deplete very rapidly.
So where does that leave us? Fortunately, there are options, but they require embracing disruptive innovation, not incrementalism. We simply can’t revolutionise the way we do energy storage without thinking in genuinely revolutionary ways. The “Battery Supply Chains: Briefing Paper” released by the think-tank Beyond Zero Emissions (BZE) today provides compelling evidence for the necessary reforms to ensure the security of Australia’s battery supply chain and drive the transformation of our manufacturing industry and economy.
Beyond Zero Emissions’ report on battery manufacturing calls on the government to double its investment in encouraging battery-based projects that increase grid reliability as we switch to cleaner energy. We want those jobs here in our country and for Australia to supply its own needs rather than relying on other countries.
This report also calls for a $2 billion (USD 1.31 billion) capital investment to help build factories to manufacture batteries onshore. This would help us to rapidly accelerate our nation’s potential to become a leading centre for green energy storage innovation and manufacture.
For long-term storage that also means looking at alternatives like redox-flow batteries using abundant, and low-hazard materials. Luckily, there are already promising alternatives emerging — what we need now is the courage of our convictions and the willingness to go big and go bold in the solutions this planet needs.

AGL said the Victorian-based $1.78 million Dynamic Pricing Load Flex Project will initially focus on energy load control at the airport, a major supermarket chain, a warehouse and logistics company, and a water utility company to demonstrate flexible demand capacity. If successful, the trial could free up 25 MW of energy during peak periods.
ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said demand flexibility has been identified as a viable solution to the evolving requirements of the electricity grid, offering a way to reduce the load on the grid during busy periods.
“Unlocking flexible demand at commercial and industrial sites can free up electricity capacity at times of high demand and consume electricity when renewable electricity is abundant,” he said.
“This will help us create a truly smart, adaptable and efficient energy grid.”
The four Melbourne-based sites involved in the trial offer up a potential of 385 MW load management across the National Electricity Market (NEM) with the price forecasting tool to provide those customers with access to 30-minute pricing updates based on solar and wind generation forecasts and thermal generator availability over a seven-day period.
The energy management systems at the sites will allow the customers to respond to price signals to plan their energy use to match supply and demand.
AGL Chief Customer Officer Jo Egan said the project marks the first step in the utility developing a load flex product for its commercial and industrial customers.
“Flexible demand projects like this enable AGL to develop our technological expertise in harnessing renewable energy while also exploring novel ways to reduce customer costs,” she said. “We look forward to sharing the knowledge of the trial with ARENA and our participating partners to optimise the transition to renewable energy.”
AGL expects to start developing the software and hardware early next year and will share findings from the trial later in 2024 with the final report due in mid-2025.

The consortium has previously said its bid at $9.43 a share was its “best and final” offer but the proposal has come under fire with Origin’s largest shareholder, superannuation giant AustralianSuper saying the proposal substantially undervalues the utility’s long-term value.
Origin said ahead of Thursday’s planned meeting that based on proxy results received, it was unlikely the original offer would have achieved the required 75% approval by shareholders.
Under the new proposal, the $9.43 per share bid remains but shareholders would have the right to reinvest into the energy markets business that would be owned by Brookfield. EIG would take on Origin’s integrated gas business which includes the 27.5% stake in Australia Pacific LNG.
If the scheme isn’t approved, the new proposal has the option that would see Origin sell the energy markets business to Brookfield for $12.3 billion ($8 billion) and EIG making an off-market takeover offer for its LNG business that would only need the acceptance of 50.1% of shareholders to succeed.
If this alternative transaction proceeds, Origin shareholders would receive $9.08 per share and an additional $0.22 if EIG gets at least 90% acceptance of its takeover proposal.
Origin’s board said in a statement that while the alternative transaction may present an additional opportunity for shareholders to receive cash value for their shares, it appeared “inferior” to the existing scheme.
“The board has significant reservations as to the complexity, conditionality and differing value, and potential adverse tax outcomes to Origin and shareholders, nevertheless the board has a responsibility to fully assess this revised proposal, so it can provide an informed view about its merits or otherwise to shareholders,” Origin said.
Origin also noted that the federal government’s announcement that it intends to expand its Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) to deliver 9 GW of dispatchable capacity and 23 GW of variable capacity nationally could impact on the utility’s market share.
“This represents a potential source of significant new generation supply into, and a meaningful intervention in, the National Electricity Market,” it said.
“While the impacts on Origin of the expanded CIS cannot be determined at this point, the board has concluded that shareholders should be given the opportunity to consider this development in the context of the scheme.”
Origin said the rescheduled scheme meeting will now be held 4 December 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/24/new-solution-to-suppress-battery-storage-fire-thermal-runaway-unveiled-by-fike/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"NOVEMBER 24, 2023","New solution to suppress battery storage fire, thermal runaway unveiled by Fike","From pv magazine Global
Preventing thermal runaway – a rapid and dangerous release of heat and gases which can lead to fires in lithium-ion batteries – is the big conundrum plaguing both electric mobility and stationary storage industries. With battery thermal incidents a relatively new phenomenon, companies are wrapping their heads around suppression methods and the best ways of dealing with self-sustaining battery fires that are difficult to put out.
The latest company that claims to have found a solution to this issue is US-based Fike Corp. Its Fike Blue solution is billed as “the first tested and patented solution that not only suppresses the fire but also stops cascading thermal runaway.”
Fike has developed a tank with a liquid that has a boiling point of more than 400 C without breaking down.  When a heat anomaly is detected, a releasing panel activates the cylinder to flow Fike Blue throughout the piping network. However, only in the module where the fire is located will the nozzle open and discharge the liquid, immersing the cells and absorbing the heat. The temperatures for all cells dramatically decrease over the course of several minutes until the event and chance for re-ignition is over.
Fike said it has various ways to detect thermal events in battery energy storage systems.
“Depending on the users’ goals, we can use multiple detection options including industrial gas detection, Fike Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) cables, traditional spot detection, and more,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
For these detection methods, a SHP Pro or Fike Cheetah Xi fire panel is necessary, connecting to the battery management system (BMS) to halt charging circuits upon thermal event detection and activate local notification systems.
Today, water-based fire suppression systems are touted as most effective at cooling a battery fire. However, while they can cool down the battery and help prevent the spread of fire, they cannot extinguish battery fires until the energy is dissipated and accompanied by the release of dangerous off-gases. The possibility of re-ignition is not eliminated.
Fike’s solution uses significantly less liquid than sprinklers and firefighters, reducing runoff into the environment. The agent is said to be “far less conductive than water, as all tests performed either by Fike or by a third party have yet to witness the shorting of any cells.”
Third-party testing by the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) showed that Fike Blue suppressed thermal runaway heat within five minutes, preventing further cell spread. While it has not specified the chemical composition of its agent, Fike said that its does not fall under the family of PFAS. It said its patented liquid can be stored for at least five years at 25 C without the formation of precipitates or sediment.
“Fike is the only safety solutions provider in the world who can perform a Battery Hazard Analysis (BHA) with Fike Blue, ensuring you’ll pass the UL 9540A test [test method for evaluating thermal runaway fire propagation in battery energy storage systems],” Fike said.
