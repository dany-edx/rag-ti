Even to most people working in photovoltaics, her work would seem arcane, and yet it has, says UNSW, “profound implications for solar and chemical energy conversion applications such as … generating renewable hydrogen economically and sustainably”. And Amal herself is a wonderfully plain speaker.
When she was awarded the prestigious 2021 Chemeca Medal by the Australian and New Zealand Federation of Chemical Engineers on Thursday, Amal described her research in recent years as focused on “harnessing solar energy to produce chemicals and fuels, such as hydrogen”.
Her LinkedIn feed is bursting with congratulations on the award which specifically recognises her research into catalysts for efficient energy conversion. 
Ian Phillips, General Manager at Photon Water Australia, part of the Photon Energy Group posted: “Rose Amal you continue to teach, learn, and inspire new generations of engineers and scientists. And with research that the world badly needs. Well done and congratulations to you and the team behind!”
Kristy Muir, CEO of the Centre for Social Impact and Professor at the UNSW Business School commented, “Congratulations Rose! You’re amazing!”. This simple attribution echoes the sentiment expressed by Professor Nicholas Fisk, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Research and Enterprise, at UNSW who commented on Amal’s award saying: “Rose is at the forefront of fundamental particle and catalysis R&D in Australia in areas which directly impact people’s lives.”

Research papers she has contributed to may be characterised by titles such as: Nanofluidic voidless electrode for electrochemical capacitance enhancement in gel electrolyte, but they represent the chemical bedrock on which future sustainability is being built, or as the abstract of this 2021 paper (one of a dozen or so Amal has co-authored so far this year) explains, its findings “are valuable to solid-state electrochemical energy storage technologies that require high-efficiency charge transport”.
In January this year, Amal contributed to a breakthrough paper — A hybrid plasma electrocatalytic process for sustainable ammonia production — which describes a process of producing green ammonia (used mainly in fertilisers, but a promising means of fuelling international shipping, and transporting/storing hydrogen) from air, water and solar energy without the emissions or demands on energy and infrastructure made by the traditional Haber-Bosch method of ammonia production.
Said co-author UNSW’s Dr Emma Lovell, at the time: “The current way we make ammonia … produces more CO2 than any other chemical-making reaction. In fact, making ammonia consumes about 2 percent of the world’s energy and makes 1 percent of its CO2.”
Amal said the research showed, “We can use electrons from solar farms to make ammonia and then export our sunshine as ammonia rather than hydrogen.” 
Storage and transport of hydrogen as ammonia will be safer and more economical. As a gas, hydrogen requires an exceptional amount of space for storage unless you liquefy or compress it, “but liquid ammonia actually stores more hydrogen than liquid hydrogen itself,” explained Amal, “and so there has been increasing interest in the use of ammonia as a potential energy vector for a carbon-free economy.”
Batteries are fine, but why not onsite green fuel production for industry
In February, Amal was appointed by the NSW Office of the Chief Scientist & Engineer as head of a consortium made up of researchers from UNSW, the Universities of Sydney, Wollongong and Newcastle, and the CSIRO. The remit of their combined NSW Power-to-X (P2X) Industry Feasibility Study, is “to grow a new industry that will use cheap excess renewable energy to make fuel, chemicals and feedstocks to power a range of New South Wales infrastructure”.
At the Australian Renewable Energy Zones Conference in May Amal talked about why using only batteries, a capital-intensive technology, to store renewable energy is a missed opportunity. 
With the P2X approach of converting excess renewable energy to chemical energy — as hydrogen, ammonia, methanol or hydrogen peroxide — “we can widen the reach of renewable power and repurpose it for use in other sectors while still maintaining stability in the grid”, she said.
These broadly applied chemicals “have historically been made in large, centralised industrial sites where capital costs and emissions are high”, said Amal, adding that they then have to be transported to a point of use.
With P2X, production of such chemicals can be decentralised, it can occur at or near the point of consumption, “with zero emissions and zero waste”, she summarised.

She believes that a significant opportunity for P2X is to supply a new hydrogen export industry — with Japan, Korea and the European Union among the markets  in line for Australia’s green hydrogen.
To advance this potential, Amal is also one of a consortium of research and industry partners, known as HySupply and  led by UNSW’s Associate Professor Iain MacGill, investigating the feasibility of a renewable-energy-based hydrogen supply chain between Germany and Australia.                 
Amal, who arrived in Australia from Indonesia 38 years ago to pursue a degree in Chemical Engineering at UNSW, may have become accustomed to recognition — she has been awarded 2019 NSW Scientist of the Year and has received several prestigious engineering awards.
An inspiration to students and the teams she leads, she exemplifies how fundamental research can translate into a multi-dimensional contribution to economic prosperity and a better way of living.
In the early 1990s, her passion for sustainability was, she says, “focused on designing particle and catalyst systems to treat chemical pollutants so that they would not end up in our environment”.
Subsequently, the solar industry got lucky as she swung her skills towards designing nanomaterials for solar and chemical energy conversion applications, including photocatalysis for water and air purification and water splitting and engineering systems for solar processes that use the sun’s energy to generate clean fuel.
Putting it simply, Amal says, “Australia has abundant sunlight and we should do more in harnessing our solar power.”

But the road to green thermal adoption — or the decarbonisation of heat processes — requires business plans that anticipate maturing green technologies and build in the flexibility to switch as those technologies become available and commercially attractive. Influential factors might include when the cost of electricity generated by expanding solar and wind installation is consistently close to zero, or markets putting a price on carbon…
Engie Impact, the strategic and engineering advisory arm of French energy giant Engie, has, for example, been working with a client that produces chemical and consumer goods, using processes that require temperatures of about 250 degrees Celsius. 
“It’s a mid-temperature application,” explains Josh Martin, Senior Director of Engie Impact Australia , “and they were looking to invest in a more efficient gas heating solution, but they also wanted a deeper analysis of the green solutions, which include biomass boilers, biomethane boilers or green electric heaters.”
On a strictly financial basis, Engie Impact found the cost of switching to a green thermal supply would be 18% higher than gas boilers, “but once we accounted for a carbon price, the business case became more favourable”, Martin tells pv magazine Australia. In fact, electric heaters powered by renewable energy sources were found to offer the lowest total cost when the carbon price was considered, and significantly reduced the company’s greenhouse gas emissions over the asset lifetime.
Engie Impact exists solely to accelerate decarbonisation. It started Australian operations early this year with a staff of nine, and is now building additional teams of five in both Sydney and Perth to meet demand.
Martin says, “It’s good to see that organisations are taking this seriously; probably the most humbling thing to me is that we’re seeing a lot of action.”
That said, a global assessment by Engie Impact of companies with science-based emissions-reduction targets found that although 65% have made significant strides in procuring renewable sources of electricity, ”only 27% have done the same for heat”.
For low-temperature heat requirements, such as space heating of buildings, available technologies such as solar collectors and heat pumps are not being leveraged in any significant quantities, says Martin, who adds, “I think it’s likely because there’s a lack of knowledge around them — on the electricity side, everyone knows about LED lights, but the average person wouldn’t be able to explain the concepts behind a heat pump.”
Industrial heat demand, however, is forecast by the International Energy Agency to continue to grow, and is expected to account for “a quarter of global emissions by 2040”.
The challenges of transitioning heat processes are complex because, unlike fairly generic requirements of heating residential and commercial buildings, industrial heat processes require a range of temperature levels for different processes and end uses, and the heat is often generated on site by assets that have a lifespan of up to 40 years.
As in the chemical and consumer-goods example, there may be a case for switching out the existing technology sooner than its projected end of life, but that depends on a number of factors, including energy-market conditions, consumer demand, net-zero targets of countries and individual corporations, and the value that organisations place on producing greener goods or just running cleaner.
Complexity in individual industries such as steel production, is compounded by the fact that some technologies, such as replacing coking coal with green hydrogen in the steel manufacturing process are still being trialled. Other technologies, such as electric arc furnaces are proven and available, but only account for part of the steel manufacturing process and only reduce emissions by 50% over coal or gas-fired blast furnaces.

Martin believes that the time for trialling technologies to replace fossil-fuelled heat processes is limited, and that investment in the most promising technologies should be scaled up now in order to meet decarbonisation goals.
At the same time, he says, organisations need to plan their exit from reliance on fossil fuels to generate heat: “It’s about understanding what the solutions are, investing in developing those technologies in terms of R&D and supply chains, and having industry ready to switch, with a smooth transition to green solutions as they emerge, and as current technologies come to their end of life.”
The availability of investment capital and policy settings that incentivise transition are essential, he says.
An Engie Impact global publication, Green Thermal: How to Build Roadmaps to Decarbonise Heat, offers four strategies for policymakers:
Its recommendations for organisations are necessarily complex but clear:
Martin also cautions against spending corporate funds on carbon offsets that could better be spent on developing pathways for integration of green-energy heat processes: “You obviously don’t want to be diverting funds away from technological solutions that offer permanent displacement of carbon emissions,” he says. 
Engie Impact works with its clients on identifying tailored pathways to decarbonisation, and the business cases for deploying various solutions; the next step can be to partner with the organisation on research and development of the solution, with the aim of demonstrating that it can work at commercial scale.
Engie Impact’s parent company Engie, for example, recently partnered with Yara Pilbara Fertilisers to show the feasibility of transitioning Yara’s ammonia plant from using natural gas in its heat-reliant processes, to using green hydrogen.
The project progressed in May this year when it was awarded $42.5 million in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) to develop a 10 MW onsite solar farm and electrolyser that will directly supply the plant with renewable hydrogen, ultimately producing green ammonia for the Australian market and for export.
In September, Engie Impact also celebrated the global launch of its Ellipse carbon-intelligence platform, which Martin says goes a step further than current tools which typically digest data and report on emissions levels. 
Rather, it “leverages machine learning and AI to help companies establish decarbonisation pathways and track those pathways”, he explains.
Using the platform does require some expertise to ensure it is fed the most accurate and best-available data, so that managers can confidently interpret the outputs for decision making. That expertise may be available within an organisation, or Engie Impact’s advisory team can assist, says Martin.
However companies go about it, decarbonising heat processes needs to be thought through, says Martin: “You have to be able to demonstrate to investors that you’ve optimised your solutions for the right technologies at the least cost.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/04/comparing-new-solar-module-formats/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"OCTOBER 4, 2021",Comparing new solar module formats,"From pv magazine Global
The introduction of new wafer formats has seen the industry quickly divide into two camps promoting either the 182mm or the larger 210mm format. The smaller of the two promises significant gains in module performance without requiring a major redesign of other system components, while the larger promises even larger energy yields, but taking into account the larger size and different electrical characteristics of these modules, taking full advantage will require much more disruption in system design, shipping and elsewhere along the value chain.
This is further demonstrated in a new white paper published by Chinese module producer JA Solar, in cooperation with TÜV Nord. Early in 2021, the two set up a test field in Yinchuan, China to compare JA Solar’s DeepBlue 3.0 modules, which utilise the 182mm wafer, with others from an unnamed manufacturer utilising the 210mm format promoted by Zhonghuan Semiconductor.
Initial results from the project were published earlier this year, and now a second white paper offers results based on six months monitoring the modules in the field. The two module types are installed at a site in Yinchuan, China. According to JA Solar, this site is an arid environment with an average temperature of 8.5 Celsius degrees and up to 3000 hours of sunshine per year. Single-sided modules amounting to approximately 7 kW for each type are installed on fixed-tilt racking at a 40 degrees angle one meter above the ground. Both module sets are connected to a 20 kW inverter. The study only uses data from a DC side meter, to avoid measuring the effects of the inverter as well as the modules.
Based on the operational data from February to August 2021, the project found that JA Solar’s module average daily energy yield reached 4.88 kWh per kW, placing it around 1.9% higher than the 4.77kWh/kW achieved by the 210mm modules. The data also show that on days with higher solar irradiation, from May to July in particular, the gap in average energy yield between the two module types widens to 2.5%,” the manufacturer said.
JA solar attributes the lower yield from the larger modules to issues stemming from the higher currents they produce. “Theoretically, as the internal resistance loss of 182 modules is relatively lower, differences in power generation performance of the two types of modules is caused by the difference in the internal resistance loss and its resulting difference in operating temperature,” they explain in the white paper.
Delving further into the performance data, they found that the average operating temperature of JA Solar’s module was 1.7 Celsius degrees lower than the 210mm module. “…the difference in operating temperature mainly stems from radiation intensity,” they explain. “This demonstrates that the advantage of 182 modules in power generation from May to July is from the widening gap in operating temperature between the two kinds of modules.”
The comparison test site is set to run for a full year, and JA Solar says it will publish a complete analysis of the full-year performance data.
