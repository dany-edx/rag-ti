As part of a joint venture with Singapore outfit Ampyr Energy, Shell is proposing to develop a 500 MW / 1,000 MWh battery in Wellington, central New South Wales near Dubbo.
The battery would be one of the state’s, and indeed Australia’s, largest and is seeking to store the energy soon to be produced at the Central West Orana Renewable Energy Zone – the first REZ cab off the rank in New South Wales.

According to the companies, the Wellington BESS, as it’s called, has been under development for over 18 months and its Environmental Impact Statement is expected to be released for public consultation later this month.
The project is being jointly developed by the two companies and, subject to approvals and finance, construction is set to begin by the middle of next year.
Once operational, Shell Energy says it will hold the rights to charge and dispatch energy from the battery.
As part of another joint venture, this time a 50/50 split with the UK-based asset manager Foresight Group, Shell has purchased the Kondinin Energy project. 
Approximately 245 kilometres east of Perth, the project comprises various stages of 370 MW of developments across wind, solar and battery energy storage system assets.
The acquisition marks Shell’s first West Australian renewable development.

The Kondinin project is already in the advanced stages with land and development approvals in place, having been organised by former owner Lacour Energy.
The first stage of the project involves a 121 MW wind farm, with another 114 MW to be added in stage two. The project also has the potential to develop up to 80 MW of solar capacity over 125 hectares of land.
Finally, there is the possibility of fitting a battery system with up to 60 MW / 120 MWh total storage.
Located in what’s known as the WA Wheat Belt, Shell Australia’s chair, Tony Nunan, believes the project is “strategically placed” to support decarbonisation of the mining and resources sector ongoing in the state.
Pending its final investment decision, construction of the Stage 1 Wind farm is anticipated to occur in 2024.

In terms of how Foresight fits into the picture, the UK group manages the Australian Renewables Income Fund, which has acquired the 50% interest in the project. It’s worth noting that Foresight now operates the former Infrastructure Capital Group – it acquired that group and its assets back in July.
Foresight claims to be one of Australia’s largest private renewable generators, with over 1,150 MW of local operating renewable energy generation capacity – a status it has achieved through a series of acquisitions.
Under Infrastructure Capital Group, it acquired Meridian Energy Australia’s assets last year. It has also purchased Ginan solar and storage portfolio, Zenith Energy, and a majority investment in the Australian Renewable Energy Trust platform with Engie.
Kondinin Energy marks Foresight’s eighth transaction in Australia in the past 24 months.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/14/flexibility-as-the-key-shell-funded-to-transform-energy-demands-of-ci-sites/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,QUEENSLAND,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 14, 2022",Flexibility as the key: Shell funded to transform energy demands of C&I sites,"Having demonstrated its capacity to technically pull off the project through a pilot launched earlier this year at the Chirnside Park Shopping Centre, Shell Energy Australia has been awarded $9.1 million (USD 5.7 million) from Australian Renewable Energy Agency to expand its energy load control program ‘Commercialising Smart Energy Hubs.’
The $31.6 million program effectively involves building a ‘whole-of-site solution’ to optimise everything from the customer’s heating, ventilation and air conditioning, refrigeration, as well as onsite solar, storage and electric vehicle charging.
With the funding, Shell will recruit at least 40 shopping centres, supermarkets as well as a refrigeration distribution centre from across Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria to demonstrate the potential from making these commercial sites more flexible and responsive in their energy use.

This idea of simply using electricity more cleverly is an important and too-often overlooked component of decarbonisation. Known as flexible demand capacity, the concept basically involves load shifting – using more electricity in the middle of the day when the Australian grid is flooded with solar power – but through mechanisms capable of responding in real time to the network’s needs, market signals, and generation shortfalls. 
Or, in other words, it involves using a combination of hardware and software to respond to the real situation on the grid and adjust the site’s energy use accordingly. This feat holds multiple benefits for both the grid and the customer – smoothing electricity demand and lowering customer costs by cutting both their use and the necessity of purchasing power when it is selling for premium in the evenings.
In terms of what is happening as part of Shell’s program, the company is aiming to directly unlock 417 MW of flexible demand and be a catalyst to realise 1 GW of commercial and industrial flexible demand capacity across the National Electricity Market by the end of 2025.
To arrive there, the project aims to resolve some of the commercial and regulatory barriers which continue to impede the scaling up of such integrated flexibility solutions. It plans to do this by “unlocking new revenue streams and exploring regulatory change with the Wholesale Demand Response Mechanism (WDRM), the Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (RERT) and state-based certificates such as the NSW Peak Demand Reduction Scheme (PDRS),” ARENA says.
Shell has been developing and testing its commercial product, known as LoadFlex, which underpins the project, since 2019. It has been deployed at its pilot project at the Chirnside Park Shopping Centre in Victoria where the mix of predictive software and the addition of a 2 MWh battery and 650 kW solar array has led to load reductions of up to 70% during peak times.
Supporting flexible demand projects is a key focus for ARENA – and is undoubtedly a crucial component for getting the transition to renewable energy right.
The huge amounts of solar being generated around midday in Australia have already begun destabilising the grid here. For instance, South Australia last year became the first gigawatt-scale grid in the world to reach zero demand, meaning the generation from distributed assets like solar outstripped the local load – a phenomenon which has the potential to cause massive instability.

If done effectively though, flexible demand can be an antidote to this problem while also drastically cutting down the heavy power use of commercial and industrial sites.
“For commercial and industrial sites, flexible demand is a potential alternative to costly upgrades to network infrastructure or building large-scale batteries. To achieve the full potential of flexible demand, we will require new innovation, technologies and market processes,” ARENA CEO Darren Miller said.
“Shell Energy’s initiative represents ARENA’s first C&I project to demonstrate a whole of site optimisation of energy demand management for delivery of market, ancillary and customer benefits through the control of energy load.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/14/plan-to-turn-spent-gold-mine-into-pumped-hydro-facility-fast-tracked-by-queensland-government/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,PUMPED HYDRO,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 14, 2022",Plan to turn spent gold mine into pumped hydro facility fast tracked by Queensland government,"The Mt Rawdon Pumped Hydro Project, as it’s called, is being developed by gold miner Evolution Mining, alongside financial consultancy ICA Partners. 
The plan is to use the enormous pit dug from decades of mining at Evolution Mining’s Mt Rawdon gold mine, which sits about 75 kilometres southwest of Bundaberg, as the lower reservoir in the pumped hydro facility. The low-grade gold mining operation there is slated for closure in 2027 – meaning the project would breathe new financial life into a spent asset, as well as holding interesting rehabilitation prospects for the site.
The Mt Rawdon project is aiming for a pretty decent capacity – capable of providing 2 GW of energy for 10 hours, or, in other words, it will provide 20 GWh of storage. 
The full feasibility study for the project is already underway and is slated for completion by mid-2023.
In the meantime, Queensland’s Coordinator-General has declared it a Coordinated Project, a classing that will help streamline and fast track its negotiations with the state government.

For the project to be fully realised, a second upper reservoir would also need to be built – though this is something the company’s Executive Chair, Jake Klein, says the site loans itself to. Indeed, looking at Google maps, there is already another sandy looking hole just off to the left of the mining pit. 
The location appears to have other perks alongside the pre-dug open pit, including steep surrounding hills and just 22 kilometres separating it from major transmission lines.
Like all pumped hydro projects, the plan is expected to run into the multibillions – though Klein signalled to The Australian last year that the Queensland government may be interested in acquiring the project, if the feasibility study holds enough promise.
Last month, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk launched the state’s $62 billion Energy and Jobs Plan, which places publicly-owned pumped hydro schemes at its centre. 
As part of the scheme, the Premier announced two major pumped hydro projects, the enormous 5 GW / 120 GWh Pioneer-Burdekin project and the 2 GW Borumba Pumped Hydro project near Brisbane, which has been on the cards for some time.
It appears the state government is still interested in hedging its bets though – or perhaps even developing additional storage sites – especially in light of how difficult it is to find locations for pumped hydro facilities of such scale.

As part of Queensland’s new energy plan, the state is now aiming for 70% of the state’s energy supply to come from renewables by 2032, and 80% by 2035. While these targets are hardly Australia’s most ambitious from a state government, the vision is pretty significant in that it represents a major U-turn from one of the country’s more conservative, coal holdouts.
According to the Mt Rawdon Pumped Hydro Project’s website, the company is hoping for the facility to come into operations by 2029 – a fairly optimistic outlook. 
While Evolution Mining doesn’t appear to want to actually develop or own the project itself, it is planning to use the renewable electricity potentially generated in its Mt Rawdon pit to decarbonise its mines – of which there are currently five, including the Cowal gold mine in New South Wales, Ernest Henry in Queensland, Mungari in Western Australia, and Red Lake in Ontario, Canada.

“Our plan to convert Mt Rawdon into a pumped hydro renewable energy asset has the potential to create significant value to shareholders while also being a model mine closure,” executive chair Klein said. 
“It demonstrates that by thinking differently we can continue to contribute to the local and state communities after mine closure and support the renewable energy transition.”
It would also provide the company will an interesting rehabilitation plan for its spent assets – turning what is effectively a big hole into a potentially lucrative income.
The company said its project team is continuing to engage with key stakeholders including the First Nations Partners at Mt Rawdon and all levels of government.
In other Queensland gold mine turned pumped hydro news, the Kidston Pumped Hydro Project, in the state’s north, reached two major milestones this week ahead of its expected completion by early 2025.

The 250MW/2GWh Kidston Project has received approval under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and the first delivery of parts for the pumped hydro station have arrived at the Port of Townsville.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/14/india-expected-to-annually-deploy-35-40-gw-of-renewables-until-2030/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"OCTOBER 14, 2022",India expected to annually deploy 35-40 GW of renewables until 2030,"From pv magazine India
India’s renewable energy installations will surge rapidly with 35-40 GW added annually through to the fiscal year (FY) 2029-30, according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and Climate Energy Finance (CEF).
With this, India will reach a renewable energy capacity of 405 GW in FY 2029-30–on track to surpass its target of 50% of its energy from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. 
Thermal power, on the other hand, is set to progressively lose market share, with the expanding use of domestically produced thermal energy in response to recent global events likely to be a “short-term hiccup”, the report says. 
“India has been one of the champions globally in adopting renewable energy as part of its energy transition. While recent headwinds faced by the renewable energy sector and rapidly rising power demand has forced the government to re-look at thermal power as a short-term fix, the government’s clean energy capacity addition targets, as well as commitments by various corporations, remain ambitious,” says the report’s co-author Vibhuti Garg, director, South Asia, IEEFA. 
In the utility-scale segment, the top 16 players are expected to deploy a cumulative RE capacity of 231 GW in the eight years ending in 2030. The estimation is based on these players’ current capacities and commitments. Leading the list is state-owned NTPC, which targets 60 GW of cumulative RE capacity by 2030 from the current 5.7 GW. Adani Green Energy targets 45 GW and Tata Power, ReNew Power, and Acme Solar 25 GW each.
“The Indian government seems unbending in ensuring the renewable energy targets are met through facilitating growth across the sector’s spectrum. Financially strong investors, such as the Indian government, domestic conglomerates, and some of the biggest global investors, back most industry players, lending them the firepower needed to fulfil their capacity addition targets,” says Garg.
Beyond utility-scale capacity additions, rooftop solar, solar pumps, and renewable energy capacity addition by non-power public sector companies will supplement power generation from non-fossil fuel sources.
“On the decentralized renewable energy side, several segments have the potential to grow multifold as policy-side reforms streamline current bottlenecks and demand-side drivers provide lucrative returns,” says co-author Shantanu Shrivastava, energy finance analyst, IEEFA. 
“On the demand side, green hydrogen is a major force that promises to massively drive India’s clean energy ambitions. Corporates, such as the Adani Group and Reliance Industries, have wholeheartedly supported the country’s green hydrogen policy, announced in June 2022, and its 5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) target, with several major commitments.” 
The report finds that India’s green hydrogen target of 5 MTPA by 2030 will require an additional renewable energy capacity of 118 GW.  
To put the ambitions of Indian corporates into context, the report also undertakes a study of similar clean energy commitments by four global majors – NextEra Energy (U.S.), RWE (Germany), Ørsted (Denmark), and Enel (Italy). 
“Understanding the clean energy commitments of domestic players compared with global counterparts also provides perspective on where India’s renewable energy plans stand relative to international developments and what Indian utility players can leverage from the experience of global leaders,” says co-author Tim Buckley, Director, CEF. 
“We find that the ambitious decarbonisation targets of the four global companies, which do not rely on carbon offsets or carbon capture and storage, have helped their share prices outperform broader equity markets. It has also helped the companies tap a rapidly growing global green bond market.”

Hard carbons appear to be one of the most suitable candidates for anode materials for sodium-ion batteries because of their electrochemical performance and relative ease of production. This class of materials can be obtained from a variety of precursors, and the most ecologically sustainable route is the synthesis from biomass.
Researchers from Moscow State University (MSU) and Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) have developed a high-quality anode material from an unlikely source – Heracleum sosnowskyi, a highly invasive plant, which is dangerous for humans and can cause skin burns but produces a large amount of green biomass in a short time.
“We thought, wouldn’t it be fun to take something as nasty and objectionable as hogweed and make something useful out of it,” said co-author Zoya Bobyleva of Lomonosov Moscow State University. “The thing about hard carbon materials, used in sodium-ion battery anodes, is you can make them from biomass of virtually any origin. No one has considered hogweed before. But it turned out pretty well.”
The hard carbon produced by the MSU-Skoltech team exhibited a Coulombic efficiency of 87%, which is on par with the best reported results for hard carbons synthesised from other raw materials. As for the energy storage capacity, at about 260 mAh/g, the material falls short of the best results reported elsewhere — around 300 mAh/g. In addition, it  demonstrated capacity retention of 95% after 100 charge-discharge cycles in sodium half-cells.
In “Sosnowskyi Hogweed-Based Hard Carbons for Sodium-Ion Batteries,” which was recently published in Batteries, the researchers proposed a simple synthesis method that includes the pretreatment stage and further carbonisation at 1,300 C. The new anode was demonstrated in full sodium-ion cells with NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode material.
