The Central-West Orana REZ is the first of five designated clean energy zones detailed in the NSW Government’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap. REZs will also be developed in the New England, Hunter-Central Coast, South-West and Illawarra regions.
Kean said as Australia’s first REZ, the Central-West Orana REZ is pivotal to the NSW government’s plan to inject at least 12GW of renewable energy and 2GW of energy storage into the grid before 2030 to fill the gap created by the retirement of the state’s thermal-fuel generation fleet.
“Renewable Energy Zones are modern-day power stations that will revolutionise the way energy is generated and transmitted across the state,” he said.
Stage 1 of the Central-West Orana REZ, which encompasses approximately 20,000 square kilometres centred on the inland town of Dubbo, is planned to unlock at least 3GW of new network capacity by the mid-2020s, enough to power 1.4 million homes.
The registration of interest process conducted last year sparked an overwhelming response from investors with more than 27GW of potential renewable and storage projects valued at $38 billion received.
Much of that proposed capacity could now be unlocked with Kean saying the new transmission corridor, which redirects the eastern section of the route, shifting it away from the Merriwa Cassilis plateau to instead go through mining areas around Ulan, could cater for nearly four times the original amount of renewable power.

“The revised study corridor for new transmission infrastructure will minimise impacts on prime agricultural land in the region and enable us to deliver greater capacity for the Central-West Orana REZ to meet future energy needs,” Kean said.
“As the new route can accommodate additional transmission lines, it gives us options to deliver nearly four times the amount of renewable power to the grid with the same infrastructure.”
Member for the Upper Hunter David Layzell said the redesign meant the corridor avoided significant areas of high-quality agricultural land.
“The majority of the revised corridor is now located on land owned by mining companies or alongside existing transmission lines, minimising the impact on prime agricultural land,” he said.
Minister for Western NSW and Member for the Dubbo electorate Dugald Saunders said the Central-West Orana REZ will attract about $5.2 billion of private investment and support around 3,900 peak construction jobs and 500 ongoing jobs.
“This is about getting the balance right in a way that boosts the economic and employment benefits for local communities, without compromising the assets that make this region so unique,” he said.
The Energy Corporation of NSW (EnergyCo) will lead a competitive process to appoint a network operator to design, build, finance and maintain the new transmission infrastructure in the REZ.
EnergyCo said it will conduct community consultation sessions and technical studies to refine the transmission alignment prior to lodging an Environmental Impact Statement for the project in early 2023.

The unveiling of the revised transmission route forms part of the NSW government’s response to last week’s announcement by Origin Energy that it will bring forward the closure of the Eraring Power Station to August 2025, seven years earlier than previously scheduled.
Origin’s announcement followed that of fellow energy retailer AGL that it would accelerate the closure of its two biggest coal-fired power plants – including the Bayswater power plant in the Hunter to “no later than” 2033, two years ahead of its previously scheduled closure of 2035, while the Liddell power plant, also in the Hunter, remains on track to close in April 2023.
The government has confirmed it will invest an extra $84 million in the key bodies needed to accelerate the implementation of its Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap and provide $47.5 million to accelerate the development of pumped hydro in the state. This funding is on top of the $380 million announced in the 2021 Budget to support the delivery of the Roadmap.
“We are also establishing a Transmission Acceleration Facility to accelerate the delivery of priority transmission projects and Renewable Energy Zones,” Kean said.
The first investment under the facility will be the Waratah Super Battery, a 700MW/1400MWh grid-scale network battery to be installed on the Central Coast.
The NSW government said it will work with industry partners to install the Waratah Super Battery, set to be the largest network standby battery in the Southern Hemisphere, by 2025 to release grid capacity.

BrightNight founder and chief executive Martin Hermann said the company specialises in hybrid renewable power systems with dispatchable capacity that can meet rapidly changing grid dynamics and increase grid resiliency, while remaining economically competitive with traditional forms of energy generation.
Hermann said while Australia has already witnessed impressive investment in renewable energy infrastructure, BrightNight will provide power off-takers with next generation hybrid, peak and firm power solutions that will outpace standard project dispatchability, reliability, and safety.
“As standard renewable energy solutions continue to energise, intermittent supply combined with growing demand will pose a threat to reliability and be increasingly challenging to manage,” the company said in a statement.
“In contrast, BrightNight renewable power solutions will provide operators with industry-leading dispatchability and energy management tools so clients can confidently decarbonize without compromising reliability.”
Hermann described the company’s expansion into Australia as “exciting but critical to the success of our customers who are working hard to meet electricity demands and navigate a transforming energy market”.
“We’re eager to be the reliable partner our customers need as they look for value beyond the limitations of a standard, intermittent, renewable energy project,” he said.
BrightNight’s track record includes several utility-scale solar and energy storage projects in the US, including the 400MW Eagle Shadow Mountain Solar Farm in Nevada.
As well as its US operations, BrightNight has a footprint in India, Bangladesh and South-East Asia.
The company’s move into the Australian market comes just weeks after independent fund manager Global Infrastructure Partners closed on a $500 million (AU$697 million) investment in the company.
BrightNight announced its entrance into Australia’s energy market with two key appointments. Former Lightsource BP development co-head Polly Baranco has been named head of country while former Macquarie Capital chairman John Walker has joined the advisory board.
“Beyond thrilled to announce that I have joined BrightNight as we embark on the next phase of the energy transition – dispatchable renewable power,” Baranco said in a social media post.

“The project was completed in under three weeks on site and brings the solar farm to 5.3MW in capacity and the site to 6.3MW in total solar capacity,” the company said in a social media post.
The new solar array, which is the latest expansion of the original 1MW solar installation that was commissioned in January 2020, features prefabricated, pre-wired Maverick solar modules designed by Sydney-based manufacturer 5B.
Nomadic said during construction that the rollout of the prefabricated modules had exceeded expectations.
“Pretty spectacular day up here. Almost 2MW down in nine days on site. The trucks can’t keep up,” the company said during the install.

Nomadic said the project is the first in Australia to use the latest generation of 5B’s re-deployable modular Maverick solar technology which the manufacturer said is not only quicker and easier to install than the previous model but 30% more powerful.
5B said its Maverick solution can be deployed up to 10 times faster and can generate up to twice the energy as conventional single axis tracker installations of comparable size using the same amount of land.
The latest install at the Carosue Dam mine site increases the total on-site solar capacity to 6.3MW as part of a six-year power purchase agreement (PPA) between Nomadic and Northern Star. It is anticipated the installed solar capacity will offset 6,686 tonnes of carbon emission per year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/03/state-opposition-taps-whyalla-to-host-593-million-green-hydrogen-plant/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 3, 2022",State opposition taps Whyalla to host $593 million green hydrogen plant,"South Australia (SA) Labor this week announced it will develop a massive green hydrogen power plant, including 250MWe of hydrogen electrolyser facilities, at Whyalla on the east coast of the Eyre Peninsula if it wins the state election to be held on 19 March.
SA Opposition leader Peter Malinauskas said on Wednesday a Labor government would build a 250MWe hydrogen electrolyser facility, a 200MW hydrogen-fuelled power station and storage capacity capable of holding 3,600 tonnes of hydrogen at Whyalla.
“A global transformation of the energy sector is underway. South Australia’s unique coincidence of wind and solar resources provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to lead in this transition,” he said.
‍Malinauskas said the electrolysers would use excess renewable energy to produce green hydrogen, reducing the need to remotely switch off rooftop solar for households and businesses, and would help unlock a $20 billion pipeline of renewable energy projects in the state.
The State Opposition has previously said the initiative, which would provide firming capacity in the state grid, will be operational by 2025.
The hydrogen project, which forms the centrepiece of Labor’s energy policy, was first flagged as an election promise in March last year but no location was revealed at the time.
The State Opposition said on Wednesday it had received a “comprehensive submission” from the City of Whyalla to host the project, with the area chosen due to its status as a “large industrial city” with a “highly trained workforce and service industry”.

Labor also touted the Eyre Peninsula town’s proximity to a deep-water port along with its air and rail infrastructure.
Malinauskas said Whyalla was “the perfect location for our Hydrogen Power Station, given its prime location, proximity to key infrastructure and diverse skills base”.
“South Australia already has a strong reputation for leading Australia and the world when it comes to renewable energy – and this is our next big leap forward,” he said.
Labor said if elected it would form an expert panel to report back within 90 days to identify the most appropriate parcel of land in the Whyalla and nearby Port Bonython area for the development.
The panel, including representatives from the local Indigenous community along with energy and infrastructure experts, will consider a range of factors in choosing a site, including access to adequate water and future export potential for excess hydrogen.
Whyalla Mayor Clare McLaughlin said the project could be “game-changing” for the city, diversifying the local economy and providing a more stable and secure future.
“Over the next decade, we believe Whyalla can be at the epicentre of global green hydrogen development, helping Australia achieve net-zero emissions by 2050,” she said.

The current South Australian government is also exploring green hydrogen opportunities in the region, announcing late last year it had shortlisted seven renewable hydrogen projects that combined could produce more than 1.5 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year as it looks to develop the proposed Port Bonython Hydrogen Hub.
The Port Bonython Hydrogen Hub, identified as a potential export hub for green hydrogen in SA’s Hydrogen Export Prospectus, assumes 2.3-6.5 GW renewable energy development to feed electrolysers of 1.2-2.5 GW.
McLaughlin said it was “welcoming and encouraging” that both sides of politics recognised the critical importance green hydrogen will play in the state and nation’s green future.
“With bipartisan support at both federal and state levels to establish Whyalla as a green hydrogen hub, council is looking forward to working with the parties that form government to make this vision a reality,” she said.

Construction of Australia’s Green Energy Manufacturing (GEM) Centre started yesterday in Gladstone, Queensland, according to the Fortescue Future Industries green hydrogen unit of Australian iron ore producer Fortescue. The company said the site would host the world’s largest electrolyser facility. “Stage one is the AU$114 million (US$83 million) electrolyser facility, which will be expanded as current demand indications crystallise,” said Fortescue. “The GEM has several growth stages already planned into its factory footprint, which includes green manufacturing technology such as cables, batteries, wind turbines and solar panels.” The company added, the electrolyser facility will have “an initial capacity of two gigawatts per annum – more than doubling current global production and enough to produce more than 200,000 tons of green hydrogen each year.” Fortescue wants to make 15 million tons of green hydrogen per year by 2030. The first electrolysers will be manufactured at the facility in early 2023. They will be used in Queensland at the company’s planned green-hydrogen-to-ammonia project on Gibson Island.
After completing a pre-feasibility study on the Pedirka Blue Hydrogen project in Australia’s Northern Territory, Hexagon Energy Materials has said Western Australia is the area offering the company the best opportunities for clean hydrogen production, and added, the use of ammonia as a hydrogen carrier is more commercially viable than liquid hydrogen. Nearby infrastructure such as ports and CO2 storage facilities are crucial elements to make projects commercially attractive. “Locating the hydrogen plant adjacent to feedstock supply is also critical to minimising raw material logistics costs and, as a result, commercial returns,” wrote Hexagon yesterday. “Low cost access to local process water supply and infrastructure impacts commercial returns.” The Australian company will announce more details of its hydrogen project in Western Australian in the coming week.
A research team in South Korea has synthesised metal nanoparticles it says can “drastically” improve the performance of hydrogen fuel cell catalysts. The Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) team synthesised nanoparticles by a physical method, rather than chemical reactions. The researchers used sputtering, a thin-metal-film deposition technology used in semiconductor manufacturing. “The KIST research team synthesised a platinum-cobalt-vanadium alloy nanoparticle catalyst using this technology and applied [it] for the oxygen reduction reaction in hydrogen fuel cell electrodes,” wrote the academics in a paper published in Nano Today. “As a result, the catalyst activity was seven and three times higher than [for] platinum, and platinum-cobalt alloy catalysts that are commercially used as catalysts for hydrogen fuel cells, respectively.”
Germany is opening its second hydrogen diplomacy office in Saudi Arabia.”The offices are tasked with providing expertise as well as analyses of the local and regional impact of the transformation,” the German Foreign Ministry wrote on Sunday. “Another key part of their role is to build ties between decision-makers, experts and companies from both countries. The offices are established in cooperation with [state-owned development entity] the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH and supplement existing energy partnerships.”
UK-based maritime classification society Lloyd’s Register has awarded approval-in-principle status to Norwegian shipping company Egil Ulvan Rederi for its zero-emission, self-discharging hydrogen-fuelled bulk carrier, With Orca. “The vessel is planned to enter into a long-term transport contract with cargo owners Felleskjøpet Agri and Heidelberg Cement,” Lloyd’s wrote today. The vessel will be powered by hydrogen, stored onboard in compressed form. “It will also have a fuel cell system for energy production in low load conditions,” said Lloyd’s. “A significant part of the energy required to operate the 88m/5,500 ton vessel will be harvested directly from the wind through two large rotor sails.” The craft, which is scheduled to enter operation in early 2024, will be able to store excess energy in batteries.
The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) has said renewable electrolysis needs policy and financial support to become economically viable. In the white paper published last week, the ICCT focused on the cost of renewable hydrogen produced at European refuelling stations. “Even our optimistic estimate of €6/kg hydrogen is significantly higher than the 2030 target of €1.80/kg announced by the president of the European Commission,” wrote ICCT’s Yuanrong Zhou and Stephanie Searle. They said the industry could advance down the price curve 10 years with a €3/kg hydrogen subsidy. “This subsidy amount can enable cost parity, from a fuel-cost perspective, of on-site electrolysis renewable hydrogen and diesel before 2030,” wrote the authors of the white paper.
Shell Global Solutions International has awarded Houston-based engineer KBR a contract to provide professional services for hydrogen liquefaction developments. “KBR will provide technical solutions as part of concept studies to advance technology for large scale hydrogen liquefaction – an alternative method for long distance renewable energy transport,” said Shell yesterday. “Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) also provides a versatile energy solution for a wide variety of end uses including mobility, power generation, [and] industrial and domestic heat as well as molecular end-use markets.”

Erthos is a company built on the concept of “solar simplified, from the ground up.” Its “earth-mount” solar arrays sit flat on the dirt, with no mounts or trackers below. It recently announced the closing of a US$17.5 million AU$24 million) Series B funding round to scale-up.
The company has an active project pipeline of over 2.5GW.
Prevailing utility-scale solar standards are to use single-axis trackers to increase production throughout the day. Erthos’ model disrupts this standard, instead opting to cut material and maintenance costs, and cut land costs by increasing panel density.
While this model may have been more challenging in the past, solar module prices have come down dramatically over the years. Erthos said at current prices, it is more cost-effective to buy additional solar modules to make up for the loss of efficiency from foregoing trackers.
Capricorn Investment Group, which is known for participation in the Tesla and SpaceX launch, led the Series B.
“We see in Erthos a unique opportunity where simplicity and speed to market is coupled with an enormous ability to effect change,” says Ion Yadigaroglu, partner at Capricorn. “Additionally, declining module prices, increasing steel prices, and rampant supply chain problems are creating enormous tailwinds for Erthos.”
The investment follows on a US$7.4 million (AU$10 million) Series A in 2019, which launched the company and helped it finalise the earth-mount system architecture. It also funded the development of the autonomous cleaning robot, which drives over the surface of the panels to clean them. The company has a 20-year operations, maintenance, and cleaning contract that warrants for less than 1% soiling through the term.
The company said it can install projects in half the time of utility-scale plants, at nearly half the cost, running under US$.50/W. Earth-mount solar requires 70% less cable, 70% less underground trenching, and very little water consumption, said Erthos.
The design eliminates the use of gaps between rows and the array is installed as a large, unified sheet, and Erthos said this allows their project to use one third the land area of a conventional utility scale solar design. Since the panels lay completely flat on the ground, Erthos says their projects are resistant to category-four hurricanes.
