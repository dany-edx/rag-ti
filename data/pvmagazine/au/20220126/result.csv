Canadian battery developer Zinc8 Energy Solutions is set to deploy its proprietary zinc-air battery technology at a New York apartment complex with a goal to demonstrate its long-duration energy storage capability. The project is developed in partnership with Digital Energy Corp, a New York-based private sector developer of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants, solar systems and microgrids.
The 100kW/1.5MWh zinc-air energy storage system (ZESS) will be installed at Fresh Meadows Community Apartments in Queens, New York, to support and enhance the economics of a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system currently under construction, along with an existing photovoltaic system.
Zinc8 Energy Solutions has developed a proprietary flow battery technology that it claims is able to deliver power in the range from 20kW to 50MW with a minimum storage of eight hours of capacity.
The modular battery can be configured to support a wide array of long-duration applications for microgrids and utilities, as well as for commercial and industrial projects. Unlike lithium-ion technology, which requires new stacks to scale, Zinc8 says it has completely decoupled the linkage between energy and power. This means that scaling Zinc8’s technology can be accomplished by simply increasing the size of the fuel tank and quantity of recharged zinc fuel.
The technology promises zero capacity fade over an extensive lifetime. According to the manufacturer, tt is non-flammable, non-toxic and sustainable with stable supply chains for mass production. It is also touted as a potentially hugely cost-effective solution, aiming for an installation cost of US$45/kWh (AU$63).
Zinc8’s system uses power from the grid or renewable energy sources to generate zinc particles in a zinc regenerator, thereby releasing oxygen as a by-product. The zinc particles flow then to the storage tank and are maintained there in a potassium hydroxide electrolyte. When power is needed, the zinc particles are delivered to the power stack and recombined with oxygen to generate electricity. The zinc oxide by-product is returned to the storage tank for later regeneration.
Zinc8 claims to have solved the dendrite issue, which leads to the clogging of the membranes used in flow batteries. The battery has a roundtrip efficiency ranging from 65% to 70%.
For its latest project at Fresh Meadows Apartments, Zinc8 tech has won financing from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). In this project, Zinc8 will be focused on advancing, developing and field testing its storage technology as it seeks to address cost, performance, and integration challenges in New York State. “This is an opportunity for Zinc8 to further develop a pipeline of projects and establish a foothold in the New York City market.” said Ron MacDonald, president and CEO of Zinc8 Energy Solutions.
Previously, Zinc8 signed an agreement with the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to deploy a 100 kW/1 MWh demonstration ZESS behind-the-meter at the University at Buffalo campus. The project was designed to provide peak shaving capability and improve campus resiliency, as well as explore alternative uses such as emergency backup for campus building. In addition, the Buffalo project aims to validate the system’s performance reliability and help to determine O&M and life-cycle costs.

Chinese inverter supplier Growatt has launched a residential, cobalt-free lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery for off-grid applications.
“The new AXE LV battery system covers a wide range of capacities extending from 5kWh to 400kWh, which caters to differentiated needs from daily households to large business and industrial scenarios,” said Lisa Zhang, marketing director for Growatt. “It supports power output of storage and off-grid systems, ranging from 3kW to 30kW.”
Each 5kWh module measures 650 mm x 350 mm x 165 mm and weighs in at 40 kg. The nominal voltage is 51.2V and the operating voltage range is between 48V and 57.6V. The battery also features IP20-rated protection and internal plus connection.
“The modularity of AXE LV battery system makes it easy to be installed with internal plugs, requiring no extra cable connections, while with all the external cables integrated onto one plug, its connection to the inverter is much more simplified,” the manufacturer said. “As a cobalt-free LFP battery, it stands out for its high-temperature resistance, strong safety and stability as well as better performance of up to 5,000 charge cycles.”
The company said the device has a lifespan of more than 10 years, and that it offers more advantages in terms of total cost of ownership than lead-acid batteries. It also comes with a five-year warranty.
“With regard to compatibility, AXE LV battery system can be used with all Growatt’s SPF off-grid series inverters. Moreover, it also works perfectly along with the SPH and SPA series storage inverters,” the company said.
Zhang noted that the company is now selling the batteries in the Americas and Asia, with additional plans to soon launch sales in other parts of the world, including the Middle East and Africa.

The hybrid plant’s power will, however, primarily be provided by a 11 MW natural gas component.
According to Calidus’s Managing Director, Dave Reeves, these gas-fired generators will be able to use up to 25% hydrogen, which – if green hydrogen were used – would further reduce the mining operation’s emissions, though little information has been given about this component of the project.
The combined 19 MW power station will be installed at Calidus’ Warrawoona mine site near Marble Bar in the Pilbara region with construction due to commence on the project in the second half of the year.
Zenith Energy will supply, install and commission the hybrid system for Calidus, entering into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the company. “The construction of the solar farm is part of the PPA whereby Calidus purchases power from Zenith,” Calidus’ Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) announcement on the news said. 
Red 5
Zenith has completed similar systems for Australian gold producer Red 5 at its King of the Hills mine in WA, as well as IGO Limited’s Nova Nickel-Copper-Cobalt Operation mine also in WA. 
Last year, Australian miner Northern Star Resources partnered with independent power provider Nomadic Energy to more than triple the capacity of the solar farm at its Carosue Dam gold mining operation near Kalgoorlie in Western Australia, adding a 3.3 MW re-deployable array to the existing 1 MW system. Major miners like BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue have also installed solar farms to power a number of their Australian operations.
Such systems are growing in popularity as mining sector in Australia tries to decarbonise. A study conducted by the Commonwealth Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources in 2020 found the mining industry is responsible for 4% to 7% of greenhouse-gas emissions globally.
Both companies, Zenith and Calidus, used images of a relocatable solar farm from 5B in their announcements. Though there is no specific mention of partnering with the popular company on the project, it may be an indication of their ambitions since the 5B Maverick solar array solution has been favoured for similar projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/26/sun-tax-scaffolding-unveiled-to-prevent-solar-households-getting-gouged/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 26, 2022",‘Sun tax’ scaffolding unveiled to prevent solar households getting gouged,"Last year, a rule change making it possible for electricity networks to charge solar households to export into the grid was met with acute criticism. Last week, when the Australian Energy Regulator released its draft guidelines on what enacting such a possibility might look like, the response was far more subdued.
The Australian Energy Regulator (AER), it seems, is eager to put a firm scaffolding around the rules to ensure that fears of networks gouging solar households will not be realised. 
It’s worth noting what has been released is draft guidelines only, with feedback and comment open until March 8, 2022. The final Export Tariff Guidelines are due to be published before July 1.
Importantly, Australians who already have solar systems on their roofs will not have export pricing introduced until 2025 at the earliest, with no customers able to be forced onto a tariff which includes charges for exports until 2035.
Any export tariffs must be approved by the AER. This will be done through the five-year tariff structure process, in which networks will have to convince the AER that two way pricing (the real name of what’s dubbed the “sun tax”) is necessary and will benefit customers.
Putting the onus on the networks, the AER says it was “not approve two-way pricing proposals unless” the distributor can demonstrate:
Proponents of the change argue that two-way pricing will allow for more DERs like rooftop solar, electric vehicles, and home batteries to be integrated into local networks because, essentially, what the tariffs try to do is change how – or more precisely when – households consume energy. The trick is to encourage self-consumption of solar power in the middle of the day and discourage exporting.
With rooftops in some parts of Australia quite literally covered to capacity, new solar customers are being subjected to ever lower export limits, with some even facing zero export limits. While this issues isn’t ubiquitous yet, it’s only getting worse with households installing record breaking amounts of solar each year. 
As Mark Byrne from the Total Environment Centre, one of the proponents of the change, wrote for pv magazine Australia last year, “doing nothing was never an option.”
“The flip side of networks charging to export at some times is that they would need to reward exports at other times – probably during the evening demand peak. Battery owners are the obvious, but not the only, winners here. Solar owners could also make money out of it if they can run more appliances during the day, face their panels east or west instead of north, or charge an electric car when the sun is shining,” Byrne wrote.
Critics of the change have worried networks will use two-way charging to leverage their monopolies and ultimately bill Australians helping the country decarbonise for the inconvenience integrating solar is for distributors.
The AER is trying to ensure this doesn’t happen, with its draft guidelines just a step in what will be a decades-long process.
Again, comment is open on the draft guidelines until March 8.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/26/huge-aluminium-demand-expected-in-solar-industry-concerns-arise-on-emissions/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,NEW SOUTH WALES,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 26, 2022","Huge aluminium demand expected in solar industry, concerns arise on emissions","From pv magazine Global
Owing to its high conductivity, low weight, and excellent corrosion resistance, aluminium is one of the key raw materials in the solar industry used in cells, module frames, mountings, and inverters. While abundant and cheap, the primary production of aluminium comes at a high cost in terms of energy and associated greenhouse gas emissions, which will need to be taken into consideration if we are to rapidly reduce emissions to ‘net zero’ and limit global warming to <2 °C.
A group of researchers at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) have sounded the alarm bell about the climate pressure aluminium could create if we were to solely rely on primary production by 2050. They found that the growth to 60TW of PV, envisaged by the broad electrification scenarios of recent photovoltaic roadmaps, could require up to 486 Mt of aluminium by 2050. This enormous manufacturing task could in turn create climate pressure due to its large global warming potential.
“If the emissions intensity of the primary production process is not reduced, then more than 3000 Mt CO2e could be released in the atmosphere,” researcher Alison Lennon, told pv magazine. “However, if we can decarbonise the electricity used to smelt aluminium, utilise as much secondary aluminium as possible and collect and re-use aluminium from old modules, then we can significantly curtail this global warming.”
To have more than 60TW of photovoltaics installed by 2050, up from just over 700GWp at the end of 2020, we would need to produce up to 4.5TW of additional capacity each year. The researchers assumed a primary production emissions intensity of 14.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide for each tonne of aluminium produced and considered various scenarios.
They found that without a substantial improvement to the emissions footprint of aluminium production, there could be almost four gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, under a worst-case scenario, the researchers say.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/26/australia-wide-solar-fit-out-means-concrete-progress-for-sustainable-construction/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"JANUARY 26, 2022",Australia-wide solar fit out means concrete progress for sustainable construction,"It is no secret that Australia has been experiencing a construction surge in recent years, no doubt aided by one of the biggest stimulus injections the housing industry has ever seen in the form of the Morrison government’s HomeBuilder program. 
However, as Victorian building materials and hardware business Bowens highlighted in their recent $1.2 million rooftop solar and sustainability investment, business owners have a responsibility to reduce their carbon footprints. According to Bowens, new home builds and renovations are up 33% since 2019 and Bowens chief investment officer, Andy Bowen, said “the world around us has seen a heightened focus on the environmental impacts of corporations and governments both big and small. It is our duty as an industry leader to play a positive role in this movement and do what we can – from recycling waste to reducing our power consumption.”
Humes, a division of Holcim and one of Australia’s biggest concrete suppliers, is following suit, announcing widespread solar installations across ten of its sites over the next two months. 
In a statement, Holcim said the “total annual capacity” of the combined solar systems across the 10 sites amounts to “1,100,000kW”. Since it is highly unlikely this figure is correct, it can be assumed the combined installation is expected to generate 1,100,000kWh annually. 
The various solar systems are set to be installed at Townsville, Rockhampton and Ipswich in Queensland, Tamworth and Blacktown in New South Wale, Laverton and Echuca in Victoria, Pooraka in South Australia, Darwin in the Northern Territory and Welshpool in Western Australia.

Humes reports that the installation at Pooraka is already complete and the local team is reporting regularly that it is producing more electricity that the facility consumes. 
“Our solar panels have been an excellent addition to the site,” said Jonathan Dunlop, Humes national manager of maintenance and mould, “benefiting both the environment and our bottom line.” 
Holcim has committed to reach net zero by 2050 for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, with a 90% reduction target for Scope 3 emissions.
“The building sector has an essential role to play to accelerate our world’s transition to net zero,” said Holcim CEO Jan Jenisch. “By setting the first Net-Zero Standard for our industry, we are committed to take science-driven action to win the race to net zero.”
