FFI confirmed the investment in a statement issued on Tuesday but did not disclose the sum. The transaction comes after the Australian company acquired a 60% stake in High Yield Energy Technologies (HyET) Group in October 2021. Thew group’s assets include HyET Solar and hydrogen technology specialist HyET Hydrogen.
FFI has identified HyET Solar’s lightweight Powerfoil solar technology as a key contributor as it looks to produce “millions of tons of cost-competitive green hydrogen by 2030, to support the sustainability targets of its parent company Fortescue and the worldwide energy transition”.
FFI, which plans to establish a 1GW Powerfoil manufacturing plant at Gladstone in Queensland, said by manufacturing the flexible solar modules and electrolysers at immense scale, it aims to drive down the cost of both products and hasten the delivery of affordable green energy to the world.
FFI, which was founded by iron ore magnate Andrew Forrest, has repeatedly declared it intends to build a global portfolio of renewable green hydrogen and green ammonia projects to produce 15 million tons per year of green hydrogen by 2030, rising to 50 million tons per year in the decade thereafter.

FFI chief executive officer Julie Shuttleworth said the company’s goal is to become the world’s leading, integrated, fully renewable energy and green products company.
“Fortescue Future Industries is focused on delivering 15 million tons per year of green hydrogen globally by 2030,” she said.
“We are working with HyET Solar to ensure we have the best and most efficient solar technology at our fingertips to generate the level of green hydrogen the world needs.
“Already we have a memorandum of understanding in place with E.ON to supply Germany with 5 million tons per annum by 2030. We invested in HyET in 2021 and we are already seeing growth in the value of this investment.”
HyET Solar founder and director Rombout Swanborn said the latest investments by FFI and Teslin would support the development of the company’s Dutch manufacturing plant and assist with the roll out of its business worldwide.
“HyET Solar has the ambition to manufacture at large scale very low-cost PV products offering innovative application possibilities,” he said.
“HyET Solar products are lightweight, flexible and based on thin-film silicon and perovskite technologies. With the investments of Teslin Participates and FFI, two powerful and complementary strategic partners, HyET Solar finds itself in a very attractive position to rapidly roll out its business worldwide.”
Swanborn said the Powerfoil technology is a lightweight, fully flexible, thin-film solar PV module suitable for high-volume markets such as utility scale solar farms as well as high-value markets such as building integrated PV. The company claims the ultra-low weight (0.6 kg/m2) and cheap materials used for its solar technology means it can be installed at a 30% reduction on the levelized cost of energy compared to traditional crystalline-silicon glass modules.
HyET said its Powerfoil technology will allow it to drastically reduce the cost of solar power and is targeting a cost structure for modules of $100k/MW.

FFI’s investment in HyET Solar comes just days after it inked a deal with New Zealand’s biggest gas pipelines operator, Firstgas, to investigate developing green hydrogen projects in that nation.
FFI announced on Monday it had signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding with Firstgas to identify opportunities to produce and distribute green hydrogen to tens of thousands of homes and businesses in New Zealand.
FFI and Firstgas will undertake feasibility studies to assess the technical, commercial and operational factors of any projects, which could include the possible use of existing energy assets.
Firstgas is New Zealand’s largest gas network with over 2,500km of high-pressure transmission pipelines and 4,800km of distribution pipelines in the North Island, connecting more than 300,000 homes and businesses to gas.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/04/plans-for-giant-green-hydrogen-project-in-wa-revealed/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 4, 2022",Plans for giant green hydrogen project in WA revealed,"The Murchison Hydrogen Renewables project being developed near the Western Australian coastal town of Kalbarri will use 5.2GW of wind and solar PV energy to produce renewable hydrogen which will be converted to an estimated 2 million tonnes of green ammonia per annum for domestic and export uses.
The ambitious project, set to be constructed on Murchison House Station about 20 kilometres north of Kalbarri on the state’s Mid-West coast, was first proposed by Hydrogen Renewables Australia in 2019. The project is now being led by Danish investment firm Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners through its offshoot Murchison Hydrogen Renewables (MHR).
While no specific details about the ambitious project were previously available, a referral filed this week with the state’s Environment Protection Authority (EPA) reveals the true scale of the project.
The submission shows MHR intends to install about 1.5GW of solar PV and an estimated 700 onshore wind turbines with a combined capacity of about 3.7GW.
A Power-to-X (PtX) plant will be constructed on-site to convert the renewable energy into green hydrogen which will be converted into an estimated two million tonnes of green ammonia annually.
The facility will be equipped with about 3GW of electrolysers while a purpose-built water treatment and desalination plant will generate about six giga-litres of “demineralised water” a year for use in the production process.

The PtX plant will be coupled with 250MW-350MW of battery storage with a two-hour duration that will be used to regulate the renewable energy prior to distribution to the electrolysers.
The proposal also includes hydrogen storage which will be used as an intermediary between electricity and ammonia. It is anticipated up to 200 hydrogen storage vessels, each with a capacity of up to 680 tonnes will be installed.
The green ammonia produced at the site is to be exported to emerging green energy markets with a pipeline to link the PtX plant and storage facility to a marine export facility. The submission also highlights the potential for local, domestic offtake as hydrogen or ammonia.
Hydrogen Renewables Australia has already secured a long-term agreement with the pastoral lessees of the Murchison House Station and announced Siemens as the proposed plant’s technology partner.
The project is expected to be developed in three stages. The first stage would comprise a demonstration phase producing hydrogen for transport fuels, to be followed by an expansion to blend with natural gas into the nearby Dampier to Bunbury pipeline.
The third and final phase would include an expansion to produce hydrogen for export to Asian markets.
Hydrogen Renewables Australia has previously indicated the potential for the proposed project to scale-up over a six-year period, reaching full capacity toward the end of this decade.
The referral to the EPA is currently open to public comment until May 8.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/04/victorian-big-battery-drives-major-revenue-jump-for-neoen/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 4, 2022",Victorian Big Battery drives major revenue jump for Neoen,"Renewable energy developer Neoen announced on Tuesday its revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was up a staggering 36%, a performance the French company said was largely attributable to the commissioning of the Victorian big battery which was switched on in December.
Neoen, which has established itself as a major player in Australia’s clean energy landscape, posted overall sales of $161.74 million (€109.1 million) for the quarter with storage revenue almost tripling from a year earlier. The company said higher power prices in Australia also helped to boost revenue across its wind and solar PV divisions, where sales rose by 23% and 31% respectively.
Neoen chairman and chief executive officer Xavier Barbaro said the commissioning of the Victorian Big Battery had played a major role in the strong quarter.
“With a capacity of 3.5GW in operation at end-March, up from 2.6GW one year ago, Neoen generated 1.5TWh of green electricity in the first quarter. Revenue was 36% higher than in the first quarter of 2021,” he said.
“This performance was driven by strong revenue growth at all three of our segments – solar, wind and storage, thanks in particular to the commissioning of the Victorian Big Battery, one of the world’s largest batteries.”
The 300MW/450MWh Victorian Big Battery was activated in December, less than a year after construction began and just six months after a fire destroyed two of the facility’s 212 Tesla Megapacks. Located near Geelong, the battery is one of the world’s largest with twice the capacity of Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia, also owned and operated by Neoen

Neoen, which generates the bulk of its power in Australia, added more than 2GW to its advanced pipeline during the first quarter, while assets in operation or under construction at the end of March were stable at 5.4GW.
The company said it remains on track to achieve it profit targets for this year and up to 2025, when it plans to have 10GW under construction or in operation.
“By the end of the quarter, our advanced project portfolio had expanded to more than 16GW with the addition of over 2GW in projects recorded as early-stage in 2021,” Barbaro said. “Given this portfolio and the unstinting efforts of our teams, we are more confident than ever in our future growth trajectory and are confirming all our targets for 2022 and by 2025.”
The revenue report comes just weeks after Neoen signed a seven-year agreement with energy giant AGL to provide 70MW/140MWh of ‘virtual battery capacity’ in New South Wales.
The first of its kind in Australia, the virtual battery offer will allow AGL to mimic a grid-scale battery, without having to build or own one.
Neoen plans to leverage its 100MW/200MWh Capital Battery being constructed in Canberra to provide the offering.
Neoen Australia managing director Louis de Sambucy said construction of the battery has already commenced and it is expected to begin operating in the first half of 2023.
“With the Capital Battery currently under construction, we will soon be operating grid-scale batteries in three of the five states of the National Electricity Market (NEM) and have multiple projects in development across Australia,” he said.

The IEC 61215- and IEC 61730-certified panel features 144 half-cells based on M10 wafers and a 10-busbar design. It has overall dimensions of 2,278 mm × 1,134 mm × 3.0 mm and weighs in at 32.5 kg, with the front and back glass layers measuring 2 mm thick.
The panel can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,500 V and an operating temperature between -40 C and 85 C. It comes with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee. The operating temperature coefficient is -0.349% per degree Celsius and its power tolerance reaches up to 5%, the manufacturer claims.
“Like all Sharp half-cell modules, the NB-JD540 has three small junction boxes instead of just one, each fitted with one bypass diode,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “These junction boxes are transferring less heat to the cells above and in turn boost the longevity of the panels and the overall performance of the system.”
The new product is purportedly resistant under extreme conditions, as it has passed tests for ammonia, salt mist, sand and potential induced degradation (PID) resistance.

India’s Enray Solutions has developed a self-powered, easy-to-use robot for water-free cleaning of ground-mount solar installations. The robot is built for harsh, dusty environments, and the company claims it can lead to a generation increase of up to 7% compared to periodic wet cleaning.
The robot doesn’t require any external power supply, as it is powered by an onboard monocrystalline solar panel and lithium battery with a control box. It is cloud-enabled and can sense weather to work accordingly.
An all-metallic body and aluminium components make the robot robust and lightweight at the same time. The industrial trolley-based design of the dock with height and tilt adjustment mechanism allows for the cleaning of multiple, misaligned arrays without lifting the robot. This eliminates the mishandling of the robot while shifting between arrays.
The robot easily travels without any rails and cleans itself while docking. A silicon coating on the wheels provides a cushion between it and the PV modules, preventing physical damage to the solar panels.
Cloud connectivity also allows the Enray team to centrally control and monitor the robot’s performance and update its software from time to time. The team has installed the robot for Indian clients such as Adani, NTPC, Tata Power, and Vikram Solar.

US microinverter manufacturer Enphase Energy has predicted the record revenue generated in the first three months of the year will be bettered in the current quarter.
The California-based company, which also manufactures batteries, posted revenue of US$441 million (AU$580 million) in the January-March window, up 7% from the US$413 million recorded in the final quarter of 2021. It said it expects US$490 million to US$520 million worth of business in the current trading period.
Those numbers translated into net income of US$51.8 million (AU$73 million), down from US$52.6 million in the previous quarter, with no obvious explanation offered in the first-quarter update published on the Enphase website. However, the company did add that its own, non-generally accepted accounting principle figure would have been US$110 million, helped along by the inclusion of US$47.8 million of stock-based compensation.
Enphase said it expects shift 130 MW to 140 MW of its IQ Batteries in the current quarter. It shipped around 2.84 million of its microinverters in the January-March period – down 6% on the previous quarter – for a total capacity of 1,029 MWdc, plus 120 MW worth of  IQ Batteries.
The company expects operating expenses in the current three-month period to rise to US$128 million to US$131 million (AU$180 – $185 million) because of a share incentive scheme and acquisition costs, which it expects will amount to US$57 million.
A slashing in net interest costs for Enphase, from US$12.7 million at the end of 2021 to US$2.74 million at the end of March, helped the company’s cash balance rise from US$119 million to US$252 million over the same period. At the same time, its non-current debts rose from US$952 million to US$1.2 billion, with the manufacturer having acquired business leads company SolarLeadFactory LLC in March.
