Spanish renewable energy company Acciona is using a robot dog to monitor the performance of a utility scale solar plant it is operating in the Desert of Atacama, in northern Chile.
Called Spot, the robot is being used as a replacement for drones, the company explained. “The maximum payload of a drone can be about five kg, while Spot can carry almost 15 kilos,” said Carlos Crespo, head of Acciona’s robotics and artificial intelligence group. He also explained that drones are able to move faster than Spot and, however, their batteries usually last only up to 30 minutes of autonomous operation, while the robot dog can operate for up to 90 minutes.
The device has a built-in thermal vision system that generates thermographic reports on the status of the different PV plant components, as it walks between the panel rows following a programmed route. According to the robot developer – US-based Boston Dynamics – the big benefit of the robot legs is that they are terrain-independent.
“A robot with legs has the most traversability, and it can be used regardless of the type of terrain at a given site. And Spot’s built-in, state-of-the-art navigation stack – all of the software and the hardware that the robot needs to get from point A to point B – is quickly making Spot the ‘go-to’ resource,” the company said in a statement.
Boston Dynamics sold its first robot dog in 2020 at a price of $74,500. It has been used so far by various industries for a wide variety of applications. Initially, Spot was used to inspect the construction works of active infrastructure tunnels, according to the US manufacturer.
Acciona decided to incorporate the quadrupedal robot into its operations in 2019.

While there is so much work going into developing new and existent battery chemistries and system designs, a pair of researchers from the University of California San Diego have proposed a new battery system that involves no physical device.
The team dubbed their concept information batteries, in which energy is stored in the form of information—specifically, the results of completed computational tasks. The idea is to speculatively perform computations in large, energy-intensive data centres when solar and wind energy is available in excess and stored the results on servers for later use, when there is less renewable energy on the grid.
In other words, information batteries would provide storage through speculative load shifting, anticipating computation that will be performed in the future.
The most likely candidates for implementing this concept are energy-hungry data centres – from Google and Facebook to Hollywood movie rendering. For instance, every day, YouTube data centres transcode more than 700,000 hours of videos to different resolutions and many of these computations are predictable and can be performed at a time when there is excess green energy.
In addition to taking advantage of task predictability, the system is also flexible: the computations that are completed in advance do not need to match exactly with the computations completed at a later time.
“We support pre-computing many fragments of computation and then later can pick and choose small pieces of computation done before, like puzzle pieces, and assemble them together to quickly compute a totally new computational task,” said Barath Raghavan, an assistant professor in computer science at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering.
While the idea itself is relatively simple, the challenge, said the researchers, is determining what computation to perform, where and when, and how these computations should be done to efficiently retrieve the results later.
In the paper Information Batteries: Storing Opportunity Power with Speculative Execution, the researchers describe their proof-of-concept implementation of information batteries, which includes recurrent neural networks for predicting the upcoming tasks in data centres, a cache where functions are stored enabling fast retrieval of precomputed results, and a modified compiler to automatically modify code to store and retrieve results.
However, as with all technologies, there are certain limitations to this concept. For instance, it is only possible in some workloads and in some contexts, which the researchers further explore in their study. But Raghavan believes with improved prediction and integration into large systems, the technology points towards a promising future alternative for storing green energy.
“In the civilisation-scale challenge of sustainability, we need every tool we can get,” he said.

Accurassi delivered the Energy Switch website allowing New South Wales energy consumers to change between traditional energy providers based on cost. It is now working on a modular Customer Acquisition and Management Platform for energy retailers with a focus on clean power.
“The technology we are building will allow energy retailers to diversify and evolve through the innovation of energy plans and billing capabilities,” Accurassi CEO Colin Fraser said. 
“It will empower customers to choose what they want, how they pay, and when they pay for it – things like bundled hardware, energy subscriptions and plans customised to an individual’s needs,” Fraser added.
1bill CEO Neil Saligrama says the investment “strategically aligned both companies” by combining 1bill’s market reach with Accurassi’s technology.
“No transition is easy, unless it’s made easy via technology, and that’s what this is about: using technology to simplify energy acquisition and management and provide clarity for consumers to make a smooth transition to sustainable solutions,” Saligrama said.

Neoen currently dominates Australia’s big battery landscape, with the 150MW/194MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve and now the 300MW/450MWh Victorian Big Battery. There are a number of other players though currently in the process of constructing battery storage projects, most notably in Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales, many of which are slated for completion this year.

In December 2020, analysts at Cornwall Insight Australia pegged Australia’s battery energy storage (BESS) pipeline at 7 GW. By the end of 2021, its research showed Australia’s pipeline of proposed storage had grown enormously to over 26 GW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/08/nine-policies-to-transform-australia/,"POLICY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 8, 2022",Nine policies to transform Australia,"Ahead of the federal election, industry peak body the Clean Energy Council has released its Roadmap for a Renewable Energy Future: Federal Election Policy Recommendations which outlines policy paths for the next federal government to deliver on Australia’s emission reduction commitments and realise the advantages of our natural renewable resources.
The Clean Energy Council’s vision was delivered in the form of a nine-point plan. I will go into more detail on the proposed policies, but as a taster each of the nine pathways could be summarised as:
In short, the plan seems to move in chronological priorities, promoting the internal delivery of an 100% renewable electricity grid within the decade, while then setting up the foundations to build hydrogen capacity primarily as an export industry in the longer term future.
The Clean Energy Council (CEC) estimates Australia will need to add at least 30 GW of solar and wind to replace coal generation by 2040. To power an ‘all-electric Australia’ – meaning switching household appliances, cars, industry etc to electric models – would require renewable energy production in Australia to increase 20 fold.

On the longer horizon, to turn Australia into a green hydrogen exporting superpower, CEC estimates the country would need another 700 GW of installed wind and solar capacity over the next 30 years.
This idea has been gaining traction recently, spurred by Australian Saul Griffith’s ‘Electrify Everything’ campaign. Basically, CEC’s main vision here is for the future federal government to set a clear target for Australia to be powered by clean energy by 2030.
It says an electricity grid powered by 100% renewable energy by 2030 will deliver emissions reductions based on 2005 levels of 44.5%. “This is just below the global average of 45% – it’s not an ambitious or difficult target – it’s the low-hanging fruit,” CEC Chief Executive Kane Thornton said.
Here CEC proposes setting a target for all suitable Australian buildings to have rooftop solar and a household battery by 2030. For customers where solar isn’t so appropriate, CEC wants to see the promotion of GreenPower –  a government accredited renewable energy product. 
CEC also wants to see a federal household battery program introduced. While similar programs have already been, or are in the process of being, rolled out in individual states, the council presumably wants to see a nation-wide approach similar to the Commonwealth solar scheme, the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme.
Quite self explanatory, CEC is calling for urgent funding for grid infrastructure upgrades, proposing a $20 billion fund to leverage private sector investment. This would surely be necessary to support all the solar its proposing on Australian rooftops (currently around one third of households have solar and its already causing major issues on low voltage grids). 
CEC wants Project EnergyConnect, HumeLink, Marinus Link and the Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone Transmission Link all prioritised. It noted that while there has been massive investment in clean energy projects over the past five years in Australia, but this investment has slowed dramatically since 2019 because of the inadequacy of Australia’s transmission network and significant barriers to grid connection.
The council is also wants to see reforms to the planning processes around energy storage as well as extra funding to support innovation in grid-forming inverters.
To ensure Australia has sufficient and well-trained people on the ground, CEC proposes establishing a workforce strategy task force which will include industry, governments, unions, regulators and training and research bodies.
It is also calling for a $200 million clean energy skills package that offers targeted support for training facilities to upskill regional workers in advance of critical transmission and renewable energy infrastructure development
At its heart, this point is about creating a just energy transition. To this end, CEC says a new authority should be established with “at least $1 billion funding to invest in transition initiatives in coal communities across Australia.”
The main point here is that Australia needs to accelerate its market reforms. The council also wants to see the nation recommit to the Australian Energy Market Agreement, a central agreement between all Australian state and federal governments, and redefine it to specifically include a commitment to transitioning to a decarbonised energy system. 
Here CEC proposes the federal government double its funding for clean energy research, development and demonstration to $200 million per annum.
To do this, the council proposes establishing a strategy ‘roadmap’ and fund to solve which industries will be better electrified and which could switch to hydrogen.
It also wants to see Australia set up a green steel flagship project to ensure that countries like Sweden, where green steel is already in production, don’t capture the emerging market.
Finally, the council wants to see a zero emissions target set for all forms of transport by 2050.
Primarily hydrogen oriented, this proposal appears to have some ideas which conflict with, for instance, the vision of electrifying Australia. For instance, CEC proposes establishing a 10%-15% Gas/Hydrogen Blending Target for gas distribution networks. 
This would work similarly to the Renewable Energy Target set by John Howard, which mandated electricity retailers procure an additional 2% of their energy from renewable sources by 2010. 
An Gas/Hydrogen Blending Target would place a requirement on gas networks to purchase a small and rising share of renewable gas/hydrogen for blending within their networks.
This topic is fairly contentious in Australia’s clean energy circles, with some staunchly against the idea. If Australia were to electrify, it also may prove fairly redundant. 
Aside from this proposal, CEC wants to see the federal government commit $5 billion to a Green Hydrogen Hubs Investment Fund, a massive expansion on the $315 million currently allocated for such projects.
CEC also wants to see a “Hydrogen Co-ordinator General” to oversee delivery of the the National Hydrogen Strategy, as well as the Commonwealth’s guarantee of origin schemes for hydrogen and its derivatives delivered within the year.

A Swedish-Finnish research group has conducted a comprehensive analysis of all storage options for large-scale compressed hydrogen, including storage vessels, geological storage, and other underground options.
They complemented their qualitative review with an assessment that considered a broad spectrum of technological advances for storing compressed gaseous hydrogen.
“Most of the technologies discussed in this study are immature and under development, which means that the research is still ongoing,” they said. “Furthermore, the infrastructure and facilities behind some of the technologies are massive, which would require significant resources and costs.”
They also noted that storage projects should be big enough to ensure low costs and profitability.
“The lesser the size, the more costly and unrealistic option it would be. Furthermore, geological nature and viability are crucial factors for some technologies,” they warned, in reference to the constraints of the geological options.
The scientists grouped storage vessels into four categories: pressure vessels made of metals like carbon steel and low-alloy steel, thick load-bearing metal liners based on steel or aluminium, thin metal liners with fibre resin composites, ultra-thin metal liners fully wrapped with fibre resin composites, and linerless fully composite pressure vessels based on fibre-reinforced shells.
The scientists noted the importance of different components such as valves, sensors, and storage containers for this kind of hydrogen storage. They also considered the most common fibre-reinforced composites used for hydrogen storage tanks, including carbon fibres, glass fibres, and glass fibres. They also looked at polyester, phenol, and epoxy resins for manufacturing pressure vessels. They said the latter are the best candidates due to their high mechanical properties and resistance to temperature and corrosion.
They also looked at seamless hydrogen storage vessels in hydrogen fuel stations and multifunctional layered stationary hydrogen storage vessels. The former can be cascaded in multi-vessel assemblies through valves and interconnection piping manifolds, leading to more hydrogen leak points. The latter are considered ideal for large-scale hydrogen storage operating at high pressure, without restrictions on size. The scientists also looked at steel-concrete composite pressure vessels and natural gas metallic vessels.
The Swedish-Finnish group assessed several options for geological hydrogen storage, including depleted oil and gas reservoirs, aquifers, salt caverns, abandoned mines, and rock caverns.
“The geological storage system typically includes injection and withdrawal wells and a confining layer. The injection and withdrawal wells are the devices responsible for getting the hydrogen in and out of the underground geological formations,” they said.
In addition, they assessed the viability of blending hydrogen into natural gas pipelines and underground methanation reactors.
“Despite the benefits of hydrogen injection into the natural gas network, there are also drawbacks that limit the amount of hydrogen (%) that can be injected. Hydrogen embrittlement is one of the main issues concerning pipelines safety and leaking risk,” the scientists said, in reference to the first of the two technologies.
They see the methanation reactors as a potentially good alternative, but they still have concerns about the methane production rate.
“The resulting methane then could be added to the natural gas network, which can provide one big storage that can be accessed by renewable sources that are close to the natural gas grid,” they said.
The academics said that they eventually want to conduct distance assessments for hydrogen transport, storage losses and all uses of stored hydrogen.
“The knowledge of these factors shall help the decision-makers to analyse and identify the tradeoffs among the different factors concerning the different technologies based on case by case requirements that can include specific technical parameters such as discharge or storage size,” they said.
They presented their findings in “Large-scale compressed hydrogen storage as part of renewable electricity storage systems,” which was recently published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. The research group includes academics from Sweden’s KTH Royal Institute of Technology and the Aalto University in Finland.
