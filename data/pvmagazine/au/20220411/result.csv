Presumably, each of the four ‘Future Science Platforms’ will receive $50 million, with the platforms spanning ‘Revolutionary Energy Storage Systems’ and ‘Permanent Carbon Locking’ as well as health. 
“Unlocking the secret to efficient and safe energy storage could see us charge electric vehicles as easily as we now fill our petrol tanks, or keep portable our devices charged for many days without the need for a top up,” Dr Adam Best, Interim Director of the Revolutionary Energy Storage Systems stream, said.
“On a larger scale, it could even be mimicking pumped hydro through new technology and making it more responsive to the needs of the grid.”
The storage stream’s intention is to reimagine Australia’s electricity grid to incorporate more sources of renewable power, “push[ing] the boundaries of existing research through collaboration with universities and industry,” the CSIRO said.
The agency will also be looking into carbon capture and carbon storage science, with Dr Andrew Lenton, Director of the Carbon Locking stream, saying atmospheric carbon removal will prove imperative to avoiding the worst impacts of climate change.
“CSIRO’s Future Science Platforms are a big part of our strategy to stay at the forefront of discovery,” CSIRO’s Chief Scientist Professor Bronwyn Fox said, noting the programs will bring together industry and science, including early career researchers.

The Mazda centre in Epping, in Melbourne’s north, now runs on 100% carbon neutral energy, after Real Utilities, the energy retailer arm of Frasers Property Australia, completed a new embedded energy network for the car company, including its solar system. 
The 37,235 square metre Mazda facility is conveniently owned and operated by Frasers Property Industrial, meaning the new energy infrastructure is internally managed.
The centre has reached the 100% mark through a combination of the renewable energy generated on site via the extensive solar PV array, as well as through certified renewable energy certificates and carbon offsets. This combination, Real Utilities said, has allowed it to “provide green power for the price of brown.” 
Frasers Property
“Real Utilities is in a unique position to be able to leverage our understanding of property and experience in development to provide a tailored carbon neutral energy solution suited to the specific needs of Mazda and the property itself,” says Paolo Bevilacqua, General Manager, Real Utilities.
Frasers Property Australia has been involved in a number of ambitious carbon-conscious building projects, including the landmark Burwood Brickworks shopping centre in Melbourne’s east. Owned by the company, the shopping centre is the first ever retail space to ever go after the Living Building Challenge Certification, the world’s most advanced measure of sustainability in the built environment.
Frasers has also been involved in a number of energy efficient homes trials, including building 51 net zero “Balanced Energy Homes” featuring solar PV, solar hot water, low-emissivity glazed windows, LED lighting, roof insulation at Ed.Square in south west Sydney. 
Frasers Property
Real Utilities, wholly owned by Frasers Australia, supplies energy to the company’s broad portfolio of properties, and well as externally, and its carbon neutral energy is certified by the Commonwealth government’s Climate Active program.
Last April, Real Utilities signed a seven-year renewable energy certificate purchase agreement with Origin, committing to buy 140,000 certificates per year from 2024 to 2030 to cover 100% of the projected electricity demands of its business and residential customers.

Often touted as a potential game-changing technology for accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), all-solid-state batteries boast an energy density approximately twice that of conventional lithium-ion batteries, significantly shorter charging times, and lower cost thanks to less expensive raw materials. While many Western legacy carmakers continue to invest heavily and forge partnerships with solid-state battery specialists, like QuantumScape or Prologium, to develop vehicles powered by this type of technology, Nissan has made key progress towards producing its own version of solid-state batteries for EVs. To keep all production in-house, the Japanese carmaker has unveiled its prototype manufacturing facility for laminated all-solid-state battery cells at its research centre in Kanagawa Prefecture. Under its Ambition 2030 vision, Nissan aims to launch an EV with all-solid-state batteries developed in-house by fiscal 2028. Its plan is to establish a pilot production line at its Yokohama Plant in fiscal 2024 to study materials, design, and manufacturing processes for prototype production. The maker of the world’s first mass-market EV, the Leaf, believes the cost of all-solid-state batteries can be reduced to US$75 per kWh in fiscal 2028 and to $65 per kWh thereafter, placing EVs at the same cost level as gasoline-powered vehicles.
When it comes to affordability of EVs, Japanese carmaker Honda and U.S. corporation General Motors have come together to “put people all over the world into EVs faster than either company could achieve on its own.” The two car manufacturers will codevelop a series of affordable EVs based on a new architecture using GM’s Ultium battery technology. The tie-up is expected to produce millions of EVs priced below $30,000, including popular compact crossover vehicles, beginning in 2027. GM is already working to accelerate new technologies like lithium-metal, silicon, and solid-state batteries, along with production methods that can be used to improve and update battery cell manufacturing processes. Meanwhile, Honda has established a demonstration line in Japan for all-solid-state batteries, which it sees as the core element of future EVs, and is making further progress toward mass-production. The two carmakers will also discuss future EV battery technology collaboration opportunities, to further drive down the cost of electrification, improve performance, and drive sustainability for future vehicles. “GM and Honda will share our best technology, design and manufacturing strategies to deliver affordable and desirable EVs on a global scale, including our key markets in North America, South America and China,” said Mary Barra, GM CEO. “This is a key step to deliver on our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality in our global products and operations by 2040 and eliminate tailpipe emissions from light-duty vehicles in the U.S. by 2035.”
Earlier this week, Barra herself, alongside Tesla’s Elon Musk and other automotive industry representatives, met with Biden administration senior officials to discuss EVs and charging infrastructure. The virtual meeting held on Wednesday yielded an agreement that the US EV charging network should offer an interoperable experience based on any car model. CEOs of Ford, Stellantis, Nissan Americas, Lucid and others also attended the meeting which discussed the US funding to “create a national network of 500,000 chargers.” Biden wants at least 50% of new vehicles by 2030 to be EVs or plug-in hybrids. In February, the administration rolled out a plan to award nearly $5 billion over five years to build thousands of EV charging stations every 50 miles (80km) along interstate highways, as part of a $7.5 billion funding package approved by Congress last year.
In Europe, EV batteries made by Mercedes-Benz will be given a new life in stationary energy storage systems. Swedish startup BatteryLoop said it will use batteries supplied by the German carmaker’s Mercedes-Benz Energy business line for its range of scalable, circular energy storage solutions, called BLESS. This could enable BatteryLoop to roll out 40MWh of energy storage systems within the next 18 months. The first project using Mercedes-Benz Energy’s modules will be a 2MWh system that the start-up, part of Swedish recycling company Stena Metall Group, will install in its home country. BatteryLoop said it will secure “high volumes” of batteries, both new and second life, through the deal. “With second-use batteries and a power-optimising system we can also, based on the Swedish environmental research institute lifecycle analysis, save 1,000-tonnes CO2 emissions per 3MW energy storage system from the production and at the same time generate the same benefits for the grid,” BatteryLoop CEO Rasmus Bergström said, adding that such systems can generate significant revenues for customers of between SEK7 million (US$0.75 million) to SEK10 million per year.
This week, Mercedes-Benz revealed that its EV sales are going through the roof. The carmaker said the sales of its EVs and plug-in hybrids has increased by 37% to 67,800 units in the first quarter of 2022. Sales of the fully electric EQ models more than tripled to 21,900 (up by 210% compared to Q1 2021). “Ongoing strong demand for our electrified vehicles in all segments and markets proves that customers desire our EVs und plug-in hybrids. And with the launch of our new EQS SUV on April 19th we further accelerate our transformation,” said Britta Seeger, Member of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG responsible for Mercedes-Benz Cars Sales. Thereby, the Stuttgart-headquartered luxury carmaker seems to have outperformed its Munich-based rival BMW, which saw an increase of 149.2% in global sales of its all-electric BMW and Mini vehicles. However, BMW delivered a greater number of all-electric vehicles – a total of 35,289 between January and March.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/11/how-climate-friendly-is-an-electric-car-it-all-comes-down-to-where-you-live/,"EV,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",,"APRIL 11, 2022",How climate-friendly is an electric car? It all comes down to where you live,"From the Conversation
New research reveals having an electric vehicle would mean less emissions than a fossil-fuelled car – but the extent to which electric vehicles can lower emissions varies in each state. Much depends on how much electricity is generated from renewable sources, such as solar, wind and hydro.
Australia-wide, the study found electric vehicles emit, on average, 29-41% less emissions than a typical fossil-fuelled car for every kilometre driven. But when you break it down into states, Tasmania is expected to see the largest drop, with 70-77% less emissions per kilometre.
This information is important for meeting climate targets, because Australia’s on-road fleet is different from the more commonly assessed fleets in the United States, Europe or Asia in terms of vehicle size, fuel type, emission standards and fuel quality.
Australia won’t meet its climate target of net-zero emissions by 2050 without an overhaul of transport, as the sector accounts for around 17% of national emissions. Passenger cars alone account for around half of all our transport emissions.
Rising petrol prices might just be the incentive we need to swing public sentiment towards electric vehicles in Australia, which have a lower climate footprint.
In just two years, electric vehicle sales have tripled from 6,900 in 2020 to 20,665 in 2021. And yet, they still account for only 2% of market share in new cars.
This is a far cry from the rest of the world, where 6.6 million electric vehicles were sold globally last year. Over half were in China alone.
Thanks to a range of financial incentives, Canberrans led Austalia in the number of electric vehicles bought per capita. Motorists bought 825 new electric vehicles last year, accounting for over 5% of all vehicle sales in the territory.
Queensland, too, may see a surge in uptake, as last month the Palaszczuk Government announced a A$55 million electric vehicle package, which includes a $3,000 incentive to buy a car and $10 million for new charging infrastructure.
To compare the potential for emissions reduction in each state, Transport Energy/Emission Research (TER) conducted a so-called “life cycle assessment”. This considers all aspects of a vehicle’s life – from production, to operational use (driving it), to when it gets scrapped.
Life cycle assessments are a holistic way of looking at emissions but, confusingly, some studies have reached different conclusions. So TER combined a life cycle assessment with a probabilistic analysis, presenting our findings as a range of possible, but realistic, outcomes.
The average carbon emissions for a fossil-fuelled Australian car are an estimated 349-390 grams per kilometre. This is made up of approximately:
An average battery electric car, on the other hand, is estimated to have life cycle emissions around 221-255 grams per kilometre. This is made up of approximately:
Infrastructure and vehicle disposal (scrappage) is estimated to have less than 1% contribution for both vehicle types.
These estimates are higher than what has been reported in European studies, reflecting Australia’s unique conditions, including high carbon intensity from coal-based electricity generation, and different fleet characteristics such as having heavier and larger cars than Europe.
The good news is, in all Australian jurisdictions, emissions released from the beginning to the end of the electric vehicle’s life are expected to be significantly less than for fossil-fuelled cars. Each, however, varies in the extent emissions will be reduced.
The largest emissions reductions will occur in Tasmania, as its electricity largely comes from renewable sources: more than 80% comes from hydroelectricity and about 10% comes from wind.
South Australia comes in second, with electric vehicles bringing 55-66% less emissions per kilometre, compared to fossil-fuelled cars. This is because a significant portion of SA’s electricity comes from wind (about 40%) and solar (more than 10%).
At the other end of the spectrum, most electricity generation in Victoria and New South Wales currently comes from coal-fired power stations.
And still, electric vehicle uptake is expected to see substantial reductions: around 9-31% in Victoria, and 17-39% in NSW. These values will improve as the electricity generation system is further decarbonised.
Australia has a huge potential for a renewables industry, thanks to our wide open spaces, windy coasts and sunny skies.
So TER also looked at a future scenario, where the national electricity mix is generated with about 10% fossil fuels and 90% renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro, biomass). In this scenario, electric vehicles nationwide are expected to provide between 74% and 80% emissions reductions.
Sadly, Australia is still far removed from this situation. Most cars sold in 2020 were large fossil-fuelled SUVs with high greenhouse gas emissions because of their size and weight.
What’s more, fleet turnover is a slow process. The Australian Motor Vehicle Census reports that the average age of Australian cars is about ten years, with an average attrition rate of only about 4% each year.
This means even if all passenger vehicles sold today were electric, it would take more than ten years for the Australian road fleet to be fully electric.
Efforts to boost the share of electric vehicles in the Australian fleet needs to be stepped up urgently, alongside a rapid decarbonisation of the electricity grid. These should, finally, align with international emission standards to reduce delays and increase choice and availability of electric vehicles in Australia.
This will ensure we’ll have at least made a significant start with emission reductions in the road transport sector by 2030.
If Australia was serious about reducing emissions – fast – rolling out electric vehicles could perhaps focus on states with the lowest carbon intensity. But given the slow fleet turnover and the current state of play, it’s essential electrification starts everywhere, now.

Germany’s Bosch has developed a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system for commercial and industrial applications and is preparing a production ramp-up in 2024. The SOFC system can run on natural gas, biomethane, hydrogen or different blendings, with an electrical efficiency of more than 60% and an overall efficiency of more than 85%.
“Our SOFC system is primarily used to produce electrical energy but can also produce thermal energy at temperature levels that can be used for heating or cooling,” Marcus Spickermann, senior vice president of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) at Bosch, told pv magazine. “We are running several pilot projects at the moment, and we are preparing for the market entry in 2024, when we will start with an annual production volume of 200 MW per year.”
The current prototype machines have a target power output of 10 kW electricity supply. They also produce up to 3 kW of thermal energy.
“We are currently planning to increase the capacity of the system, as our plan is to offer the device mainly in the commercial and industrial segment,” Spickermann said.
The modular SOFC units can be combined to a cascade or cluster that forms a decentral energy supply system and are designed as connected devices that are part of the Internet of Things. In the future, it will be possible to connect SOFC clusters to virtual power plants that reach high power capacities in the megawatt range.
“When these machines are linked together, and the power grid fails, their resilience has a value that many investors may be happy to recognise,” Wayne-Daniel Kern, vice president of SOFC at Bosch, told pv magazine.
The fuel cell unit also produces thermal energy at temperature levels that can be used for heating or cooling.
“The heat coming out of the system has a temperature of around 200 Celsius degrees, an optimal level to reutilise it to heat buildings or reconvert it into cooling for use cases in data centres,” Kern said. “This heat can be an efficient add-on supply to a building’s existing heat supply system. The machines are primarily intended at producing electricity, but making use of the heat supply helps reduce the costs of ownership.”
When commercial production is launched, the product may have a payback time of between five and six years, so by that time it will become very attractive, said Kern. Bosch aims to produce the fuel cell units on a large scale.
“We are not targeting a niche market, we are a mass manufacturing company,” Kern said. “We know how to industrialise and produce thousands of machines.”
In Germany, Bosch already operates around 50 SOFC pilot installations at its own sites in Bamberg, Homburg, Renningen, Salzgitter, Schwieberdingen, Stuttgart-Feuerbach, and Wernau. Its first pilots are running at customer locations such as Stadtwerke Bamberg. This SOFC unit supplies power to the surrounding area and the heat is used at a nearby bakery.
In preparation of the production ramp-up in 2024, further pilot projects will follow in order to prove the capabilities of the SOFC units. The company will develop a series of products that meet custom requirements in different use scenarios such as buildings, industrial applications, distributed energy supply systems (microgrids), and data centres.
