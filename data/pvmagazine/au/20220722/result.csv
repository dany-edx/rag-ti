“We found with the second prototype that we just finished installing in the Southern Highlands that we’re cracking three times faster installation compared with an in-situ system,” he said. “If you’re deploying it three times faster than an in-situ installation, there is quite a good labour saving in there which we are passing on to the client.
“The labour component is typically 40% of the turnkey costs of the system so it translates to about a 20% cost saving on labour.”
Canyon’s modular solar shade structure is built around individual pods, each measuring 7.5m long and 2.6m wide with two pods combined to create a single unit which covers three car park bays. The units can be deployed in series to give shelter to hundreds of vehicles, the manufacturer said.
Each individual pod houses six 660 W bifacial panels from Canadian Solar coupled with multi-string inverters from Sungrow but the structure is designed to easily incorporate components from other manufacturers. The waterproof system can be grid-connected, linked to storage and seamlessly integrates with electric vehicle charging hardware.

The pods and steel support structures are pre-assembled in the factory and delivered to site where the pods are lifted into place atop the prefabricated  columns and rafters. Final electrical connections are completed before the system is commissioned.
“Basically 80% of the work is done before arriving at site,” Beaumont said. “All the modules on the pods are already installed, they’re wired, the waterproofing system is actually incorporated into the module mounting system so that is already done as well.
“The idea is when you go to install it, all you’re doing is erecting the columns and the rafters are attached to that. You are then basically just using a forklift or a telehandler to lift the pods into place and finishing off the final connections.”
Beaumont, who established Canyon Solar after time spent with C&I solar heavyweight Solgen Energy, said the modular shade structures provide a cost-effective alternative to traditional cloth or membrane-based shade structures and rooftop solar PV installs.

“If you’re trying to sell solar just on solar, carpark systems don’t make sense because there’s a lot of extra costs in terms of the foundations, the support structure, all those components,” he said. “But when you look at what a traditional shade cloth costs and what rooftop solar PV costs, which is usually $1.20 per watt, when you combine those two budgets, our solar shade structure actually costs less.
“When you subtract what a normal shade structure will cost, our effective solar costs is usually between $1.10 and 1.20 per watt.
“If you are already considering putting shade in the car park, solar shade is actually better than rooftop solar in many cases. And that is from a dollar-per-watt perspective.”
Canyon Solar is yet to secure its first commercial project but Beaumont said the company is in negotiations with “a number of shopping centres and universities” with the first of the installations expected to be completed before the end of the year.
“I’m very optimistic that modular solar shade structures will become a big part of the future solar industry,” he said. “We’ve now hit the point where it is commercially better to install a solar shade structure than a traditional membrane-based shade cloth in most commercial carparks.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/22/bowen-discards-planned-changes-to-arena-mandate/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 22, 2022",Bowen discards planned changes to ARENA mandate,"Energy Minister Chris Bowen has moved to repeal changes put in place by the former government and install a new set of regulations that he said would ensure the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) is focused on funding renewable energy and technology that supported it.
“ARENA has a crucial role to play to support Australia’s energy transformation,” he said. “But they are hampered in their efforts by three separate attempts to broaden ARENA’s mandate by regulation so it could fund non-renewable technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) and blue hydrogen.
“I’ve signed regulations which make it clear that ARENA will focus on renewables and electrification.”
The agency will also be given an additional targeted mandate to maximise the take-up of renewable energy, helping boost the level of renewable generation in the National Electricity Market (NEM) from about 30% today to 82% by 2030.
“These regulatory changes will help ARENA work with industry on accelerating electrification as well as increasing energy efficiency that will support the overall transition to renewables,” Bowen said.
“Decarbonisation of the economy will require large-scale electrification, which may not be exclusively powered by renewables initially, but will draw increasingly on renewable energy over time.”
The introduction of the new regulations follows Labor’s pre-election commitment to grow renewable capacity to 82% of all NEM generation by the end of the decade. Labor’s approach centres on a $20 billion government intervention to fast-track upgrades to the national electricity grid to accommodate the influx of renewable energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/22/esb-drives-discussion-on-integration-of-ev-smart-charging/,"EV,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 22, 2022",ESB drives discussion on integration of EV smart charging,"Australia’s Energy Security Board (ESB) released an issues paper on Thursday seeking feedback from industry and stakeholders to develop policy advice on the technical foundations necessary to support the effective integration of smart charging for electric vehicles (EVs) into the National Electricity Market (NEM).
The ESB’s Electric Vehicle Smart Charging Issues Paper is seeking input from stakeholders on a range of issues relating to the development of effective arrangements for EV smart charging in both domestic and public settings.
The establishment of standards to support the effective integration of charging devices for EVs was identified as a priority activity as part of ESB’s delivery of the broader DER Implementation plan, which is seeking to maximise the benefits of the continued rapid uptake of distributed energy resources including rooftop solar and battery storage.
“Australia is in the midst of a fast-paced transition,” the paper says. “Changes in how households, businesses and communities generate and consume energy are underway at both the large and small scale and require a reimagining of how consumer energy outcomes are met.”
The ESB said given the potential energy implications of a significant increase in EVs, it is also “relevant to consider how settings may be introduced in ways that can support and encourage convenient and efficient charging behaviour as well as drive efficient investment decisions”.
EV uptake in Australia has been slower than in offshore markets but the rollout of plug-in zero emissions vehicles is projected to grow substantially in the next few years. In 2021, EV sales in Australia totalled 20,665, a three-fold increase on the 6,900 EVs sold in 2020 and the growth is expected to accelerate.
Projections published by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AMEO) in its 2022 Integrated System Plan suggests that EVs will comprise 58% of the national fleet by 2040. This would account for approximately 37 TWh of electricity demand.

The ESB said this growth has implications for planning and forecasting of energy demand across the NEM, and in particular for the potential impact on future peak demand requirements.
“The projected increase in EV ownership and eventual transition to a full EV fleet will be transformative on the energy supply chain,” it said. “Planning for the transition and that longer-term future must commence today.”
The ESB said while Australian motorists have been slow to purchase EVs, that fact represents an opportunity to learn from international experience and adapt what might work best in an Australian context.
The ESB is seeking feedback from industry and stakeholders on a broad range of issues relating to the development of effective arrangements for EV smart charging in both domestic and public settings.
This includes equipment standards and alignment across jurisdictions; interoperability standards for both residential and public environments; and policy settings that allow for the growth of private investment in public charging. The ESB is also seeking feedback on cybersecurity issues; remotely managed smart charging capabilities; technology specific tariffs; and charge-point pricing.
Feedback to the Issues Paper must be submitted by 19 August 2022. It will then be used to support the development of draft directions and advice to government relating to the adoption of minimum standards for EV smart charging.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/22/ja-solar-test-reveals-n-type-panels-outperform-p-type-counterparts/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 22, 2022",JA Solar test reveals n-type panels outperform p-type counterparts,"JA Solar has concluded one year of tests to compare its n-type and p-type bifacial PERC solar modules at a testing field located at China’s National Center of Supervision and Inspection on Solar Photovoltaic Product Quality (CPVT) in Yinchuan, in the Ningxia Hui region.
The company conducted the tests between February 2021 and February 2022. The results were confirmed by Germany’s TÜV Nord. The testing location has an annual average temperature of 8 C and an annual average solar radiation of 2,800 to 3,000 hours with a solar spectrum very close to the standard illumination conditions (AM1.5).
The testing field comprised a 6 kW unit equipped with n-type panels and a 6 kW unit relying on p-type products, with an inverter of 20 kW being connected to both sets. The panels were installed on fixed structures with a tilt angle of 40 degrees and at a height of 1 meter above the ground.
The company measured the performance of the array via an environmental monitoring system, a double-sided irradiance meter, a high-precision DC meter, and a temperature sensor. It exclusively used data from the DC meter for the assessment.
JA Solar found that the daily average energy yield of the n-type and p-type panels was 5.03 kWh/kW and 4.84 kWh/kW, respectively, which means n-type modules had a 3.9% higher energy yield compared to their counterparts.
“While both types of modules are based on half-cut bifacial solar cells, the energy yield difference is mainly due to cell technology performance,” said the manufacturer.
The company said the n-type modules operated at an average temperature that was 1 C lower than that of the p-type panels, by virtue of their lower temperature coefficient of -0.3% per degree Celsius, which compares to -0.35% per degree Celsius for the p-type products.
“The n-type module has 80% bifaciality which is much higher than the 70% of PERC modules,” the company said. “Assuming irradiance under the rear side is 100 W/m2 to 150 W/m2 condition, the 10% bifaciality difference can bring n-type module energy gain 1%~1.5%, when the albedo is 20%~30%. The PVsyst simulation shows 0.8%~1.2% more power generation can be seen due to this factor.”
JA Solar released its first line of solar modules based on n-type wafers in May.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/22/transgrid-delivers-235-million-powering-sydneys-future-project/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 22, 2022",Transgrid delivers $235 million Powering Sydney’s Future project,"Transmission network owner Transgrid announced on Thursday it has completed the $235 million Powering Sydney’s Future project which it said will secure electricity supply to the Sydney CBD and surrounding areas for decades to come.
The project involved the installation of a 20-kilometre 330kV underground cable from Potts Hill in Sydney’s southwest to the inner-city suburb of Alexandria. Substations at Potts Hill, Alexandria and Picnic Point were also upgraded while additional conduits were installed along the cable route to allow for a second cable to be added in the future as demand increases.
Sydney’s CBD and surrounding areas were previously serviced by electricity cables installed more than 50 years ago and were reaching the end of their serviceable life.
Transgrid chief executive officer Brett Redman said the Powering Sydney’s Future project, which commenced in 2020, is the largest 300kV cable project yet delivered in Australia.
“This is the culmination of many years of planning, design and construction and will ensure a reliable electricity supply to more than 800,000 residents and the critical businesses and infrastructure helping to power the nation’s largest economy,” he said.

Redman said the project, which was fast tracked by the NSW government in response to growing peak electricity demand, driven largely by new infrastructure investment and population growth, had been delivered “on time and under budget”.
The Powering Sydney’s Future project is one of a suite of major electricity transmission projects being undertaken by Transgrid and Redman said it would inform other projects considered vital as Australia’s transition to renewable energy generation continues to accelerate.
“The recent instability we’ve seen in the energy sector highlights the crucial role transmission and projects like this play in enabling Australia’s energy transition,” he said. “We’ve learned many positive lessons from this project and will leverage this success by taking those lessons into our other major projects including EnergyConnect, VNI West and HumeLink.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/22/heat-wave-sparks-fire-at-solar-park-in-the-netherlands/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 22, 2022",Heat wave sparks fire at solar park in the Netherlands,"From pv magazine Global
A heat wave that brought this week record temperatures to Europe is reportedly the cause of a fire that started on Tuesday at a solar park owned by UK energy company Shell and located in Sas van Gent, in the Dutch province of Zeeland.
“For an unknown reason, the grass around the solar park caught fire,” the municipality’s fire department said in a statement. “The dry grass and the strong wind contributed to increasing the fire, which burnt a large area.”
According to Zealand’s safety agency Zeeland Veilig, the fire brigade was able to control the fire, which hit an area of around 5,000 square meters, in around two hours. “The fire burnt the grass under the panels and the solar panels were not affected,” the agency said.
The 30 MW Zonnepark Sas van Gent-Zuid solar facility is owned by UK energy company Shell and occupies a surface of 24.2 hectares on an unused industrial surface.
“Hidden from view, involvement of local residents in the construction, located on former industrial lands that can no longer be used for agriculture and in a place where animals can go about their business; that’s how every solar park should be,” Shell said in a statement released in March. “Moreover, the large pond in the center of the park remains untouched, to give plants and animal species the space they will need. The management of the wood girths around the park will get extra attention, as bird life will be taken into account.”
