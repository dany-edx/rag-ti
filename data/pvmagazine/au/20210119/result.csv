Filed by global infrastructure firm AECOM on behalf on Sydney-based developer Genex Power Limited, the system is being proposed in the rural town Bouldercombe, just over 20km south of Rockhampton.
The system will be composed of rechargeable lithium-ion battery modules in an enclosure with integrated bi-directional power conversion, local media outlet the Morning Bulletin reports. Genex plans to co-locate the storage facility on Powerlink’s Bouldercombe Substation on the Burnett Highway, according to the media outlet.
AECOM was not yet able to share details of the proposal with pv magazine Australia however, nor has Genex Power Limited issued a press release on the plan.
According to the the Morning Bulletin, the development application cites studies showing upgrades to transmission infrastructure in the National Electricity Market are required to cope with the variable nature of wind and solar power, posing the project as key to responding to the challenge.
Australia’s notoriously rickety grid is one of the major hurdles the country faces in its renewable energy transition, but companies are have been seeking to plug the hole with energy storage project proposals. Barely a fortnight in and 2021 has seen a slew of battery announcements, including Origin Energy’s plans for a 700 MW megabattey in NSW’s Hunter region as well as Neoen’s 500 MW battery planned west of Sydney. Australia’s largest power producer, AGL, also remains on track to add at least 850 MW of new large-scale battery storage to its portfolio by 2024.
Genex Power’s application is awaiting development approval and is expected to be made public soon.

The announcement marks the first allocation from the state government’s $19 million Clean Energy Future Fund, which has been criticised for drawing its royalties from ‘unconventional onshore oil and gas projects,’ a euphemism for fracking.
With its grant from WA’s Future Fund, Nomadic Energy will install 5 MW worth of modular, re-deployable solar panels at Saracen’s Carosue Dam gold mine. “The flexibility to redeploy the solar panels removes a key barrier to using green energy at mine sites, where a mine may cease operating before the cost of the solar panels has been recovered,” the government said in its statement.
ResourcesWA will install 30 MW of solar power at its Homestead mine site in the Goldfields, supplying power to the Paddington Mill and Mungari Mill sites. It will also install 10 MW and 5 MW batteries at each of the mills respectively, both with one hour of storage. The intention is to reduce the impact of outages and support Western Power’s local substation.
Combined, the installations are expected to generate 77,000 MWh of electricity each year.
“Nomadic Energy and ResourceWA were chosen for the high value they provide, their capacity to reduce emissions, potential for wider adoption, innovation and financial viability,” Environment Minister, Stephen Dawson, said.
Where projects to reduce the emissions at facilities in regional areas were prioritised in the first round of grants, with the state government funding up to 25% of eligible project costs, the second round of grants will “prioritise clean energy projects that reduce emissions, create jobs, improve security and reliability of supply, or support the replacement of diesel use.” Applications for round 2 of the Clean Energy Future Fund will open on Monday January 25, with a total of up to $16 million available in the fund.
The Clean Energy Future Fund, launched in April 2020, is part of the state’s net zero by 2050 target as well as its Covid-19 economic recovery plan. Over the life of the two projects funded by the grants, around 365 construction jobs and 22 ongoing jobs are expected to be created.
“With over 385 construction and operational jobs expected to be created during the life of the two projects, it’s clear that clean energy industries are an important source of future employment opportunities, particularly in regional WA,” Energy Minister, Bill Johnston, said in a statement.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/19/bidens-senate-majority-doesnt-just-super-charge-us-climate-action-it-blazes-a-trail-for-australia/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",,"JANUARY 19, 2021","Biden’s Senate majority doesn’t just super-charge US climate action, it blazes a trail for Australia","From The Conversation Australia. 
Earlier this month, somewhat overshadowed by the events in Washington, the Democrats took control of the US Senate. The Democrats now hold a small majority in both the House and the Senate until 2022, giving President-elect Joe Biden a better chance of getting climate actions through Congress.
Biden’s key nominees to environment and climate positions in his administration must be approved by the Senate, and the Democrat majority provides a clearer path for this.
Now we have a better picture of the climate-engaged Biden administration, the question for Australia is how the changes will affect our domestic climate politics.
An aggressive US climate policy rollout could provide a much needed dose of reality to the climate discourse in Canberra. It may also prompt Australia’s major parties to acknowledge the inevitability of a transition to a zero carbon economy.
Biden’s climate-fighting team
The nominees for Biden’s climate team are both well qualified and set new benchmarks for diversity. The initial response to the picks has been positive, both from the US climate activist community and more mainstream Democrats.
Congressional representative Deb Haaland will become the first Native American to serve as Secretary of the Interior. Michael Regan, currently head of North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality, will be the first African American to head the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Biden also tapped several Obama alumni for key climate roles. The most notable is perhaps former EPA head Gina McCarthy, who will fill a newly created role as White House national climate advisor.
Former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm is nominated as Secretary of Energy, and former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg will lead the Department of Transport. Former Secretary of State John Kerry’s appointment as US Presidential Special Envoy on Climate was announced in late November.
The team will be charged with delivering Biden’s ambitious climate platform, which includes:
What this means for Australia
Beyond simply rejoining Paris, one suspects Biden will want Kerry to reclaim the US’ leadership role in the global quest for zero carbon. This will create a challenge for Australia.
Our Paris targets are modest at best. However in recent years, Trump’s antagonistic position on climate action meant the US absorbed the bulk of international criticism. The Biden win means Australia’s perceived lack of climate ambition will come under greater international scrutiny.
One suspects Morrison and other Liberal leaders understand key parts of their base object to Australia being viewed as a climate laggard. That much was made clear by the ousting of Liberal MP Tony Abbott in the blue-ribbon seat of Warringah at the last election. It follows that these Liberals privately recognise their net-zero timetable needs greater precision than the current “sometime in the second half of the century” approach.
Not all in the Coalition, especially in the National Party, share this view. Some will point to electorates most vulnerable to economic harm from reduced fossil fuel extraction, reformed land-use practices and lower agriculture emissions.
But politicians need to be adaptable. For Morrison to succeed in a post-Trump world, he must shift policies in a way that satisfies wealthy Liberal voters without driving regional voters to One Nation.
The Australian Labor Party will no doubt welcome the Coalition’s international climate discomfort. But should they regain power at the next election, they will face broadly similar issues. And the Greens will push Labor for aggressive targets hard to sell in key regional electorates.
Learning from the US experience
Australia’s journey to decarbonisation has more in common with the US than most other developed nations, such as those in Europe. Challenges and opportunities we share with the US include:
So a credible Biden pathway for both carbon-free electricity by 2035, and a net carbon-free society by 2050, will translate reasonably well into an Australian context. Once the US shows how decarbonisation can be done, Australia’s major parties will hopefully admit the transition is unavoidable.
One hopes this acknowledgement would be reflected in domestic policies to phase out domestic coal use – perhaps adopting US systems that financially reward storage and provision of backup power. Australia must also follow Biden’s lead and plan for electric vehicles with greater urgency.
More detail and less rhetoric on climate policy would be a welcome change across Australia’s political spectrum, including specifics on how affected communities will be helped through the transition.
Keeping a close eye
The Biden win is good news for climate action globally. But it will bring into sharper focus the breadth of change needed to achieve zero-carbon. And a more honest and open discussion about decarbonisation will deliver inconvenient truths for all players.
This, of course, assumes Biden delivers a credible and coherent climate plan. With Republicans in a weakened congressional position for the next two years, the biggest obstacle to progress will be internal fights between moderate and progressive Democrats, particularly in the Senate.
Political leaders in Australia, and elsewhere, will be watching closely to see how Biden’s team rises to the challenge, and what their path to success looks like.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/19/focus-on-industrial-processes-key-for-aussie-mega-solar-wind-projects-to-become-a-reality/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"JANUARY 19, 2021","Focus on industrial processes key for Aussie mega solar, wind projects to become a reality","Australia’s north is home to a number of plans to tap the strong renewable resource and wide-open spaces to create a new clean energy export industry. The 10 GW Sun Cable solar project slated for the Northern Territory and the 15-26 GW solar and wind Asian Renewable Energy Hub (AERH) in WA’s Pilbara region leading the way.
While seemingly impossibly sized, the projects are seeing increased support from influential energy industry analysts.
“The two mega-projects would elevate Australia to a renewable energy export superpower,” said Ernst & Young’s (EY) infrastructure advisory director Jomo Owusu, when releasing the consultancy’s 2020 Renewable Country Attractiveness.
The EY analysis noted that such projects could allow Australia to remain an energy exporter, as coal and gas exports recede.
Renewable energy analyst Michael Liebreich, the cofounder of what is now BloombergNEF, says that he too is “very impressed by the Australian developments.” He Liebreich that while the projects may be some two-to-three years away from realization, they align with the transformative impact low-cost renewable energy will have when developed at massive scale.
“For these mega projects … then it’s all about industrial processes, it might be hydrogen, it might be desalination,” says Liebreich. “I would love to see them linking up with ammonia and fertilizer production as it’s easily storable and transportable.
“Most of the process in renewables in Australia has been on the supply side, notwithstanding the efforts of the federal government, which has just been confused and misguided,” continues the Liebreich Associates MD. “The more difficult question is demand and that’s what I like about the plans for the Pilbara.”
Liebreich explains that in locations where there is available low-cost land, essentially deserts, and both a strong wind and solar resource, the cheap electricity produced at good capacity factors will cause a migration of energy intensive industries, or the production of hydrogen – the latter only when transportation challenges can be addressed.
“Wherever you can have both very cheap wind and solar – and when you connect those two then you don’t have the 22% capacity factor of solar, but you can get to 60% – then there really is an economic strategic advantage,” says Liebreich.
Crunching the numbers, Liebreich says that while the sub-US$0.015/kWh may not be achievable from solar in Australia today, something approaching US$0.03-0.04/kWh could be possible. Adding a battery storage component, at US$0.05/kWh for “the biggest batteries in the world” then energy intensive industries could be attracted.
“When these costs can be achieved then there is strong argument that all energy intensity industry will be migrating to these sorts of areas.”
Liebreich suggests that outside of Australia, some states of the United States, some parts of China, India, Chile, Spain or “almost all of North Africa and the Gulf,” could support such “renewable superpower” conditions.
“They [GW-scale renewable projects] are very significant because it was not that long ago that 10 MW was the size of solar projects – maybe a little over a decade ago. When you get to 2 GW that is a lot of power.”

The Hills Educational Foundation, which runs the primary and secondary schools, as well as the golf academy, and a 250 kW solar farm on campus, is also keen to use the hydrogen facility to provide theoretical and practical hands-on learning opportunities for students interested in renewable energy and hydrogen production. 
The solar farm, which currently produces between 30,000 kWh and 40,000 kWh of solar electricity monthly, was commissioned in 2017. According to the College’s website, the Hill Solar Farm was initiated to lessen the school’s carbon footprint and “decrease our dependency on the state grid, thereby also reducing our annual power costs.”

Now, thanks to international efforts, the Hills Solar Farm is set to be expanded to 2 MW in order to supply solar energy to the hydrogen plant. Korea-based and south-east-Asia-active renewable energy solutions company, Elecseed, along with Korean government-owned Korea Midland Power Company (Komipo), have already invested in the expansion. 
“This is a great opportunity to develop the use of hydrogen in South East Queensland in a practical, distributed environment,” said Energy Estate’s Director of Hydrogen, Kevin Peakman. “We are also pleased to support the carbon neutral goals of the College and provide a meaningful, hands-on opportunity to share that knowledge with the College and its students.”

The plant will be able to provide the Hills Educational Foundation, Hills Golf Club and other businesses with renewable energy 24/7 and ensure that the school’s campus buses run on hydrogen fuel. In a statement, Energy Estate said the surplus energy would be sold in the market primarily for mobility uses. 
“The Foundation has progressed towards a carbon neutral goal by establishing large ground based solar facilities, converting our diesel buses to run on hydrogen resulting in reduced diesel consumption, and are in the process of establishing a green hydrogen production facility and energy storage capacity,” said Joseph Marinov, CEO Hills Educational Foundation. “The multi-faceted project, that also includes potentially supplying oxygen to the adjacent wastewater treatment plant to reduce operational costs, demonstrates how the use of renewable energy to generate hydrogen can advance the hydrogen economy in Australia.” 
Elecseed and Komipo, the latter of which provides some 10% of Korea’s generation capacity and has a global portfolio of more than 16 GW in generation assets either in operation or under development, are also behind an ambitious solar PV project in the heart of QLD’s unconventional-gas country.  The Kumbarilla Renewable Energy Project (K-REP), based around a 200 MW solar farm in Queensland’s Western Downs, aims to deliver green hydrogen to Korea starting in 2030, following proof of concept achieved by an integrated pilot project, and quickly ramping up to full production for export in subsequent years.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/19/hydrogen-buses-are-on-their-way-to-australia/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BLAKE MATICH,"JANUARY 19, 2021",Hydrogen buses are on their way to Australia,"In December 2020, New South Wales (NSW) Minister for Transport and Roads, Andrew Constance, announced an accelerated 2030 target for the transition of the NSW Government’s 8,000 strong bus fleet. With buses moving that quick, let’s keep an eye out for Sandra Bullock behind the wheel. 
And in May of 2020, a major consortium led by UK-based ITM Power, which claims the world’s largest electrolyser facility, with 1GW per annum manufacturing capacity in Sheffield, England, signed a memorandum of understanding to test and demonstrate the viability of hydrogen fuel-cell electric buses in Australia’s public transport networks.
Dubbed the H2OzBus Project, it intends to initially deploy 100 hydrogen fuel-cell electric buses across up to 10 city hubs in Australia where interest and demand for fuel-cell buses has already been expressed.
It is not yet known how many, if any, hydrogen buses will form part of the NSW fleet transition but Foton Bus Australia and The TrueGreen Mobility Group have this week teamed up to form Foton Mobility Pty Ltd, a new company with the aim of delivering high quality hydrogen powered buses to Australia. Foton Mobility has ambitions to supply NSW and the rest of Australia’s transition bus fleets to hydrogen. 
Foton Mobility is launching its line in early 2021, beginning with a 12.5 metre low floor city bus powered by Toyota Fuel cells. The first of these buses is scheduled to arrive in Australia in April. Foton Mobility believes it can produce and deliver up to 200 hydrogen powered city buses to Australia in 2021. Of course, Toyota fuel cells are not necessarily produced with green hydrogen gas.
Foton Mobility CEO, Neil Wang, told pv magazine that their buses can carry approximately 22 kgs of hydrogen gas, giving them a comfortable range of 450 kms in urban driving conditions. “Our buses can be designed to carry more hydrogen onboard which would provide a longer range per charge,” said Wang. “However, in designing the first batch for Australian deployment we have been mindful of the limited hydrogen charging infrastructure so we have designed these buses to get the best range, without needing to install full scale mass hydrogen production facilities.”
“Hydrogen buses have many advantages compared to electric buses,” continued Wang. “A few key benefits are that Hydrogen buses only need 12-15 mins to refuel which is in line with current diesel fuelling time and just one hydrogen fuel station deployed onsite can refuel around 160 buses. Compared to battery electric, recharging 160 electric city bus would need installation of 160 charging stations. Importantly, we can make hydrogen in regional areas which will promote jobs and stimulate local economies.”
Hence why Foton Mobility is also planning the establishment of its own Australian production facility at the TrueGreen Clean-Tech Manufacturing Village in Moss Vale, NSW. The company estimates that it will be locally producing hydrogen buses in Australia by Q2, 2022. 
“I believe Hydrogen is the final solution for public transport” said Wang. “Many countries around the world are investing in hydrogen as their future fuel source. In Australia, most states and territories already have a hydrogen road map and excitingly we can now meet the demand from a product side with the release of our high quality, Foton Mobility Hydrogen buses.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/19/tesla-launches-solar-inverter/,"INSTALLATIONS,INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",MARIAN WILLUHN,"JANUARY 19, 2021",Tesla launches solar inverter,"From pv magazine Global. 
Tesla has come a step closer to a more comprehensive ecosystem by launching a proprietary solar inverter.
In the last years, multiple inverter companies have ventured into electric vehicle (EV) charging and expanded the power electronic ecosystem, repeatedly emphasising the inverter’s importance at the centre of the system. Tesla has gone the other way. Starting with EVs, the carmaker penetrated the residential solar market with panels and batteries but only now has brought an inverter to market.
The product – the Tesla Solar Inverter – comes in 3.8 kW and 7.6 kW versions featuring two and four maximum power point trackers (MPPTs), respectively.
That is slightly above average as most sub-10 kW inverters have just two MPPTs but the product’s efficiency is somewhat below the figures achieved by market leaders. Tesla says its solar inverter has 97.5% efficiency, though it does not specify whether that is CEC [California Energy Commission]-weighted or maximum efficiency.
As is mandatory in the U.S., the inverter comes with integrated rapid shutdown capability and provides arc-fault and ground fault protection. The EV maker says the product has been designed to neatly integrate with the Tesla Powerwall battery as well as the Tesla app, which enables the monitoring of power generation and consumption patterns.
Tesla has published select data about the inverter on its website, rather than a full spec sheet. It is also not entirely clear what the app will be capable of in terms of system integration and optimisation. As a rule of thumb, the more devices that emerge from a single vendor, the easier it is for software to align them to work in symphony and improve system efficiency and that was a trend seen last year.
The company may also choose to leverage its EV production capacity and power electronics expertise. EV drive trains require DC/DC and DC/AC stages as batteries produce DC power and engines can run only on alternating current. Whether such expertise is transferable to residential solar appliances, and would improve functionality, efficiency or robustness remains to be seen. The 12.5-year warranty offered by the Tesla inverter announcement would hint that at the latter.
