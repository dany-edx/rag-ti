”Amp is pleased to begin a strategic relationship with Natixis for future financing of Amp projects in Australia and globally, and acknowledge the continued support of EDC,” Amp Australia executive vice president Dean Cooper said.
Cooper said construction of the project, purchased from Australian solar developer Overland Sun Farming in 2020, has already commenced under an early works program and the solar farm is expected to be connected to the grid in early 2022.
When the solar farm begins production, it will generate approximately 235,000 GWh of clean energy per year, the equivalent annual power consumption of approximately 48,000 households.
Deemed a state significant development by the NSW government, Hillston Solar Farm will comprise approximately 300,000 solar panels mounted on single axis‐tracker frames. The solar farm will connect to the National Electricity Market (NEM) via Essential Energy’s 132/33 kV Hillston sub-station which is adjacent to the 393-hectare project site just south of Hillston.
Spanish EPC Gransolar Group has been signed to build the solar farm and provide operation and maintenance (O&M) services on the project for at least two years.
Gransolar Australia managing director Carlos Lopez said the contract is the company’s eighth project in Australia and the second it has completed for Amp, after delivering the 30 MW Molong Solar Farm in central west NSW earlier this year.
“2021 has been one of our best years,” Lopez said. “If we consider the current global situation, having signed three new contracts, reaching eight and 870 MW in a country as committed and supportive in solar as Australia, is a sign and a reflection of the value of the Gransolar brand.”

The Hillston project continues Amp’s expansion into Australia after the successful energisation earlier this year of its Molong Solar Farm.
The Canada-based renewable energy infrastructure manager, developer, and owner has also revealed plans to build a flagship 1.3 GW Renewable Energy Hub of South Australia. The $2 billion hub is to include large-scale solar projects at Robertstown, Bungama and Yoorndoo Ilga totalling up to 1.36 GWdc of generation supported by a total battery energy storage capacity of 540 MW.
Amp recently announced it had secured a lease agreement with Indigenous landowners in Whyalla to develop the 388 MWdc Yoorndoo Ilga Solar Farm and 150 MW battery while the company has already secured development and land approvals for both the Robertstown and Bungama projects.

While Malabar did not provide specific details about the planned projects, the company has already secured development consent to build a 25 MW solar farm at the site of the former Drayton open cut coal mine south of Muswellbrook.
Malabar chairman Wayne Seabrook said the Maxwell Solar Farm would generate approximately 60 GWh per annum of clean energy, adding that the existing transmission infrastructure in the region provides an opportunity to “substantially increase” renewable energy generation in the area beyond that 25 MW.
Seabrook said the partnership with EDF would bring global and local expertise for large-scale solar development in the Upper Hunter region.
“We are very pleased to be partnering with a global leader in renewable energy,” he said.
“Our partnership comes at an exciting time for renewable energy in the Hunter Valley after the NSW government established the Hunter-Central Coast region as the state’s fourth Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) in late 2020.”

EDF has been steadily building a portfolio of wind, solar and battery storage projects in Australia as part of its global efforts to double its renewable energy capacity from more than 30 GW of wind, solar and battery assets to 60 GW by 2030.
EDF unveiled its first renewable energy project in Australia in May, acquiring 100% of the 280 MW Banana Range Wind, Farm in Queensland from Goldwind Australia and Lacour Energy.
The $500 million project, in the heart of the Queensland Central REZ, also has planning approval for large-scale battery energy storage. The project is currently in the feasibility phase with construction expected to commence late 2022.
“We are very happy to take this important step in Australia with the Banana Range Wind Farm, which will be developed by EDF Renewables’ local team as part of a broader project pipeline,” EDF Renewables Asia-Pacific vice president Patrick Charignon said at the time.
“Our projects will deliver competitive, reliable, renewable power and help drive the transition to a sustainable energy future.”
EDF has also floated plans to develop a $250 solar farm near Winton, west of Tamworth in NSW with the company attending a public meeting in Winton at the end of May to discuss the potential of the project.
While details about the proposed Nottingham Park Solar Farm are scarce, the company said it has begun designing and mapping the project and will continue to work on it for another 12 months before a final decision is made.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/17/energyaustralia-progresses-plans-for-worlds-biggest-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 17, 2021",EnergyAustralia progresses plans for ‘world’s biggest battery’,"EnergyAustralia has called for expressions of interest in the development of the Wooreen Energy Storage System, a 350 MW/1.4 GWh big battery to be built where its Yallourn coal mine and power station are set to close in 2028.
EnergyAustralia has committed to delivering the big battery by 2026, claiming it would be “larger than any battery operating in the world today” – seemingly ignoring the Moss Landing battery in California which recently had a second 100 MW/400 MWh facility added to its main 300 MW/1 GWh first stage system.
By the time the Wooreen battery is constructed it may not even be the largest in Australia given that French renewable energy developer Neoen has announced plans to build a 500 MW/1 GWh big battery west of Sydney and fellow gen-tailer Origin plans to develop a 700 MW/2.4 GWh battery storage system at the site of its Eraring coal generator in the NSW Hunter region.
While the debate about where it sits in the size stakes will continue, EnergyAustralia’s chief operating officer Liz Westcott said the Wooreen big battery, to be co-located with the gen-tailer’s Jeeralang gas-fired power station, would be capable of providing cover for more than 230,000 Victorian households for four hours before being recharged.
“Its quick release during periods of high demand will provide immense value in maintaining supply and keeping costs down for customers,” she said.

Westcott said the Wooreen Energy Storage System is scheduled to be commissioned by the end of 2026, ahead of Yallourn’s closure in mid-2028, with EnergyAustralia to name the engineering, procurement and construction partner in the first quarter of 2023.
“Beginning mid-September, expressions of interest will open for businesses that are able to engineer, procure and construct our new battery storage facility that will become integral to Australia’s modern energy system,” Westcott said.
“Our future preferred contractor will help to maximise local participation within the Latrobe Valley and broader Gippsland region by drawing on the expertise of neighbouring suppliers and construction personnel.”
Having first announced the project in March, EnergyAustralia has been undertaking preliminary feasibility studies that look at technical requirements and potential environmental impacts. The company said planning and environmental investigations will continue through the remainder of the year with a planning application expected to be made to the Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning in the first quarter of 2022.
EnergyAustralia currently operates two utility-scale battery storage systems in Victoria, a standalone 30 MW/30 MWh big battery located at the Ballarat terminal station and a 25 MW/50 MWh co-located with the Gannawarra Solar Farm battery.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/17/regulator-recommends-changes-for-australias-rooftop-solar-sector/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 17, 2021",Regulator recommends changes for Australia’s rooftop solar sector,"Australia’s Clean Energy Regulator (CER) has recommended changes to the federal government’s Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES) in a bid to better protect consumers and improve integrity and accountability in the rooftop solar PV sector.
The recommendations are included in the Integrity Review of the Rooftop Solar PV Sector published on Thursday. The review was announced by the federal government in August 2020 following reports of consumer issues, defective installations, misuse of installer accreditation details, and safety and quality concerns in the sector.
While the CER noted in its review that the Australian rooftop solar industry is “strong with most participants doing the right thing” the final report identified changes which could be made to the current SRES regulatory framework “to better manage quality, safety and compliance risks more effectively”.
“The reforms will help safeguard those businesses currently providing quality services and products by focussing on removing unscrupulous operators from the market,” the CER said.
The report sets out 13 recommendations, including implementing new reporting requirements for installers, solar retailers and manufacturers, and giving the CER more effective powers to monitor and enforce compliance, including the ability to suspend installers, disqualify retailers and de-list components.
It also recommends giving the CER the sole responsibility for setting the eligibility requirements for, and oversee the operation of, installer accreditation schemes and the listing of approved solar components.
This means a significant change in the role of the Clean Energy Council (CEC), which currently has a co-regulatory role in the SRES with the CER, as the legislation relies on the CEC-developed and administered installer accreditation scheme and guidelines, and component approval and listing process.
The CER found the existing arrangement has “the potential to lead to role confusion” and recommends all enforcement be undertaken by the Regulator. The CER said this would still allow for an industry body or bodies to administer installer accreditation and component listing, with accountability to the Regulator.
The CER highlighted that the CEC has “undertaken its regulatory roles diligently” but said it is difficult for the CEC to undertake enforcement against accredited installers and component manufacturers when it doesn’t have the statutory investigation powers of a Commonwealth Regulator.
“As its primary role is as an industry representative body, it doesn’t have all the investigative, intelligence and in-house litigation capability of a regulator,” the CER said.
“There may be the perception of a conflict of interest with an industry body trying to take enforcement action against parties who may be its members.
“A single regulator with the typical statutory powers and capability of a Commonwealth Regulator will be a stronger deterrent to non-compliant behaviour and enable more effective enforcement.”
Other recommendations listed in the final report include increased sampling and testing of solar PV technology; for the installer to prove they were onsite during the installation of the rooftop solar PV system; and that retailers provide written verification the system will perform to the quote provided and that it is complete, connected and generating.
The federal government has welcomed the CER’s recommendations with energy minister Angus Taylor confirming $19.2 million has been allocated in the 2021–22 Budget to implement the SRES reforms.
Taylor said the regulatory arrangements recommended through the review will help ensure that rooftop solar PV systems installed under the SRES are consistent with the value of the incentive paid under the scheme and with consumers’ expectations.
“The recommended reforms will also ensure that any solar installers, retailers and manufacturers who are found to be doing the wrong thing can be held to account,” he said.
The CEC has also provided its backing for the reforms with chief executive Kane Thornton saying it is “appropriate to continually reflect and improve the regulatory framework to ensure industry integrity and proper oversight”.
“We welcome the greater role for the CER to leverage the compliance and enforcement tools of a Commonwealth agency to crack down on the worst behaviours in the industry,” he said.
“A more active approach to regulation and compliance from the Commonwealth Government is a good step forward and the industry looks forward to working closely with the CER to refine the regulatory framework for the sector,” he said.
Thornton did highlight that the solar industry has already begun acting on a number of the recommendations, including the requirement for installers to be on-site during installations, increased training and awareness about the expectations on installers.
“The Clean Energy Council is committed to continually raising the bar, improving standards and driving the few dodgy players out of the industry,” he said.
“This includes advocating for further regulatory reform such as cracking down on phoenixing in the solar industry, creating a national electrical safety body and the introduction of nationally consistent inspection regimes.”
Smart Energy Council chief executive John Grimes also welcomed the CER’s recommendations.
“The Smart Energy Council has long called for a single regulator for the Australian Government’s solar scheme. We totally support that recommendation,” he said.
“The Smart Energy Council also welcomes proposals for increased sampling and testing of solar PV components and increased accountability for solar retailers.”
The government said it will now consult on the regulatory changes to the SRES framework in the second half of 2021. This consultation will inform the final detail and implementation of the reforms.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/17/how-long-do-residential-solar-inverters-last/,"INVERTERS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 17, 2021",How long do residential solar inverters last?,"From pv magazine USA
In the first part of this series, pv magazine reviewed  the productive lifespan of solar panels, which are quite resilient. In this part, we examine residential solar inverters in their various forms, and look at their resiliency and how long they last.
The inverter, a device that converts the DC power produced by solar panels into usable AC power, can come in a few different configurations. 
The two main types of inverters in residential applications are string inverters and microinverters. In some applications, string inverters are equipped with module-level power electronics (MLPE), or DC optimisers. Microinverters and DC optimisers are generally used for rooftops with shading conditions or sub-optimal orientations (not facing south).
The technology ensures that each panel produces its max capability in real time and isn’t limited to the weakest link in the chain, or “string.” String inverters are subject to the “Christmas light” effect, where if one panel is not performing or is shaded, the rest of the panels connected in series will be limited to that panel’s production level.
While that makes it seem like there is no reason to have a string inverter, that is not always the case. In applications where the roof has a preferable azimuth (orientation to the sun) and little or no shading issues, a string inverter can be a good solution.
In a string inverter, there are fewer moving parts to break down, less complicated wiring, and a centralized location for easy repairs for solar technicians.  Typically they are less expensive, said Solar Reviews. It said that inverters can typically cost 10% to 20% of the total solar panel installation, so choosing the right one is important.
How long do they last? 
While solar panels can last 25 to 30 years or more, inverters generally have a shorter life, due to more complex moving components.
EnergySage said that a typical centralised residential string inverter will last about 10 to 15 years, and thus will need to be replaced at some point during the panels’ life. String inverters  generally have standard warranties ranging from five to 10 years, and many have the option to extend to 20 years. Some solar contracts include free maintenance and monitoring throughout the term of the contract, so it is wise to evaluate this when selecting inverters.
Microinverters have a longer life. EnergySage said they can often last 25 years – nearly as long as their panel counterparts. Usually, these inverters have a 20 to 25-year standard warranty included.
The same goes for DC optimisers, which are typically paired with a centralised string inverter. These components last for 20 to 25 years and have a warranty to match that time period.
A study by kWh Analytics showed that 80% of solar array failures occur at the inverter level. There are numerous causes of this.
According to Fallon Solutions, one cause is grid faults. High or low voltage due to grid fault can cause the inverter to stop working, and circuit breakers or fuses can be activated to protect the inverter from high-voltage failure.
Sometimes failure can occur at the MLPE level, where the components of power optimizers are exposed to higher temperatures on the roof. If reduced production is being experienced, it could be a fault in the MLPE.
Installation must be done properly as well. As a rule of thumb, Fallon recommended that the solar panel capacity should be up to 133% of the inverter capacity. If the panels are not properly matched to a right-size inverter, they will not perform efficiently.
Maintenance matters
To keep an inverter running more efficiently for a longer period, Those Solar Guys recommend choosing a cool, dry place with lots of circulating fresh air. It also suggested avoiding installing in areas with direct sunlight, though specific brands of outdoor inverters are designed to withstand more sunlight than others. And, in multi-inverter installations, it is important to be sure there is proper clearance between each inverter, so that there isn’t heat transfer between inverters.
Those Solar Guys said it is best practice to inspect the outside of the inverter (if it is accessible) quarterly, making sure there are no physical signs of damage, and all vents and cooling fins are free from dirt and dust.
It is also recommended to schedule an inspection through a licensed solar installer every five years. These standups typically cost US$200 to US$300, though some solar contracts have free maintenance and monitoring for 20 to 25 years. During the checkup, the inspector should check inside the inverter for signs of corrosion, damage, or pests.
In the next instalment of the series, pv magazine will examine the life of residential battery energy storage applications.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/17/semi-transparent-organic-solar-cell-for-window-applications/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 17, 2021",Semi-transparent organic solar cell for window applications,"From pv magazine Global
A group of researchers at the University of Michigan has developed an organic solar cell with a transparency of 40% and an efficiency of around 10%.
Conceived for applications in PV windows, the non-fullerene cell was fabricated with the polymer PCE-10 as a donor, and a near-infrared (NIR) absorbing, non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) known as BT-CIC, in an inverter design acceptor-donor-acceptor. “Non-fullerene acceptors cause very high efficiency but contain weak bonds that easily dissociate under high energy photons, especially the UV [ultraviolet] photons common in sunlight,” said researcher Yongxi Li, noting that these photons affect the device’s durability.
In order to solve this issue, the research team needed to prevent UV photons hitting the cell and, for this purpose, they placed a zinc oxide (ZnO) layer on the front side of the device. “The ZnO layer (of around 30nm) was spin cast from a ZnO precursor solution onto the substrates and then thermally annealed at 150 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes in air,” the scientists explained.
This layer is able to conduct the solar-generated electrons to the electrode, thus mitigating the issue with UV photons but, at the same time, it affects the performance of the self-assembled monolayer used in the device, and a layer of a carbon-based material called IC-SAM had to be added as a buffer. Furthermore, a layer made of fullerene material known as C70 was applied at the electron and hole transporting layer interfaces. “To prevent chemical and morphological changes at organic/inorganic interfaces over time, buffer layers are inserted between the bulk-heterojuncton and charge transporting layers for improving the stability of the contact interface,” the scientists explained, noting that the cell was also encapsulated in a ‘glovebox’ filled with ultra-high purity nitrogen.
The solar cell was tested under one-sun intensity with AM1.5 G irradiation for 1,900 hours at 55 degrees Celsius and lost only 6% of its efficiency, which shows, the U.S. group stated, that the device may still achieve an efficiency of 80% at the end of an estimated lifetime of 30 years.
The research team believes that the cell efficiency may be raised to 15% with a higher degree of transparency and that the device may be further improved by preparing the used materials as liquids. “Our results show that NFA-based solar cells have the potential to meet the market needs of high reliability, in addition to their high efficiency and potentially low manufacturing costs,” they concluded.
A completed description of the cell and the manufacturing method can be found in the paper Non-fullerene acceptor organic photovoltaics with intrinsic operational lifetimes over 30 years, published in nature communications.
The transparent organic solar cell was initially unveiled in 2017, when the research group said the materials used needed to adjust to the ultraviolet and near infrared wavelengths which are processed into electricity in the device. “Highly transparent solar cells represent the wave of the future for new solar applications,” said researcher Richard Lunt at the time. “We analysed their potential and show that by harvesting only invisible light, these devices can provide a similar electricity-generation potential as rooftop solar, while providing additional functionality to enhance the efficiency of buildings, automobiles and mobile electronics.”
The group estimated that up to 7 billion square meters of glass surface in the U.S. could be covered by the material, with the potential of supplying 40% of energy demand in the U.S.
