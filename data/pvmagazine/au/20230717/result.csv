As part of the initiative, the YAC and ACEN have formed the Yindjibarndi Energy Corporation (YEC) to progress the development of large-scale renewable energy projects on an area of Yindjibarndi country covering 13,000 square kilometres.
Plans include an initial target of 750 MW of combined wind, solar, and battery storage to be in construction within the next few years, representing an investment of more than $1 billion (USD 680 million). A second stage will target a further 2 GW to 3 GW of wind, solar, and battery storage.
In a statement, YEC said technical studies have already been initiated to progress investigation, permitting, connection, and development activities.
The partnership agreement between the YAC and ACEN has been framed to ensure Yindjibarndi approval of all proposed project sites, Yindjibarndi equity of 25% to 50% in all projects, preferred contracting for Yindjibarndi-owned businesses, and training and employment opportunities for Yindjibarndi people.
YAC Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Michael Woodley said the initiative means the Yindjibarndi people can actively participate in Australia’s renewable energy transition in a significant and sustainable way.
“We know that our country is well located for renewable energy development, so we made the decision early to lead,” he said. “The agreement with ACEN … provides long-term economic benefits to our community, whilst also ensuring that we can protect and preserve all areas within Yindjibarndi Ngurra which are of cultural, spiritual, and environmental significance to us.”
Clean Energy Council CEO Kane Thornton said the agreement between the Yindjibarndi people and ACEN sets a new benchmark for meaningful participation by indigenous Australians in the country’s transition to a clean energy future.
“It represents the kind of leadership and innovation that is needed to drive Australia’s equitable transition to becoming a renewable energy powerhouse,” he said.

ACEN International CEO Patrice Clausse said his company was grateful for the trust the Yindjibarndi community has put in it to explore development opportunities on their country.
“The Pilbara region is home to some of the largest industrial energy users globally, many of which have expressed their desire to participate in a transition to a carbon neutral future,” he said, adding that “commercial discussions are in motion and we’re currently having encouraging conversations with potential offtake customers to purchase the renewable energy.”
ACEN, which is owned by the Philippines-based Ayala Group, is the developer behind some of Australia’s biggest renewables projects. The company said its Australian platform has more than 800 MW capacity in construction and operations, and more than 6 GW capacity to be in construction in the next four years.
ACEN’s Australian projects include the New England Solar Farm where the 400 MW first stage went live in March, and the 400 MW Stubbo Solar Farm and associated 200 MW/200 MWh battery energy storage project.
The company’s Australian projects form part of its ambition to grow its renewable portfolio in the Asia Pacific region to 20 GW by 2030.

The Han-Ho consortium consists of Australia-based Ark Energy and its parent company Korea Zinc, as well as petrochemicals group Hanwha Impact and fellow Korean conglomerate SK Gas.
Han-Ho said it will undertake a feasibility study to investigate the potential for a large-scale green ammonia supply chain between Australia and South Korea with multi-gigawatt hydrogen production capacity co-located with renewable energy generation in north Queensland.
Central to the consortium’s plans will be the development of Ark Energy’s Collinsville Green Energy Hub, about 90 kilometres south-west of Bowen, which is now expected to have the potential to generate up to 4.5 GW via a mix of wind and solar. The renewable energy would be used to power electrolysers to produce green hydrogen, which would then be converted to ammonia for shipping.
Ark Energy Chief Executive Officer Daniel Kim said Han-Ho is convinced north Queensland has the potential to become a world-class producer and exporter of green hydrogen.
“We are committed to working closely with our key stakeholders to unlock and maximise this potential,” he said. “The collective ambition of the Han-Ho hydrogen consortium is to accelerate the energy transition by building new green growth engines for both Australia and Korea.”
The timing for a final investment decision on the project remains uncertain but would need to be made in 2027 to meet the schedule for exports in 2032 with construction expected to take about four years.
The project’s development during feasibility stage will be supported by the Queensland government which has announced an $8.5 million (USD 5.81 million) investment as part of its Energy and Jobs Plan hydrogen hubs program.
The state government said its investment will advance the master planning, development and infrastructure arrangements that are needed to transform Abbot Point into a hydrogen export hub including planning for the water and power supplies needed to produce hydrogen at scale in North Queensland.
“Abbot Point presents a unique opportunity on government-owned land, with existing deep water, port infrastructure and proximity to one of Australia’s best renewable energy zones making it a prime location for renewable hydrogen and ammonia developments in north Queensland,” the government said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/17/winter-westerlies-drive-differences-in-rooftop-solar-across-eastern-australia/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",PV MAGAZINE,"JULY 17, 2023",Winter westerlies drive differences in rooftop solar across eastern Australia,"Eastern New South Wales (NSW) received irradiance about 15% above normal for June, while central and western Victoria received totals 10-20% lower than normal according to data collected by Solcast, a DNV company, via the Solcast API.
These variations were driven by unusually persistent low pressure in the Great Australian Bight. This system set up persistent westerly winds that dragged cold and moist air from the Southern Ocean into southeast Australia. However, the Great Dividing Range along the east coast of the continent forms a natural barrier, which dries out these westerlies, giving rise to broadly sunny conditions across eastern NSW – great for solar production.

Australia high rooftop solar penetration – with more than 17 GW of installed capacity across more than a quarter of households – are concentrated in the state capital cities, and so weather conditions in Melbourne and Sydney have an outsized impact on behind-the-meter generation.
Behind-the-meter rooftop solar totals from the Solcast API show that this weather pattern has continued into July.

In Victoria, inconsistent and cloud-affected conditions are causing peak daily solar generation to drop to as low as 25% of nameplate capacity. In contrast, NSW is experiencing steadier solar performance, with peak daily generation consistently between 40-50% of nameplate capacity.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets globally.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/17/keppel-part-of-push-behind-3-gw-green-hydrogen-project/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND,SINGAPORE",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 17, 2023",Keppel part of push behind 3 GW green hydrogen project,"Singaporean conglomerate Keppel Infrastructure has added its weight to the consortium driving the development of the $12.4 billion (USD 8.47 billion) Central Queensland Hydrogen Hub (CQ-H2) project which would initially involve the installation of up to 640 MW of electrolysers to produce green hydrogen for domestic use and export commencing in 2028.
Keppel is now part of the CQ-H2 consortium that includes Queensland-government owned generator Stanwell, Japanese energy companies Iwatani, Kansai Electric Power Corporation, Marubeni, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and Sydney-based energy infrastructure business APA Group.
The CQ-H2 project, being developed at Aldoga, about 20 kilometres northwest of Gladstone, would initially involve the installation of up to 640 MW of electrolysers to produce 73,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per annum by 2028 for export to Asian markets, as well as supplying large domestic customers in central Queensland.
It is proposed the project, which has signed an agreement to source renewable energy from Spanish renewable energy company Acciona Energia’s proposed 600 MWp Aldoga Solar Farm, will ultimately scale up to more than 3 GW of electrolysis capacity producing to 292,000 tonnes per annum by the early 2030s.
The consortium has already initiated a front end engineering design study with final investment decision expected in late 2024 and commercial operations targeted to commence in 2028.
Keppel said when it announced it would join the consortium that the move is part of the company’s strategic plan to intensify its efforts in the development of green hydrogen and ammonia production for use in Australia and export to Asia.
“There is increasing demand from governments and industries for carbon-free hydrogen, particularly for use in decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors such as steel, cement and ammonia production as well as heavy-duty transportation,” Keppel Infrastructure Division Chief Executive Officer Cindy Lim said.
“Keppel is leveraging our domain knowledge and wide range of capabilities to develop integrated sustainable energy solutions across the value chain, in line with our Vision 2030.”
Lim said Keppel’s track record in developing and operating large-scale energy infrastructure will help to produce and transport green hydrogen in a “scalable and cost competitive manner for end-users in Australia, Singapore and globally.”
Keppel’s participation in the consortium also provides the company with access to a source of green hydrogen as feedstock for a green ammonia production facility which it plans to develop at Gladstone with fertiliser and chemical manufacturer Incitec Pivot Limited (IPL).
Keppel earlier this year signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with IPL to explore the development of a green ammonia production facility capable of producing up to 850,000 tonnes per annum for both domestic and overseas consumption, including an end-to-end export supply chain to Singapore and Asia.
The MOU follows from an earlier feasibility study which Keppel, IPL and Temasek commenced in 2021 on producing green ammonia in Australia for export.
