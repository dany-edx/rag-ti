This manoeuvre gives renewable energy projects the same expediency as other significant works such as the Big Housing Build.
The change will now mean that all new renewable energy projects in Victoria will no longer be subject to planning panel process and third-party appeals at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). The Victoria State Government today stated that this ensures that objections that have been resolved or dealt with are not caught in VCAT during the final ‘notice of decision’ stage. Until now, some projects have been delayed by two years in this phase.
Minister for Energy and Resources Lily D’Ambrosio said, “Victoria’s old coal-fired generators are closing, and the cost of fossil fuels are rising globally – and streamlining planning approvals for the cheapest form of new build power generation is so important.”
The faster pace is to be facilitated by a dedicated facilitation team that will oversee all renewable energy applications. The state government also assures that projects will also be continually monitored so tht blocks can be identified earlier and more rapidly resolved.
Even with an accelerated process, the state government is making assurances that voices of communities that want to raise concerns about a given project will continue to be protected as third party objections will continue to have a place in the approvals process.
Premier Jacinta Allan promised, “We will cut the red tape holding back projects that provide stronger, cheaper power for Victorians.” Minister for Planning Sonya Kilkenny underlined the goal of ensuring that more projects can provide Victorian households with cheaper and cleaner energy.
The Clean Energy Council has welcomed the changes under the DFP, saying that uncertainty on planning process timeframes and outcomes has been a leading cause of delay in the state.
Clean Energy Council Director of Energy Generation & Storage, Nicholas Aberle, said, “Our understanding is that renewable energy developers will still need to self-assess whether an environmental effects statement (EES) is required.” He noted that currently, projects that require an EES are ineligible for the DFP pathway, saying that this would cover many wind projects. “This should be reviewed to ensure today’s announcement delivers on the acceleration it intends to provide,” he said.

Since these methods are already widely used in the printing industry, production is significantly more accessible for manufacturers, with wide-ranging economic benefits.
The team of CSIRO scientists have collaborated with researchers from the University of Cambridge, Monash University, the University of Sydney, and the University of New South Wales, and their findings have now been published in the scientific journal Nature Communications.
Here, the team of scientists report the first demonstration of hybrid perovskite solar cell modules with serially interconnected cells that have been entirely produced using industrial roll-to-roll printing tools under ambient room conditions. These lightweight, thin, and flexible cells show power conversion efficiencies of up to 15.5% for individual small-area cells and 11.0% for serially interconnected cells in large-area modules.
Although these efficiency factors are below what perovskite solar cells can achieve in rigid cell structures, CSIRO’s Renewable Energy Systems Group Leader, Anthony Chesman, explains, “As these perovskite solar cells are printed onto plastic films, they are very lightweight, highly flexible and portable.” This means they can be deployed in hitherto untenable operative environments across urban construction, mining operations, emergency management, disaster relief, space, defence and personal electronics.
Earlier this month, the cells were sent to space as part of the Space X Transporter-10 mission. Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) are garnering much attention from the solar community. As thin-film semiconductors, perovskites are more widely predicted to play a role in upcoming electric vehicle batteries, sensors, and lasers, among other things.
While this promising next-generation photovoltaic technology has a demonstrated power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.1%, perovskites suffer well-documented challenges with commercialisation and scaling up their production. While high efficiencies have been produced in lab conditions, these have proved difficult to replicate in production.
Researchers from the Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science based at RMIT, Monash University, and CSIRO recently reported they have been able to remove the element of human error with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) in rapidly developing perovskite solar cells.
Now, with this latest breakthrough with roll-to-roll perovskites, “CSIRO’s thin and lightweight solar cells are now on the cusp of emerging from the lab to create clean energy in the real world,” said Chesman.
Such roll-to-roll printing of solar cells enables manufacturing on very long, continuous rolls of plastic, which can dramatically increase the rate of production, Chesman explains. Since this kind of printing is already widely used in the printing industry, such solar cells are radically more accessible for Australian manufacturers, holding the potential to create significant economic and environmental benefits.
CSIRO Principal Research Scientist Doojin Vak said that an automated system produced a comprehensive dataset that forges a path for the use of machine learning in future research.
“We developed a system for rapidly producing and testing over ten thousand solar cells a day – something that would have been impossible to do manually,” Vak said.
The prospect of unlocking the economic benefits of perovskite cells is now within reach. The next step for the CSIRO team is to work with industry partners to further develop and commercialise this flexible and highly adaptable photovoltaic breakthrough.

Collaborating with teams from the University of Adelaide and Australian National University, who are conducting geological surveys on the site, it is hoped is a pathway toward drilling for and extracting hydrogen from natural reserves underground, can be identified.
Black and Veatch will provide two concept designs for the drilling and completion of a hydrogen exploration well and for surface facilities to purify, process and deliver extracted hydrogen and helium, including co-production of the resources, if they are found together.
Mark Hanna CEO H2EX said the $2 million development study will help H2EX fast-track their first exploration wells and development scheme.
“If successful, hydrogen will be a great source of energy for power generation and transport on the Eyre Peninsula and help decarbonise the region, which predominantly uses liquid fuels for energy and transport while helium is also a high-value and scarce commodity,” Hanna said.
Black and Veatch Global Advisory Strategic Growth Managing Director Yatin Premchand said the company has an 80-year history working with hydrogen and ammonia production in multiple industries.
“The company developed the first hydrogen power generation conversion project and the first major hydrogen fuelling station deployment in the United States; since then, our experts have continued to deliver reliable innovation and first-of-a-kind solutions across the hydrogen value chain.”
After receiving an exploration licence in 2022, as well as six first-ranked applications covering 52,000 square kilometres, the H2EX study was awarded an $863,000 Cooperative Research Council Projects (CRC-P) grant through the Federal Department of Science and Innovation, in 2023.
The Australian Government is investing $526 million (USD 347 million) through the Regional Hydrogen Hubs programme as part of the government’s $40 billion investment to transform the country into a powerhouse of green energy generation and innovation.
New Rystad Energy research found the South Australian government added hydrogen to its list of regulated substances in 2021, which has led to many companies applying for exploration permits in the region, including Gold Hydrogen which secured a five-year license to develop its Ramsay project on Yorke Peninsula and Kangaroo Island.
The company found high hydrogen concentrations of up to 86% during drilling in late 2023 and plans to conduct further drilling in 2024 and launch a pilot feasibility study.
Rystad found at the end of 2023, 40 companies were searching for natural hydrogen deposits globally, up from 10 in 2020, and include Australia, the US, Spain, France, Albania, Colombia, South Korea, and Canada, in one case extracting at an estimated cost of $0.5 / kg, while projects in Australia aim for $1 / kg.
Minh Khoi Le, Head of Hydrogen Research at Rystad Energy said as an affordable, clean natural resource, white hydrogen may shift the role of hydrogen from an energy carrier to part of the primary energy supply.
“Natural hydrogen is expected to be low-cost, reliable, clean and have a low environmental footprint,” H2EX CFO and Director Greschen Brecker told pv magazine Australia.

Genex CEO Craig Francis said the company saw limited financial impact as Tesla incurred the costs associated with the minor fire incident in September 2023.
“The plant has been operating well and making a positive contribution to cash flows since commencing operations and ramping up to full capacity in December 2023. This has been critical over the peak summer period, which has seen significant volatility driven by warm weather conditions in Queensland.
“I extend our gratitude to Tesla, Consolidated Power Projects, Powerlink and Amplitude Consultants for the proactive and diligent manner in which they have supported us to reach this important milestone,” Francis said.
An outage was required to facilitate the installation and a period of testing by Tesla before the final outstanding hold point tests were completed with Powerlink and the Australian Energy Market Operator on Dec. 12 2023.
Following this milestone and conclusion of ancillary documentation with Tesla, Genex has granted the final construction milestone and made the final milestone payments to Tesla, which reflected the recovery of Genex’s full costs associated with the fire event, to conclude the construction phase of the Project.
Since conclusion of testing on Dec. 12, the Project has been operating using 40 Megapacks at its full capacity of 50MW/100MWh.
The Bouldercombe Battery Project is located at critical part of the Queensland electricity grid with high network strength and Marginal Loss Factors.
Genex signed a Connection Agreement with Powerlink enabling BBP to connect into the adjacent 275kV/132kV Bouldercombe substation, via an exiting 132kV bay.
Genex Power Limited has a portfolio of more than $1 billion of renewable energy generation and storage projects across Australia, including the Kidston Clean Energy Hub, comprised of the operating 50 MW stage 1 Solar Project (KS1) and the 250 MW Kidston Pumped Storage Hydro Project (K2-Hydro) with potential for a further wind project.
Other projects include the 50 MW Jemalong Solar Project (JSP) in NSW, a committed portfolio of 400 MW and up to approximately 2.25 GW of renewable energy and storage projects in development pipeline.

4,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/14/interview-guiding-consumers-to-make-smart-solar-decisions/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",JONATHAN GIFFORD,2024-03-14,Interview: Guiding consumers to make smart solar decisions,"It’s difficult to know who Australian households should trust when it comes to making a rooftop solar purchase. Selecting the right system size for present and, more importantly, future needs is a major challenge in itself. And throw in increasingly residential energy products like batteries and EV chargers complicates the matter further.
To assist households to make the right choice, the Australian federal government has produced a Solar Consumer Guide, which was released in late February. Renowned solar research institute the University of New South Wales (UNSW) was enlisted in the creation of the guide, which can be used in conjunction with the SunSPOT tool – from the Australian PV Institute (APVI).
UNSW senior research fellow and the recent director of the APVI Mike Roberts was involved with both projects and spoke with pv magazine about how the tools can help homeowners make smart solar decisions.
pv magazine: Why is a consumer guide for rooftop PV needed?
Mike Roberts: Australia’s got world leading residential solar, so one in three houses has solar. But that means that two out of three don’t, and apartments don’t, and a lot of renters don’t. So there’s still huge capacity yet to be fulfilled and also huge potential capacity on commercial rooftops. And I guess a lot of the easier roofs have been done. We’re moving into more difficult territory.
The economics of solar generally are pretty good. Most residential customers will pay their solar investment back in three-to-five years. But the detail is quite specific. It can be quite confusing for people.
The purpose of this site was really just to get as much information in one place from a trusted source. There’s also a lot of people throwing a lot of information around that doesn’t necessarily agree with each other. So, the guide is a one-stop-shop.

pv magazine: Back in the day, and I’m talking about 10 years ago or so, the Australian market was was known as being something of a dumping ground for some low quality product. How different would you say it is today?
I’d say there’s still a range, but I’d say there’s a lot more good product. There are some installers who or not so much installers, but you know, sales companies who will just sell you whatever it is they’ve got to sell you.
I guess that’s one of the things that we tried to make sure the guide did was to kind of guide towards the people who are looking more specifically at what’s gonna work for the consumer.
We don’t recommend specific installers. But what we try and do is give users as much information so they can be discerning and they can they know the right questions to ask.
pv magazine: In the installation segment, as you mention, there are those different players – retailers who subcontract installation, and then installers who handle everything from an initial lead right through to final sign off.  Do you see dangers in a business model that results in there being quite a disconnect for the customer between who they think they’re dealing with and who they’re actually inviting onto their roof?
They certainly can be, yes. It’s not necessarily a danger if it’s a reputable retailer. If it’s a reputable company, they’re likely to work with reputable installers. Very often if it’s a national or a statewide company, then it makes sense for them to sub installation to somebody more local to you.
But we one of the things that the Solar Consumer Guide says is ask that question: Who will be installing it?
pv magazine: Safety is, of course, a key concern. A few years ago we saw some rooftop fires in the US with some some larger, commercial, rooftop projects. In terms of rooftop solar and safety for homeowners, how safe is it in 2024?
It’s pretty safe. I’m not across the statistics, but I know that fires from PV are very rare. There were issues with some of the DC isolator switches and I haven’t heard any issues with that for quite a while. I think the I think the industry has upped to its game on that.
Really the only potential for fires is if it’s really badly installed these days. So again, going back to reputable installers is essential.
pv magazine: What is the key message for the for the consumer from the guide?
Make sure you know who you’re buying from and who’s installing it. And ask the right questions to make sure what you’re getting is suitable for you.
You know that they’re looking at your roof; they’re looking at your load profile; they’re looking at your financial situation and not just trying to sell you a generic product that they sell everybody. That’s where SunSPOT comes in as it will help you get the right system for you.
And the other thing I’d say is to think about the future. If you’re buying your solar system, it’s going last you at least 20 years, and in 20 years your energy use is gonna be very different to what it is now. What happens if I get an EV? What happens if I get a electric cook top? How’s that going to affect the optimum system size for me and the finances of it? I think people already should be starting to think about trying to future proof their home when they’re buying a system.
pv magazine: That makes metering data so important, doesn’t it?
At the moment, if you’re in Victoria, you’ve got a smart meter. If you’re anywhere else, you probably haven’t, unless you’ve already got solar. Once you get solar, you get a smart meter, which is great, but it would be great if you’ve got it a year before.

5,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/14/european-parliament-approves-legal-requirement-to-install-solar-on-buildings/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,EUROPE,WESTERN EUROPE",PATRICK JOWETT,2024-03-14,European Parliament approves legal requirement to install solar on buildings,"From pv magazine global
Members of European Parliament (MEPs) have adopted the EU Solar Standard, which will require the installation of solar on buildings across EU member states.
The standard forms part of the European Performance of Buildings Directive, which was provisionally agreed upon in December. The directive was formally approved by MEPs on Monday, with 370 votes to 199 plus 46 abstentions, and will now have to be formally endorsed by the Council of Ministers to become law.
The legislation says that if technically and economically suitable, EU member states will have to deploy solar installations progressively in public and non-residential buildings, depending on their size.
It sets a timeline of integrating solar installations into building works of new commercial and public buildings by 2026, on commercial and public buildings that undergo relevant renovations by 2027, on new residential buildings by 2029 and on existing public buildings by 2030.
Agricultural and historic buildings can be excluded, while EU member states can decide to exclude buildings for their special architectural or historical merit, temporary buildings, and churches and places of worship.
The directive is aiming to help reduce energy consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions in the EU’s building sector, as it works towards climate neutrality by 2050. According to the European Commission, buildings in the EU are responsible for 40% of the area’s energy consumption and 36% of its greenhouse gas emissions.
Jan Osenberg, Senior Policy Advisor at SolarPower Europe said the EU Solar Standard “puts the power in citizens’ hands and will enshrine the energy transition into the places where we sleep, work, and live.”
“As the grid catches up to the energy transition, installing energy generation where we use energy will also help the grid, by keeping electricity local and empowering citizens with the information and technical ability to use electricity smartly,” he explained. “They can see when they are generating more electricity and can adjust their consumption accordingly.”
Osenberg added that the law must be translated into reality with “effective integration into construction practices and building requirements”. He said exemptions, support measures and system design criteria will all have to be defined.
European countries including France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Austria and Germany already have similar measures in place, which Osenberg says ministers and stakeholders can use to draw upon the best practices.
A SolarPower Europe report, published at the end of last year, put the European Union’s total installed solar capacity at 263 GW, after 56 GW of solar was deployed in 2023, a 27% year-on-year increase.
The report also forecast 73.8 GW to be installed in 2025, followed by 84.2 GW in 2026 and 93.1 GW in 2027.
