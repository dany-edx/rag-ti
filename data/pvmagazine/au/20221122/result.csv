Now, an alliance of industry groups and community organisations are pushing for a similar policy to be introduced – only this time to foster storage technologies.
On Nov. 21, an alliance between Australia’s Climate Council, Smart Energy Council, community organisation Solar Citizens, the Clean Energy Investor Group and the Advanced Materials Battery Council urged the federal Albanese government to set up Renewable Energy Storage Target.
The calls for such a policy have been kicking around for some time now, but with federal Labor adamant it will take Australia from climate laggard to ‘superpower,’ the proposal has taken on a fresh urgency.
The policy, which would work on a combined regulatory and market based model, would unlock $42 billion (USD 28.7 billion) of private investment and create roughly 100,000 jobs in renewable energy, analysis from the Climate Council found. “It would do this by adding security and minimising risk for renewable storage investors,” the alliance said.
Such a target would be technology agnostic, capable of supporting both battery, pumped hydro and other storage technologies.
Australia’s energy ministers are currently in the processes of designing a new mechanism to support the stability and reliability of Australia’s energy system ahead of a meeting scheduled for December in Queensland.
The alliance urged the minister to consider a storage target, rather than a model which would prop up coal and gas – as many claim a “capacity mechanism” would do.

The project is to be built in Boggabri, a town in northeast New South Wales. (NSW), and will extend over 22 hectares of greenfield land. The development will deploy over 16,500 bifacial solar modules mounted on single-axis trackers, and is expected to generate 16.4 GWh of renewable energy per year.
Photon says the NSW project “will serve as a prototype for a future roll-out” across the company’s European markets.
The electricity from the Boggabri project will be sold on the energy market on a merchant basis, the company said, adding that it expects to break ground in the second quarter of 2023.

In 2020, Photon Energy invested in and formed a strategic partnership with Melbourne-based RayGen, a company which has developed “solar hydro” concentrated solar and thermal storage technology.
Together, the companies are developing a large-scale project in South Australia to showcase RayGen’s technology, merging 300 MW solar generation with 3.6 GWh of long-duration energy storage.
Ahead of that project, the two companies built a 3 MW/50 MWh solar hydro power plant with 17 hours of storage in Carwarp, northwest Victoria. That project was first connected to the grid in August.
Photon Energy’s chief technical officer and managing director, Michael Gartner, has previously said the company has a goal to add over 500 MWp of solar generation capacity before the end of 2024 in Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/22/new-us-policy-devastating-for-australias-green-hydrogen-ambitions-says-investment-manager/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 22, 2022","New US policy ‘devastating’ for Australia’s green hydrogen ambitions, says investment manager","David Scaysbrook, cofounder and managing partner of one of Australia’s biggest renewable energy transition investors, Quinbrook, describes the US Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 as one of the most “profound” policy measures seen in his career, and one which deeply implicates Australia.
“I think it will represent and does represent a material new export opportunity for this country that is analogous to the green new ‘superpower,’ but possibly not for the same reasons that we might have thought six months ago,” Scaysbrook said at a briefing on Nov. 22.
That is, until now much of Australia’s superpower ambitions have rested on green hydrogen exports. “The [Inflation Reduction Act] has some bad news for Australia in that context.”
“And that is the degree to which the hydrogen supply chain will be subsidised in the United States which will make it very, very difficult for Australia to compete with US exports of green ammonia, for example,” Scaysbrook said.

“At every step of the supply chain from the renewable power to the onshore manufacture of electrolysers through to the manufacturing of the actual hydrogen product and the degree to which that is subsidised – something north of $5 a kilo is just the end product subsidy – it will be devastating from a competitive perspective.”
While Scaysbrook says there may remain opportunities for domestic production and consumption of green hydrogen, as well as some export opportunities with proximate neighbours like Korea and possibly Japan, the export vision on which much of Australia’s strategy rests has become tricky.
Scaysbrook’s take echoes that of BayWa r.e. Australia’s technology innovation and hydrogen lead, Dr James Hamilton. Hamilton explained to pv magazine earlier this month why he sees the international export opportunity for green hydrogen and ammonia as much softer than hyped.
Coming back to Scaysbrook, he thinks the Inflation Reduction Act will alter the flow of capital globally and force major strategy changes, deeming the policy for Australia a “genuine double edge sword.” 
“There are fantastic opportunities in raw materials, mining, extraction… and we’re seeing some alliances being struck right now.”

Scaysbrook forecasts these alliances and partnerships will be the most interesting part of Australia’s renewable horizons in 2023. Over next 12 months, he expects “tangible commitments” will be made to new processing, as well as new critical mineral partnerships with the US, including joint ventures involving Australian governments at both the federal and state levels.
These moves he says will be more consequential than what is going on in the “vanilla” renewable energy space – that is, projects focused primarily on selling renewable generation into the national electricity market. “The risk/reward equation [in Australia] has until recently not been particularly compelling… and for what I would say are fairly vanilla renewables, I don’t think that’s going to change this year or even the year after.”
Scaysbrook expects many press releases and announcements, especially in the storage space, but doubts whether these will become tangible assets. “Overall, I think next year will be pretty lean in terms of investment numbers despite all the headline activity.”

Where Scaysbrook does see unique promise in Australia is in the development of new low carbon industries. 
“Without giving the game away, I think the projects that are directly fuelling these new industry opportunities that are more directly, physically linked to the supply solution rather than just generation wind power or solar power [hold the greatest opportunity].”
By this Scraysbrook means projects directly coupled to newly critical materials, industries or green metals manufacturing.
“That’s certainly where we’ve been focussing our attention,” Scaysbrook said, describing Quinbrook’s play as creating “industrial decarbonisation partnerships.”
“So this is energy intensive industries that need carbon-free power, energy, steam, heat to invest in new factories and new processing and mining operations. That’s where we think Australia does offer more opportunity for better returns because the demand is going to be there, particularly from America, and so you’re going to have a ready-made customer base.”

Powin and BlackRock have started working on what they describe as the world’s most powerful battery. BlackRock-owned Akaysha Energy is now developing the 1.9 GWh Waratah Super Battery Project north of Sydney.
The company was contracted to deliver a battery with a guaranteed continuous power capacity of at least 700 MW and a guaranteed useable energy storage capacity of at least 1,400 MWh. Powin has now announced that it will supply 909 MW of power equipment and 1,915 MWh of annual storage capacity.
Powin will provide 2,592 units of its modular Centipede BESS platform. Its EKS Energy subsidiary will deliver 288 power conversion systems. Construction is expected to start in 2023, with a targeted completion date in the middle of 2025. The BESS is expected to act as a “shock absorber” for Australia’s electricity grid, as part of a system integrity protection scheme (SIPS).
“This flagship SIPS project will unlock latent transfer capacity in the existing transmission system, help integrate renewable energy, and maintain grid reliability by acting as a ‘shock absorber’ if disruptions such as lightning strikes or bushfires interrupt the flow of electricity,” Powin said in a statement. “The proposed WSB Project will ensure Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong have access to more energy from existing generators while reducing the risk of power disruptions.”
Akaysha Energy won a bid to deliver the energy storage project in October. It will be built on the former grounds of the 1,400 MW Munmorah coal-fired power station.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/22/germany-to-import-green-ammonia-from-saudi-arabia-from-2026/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,EGYPT,GERMANY,SAUDI ARABIA,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"NOVEMBER 22, 2022",Germany to import green ammonia from Saudi Arabia from 2026,"From pv magazine Global | via the Hydrogen Stream
The German government has decided to collaborate with the private sector on the construction of an import terminal for green ammonia in Hamburg. From 2026, the terminal will import green ammonia from Saudi Arabia. Air Products will produce the ammonia and distribute it to end users in Germany, mostly for conversion into hydrogen. “[This] is a strong signal for the entire hydrogen market in Germany and Europe,” said Robert Habeck, the federal minister of economics and climate protection. The terminal will be built at Mabanaft’s existing tank terminal at the Hamburg port.
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said in its latest report that several of the G-7 leading industrial nations support hydrogen for light-duty fuel cell vehicles, power generation, and residential heating. “Despite hydrogen’s great potential, it must be kept in mind that its production, transport and conversion require energy, as well as significant investment,” IRENA said. “Indiscriminate use of hydrogen could therefore slow down the energy transition.” It added that governments should set clear priorities to avoid waste. It said those priorities include existing hydrogen applications, basic chemicals, primary steel production, shipping, and aviation.
Masdar and its consortium partners have signed a framework agreement with several Egyptian state-backed organisations to develop a 2 GW green hydrogen project in the Suez Canal Economic Zone. They are targeting 4 GW of electrolyser capacity and 480,000 tons of green hydrogen output by 2030. Egypt also signed a second agreement with AMEA Power to deploy a 1 GW green hydrogen project, as well as several other agreements, bringing the total value of its plans to USD 85 billion ($128 billion). Separately, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said it would lend USD 80 million to develop Egypt’s first green hydrogen facility.
Ballard Power has signed a purchase order with repeat customer Solaris Bus & Coach for 25 hydrogen fuel cell engines. The 70 kW fuel cells will be installed in 12 Solaris Urbino hydrogen buses and will be sent to Polish public transport operator MPK Poznań in the second half of 2023, said Vancouver-based Ballard Power. 
The California Air Resources Board has updated its climate action proposal, which supports hydrogen as a mitigation tool. Teresa Cooke, the executive director at the California Hydrogen Coalition, said that hydrogen would be used in fuel cells for zero-emission transportation, transit, goods movement, industrial activities, and power.
The European Investment Bank has signed a joint declaration with Namibia for a potential loan of up to €500 million ($773 million) to finance renewable hydrogen and renewable energy investments.
