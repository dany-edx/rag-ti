HumeLink will deliver about 360 kilometres of 500 kV double-circuit transmission lines, connecting Wagga Wagga, Bannaby and Maragle in the state’s south, improving the flow of electricity between new generation sources and the state’s major demand centres. It will also include the construction or upgrades of 500/330 kV substations at the three locations.
The project, which is expected to cost an estimated $3.3 billion in total, has been deemed essential for the success of the 2,040 MW Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project. Due to come online by 2026 but now not expected to be operational until at least 2028, Snowy 2.0 shapes as the largest single-point load yet to be connected to the National Electricity Market and the largest generator to be connected to the main grid in more than three decades.
The AER has approved Transgrid’s proposed cost of $321.9 million for Stage 1 of the HumeLink project. The funding will be used to conduct early works including project design, stakeholder engagement, land-use planning and approvals and acquisition, procurement activities, and project management.
Transgrid said it has already issued an Expression of Interest for key delivery partners to design, install and commission the infrastructure.

Transgrid chief executive officer Brett Redman said the funding agreement is an indicator of the confidence the regulator has in the HumeLink project, “which will reinforce the backbone of the transmission network for the eastern seaboard”.
“The $322 million in capital expenditure represents the next step in bringing more affordable, reliable and renewable energy to the grid as we deliver a next-generation transmission capability for NSW and the National Electricity Market,” he said.
“There will be no transition without transmission, and we will continue to work closely with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and the federal and state governments to accelerate this transition, which is dependent on a stronger, more flexible electricity network.”
The AER’s decision coincides with the release of Transgrid’s Annual Planning Report (TAPR) which for the first time, projects a shortfall of system strength and inertia to meet system requirements to happen in this decade, as coal-fired generation is retired or moves to more flexible operation.
“Australia’s energy transition is happening right now. The electricity system is transitioning away from coal and towards renewables at a rapid rate, even faster than expected and we are responding to that reality,” Redman said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/18/skills-shortages-could-cripple-renewables-boom/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"AUGUST 18, 2022",Skills shortages could cripple renewables boom,"From the Conversation
To make this happen, we must rapidly scale up our renewable energy construction workforce. Last week’s energy ministers’ meeting calls for assessment of the “workforce, supply chain and community needs” for the energy transition. The government’s jobs and skills summit in early September will tackle the issue too. While it’s positive the government is focused on these challenges, the reality is we’re playing catch-up.
Why? Because Australia is already stretched for workers, and it takes time to give new ones the skills they will need. Our research estimates the renewable energy transition will need up to 30,000 workers in coming years to build enough solar farms, wind farms, batteries, transmission lines and pumped hydro storage to transform our energy system. Most of these jobs will be in regional areas.
In coming decades, Australia will invest around $66 billion in large-scale renewables and $27 billion in rooftop solar and battery storage. This creates openings for industry development like the $7.4 billion market opportunity for an integrated battery supply chain and manufacturing which builds on our strengths, such as wind towers.
If we get this right, we can create new manufacturing and supply chain jobs and reverse the long drift of these jobs overseas. But if we get it wrong, skill shortages could derail the vision of a new energy system by 2030.

Much of the debate on the energy transition to date has focused on technical challenges like integrating renewable energy into the grid.
But as a new report from Construction Skills Queensland points out: “The biggest challenge in delivering the (renewable energy) boom could be the scale of the construction workforce required”.
Across the eastern states in the National Energy Market, the construction workforce needs to scale up rapidly to build wind and solar farms, rooftop solar, battery storage and transmission lines throughout the 2020s. As the volume of renewable energy grows, our modelling finds the share of operations and maintenance jobs will increase, making up around 50% of all jobs by 2035 based on the Australian Energy Market Operator’s roadmap for the energy system.

Notably, our projections include very few jobs in manufacturing. That’s because at present, most renewables manufacturing is done offshore. But as the country which pioneered key solar technologies, we could harness these investments to build local production.
While it sounds simple in theory, the hard part is making this a reality. How can we best scale up the construction workforce in regional areas? How can we best leverage public and private clean energy investment to increase local manufacturing jobs?
It’s going to be a challenge. That’s because we are already facing widespread skill shortages in key jobs such as engineers, electricians and transmission lineworkers.
Australia is in the midst of an “unprecedented” boom in infrastructure. Think of the huge transport projects like inland rail and metro projects in major cities.
Our regions are already struggling to supply workers for these projects. Infrastructure Australia has projected a shortage of 41,000 engineers and 15,000 trades in the next few years. This is a real worry for the renewables industry. Where will the new workforce come from?
Image: Lightsource bp
As the labour market tightens, there’s a risk skill shortages will become a constraint on construction timetables. There are industry reports of bidding wars as companies vie to secure skilled workers by offering higher wages. That’s great for the workers with the skills, but it also speaks to the fact the pool of skilled people is too small – even before we launch this major transition.
People in many regional communities are concerned the renewable boom could follow the mining boom with a reliance on fly-in, fly-out workers. This approach overheats local economies and housing and ultimately leaves little benefit, as towns like Karratha have found.
Governments will need to roll out regional programs to increase the size of this workforce, by creating direct training pathways to help school leavers get into the renewables sector. This can slow the well known “youth drain” of country kids to the cities.
Specific programs could also help First Nations people in remote areas into jobs close to their communities such as in best-practice solar farms and transmission projects.
We’ll also need urgent investment in regional training facilities, courses and apprenticeships.
While the federal government has committed to fund energy apprentices, we will also need more industry-government partnerships like the pioneering Energising Tasmania initiative to train and redeploy new and existing workers backed by government support.
And we will also need skilled migration as part of the solution. That’s because the regions cannot supply the full scale of the workforce required and time is short. But regional communities will want to see programs encouraging workers and businesses to put down roots. If renewables become another FIFO-boom, we risk community backlash.
While the government has many other things to juggle, this is a big one. Without skilled workers, we won’t reach the goal of transforming our energy system by 2030.

The transaction values the portfolio, which includes the Lincoln Gap Wind Farm project in South Australia, at an enterprise value of more than $1.44 billion (US$1 billion).
The transaction will see Ratch acquire a portfolio with a total capacity of 2,670 MW, including 500 MW of operational or under-construction capacity, which will increase to almost 1.3 GW by 2023, with a further 1.4 GW in various stages of development.
Following the completion of the deal, Ratch will work with Nexif in a joint venture work to manage and continue to grow the portfolio.
Nexif was founded in 2015 to acquire, develop, construct and operate a clean energy-focused power generation and battery storage portfolio across Australia and south-east Asia.
Since then, it has developed a portfolio of almost 2.7 GW in the Asia Pacific, including the Lincoln Gap Wind Farm project near Port Augusta which will ultimately include 468 MW of wind capacity coupled with battery energy storage. The 222 MW first stage comprising 212 MW of wind turbines and 10 MWh of battery storage already achieved full commercial operations in April.
Its assets also include the 154 MW Snapper Point gas-fired peaker plant in South Australia, hydropower projects in Vietnam, solar PV projects in the Philippines, and a combined-cycle power project in Thailand.
Ratch chief executive officer Choosri Kietkajornkul said the transaction marks a critical milestone in the power producer’s expansion plans, saying it “significantly enables acceleration to reach our 10,000 MW target”.
“After transaction completion, Ratch will recognise immediate income from four wholly-owned power plants with combined 450 MW operating capacity including a wind farm and a gas-fired power station in Australia,” she said.
Ratch’s purchase of Nexif’s renewable energy portfolio comes after it unveiled plans to develop a 70 MW solar PV and large-scale battery energy storage project near Morwell in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley.
The $105 million Morwell Solar Farm project will comprise an estimated 230,000 solar PV modules and associated infrastructure spread across two sites totalling 170 hectares. The planning approval also allows for a 5 MW-30 MW battery storage system.

However, their widespread application has been held back by the lack of a PV colourisation technology that has a low impact on power conversion efficiency (PCE) and is simultaneously mass-producible at a low cost.
To address this challenge, researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University have created solar panels that take on colourful hues while producing energy nearly as efficiently as traditional ones. They implemented a colorization strategy based on photonic glass, which was made of a thin, disorderly layer of dielectric microscopic zinc sulfide spheres.
By a fast spray-coating process, they showed that the photonic glass layer could be easily deposited on silicon solar cells, enabling them to have structural colours. Through varying microsphere sizes, solar cells with different colours were achieved, showing low PCE loss compared to normal black cells.
Using this approach, the researchers created solar panels that took on blue, green, and purple hues while only dropping the efficiency of power generation from 22.6% to 21.5%. Moreover, the long-term stability was subsequently verified by aging tests including an outdoor exposure for 10 days and a damp-heat test for 1000 h and the mass producibility is demonstrated by presenting a coloured PV panel with an output power over 108 W.
The researchers now plan to explore ways to make the colours more saturated, as well as methods to achieve a wider range of colours. They reported their findings in High-Efficiency, Mass-Producible, and Coloured Solar Photovoltaics Enabled by Self-Assembled Photonic Glass which was recently published in ACS Publications.

Magnis, which along with technology partner Charge CCCV LLC (C4V) are the major shareholders in the iM3NY facility, said the New York plant is working at an initial production rate of several thousand cells in the first month during the quality assurance phase.
Output will then be scaled up to 1 GWh per annum by 2023 before being ramped up to 1.8 GWh, which is the equivalent to about 15,000 battery cells per day. The company is aiming to increase annual production to 38 GWh of battery cell capacity by the end of 2030 to satisfy some of the demand for lithium-ion batteries.
“Despite a challenging global environment and supply chain issues, we have successfully started production close to schedule which is a major achievement,” iM3NY chief executive officer Chaitanya Sharma said.
“We now look forward to increasing production rates toward and over the gigawatt hour mark.”
The plant will manufacture cells featuring C4V’s patented Charge CCCV technology which relies on bio-mineralised lithium manganese phosphate (BMLMP) cathode technology. The chemistry, which is free of nickel and cobalt, incorporates traditional electrolyte along with a patented mixed metal phosphate composition in the cathode which the company said enables 3.9 volts of charge, one of the highest voltages of any lithium-ion cells in the marketplace.
Magnis, one of the companies behind plans to develop an 18 GWh lithium-ion battery factory in northern Queensland, said the voltage is 20% higher than lithium-ion phosphate cells and up to 8% higher than nickel cobalt aluminium and nickel manganese cobalt cells.
“All aspects of the cell have been considered and engineered to ensure maximum performance, safety and the ability to manufacture high volumes,” the company said.
Magnis chairman Frank Poullas said the first revenue is expected late next month.
“With previously announced binding sales agreements, I look forward to updating the market as we move towards generating revenues and increasing the capacity of the plant to meet some of the huge demand currently experienced for lithium-ion batteries especially in the United States,” he said.

BloombergNEF (BNEF) says its latest survey of global clean energy investment indicates that Chinese solar and wind energy projects are being used to prop up its ailing economy.
“Green infrastructure is the most important investment area that China is relying on to boost its weak economy in the second half of 2022,” said Nannan Kou, BNEF’s head of China analysis.
BNEF said China recorded US$41 billion (AU$58 billion) of investment into large-scale solar in the first six months of the year, up 173% year on year.
“The investment growth trend follows China’s strategy to build new renewable generation capacity so that it can replace its existing coal fleet,” said Kou. “China is well on track to hit its 1,200 GW wind and solar capacity target by 2030.”
That US$41 billion for big solar in China supplied the lion’s share of the US$66 billion (AU$94 billion) that BNEF said was devoted to utility-scale photovoltaics throughout the world in the January-June period. The United States was the world’s second-biggest large solar market in the first half, according to BNEF, with US$7.5 billion (AU$10 billion) invested.
With small-scale solar investment estimates bundled in, the world invested a record US$120 billion (AU$172 billion) in solar, including solar thermal, during the six-month period, said BNEF. That figure rose 33% year on year, despite much-publicised rising steel and polysilicon input prices, more expensive financing, logistical setbacks, and higher wholesale energy prices, according to the analyst.
While BNEF hailed a first-half record of US$226 billion (AU$324 billion)devoted to clean energy worldwide, but the six-month figure was actually down 12% on the investments recorded in the second half of last year, with end-of-year deadlines typically prompting more activity in the July-December period.
And while solar and wind investments roared along in the first half, the analyst noted a fall in backing for biomass, small hydro, and energy-from-waste, as well as a steepling 65% first-half, year-on-year drop in the value of public issuances of stock by clean energy companies.
Despite that fall in stock activity, Chinese solar manufacturer Tongwei raised US$1.9 billion in the first half and compatriot Jinko Solar generated US$1.6 billion.
With US$206 billion of the US$226 billion clean energy investment in the first half devoted to project backing, the pick of the bunch was the US$1.1 billion invested in Huanggang Dabieshan Power Generation Co. Ltd.’s 1.3 GW solar field in China’s Hubei province.
Of the US$9.6 billion recorded in private equity and venture capital backing for clean energy to the end of June, the largest deal was the US$755 million secured by US solar developer Silicon Ranch Corp., according to the BNEF report.
US energy company Chevron‘s US$2.8 billion acquisition of Iowa-based biodiesel producer Renewable Energy Group led clean power merger and acquisition activity in the first half, ahead of the US$2.6 billion paid by JP Morgan‘s Infrastructure Investments Fund for Italian developer Falck Renewables Spa, and the US$1.7 billion valuation placed on Japan Renewable Energy Corp’s buyout of Mitsubishi‘s energy and metals business, Eneos Holdings.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/18/indias-first-long-term-green-hydrogen-offtake-agreement/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"AUGUST 18, 2022",India’s first long-term green hydrogen offtake agreement,"From pv magazine India
Haryana-based Hygenco India has signed India’s first long-term green hydrogen off-take agreement with Jindal Stainless Ltd, one of the largest stainless-steel conglomerates globally. The agreement will see Hygenco build, own and operate a multi-megawatt green hydrogen facility for 20 years.
The plant will also purportedly be the first multi-megawatt scale plant with a long-term offtake in Asia to be commissioned in the next 12 months.
The green hydrogen plant will help Jindal Stainless Ltd reduce its carbon emissions by about 2,700 metric tonnes per year.
“This is one of the most significant landmarks for the hydrogen industry in India and globally as it demonstrates the competitiveness and cost-efficiency of Green Hydrogen. We are honoured to partner with one of the largest conglomerates globally and help decarbonise steel production, one of the most energy-intensive industries,” said Amit Bansal, CEO of Hygenco.
The state-of-the-art and fully autonomous plant will be controlled by an advanced energy management and control system. The system monitors several parameters, including hydrogen generation, renewable energy generation, states of charge, pressure, and temperature and makes autonomous real-time decisions for achieving high efficiency. The technology enables the company to augment the hydrogen yield and deliver cost-competitive hydrogen to the end clients.
Hygenco aims to invest more than US$300 million in green hydrogen projects across India in the next three years.
The large-scale adoption and scale-up of green hydrogen across industries is vital for India, which is significantly dependent on imports for its energy needs. This will significantly push the government’s ambitious National Hydrogen Mission, which envisages the production of five million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030.
