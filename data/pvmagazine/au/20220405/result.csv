The refinery is to be built at the company’s Eneabba operation north of Perth and will produce separated high value rare earth oxides including neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium, critical inputs for the electric vehicles, renewable energy technologies like wind turbines and advanced electronics.
The Eneabba Rare Earths Refinery, which Iluka’s managing director Tom O’Leary said should be “meaningful globally” during press conference yesterday, is seeking to answer worldwide calls for diversified supplies of critical minerals. While Australia is already a major exporter of rare earth and critical minerals, China completely dominates the refined or ‘processed’ market.

The global risk of this is becoming increasingly glaring with many Western countries scrambling to find alternatives – an opportunity which Australia has potential to seize. Processed materials are worth far more than the raw ones, with research from the Future Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre finding that if Australia can start “value adding” through processing as well as building onshore manufacturing capacity the economic opportunity could be worth billions.
Construction on the refinery is due to begin later this year with first production due in 2025. It will first use inputs from Iluka’s own stockpiles of rare earth bearing minerals, but is designed to process feedstocks from external suppliers. 
The refinery’s total rare earth oxide capacity will be 17,500 tonnes per annum.
The project has been enabled by a $1.25 billion loan from the federal government’s Critical Minerals Facility. The Commonwealth government has also entered into a risk sharing arrangement with Iluka, which the company pointed to as a key component of its investment decision. Iluka will put $200 million from its own equity into realising the project.

Both the prime minister Scott Morrison and treasurer Josh Frydenberg praised the project, saying it would capture more value on-shore from the country’s critical minerals as well as strengthen Australia’s position as a trusted global supplier of critical minerals. “Building a modern manufacturing sector and securing our sovereign capability is a key part of our plans for a stronger economy and a stronger future for Australia,” Frydenberg said.
Iluka says it has already received the key state and federal government environmental approvals for the project, and is now working towards securing further approvals and regulatory requirements. The Eneabba Rare Earths Refinery will be owned and operated by Iluka’s wholly-owned entity named RefineryCo. 
Since 2019, the company has accelerated its shift away from mineral sands mining to begin diversifying into rare earths. This has been driven, company MD Tom O’Leary said, by the “electrification of the global economy and the increasing policy priority assigned to critical minerals and their supply chains.”
It’s worth noting that another refinery is close to take off further south in the state. The Kwinana lithium refinery, a joint venture between Australian miner IGO and China’s Tianqi, is currently working on becoming the first battery-ready lithium hydroxide producer in Australia.
China is currently the world’s biggest refiner of lithium, controlling about 80% of the market, according to a 2020 study from BloombergNEF.

While the details of the agreement have not been made public, Bison Energy signalled that it plans to begin construction on the project in May.
The solar farm will be located just east of Shepparton in Victoria’s mid-north. The project site is approximately 15 hectares (150,000 m2) and has been leased by the company for 30 years.
Bison gained development approvals for the project from Victoria’s Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning in mid-March and has been granted a connection offer by electricity utility and distributor Powercor.

Bison owns the Cosgrove solar farm via its subsidiary Be Pro F. It said Bison will act as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) as well as the operations and maintenance (O&M) contractor on the project.
It is slated for completion by the end of the year, if not sooner.
In addition to Cosgrove, Bison said it has another project in Victoria which has reached the “ready-to-build” stage and is targeting financial close before August. In total, the company owns a 60MW portfolio, including eight projects in Victoria and New South Wales in various development phases.

Developed by UPC/AC Renewables Australia, a joint venture between UPC Renewables and AC Energy, the $768 million project will eventually see a 720MW solar farm colocated with a 50MWh battery. The lithium-ion battery could eventually grow to a capacity of 400MWh.
Construction of the first stage of the solar farm, 400MW, is already underway, including the installation of the tracking system, perimeter fencing and the substation – to which the transformers belong.

Responsible for transferring the solar farm’s energy into the national electricity network, the transformers were supplied by German manufacturer Siemens and will be fitted by MegaVolt. The project’s construction director Tim Greenaway described the deliveries as a “major milestone.”
The mega project reached financial close in February last year and work started just a month later in March, 2021.
Two more large deliveries are expected to reach the site over the next month, including the prefabricated building structures containing the switch and control rooms.
The New England Solar Farm’s two solar fields sit within the area of the New England Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), though the project was planned and had connection to transmission approved by TransGrid before the 8GW REZ was announced in July 2020.
Once completed, the project will produce around 1,800GWh of electricity per annum, helping plug the gap left by the region’s rapidly closing coal stations.

On Friday, AGL shut off the first of Liddell’s four coal fired turbines, signalling the beginning of the end for the plant which will retire this year. 
While the Liddell closure has been looming for quite some time, Origin shocked the nation and especially the historic coal county of northern NSW when it announced in February that it would be retiring its nearby Eraring coal plant in 2025 – bringing the closure date forward to the minimum notice period. 
Eraring is Australia’s coal fired station and while Cornwall Insight Australia’s principal consultant Ben Cerini estimates there may already be enough solar latent in the region to cover the massive exit, the network will require significantly more dispatchable power (such as that from battery storage) as well as additional transmission infrastructure and the acceleration of the renewable energy zone developments to plug the gap.

Last week, WA’s Minister for Regional Development and Hydrogen Industry Alannah MacTiernan announced up to $1 million in funding for the first stage of a feasibility study into big battery and green hydrogen hub for the town. 
The study, to be conducted by Sunshot Energy, chaired by eminent energy economist Ross Garnaut, will assess the economic case for establishing a renewable hydrogen hub through the use of an electrolyser to produce green ammonia and urea for agricultural and industrial industries. 
It is being called the Collie Battery and Hydrogen Industrial Hub Project, the key feature of which would be a 600-800MWh battery storing renewable energy for the production of green hydrogen and its previously stated derivatives. To put that in perspective, a battery that size is four times bigger than the Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia. 
The purpose of the ‘Just Transition’ framework for the famous coal town located 200km north of Perth in the heart of the South West Interconnected System (SWIS), which has been powering WA with its two coal mines since the 1880s, was to encourage investment in Collie from low emissions, technological and job-rich sectors.

According to MacTiernan, if the Sunshot study can prove the Hub’s economic case, the project could create $730 million of new investment in green industries and decarbonisation initiatives, including 500 construction and 400 ongoing jobs for the region. 
“It makes sense for Collie, which is at the heart of the SWIS energy system, to become a renewable energy industrial hub as we transition away from the coal industry,” said MacTiernan. “This project will provide a firm basis to progress a renewable energy hub in Collie. 
Collie-Preston MLA Jodie Hanns seconded the notion, adding that the Hub “is another project that aligns with Collie’s Just Transition Plan and is a good next step to keep energy sector jobs in Collie.” 
“The renewable energy hub could also help to attract new industries to set up in Collie,” continued Hanns, “including processing of critical materials.” 
Last year Sunshot Industries announced the Barcaldine Renewable Energy Zone (BREZ), what it is calling “Australia’s first regional zero emission business development” located in central Queensland. And by the looks of it, there are a number of similarities with the Collie Battery and Hydrogen Industrial Hub Project. 
According to the company, “BREZ will pioneer sophisticated zero emissions production of hydrogen, ammonia and urea, processing of minerals and intensive horticulture.”

Chinese module manufacturer Trina Solar claims to have set a new world record efficiency of 25.5% for its 210×210 mm monocrystalline n-type i-TOPCon solar cell.
The result was certified by the National Institute of Metrology of China.
The manufacturer said it will further develop the solar cell by using its production equipment from commercial manufacturing.
“We are very proud of these recent achievements,” said Chen Yifeng, head of Trina’s Research and Development Center for High Efficiency Cells and Modules. “Trina Solar is deeply involved in cutting-edge research and development and is a pioneer in technological production and manufacturing, which contributes to the company taking a leading position with its efficient products.”
In June 2019, the efficiency of Trina’s TOPCon solar cell stood at 23.22%. The record-breaking 247.79cm² bifacial device was manufactured using a low-cost industrial process, said Trina in a statement released at the time, on a large phosphorus-doped, cast-mono silicon substrate. That result was independently confirmed by ISFH CalTeC in Germany.

Prof. Overland, the war in Ukraine appears to have already disrupted the European and global energy landscape. Have we already crossed a point of no return? Do you believe the ‘back to normal’ option can now be completely excluded?  
Yes, I am certain that we will not return to the status quo that existed before Feb. 24, 2022. Although there are many uncertainties and possible outcomes, I don’t see how a return to the past could happen.
Relations between Russia and Europe have always been complex when it comes to energy supplies. Europe may encounter big problems by completely cutting gas supplies from Russia, but Moscow will always need a buyer, and Europe may still be its best client in the decades to come. Do you really think Russian gas can be sold in other markets, such as Asia or elsewhere? 
In principle, a good bit of Russian gas previously sold to Europe could go to Asia. However, it would require new infrastructure such as pipelines or liquefaction terminals for liquid natural gas (LNG) and take some years to prepare. And LNG may be difficult now because it requires foreign technology and know-how and sanctions will cause a lot of problems. Access to capital will be a problem both for LNG and pipelines, though in principle the Chinese could provide it for pipelines. However, even if it worked out with new pipelines, they would eat up a bit of the profit and the lack of competition between buyers would reduce profits even more.
What could be expected if Europe loses access to Russian gas? And what’s the likely scenario if gas supplies go back to normal?
If the Russian gas supply is lost, it may be a very tough situation for Europe. However, it may also help overcome the Putin regime in Russia, solving some of Europe’s long-term problems. High energy prices are usually a problem for politicians, but may be less so when the population knows they are due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. How it will play out, I don’t think anyone knows.
Which countries can most easily find alternative solutions if Russian energy supplies are interrupted?
I believe Spain and possibly the UK are relatively well-positioned to handle this. Perhaps also the Netherlands, if they are willing to start producing from the Groningen gas field again for a short period to alleviate the situation. Perhaps the most exposed country is Germany. Although I am a big fan of Germany, it has to be admitted that it has brushed aside all warnings and made itself highly dependent on Russian energy, in the process in fact helping facilitate the Russian invasion of Ukraine and imperilling Europe’s energy supply. Thus Germany also has the greatest moral obligation to make sacrifices to help resolve the situation. So far we have not seen this.
I think it may be too soon to outline possible scenarios, but do you believe the current situation will really be a big driver for more renewables expansion in the short term in Europe and globally, as expected by many analysts? Do you see more challenges or opportunities at this stage? 
Yes, I cannot see how these developments can avoid leading to massive investment in renewable energy, probably also nuclear power. I think the only question is how fast it can be done, and here lack of labor and equipment and dependence on Chinese equipment will be important factors. Anyone who has acquired skills related to the installation of solar panels, wind turbines, heat pumps or electric vehicles is guaranteed good work for a long time.
Higher energy and gas prices may be a good driver for renewable energy, especially for unsubsidised projects under bilateral purchase agreements. However, the current price volatility is discouraging this market trend. Do you believe this unstable scenario could last for a long time? What kind of impact could this have on clean energy development? 
As I can’t see how the conflict between Russia and the West over Ukraine can be solved, I expect fossil fuel prices to remain high for long. However the current war develops, it will be very difficult for Russia to give up Crimea, and it will be impossible for the West to accept the continued occupation of Crimea. And as this intractable nature of the conflict becomes clear to markets, they should gain confidence and their willingness to take long-term financial risk should grow.
We have seen many governments in Europe taking measures to support new deployments of solar, wind and heat pumps. Authorisations are now being given more easily in several countries and fiscal incentives are being awarded. Do you think that politics could now turn to renewables on a scale we have never seen before? Would this be a real mindset change? 
Yes, I think that is the direction we are going in. I expect to see a lot more regulatory easing than we have seen so far and it should also become easier to overcome ‘NIMBY’ (not in my backyard) instincts, which are a major obstacle for renewable energy developments, especially wind power. This is because I think the invasion of Ukraine qualitatively changes the nature of many arguments and discussions about energy, pricing and what people must accept. In addition, Russia has also very actively been supporting right-wing populists all over the West who are anti-climate and anti-renewables, both major politicians and parties. The reduction of this support, both because of crackdowns from Western governments and because of less Russian money and access, should also help reduce resistance to new renewable energy installations.
Which countries will be the biggest winners and losers of this crisis?
In the short term, Russia and Ukraine are the biggest losers. Ukraine has been subjected to a gruesome attack, Russia is shooting itself in the foot with all the weapons it has. Tens of thousands of young Russian men are killed, wounded or traumatised; weapons worth billions and billions of dollars are destroyed; the economy is devastated; the most educated and dynamic young people are leaving; Russia has become and will remain a pariah among all developed countries; it will take decades or centuries for the Ukrainians to forgive the Russians. Unlike the weak sanctions after the occupation of Crimea, the current sanctions will have a more substantial effect. In the longer term, Russia will inevitably continue to be a big loser as long as Putin is in power, while Ukraine may emerge victorious and greatly strengthened. Concerning winners, other oil and gas exporters like Canada, Norway, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia are big winners.
The USA is also a big winner, both as a major oil and gas producers and because Russia’s aggression hugely strengthens the USA’s position in Europe, as well as that of NATO. Countries that are at the forefront of renewable energy equipment manufacturing may also see great long-term benefits, for example Denmark. The current developments will also reinforce the trend towards a geopolitical rebalancing based on the decline of fossil fuels and rise of renewables. The invasion also strengthens the Democrats within the USA, which is again good for the USA as long as Trump is the alternative. Russophobes of all hues are also big winners and can send a big thanks to Vladimir Putin.
