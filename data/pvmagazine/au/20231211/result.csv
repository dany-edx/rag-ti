The $300 million (USD 196 million) project involves an initial 100 MW PV facility that can be expanded in stages up to 500 MW. Woodside has also outlined plans to include up to 2,000 MWh of battery energy storage – although this development approval is limited to the solar farm component only.
The company said the Woodside Power Project will see a solar facility and big battery built on a 975-hectare site in the Maitland Strategic Industrial Area, approximately 15 kilometres southwest of Karratha.
Woodside said the project will supply renewable energy for use by industrial customers on the Burrup Peninsula, including its own Pluto liquid natural gas (LNG) export facility.
All transmission of power from the solar facility would be delivered via the North West Interconnected System (NWIS), through existing or new infrastructure owned by regional utility Horizon Power.
Woodside Chief Executive Officer Meg O’Neill has previously said the company is looking to capitalise on the region’s “world-class renewable energy resources” and the willingness of industry, government and other key stakeholders to co-operate on new energy opportunities.
“Woodside’s vision is for large-scale supply of renewable energy to existing and future industry on the Burrup Peninsula,” she said.
“We are lucky to have access to abundant natural resources, safe and reliable energy operations and both industry and government that are motivated to drive sustainable energy outcomes.”
The planning approval for the solar farm comes just days after Woodside joined other global players in signing the oil and gas decarbonisation charter at the COP28 summit being held in the United Arab Emirates.
The charter, aimed at accelerating methane emissions reduction, includes major industry players like BP, Shell, TotalEnergies and ExxonMobil, among its 50 signatories.
Under the charter, signatories have agreed to end routine flaring and “near-zero upstream methane emissions” by 2030.
O’Neill said the charter reinforces Woodside’s existing commitments to reducing carbon and methane emissions and to investing in the products and services customers need as they do the same.
“The signatories have also agreed to work towards industry best practices and key actions in a number of areas,” she said.
“[These include] emissions reduction, investing in renewables and low-carbon fuels, and improved transparency through enhanced measurement, reporting and verification of greenhouse gas emissions.”
Woodside has committed to reducing its carbon emission by 30% by 2030 and plans to achieve net zero by 2050 or sooner and has previously outlined plans to target investments of more than $7 billion (USD 5 billion) in emerging new energy this decade.
That however compares with its planned spend on large-scale oil and gas projects, including its Scarborough gas field project off the coast of Western Australia.
With a price tag of $16.5 billion, the project will involve the construction of a 430-kilometre pipeline, linking the Scarborough gas field to the mainland, as well as a second production train at the Pluto LNG processing plant.

The explanatory notes that accompany the new regulation estimates that the up-front cost of a battery system in Queensland is more than $9,000, which can be considered “uneconomic for most consumers.”
“While solar costs have come down considerably over the past decade, access to capital to purchase a solar battery remains a barrier for lower-income households,” the regulation reads.
“The purpose of assistance under the scheme is to give individual owners of residential premises a rebate to offset the cost of having an approved battery system suitably installed at the premises.”
While the government is yet to announce when the Battery Booster Rebate Scheme will commence, Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni told the ABC that it is due to begin next year.
“Part of our revolutionary Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan is the development of a new household program, including support for batteries, to further support Queenslanders manage their electricity bills and usage,” he said. “Our Battery Booster Rebate Scheme is designed to do that.”
The new household battery rebate scheme is targeted at households with a combined taxable income of less than $180,000 a year. Households with an income less than $66,667 per annum can access a rebate of $4000, while those that earn above that threshold will be eligible for a $3,000 payment.
Up to 4,000 households are projected to benefit from the program with the explanatory notes indicating the Queensland and federal governments have each allocated $12 million to the scheme over two years.
The move has been welcomed by Queensland Conservation Council campaigner Stephanie Gray, who said supporting the greater uptake of household battery storage is a forward-looking initiative that will play a pivotal role in the deployment of renewables.
“We’ve seen Queensland’s coal-fired power stations become less and less reliable as they get older,” she said. “Increasing the uptake of batteries, including household, community and network batteries, increases the resilience of our energy system and will help keep the lights on. Batteries can react with lightning speed to plug gaps in our electricity supply.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/11/synergy-secures-planning-approval-for-2-gwh-big-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 11, 2023",Synergy secures planning approval for 2 GWh big battery,"Western Australia’s Regional Joint Development Assessment Panel has approved Synergy’s plans to construct a 500 MW, four-hour battery energy storage system near the coal town of Collie and has also provided a green light for infrastructure approvals to support a possible expansion to 1,000 MW/4,000 MWh.
Synergy is planning to build the $1.6 billion (USD 1.05 billion) Collie Battery Energy Storage System (CBESS) approximately 200 kilometres southwest of state capital Perth, just north of the existing coal-fired Collie Power Station that is to be retired by 2027.
The first stage of the proposed development will comprise the installation of two 250 MW/ 1,000 MWh ‘sub facilities’ featuring 656 battery enclosures, 164 inverters and up to four 330/33kV transformer units.
The CBESS will connect via the existing Shotts Terminal to the South West Interconnected System (SWIS), the electricity grid that supplies power to Perth and more than one million homes and businesses between Geraldton and Esperance and east to Kalgoorlie.
Synergy said the battery will help provide the state’s power grid with the capacity it needs to remain reliable and affordable as the state moves towards emissions-free power generation in 2030.
“The proposal is pivotal to Synergy’s energy transition program and represents a generational opportunity to support carbon emissions reduction and secure energy supply,” the application reads.
While no date has been given for the start of construction, Synergy said it is expecting the battery to commence the commissioning process in October 2025.
The Collie BESS is the third grid-scale battery being built by Synergy in the state’s soutwest.
The government-owned energy generator and retailer has already completed construction of the 100 MW/200 MWh Kwinana battery energy storage system about 30 kilometres south of Perth and has started work on a new 200 MW/800 MWh big battery being built adjacent to that facility.
French renewables giant Neoen is also in the process of building a 1 GW /4 GWh battery in Collie as the state government seeks to ramp up energy storage capacity to support its planned transition from coal-fired power to renewables.
Neoen started construction of its Collie battery in June, about the same time the company was awarded a contract by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to provide almost all of the project’s Stage 1 capacity to help smooth the state’s solar duck curve.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/11/vast-scores-edf-support-for-concentrated-solar-power-technology/,"STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,FRANCE",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 11, 2023",Vast scores EDF support for concentrated solar power technology,"Vast Renewables has announced it will partner with EDF Renewables to deliver multiple long-duration storage and green fuels projects in Australia featuring Vast’s concentrated solar power (CSP) technology that uses mirrors to concentrate and capture heat from the sun in solar receivers before generating heat and dispatchable power during the day or night.
The Sydney-based developer said its CSP 3.0 technology allows plants to be configured with four to 16 hours of storage and generators of up to 500 MW, providing clean, dispatchable renewable energy for utility-scale power, industrial heat and clean fuel production applications.
Vast founder Johnny Kahlbetzer said EDF’s capital commitment, which remains subject to a number of conditions including Vast completing a NASDAQ listing through a merger with a United States special purpose acquisitions company, is a “fantastic” validation of the company’s 14-year journey.
Vast Chief Executive Officer Craig Wood said the partnership will bring together Vast’s CSP 3.0 technology and EDF’s track record of developing, designing, delivering and operating clean energy projects.
“As one of the largest energy utilities in the world, EDF operates gigawatts of renewable projects and has world-leading expertise in the use of sodium as a heat transfer fluid,” he said. “We look forward to working with EDF Australia to deliver long-duration storage and green fuels projects.”
Vast’s proprietary CSP technology relies on mirrors to concentrate and capture heat from the sun in solar receivers. The heat is then transferred via liquid sodium and stored in molten salt. The stored energy can then be used to heat water to create steam to drive a turbine and produce electricity, or the heat can also be used directly to decarbonise some industrial processes.
The technology is on show at Jemalong in regional New South Wales where a 1 MW pilot plant, which was constructed adjacent to a 50 MW solar PV project, has been delivering electricity to the grid since early 2018.
Vast is also developing a 30 MW plant with eight hours of full-load storage near Port Augusta in South Australia.
The VS1 project seeks to demonstrate the technical and operational performance of Vast’s modular CSP technology at utility scale. The grid-connected facility is expected to become operational in 2025. Vast will also build a 7,300-tonnes-a-year green methanol plant next door that will be partially powered by the 30 MW plant.
EDF Australia Country Manager James Katsikas said the partnership with Vast aligns with the company’s plan to deliver a portfolio of clean energy projects across Australia and said the group is uniquely placed to accelerate the commercialisation of cutting-edge technologies like Vast’s CSP 3.0 technology.
“With our knowledge and experience, we are well-equipped to successfully execute multiple projects within the clean-energy value chain,” he said.
“We look forward to collaborating with Vast and believe this arrangement has the potential to accelerate the nation’s transition towards clean energy production and consumption.”

Solar is the cheapest new-build electricity in many markets, even amid inflation and price rises, said EY, noting that the global weighted average levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar is now 29% lower than the cheapest fossil fuel alternative. Large-scale energy storage is also quickly becoming more cost-competitive and sophisticated, it said.
Solar has rapidly fallen in average LCOE globally, from more than $600/MWh (USD 400) in the early 2010s to about $74/MWh (USD 49) in 2022, down 88%. Wind power LCOE has fallen roughly 60% over the same period.

“A global solar boom will power more than half of this, but adoption will vary across markets. Solar-generated power will become the biggest source of energy in countries such as the US, and those in Oceania and South Asia, driven by technologies around solar PV modules advancing at rapid pace,” said EY.
However, these landmarks will not be reached without clearing major barriers to progress, EY said. Particularly in the United States, a backlog of grid interconnection applications is causing delays, cancellations, and large incurred costs. EY said that the United States has at least 1,350 GW of wind and solar capacity and 680 GW of storage is waiting to be connected, which is enough to double the country’s electricity supply.
In a survey of more than 70,000 global consumers, EY found that sentiment towards residential solar adoption is strong. About 62% of survey respondents said they have bought or are thinking about buying solar panels, while 50% are considering buying or have already purchased battery storage.
