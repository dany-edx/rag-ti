The Vision Style product is available in three versions with power output ranging from 370 W to 380 W and a power conversion efficiency of between 19.9% and 20.4%. It measures 1,780х1,052х40mm, weighs 25 kg and is built with 120 monocrystalline PERC cells with a size of 166x83mm.
The panel features an open-circuit voltage ranging from 33.9 V to 34.5 V and a short-circuit current of 10.99 A to 11.15 А. The maximum system voltage is 1,000 V.
The Vision Pure module is available with three different wattages spanning from 365 W to 375 W and efficiency ranging from 19.6% to 20.2%. It has the same size, weight, and number of cells as the Vision Style panel and also the same system voltage. Its open-circuit voltage ranges from 33.6 V to 34.2 V and the short-circuit current is between 11.45 A and 11.65 А.
The temperature coefficient for both panels is -0.37% and the manufacturer offers a 30-year product guarantee and a 30-year power output guarantee. The panels are said to be able to operate at 87% of their original performance at the end of the guarantee period.
The company said the new modules are being produced at its manufacturing facility in Dresden, eastern Germany, where it recently invested €15 million in the deployment of its new F8 production line. Another pilot line is expected to be installed at the factory next year, the manufacturer added, without providing more details.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/18/huawei-enters-australias-residential-battery-market-with-modular-luna2000/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 18, 2021",Huawei enters Australia’s residential battery market with modular Luna2000,"Huawei launched its home battery, the Luna2000 energy storage system, at the Smart Energy Conference in Sydney last week. The modular battery marks the Chinese company’s foray into storage for Australia’s rooftop solar boom, a segment expected to grow significantly thanks to a combination of increased government subsidies, solar penetration causing electricity export prices to plummet and the growing influence of virtual power plants (VPPs) opening up new sources of revenue for battery owners.
Product managers for Huawei Australia’s solar business, Simon Wang and Haider Khan, gave pv magazine Australia a rundown on the battery system’s features and where they see it fitting into the Australian landscape. Retailing for under $10,000 for a 10 kWh system, the battery has already been approved for South Australia’s home battery scheme subsidy.
Huawei/Smart Energy Conference
Khan says Huawei is also working with Discover Energy, trialling the Luna2000 on its virtual power plant platform which essentially aggregates home batteries through software so they can participate in profitable electricity spot markets.
The storage system made up of 5 kWh modules which can be stacked directly on one another to created a 15 kWh system. Another three modules (up to 15 kWh) are able to be joined in parallel, sitting side by side, to scale the battery system to a total capacity of 30 kWh. The maximum output per module is 2.5 kW.
Huawei
The battery can be paired with both single and three phase residential inverters, which Huawei hopes will make its systems easier for retailers to both install and sell.
The batteries are able to be fitted either to walls or simply placed on the ground outdoors, and have been built to be both water and dust resistant.
Each battery module weighs about 50kg and each power module which accompanies the stack weighs 12kg. Which is to say, the weight is about 62kg for a 5kWh system and goes up to 162kg for a 15 kWh system. While it sounds like a lot, the Luna2000 has a sleek design not dissimilar to the popular Tesla Powerwall giving the system a lightweight look.
While Huawei is primarily targeting the residential PV segment, the battery’s scalability of up to 30 kWh means the Luna2000 system could also be used for small commercial applications. 

While the 5 kWh modules are built to be added to one another, each functions independently and has its own battery management system (BMS). Likewise, each module is covered by its own 10 year warranty.
The battery modules also charge and discharge independently from one another thanks to the energy optimiser, meaning the impact of underperforming cell is limited to the affected module.
Another selling point for the battery is its depth of discharge – which unlike most lithium-based chemistries is able to be 100% discharged.

Given the growing reports of DC isolators on rooftop solar systems catching fire, safety has been a major focus for Huawei in entering the Australian landscape.
To that end, the company has added three layers of protection to each battery module, including AI-powered internal short circuit detection, temperature sensors to detect overheating, and built in current and voltage sensors. Each module also has a fire extinguishing bag.
These safety mechanisms are all backed up by the battery management system (BMS) which is driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI).
To that end, Khan says battery’s chemistry, which adds phosphate into the traditional lithium-iron mix, helps to stabilise the system.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/18/regulator-expands-fraud-detection-introduces-new-anonymous-online-tool-to-growing-arsenal/,"LEGAL,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 18, 2021","Regulator expands fraud detection, introduces new anonymous online tool to growing arsenal","Commonwealth government agency, the Clean Energy Regulator, has introduced yet another means to crackdown on fraudulent activity in the solar industry, adopting platform Whispli which allows Australia’s to anonymously lodge reports of fraudulent behaviour through a new Online Reporting Tool which can be used on mobile phones or web apps.
“Whispli is an additional channel to report potential fraud across all our schemes and aligns with our compliance policy for education, monitoring and enforcement activities to report any potential fraudulent or non-compliant behaviour,” a spokesperson for the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) told pv magazine Australia.
Allegations made via the online platform are then routed to a relevant agency investigator. “Where the allegation relates to a Public Interest Disclosure, the matter will be referred to an Authorised Officer,” the Regulator said.
The whistleblower and agency member are then able discuss the allegation in the online platform where anonymity is protected, and if deemed credible the allegation will be conventionally investigated with the Regulator’s growing suite of tools.
The online tool is the second measure to be introduced by the Regulator in a matter of months, and comes shortly before the findings of its Rooftop Solar Sector Review are set to be released.
The Rooftop Solar Sector Review came at the request of the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction in August, 2020. It was carried out by the Regulator with the support of Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, and investigates concerns around the integrity of Australia’s Small-Scale Renewable Scheme (SRES), which is the backbone of our residential solar subsidies. The Review’s findings are expected to be made public in the coming month.
Since the scheme pays for about one third of the cost of installing a residential solar system, its integrity is a priority for the government agency, which also notes that it is about ensuring all solar installations meet a quality benchmark.
 “The false claims of STC [Small-Scale Technology Certificates] has been identified as a risk to the integrity of the scheme and the new initiative undertaken by the agency such as the introduction of Whispli and the taskforce are aimed to ensure scheme participants meet all the requirements and guidelines of the scheme,” a spokesperson for the Regulator told pv magazine Australia.
Earlier this month, the Regulator officially launched its installer taskforce, a joint action with industry peak body, the Clean Energy Council (CEC). The taskforce targets CEC-accredited installers making false statements in their Small-Scale Technology Certificate (STC) claims, which underpin residential solar subsidies.
While the Regulator says fraud is far from rife, it notes that quantifying numbers is difficult. “The Small-scare Renewable Scheme (SRES) is a high-volume scheme (over 400,000 installations expected this year) and we believe the overall rate of fraud is low. However, this subjective view is based on our detection of fraud and the controls we have in place to prevent fraud – hence, quantifying how prevalent is problematic,” it said.
In the past year, the Regulator has made serious inroads by introducing a range of new measures and rules in two the areas where fraud is suspected to be most prevalent: installers making false claims and the installation of unapproved solar panels.
“In the past, we have detected instances of unapproved solar panels being installed where the guidelines were not followed through. However, with 73% of STC claims now going through Solar Panel Validation (SPV), and our new solar panel serial number ledger about to be implemented, we believe this type of fraud is very close to being eliminated.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/18/free-solar-systems-to-be-given-to-south-australian-concession-holders-from-today/,"INSTALLATIONS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 18, 2021",Free solar systems to be given to South Australian concession holders from today,"The South Australian government’s $4.25 million Switch for Solar pilot program launched on Monday, offering 1000 eligible residents a free solar system to forgo their energy and Cost of Living concession payments for 10 years.
The program is designed to remove the main barrier to solar uptake – the cost of buying and installing the solar system. The state government’s modelling estimates participating households will be between $210 to $665 better off every year compared with simply receiving their allocated concession payments.
The solar systems being offered as part of the pilot are 4.4 kW and will be installed by the government’s selected partnering companies Sharpe Energy Hub and Zen Energy. The systems will be installed at no upfront cost, though a “small fee” may be payable if a non-standard installation is required, the Marshall government’s media release said.
The suburbs selected for the pilot program include Hope Valley, Banksia Park, Tea Tree Gully, Vista, Modbury, Modbury Heights, Modbury North, Felixstow, Campbelltown, Newton, Paradise, Athelstone, Dernancourt, Holden Hill, Highbury, Redwood Park and Ridgehaven and Goolwa and Hindmarsh Island in regional SA.
These areas were selected by the Department for Energy and Mining based on where the network can best accommodate the volume of solar installations.
Eligible households will need to own their home and not have an existing solar system. Naturally, they will also have to be beneficiaries of the energy and Cost of Living concession payments, which go to low income households, people on certain Centrelink payments, and those who hold an eligible concession card.
The state government said it will contact eligible concession holders in the selected suburbs directly.
South Australia concession holders can receive up to $215.10 per year from the Cost of Living Concession and up to $231.41 per year towards their energy bill as part of an energy concession, totalling up to $446.51. Swapping this payment for a decade would mean the government recovers a total of $4,460 for the solar system.
While this ultimately works out to be a fairly average price for a mid-sized solar system, the concession holder also saves money on their electricity bills, leading the government to its estimate that participating households will be up to $665 better off under the Switch for Solar program.
“Modelling shows that electricity cost savings from the free solar system will outweigh the two concessions foregone,” Minister for Energy and Mining Dan van Holst Pellekaan said.
Australian Energy Market Operator
South Australia is already flooded with solar energy, regularly plunging wholesale electricity prices below zero. In other words, utilities pay consumers to use electricity to get it out of the flooded grid. The state has also recently been subject to multiple interventions by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), which has had to order power generators to remain on even when it is unprofitable in order to stabilise the flow to electricity.
As much of a headache as this is for AEMO, it is a symptom of the state’s remarkably high solar generation. As minister van Holst Pellekaan notes, more than 56% of electricity generated in South Australia was from renewable sources last financial year. The state is aiming for net 100% renewable generation by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/18/solar-powered-ice-cream-beer-say-no-more/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"MAY 18, 2021",Solar powered ice-cream beer? Say no more,"American ice-cream giant Ben & Jerry’s and Manly’s own 4 Pines brewery have teamed up for a limited-edition Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Nitro Beer with the intention to support a community group to receive a solar installation through Enova Community Energy.
The beer is a take on Ben & Jerry’s arguably most famous flavour, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough flavour, although I’d say other contenders include New York Super Fudge Chunk and anything with peanut butter.
4 Pines, whose Brookvale brewery and headquarters is powered by energy sourced from solar and wind via a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), says the brew is a hard pour which, if you can picture something a bit close to the cascade of a Guinness, sees the nitro infusion pour down the glass in a golden brown colour like the good sun used to power it. What is more, the decadent flavour and creaminess is ideal as we head into the winter months.

Of course, Vermont’s Ben & Jerry’s has a long history of climate activism and the two companies said it was a “no brainer” to team up and use the power of the sun to create a beer, and to create the opportunity for a community group to receive a solar installation. They’re calling it the ‘good beer that gives back’.
“Ben & Jerry’s has long fought for a renewable energy future,” says Ben & Jerry’s Australia social mission manager Stephanie Curley, “and the partnership with 4 Pines provides a foundation for a sustainable solution with solar panels for the people and the planet.”
Andrew Tweddell, 4 Pines head brewer, seconded that notion, stating that “Since day dot, we’ve brewed beer that we want to drink personally and something that our mates would be proud of. Our Ben & Jerry’s-inspired brew has certainly ticked both boxes. It’s truly a good beer that gives back, and the flavour profile is nostalgic and decadent. For us, we want to leave the world in a better state than which we found it. As each year goes on, we’re working to become a sustainable and community-minded brewery that can make a difference.”
The project will see the two companies contribute to Enova’s ‘revolving community energy fund’, a fund that sees Enova use the energy savings made by a community group to pay off the solar install.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/18/harvard-scientists-unveil-solid-state-lithium-battery-that-can-be-charged-and-discharged-at-least-10000-times/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 18, 2021","Harvard scientists unveil solid-state lithium battery that can be charged and discharged at least 10,000 times","Researchers at Harvard claim to have developed a lithium-metal, solid-state battery with improved stability and increased ability to prevent lithium (Li) dendrite penetration.
“Our research shows that the solid-state battery could be fundamentally different from the commercial liquid electrolyte lithium-ion battery,” said researcher Xin Li. “By studying their fundamental thermodynamics, we can unlock superior performance and harness their abundant opportunities.”
The battery can be charged and discharged at least 10,000 times at high current density, the scientists said. Its multilayer design is described as a structure in which a less-stable electrolyte is sandwiched between more stable solid electrolytes that are able to prevent any lithium dendrite growth. This architecture was then combined with a commercial high energy density cathode material.
“Think of the battery like a BLT sandwich,” the Harvard group explained. “First comes the bread — the lithium metal anode — followed by lettuce — a coating of graphite. Next, a layer of tomatoes — the first electrolyte — and a layer of bacon — the second electrolyte. Finish it off with another layer of tomatoes and the last piece of bread — the cathode.”
The first electrolyte, which the academics designated with the chemical name Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5, or LPSCI, is more stable with lithium but subject to dendrite penetration. By contrast, the second one, dubbed Li10Ge1P2S12, or LGPS, is more immune to dendrites despite being less stable with lithium. Under this configuration, dendrites are allowed to pass through the graphite and first electrolyte but are stopped right before the second.
“The cycling performance of the lithium metal anode paired with a LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathode is very stable, with an 82 per cent capacity retention after 10,000 cycles at a 20C rate and 81.3 per cent capacity retention after 2,000 cycles at a 1.5C rate,” the academics emphasised. “Our design also enables a specific power of 110.6 kilowatts per kilogram and specific energy up to 631.1 watt hours per kilogram at the micrometre-sized cathode material level.”
The battery, according to the academics, also has self-healing properties, as it should be able to backfill holes created by the dendrites. Its creators claim it has the potential to recharge electric vehicles within 10 to 20 minutes.
The device design was described in the paper “A dynamic stability design strategy for lithium metal solid-state batteries”, published in nature.
