It has put out a tender open for those who can find an “effective” group PPA model and then lead its facilitation.
The aim is to find interested businesses and ultimately facilitate connections with renewable generators in a way that lessens the paperwork burden on the small local companies and gives them more buying power.
“Since entering our own Power Purchase Agreement and installing solar panels on our buildings, Council’s own annual electricity costs are expected to be slashed by a staggering $2.4 million over the next seven years, so not only will we reduce our carbon footprint, but these savings mean the money can be diverted back into the community for infrastructure and projects,” Northern Beaches Mayor Michael Regan said.
“There are more than 32,000 businesses on the Northern Beaches who, between them, are responsible for 38% of CO2 emissions of which around 61% is from electricity emissions.”
The Council is hoping to create an opportunity for local businesses to combine to negotiate a larger and more affordable long-term deal.
The council currently has a PPA with Iberdrola, which owns the Bodangora Wind Farm. It isn’t clear whether it would also seek to connect its business group to Iberdrola though.
Expressions of interest are currently being sought from organisations that can set up and run a PPA for our local businesses. Applications can be submitted via Tenderlink by 22 November 2022.
Council will review the submissions to determine the best model for our local businesses over the next few months.

Building on the company’s previous boring technology, the design is a purpose-built deep shaft to house compressed hydrogen – not too dissimilar from salt cavern notion.
Such a solution, Simon Currie, Energy Estate principle and co-founder, says is vital for New South Wales, since the state doesn’t have any salt caverns or depleted oil and gas, which have also been floated as a potential place for hydrogen storage.

Hydrogen storage isn’t a simple task – the molecule is small and volatile – but without it, projects like Energy Estate’s proposed Hunter Hydrogen Network simply aren’t secure investment decisions.
“The whole discussion now is basically an energy security discussion,” Currie tells pv magazine Australia. “We need to have lots of security on the production side, and we need to have lots of security along the midstream.”
In hydrogen projects, storage is especially vital because to make ammonia and other green hydrogen derivatives, you need a baseload power source so the plants can run uninterrupted 24/7. How to achieve that, Currie says, is a “both/and” scenario.
That is, you need lots of electrical storage to power the facility – be it in the form of pumped hydro, batteries, concentrated solar thermal power (CSP) – and you also need hydrogen storage so you have a “large buffer sitting on the midstream side of it.” The stored hydrogen then becomes a backstop for when variable sources like wind and solar aren’t available, and pumped hydro or batteries are depleted.
In terms of the types of storage, Currie thinks it all has a place – from iron air batteries and CSP. “We need everything.” 
And we need it – or at least need to start building it – now. In his eyes, for Energy Estate’s 30 GW portfolio and pipeline of large-scale projects to be truly viable, storage is key.

Currie is on something of a mission to “Make Australia Make Again” – donning the MAGA revision as a shirt during his panels at All Energy. His goal is to see manufacturing done in Australia, specifically renewable manufacturing. Like others, he points out that Australia missed the chance to produce the solar technology first developed at the University of New South Wales. “We lost first wave, so how does Australia catch the next wave?” 
To see this vision come together, Currie has been assembling a big base of partners and other players, saying that when it comes to buying locally manufactured products and services “we’ll always put our money where our mouth is.”
The first project Energy Estate and Abergeldie will be looking at together is the proposed 1.6 GW Hunter Hydrogen Network, or H2N – a proposal Currie describes as more of a “ecosystem” than project.

It is being jointly developed by Energy Estate and its partner Japan’s Eurus Energy – itself a joint venture between Toyota Tsusho Corporation and Tokyo Electric Power Company. H2N is in the early stages, having only completed initial scoping. Currie says the project is looking to go through feasibility and development “as soon as possible” and is hoping to deliver the operation project in the mid to late 2020s. 
The project is seeking to become Australia’s first “hydrogen valley” and will involve large-scale electrolysers in the Upper Hunter and a 120km dedicated hydrogen pipeline through the Hunter Valley.
The Hunter Valley is currently one of Australia’s major energy hubs but its future looks unsteady given its generation facilities, the coal-fired Eraring, Bayswater and Liddell Power Plants, are scheduled to close in the coming decade.

With all this energy and export infrastructure and local workforce, the region is an obvious choice – and is set to become – a major clean energy hub for NSW. The issue there, Currie says, is that for the amount of energy needed, the transmission requirements are huge. And in the populated area, there just aren’t a huge amount of options for 80 to 100 metre wide easements to get bulk electricity transported.
Thus, the proposal for a shared, dedicated hydrogen pipeline would connect the Port of Newcastle and other “strategic locations” in the Hunter.
If you look at what’s happening in Europe, Currie says, the Europe Hydrogen Backbone – a proposed network of pipelines – is getting huge momentum because “we’ve got to understand the math.”
Currently the globe transports more energy as gas than electricity, he says, “because it’s an easier transfer medium for bulk.”

Which is why in Currie’s eyes, the Hunter needs a hydrogen pipeline – common infrastructure that is big enough and ready to go when the projects come into operation. Or to use Currie’s words, it’s about building the tracks at the same time as the train.
“We have the opportunity here to develop projects where they need to be developed, not just where there was stuff in the ground,” Currie says. Oil, gas, mining projects are inextricably linked to certain locations, “but [renewable projects] can actually go and develop in Kurri Kurri, where they used to have a smelter, where they need investment.”
Currie describes the Hunter Valley as the “perfect ecosystem” for projects like H2N. “If we’ve got offshore wind, given what we want to do around clean manufacturing, then we going to be using the hydrogen in a loop – just like they are proposing in the Netherlands.”
For that to come to fruition though, infrastructure is needed first. “You need to go early with infrastructure or else nothing will be built, people won’t come. They’ll go other places in the world,” Currie says.
“If we want to be serious about replacing the coal, keeping the lights on, attracting new industry and being an exporter, then NSW needs to look at what Queensland is doing.”
In terms of who will use the hydrogen, Currie sees a lot of potential. Obviously there’s manufacturing and export, but he’s quick to point out that while ammonia export might be a component of H2N, it isn’t the sole focus.
The other obvious use for hydrogen is as a fuel ,such as e-methanol for shipping. Methanol – CH3OH – is four parts hydrogen, one part oxygen and one part carbon, and while he says the carbon component has had people running scared, the makeup holds clear advantages over, say, ammonia because it’s something we use and can produce today.
Fortescue Future Industries (FFI)
“The technology exists to do this,” he says. Liquid hydrogen isn’t something we haven’t done at scale, but methanol is. “It’s not a difficult process [to make],” Currie says, nothing there are multiple companies doing methanation.
The demand for e-methanol, Currie believes, is coming far quicker than trying to create demand for hydrogen trucks. While NSW has committed to deploying hydrogen buses, he thinks only a small portion of demand will come from the local mobility sector – though it remains a key offtake market.
Other markets, he says, include sustainable aviation fuels or SAFs and other biofuels. Customers, he says, are already demanding these products – noting the primary producer in Singapore is well over subscribed.
“We’ve clearly got a supply chain rip.”
Aviation H2
He disagrees that most of the market for hydrogen is still far away – the issue is more that we don’t have the product.
Other possible applications for Currie include high industrial heating in places where electrification doesn’t suffice. Another option is fuel cell passenger trains – something being pursued in Germany.
Energy Estate is also talking about liquid electric gas (LEG). Since lots of Hunter runs on LPG, Currie believes there is a market for bottling a propane butane substitute.
Finally, Kurri Kurri is just “down the road,” Currie says. The controversial gas peaker pushed through by the former Coalition government is something Labor says it will move ahead with but make hydrogen-ready.
“There is no transition without storage,” Currie said finally.

The 10 MW/20 MWh battery system, associated with the 109 MW Berrybank 2 wind farm in Victoria, is located at the Australian Capital Territory’s (ACT) Queanbeyan substation.
The Berrybank 2 wind farm is owned by fellow Spanish company Naturgy Energy Group though its subsidiary Global Power Generation (GPG).
Ingeteam’s director of battery energy storage systems (BESS), José Antonio Unanue, said the project was made especially complicated by restrictions posed by the pandemic.
Ultimately, however, the company supplied two power conversion systems (all-in-one electricity substations integrating battery inverters, transformers, medium voltage cells, etc.), four 2.5 MW/5 MWh battery storage containers and a control system for the entire BESS’s operational management.
Naturgy began investing in solar in the Spanish speaking world in around 2017, soon after rebranding from its original name Gas Natural Fenosa to today’s Naturgy.
The company has been steadily growing its Australian portfolio, which now includes the 125 MW Cunderdin hybrid solar-plus-storage project east of Perth in Western Australia, the 96 MW Crookwell 2 Wind Farm in NSW and the 180 MW Berrybank 1 Wind Farm in Victoria. Its Berrybank 2 Wind Farm, with which Ingeteam’s BESS is associated, is expected to reach operational status in coming months.
Naturgy has targeted an Australian renewable energy portfolio of 2.2 GW by 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/09/new-study-looks-at-sundrives-25-54-silver-free-heterojunction-solar-cell/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 9, 2022",New study looks at Sundrive’s 25.54% silver-free heterojunction solar cell,"From pv magazine Global
Sundrive revealed in September 2021 that it had achieved a record-breaking power conversion efficiency of 25.54% for a silver-free heterojunction solar cell. Now, in a new paper that was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics, scientists from Sundrive and Maxwell describe the technological innovations that made this possible.
At the time, the Australian startup said that the results, which were certified by Germany’s Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH), represented the highest efficiency ever recorded for a commercial-size silicon heterojunction (HJT) solar cell. It noted that it used large-scale production processes provided by China-based equipment manufacturer Maxwell Technologies.
“In this paper, we shared some of our recent advances about HIT solar cells, including the use of indium oxide doped with transition metal elements (IMO), that of hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc-SiOx:H) films and copperd (Cu) plating,” researcher Cao Yu told pv magazine. “IMO and nc-SiOx:H films have already been used in our customer’s production line, while Cu plating has not.”
The researchers said the IMO films used for the solar cell have a larger bandgap, higher carrier mobility and lower carrier concentration than common indium tin oxide (ITO) films. They used IMO films with an optical bandgap of about 3.88 eV and high mobility of up to 83.2 cm2/V per second to build TCO thin films that they then deposited in the cell by using direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering method at room temperature.
The research group used the nc-SiOx:H films, which have a low absorption coefficient, to improve the cell’s short-circuit density. They deposited these films through very high frequency (VHF) excited plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). “VHF-PECVD can be used to efficiently fabricate nc-SiOx :H layers with thickness of about 20 nm while maintaining high passivation quality in industrial mass production,” they said.
For the Cu plating, the academics said that they formed the surface Cu finger-busbar grids by using Sundrive Solar’s proprietary metallization process. The latter includes a mask forming step and the horizontal plating of the metal grid from an acid Cu plating electrolyte. They added that the width of the finger openings in the formed mask was about 20 μm.
For the fabrication of the solar cell, with an area of 274.5 cm2, the scientists used an n-type Czochralski (CZ) silicon wafer provided by Chinese manufacturer Longi. The wafers have a thickness of 150 μm and resistivity of 1 Ωcm. They used a wet-chemical process wafer treatment including removing of saw-damage, texturing, and cleaning.
“Approximately, 16 nm nc-SiOx:H(n) (or 6 nm a-Si:H(n)) and 8 nm a-Si:H(p) layers were deposited as carrier selective layers on front and rear surfaces, respectively,” they said. “After that, about 80 nm TCO films were sputtered on both wafer surfaces. Finally, metal finger grid contacts (Ag paste or plated Cu) were patterned on each of the surfaces.”
Measured under standard illumination condition, the cell not only showed the above-mentioned record efficiency but also a remarkable short-circuit current of 40.24 mA per square centimetre.
“These results demonstrate the feasibility of high efficiency, and most importantly, low-cost and sustainable mass production of SHJ solar cells,” the research group said.
Yu noted that the the production costs of HIT solar modules are very close to those of PERC modules.
“That means the production cost of HIT cells is a little bit higher than that of PERC cells,” Yu added. “But I think there is still a lot more to do to further reduce the cost of HIT solar cells.”
More recently, Sundrive said it had achieved an efficiency result of 26.41% on a full-size silicon heterojunction (HJT) solar cell featuring its copper-based technology. It said the improvement of the HJT cell, with a total area of 274.3 square centimetres (M6 size), had been observed in all three key performance parameters, including open-circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Isc) and fill factor (FF).

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/09/most-new-solar-panels-retain-80-production-after-30-years/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 9, 2022",Most new solar panels retain 80% production after 30 years,"From pv magazine USA
The US Department of Energy’s Sandia National Laboratories has concluded a five-year, early-life solar module degradation study that examined 834 fielded PV modules, representing 13 types from seven manufacturers in three climates.
The report, recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics, studied 23 systems in total. Six of the studied were determined to have degradation rates that will exceed panel warranty limits in the future, while 13 systems demonstrated the ability to extend their lifetime beyond 30 years. “Lifetime” in this study is defined as the amount of time a panel produces electricity above 80% of its beginning-of-life rate.
The report said that module costs have fallen by 85% since 2010 due to economies of scale, higher efficiencies in cell designs, production line automation, larger modules, and changes to bill of materials components like backsheets. It said that lower costs have led to solar becoming a central part of energy infrastructure buildout today, but noted that cost-cutting design and material changes could lead to a lowered degradation rate, which in-turn could cancel out many of the positive results of lower module costs.
The degradation study showed that degradation is highly nonlinear over time and seasonal variations are present in some module types. Mean and median degradation rate values of −0.62%/year and −0.58%/year, respectively, are consistent with rates measured for older modules.
The report said that the market share of cell types has shifted dramatically in recent years. In 2018, conventional aluminium back surface field (Al-BSF) designs dominated global solar cell production, representing up to 90%. By 2020, the market share shifted to only 15% AI-BSF and 80% high-efficiency cell concepts like passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC), passivated emitter with rear locally diffused cell (PERL), passivated emitter rear totally diffused cell (PERT), silicon heterojunction (SHJ), and tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon).
The report said there is a lack of long-term field data for these new cell and module technologies. It aimed to tackle that lack of data by studying each of these technologies in the field over time. 
Nameplate power rating differences ranged from around −3.6% to 4% with initial power stabilisation varying from −3.3% to +0.6%. Flash-over-flash measurements showed variable performance with seasonality amplifying the variations.
Overall, the degradation rates found in the work were within the values observed in the past from 1979 to 2014 module technologies for more expensive conventional PV technologies. The study concluded, although the costs declined sharply in the last decade, module degradation rates do not seem to be affected, at least for the sample investigated in the report.
