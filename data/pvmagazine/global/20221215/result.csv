Developers announced 16 PPAs with a total capacity of 1,881 MW in November. That equates to 24% more capacity than in October, which makes November the month with the highest volume of signed deals in 2022, in terms of megawatts.
The capacity increase is partly due to two contracts signed by Microsoft in Ireland (900 MW), which represent almost half of the total monthly volume. There was also activity in Germany, as EnBW signed two new PPAs for a 900 MW offshore wind farm. The composite price index for renewable PPAs increased by 7.4% month on month.
The Polish index recorded the most notable increase, at 19.4%. Portugal registered an increase of 15.5%, followed by Spain at 15.7%, due to an increase in futures prices. Germany was the only country to register a decline, with prices sliding 0.8% month on month, due to falling domestic futures prices.
“However, regulatory uncertainty increases as EU member states begin to apply the much-discussed EU revenue cap at the national level,” said Pexapark.
In November, the European Union approved new provisions to intervene in the electricity market and introduced a cap on renewables of €180/MWh. However, the proposed national revenue cap policies vary widely. The duration of many national policies is longer than that foreseen in the EU regulation, and would only apply until June 30, 2023.
Some member states have drafted complex regulations that do not calculate the actual net income, but instead focus on a generic reference market price. This approach can harm existing PPAs, as it exposes producers to the risk of being taxed on income they have not earned.
Depending on the final regulations, the short-term PPA market could be negatively affected, with declining liquidity in the futures market. Regulatory uncertainty could also complicate cross-border PPA pricing.
“Regulatory interventions make sense for consumers, but we have to keep in mind that interventions carry a higher perception of risk from an investor perspective, which translates into higher return expectations, higher costs, and, ultimately, a slower energy transition,” said Pexapark.

“The 12 V 100 Ah Smart battery is an all-in-one LiFePO4 battery specifically designed for home solar energy storage, trolling motors, RVs, and more off-grid applications,” said the Chinese battery manufacturer.
The system has a nominal voltage of 12.8 V and a capacity of 100 Ah. It measures 274 mm x 206.5 mm x 205 mm. It comes with a five-year warranty and can purportedly operate for more than 4,000 cycles.
“The low-temperature cutoff charging feature adds extra protection over the battery under freezing temperatures for a longer lifespan while allowing users to force charging for emergency use,” said LiTime.
The device features one-touch control battery (OTCB) technology. The company says this can provide turn-on and turn-off functionality, as well as sleep mode activation and low-temp force charging. It is selling the devices for $479.99.
“It is one of the rare LiFePO4 lithium batteries that support both series and parallel connections on the market, so users can have more flexibility to customize power banks of different capacities,” it said.

The group described the proposed system configuration in “Techno-economic model and feasibility assessment of green hydrogen projects based on electrolysis supplied by photovoltaic PPAs,” which was recently published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. They said that a grid-connected PV plant could sell power to the wholesale electricity market, with the hydrogen facility buying electricity at the hourly prices marked by the pool.
“Following this, the differences in price will be resolved (normally every month) between the agents to maintain the agreed price of the PPA (PPPA),” the researchers said. “This is done so that for every hour, every entity will need to issue or receive a payment to the other, which maintains the PPPA value. In particular, for the case of a financial PPA ‘as produced,’ the consumer will be obliged to purchase an agreed percentage, or all energy produced in the renewable energy plant at the fixed price PPPA to the producer with hourly matching.”
The modeling considers a financial “as produced” PPA with a “take or pay” clause. It shows that there are moments when the electricity volume purchased from a PPA can exceed the demand from an electrolysis plant, with the operator of the electrolyzer selling excess power to the spot market or other consumers. It also considers funding structures, project stakeholders, and sources of capex and opex. The hydrogen plant is assumed to be based on alkaline technology and is equipped with compression and storage equipment.
In order to validate its model, the group investigated a case study of a 10 MW solar plant in Spain supplying power to a green hydrogen plant under a 20-year PPA at a price of €0.035 ($0.037)/kWh. The electrolyzer is assumed to a nominal power of 5 MW and an overall system efficiency of 50 kWh/kg. It is also expected to sell 600 tons of hydrogen per year at a price of €6/kg.
“In order to maintain the electrolysis consumption required to produce the demanded hydrogen amount within the 72-hour time window, the consumption from PV power is prioritized while additional electricity is imported from the grid in moments when the wholesale market prices are low,” the scientists said.
The academics concluded that a reliance on PPAs raises the return rate of a solar-powered green hydrogen project. They added that increasing or even doubling the size of the electrolyzer is a key move to achieve this goal.
“Another important aspect is the negotiation of the PPA price, which is typically lower for ‘as produced’ contracts,” they explained. “For a project similar to the case study in this paper, a €5/MWh difference in the agreed PPA price may mean up to €0.13/kg.”
They said access to exemptions in network access tariffs and public funding in the form of grants to the capex could help make such a business model being viable in the future.
“The results show that PPAs are an enabling mechanism for sustaining green hydrogen projects,” they said.

Australian modular solar array manufacturer 5B has announced the successful completion of a $37.4 million Series B funding round that will drive the development of the company’s prefabricated and rapidly deployable Maverick solar systems.
The funding round attracted the support of the venture arm of global oil and gas giant bp and was co-led by existing investors AES Corp. and Sydney-headquartered investment management firm Artesian Venture Capital.
Sydney-based 5B said the capital raise will support the development of its redeployable, modular, prefabricated Maverick solar system, a PV array in which modules come preassembled onto concrete blocks that replace conventional mounting structures.
Chris McGrath, the co-founder and CEO of 5B, said the backing from bp is “a powerful validation” of the company’s technology and would allow it to fast track its international expansion strategy, which includes plans to establish a manufacturing and assembly hub in North America.
“Collaborating with bp ventures and the broader bp businesses offers us a wealth of global commercial and operational expertise,” he said. “It presents a great opportunity to deploy our 5B Maverick technology across a range of global markets.”
The company’s Maverick system is a ground-mounted solar array of up to 90 PV panels mounted on specially designed frames that can be unfolded and installed at speed. The modules are oriented in a concertina shape at a 10-degree tilt and electrically configured, allowing for rapid installation. Earlier this year, the company set a new speed record for solar deployment with 1.1 MW deployed in a single day by a crew of 10 people at AES’ Andes Solar II B solar farm in Chile’s Atacama Desert.
5B said it has more than 60 MW of its Maverick solution deployed across more than 100 sites and is planning to ramp up the roll out of its technology.
The company has already signed agreements with the developers of several major projects, including the massive 20 GW Australia-Asia PowerLink being developed by Sun Cable in the Northern Territory, but the association with bp is expected to provide even more opportunities.
Bp Ventures Principal Johnathan Stone, who will join the 5B board of directors, said the investment arm will now work with 5B to explore the best opportunities to collaborate on the deployment of the Maverick technology on future bp and clean energy joint venture Lightsource bp projects.
“5B’s innovative solar technology can deliver low-cost power generation at speed, helping to meet rising electricity demand,” Stone said. “This deal is a fantastic example of bp investing in a business that will support our renewable energy transition growth engine. And is another strand of our multi-energy vector country strategy that will support the decarbonization of energy in Australia.”
Lightsource bp, which is half-owned by UK-based solar developer Lightsource Renewable Energy, announced in 2021 that it plans to reach 25 GW of solar project capacity by 2025 and has nominated Australia as one of its key markets. Lightsource bp already has five projects in operation or under construction across the Australian states of New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria.

To reduce climate change and protect the environment, the transition from fossil-based energy to renewable energy systems is urgently needed. Policymakers, industry sectors and the general public want to see proof that photovoltaic technology really is an environmentally superior option.
In the very early years of photovoltaic technology development, when manufacturing processes were less sophisticated and device efficiencies were lower, the environmental performance was less impressive than it is today. Circulation of misinformation has sometimes resulted in a perceived lack of clarity about the environmental benefits of photovoltaic systems. The experts of IEA PVPS Task 12 are working to provide detailed and reliable assessments of the environmental performance of photovoltaic technologies through LCA. The goal of this activity is to increase the social acceptance of PV by making accurate information accessible for all.
Life-cycle assessments
Task 12, as part of the International Energy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA-PVPS), is a global leader in solar LCA. It maintains method guidelines, life-cycle inventory databases, and a fact sheet series that tracks changes in environmental performance of PV over time.
LCA is a comprehensive and transparent framework to study the environmental impacts of products and systems over their full life cycle. LCA studies are designed to quantify the environmental impacts of such products and they can enable fair and transparent comparisons amongst technologies producing the same product – in this case, generation of electricity. Task 12 uses LCA to study the environmental impacts of PV systems and applies LCA over time to track trends in its environmental performance. Task 12 LCAs quantify material and energy flows and their associated emissions from the full life cycle of PV systems, including

LCA updates
In 2020, Task 12 LCA experts published the third edition of the “Life Cycle Inventories and Life Cycle Assessments of Photovoltaic Systems” report. They put great effort into gathering and compiling data, including detailed inputs and outputs during manufacturing of cells, wafers, modules, and balance-of-system components (i.e., structural and electrical). This data was estimated from actual production lines and operating facilities. Furthermore, the report presents data to enable analyses of various types of PV installations; these included operational data of rooftop and ground-mount PV systems and country-specific PV-mixes.
A revised fact sheet has been published, with updated data from the previous LCI report, focusing on the progress achieved in reducing the environmental impact of PV systems, as well as the non-renewable energy payback time.
The scope of the study represents an average small scale residential PV system located in central Europe and it includes four PV module technologies:
At first, a closer look was taken at the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as they are of particular interest for decision makers. The researchers found that life cycle GHG emissions for PV technologies are about 45 g CO2eq per kWh generated or below (CdTe at around 25 g). This is orders of magnitude below fossil fuel generators, which can emit up to 1 kg (or, 1,000 grams) of CO2eq per kWh, as shown in this study.
An example of changes of GHG emissions from the electricity produced by a rooftop residential PV system in Switzerland, using the mono-crystalline technology, clearly shows how GHG emissions from the electricity generated has been reduced significantly from 121 g CO2 eq/kWh in 1996 to 43 g CO2 eq/kWh in 2021. There are two key reasons for this decrease; firstly, the average efficiency of crystalline silicon (c-Si) panels increased significantly at the same time from 13.6 % in 1996 to 20.0 % in 2021, and secondly, the PV industry reduced its material footprint, producing more efficient solar cells with less materials and waste.
Task 12 experts also compared the environmental impacts of 2021 PV systems to 2018 systems, based on the updated LCI data. After significant reductions in environmental impacts in the last update (2018 systems compared to previous ones), the changes in specific environmental impacts this time were relatively small, but there is still great potential for future improvements. By focusing on the supply-chain of c-Si modules, e.g. using renewable energies for the ingot manufacturing processes, the industry could further reduce the environmental impacts of PV systems.
Finally, the non-renewable energy payback time was examined, which is defined as the period required for a renewable energy system to generate the same amount of energy (in terms of non-renewable primary energy equivalent) that was used to produce the system itself. Yield optimally installed in Central Europe, all PV technologies examined in the study achieve a payback time of around 1 year (with CdTe only 0.9 years).
It is important for decision makers to be equipped with this clear and accurate information about the environmental performance of photovoltaic technologies and about the key factors such as annual yield influencing the environmental performance. IEA-PVPS Task 12 will continue to publish regular updates of its LCI data for photovoltaic systems so that the further progress can be tracked over time. Giving consumers higher confidence in the technology and its appropriate utilisation can help to increase social acceptance of PV as its role in energy markets grows.
This is the second article of a new monthly column by the IEA-PVPS program. This article was contributed by IEA PVPS Task 12 – PV Sustainability Activities. Further information on the life-cycle assessment of PV can be found in Task 12’s recent Factsheet: Environmental LCA of electricity from PV systems (2022 update).

Manufacturers are still facing huge order backlogs that need to be cleared so the chaos is likely to drag on into the first months of 2023. Also, some of the major inverter and energy storage manufacturers are already announcing price increases again – for the third or fourth time in less than 12 months.

One reason for swelling inventories is German policymakers’ announcement of various adjustments to the German renewable energy sources act (the Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz, or EEG) and to federal tax law. One thing that has given pause to investors and developers is major uncertainty about whether the government will skim off “windfall profits” that could be realized due to high prices on the electricity market. As long as there is no definitive answer as to whether this additional taxation is coming – possibly retroactively – or the potential for a cap on returns, market players will be wary. Some trust that, regardless of what happens, returns will be acceptable, while others prefer to wait and push for more planning certainty and a clear rejection of market intervention.
Complicating the matter further is the pending transposition of an EU directive by German lawmakers. The European Commission has approved the reduction of VAT in EU member states to between 0% and 5% for certain products and services related to PV installation. Germany is aiming to implement the directive as early as Jan. 1, as part of its amended annual tax act. Spearheading the push is the German finance minister, Christian Lindner, who wants a tax exemption for all PV installations with a generation capacity of up to 30 kW, on single-family homes; and up to 100 kW on multi-family homes that feed PV power directly into private or public networks. Because this power is not traded on the electricity exchange, there is no need to calculate profits. The new law would also bring the sales tax rate for parts and labor on PV systems installed on residential buildings down to zero.
Again, though, these plans have created uncertainty among installers and reluctance by consumers. Some companies are already complaining of a slump in orders, at least until after the end of the year. Installations will now be postponed into 2023 at the request of customers and projects that have already started are being delayed. Moreover, wholesalers will still be obligated to pay tax on purchased components, which means they may have to seek finance to cover the cost of the tax until they receive a refund for the prepayment, a month or two later. Financial imponderables loom, particularly in the first two months of the new year. But if we take a closer look at the timing of small-scale plant installation, these problems are quickly put into perspective.
Image: pvXchange
Even today, small PV projects often take several months to complete, if only because of supply chain disruption and limited resources among installation personnel and responsible authorities and network operators. Installers have to have a bit of a financial buffer, have good payment terms with the upstream supplier, or require certain advance payments from their customers. As long as the installer and customer have not agreed on firm performance milestones, with invoicing after each phase, the date of completion of the entire system determines the tax rate. In the case of new PV installations commissioned before the end of the year, completion before January or February is probably unrealistic in the vast majority of cases anyway, so there is no reason for end customers to delay.
Installers’ books are also likely full of old orders where at least inverters and batteries still have to be installed or where the AC side has to be completed. Once suppliers work out the kinks and gradually start shipping ordered goods, there should still be enough material and work available by the end of the year. Then, when the tax exemptions kick in next year, the installation of small-scale systems should be even more attractive for private homeowners and commercial businesses than it already is. For installers, this means preparing for the rush, and planning purchases carefully to avoid the kind of bottlenecks and surprises we saw this year.
The supply situation is still good, especially for solar panels, and prices are stable. Other components should also become more readily available, providing pandemics and war don’t throw another spanner in the works. Installers who have not yet signed contracts with suppliers for 2023should get in touch with their sales staff. Wholesalers have already submitted forecasts to manufacturers ahead of time, based on this year's experience. Interested end customers who have already made a purchase decision but have not yet placed an order would do well to get the ball rolling. Installation capacities at professional installers are tight and will remain so, which means that those who hesitate are merely postponing the date when they can start using cheap, self-generated solar power tax-free in the new year.

The TCS3200 is a programmable color light-to-frequency converter equipped with white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to illuminate an object's surface for color detection, with the object reflecting light to the sensor to determine color intensities.
“TCS3200 can detect the color of the light incident and output square waves with 50% duty cycles,” the scientists said. “Compared to other scientific instruments, this sensor is reasonably at a low cost.”
The microcontroller is the key element of the entire system, which also includes a 46 V motor driver, two 12 V DC motors, a charge controller, a rechargeable battery, a voltage regulator, and a roller brush.
“The roller brush provides a sweeping motion for cleaning the panel surfaces by spinning at a higher speed than the movement wheels,” said the research team.
The system also uses Arduino IDE software to write, compile and upload sketch codes for the system. It includes the connecting rods, the case shielding the electronic components, and the brush-driving devices.
The system can detect dirt on solar panels by measuring colors, calibrating colors, and comparing measured results with reference results.
“When the controller detects that the humidity threshold level signal has reached 80%, the motor driver will turn on to clean the solar panel,” the academics explained. “Motor A of the two DC motors in the setup moves the color sensor across the solar panel for color monitoring, while Motor B drives the cleaning robot to remove dirt.”
The group estimates annual system costs at €1.50 ($1.60) per panel, with capital and maintenance costs accounting for most of the associated costs.
“In one minute, up to 95% of the dust on the PV panel surfaces can be removed by this device,” claimed the group.
The scientists described the new cleaning system in “Solar panel surface dirt detection and removal based on Arduino color recognition,” which was recently published in MethodsX.
“The researched project is an improvement over existing systems since it eliminates many of the drawbacks, such as the need for water, manual cleaning, the need for labor,” the scientists concluded. “The system can operate for many years before requiring maintenance.”

Sono Motors GmbH, a German electric car manufacturer, has revealed that it has secured 43,000 orders for its Sion electric cars to date, contributing to potential net sales of €1 billion ($1.06 billion). However, CEO Jona Christians has acknowledged that the company still has yet to raise enough money to actually produce the solar cars.
“We failed to raise enough money. We failed to explain to investors why the Sion is truly needed and that there is a huge demand for it,” Christians said in a statement. “To make matters worse, we are living through multiple global crises, causing most investors to avoid taking risks and look toward more mature companies. They are telling us to not build the car, to restructure the company, and to lay off 70% of our people. To refund the community and to disregard the Sion and our reservation holders. But, for us, this simply can’t be an option.”
By the end of January, the Munich-based startup wants to offer customers €3,000 discounts via a dedicated “#saveSion” booking campaign, as long as they pay for their cars in advance. With full down payments, the company will reduce the price tag to €26,900.
Sono Motors first publicly presented its plans for the Sion solar electric car in 2017. It also offers photovoltaic solutions for buses, e-vans, and refrigerated vehicles. It initially aimed to start production in 2023.
However, the financial downturn has hit the share prices of many tech companies – especially mobility specialists. As a result, many potential investors have advised the company to focus on the less capital-intensive business-to-business space.

“These proposals aim to reduce domestic gas consumption, thereby lowering consumer bills and carbon emissions, improving our energy security, and preparing for the transition to low-carbon heating,” the government said, noting that the proposals focus on domestic natural gas boilers with capacities of up to 45 kW. “However, we are also seeking views on whether it is appropriate to extend these proposals to boilers sized up to 70 kW.”
Through one of the proposals, the government aims to introduce a requirement for all new domestic-scale gas boilers to be “hydrogen-ready” from 2026.
“The government’s view is that there is a strong case for the introduction of hydrogen-ready boilers as standard from this date, provided that these boilers can meet all relevant regulatory standards, that they can reach price parity with existing gas boilers if deployed market wide, and assuming that a single market-wide definition can be agreed,” said the government.
It said a gas engineer could easily convert the new boilers to operate on hydrogen. But the devices may also continue to operate on gas, if hydrogen is not economically viable.
“At this stage, there is no guarantee that any hydrogen-ready boilers will ultimately be converted to run on hydrogen gas,” the government said, adding that consumers will not face premiums on their purchases. “Based on a price promise made by industry, the government expects the upfront costs of hydrogen-ready boilers to reach price parity with those of existing natural gas boilers once they match the current levels of production.”
The British Energy Security Strategy currently aims for 10 GW of domestic hydrogen production by 2030.

Spain's Meteo for Energy offers weather forecasts and energy production models for photovoltaic, solar thermal, and wind power generation. It uses cloud cameras and satellite image predictions based on Meteosat images, as well as predictive artificial intelligence models.
The company used cloud cameras for the nowcasting of cloud transients and uses Meteosat satellite image predictions to make short-term predictions about solar radiation, in order to integrate solar production into the continuous market. Precipitation can be displayed in real time, along with the forecasting of suspended dust to prevent soiling.
AI predictive models combine weather data with other information to generate highly accurate forecasts of weather conditions and expected energy production under different conditions, to facilitate better integration into the grid.
A Meteo for Energy spokesperson told pv magazine that the company's predictive models have an accuracy of 5% to 8% normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) for 48-hour meteorological models. The satellite can reportedly increase accurary by around 12% for a window of two hours.
“Meteosat satellite images and Deep Learning play a key role in ensuring a better integration of solar energy into the electrical grid, as this type of technology allows the photovoltaic and solar thermal sector to predict the movement of the clouds to improve their operation and reduce their diversion costs,” the spokesperson said.
Meteo for Energy said the entire process offers a minute-by-minute prediction of the two main factors that affect the integration of solar energy: cloud movement and the opacity index for each image coordinate.

With Australia’s energy system rapidly transitioning from a dependency on coal-fired power generation toward a future built on renewables, researchers from ANU in Canberra have developed a “heat map” that shows the best sites that could be used for new wind or solar farms.
The high-resolution heat maps use geographic information to identify the solar and wind potential of all prospective areas close to existing or planned high-voltage transmission lines – a consideration the researchers said is much more useful than local wind and solar data alone.
Professor Andrew Blakers, from the ANU College of Engineering, Computing and Cybernetics, said access to transmission lines is the largest constraint currently for developers of renewable energy generation projects.
“Typical power lines cross dozens to hundreds of properties and require complex negotiations with many people. In contrast, solar and wind farms generally fit on one or a few properties. That usually makes an access agreement much easier to negotiate,” he said. “All of the possible sites we’ve identified are near existing and approved high-power transmission lines.”
Each local government area in Australia has been divided into different cost categories for solar and wind generation, ranging from the strongly preferred Class A to less-preferred Class E.
Blakers said the maps show the relative cost of renewable energy on each 1,000m x 1,000m parcel of land for solar farms and 250 m x 250 m parcel for wind.  The most suitable locations are highlighted in red and less preferred sites are outlined in pink or blue, while unsuitable areas, including urban areas, protected areas and native forests have been excluded from the study and are shown in green.
Users can zoom and pan across the maps, clicking on a pixel to obtain an indicative relative cost of generating solar or wind electricity (AUD/MWh) for that location. It includes the cost of energy from a solar or wind farm plus the cost of a low-voltage powerline to the nearest existing or planned high-voltage transmission lines. The tool does not include costs for environmental and geotechnical approvals, substations, etc.
Blakers said the area between Goulburn and Lithgow in New South Wales is especially suitable for new clean energy projects because it is well serviced by transmission lines and has good wind and solar resources.
“In Victoria, the Yallourn district is attractive because of good wind potential and strong existing transmission into Melbourne, plus there’s a need to replace local coal industry jobs. There’s also extensive wind potential west of Melbourne,” he said. “South Australia has excellent wind and solar potential to the east of the St Vincent and Spencer gulfs, while Queensland’s best wind and solar sites follow the coastal transmission lines north from Brisbane in areas such as Rockhampton and Mackay. Perth, on the other hand, has an abundance of suitable solar and wind sites close to transmission lines that run from the north and the south of the city.”
Tasmania has extensive wind resources along the north coast, and on King and Flinders islands and in Bass Strait, but the researchers said their development depends on the Marinus Link being constructed across Bass Strait.
ANU PhD researcher Cheng Cheng said it is hoped the heat maps project will help accelerate the development of renewable energy projects by empowering farmers, communities and local councils when negotiating with developers.
“If landowners or local councils are able to access this sort of information and collectively approach developers themselves, it could speed up the development process,” he said. “This can also assist the solar and wind farm developers by reducing the complexity and time required to gain legal access and community acceptance.”

The US Department of Energy (DoE) has announced the Foundational Agrivoltaic Research for Megawatt Scale (FARMS) funding, which has allocated $8 million for six solar energy research projects across six states and the District of Columbia.
The projects are intended to provide new economic opportunities for farmers, rural communities, and the solar industry. The funding supports agrivoltaics, defined as the co-location of solar energy generation and agricultural production, which can include traditional crops as well as livestock grazing and pollinator gardens.
“DOE’s research into agrivoltaics provides an incredible opportunity to pair solar energy generation with safe and robust crop production – ensuring rural communities reap the full economic benefits of a clean energy future,” said Jennifer M. Granholm, US Secretary of Energy. “With these exciting projects, we’re supporting sustainable agriculture and investing in the technologies that enable us to make our climate goals a reality – a win-win for our planet and hardworking farmers coast to coast.”
In the United States, less than 2% of solar energy projects are co-located with crops or pollinator habitats. NREL’s main research project on agrivoltaics, called Innovative Solar Practices Integrated with Rural Economies and Ecosystems (InSPIRE), developed a financial calculator to quantify the benefits of the practice. It also developed a list of best practices for those interested in entering the field.
Additionally, InSPIRE tracks all the active agrivoltaics site across the United States, which can be found here. The FARMS funding program goes a step further by seeking to develop replicable models for agrivoltaics that can provide new economic opportunities while potentially reducing land-use conflicts. DOE also wants to make agrivoltaic projects lower cost and easier to adopt, thus maximizing benefits for farmers, rural communities, and the solar industry.
The projects will examine multiple configurations of solar system design, crops and cultivation methods, and soil and environmental conditions. Researchers will work with agricultural extensions and develop resources to spread the best practices to farmers and communities.
The Solar and Storage Industries Institute (S12) project intends to reduce deployment barriers for large-scale agrivoltaic projects and maximize benefits for farmers, solar firms and utility cooperatives.
“Co-locating solar and farms has the potential to remedy some of the recent land issues that have threatened to undermine widespread clean energy deployment,” said David Gahl, executive director of SI2. “At the moment, agrivoltaics is a nascent market, but with the right resources and guidance this new market could take off. This project will provide a strong foundation for the growth of agrivoltaics, and we look forward to working with the Department of Energy on this important work.”
S12’s project will feature a partnership between the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Rural Electric Cooperatives Association and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). This project will examine the economic and legal issues that solar developers and farm operations must understand to make responsible investments in agrivoltaics. Partners will then produce case studies and best practices guides for solar developers, farmers and decision makers.
By selecting awardees such as S12, which have large extension networks, the DoE aims to enable more collaboration among farmers, rural communities, and the solar industry.
The six projects will conduct outreach to and engage with regional rural and farming communities, including Hispanic, Tribal, and immigrant farmers. These investments will advance diversity, equity, and inclusion, supporting President Joe Biden’s Justice40 Initiative, which is an effort to ensure that federal agencies work with states and local communities to make good on Biden’s promise that at least 40% of the overall benefits from Federal investments in climate and clean energy go to disadvantaged communities. DoE support for these projects support Biden’s goals to decarbonize the electricity sector by 2035 and achieve a net-zero emissions economy by 2050.
DoE analysis estimates that the United States will need to quadruple the amount of solar energy installed per year by 2030 to achieve the Biden-Harris Administration’s goal of a 100% clean economy by 2050.
