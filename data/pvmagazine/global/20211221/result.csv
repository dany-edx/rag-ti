The European Commission has approved, under EU state aid rules, a €900 million German scheme to support investment in the production of renewable hydrogen in non-EU countries, which will be then imported to the EU. “The scheme, called H2Global, aims at meeting the EU demand for renewable hydrogen that is expected to significantly increase in the coming years, by supporting the development of the unexploited renewable resource potential outside the EU,” wrote the commission yesterday. The ten-year project will be managed by special-purpose entity Hint.co. “This intermediary will conclude long-term purchase contracts on the supply side ([for] green hydrogen production) and short-term resale contracts on the demand side (green hydrogen usage),” said the commission. Prices will be determined via a double-auction model, where the lowest bid price for hydrogen production and the highest selling price for hydrogen consumption will each be awarded contracts.
Spanish company H2B2 Electrolysis Technologies is developing a project to generate up to 1,000kg per day of solar-powered emission-free hydrogen in California. The SoHyCal project, in Fresno County, consists of the construction, financing and operation of a renewable hydrogen production plant using polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) technology, and with a nameplate capacity of up to 3,000kg per day.
The government of Western Australia is backing its hydrogen industry with three projects set to receive support from its lead agency services. Province Resources' HyEnergy Project will harness 8 GW of solar and wind power generation capacity to produce around 550,000 tons of hydrogen per year. The Murchison Hydrogen Renewables facility will use solar and wind to produce 5.2 GW of electricity to power the production of hydrogen which will be converted into 2 million tons of green ammonia annually. It is expected InterContinental Energy's Western Green Energy Hub will use up to 50 GW of solar and wind capacity to produce up to 3.5 million tons of hydrogen or 20 million tons of green ammonia per year.
Hydrogen-powered equipment was mentioned as part of Hyundai Construction Equipment‘s plan to invest €150 million into its Ulsan production plant, in South Korea, to increase capacity by 50% to more than 15,000 machines per year. “The move will support Hyundai’s growing presence in the booming global construction equipment market while providing a manufacturing base for a new generation of electric and hydrogen-powered equipment,” the company wrote yesterday.
Sweden has shown it has the potential to become a pioneer in green steel production, according to a note released today by U.S.-owned analyst Wood Mackenzie. The Nordic nation produces 3.2% of the crude steel made in the EU and U.K. Sweden's steelmakers expected to bank on the cost reductions offered by alkaline electrolysis technology, as well as benefiting from the declining cost of renewables and rising carbon prices, according to WoodMac. “At a levelized cost of electricity at $30/MWh, wind power is a highly economical source of power generation in Sweden today,” wrote the analyst. “Further cost reductions are expected, with better financing structures for onshore wind, lower capex [capital expenditure levels] for onshore and offshore installations, technological optimization for asset management, and state support for offshore grid infrastructure.” WoodMac added, the combination of hydrogen from alkaline electrolysis and energy from onshore wind is the most cost-effective option for green crude steel production in Sweden. “Assuming a carbon price of $100/ton, green steel producers could benefit from $85/ton of carbon credits,” wrote the analyst. “Better financing models for onshore wind and 48% lower capex for alkaline technology in 2025, yield [a] steel cost of $360-390/ton in carbon price scenarios ranging between $50/ton and $150/ton.”

The investment, announced yesterday, includes the deployment of a further 200,000 metric tons of annual production capacity for polysilicon, with RMB2.43 billion (US$381 million) allocated for that purpose. Some RMB9 billion (US$1.41 billion) will be devoted to expanding silicon metal and silicone production capacity. Construction of the first, 100,000-ton phase of the project is expected to start in the first quarter of next year with completion scheduled for the second quarter of 2023.
China's National Energy Administration (NEA) has revealed PV systems with a combined generation capacity of 34.83 GW were connected to the grid from January to the end of November. The country's cumulative installed PV capacity has reached 287.47 GW, according to the NEA. New wind capacity for the first eleven months of the year was 24.7 GW, the state entity said, bringing cumulative capacity to 304.86 GW.
Manufacturer Xinyi Glass yesterday announced that, based on figures to the end of last month, this year’s net profit is likely to be HK$10.9-11.9 billion (US$1.4-1.53 billion), up from HK$6.4 billion (US$820 million) last year. The rise was partly down to an increased contribution from associated solar panel glassmaker Xinyi Solar, as well as rising construction-driven demand for float glass.
The GCL New Energy solar project development arm of polysilicon maker GCL-Poly on Sunday agreed a deal to buy natural gas from energy company Poly GCL Petroleum, whose ultimate controlling shareholders are also big stakeholders in the purchaser. Under an exclusive one-year supply deal, contingent on GCL New Energy’s plans to develop a hydrogen project in Djibouti, the purchaser would pay a maximum US$0.1335/m3 for the gas, which would come from Poly GCL Petroleum’s Ethiopian deposits. GCL New Energy would pay a US$30 million deposit to secure the arrangement, if the plan is approved. GCL’s solar park business also confirmed, on Sunday, 2 GW of the 2.9 GW of solar generation capacity it sold off this year was disposed of ahead of schedule, to generate cashflow of RMB9.3 billion. In an update to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, GCL New Energy said: “These proceeds will fully settle the debts of the domestic and overseas holding platform companies of the group” as well as funding the solar farms to be constructed in the next year. GCL said any leftover cash will be used to fund the company’s hydrogen business.

The solar plant is powering the Vinhomes Ocean Park, a complex comprising a residential area and park that was built recently in the city's outskirts.
“The solar panels were installed with a tilt angle of five degrees and the anchoring was made with deadweight block anchor[s],” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “This solution was friendly to the water body and lake bed, which has a depth of five meters, and maintained the original landscape.”
The array was built with a floating structure provided by Sungrow itself and mainstream, 182mm solar panels with a power output of 540 W each. According to the manufacturer, the project will not only power the park and local community but also offer an “attractive landscape.”
The new floating array is not the first project of this kind built in Vietnam and Sungrow said it has deployed around 125 MW of floating PV capacity in the country.
At the end of 2020, two large scale floating PV power plants, totaling 70 MW, were grid connected in the country. The two facilities, each of which have a capacity of 35 MW, were deployed on the Gia Hoet 1 and Tam Bo irrigation lakes, in the commune of Quang Thanh, located in the district of Chau Duc.
Both projects were likely developed under Vietnam's FIT scheme for solar.

Photovoltaic projects developed along railways to feed electricity directly into the traction current network are not new. German solar project developer Enerparc has built the first photovoltaic power plants in Northern Germany for this purpose. However, such projects are by no means a sure-fire success, as some technical and legal peculiarities have to be observed.
The German Center for Rail Transport Research (DZSF) at the German Federal Railway Authority has, therefore, tasked TÜV Rheinland to investigate the potential for such photovoltaic applications on and in the rail infrastructure through a 14-month research project. An interdisciplinary team of rail and solar specialists will investigate which photovoltaic applications are compatible with the rail infrastructure in order to feed solar power directly into the rail power network. In addition, it should be determined how much photovoltaics could increase the share of renewables in traction current.
“If it is possible to generate energy along the widely ramified traction current network and feed it in directly, thereby making better use of the existing infrastructure and reducing energy losses through repeated conversion and transport, the rail mode of transport could further improve its greenhouse gas balance,” explained Jürgen van der Weem, railway technology expert at TÜV Rheinland. There are various options for photovoltaics to be integrated into railways, such as in the trackbed or on noise barriers, he added. The particular challenge lies in feeding the generated solar power directly into the single-phase 15-kilovolt network.
TÜV Rheinland will implement the project in three directions. First, it wants to investigate the market potential for these projects, assess all technical aspects and components for direct feed into the traction current network and analyze existing projects.
In a second step, the German institute wants to determine the areas on and in the rail infrastructure in Germany that can be used for such applications, as well as the possible feed-in power and energy yields. For this purpose, it will rely on databases of German railway operator Deutsche Bahn as well as solar radiation maps. However, not only the direct feed into the traction current network will be considered, but also internal consumers in the railway sector that are close to the generation point.
In the third phase of the project, the TÜV Rheinland experts will establish the main requirement for PV projects connected to the railway traction network. In this context, they would be able to provide specific recommendations for the necessary adjustments to railway regulations for the integration of photovoltaic systems on and in the rail infrastructure, taking into account the direct feed-in. The project will also seek to highlight existing obstacles and restrictions and develop recommendations for their removal.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/21/carbon-air-batteries-vs-hydrogen-storage/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,JAPAN",MARIJA MAISCH,"DECEMBER 21, 2021",Carbon-air batteries vs hydrogen storage,"H2/H2O-power-to-gas-to-power systems that produce hydrogen by electrolysis and generate electricity from this hydrogen are promising large-scale electric energy storage systems for grids that are hosting ever greater share of intermittent renewables. On the flip side of the coin, such systems require complex thermal management and must be sufficiently large to improve the utilization of waste heat for higher system efficiency.
With this in mind, researchers from Japan’s Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) are proposing an alternative system: a “carbon/air secondary battery” (CASB) that uses a carbon/carbon-dioxide redox reaction with potentially higher volumetric energy density and system efficiency than those of the hydrogen energy storage systems.
The CASB system is an electric energy storage system that consists of a solid-oxide fuel and electrolysis cell (SOFC/ECs) where carbon generated via electrolysis of carbon dioxide (CO2) is oxidized with air to produce energy. The SOFC/ECs can be supplied with compressed liquefied CO2 to make up the energy storage system.
“Similar to a battery, the CASB is charged using the energy generated by the renewable sources to reduce CO2 to C. During the subsequent discharge phase, the C is oxidized to generate energy,” explains Prof. Manabu Ihara of Tokyo Tech.
The researchers tested both the energy density and charge-discharge efficiency of the system. While the energy density of the CASB is limited by the amount of carbon it can hold, they found that the CASB had a higher volumetric energy density compared to hydrogen storage systems.
In addition, for the first time, repetitive power generation (10 charge-discharge cycles) of the CASB system with Boudouard equilibrium was demonstrated without degradation. Specifically, during the charging phase, C was deposited on the electrode via the electrochemical reduction of CO2 and the reduction of CO via the Boudouard decomposition. During the discharge phase, the C was oxidized to CO and CO2 via the Boudouard gasification reaction and electrochemical oxidation respectively. The researchers found that the C utilization for energy generation of the CASB depended on the equilibrium between the three different carbon species (C, CO2, CO), also known as the “Boudouard equilibrium.”
The CASB system was able to utilize most of the carbon deposited on the electrode for energy generation, achieving maximum Coulombic efficiency of 84%, indicating that most of the stored energy can be obtained during the discharge phase. Furthermore, it demonstrated charge-discharge efficiency of 38%, and power density of 80 mW cm−2 at 800° C and 100 mA cm−2.
“Compared to hydrogen storage systems, the CASB system is expected to have a smaller system size and higher system efficiency”, says Prof. Ihara. The findings were presented in the paper “Carbon/air secondary battery system and demonstration of its charge-discharge,” published in Journal of Power Sources.

Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for 2022 look even more promising.
Described as a $32 million project in a press release issued by Globeleq in the summer, the facility was yesterday labelled a $36 million site by the lead backer of the project, which is 70% owned by the U.K.'s CDC Group – which will be rebranded British International Investment in April – and 30% owned by Norwegian state development body Norfund.
Globeleq also revealed the battery system will be supplied by the E22 business which is ultimately owned by Spanish energy company Alvealia Group.
The Cuamba project, to be constructed by around 100 workers in the Tetereane district of Niassa province, has received a $19 million loan from the Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund which is financed by the governments of the U.K., Switzerland, Sweden, Germany, and the Netherlands.
A $7 million grant provided by the Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) will subsidize the price to be paid by state-owned utility Electricidade de Moçambique for the electricity generated at the site, under a 25-year power purchase agreement. The grant will also help fund grid upgrades needed to accommodate the solar and battery system. PIDG is financed by the International Finance Corp private sector arm of the World Bank and the governments of the U.K., the Netherlands, Switzerland, Australia, Sweden, and Germany.
U.K. government-owned development body CDC Group supplied a $1 million grant to help pay for the battery system, under a viability gap funding program which supplies the backing needed to shore up the business case of projects.
Spanish company TSK will provide engineering, procurement and construction services for a site described as “Mozambique's first grid scale battery energy storage system” by Olivia Carballo, a director at the Ninety One Ltd Anglo-South African asset management business which manages the Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund.
CDC's Sarah Marchand, quoted in the press release issued by Globeleq today, said the project would be “one of sub-Saharan Africa’s first grid scale battery energy storage systems,” and Electricidade de Moçambique chairman Marcelino Gildo Alberto said Cuamba would help deliver on the Mozambique government's plan to install 200 MW of renewables generation capacity under its latest five-year plan.

The Scotland-based, Verisk-owned data company has crunched the numbers to pull up some impressive figures about the scale of European battery production facilities which are being prepared.

As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we have focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. Read about material sourcing for batteries, lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling, and contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.

However, the Can Europe secure a self-sufficient battery industry? report published by WoodMac yesterday stated a continued dependence on critical raw materials for the lithium-ion devices set to dominate the European energy storage market, will ensure the EU industry will be far from self-reliant in 2040.
The authors of the study pointed out Europe's determination not to rely on batteries made outside the bloc drove the market to invest more in battery manufacturing in 2019 and 2020 than any other global region. A second important project of common European interest designation for a battery-related project this year allocated a further €2.9 billion of EU funds to the sector, with the aim of attracting another €9 billion from private investors, WoodMac added.
With plans announced for 1.3 TWh of annual battery production capacity this decade, Europe could have the second largest battery manufacturing capacity in the world in 2030, behind China, to account for 27% of the global market and twice the anticipated level of EU demand. WoodMac pointed out that estimate is based on all the announced European projects taking shape, even though only 9% of them are already operating – 42% of those production lines are under construction and the remaining 49% are at an even earlier stage of development.
With the EU having decreed all new vehicles in the bloc must be zero-emission from 2035, it is EVs that will drive battery demand in a European market WoodMac estimates will be worth €572 billion in 2030, and €1.72 trillion a decade later.
Those big numbers, however, fail to address a raw material dependency that appears set to leave EU manufacturers at the mercy of extra-European supply chains, just as they are at present.

“The module is available in different colors, from brick red to shades of green, gold and grey, and is currently being manufactured at our 200 MW factory in Nozze di Vestone, in the northern Italian province of Brescia,” a company's spokesperson told pv magazine.
The new monocrystalline PERC module is available in three versions with nominal power of 290, 300 and 350 W, respectively. The largest product has a 72-cell design, measures 979 x 1,002 x 40 mm, and weighs 22 kg. The other two products have a 60-cell design, smaller dimensions, and weigh 20 and 19 kg, respectively.
All modules can operate with a system voltage of 1,500 V and have a power temperature coefficient of -0.39% per degree Celsius. The open-circuit voltage ranges from 39.96 and 47.95 V and the short-circuit current is between 9.40 and 9.46 A. It comes with a 25-year performance guarantee and a 20-year product warranty. The thickness of the frontal glass is 3.2 mm and the operating temperatures range from – 40 to 85 degrees Celsius.
“We are currently using from M2 to M10 solar cells with a different number of busbars,” the spokesperson went on to say. The company initially aimed at directly coloring the solar cells, but it then opted for coloring the glass. “This was cheaper by far and, with this solution, customers can choose between different RAL colors for the desired integration.”
Compared to conventional modules for rooftop installations, the new product offered by Solarday can be up to 40% more expensive. “But BIPV needs to be understood as shifting the cost of traditional building materials for a customized PV curtain wall, or colored PV modules,” the spokesperson added. “This is not expensive if we consider BIPV allows saving money on classic construction materials, adding the benefit of generating electricity with premium aesthetics.”
The company's main customers are PV product distributors that want to have Made in EU products or colored modules. “Colored panels are more and more demanded in Scandinavian countries, Germany and Switzerland,” he stated. “There are a lot of local regulations coming about integrating PV on historical neighborhoods and old districts.”

The winning bid submitted by the company was ILS 0.0858/kWh ($0.0272). For comparison, in the country's second solar-plus-storage tender, finalized in January, the final price was ILS 0.1745/kWh.
The project will also include 210 MWh of storage and is scheduled for completion in 2023. Israel’s largest operational PV plant is currently Shikun & Binui Energy's 120 MW Zeélim solar park, located near the village of the same name in the south of the country.
“The Dimona project reflects the new spirit of the last Israeli government, seriously promoting Israel's energy security and shifting to solar plus storage,” the director of Israel's Green Energy Association, Eitan Parnass, told pv magazine. “Our country will need eight more such projects to achieve national goals and detach from new natural gas power plants.”
In a separate tender for innovative PV projects, the Ministry of Finance allocated another 814 MW of solar power.
Through this procurement exercise, the Israeli authorities wanted to select several kinds of non-ground-mounted PV projects with innovative features, which it labeled “dual-use installations.” These include vertical installations, agrivoltaics, solar carports, PV arrays for motorways, and solar shades. The tender's final average price came in at ILS 0.1705 ($0.0541)/kW and the biggest winner was Israeli solar developer Prime Energy, which secured around 475 MW of the allocated capacity. 
“We are happy and excited about winning the tender, and proud to lead the move towards dual-use PV installations in the Israeli market,” Yaron Kikoz, founder and chairman of Prime Energy, told pv magazine. “We have a unique experience in dual-use constructions, the first of which was constructed on top of a cowshed in the south of Israel. We expect to divide the total quota between multiple installations all over Israel and believe the company will continue to expand its operation into Europe.”
The others winners of the tender include Doral Energy (100 MW), Zabar Solar (65 MW), YVS Renewable Energy (50 MW), Enlight Energy (30 MW) and EDF Renewables (32 MW), with other companies having secured smaller allocation quotas.
Israel supports PV through tenders for large scale projects and operates an incentive scheme for rooftop PV, offering feed-in tariffs.
In October 2020, the government approved a plan submitted by energy minister Yuval Steinitz to deploy around 15 GW more solar capacity to help raise the 2030 target for the proportion of national electricity drawn from renewables from 17% to 30%. “Our new government is strongly committed to solar and storage and is pushing for fast deployment,” Parnass further explained. “We expect a rapid solar market growth and storage implementation. Being an energy island with a successful economy and strong local market players makes it a must happen.”

Zinc-bromine flow battery maker Redflow has completed a 2 MWh battery installation at Anaergia’s Rialto Bioenergy Facility in San Bernardino County, California. The company’s largest to date, Redflow hopeful the US$1.2 million (AU$1.7 million) installation will enable its products to break into the considerable U.S. market.
The battery system is comprised of 12 x 160 kWh ‘Energy Pods’ which are clustered into four strings tied to four 125 kW Dynapower inverters. The company said each of the four battery strings have now been successfully charged and discharged and have passed critical acceptance testing criteria.
Anaergia recovers value from waste at its bioenergy facility in San Bernardino, which already has its own 2 MW biogas-fuelled cogeneration microgrid. The Redflow system will help to reduce peak energy usage between 4-9pm and maximise the microgrid’s efficiency.
The final test of the entire system will be executed next month, January 2022, when Siemens will integrate the battery into the microgrid controller and the facility can absorb the entire 2 MWh load of the energy storage system.
“This is a very significant milestone for Redflow. As our biggest single deployment system to date, Anaergia will provide a high visibility MWh reference installation for our growth into the United States and other global markets,” Redflow’s CEO and Managing Director, Tim Harris, said.
“I am delighted that we have passed this important stage. We have already had enquiries from multiple customers and Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) companies who have requested a site visit in early January,” he added.
Once Anaergia’s Rialto Bioenergy Facility is fully operational, it will be the biggest landfill diverted organic waste digester facility in North America, capable of converting 700 tonnes of organic waste from Los Angeles and Southern California daily, as well as 300 tonnes of biosolids into renewable natural gas and Class A fertiliser.

Breaking research published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society demonstrated the efficacy of what has been hailed a “wonder material”: phosphorene nanoribbons (PNR). 
The material, first produced in 2019, is comprised of ultra-thin “2D” layers that are one atom thick. Many theoretical use cases have been considered for the material, including enhancing batteries, biomedical sensors, and quantum computing. 
Now, a research team from the Imperial College of London and University College London have brought the theoretical to the actual, demonstrating the photovoltaic-boosting effect PNR brings to solar cells. When applied in tandem with a perovskite solar cell, PNR-boosted cells achieved an efficiency above 21%, putting them on par with traditional silicon cell output levels.
Perovskites are hailed for being earth-abundant, and highly alterable by scientists. Improvements in efficiency and stability are being evaluated worldwide in test laboratories to find a possible counterpart to silicon solar cells, which are tied to some supply-chain constraints and labor concerns.
PNRs directly aided the perovskite cells in “hole mobility.” In photovoltaics, the “hole” represents the partner of electrons in electric transport, so increasing hole mobility improves the speed and strength of the current between the layers of the device, improving overall efficiency.
The research team said that in addition to improving perovskite cells, the experimental validation of PNRs will also help create design rules for optoelectronics, which are devices that emit or detect light. Further experimentation will continue to modify the surface of the PNR, possibly improving the unique electronic properties of the material, said the team.
