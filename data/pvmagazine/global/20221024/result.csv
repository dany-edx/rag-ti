This emerges from new numbers released by the country's state-run Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (RVO) agency, which reveals that, if the above-mentioned numbers will be confirmed by actual deployment, all PV systems installed in the country may cover more than 12% of its electricity demand. The RVO cites examples of projects where solar is not finally deployed , such as owing to rooftop constructions found to be unsuitable for solar modules, or where new projects are not immediately connected due to grid congestion.
Moreover, the RVO reported that the installed PV capacity reached 14.4 GW at the end of 2021, when solar accounted for around 9.3% of total power demand. Most of this capacity – 8.6 GW – comes from systems exceeding 15 kW, with the remaining 5.8 GW represented by smaller installations.
Furthermore, the agency said around 3.5 GW of new PV installations were connected to the grid in the Netherlands in 2021. This exceeds by around 200 MW the data released by the Dutch Central Agency for Statistics in March, when the newly installed solar capacity was estimated at around 3.3 GW.
The SDE++ program for large scale renewables continues to be the main driver for planned and contracted PV capacity in the country.
A recent report from the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) stated that the Netherlands could reach up to 132 GW of PV by 2050.

The goal is to reduce computational costs and accelerate Volkswagen’s adoption of quantum computers to develop battery materials that are safer, lighter, and more cost-effective. According to the German car maker, the two companies want to bring resource-efficient quantum algorithms to market maturity in the next decade. The Volkswagen and Xanadu collaboration has been underway since last year and the results of the first phase of the collaboration have already been published in the journal Physical Review A. The research report highlights the first estimation of the resources required to implement a quantum algorithm for simulating a realistic cathode material, dilithium iron silicate.
Foxconn is looking to leverage its manufacturing expertise and become a major EV maker in a bid to diversify its business. The chairman of the Taiwanese tech giant, best known for assembling Apple’s iPhone, said last week the company aims to manufacture Tesla cars for the major EV maker one day. “Based on our past records for the PC and cellphone markets — we’re at about 40–45% of the overall market share. So, ambitions-wise, hopefully we are able to achieve the same kind of achievement like in the information and communications technology industry, but we will start small, which is about 5% in 2025,” chairman Liu Young-Way said. He explained that Foxconn does not want to sell EVs as its own venture, but rather be a contract manufacturer for other companies with “a lot” of EVs, which it will manufacture in Taiwan, Thailand, and the U.S., where it already purchased the Lordstown Motors factory in Ohio in a partnership with the EV startup. The company is already negotiating with other partners in Indonesia and India, he added. According to Liu, Foxconn will leverage its “48 year old roots in ICT manufacturing” to slash design times for EVs in half and reduce development costs by a third.
BMW has pledged to invest $1.7 billion to build EVs in the U.S and signed a local battery cell supply agreement with Envision AESC. The investment will include $1 billion to build out production lines at BMW’s factory in Spartanburg, South Carolina. The remaining $700 million will go toward a new high-voltage battery assembly facility in Woodruff, South Carolina. At least six fully electric BMW models will be built in the US by 2030, the car maker said. BMW has also announced a partnership with Japanese battery specialist Envision AESC, which is going to build a lithium-ion cell manufacturing plant with an annual capacity of 30 GWh, also in South Carolina. BMW says that this plant will produce newly developed round cells, specifically designed for BMW’s sixth generation EVs made in its Spartanburg plant. The new cells will have 20% higher energy density and should charge 30% faster than the high-voltage lithium-ion cells BMW is currently using. The German car maker also said it plans to cut carbon emissions from cell production by 60% via greater use of recycled raw materials and renewable energy.
Rolls-Royce has unveiled its first fully-electric motor car, the Spectre. The luxury car maker said it had developed “the most exhaustive testing programme it had ever conceived”. It has subjected the Spectre EV to a journey of more than 2.5 million kilometers, simulating more than 400 years of use. In April, the Spectre completed its winter testing close to the Artic Circle. Preliminary data shows that the Spectre is expected to have an all-electric range of 520 kilometers WLTP and offer 900 Nm of torque from its 430 kW powertrain. It is anticipated to achieve 0-60 mph in 4.4 seconds (0-100km/h in 4.5 seconds). The final phase of manufacturing known as finessing should be concluded by the second quarter of 2023, and first customer cars will be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2023, the marque said. The Spectre’s starting price stands at $413,000. Rolls-Royce confirmed that by the end of 2030 its entire product portfolio will be fully electric.
TotalEnergies and Valeo have teamed up to develop a novel EV battery cooling method. Conventional technologies don't allow for fluids to cool batteries from within, instead by means of special cooling plates or side walls, however, TotalEnergies has developed a new dielectric coolant that can be in direct contact with battery cells. Now, Valeo will bring its expertise in thermal systems “to design the best solution for integrating the coolant into the EV battery thereby optimizing performance by conditioning it to the right temperature,” it said. Valeo’s stated goal is to reduce the weight of the thermal systems used to cool vehicle batteries – reducing overall weight and boosting range.
The U.S. Department of Energy has awarded $2.8 billion in grants to 20 companies to produce EV batteries in the U.S.. The funds will support organizations that extract and process lithium, graphite and nickel, manufacture components, and demonstrate new approaches, including manufacturing components from recycled materials. Among other projects, the funding will support developing an electrode binder facility capable of supplying 45% of the anticipated domestic demand for binders for EV batteries in 2030, creating the first commercial scale domestic silicon oxide production facilities to supply anode materials for an estimated 600,000 EV batteries annually, as well as installing the first lithium iron phosphate cathode facility in the U.S. Individual project information can be found here. 
The German government has approved a plan to spend 6.3 billion euros ($6.1 billion) over three years to scale up the number of EV charging stations in the country. According to the plan, the number of charging stations should rise to 1 million by 2030 up from 70,000 now. It also aims to have 15 million EVs on the roads by 2030 from around 1.5 million now. Other measures in the government’s plan include speeding up state approvals to build charging points and providing real estate, especially along highways, where new charging stations can be built. Private EV owners will be offered subsidies to install solar PV on their rooftops so their cars can be charged overnight.

“Since January, 20 companies disclosed to expand module production totaling 380 GW, planned to be executed within the next few months or up to 1,5 years,” the analyst firm said, noting that most of this capacity relates to n-type modules produced with tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) solar cells or panels based on cells with a heterojunction (HJT) design. “Reportedly, TOPCon related expansion plans exceed 220 GW, whereas HJT is nearing the 150 GW mark. As an example, recently one HJT company conducted an online pitching and according to them almost 800 people joined that call,” it added.
So far this year, the output of polysilicon, wafers, cells and modules has already beaten the achievements of the Chinese PV industry in 2021 by some 50%. “By June, module shipments of the TOP 10 manufacturer crossed the 100 GW and by the end of September may have reached 140-150 GW (2021: 133 GW),” said the AECEA. “Just five of these top 10 have set shipment targets of between 183-205 GW.”
Furthermore, the AECEA revealed that the country's polysilicon capacity should grow from around 530,000 MT at the end of 2021 to up to 1.2 million MT in 2022, jumping to 2.5 million MT in 2023, and up to 4 million MT in 2024.
“In the near term, the overall industrial landscape won’t fundamentally change. Incumbent companies are further consolidating their market positions through backward/forward integration,” the AECEA stated. “By and large, vertical integration remains their favored business model, which in times of external supply constraints or external supply dependencies has gained ever more weight.”

“Flatbed office scanners are widely available, have typical costs in the hundreds of dollars, provide high spatial resolution, and include a built-in white light source enabling measurements across three different colors channels,” said researchers from Macquarie University and the University of New South Wales (UNSW). “Office scanners have found similar unintended uses for monitoring radiation, a range of biomedical imaging applications and for monitoring components’ physical dimensions.”
In their experiment, the researchers used a Contact Image Sensor (CIS) scanner, which works by being almost in direct contact with the object to be scanned, to monitor the spatial variation in the texture of multi-crystalline and mono-crystalline wafers prepared with varying texture conditions. Its performance was compared to that of the Loana system which is commonly utilized in the solar industry and at the research level.
The academics took measurements of several wafers with varying textures via the CIS scanner and compared them to reflection maps performed with a Loana system. “A good correlation was observed for all metrics for the multi-crystalline wafers of varying textures,” they emphasized. “This is true both when comparing between samples and when comparing spatial data across a single multi-crystalline sample.”
According to them, these results confirm that the low-cost scanner technology is suitable for monitoring polycrystalline devices, although they do not extend to monocrystalline wafers. “The reflection of the random pyramid texture caused by the alkaline texturing process is not well captured by the scanner. This is believed to occur as a result of the different physical mechanisms of texture formation and how those textures scatter light,” they also stated, referring to the monitoring of the monocrystalline devices.
“Both good qualitative agreement and statistical correlation were achieved between the scanner and industry tool for the isotropic multi-crystalline wafers,” they concluded.
They presented their findings in the paper “Determining the optical properties of solar cells using low cost scanners,” published in Scientific Reports. The research group comprised four scientists from Macquarie University and UNSW.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/24/its-time-to-bin-the-false-agriculture-vs-solar-debate/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,EUROPE,SWEDEN,UNITED KINGDOM",,"OCTOBER 24, 2022",It’s time to bin the false agriculture vs solar debate,"It is no longer contested that our collective climate goals will only be achieved through a swift and comprehensive transition to renewables. The Russian war in Ukraine has propelled Europe into an energy emergency, complicating matters and demonstrating the urgency with which the renewable transition must be approached. Only by producing vast quantities of energy domestically can countries future-proof their energy supplies, ensuring they are no longer held hostage to external geopolitical winds.
Solar energy carries little to no environmental downsides or risks and has enjoyed massive political support across the world yet, despite its obvious merits, there are signs the tide may be turning on this consensus. This is in spite of the sun being by far the most powerful and vast energy source we have; the amount of energy that hits the earth from the sun is 10,000 times higher than we need for all our power demands. At a time when households and businesses across Europe are crying out for energy security, harnessing even a fraction of the sun’s power should be a no-brainer.
For the renewable energy build-out to be realized, governments need to let private enterprizes get on with the job at hand with minimal constraints. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has published figures showing solar PV generation increased by an impressive 22% in 2021. Costs are decreasing and investment in solar systems of all sizes is increasing. Successful renewable energy companies are making huge progress across Europe – see, for example, the great strides in battery development – when unencumbered by heavy-handed governance.
Solar is cheap, fast, and infinitely available but our industry still encounters opposition to the widespread adoption of photovoltaics. The UK’s latest environment secretary, Ranil Jayawardena, has been developing plans to block solar parks on agricultural land, arguing they disrupt food production. However, ground-mounted solar panels currently cover just 0.1% of all land in the UK, according to trade body Solar Energy UK, and government plans to increase solar to meet net-zero targets are predicted to bring this up to just 0.3%: equivalent to around 0.5% of the land presently used for farming.
By contrast, according to data from the Corine Land Cover inventory maintained by the European Environment Agency, agricultural land covers 56% of the UK. Furthermore, as solar technology becomes more efficient, it will require even less space. The insinuation that solar and agriculture are in direct opposition to one another is an outdated one that undermines our shared interest in driving security across energy and food alike. Governments across the world should be looking to solar as a means of accelerating their net zero roadmaps, increasing their energy independence and, above all, supporting their citizens at a time of increasing uncertainty.
It is absolutely possible for the agriculture and solar industries to work together. In Sweden, it is common for crops that grow in near proximity to solar parks to benefit from the undisturbed flora and fauna that thrives under the solar panels, bringing biodiversity and pollination to the nearby area. Solar parks are temporary installations that cause no land damage and can easily be combined with sheep and other positive biodiversity initiatives.
As observed by Solar Energy UK in May, the promotion of biodiversity at Sawmills solar farm in Devon saw overall gains in the species of birds and invertebrates monitored at the site from 2015 to 2021. Accurate good-practice guidelines which are continually updated to reflect new research and findings will play a key role in promoting biodiversity; the most recent one by Solar Energy UK correctly notes that the agricultural land assessments already used in the UK “predate solar farm planning applications. Solar farms can remain in agricultural production throughout their operational life and are granted temporary consent.”
Furthermore, solar can, and should, be built on low-grade agricultural land of which there is plenty, ensuring there is no impact on overall food output while spurring biodiversity in nearby farmland. In future, and where necessary, larger scale solar installations can always be removed with ease if we decide to repurpose or utilize low-grade farmland in a different way than previously envisaged.
Through technological advancements such as battery storage, the solar industry's trajectory is only upward. With the correct outlook, this will present opportunities for governments to become bastions of green industry by ensuring a smooth transition from non-renewable to renewable jobs in the energy sector. In the case of solar, there are a lot of job opportunities in terms of installing solar panels, for laborers and electricians and also those involved in the logistical planning necessary when dealing with global supply chains. The skills and traits required in fossil fuel jobs are often, contrary to popular belief, vital to solar too.
The arguments for a rapid solar build-out are self-evident, much like the rebuttals to recent short-sighted opposition. In the midst of an energy crisis, our focus should be on positive steps we can take to strengthen our energy independence, not undermine it; governments should review and reduce barriers to land development, reform roofing regulations for rooftop solar, and make the interconnection process easier. The proposed EU Solar Rooftop initiative, to gradually make solar installations mandatory on new buildings, is an important step in the right direction and, we hope, will precipitate the necessary reforms from individual states.
These are long overdue yet crucial steps that can be undertaken with immediate benefits, allowing private enterprises to get on with the job at hand. More government interference is not going to boost the green transition, and might even delay energy security across Europe and beyond. Likewise, attempts to pit the solar and agricultural industries against each other are futile and counter-productive, particularly when both clearly have a shared interest in driving sustainability and should be working together. By embracing the potential of solar, we can drive new energy supplies at scale and cost, create green jobs, and ensure a cleaner, more sustainable future for all.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/24/polypropylene-absorber-to-simplify-brine-heat-pumps-adoption/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,GERMANY,WESTERN EUROPE",CORNELIA LICHNER,"OCTOBER 24, 2022",Polypropylene absorber to simplify brine heat pumps’ adoption,"Water, earth, and air – three of the four ancient Greek elements are suitable as heat sources for electric heat pumps. Depending on site conditions, installers must recommend a suitable heat pump based on the most appropriate source. German company Mefa Befestigungs- und Montagetechnik now wants to make things easier, developing absorbers that are suitable for use with all three heat sources, along with ice storage.
With a capable absorber, an installer should find themselves able to cover almost every situation with a brine heat pump. At a press conference, the company's managing partner, Martin Schneider, presented the product, which is also used to heat the company's own production site in Kupferzell in the winter and to cool it in summer.
Called multiQ, the new absorbers are made of polypropylene polymer and have almost the same configuration for uses in the ground, on rooftops, or on a facade, in combination with PV, or for ice storage and in bodies of water.
Matters of size
A ground absorber is 7m long by 1.20m high, and a few millimeters thick. Inside, a water-glycol mixture circulates in capillaries and transports the heat to the distributor and onto the heat pump. Several of these absorber blades can be buried in a narrow trench at a depth of 2.50 m to save space. Usually, no permits are required for this in Germany, except in water protection areas. As long as the air temperature is still higher than the temperature in the ground, the heat pump can also draw the ambient heat from the roof.
The absorber for PV applications is 1.20 m wide and 5 m long. However, shorter variants are also available, for example with a length of 3.50 m. “A 5m absorber weighs 27.7 kg empty and can be lifted from the scaffolding onto the roof by two people,” said Peter Kömmelt, technical manager at Mefa Energy Systems.
On pitched roofs, vertical rails are fastened with roof hooks, on which the absorber is placed horizontally. Horizontal rails can then be screwed above and below the absorber, on which most commercially available framed photovoltaic modules can then be fastened in portrait format with module clamps.
For flat roofs, Mefa offers an east-west mounting structure on which either the absorber is covered with photovoltaics or two absorbers can be stacked. When filled, the absorber weighs 44 kg and covers six square meters of the roof. Depending on the weather, the absorber produces heat from 250 W per meter square upwards.
According to Kömmelt, measurements by the company on customer systems showed an average heat output of 500 to 750 kWh per square meter from November to March in Germany. When using two sources – geothermal and ambient air – the roof absorber is used until its heat output falls below 500 W per square meter and then switches to the geothermal-absorber.
According to the company, its absorbers have passed the Solar Keymark Certification and are both UV-resistant and hail-proof. The same glycol medium flows through all multiQ absorbers and thus allows a wide variety of operating modes. Depending on the weather, a brine that is too warm can be cooled back from the roof in the ground and regenerate the soil. It is possible to air-condition the building passively using geothermal energy or to actively emit heat via the surfaces on the roof at night.
Return on investment
At the company headquarters in Kupferzell, which was newly built in 2017, the absorber is visible as a large-scale façade system on a high-bay warehouse. In addition, there are absorbers under the photovoltaic system on the roof, under the floor slab of the building and also in an ice storage facility. Together with three heat pumps, they cover the required 500 kW of heat output and 1,200,000 kWh of heat at the site.
The ice store is primarily used to cool the machines and server rooms. In summer, the offices are passively cooled and the soil is regenerated. Thanks to the sophisticated control of the cheapest source in each case, the heat pumps achieved an astounding annual performance factor of seven, according to Kömmelt from Mefa. This means that with one part of electrical energy, mostly from the roof, seven parts of heat are produced.
With its system, Mefa wants to fight against the supremacy of the easy-to-install air heat pump. A brine heat pump with geo-absorbers is quiet, completely protected from the weather and is expected to last much longer. In addition, the lower power consumption and the higher annual performance factor of the brine heat pump would compensate for the higher investment costs after just a few years, says Schneider. In the example presented of a system in a single-family house with 8 kW of heat output and 16,000 kWh of heat consumption per year, the additional investment in geo-absorbers and underground installation would have paid for itself after six years.
In the future, Mefa also wants to enter the utility-scale market. A solar farm that stands on ground absorbers and also accommodates sun absorbers under the modules can serve as a heating center for a district's local heating network. A first project is already in the planning stage.

In the country's licensing process, obtaining a grid capacity permit represents the first of a three-step process for a new solar project. The next step is an application for a generation license. Once that is successfully obtained, an exploitation license is the final step. “DGEG’s database for generation licenses includes 240 projects, 72% of which are solar,” Inês Gaspar, senior analyst at Aurora Energy Research, told pv magazine.
Data also shows that around 1.2 GW of solar projects requested generation licenses in the first seven months of 2022. For all of 2021, the figure was just over 0.9 GW. According to the cross-analysis of that database and the results of solar auctions made by Aurora, solar capacity awarded at auctions represents around 33% of the projects with a generation license. The remaining projects are mainly unsubsidized schemes, with a few in the self-consumption regime.
“Most projects of the 2019 auction have already requested generation licenses. Only six are missing, representing 446 MW,” said Gaspar. “However, only one project from the 2020 auction has requested a license so far, given that the grid will only be ready to receive them by June 2024.”
Following a decree of law established in January, the DGEG started publishing data on all generation licenses requested for electricity generation projects above 1 MW, which has added transparency to the licensing process, according to Gaspar.
After obtaining a generation license, a project undergoes a series of tests in order to receive the exploitation license, which is ultimately needed to begin commercial operations. According to Aurora’s analysis, between 2016 and 2018 a project obtained an exploitation license on average 2.9 years after the production license. That period has decreased to two years between 2019 and 2020.

Nanotech’s battery uses lithium-ion chemistry supported by graphene and a proprietary nonflammable electrolyte technology that improves the electrochemical properties and safety of its electrodes.
According to the company, graphene provides ideal electronic and mechanical support to increase the reversible capacity, power and cycling stability of standard cathodes. Nanotech produces its own graphene, which allows it to be vertically integrated.
On Thursday, the company announced it would supply more than 1 GWh of battery energy storage systems (BESS) to Athens-headquartered Smile Energy, acting as the distributor for Greece and the surrounding region with Nanotech Energy BESS products through to 2028. Greece has recently doubled its 2030 energy storage target to 3 GW.
Smile Energy will potentially use Nanotech’s products to develop BESS for private homes, commercial real estate, and the marine sector and building on its pipeline of 700 MWh of energy storage across Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania.
Battery tech
The startup uses a solution processing method that allows graphene to be coated on “any substrate” along with a laser process step that forms a graphene foam. The company had originally applied its graphene technology to making better supercapacitors, but now focuses on its “super battery.”
“Nanotech Energy is the first and only producer to break the 50% content barrier by reaching 98% monolayer graphene, the wonder material that powers our products. We've already developed groundbreaking energy storage using technology that has the high capacity of a battery and the power performance of supercapacitors in a single solution,” said Nanotech Energy CEO Jack Kavanaugh.
According to the technical data sheet for Nanotech Energy Nonflammable GOC18650A batteries, it has a cycle life of 1200 cycles before it degrades to 88%. Its gravimetric density is 215 Wh/kg, while volumetric density stands at 557 Wh/l. The operating temperature range is from -20 to 60 degrees Celsius.
In August 2021, Nanotech Energy raised $64 million in a Series D at a $550 million valuation, with total funding thus far standing at $94.9 million. The privately held company has been backed by Multiverse Investment Fund, Fubon Financial Group, and Volkswagen, among others.
Meanwhile, Nanotech has announced it is expanding its operations with a new manufacturing facility in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, Nevada. The first of two buildings planned will produce 2.5 GWh of batteries annually, with the plan to continue expansion to 15 GWh over the next several years, the company said.
The first building is slated to open in Q4 2022, and Nanotech is currently taking battery pre-orders. Limited production will kick off in 2023 with full production starting in 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/24/new-industrial-plant-concept-for-end-of-life-pv-panel-recycling/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 24, 2022",New industrial plant concept for end-of-life PV panel recycling,"Italian startup Tialpi Srl has developed a new concept for photovoltaic panel recycling plants that may reportedly help recycle at least 85% of a photovoltaic panel’s weight.
“We have developed a new technology to recover the most significant components of photovoltaic panels such as aluminium profiles, copper cables, and glass,” Vera Ramon, who is responsible for energy at Tialpi Srl, told pv magazine. “Our next step, which is the second phase of our project, will be completing the development of the processes for dividing the backsheets from the wafer of silicon, which will make it possible to recover 100% of a module’s weight. For the first phase, the company has already secured a patent while for the second the patent is still pending.”
The second phase of the project is currently under development at the company's facility in Mottalciata, in the Italian northern province of Biella. The industrial plant will recycle solar panels across several steps.
The process initially moves the panels into the line from two vertical stock containing about 25 panels each via a gripping system with pneumatic pistons that presses on the four aluminum perimeter profiles, which are then transferred through wheeled containers to the stock with a forklift. “The connector cables are cut manually with a simple scissor and the cables will be bagged manually directly into big bags on a pallet to be then transferred to the stock with forklift,” said Ramon. “Then the edges of the aluminum frame are cut by means of four miter saws operated automatically and the dust generated will be sucked up with a vacuum cleaner and bagged directly into 25 kg bags.”

In subsequent steps, the process detaches the aluminum frame by means of four pistons, then removing the electrical connectors fixed to the backsheets by cutting the silicone or other sealants using a thin semi-hardened steel blade. Machinery moves the treated panel to one of two glass detachment lines, where the glass is heated by infrared lamps and then detached via a vibrating steel blade. “The action of the vibrating knife and the detachment from the sandwich crush the glass that falls on a lifter and moves on to the next section,” explained Tialpi's Ramon. “The sandwich is conveyed to a pallet, with gradual lifting, which contains up to 500 sandwiches, for a height of about one meter and a weight of about 1,500 kg.”
After this process is completed, a rubberized cup belt transports the glass to the screening department. The purpose of the screening is to eliminate fine (<2 mm) and coarse (> 10 mm) glass elements and any sandwich residues to obtain glass sized between 2 mm and 10 mm. These two products are then bagged directly into big bags on a pallet to be then transferred to the stock with a forklift.
In order to obtain a high-quality glass, the two products must then be properly stored and optically sorted to identify and reject non-transparent particles. “After the optical sorting, the final high-quality glass with a 2-10 mm size is directly stored in a 50-ton capacity silo. From here, it is possible to load directly the trucks for final delivery to the customers,” said Ramon.
The final step consists of an offline machine that is manually fed cabling at up to 150kg/hour to treat and extract copper with 99% purity, and plastics that can be used for extrusion. The whole process, according to the company, is environmentally compatible, as it is carried out without emissions into the atmosphere and without the use of water. The recovered aluminum can be used in remelting processes for various industries such as automotive and construction, while the high-quality extra-clear glass can be utilized in the container glass and flat extra-clear glass industry.
According to its developers, the entire process has a low energy consumption of about 1kW per panel. “It is carried out with only two workers and the payback time is about two years,” the spokesperson explained.
 The company developed the special design in the frame of the “Frelp By Sun” project, which was initially funded by the European Union. The project began in 2012 with the aim of testing and developing innovative technologies for 100% recycling of end-of-life photovoltaic panels in an economically and environmentally sustainable way. The project leader was Tialpi's parent company, Sasil, a unit of Italian mining company Minerali Industriali, in partnership with glass maker Stazione Sperimentale del Vetro di Murano (SSV) and the consortium PV Cycle.

India’s Borosil Renewables (BRL) announced it acquired, through its overseas wholly-owned subsidiaries, an 86% stake in Interfloat Group, Europe’s largest solar glass manufacturer.
Interfloat Group is based in Germany and Lichtenstein and has been serving customers in the solar industry since 2008. It operates through Glasmanufaktur Brandenburg GmbH (GMB), which has a production facility near Berlin, and Liechtenstein-based Interfloat Corporation, which supplies the glass to the European market.
GMB operates a solar glass plant with a production capacity of 300 tons/day. With its acquisition, Borosil Renewables’s solar glass manufacturing capacity will grow 66% to 750 tons/day. Its total capacity should increase to 1,300 tons/day with the commissioning of a new furnace with a capacity of 550 tons/day in India over the next two months.
This acquisition will make a wider range of solar glass available to BRL's expanded customer base in Europe.
“The overseas wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company [Borosil Renewables], namely, Geosphere Glassworks GmbH and Laxman AG, have completed the acquisition of 86% stake in GMB Glasmanufaktur Brandenburg GmbH (GMB) and Interfloat Corporation (Interfloat), respectively. Consequently, both GMB and Interfloat have become step-down subsidiary companies of the company,” stated Borosil Renewables in a stock exchange filing.
“Furthermore, Borosil is committed to investing in manufacturing in Europe and will be increasing capacity at GMB’s Tschernitz plant at an appropriate time in the near future. This means that BRL and Interfloat will be able to supply significantly higher volumes of solar glass to their present and new customers by improving the serviceability as a result of the production from two locations now,” stated the company.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/24/novel-green-lithium-concept-yields-battery-grade-product-in-germany/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 24, 2022",Novel green lithium concept yields battery-grade product in Germany,"From pv magazine Australia
Australia-based Vulcan Energy announced it produced lithium hydroxide graded at 57.1%, exceeding the battery grade specification of 56.5% required from offtake customers.
Vulcan is currently working on its pilot project in Germany’s Upper Rhine Valley, one of Europe’s greatest geothermal resources. The company’s concept for producing ‘zero carbon’ lithium is to use well established geothermal energy technologies to extract the Upper Rhine’s lithium-rich brine and then use the more novel technique of lithium electrolysis to create the final lithium hydroxide product.
Since lithium – by far the globe’s most popular energy storage material – exists in an uncomfortable position where the act of getting it poorly impacts the environment, the promise of Vulcan’s ‘green lithium’ extraction has seen the company already close deals with big automakers. Eager to secure supplies for the transition from petrol to electric vehicles, in June Stellantis, which owns brands like Peugeot, Citroen, Fiat, Chrysler and Opel, announced a $76 million equity investment in Vulcan. Vulcan also has offtake agreements with the likes of LG Energy Solution, Volkswagen, Reno, and Belgian battery cathode specialist Umicore.
In terms of how the company actually produced this latest batch of high grade, low impurity lithium hydroxide, Vulcan says lithium chloride was extracted by sorbent in its pilot plant, recovered with water and sent offsite “where it was purified and concentrated by a third-party provider to prepare the lithium chloride for electrolysis to produce lithium hydroxide solution. The solution was then crystalized to produce battery grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate.”
“The embodied renewable heat within our brine means we are able to leverage sorption, a commercially proven process to extract lithium from brines that requires heat to work,” Vulcan’s Managing Director and CEO, Francis Wedin, explained. “Sorption is highly selective, which means that we can produce a very pure LiCl [lithium chloride] eluate. This in turn means we are able to use lithium electrolysis, a method of producing lithium hydroxide directly which by its nature produces a very pure product, in excess of the purity required for use in electric vehicle batteries, with minimal reagent usage.”
Vulcan’s pilot plant in Germany has been operating since April 2021, with the company now announcing it has sufficient data to complete the first phase of its definitive feasibility study, scheduled for early next year. It also began works on its containerized sorption demonstration plant in Germany. The plan is for the demonstration plant to serve as a facility to train Vulcan’s operations team in a pre-commercial setting, prior to commercial production targeted for 2025.
