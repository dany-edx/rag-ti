The government had originally planned to reduce the tariffs from July. Residential installations ranging in capacity from 1 kW to 10 kW are currently awarded tariffs of up to TWD 5.8952 ($0.20)/kWh, but that was expected to drop to TWD 5.7848.
The MoEA said the decision was driven by high raw material prices, which would have prevented more renewable energy deployment. It has also decided to grant a bonus ranging from TWD 0.0538/kWh to TWD 0.1075/kWh for large-scale solar projects that reach completion 21 months earlier than scheduled.
In addition, the Taiwanese government has revealed that the country reached a cumulative installed solar capacity of around 7.7 GW at the end of 2021, with new additions reaching 1.9 GW. The authorities aim to install 20 GW of solar by 2025, with 3 GW of rooftop PV and 17 GW of ground-mounted capacity.

The company claims the device helps to reduce the number of inverters needed in grid-connected PV installations, while providing for simultaneous high-voltage operation and low power losses.
The 2.0kV LV100 device is based on the company's latest IGBT technology and Relaxed Field of Cathode (RFC) diodes. It is designed for industrial applications that require a “middle ground” power converter between DC1500 V and 3.3 kV.
“More and more power grids that use renewable energy require increasingly higher-voltage power conversion to support DC1500 V,” said Adam Falcsik, senior product manager for power devices at Mitsubishi Electric US. “The latest industrial LV100’s 2.0kV rated withstand voltage has been developed for photovoltaic applications where conventional 1.7 kV-rated IGBTs are not sufficient for large-capacity systems and simplifies the design of DC1500 V power converters, especially for renewable-energy power sources.”
The manufacturer says its LV100 IGBT can convert electricity from solar and storage more efficiently for transmission to the grid, as it reduces overall power consumption in PV equipment.
IGBTs are based on an insulated metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) gate structure and have a similar architecture as that of power MOSFETs. They are mostly based on silicon and are commonly used in all kinds of electronic devices for switching and to amplify electronic signals. IGBTs are voltage-controlled like MOSFETs, but have also the output switching and conduction characteristics of bipolar transistors.
IGBTs are used in inverters, converters and power supplies in applications for which bipolar transistors and MOSFETs are not ideal. In fact, the former might be too expensive.
Mistubishi said mass production of the LV100 will begin in early 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/30/storing-solar-power-via-borehole-thermal-energy-storage/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,FINLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 30, 2022",Storing solar power via borehole thermal energy storage,"An international group of researchers has proposed the use of borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) to store PV electricity during warmer parts of the year in residential districts. It has designed a low-temperature hybrid energy system that can purportedly cover between 38% and 58% of district heating demand.
The proposed system configuration is applicable to locations with a high seasonal mismatches between solar radiation and heating demand. It was simulated with TRNSYS software, which is used to simulate the behavior of transient renewables systems. It was modeled via Simulink (MATLAB), in order to read the simulation results and complete the life-cycle calculation. 
The system is based on the use of PV systems, air-to-water heat pumps (AW-HPs), water-to-water heat pumps (WW-HPs), a buffer tank for short-time heat storage, and BTES for seasonal heat storage. Additional heat energy may be imported from the district heating network, when needed, as the system is not fully self-sufficient.
It uses PV electricity to power the AW-HPs and provide heat to the buffer tank.
“Once the temperature in the tank reaches the upper limit, the heat energy is discharged from the buffer tank to the BTES,” the scientists explained, noting that the discharge mode operates in the winter. “Finally, WW-HPs, connecting the BTES and buffer tank, operate during the discharge period to heat the water in the buffer tank so that the required temperature of the building heating network can be met.”
The buffer tank begins discharging the heat to the BTES for seasonal storage when the temperature is above 45 C and stops when the tank temperature drops to 30 C.
“As the system is only designed to cover some share of annual total heating demand, it is more reasonable to utilize the on-site heat energy during the high heating demand period,” the research group emphasized. “Thus, the BTES only discharges heat energy when the sum of SH and VH demand exceeds 30 kW and the outdoor air temperature is below 5 C.”

For their case, the scientists selected a residential neighborhood in Espoo, Finland. The area features 14 eight-floor residential buildings and has a total floor area of 31,100 square meters. They assumed that PV systems in the district would have a total capacity of 340 kW covering half of the available rooftop surface of around 4100 square meters. AW-HPs and WW-HPs were assumed to have capacities of 20 kW and 60 kW, respectively.
“Both AW-HPs and WW-HPs can operate in part-load conditions with a minimum part-load ratio of 10%,” the scientists said. “Both AW-HPs and WW-HPs can operate in part-load conditions with a minimum part-load ratio of 10%.”
According to the researchers, this system configuration is able to produce heat energy, without using grid electricity, with a leveleized cost of energy (LCOE) ranging from €110 ($114.9) to €184/MWh. When grid power is used, they found the LCOE may range between €108 and €201/MWh.
“As the on-site energy is produced based on PV electricity generation, the available rooftop area becomes the main limit for improvement of the system performance,” they said. “If larger PV power stations (on external structures or vertically on the walls) can be utilized to produce heat energy, Renewable Energy Fraction (REF) can be higher and the system might be more feasible.”
The academics presented the hybrid system in “System modelling and optimization of a low temperature local hybrid energy system based on solar energy for a residential district,” which was recently published in Energy Conversion and Management. The research team includes scientists from the Aalto University in Finland and Tongji University in China.
“Although the initial cost of the studied system is higher than that of district heating, the local hybrid energy system is worth further developing considering decentralizing heat energy production and reducing CO2 emissions,” they said.

Interested stakeholders can find information here.
Banque De L’Habitat is 80%-owned by Lebanese commercial banks and 20%-owned by the Lebanese government. The bank, which claims to have a social vision, also signed a memorandum of understanding with the LCEC in May about technical aspects of the scheme.
Specifically, the LCEC will compile a list of qualified PV installers across the country. According to the LCEC, there were 52 installers qualified by mid-June as part of the loan scheme. The open call to companies to join the qualification process is still ongoing. Under the terms of the agreement, the LCEC plans to visit and inspect PV systems installed via the Banque De L’Habitat loan scheme.
Pierre El Khoury, the general director and president of the LCEC board, told pv magazine that “the LCEC proposed to conduct site visits to all installations to be financed by the Banque De L’Habitat loans for various reasons. [Firstly] the expected number of visits is around 100 per month – practically doable. [Secondly] the visits would allow the LCEC technical team to double-check the work of the solar companies qualified as part of the qualification process. And most importantly, the LCEC will build a huge database of solar installations all over Lebanon.”
The bank has yet to reveal number of PV systems it plans to support or the amount of money it is dedicating to the scheme. However, El Khoury told pv magazine that both the bank and the LCEC “estimate around 100 site visits to be conducted each month.”
According to the loan process, all application requests are submitted via the bank’s online portal, which then performs an initial screening of the applications, before sending the ones that meet the necessary criteria to the LCEC. This week, El Khoury confirmed that the LCEC has already received 43 applications that passed the bank’s initial screening process. The LCEC team will now check the technical details of these projects, he said.
PV systems installed via the Banque De L’Habitat loan scheme could theoretically operate via the country’s net-metering program. However, over the last two years, Lebanon has faced an acute financial and political crisis that has also taken a toll on electricity supplies. The state-owned utility, Électricité du Liban, cannot purchase enough fuel to generate electricity at all times and power is only available for a few hours per day.
“The current dire situation of the national electricity network makes net-metering unattractive at this stage, except for the case of Électricité de Zahlé that is able to supply 24 hours of electricity,” said El Khoury.
Électricité de Zahlé is a privately owned electric utility serving Zahlé and the surrounding villages in the Beqaa region. The company can serve local households with electricity around the clock, but it has also to ration power for its larger, industrial consumers.
Lebanon also made news in May for large-scale solar systems, as the government approved 11 licenses for 165 MW of PV capacity. The licenses are part of a 180 MW solar tender that the country initiated in January 2017. However, it remains to be seen whether the international investment community trusts Lebanon’s political and economic regime enough in order to invest in the country and build the newly licensed utility-scale PV projects.

Hornsdale Power Reserve (HPR), which is owned and operated by French renewable energy giant Neoen, has been ordered to pay a AUD 900,000 fine for breaching Australian power rules.
The fine, ordered by the Federal Court, comes after the Australian Energy Regulator brought legal action against HPR. It is related to breaches of the National Electricity Rules, involving backup contingency services for the grid.
The regulator claims that between July and November 2019, HPR failed to provide contingency frequency control ancillary services (FCAS), despite making offers and receiving payment from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to be on stand-by to provide them. HPR admitted that it would have been unable to comply with its offers and provide those services during that period, despite being paid to do so.
The failure was identified when an unexpected outage at the coal-fired Kogan Creek power plant in Queensland in 2019 caused grid disturbances. The court heard that investigations after the Kogan Creek incident had revealed that the battery, also known as the Tesla big battery, had been under-delivering on promised stability services since technology provider Tesla had performed a firmware update earlier in 2019.

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has decided to dramatically simplify the process for grid interconnection.
The review of distributed energy resources (DER) projects seeking interconnection will now be based on a model of the current conditions of the grid, in a process known as “Integration Capacity Analysis (ICA),” which mirrors a process commonly known as a hosting capacity analysis. The process will replace “rules of thumb” that are often imprecise and can lead to unnecessary project reviews that are costly and time-consuming.
The CPUC said it has also removed size limits for projects eligible for being reviewed under a “fast track.” The screening process used to implement a “15% of peak load” rule-of-thumb to determine if a project requires grid upgrades to interconnect. Now, projects that do not exceed 90% of the available capacity as shown in the ICA will be able to pass the screening test. Projects that do not pass the screen will be subject to a supplemental review, but this process has also been expedited to allow more distributed resources to be interconnected.
Soft costs, or costs unrelated to physical equipment installed, can exceed 65% in the United States – much higher than most major solar markets internationally. The US Department of Energy said permitting, inspection, and interconnection costs can represent 8% of a solar project’s cost.
Delays can often lead to bad customer experiences and increased project cancellations, so this streamlined process represents a boon to solar and storage installation companies looking to boost their project pull through rate and customer satisfaction. The rules come after years of engagement in the CPUC rule-making process by organizations like the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC). The IREC said these landmark changes could serve as a model for the rest of the country to boost distributed solar and energy storage project efficiency.
In 2014, IREC began work on the Integrated Capacity Analysis, a regularly updated model on current grid conditions at various locations along the grid. In September 2020, a ruling established the intention to use ICA in the state’s interconnection process. After two years of finalizing how the process would work, it will now be integrated 45 days from the ruling, taking effect on Aug. 7.
“Today’s decision by the CPUC takes the first step toward a vastly improved interconnection process that better reflects the realities of the grid and makes it faster and easier to install the levels of clean energy that will be needed to reach California’s decarbonization goals,” said Sky Stanfield, a partner at law firm Shute, Mihaly & Weinberger. “We look forward to the commission completing this process with a future decision on the implementation of limited generation profiles.”
Further improvements to the interconnection process are pending. A “limited generation profile” approach is being considered. That approach would allow distributed resources to design a system using a generation profile to avoid system constraints that arise seasonally.
Another benefit of the ruling is the use of hosting capacity data will arm clean energy developers with greater agency to avoid costly and time-consuming processes. Developers can explore a utility’s ICA map to identify preferable locations for distributed projects where additional capacity can be added without a grid upgrade. The information on the map available to developers will be the same data used to approve interconnection of a project, meaning developers will have greater transparency and less guesswork in planning projects.
“Today’s decision reflects the culmination of years of dogged engagement by IREC to enable the use of cutting-edge approaches that simplify the interconnection process so renewable energy can be deployed faster and more affordably,” said Larry Sherwood, IREC president and CEO.

They described the cell as the first of its kind to achieve efficiencies close to 25%, while also being able to match current generation in the top and bottom cells.
“High efficiencies are possible when the band gaps of the bottom and top absorbers are varied within a certain range, with absolute optimal values at 0.94 eV for the bottom cell and ca. 1.60 eV for the top cell,” they said. “Critically, the band gap of CI(G)S can be reduced to close to 1 eV by drastically decreasing the gallium content in the composition of the material in a graded fashion along the layer.”
The scientists used CIS with a bandgap of around 1.03 eV with a low amount of gallium, and triple-cation perovskite with a bandgap of around 1.59 eV. They used an antireflective coating (ARC) to improve the light in-coupling and increase the overall photocurrent. The cell had a power conversion efficiency of 24.9%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.57 V, a short-circuit current of 21.1 mA cm–2, and a fill factor of 75.2%. The integrated photocurrents of the top and bottom cells were 20.4 mA cm–2 and 20.7 mA cm–2, respectively.
The CalLab of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) has confirmed that the cell has an efficiency of 23.5%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.59 V, a short-circuit current of 19.4 mA cm–2, and a fill factor of 75.5%.
“The high performance of our two-terminal cell is a result of the high quality of the subcells, as was apparent from independent current density-voltage curves and external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of perovskite and CIS single-junction devices, as well as an appropriate optical and electrical coupling.” the researchers said.
They described the device “Monolithic Two-Terminal Perovskite/CIS Tandem Solar Cells with Efficiency Approaching 25%,” which was recently published in ACS Energy Letters.
“Our results demonstrate the potential of perovskite/CIS TSCs as a key energy solution, in particular for applications that might require flexible and/or lightweight PV devices, and open the way for future developments that may push the performances over the 30% threshold,” the scientists said.

The company said the mobile unit can be moved and redeployed every two weeks. It takes just two hours to set up.
“We custom-designed the trailer and we have assembled the vehicle, folding solar and batteries ourselves,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The containerized solution is ideal for oil and gas fields, events, emergency power for disaster areas, agriculture, and the construction sector.”
The company used batteries provided by Germany-based Alpha ESS and 370 W solar modules supplied by Chinese manufacturer GCL System Integration Technology. The panels have a power conversion efficiency of 19.1% and temperature coefficients of -0.33% per degree Celsius. They weigh 22.2 kg and measure 1,965 mm x 992 mm x 35 mm.

The company is now testing the system in Oman, with a PV capacity of 74 kW and a storage capacity of 50 kWh. According to Enerwhere, it can enable operation of eight to 10 hours on 100% renewable energy.
“The hybrid system is currently achieving 50% renewable penetration on a 24-hour operation and is expected to increase over time,” said the spokesperson.
The mobile unit also uses an energy management system, Enlite Microgrid Control. It relies on a historic database, operational data, and machine learning to predict load curves and optimize the generation assets on site.
“We are a temporary power provider that sells the energy per kWh basis and not selling the units,” the spokesperson said. “There is no capex requirement from the client side. The solution can also be adapted to different needs and is scalable up to megawatt-sized projects.”
Enerwhere recently launched a business model for solar projects at construction sites. Its approach, which is based on short-duration power purchases agreements, involves moving mobile PV installations from one building site to another.

The project features Trina Solar's 670W Vertex PV modules.
“Construction on the facility began at the beginning of the second half of last year, and construction was finalized in early June,” a Concord New Energy spokesperson told pv magazine. “The fish ponds will continue to be used for fish and shrimp breeding after the system is connected to the grid.”
The plant is connected to the national grid. It features string inverters supplied by an undisclosed manufacturer.
“The pile foundation is about 6 meters to 7 meters, and the water surface is about 1 meter under the modules, ensuring optimal safety and reliability,” the spokesperson said. “The photovoltaic panels floating on the water can shade the fish pond, reduce water temperature, cut evaporation and effectively block strong sunlight, which significantly reduces the incidence of fish dying as a result of elevated water temperatures.”
Trina Solar claimed that its modules 670 W Vertex modules passed rigorous testing by China's Geo-Engineering Corp. (CGC).
“In the three tests of the tightened damp heat test, the PID test and the composite aging test, it took the first place, and received the CGC Reliability Award for Humid and Hot Climate,” the manufacturer said.
Trina Solar said the modules in the project were made with packaging materials with higher water resistance. This helps to more effectively isolate the corrosion of metal components such as soldering strips, string connectors, and busbars, while also reducing the PID effect.
“Under humid and hot climate conditions, the reliability of photovoltaic modules faces severe challenges,” the company said. “For example, high temperature and high humidity superimposed on UV aging are more likely to cause aging or even delamination of packaging materials, reducing the insulation resistance of modules and increasing electrical safety risks.”

The Indian state of Karnataka will host India’s first fractionally owned, ground-mount solar power plant. Bengaluru-based Pyse is financing the 5 MW open-access solar project through its investment platform, which allows retail investors to own stakes in PV assets. The plant will supply electricity to commercial and industrial (C&I) customers in Karnataka.
“By owning the asset, these retail investors can make fixed income out of the plant’s generated revenue while also offsetting their personal carbon footprint,” Pyse co-founder Kaustubh Padakannaya told pv magazine. “The ground-mount project is expected to offset 6.5 million kg of CO2 every year for the next 25 years. And our investors have already offset close to 1.6 million kg of carbon.”
Pyse has previously focused on decentralized rooftop projects through its 4,000-plus retail investors. However, the latest 5 MW project is its first venture into the ground-mount open-access space.
Padakannaya said Dexler Energy is installing the project as the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. It will also provide operations and maintenance support for the entire plant. The project is under development and will likely be commissioned in July.

It said the network will have an initial capacity of 10 GW and its construction will require an investment of approximately €1.5 billion.
“The national hydrogen network must be ready in 2027 and will consist of 85% recycled natural gas pipes, supplemented by new pipes,” it said. “A major advantage of this is that the costs will be a factor of four lower than if entirely new pipelines were laid.”
The development of the first pipelines will likely start after the summer and regions with strong hydrogen development, such as Rotterdam and Groningen, will be prioritized.
“The interconnected national infrastructure will not only link our ports and industrial clusters with each other and with hydrogen storage locations, but also with our neighbouring countries,” said Gasunie CEO Han Fennema.

The first parts of the network will be built in the northern Netherlands. They will eventually be linked with assets in northern Germany, with initial operations scheduled for 2025.
“In the field of hydrogen, we have gained experience with the underground pipeline that we converted to hydrogen three years ago in Zeeuws-Vlaanderen,” said Fennema, in reference to a 12-kilometer hydrogen pipeline that Gasuine built on existing gas infrastructure in 2018.
In April, Gasunie, Rotterdam-based bulk products supplier HES International (HES) and Dutch storage specialist Vopak signed a deal to jointly develop an import terminal for green ammonia as a hydrogen carrier.
“The terminal will operate on the Maasvlakte under the name ACE Terminal and will be operational from 2026,” the company said at the time.
Dutch transmission system operator Enexis, Gasunie, and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij BV (NAM) began considering the use of excess solar power generation capacity in the northeastern Netherlands for hydrogen production in late 2019.
