Past research has shown that LOM can lead to higher OER activity than the conventional adsorbate evolving mechanism (AEM). It minimizes the thermodynamically required overpotential. The lattice of an oxide catalyst used for oxidation reactions can act as a reservoir for oxygen. “The controlled reduction of the synthetic intermediates allowed for the formation of amorphous BM/BiFeOxHy with abundant lattice vacancies,” the researchers said in a recent study in Applied Catalysis B: Environmental. “The BM/BiFeOxHy electrode had low overpotentials of 232 mV and 359 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm2 and 1000 mA cm2.” The scientists  also validated the long-term stability of the catalysts, and attributed the stability to the hybridization of Bi/Fe-O, resulting in catalytic stability for up to 1,000 hours at a current density of 1,000 mA cm-2, without the dissolution of Fe atoms.

“The concept is to store excess solar power for households in form of warm water,” Solyx Energy co-founder Emma Snaak told pv magazine, noting that the technology can be paired with PV modules and water heaters of any brand and capacity, but most effectively with single-phase inverters.
The solution consists of two components. A  sensor with a measuring clamp attaches to the household’s grid connection – usually an electricity meter – and the Solar iBoost controller. The clamp attaches to the power line one wants to measure. It detects the direction the electricity is flowing in, and continually measures the amount of excess PV power that is sent to the grid. The sensor, powered by two AA batteries, then communicates that value to the Solar iBoost, wirelessly via radio waves with an indoor range of 1 meter to 30 meters.
“The sensor measures the net exported solar power. That is essential to understanding how the solution works. It is not just taking into account how much solar is being generated, but it also takes into account the consumption of the house,” explained Snaak.
The Solar iBoost is connected to an electric water heater. It has a voltage range of 220 V to 240 V, a maximum load of 3 kW, and weighs 1.36 kg. The controller regulates the amount of energy fed into the water heater to the exact value measured by the sensor. This way, no export of solar power onto the grid takes place.
Solyx has partnered with UK-based Marlec, the manufacturer of the Solar iBoost. “This product is the second version [of the Solar iBoost], the first version has been on the market longer. Solyx has been providing Marlec with inputs and requirements for fitting the product to the EU,” said Snaak .
“Water tanks are usually switched on or off,” she continued. The Solar iBoost modulates the energy fed into the water heater to match varying solar production and household electricity consumption. The purported advantage is that water can start being heated with as little as 100 W of power, in comparison with the usual 2 kW to 3 kW, according to Snaak.
“The water is heated only with the excess PV power, which varies throughout the day,” she said. “If there is less sun, or you are using your vacuum cleaner, it will heat a little less. If there’s a lot of sun or appliances aren’t in use, it will heat a lot more.”
The device maximizes solar self-consumption and, at €595 ($638) including value-added tax (VAT), it is a cheaper alternative to most batteries or heat pumps. Solyx Energy predicts average savings of €338 a year for Dutch households. The solution can be used alongside energy storage and heat pumps for home heating, but not with heat pump boilers. Snaak argues the Solar iBoost is a better match with solar PV than heat pumps.
“Heat pumps are very efficient when constantly on and delivering a little bit of heat the entire day. If you just have excess power right now and you want to use it, heat pumps aren’t very efficient,” she claimed. “With the electric heater and the Solar iBoost, you can switch on when you have peaks in your solar, or turn it off when you have loads. That balancing act you can do throughout the day is I think really interesting with emerging trends like flexible energy tariffs.”
The product currently does not offer the option to switch on or off according to the most profitable tariff, but it has the potential to do so in the future. Solyx currently only offers the product in the Netherlands and Belgium, but it says it will consider expanding to the rest of Europe and other world markets after consolidating its presence in the two countries.

Sydney-based prefabricated solar array manufacturer 5B has been appointed as the solar technology provider for a 16 MWp PV system that will form part of a 95 MW hybrid power station being developed by remote power generation specialist Zenith Energy to help meet the energy demands of the Kathleen Valley Lithium Project.
Zenith will construct the 95 MW hybrid power station on a build, own, operate basis at the Kathleen Valley project site near Leinster, about 680 kilometres northeast of Perth. The facility will comprise a 16 MWp solar plant, 30 MW of wind capacity, and a 17 MW/19 MWh battery energy storage system. It will also include 27 MW of gas generation and 5 MW of diesel standby generation.
With a combined 46 MW of generation capacity and 17 MW of battery energy storage, the hybrid power station is expected to have the largest off-grid renewable capacity of any mining project in Australia.
The solar component will comprise 342 of 5B’s flagship modular Maverick solar systems, a PV array in which modules come preassembled onto concrete blocks that replace conventional mounting structures.
Zenith Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Hamish Moffat said the technology had been an integral part of the company’s project bid and was selected in part because it can be unfolded and installed at speed.
“5B has demonstrated that it has the potential to get the Kathleen Valley site to full solar PV generation capacity three months ahead of conventional single access tracker solutions with the potential to save more than 60% of the man hours required on site,” he said. “This is creating a faster pathway to market for solar PV renewable energy generation assets.”
The first of the Maverick solar systems is expected to be deployed in June 2023, and will be in place before the first production at Kathleen Valley.
Liontown Resources, which has signed binding offtake agreements for 90% of the Kathleen Valley project’s initial planned output, aims to start mining later this year with first production of spodumene concentrate from mid-2024.
Once the project is in operation it will be powered by at least 60% on-site renewables generated through wind and solar coupled to the battery energy storage system.
“It is great to see a green field mining operation incorporating renewable energy from the outset,” 5B Deputy Chief Executive Nicole Kuepper-Russell said.
The Kathleen Valley supply contract builds on an Ecosystem Framework Agreement-Deployment that 5B and Zenith signed in 2022 which formalised an agreement to deploy the Maverick system at a series of mine sites across Australia.
“We are incredibly fortunate to have Zenith Energy as an integration partner who is leveraging the prefabrication and rapid deployment of our solar technology to help mining companies and heavy industry transition to clean energy,” said Kuepper-Russell.
The AUD 545 million ($377.6 million) Kathleen Valley project is expected to initially produce about 500,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate – a critical mineral used in the production of lithium-ion batteries – per annum, but Liontown hopes to expand production to 700,000 tons by 2029.

“The project will improve the power generation capacity and efficiency of Nawec’s transmission network in order to increase access to electricity for socio-economic development,” the utility said in a statement. “This is in line with the National Development Plan and The Gambia Electricity Sector Roadmap among other national policies.”
The World Bank and the European Investment Bank (EIB) are financially backing the installation under the Gambia Electricity Restoration and Modernization Project (GERMP). Upon completion, the facility will be the first ground-mounted solar plant to be operational in the Gambia. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the country had just 2 MW of installed solar capacity at the end of 2021.
The Gambian electricity network mainly consists of minigrids that the government hopes to improve by transforming into hybrid mini-grids, integrated with renewable energy generation capacity. With an electricity access rate of just 35%, Gambia introduced the Renewable Energy Act to promote clean energy in 2013.

Coal, oil, and gas not only fueled hundreds of years of industry but formed many of the building blocks of modern society. During the past year, however, the world has once again been reminded of the inherent geopolitical and economic instability in an energy system based on fossil fuels. But as a result the transformation in the global energy landscape has significantly accelerated.
Policymakers are rapidly updating and adapting their energy strategies in light of the present challenges. Global ambitions for solar and wind power deployment, alongside grid-scale energy storage, are rising as countries look to lock in their long-term energy security and restrain record high energy prices, all while achieving critical decarbonization goals.
To achieve net zero, the world must deploy renewables and energy storage faster and at greater scale than has ever been seen before. This cannot be a case of advancement at any cost, however. The global energy transition presents us with a vital opportunity to reshape our societies in a more just way.
A just transition seeks to offer the benefits of clean energy to all, with no one left behind. A low-carbon energy system, underpinned by renewables generation and grid-scale batteries – and supported by appropriate policy and investment decisions – will lead to lower long term energy prices, cleaner air, and a huge reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Done right, this new energy system will create tremendous economic growth and employment opportunities, with those benefits accessible to individuals whose livelihood it threatens, such as workers in the fossil fuel industry, and to communities which disproportionately bear the brunt of the climate crisis.
Invinity recently delivered a vanadium flow battery to a fire station run by the Soboba Band, or tribe, of Luiseño Native Americans in Southern California. The battery will be coupled with solar panels, and will store excess energy produced at times of low demand to release it when the power is most valuable. The system will also provide back-up when power outages caused by wildfires hamper the ability to provide emergency services to the local community.
Energy storage systems are the key to enabling a fully renewables-powered future. By offering a solution to the inherent intermittency of wind and solar power generation, energy storage delivers low-cost, low-carbon energy on-demand for families, businesses, and grid operators around the world.
Lithium-ion batteries have dominated the market to date. Designed primarily to correct occasional deviations in network frequency and fill short-term supply gaps, the technology has done an excellent job, so far, of proving the value batteries can provide as part of our electricity system.
Yet lithium batteries have inherent challenges when used in this manner, limiting the role they can play in a just transition. Currently only 5% recyclable, lithium-ion batteries are expected to generate two million metric tons of waste by 2030. There are also a host of issues surrounding the lithium-ion supply chain, including the use of “conflict minerals” such as cobalt.
To shift to a more sustainable economy that incorporates just transition principles we must look beyond lithium as a “one-size-fits-all” option, and look to a more diverse group of battery technologies to store and deliver clean power on demand.
Vanadium flow batteries (VFBs) are already established as a leading alternative to lithium-ion devices for stationary energy storage projects. A type of long duration energy storage (LDES) capable of providing from two to more than 10 hours of energy on demand, VFBs are gaining significant attention for their unparalleled ability to store and deliver power on an industrial scale. VFBs do this using vanadium, a metal produced around the world and used primarily to harden steel.
Unlike lithium-ion batteries, VFBs are highly recyclable and do not degrade with use, lasting 25 years or more even with heavy daily use. Vanadium is readily available and can be either mined or recovered from industrial waste. VFBs are also a safe choice as they are fundamentally non-flammable.
Invinity has already deployed VFBs at more than 50 sites across the world, and the installed capacity of its batteries is set to more than double this year in response to growing demand for the technology as its capabilities are proven over and over again in global renewable power and standalone battery projects.
The increasing global deployment of renewables and energy storage technology, supported by significant policy intervention and investment in the UK, EU, North America, and Australia in recent years, is certainly cause for celebration. But we must keep just transition principles at the front of our mind as we drive towards a low-carbon future.
By broadening policy – both globally and at a national level – which supports the deployment of a diverse set of cost effective and sustainable energy storage solutions, we can avoid a path to a dependency which, left unchecked, could massively curtail the long-term benefits of the sustainable energy transition and threaten the ultimate goal of reaching net-zero with no one left behind.

New Zealand government-owned Genesis Energy and renewables developer FRV Australia have announced plans for a 52 MW solar farm near Lauriston, on the South Island. The installation will be the country's first large-scale solar farm.
The 90-hectare Lauriston solar farm, purchased from UK developer Hive Energy, already has advanced grid-connection approvals, with the companies saying it is ready for panel installation to begin in 2023. The project will hold approximately 80,000 solar panels and is set to generate around 80 GWh per year. Farmland sheep grazing will be reintroduced at the site upon the project's completion by 2024.
Solar in is still very much in its infancy in the country, which gets most of its renewables from geothermal, wind and hydroelectric generation plants. These sources account for roughly 80% of the country’s electricity, and 40% of its total primary energy use.
While New Zealand is yet to put a utility-scale solar farm into operation, there have been a number of recent announcements for projects in development, including plans for a 400 MW solar farm from Todd Generation, and a 147 MW solar farm from UK-based Harmony Energy, both on the country’s North Island. Likewise, Lightsource bp and German investment manager Aquila Capital are looking to develop portfolios in New Zealand.
“There have been lots of solar announcements,” says Tracey Hickman, interim chief executive at Genesis. “But not many have the land, consents and grid connections in place.”
It is for its experience in developing utility-scale solar projects that Genesis Energy has teamed up with FRV Australia, the antipodean arm of Fotowatio Renewable Ventures, which has been owned by Saudi Arabia’s Abdul Latif Jameel Energy since 2015. The FRV Australia arm is today jointly owned by Abdul Latif Jameel Energy and Canada’s Omers Infrastructure.#
The joint venture was announced in 2021 and sees Genesis Energy take a 60% stake while FRV Australia controls the remaining 40%. Having delivered a reported 800 MW of solar projects, including approximately 250 MW under construction, FRV Australia said at the time it was ready to expand its regional activities to the New Zealand market.
Together, the pair plan to deliver 500 MW of solar capacity in New Zealand over the next five years.
“FRV Australia and Genesis have developed a very promising pipeline of solar projects expected to be delivered in the coming years,” said Carlo Frigerio, managing director for FRV Australia. “Lauriston solar farm complements our own pipeline and is poised to be the first large scale solar farm reaching operational stage in the country.”
More broadly, the Lauriston solar farm is part a program from Genesis Energy that aims to displace 2,650 GWh of thermal generation with new renewable power by 2030.

The US microgrid market reached 10 GW in the third quarter of 2022, with more than 7 GW in operation and the rest in planning or construction stages, according to latest analysis from Wood Mackenzie’s Grid Edge Service.
Microgrids are groups of distributed energy resources, such as solar modules on a home, connected to a battery system, that can disconnect from the grid and operate independently during a power outage.
“Despite the global COVID-19 pandemic and associated macroeconomic challenges causing a two-year slowdown in the US, the microgrid market is developing at a rapid pace and 2022 is on track to be a record year for installations and scheduled pipelines,” said Elham Akhavan, senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie.
Akhavan noted that microgrids are installed across various customer segments, with commercial and industrial leading the way. Microgrids are embraced in industries such as department stores and manufacturing, “indicating a rise in demand for an uninterrupted service,” he said, adding that the government sector takes second place, followed closely by residential and education sectors.
Military microgrid installations will likely grow as a result of the US Army’s resiliency goal to install a microgrid on every installation by 2035. These will include renewable generation and large-scale battery storage, with the goal being able to “self-sustain its critical missions” on all Army installations by 2040.

Enel CEO Francesco Starace made the statement on the sidelines of an event to promote the factory in Catania. He did not reveal any additional details about the deal.
In December, Italian media outlet Milano Finanza reported that Enel had asked investment firm Rothschild to seek potential investors for the sale of a 50% stake in 3Sun, which owns the factory. The article also cited London-based renewable energy merchant bank NextEnergy Capital as one of the potential investors.
Italian Environment Minister Gilberto Pichetto Fratin and Ditte Juul Jørgensen, the director general for energy in the European Commission, were among the officials who attended an event at the factory this week.
“With 3Sun, we are practically demonstrating that in Italy, and therefore also in Europe, thanks to an innovative technology, we can now produce state-of-the-art photovoltaic panels that are competitive in international markets,” Starace said.
The total investment in the new module factory will reach €600 million ($644.4 million), with the European Union and the Italian government contributing up to €188 million to the TANGO (iTaliAN pv Giga factOry) project. Enel Green Power will initially target the European market, where it is required to sell up to 60% of its products, due to conditions related to the aforementioned EU funding.
Enel Green Power started building the factory in May, with completion scheduled by this summer. An operational capacity of 400 MW will be available for production from September. When it reaches full capacity utilization of 3 GW in 2024, the factory will host five 600 MW module assembly lines.
Currently, there are more 200 people working at 3Sun. This number will expand to about 900 people in total.
The Gigafactory will not only increase direct employment, but it will also generate a total of 1,000 indirect jobs, including current ones, by 2024, according to the company.
The solar cell production unit will be located at the same industrial site, in an adjacent building hosting the 200 MW multi-junction, thin-film silicon PV module lines that Enel Green Power replaced with a 200 MW heterojunction pilot production line in 2017. The cell production capacity will increase to 400 MW in September 2023 and 3,000 MW by July 2024.
The company is betting on n-type heterojunction (HJT) cell with an efficiency of 25.5%. It said this could result in module efficiencies above 24%. From 2026, Enel plans to offer even more efficient solar modules based on tandem silicon-perovskite cells. The final products will reportedly reach efficiencies of around 30%.

Solarnative has invested in its first production line with surface-mount technology (SMT) at its solar microinverter factory in Hofheim am Taunus, Germany.
The Frankfurt-based startup said that it will ramp up production of the high-frequency microinverters from May 2023. Additional investments in production capacity are expected for the third and fourth quarters. The factory will expand to more than 1 GW of capacity within the first few years of operation.
Juki Automation Systems will build the production line. Solarnative will produce microinverters for its Smart Energy Home solution at the facility. The modular plug-and-play system will be designed to ensure maximum yield and security at the same cost as conventional PV systems.
According to the company’s website, the heart of the system is the “Power Stick microinverter,” which controls each module individually. The inverters are connected to single-phase strings with pre-assembled cables, while the last inverter is sealed with an end cap.
The latest edition of pv magazine, due out tomorrow, is devoted entirely to energy storage, with topics ranging from how battery suppliers can avoid supply-chain related policy risks, to the plans Russia hatched to be a hydrogen superpower – before it invaded Ukraine.
The inverters are connected in parallel, with each one supplying 230 V at 50 Hz or 60 Hz. Each string with up to 20 Amp or 4.6 Kw of power is connected to a smart gateway that communicates with the company's cloud server.

Buoyed by the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and statewide requests for proposals for renewable energy, EIA researchers predict that US project developers will deploy up to 29.1 GW of solar and up to 9.4 GW of energy storage. This represents 70% of the 54.5 GW of new US generating capacity set to enter the grid this year.
In the EIA’s latest Monthly Update to Annual Electric Generator Report (EIA-860M), following delayed 2022 utility-scale solar projects due to trade issues from the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), the solar market is forecast to rebound this year with 29.1 GW of new installations. If all the new capacity goes online as planned, 2023 will have the most new utility-scale solar capacity added in a single year – more than doubling the current record of 13.4 GW deployed in 2021, says the EIA.
US utility-scale solar capacity has been rising rapidly since 2010. Despite its upward trend over the past decade, additions of utility-scale solar capacity declined by 23% in 2022 compared with 2021. This decline in solar capacity additions was the result of the UFLPA trade issues amid broader supply chain disruptions and other pandemic-related challenges.
In 2023, the EIA forecasts the largest new solar development queues to come from Texas (7.7 GW) and California (4.2 GW), which together account for 41% of new planned capacity.
Energy storage development has grown rapidly over the last few years, with that market currently eligible to start receiving its own 30% standalone storage investment tax credit under the IRA guidelines. In 2023, US battery capacity will likely more than double, according to EIA estimates. Developers have reported plans to add 9.4 GW of battery storage to the existing 8.8 GW of battery storage capacity accounted in recent years, the EIA reports.
Energy storage is rapidly increasing as paired with utility solar and wind projects. Batteries can store excess electricity from wind and solar generators for later use based on daily intermittent patterns from wind and solar generation. In 2023, the EIA expects 71% of the new storage capacity to also come from California and Texas, states with significant solar and wind resources. Arizona Public Service and Florida Power & Light, a NextEra Energy utility, are two of the largest offtake parties of storage for the year ahead, with battery systems ranging from 16 MW to 50 MW per project, while AES and Hawaiian Electric are procuring energy storage systems of 30 MW and 36 MW, respectively.
