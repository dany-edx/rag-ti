France's Ministry of Ecological Transition has reported that around 2,229 MW of new PV systems were connected to the French grid in the January-September period. In the same period a year earlier, the country added 1,923 MW of new PV capacity. Full-year installations hit 2.4 GW of new solar in 2022.
In the third quarter of this year, 803 MW of new PV systems were deployed in the country, which compares to 699 MW in the same period a year earlier. France reached 19.0 GW of cumulative installed PV capacity at the end of September 2023.
The regions of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, and Grand Est accounted for 68% of all newly connected capacity in the first nine months of this year. They are the regions with the highest installed capacity, representing more than 72% of all cumulative power connected in France by the end of June.
The aggregate capacity of queued solar projects with grid-connection requests, meanwhile, has increased by 27% since the start of this year to 21.4 GW, including 5.4 GW with signed connection agreements.

The initiative supports the expansion of small existing renewable power generation projects and new projects that are no bigger than 1 MW, according to the press release.
The scheme is divided into two funding streams.
The first stream, with a total budget allocation of €3.5 billion, is a 20-year tariff on the quantity of electricity consumed by self-consumers and renewable energy communities financed through a levy on the electricity bill of all consumers. A renewable energy community in this context is defined as, “legal entities empowering citizens, small businesses and local authorities to produce, manage and consume their electricity.”
The second stream, with a total funding allocation of €2.2 billion, is an investment grant paying for under half (40%) of a project’s total costs. Projects would be located in 5,000-person municipalities and be operational before June 30, 2026.
The second arm of the funding was made available through the €723.8 billion Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) – a European Commission instrument aimed at strengthening the European Union (EU) following the Covid-19 pandemic.
The allocation came after the European Commission’s “positive assessment” of Italy’s Recovery and Resilience Plan – approved July 31, 2021 – which called for a €11.2 billion investment in improving and developing the Mediterranean country’s renewable energy technologies, circular economy and water waste and management facilities, among others.
According to recent numbers provided by the Polytechnic University of Milan, Italy has currently 104 energy communities in operation. “Considering the project under development, their number may soon reach 191,” the university said in a report.
In 44% of cases, the promoters of the energy communities are municipalities, while in the other cases, they are mainly private companies. More than 70% of the energy communities analyzed use systems with a total power of less than 200 kW and 100% of them are photovoltaic energy.
Gestore dei Servizi Energetici (GSE), the Italian energy agency, recently published an interactive map of the primary substations in Italy. The tool allows users to geolocalize connection points for energy communities, as required by Italian legislation on self-consumption.
Italy introduced new provisions for solar energy communities in March 2020.

“This system is viable in both residential and commercial sectors, since all use some form of cooling, available waste heat for use, or use of hydraulic power. The Cavgenx heat pump turbine is designed to be used with our saltwater redox flow battery (SRFB) Salgenx,” CEO Gregory Giese told pv magazine, adding that the system could be used in combination with PV power generation. “We are planning a pilot installation to evaluate this integration in a real-world setting.”
The heat pump turbine utilizes PV power or alternative electricity sources for simultaneous cooling and hydraulic power, suitable for running industrial machinery with hydraulic motors, and boasting a coefficient of performance (COP) exceeding three.
The proposed system configuration involves PV or alternative power sources initiating an electric motor that drives a shaft compressor. A cavitating disc pressurizes liquid working fluid to vapor, which is then heated for increased pressure and expanded through a common shaft turbine. The rotation of the shaft turbine powers the forward cavitating compressor, a hydraulic pump, and a feed pump. The vapor is subsequently condensed for cooling purposes.
The turbine uses a common shaft to instantly power the cavitation compressor from fluid to pressurized gas and also drives the hydraulic power take-off. Initiated by an electric motor, the assembly becomes self-powering, resembling a conventional turbine cycle, with the need for heat to sustain the cycle.
“One of the biggest benefits of using this heat pump turbine is simultaneous production of cooling,” Giese said. “We can take heat from AI processor data centers, use that heat to power the turbine, and then return cooling as part of that cycle.”
The turbine, connected by a common shaft, links to the compressor and power take-off accessories. With variable heat from PV panels or solar thermal, the system stores heat in a sand battery or hot water tank, addressing solar power intermittency and offering levelized thermal storage.
Zeolite pellets may also be used as a heat storage medium. “Zeolite pellets have some interesting qualities, including releasing huge amounts of stored heat when water is applied, which make it perfect for this application, ” Giese said. “Solar PV can be used to store heat in the Zeolite pellets, then heat can be released when needed.”
The heat pump turbine can also be combined with battery storage. “Incorporating batteries is a viable solution,” he said. “They can store excess energy generated during peak sunlight and supply power during low sunlight periods, ensuring continuous operation of the heat pump turbine.”
The manufacturer said the heat pump turbines are highly efficient in converting energy, leading to lower energy consumption.
“This efficiency translates to lower operational costs over time, especially in heating and cooling applications,” Giese said. “Grid-based arbitrage can be realized by using off-peak power from the grid to generate cold water via a Calmac system or ice, which can be used during on-peak power when electrical rates are much higher, realizing significant cost savings.”
The company is currently developing and testing the system in Madison, in the US state of Wisconsin. It wants to sell it in any market sector where heat pumps and hydraulic motors are used, which includes industry and large industrial equipment such as construction equipment.
“The system could be used to retrofit existing CO2 heat pump systems which are used for air conditioning, hot water, and process heat. Such systems realize the user 20-80 percent energy and cost savings,” Giese stated.

“At the heart of the infra concept is the next3 rack, which is the smart distribution hub for energy from the sources to the loads, without any required external meter or accessory,” said the Swiss power electronics manufacturer. “The device topology embraces a full backup capability to run off-grid if required with peak power supplying any type of loads.“
The system has two 12 kW inputs for solar panels and features 5 kWh batteries from Italian manufacturer Weco. Users can choose to install between one and six batteries. However, Studer recommends at least three batteries.
“A double transfer switch is built-in with no requirement of external backup setups. Alternative AC sources as generators are also compatible,” the company said. “The grid connection is therefore optional, not mandatory. In case of blackout when grid-tied, and without any additional accessory, the system will automatically switch to off-grid mode and continue powering the loads.”
The system measures 2.2 meters in height and is 60 cm wide, with a length of 1.05 meters. Including six batteries, it weighs 816 kg. Its temperature is controlled with air cooling and meets IP54 or IP55 protection standards.

The first batch of rectangular cells was recently produced at Huasun’s Hefei factory. The new module, called Everest, builds on the success of the company’s Himalaya module series and comes in three sizes: 430-460 W (residential), 490-520 W (commercial & industrial), and 600-640 W (utility scale).
Session 3 | Next generation cell and module tech
Dec 5, 12:15 pm CET, Berlin
What does life-after-PERC look like? High-efficiency n-type technologies have surged into the mainstream with TOPCon clearly the front runner. But HJT and xBC technologies are also being advanced and bringing unique value to the market. In the current oversupply market, how will high-efficiency technologies compete, and what is the pathway for future cost reductions? Furthermore, can these next-generation technologies overcome material supply challenges? More info and free registration.
Traditionally, silicon wafers are cut into squares and then processed into solar cells. Solar module manufacturers increasingly use half-cells in modules because it reduces resistance and power loss, while increasing efficiency and yield. However, cutting processed square solar cells in half presents risks of damage and breakage. By starting out with rectangular silicon wafers and then processing those into HJT cells, Huasun is reducing these risks, as well as eliminating the equipment necessary to cut each individual processed cell in half.
The 210R module, featuring double-glass structure, incorporates an advanced EVA with PIB edge sealant. This combination enhances its waterproof capability and ensures exceptional reliability. It features a 110 μm silicon wafer, which the manufacturer plans to reduce to 90 μm in the future. Huasun says the advanced Everest series modules have a greater resistance to hotspots and high reliability, with an expected ≥88% power retention rate after 30 years. The company says the new module’s temperature coefficient is -0.26%/°C and that it has a bifaciality of over 85%, with a world leading module power of 640 W and efficiency of 23.7% in mass production. The 210R cells could achieve an average efficiency of 25.5% in mass production.

According to Huasun data, compared with a 600 W TOPCon module, the switch to the rectangular 630 W HJT module, as well as the application of silver-plated copper, will reduce balance of system (BOS) costs by 1.7% and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) by 2.6%. The increased yield and lower costs of the rectangular model are projected to increase the internal rate of return (IRR) on a project by 3.9%.
In addition to reducing the cost, Huasun is also lowering the carbon footprint of its HJT modules. In July 2023, the manufacturer achieved 366.12 g/W CO2 equivalent, and it anticipates reaching 300 g/W in the near future. Additionally, the 210R module series comes with a 15-year product warranty and a 30-year performance warranty.
The utility scale size module in Huasun’s Everest series is available in the “golden size” – 2382 mm x 1134 mm – which is rapidly becoming the standard size for modules in the industry and was recently agreed upon by the China Photovoltaic Industry Association and multiple manufacturers. Huasun is manufacturing the Everest modules at its facilities in Hefei, Wuxi, and Xuancheng with an initial annual capacity of 12 GW.
Since its establishment, Huasun has dedicated itself to positioning heterojunction as a mainstream solar cell technology in the n-type era through consistent advances in industrialization and commercialization. With the launch of the Everest module series, Huasun says its goal is to be at the forefront of HJT’s advance into the “R” era.

The startup’s new rooftop system has two 350 W Canadian Solar panels, a Hoymiles HMS600 inverter, which limits system power to 600 W, and two ballast tanks.
Without ballast, the system weighs 55 kg and measures 270 cm x 173 cm x 34 cm. It comes with 5 m of cabling and does not require additional on-site wiring. It can be installed within 20 minutes and is easily moved, according to the company. The mounting rack is made of Magnelis-branded steel and aluminum.
“There are very clear safety guidelines for what to do and what not to do during installation with technical details on correct positioning and filling of ballasts, for example,” said Hoexum, adding that the unit price of €880 ($963.4) means that a small Dutch urban household should be able to recoup its investment within five years without subsidies.
Furthermore, Rable makes a material sustainability claim for its tiny rooftop system. The sub-structure is made of metal salvaged from the production line of its flagship Rable4roofs systems. To prevent overproduction and to produce only what is purchased, the system is sold on a pre-order basis. By selling via the company’s online shop, the company can seize the opportunity to offer a solution without the need for an electrical engineer or solar installer, according to Hoexum.
The residential rooftop system is an addition to the Delft-based company’s commercial and industrial (C&I) products, which have a size ranging from 10 m to 25 m. These ballast-free systems are lightweight and were conceived for roofs that cannot support more than 7 kg of ballast per square meter and made for East-West orientation. “We started installing the first large projects this year,” said Hoexum, adding that at the end of this month, the eighth project will be realized with two more planned for the end of December.
Its largest project to date is a 5,000-panel rooftop plant sold to Reginox, a Dutch kitchen cabinet company, following a pilot plot with 240 panels.
In May, Rable announced raising €2.5 million ($2.72 million) from Dutch investors. The plan is to develop the domestic and Belgian markets as a first step, followed by Sweden, France and Germany later on.

German Financial Corporation, backed by the German Development Bank (KfW), has earmarked an unspecified amount of funds for the project, according to tender documents. Funding could also be sourced from, “KfW, Worldbank, AFD or other financers,” the tender document states.
The project is expected to be implemented within an eight-month time frame and be awarded a power purchase agreement (PPA).
Three years ago, KenGen sought consultancy services for developing floating solar projects at three Kenyan hydropower reservoirs – Kamburu, Turkwel and Kiambere – according to tender documents.
The study recommended developing a 40 MW floating solar project at Kamburu due to “minimal water level variation, less design complication, good infrastructure (road network and grid), lower O&M costs and lower permitting costs due to ownership by KenGen,” the documents state.
KenGen is constructing a 40 MW utility-scale ground-mounted PV array at Seven Forks Cascade, opposite Kamburu.
Deadline for applications is Dec. 15, 2023.
Kenya recorded an estimated 307 MW of solar installed capacity at the end of last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Association.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/27/first-attempt-to-build-back-contact-micrometric-iii-v-photovoltaic-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CANADA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 27, 2023",First attempt to build back-contact micrometric III-V photovoltaic cells,"Researchers at the Université de Sherbrooke in Canada have fabricated miniaturized back contact triple junction III-V solar cells that have a low shading factor and a high wafer area utilization.
“We have developed triple-junction cells with a size twice the thickness of a strand of hair,” the research corresponding author, Matthieu De Lafontaine, told pv magazine. “The cells have significant advantages over conventional solar technologies, reducing electrode-induced shadowing by 95% and potentially lowering energy production costs by up to three times.”
According to De Lafontaine, those properties lend themselves to various applications, from the densification of electronic devices to areas such as solar cells, portable electronic devices, and lightweight nuclear batteries for space exploration, as well as miniaturization of devices for telecommunications and the internet of things.
The scientists built the three-junction cells with three-dimensional (3D) interconnects based on through substrate vias (TSVs), which are commonly utilized to create 3D integrated circuits in micro-electromechanical systems. They consist of vertical electrical connections that pass completely through a silicon wafer.
“For photovoltaics, 3D interconnects can increase the conversion efficiency and reduce the shading,” they explained. “Using TSVs to transfer the front side contact to the back side through the device could mitigate shading, dark current contribution, and resistive losses.”
The group applied this new concept to triple-junction III-V solar cells, which are well known for strong performance and efficiency, but also for shading and resistive losses. “However, the baseline process does not depend on a specific heterostructure, which means that it could be applied to four or more junction solar cells,” they stated.
Moreover, the cost of producing cells made from III-V materials has confined them to niche applications, such as drones and satellites, where low weight and high efficiency are more pressing concerns than cost.
The cell is based on a top cell made of indium, gallium and phosphorus (InGaP), a middle device relying in indium, gallium and arsenide (InGaAs), and a bottom cell made of germanium (Ge). The scientists used wafer bonding to handle 20-μm-thin III-V films. They were able to reduce significantly the metallized area on the front side of the entire solar cell through the 3D interconnections.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 18.3% an open-circuit voltage of 2.276 V, a short-circuit current density of 8.61 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 82.1%.
The novel cell design was also found to achieve a small shading factor below 3% and a 6-fold increase in wafer area use, compared to cells based on 2D interconnects. “Simulation results have shown that TSVs could reduce the series resistance by 70% compared with standard contacts on triple-junction solar cells,” the group said.
The team includes academics from the Canada's University of Ottawa and the Université Grenoble Alpes CNRS in France. They presented the device in the paper “3D interconnects for III-V semiconductor heterostructures for miniaturized power devices,” published in Cell Reports Physical Science.
“The development of these first back-contact micrometric photovoltaic cells is a crucial step in the miniaturization of electronic devices,” they concluded.

Startup Graphite Energy has started building the first stage of a renewable agriculture facility in central New South Wales. The AUD 29 million ($19.0 million) facility is a collaboration between Graphite Energy and Cygnus AG.
Graphite Energy does not appear to have been on the scene for very long, but it says it has developed a proprietary thermal energy storage system for the decarbonization of industrial and manufacturing operations. It is not clear yet how this technology will work within the facility, but presumably it will store solar energy.
Graphite Energy said the facility includes 5 MW of solar to be combined with “multiple forms of integrated energy storage,” as well as batteries, thermal energy storage for heating, cooling and drying, and hydrogen for diesel substitution.
The project aims to be a replicable pilot for Australia and abroad to demonstrate how renewable energy and agriculture can coexist, “using industry advancements to enable renewable energy sources without forgoing farmland,” said Graphite Energy.
