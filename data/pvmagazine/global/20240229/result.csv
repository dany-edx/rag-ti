According to new analysis by Wood Mackenzie, renewable energy costs were 13% cheaper than conventional coal last year and are expected to be 32% cheaper by 2030.
“Utility PV solar has emerged in 2023 as the cheapest power source in the region, while onshore wind is expected to become cheaper than coal after 2025,” said Alex Whitworth, vice president, head of Asia-Pacific power research at Wood Mackenzie. “Renewables firmed with battery storage is becoming competitive with gas power today but will struggle to compete with coal before 2030.”
Big PV emerged as the cheapest power source in 11 out of 15 countries in the Asia Pacific in 2023. According to WoodMac, PV power costs saw “a significant decline of 23% in 2023, marking the end of two years of supply chain disruptions and inflation.”
Looking ahead, Wood Mackenzie predicts that new-build solar project costs will drop by another 20% by 2030, driven by falling module prices and increasing oversupply from China.
Meanwhile, distributed solar costs fell 26% in 2023, with the technology now 12% cheaper on average than residential power prices. Wood Mackenzie said this creates large potential for more rooftop solar applications.
“This trend has made distributed solar increasingly attractive for end-users in many markets in Asia Pacific, with costs already 30% below rising residential tariffs in China and Australia,” said Sooraj Narayan, senior research analyst, APAC power and renewables at Wood Mackenzie. “However, some markets like India with subsidised residential power tariffs will need to wait until 2030 or later to achieve competitive distributed solar prices.”
Overall, China is leading the way in bringing down the cost of renewables, with utility-scale PV, onshore wind, and offshore wind being 40% to 70% cheaper when compared to other Asia-Pacific markets.
Concerns about profitability, grid integration, backup, and energy storage persist among investors, even though declining costs are supporting investment in renewables.
“Government policies will play a crucial role going forward to support upgrading grid reliability, transmission capacity, and promoting battery storage to manage the intermittent nature of renewables,” said Whitworth.
In December, Ernst & Young said in a report that the global weighted average LCOE for PV is now 29% lower than the cheapest fossil fuel alternative.
Earlier this year, Wood Mackenzie predicted strong yet flat global PV growth through to 2032. It estimated that around 350 GW of global solar will be annually installed for the next eight years.

The project, billed as the first of its kind in Europe, features three rooftop arrays and one new ground-mounted PV system, with a total capacity of 690 kWp. They are connected to the power grid via an existing 2 MW wind turbine instead of their own inverters. The project also features a 10 MWh flow battery energy storage system.
Each of the different technologies were integrated through a shared DC bus – commonly referred to as DC-coupled architecture – using Ampt String Optimizers, a type of DC/DC converter that performs maximum power point tracking (MPPT).
Ampt’s optimizers use individual string MPPT to mitigate energy losses caused by shade from surrounding buildings on the Fraunhofer ICT campus. The optimizers are programmable and provide string-level data, which enhances visibility of the system functions, as well as operation and maintenance capabilities.
Andrea Grotzke, global director of energy solutions at BayWa re, said Ampt’s technology “simplified a technically very complex project.”
“The way we have added solar to the existing wind energy and battery storage system is unique, and in successfully completing this project we were able to further improve our own expertise and capabilities,” said Grotzke.
According to Levant Gun, the CEO of Ampt, combining rooftop and ground-mounted solar in seven different orientations and two module sizes in one common microgrid with wind power and batteries was a significant challenge.
“This project is a testament to the capabilities of our industry-leading power conversion technology to simplify control of the diverse systems spread across a site,” Gun said.
Fraunhofer ICT said it will use the system to support its campus of more than 100 laboratories, as well as several pilot plans and three test centers. 
“It was important for us to add solar to the microgrid that powers our campus, to bring additional flexibility and ensure higher utilization of our system,” said Frank Henning, institute director of Fraunhofer ICT. “Sustainability plays a crucial role for Fraunhofer ICT, and by combining the advantages of wind, solar and storage, we are ensured to meet our sustainability goals and operate in a responsible manner.”

2,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/02/29/polysilicon-shipments-into-china-fall-to-lowest-level-since-2011/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,CHINA",PATRICK JOWETT,2024-02-29,Polysilicon shipments into China fall to lowest level since 2011,"Polysilicon imports into China have fallen to their lowest level since 2011, according to analysis from Bernreuter Research.
The research group used Chinese customs statistics to calculate that imports of the feedstock for solar cells and semiconductors fell by 28.5% from 88,093 metric tons (MT) in 2022 to 62,965 MT in 2023. This volume is slightly less than the 64,614 MT reached in 2011.
According to the head of Bernreuter Research, Johannes Bernreuter, the decline comes as leading non-Chinese polysilicon manufacturers Wacker, Hemlock Semiconductor, and OCI Malaysia increasingly shift their shipments from China to Vietnam, which is where three of the four largest Chinese PV module suppliers have set up wafer plants.
The three companies increased their polysilicon exports to Vietnam from 18,672 MT in 2022 to 33,265 MT in 2023, up 78.2% year on year. Bernreuter Research says this increase “more than compensated” for the 13,918 MT they lost in business volume in China in 2023. 
The shift appears influenced by US import legislation. From June 6, the US Department of Commerce will impose duties on manufacturers in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam who use Chinese wafers to produce solar cells and modules, circumventing anti-dumping and countervailing duties.
Previously, the US Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which went into effect in mid-2022, banned products made in Xinjiang, China. This prompted Chinese PV module suppliers to create separate supply chains based on polysilicon from non-Chinese manufacturers for exports to the United States.
Bernreuter Research said that having a wafer production facility outside of China makes it easier for manufacturers to document to the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency that no silicon metal or polysilicon from Xinjiang has entered their supply chains for modules destined for the US market. However, customs statistics show that polysilicon exports from China to Vietnam rose from 639 MT in 2022 to 4,970 MT in 2023 – an increase of more than 700%. Bernreuter Research said this “raises doubts about the claims of a separate supply chain and should sound alarm bells at the CBP.”
US-based Hemlock Semiconductor, Germany's Wacker, and OCI Malaysia together were able to increase their polysilicon exports to Vietnam from 18,672 MT in 2022 by 14,593 MT, up 78.2%, to 33,265 MT in 2023. This growth more than compensated for the 13,918 MT they lost in business volume in China in 2023, said Bernreuter Research.
In the fourth quarter of 2023, the combined share of Wacker and OCI of total Chinese polysilicon imports rose to 97.8%. While total imports lay between roughly 15,000 MT and 20,000 MT per quarter in the first three quarters, the amount fell abruptly to less than 10,000 MT in the fourth quarter.  
Bernreuter Research said that “if the fourth quarter is any indicator for 2024, then polysilicon imports into China will plunge by another 40% to no more than 38,000 MT this year.”
In November, Bernreuter Research said it that it expected polysilicon prices to soon dip below the historical low of $6.75/kg, which was reached in June 2020. It told pv magazine at the time that it expected an all-time low to be reached in the first half of 2024. 
Analysis from OPIS showed that China’s polysilicon prices fell to CNY 60.25 ($8.40)/kg) on Jan. 16, down 51.8% year on year – before rising slightly to CNY 60.67/kg on Feb. 9.

Dubravka Djedovic Handanovic, Serbia’s mining and energy minister, said at the EBRD Western Balkans Investment Summit in London this week that Serbia will auction at least 400 MW of wind and solar power in 2024.
“Three-year auction plan for the period 2023-25, which we adopted last year, will secure at least 1,300 MW of new renewable energy capacity through private investments and by means of auctions and market premiums,” she said. “In our first three-year plan, we focused on large investments, because that is the only way we can progress faster in the energy transition process.”
In its first renewable energy auction, Serbia sought to allocate 50 MW of solar and 400 MW of wind power. The procurement exercise attracted 16 project proposals with a combined capacity of 816 MW.
The government said last August that the lowest bid for wind projects was €0.06448 ($0.070)/kWh and the lowest offer for PV reached €0.08865/kWh. The ceiling prices were €0.0105/kWh and €0.090/kWh, respectively. The selected developers will secure a 15-year contract for difference (Cdf).
Addressing the summit this week, the energy minister noted that investments in renewables are as important as the stability of supply. Last year, Serbia introduced an amendment to the Law on the Use of Renewable Energy Sources, under which suppliers are obliged to balance their production and take financial responsibility towards the transmission system operator for all deviations from planned and contracted obligations.
“We are requiring bank guarantees to conclude connection contracts and in case the network cannot accommodate all projects seeking connection approvals, the investor has various options to secure additional capacity for balancing, such as battery energy storage systems,” said Djedovic Handanovic.
She said that Serbia is the first country in the region that has introduced the intraday electricity market and established a regional spot market together with Slovenia, which is soon to be joined by Hungary.
“Serbian is the first country in the Western Balkan region which has welcomed two fully merchant renewable energy projects,” she said. “This shows that new regulations have given predictability and security to investors.”
In January, the Serbian government secured an investment commitment from Chinese companies Shanghai Fengling Renewables and Serbia Zijin Copper to the tune of €2 billion, in what the Mining and Energy Ministry described as the biggest investment in renewable energy in the country to date. It envisages the construction of 1.5 GW wind and 500 MW of solar projects alongside a green hydrogen production facility with 30,000 tons of annual output.
According to the Association of Renewable Energy Sources of Serbia, the country has installed around 60 MW of solar. However, that figure is not exact, as there is no official registry for solar installed for self-consumption at this stage. Last April, Serbia switched on its largest utility-scale solar project, the 9.9 MW Delasol PV project in the Lapovo, central Serbia.

Europe must maintain its momentum in deploying new renewable energy generation assets, necessitating imports, while also prioritizing energy resilience by committing to the development of domestic value chains. Two sides of the same coin, Europe is facing increasing pressure to achieve net zero commitments amid a difficult market environment and an unstable geopolitical landscape.
Asia dominates the market when it comes to solar panels. By contrast, the manufacture of inverters – the “smart” part of a solar project – is quite evenly divided between Asia, the United States, and Europe.
Tensions are running high with lobby group the European Solar Manufacturing Council emphasizing that the European Union is inundated with an excess of PV panels – some analysts estimate as much as 70 GW to 85 GW of unsold stock – and with European solar manufacturers struggling to break even.
It is essential to develop a more local supply chain but we have to be realistic about that aim. European Union imports from China exceed 80% of products in certain early segments of the solar supply chain, including rare earth and polysilicon production, according to the International Energy Agency. We need to be pragmatic about the changes needed to reduce our dependency on imports and that includes having a long-term vision for the market alongside actionable short-term plans.
At Otovo, we have positioned ourselves in favour of a global trade system without trade barriers. On Feb. 6, 2024, Otovo entered a strategic partnership with manufacturer Meyer Burger to promote and sell European solar modules together. At the same time, we signed a petition calling for a “resilience” bonus in the Solarpaket 1 legislation being discussed by the German government. The proposed bonus would be an additional payment for solar projects developed under tender and which use European components. Thus, we have aligned ourselves with both upstream producers and a broad spectrum of manufacturers despite many downstream solar players expressing reservations about the policy.
The fact certain companies owned by Asian entities are producing inexpensive panels is, broadly speaking, positive. International trade relies on everyone specializing in what they do comparatively well and exchanging their goods for mutual benefit. In 2022, Europe added more than 40 GW of solar generation capacity, as reported by pv magazine, but despite our best efforts, no part of the value chain in Europe could supply as much as 5 GW, meaning a reliance on imports to the ratio of seven-to-one. If Europe wants to maintain the pace of solar deployment needed to reach net zero commitments, global cooperation is pivotal.
Such cooperation and European energy resilience are not mutually exclusive. Recent wars and crises have disrupted Europe's solar energy industry and caused severe shortages in clean energy infrastructure and generation capacity. Market instability has created wild fluctuations in panel, inverter, and battery prices which quickly reversed cost gains made in previous years. In such a context, having incentives to strengthen local value chains can obviously be smart for building alternatives over time. It is a critical time. Those value chains must include raw materials, refining, and manufacturing. The aim is to maintain European knowhow, ensure shorter supply routes, and reduce reliance on a handful of providers.
The difficulty lies in developing a European solar supply chain without damaging the roll-out of PV in the short-term. This balancing act requires global collaboration as much as domestic policy support, to create resilience. We must create a system with two lanes, one supporting free global competition to favor rapid deployment and another to create a resilience bonus that would benefit consumers who buy European-made solar and battery equipment. That is why Otovo supports the inclusion of a resilience bonus in the proposed German legislation.
It is time for European companies and manufacturers to both embrace collaboration with manufacturers outside the European Union and to adopt strategic domestic partnership efforts. To accelerate the energy transition in Europe, companies and policymakers alike must increasingly adopt a “Made in Europe” solar energy mindset. This is a crucial step in strengthening resilience within the European solar industry while not excluding trade partners.
In the meantime, the priority for the downstream solar industry should be to increase efficiency and reduce costs. In Otovo’s latest market data, from January 2024, Germany’s total cost per system sits 16% higher than in the Netherlands, and 54% above Polish prices. A United Kingdom system costs twice that of a Polish one, and 60% more than one installed in Sweden. That represents a lot of consumer surplus that German and British households are missing out on. Furthermore, labor costs for solar installations in Germany and the United Kingdom still exceed those in the Netherlands, Poland, France, and Austria – with only Switzerland ranking higher in Europe. There is definitely room for improvement.
To protect its plans to establish a European solar supply chain while maintaining solar momentum in the short term, the European Union must adopt a strategy that balances immediate needs with future objectives. Competition is healthy and, by reducing Europe’s current level of import dependency, we could really embrace the challenge of competition as an opportunity, rather than a threat. We should not shy away from the reality of import dependency but we must also accept that, in the short-term, we still need to import supplies at the same time as we build out domestic production capacity.
The European Union must strive to streamline regulatory processes, collaborate with industry stakeholders, ensure the development of a skilled renewables workforce and, most importantly, must incentivize domestic production. Introducing trade barriers would only hinder the progress currently being made across Europe and reduce our chances of meeting net zero commitments.

5,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/02/29/u-s-startup-offers-solar-kit-for-vipv-applications/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,INVERTERS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CANADA,UNITED STATES",VALERIE THOMPSON,2024-02-29,U.S. startup offers solar kit for VIPV applications,"U.S.-based energy technology and heat pump specialist Worksport has announced a solar PV truck bed cover initially customized for the Ford F-150 Lightning, an electric pickup truck.
Conceived for vehicle-integrated photovoltaics (VIPV), the solar tonneau cover, dubbed Solis, will be sold in a kit with a Worksport inverter, dubbed Hub, and a 2000 W, 120 V AC 60 Hz rechargeable battery, dubbed Cor.
It is conceived as an off-grid energy solution for consumers. “We will begin sales with the North American market and will eventually expand to global markets,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The Solis truck bed covers can be between 2.7 m2 and 4.3 m2 in size. The modules contain M10 cells with 22% efficiency provided by an undisclosed supplier. “We will use flexible mono-crystalline cells that provide 170 W/m2, after conversion. The weight will be between 10 kg and 11 kg per m2,” they added. The performance figures are considered under 1000 W/m² solar irradiance.
The U.S.-based technology company, with manufacturing in New York State and China, will be marketing the product in a kit that would include truckbed mounting brackets and cables.
The battery is a 2000 W, unit with 1534 kWh, 120 V AC, 60 Hz capacity. It has a lithium nickel, cobalt and manganese (Li-NCM) battery cell. The rated voltage is 48 V and the minimum voltage is 40.3 V. The battery's maximum discharge current is 60 A, and the maximum charge current is 20 A. The discharge temperature is -20 C to 65 C while the battery charging temperature range is 0 C to 55 C.
The inverter unit has an output frequency of 60 Hz, and maximum output power of 3 kW. It has a 200 Wh hot swap capacity, overload protection, 4 DC outlets, plus ports for USB and cigarette lighter connector charging.
Solis is not yet available for purchase. Worksport said in a statement that products are in the testing phase. The final prices are not confirmed. Estimated price for the battery is $1,499, including the inverter, one external battery, and charging cables. Bundled with Solis, the price is estimated to be $3,499.
Some of the scenarios seen by Worksport besides camping, include charging devices, such as cellphones, tablets, or other electronics, during power outages in the home or office. It is not meant for charging electric vehicle (EV) charging systems. The company said it may develop such technology in the future as its internal estimates suggested that the PV cover could provide enough charging to provide a potential additional range of up to 10 miles a day.
The solar cover will also be available on standard internal combustion engine trucks, according to the company.

Two unique power plants with high-capacity factors, one using wind and the other using solar, are set to come online in the United States. The facilities are designed to maximize the value of their interconnection (IX) connections by transmitting as much electricity as possible to the grid.
Nearly two years ago, a Portuguese project by Energias de Portugal (EDP) highlighted the enduring value of owning an interconnection (IX) location. In a grid-connection auction, EDPR won the project by agreeing to pay the electrical system €4 for each megawatt-hour generated by their floating solar plant over 15 years.
Eland Solar’s development team, Arevon Energy, recently announced that it closed on $1.2 billion of financing for the construction of Eland 2, the second phase of the project, located in California. This phase includes a 200 MW (AC)/374 MW (DC) solar power facility paired with a 150 MW/600 MWh energy storage system.
Initially, when the project hit the news, its former owner, 8Minutenergy, stated that the facilities would have a 60% AC capacity factor. This claim was noteworthy because the sun is only above the horizon for 50% of the time annually.

7,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/02/29/new-method-to-repair-ribbon-busbar-interruptions-in-pv-panels/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-02-29,New method to repair ribbon busbar interruptions in PV panels,"A group of researchers led by Spain's Centre for Energy, Environmental and Technological Research (CIEMAT) has developed a set of techniques to repair ribbon busbar interruptions in photovoltaic panels.
“Interruptions between cells account for 10% of module failures,” the research's lead author, Félix García Rosillo, told pv magazine. “Repairing interruptions can be performed using conventional hand tools and may help recover most of a module's nominal power.”
The scientists presented two different repair methods. The first requires the complete removal of the module backsheet, the replacement of the damaged busbars, and the placement of a new backsheet. The second requires the removal of the backsheet in the damaged area, the soldering the busbar and sealing via silicone resin.
Both techniques do not require the acquistion of expensive electroluminescence (EL) images of the panels before and after repair. “It is important to clarify that it is not possible to obtain EL images from a module affected by twin ribbon busbar interruptions,” the scientists noted. “If current tries to flow between solar panel contacts, connected to a power supply and two of the cells are affected by a total ribbon busbar interruption, the current will not flow and consequently, it will not be possible to obtain the EL image.”
The academics explained that by removing the diodes from the junction box and checking the electrical connections between the different terminals in the junction box at the time of the EL measurement, images of non-affected series of cells can be obtained. They also warned that, in pre-repair EL images, only the active series of cells are visible to the camera. “When the module is repaired, the EL image reveals all cells and it is possible to know their actual state,” they added.
The repair process requires the use tone testers or cable locators to allow the precise identification of the twin interrupted cell interconnection. “A tone tester that can perform this task can cost as low as few more than two tens of euros,” the team said. “A similar result can be achieved by using a current detector to locate single bus bar cell interruptions, also at low cost and with a fast procedure.”
The final repair step can be executed through conventional handicraft tools like mini rotary drill tools such as grit sanding bands or conventional soldering tools. “A soldering paste and ribbon bus bar complements prove to be a good option for repairing the ribbon bus bar interruptions,” the researchers stressed.
After repair, the proposed method requires the implementation of an IV curve measurement to ascertain how much power output has been recovered.
The research group conducted a series of tests on three 215 W modules produced in 2006 by German manufacturer Qcells and found that, in some cases, it is possible to multiply the power production of the damaged modules by four times.
“Safety must be an important objective when repairing PV module, and any repaired module that does not pass some basic safety tests, must be decommissioned and recycled,” they said, referring to the initial selection that should be made to avoid risks for installers.
The new technique was introduced in the paper “Repairing ribbon bus bar interruptions in photovoltaic modules using non-intrusive interruption location,” published in Renewable Energy. “This methodology can be applied in modestly equipped factories or laboratories, lowering the economic cost of repairing PV modules,” the academics concluded.

The proposed process utilizes aluminum (Al) doped and induced polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) formed at low temperatures.
“This approach avoids the high-temperature processes required for poly-Si formation and the toxic gases involved in in-situ doping through chemical vapor deposition,” they emphasized. “In systems where high-temperature contact fabrication could compromise top cell materials – such as in III-V/Si multijunction solar cells formed through epitaxial growth – this technique offers a valuable alternative.”
The researchers built the contacts by using p-Si wafers and p-Si substrates, on which they deposited a 45 nm hydrogenated intrinsic amorphous silicon [a-Si:H(i)] layer. They then deposited 400 nm of Al contacts and annealed the samples at 190 C for 5 minutes.
“The surface passivation is damaged due to the presence of Al dopants. Consequently, instead of using a full-area a-Si:H(i)/Al contact, a localized contact structure was chosen to combine the advantages of superior surface passivation of a-Si:H(i) and low contact resistivity introduced by Al-doped poly-Si,” the researchers explained.
Before annealing, the samples exhibited an “insulator-like” behavior. However, once annealed, the sample showed a contact resistivity of 13.17 mΩ⋅cm2. When tested for passivation quality, the area directly beneath Al contacts was significantly degraded post-annealing.

“It should be noted that, however, the a-Si:H(i) layer still provides passivation for areas not covered by Al contacts, despite the reduced passivation quality,” the academics highlighted. “After annealing, the calculated implied open-circuit voltage drop is about 12.7 mV for regions without Al. The preserved passivation and reasonable voltage drop indicate the feasibility of applying this contact technique as localized passivated contacts.”
Following those results, the researchers moved forward to create proof-of-concept solar cells. They were fabricated based on PERC cell precursors of p-Si with a conventional n-type emitter. The front surface was passivated with silicon nitride (SiNx), which also performed as an anti-reflection coating (ARC). Additionally, a 400 nm Al layer was deposited on top to form a full-area Al contact.
For the construction of the rear, the back structure of the PERC cell precursor was removed. A 45 nm a-Si:H(i) layer was then deposited, followed by localized circular Al contacts. The process was then followed by annealing at 190 C for 5 minutes.
“A reference cell based on the PERC precursor featuring a full-area Al back contact was also fabricated for comparison,” the scientists said. “Power conversion efficiencies of 17% and 13.9% were obtained for cells with the a-Si:H(i)/Al contact and a full area Al back contact, respectively, indicating a 3% absolute efficiency enhancement.”
Their findings were presented in the study “Low-temperature aluminum doped and induced polysilicon and its application as partial rear contacts on p-type silicon solar cells,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells. The group was formed by researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Sydney and the University of Oxford.

Now a team led by researchers from Chinese vertically integrated module manufacturer Longi has developed processes to fabricate high-efficiency heterojunction (HJT) solar cells, while reportedly avoiding the fragility and lower efficiency results seen in earlier attempts to produce thinner cells.
In the study “Flexible silicon solar cells with high power-to-weight ratios,” published in nature, the scientists said the new cell ranges in thickness from 57 μm to 125 μm and is made using M6 wafers with an area of 274.4 cm2.
The wafer thinning not only lowers the weight and cost, but also facilitates the charge migration and separation, noted the research team.
“The flexible and thin profile of these solar cells open up new opportunities for incorporating solar energy generation into various aspects of daily life and industry in portable electronics, building integrated PV, transportation, space applications, emerging technologies with unconventional surfaces or structure,” Xixiang Xu, Longi R&D team leader and corresponding author, told pv magazine.
The team developed its own control and regulation system to enable a continuous low-damage-plasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process to prevent epitaxy and maintain surface uniformity. It is a modification of the conventional step-by-step, non-continuous CVD process for passivation, noted the researchers.
In addition, they implemented a “self-restoring nanocrystalline sowing and vertical growth process for the doped contacts” in a high-frequency plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) process, which enabled growing “high-quality n-type and p-type carrier selective contacts” for the hole transport layer and electron transport layers.
Another innovation was to use contact-free laser transfer printing to deposit low-shading grid lines. For the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layers, they opted for cerium-doped indium oxide (ICO) and a low-damage reactive plasma deposition (RPD) process.
The team deposited ICO as the TCO coating using a low-damage reactive plasma deposition method, which they said “produced superior electrical performance, including much lower resistivity (2.7 × 10−4 Ω cm) and higher carrier mobility (83.1 cm V−1 s −1), when compared to those of the magnetron sputtering-derived indium tin oxide reported elsewhere”, adding that the process “played a decisive role in subsequent stability improvement.”
The cell achieved a certified power conversion efficiency of 26.06% with a thickness of 57 μm, a value of 26.56% with a thickness of 106 μm, and a maximum efficiency of 26.81% with a thickness of 125 μm. The 57 μm solar cell had  also the highest power-to-weight ratio (1.9 W g−1) and open-circuit voltage (761 mV).
The results were validated by Germany’s Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin.
The scientists were also able to reduce optical loss by optimizing the configuration of grid lines using “industry-compatible contact-free” laser transfer printing technology. “The finger width could be reduced from 40 μm (typical screen printing) to 18 μm, with the shading area controlled to less than 2%,” they noted.
The devices were tested for potential-induced degradation and light-induced degradation, according to the paper. “This technological progress provides a practical basis for the commercialization of flexible, lightweight, low-cost and highly efficient solar cells, and the ability to bend or roll up crystalline silicon solar cells for travel is anticipated,” concluded the team.

SECI has started accepting proposals to set up 1.2 GW of ISTS-connected wind-solar hybrid power projects anywhere in India. The projects are to be developed on a build-own-operate basis.
SECI will enter into a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the successful bidders. SECI will sell the power to the different buying entities of India.
Developers need to submit single bids offering 50 MW minimum contracted capacity, and a maximum of 600 MW. The contracted capacity must be quoted in integral values. The total contracted capacity to be allocated to a single bidder will be limited to 600 MW.
“Bidders who have already commissioned hybrid projects or are in the process of constructing such projects and have untied capacity may also participate under this RfS,” said the tender document. “In such case, they will be given the benefit of a longer period of PPA, commensurate to the duration between the actual date of commencement of supply of power and the scheduled commencement of supply date.”

12,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/02/29/new-approach-to-improve-mppt-in-partially-shaded-pv-systems-operating-at-high-temperatures/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,JORDAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-02-29,New approach to improve MPPT in partially shaded PV systems operating at high temperatures,"Researchers from the Al-Ahliyya Amman University in Jordan and the Addis Ababa Science and Technology University in Ethiopia have developed a new methodology to track global maximum power point (GMPP) in partially shaded PV systems.
The GMPP defines the ability of an inverter to sweep the IV curve of a PV system and identify the array voltage at which the global maximum power point occurs. When a PV system is under partially shaded conditions, its output power-voltage characteristic curve generates multiple local peaks. Under these conditions, the conventional Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) methods could fail to maximize the output power as they track the local maximum power point (MPP) instead of the global MPP (GMPP).
“Our model yields benefits by simulating 33% less power loss, showcasing a capitalization that is less than three times compared to alternative stability methods,” the scientists said.
The proposed methodology is based on the genetic algorithm (GA), which is able to solve constrained and unconstrained optimization problems based on a natural selection process that mimics biological evolution, and the backstepping controller (BSC), which is a recursive technique that is commonly utilized to extract the maximum power from the PV system. It works by breaking down the nonlinear control problem into a series of simpler subsystems.
The BSC algorithm adjusts the pulse width modulation (PWM) signal, which governs the system’s operation through the converter connected to the load, while the GA algorithm computes the BSC gains to achieve an optimal PV system outcome. “The main objective is to ascertain the ideal voltage of the photovoltaic (PV) module, which is constrained within the range of 0 V and the open-circuit voltage,” the researchers explained.
The group tested the novel approach in a simulated PV system located in Maroua, Cameroon. It consisted of three 55 W panels interconnected in series, a DC–DC converter, and a resistive load with a value of 150 Ω. “There is a noticeable and significant rise in temperature in the specified area, characterized by arid conditions and high temperatures similar to those found in a semi-desert climate,” the academics explained.
They said the proposed technique was able to achieve the PV system stabilization in just 0.06 seconds while showing “exceptional” resilience. They also noted, however, that the new methodology has to be validated by future experiments. “Our method accurately detected and mitigated partial shading effects, aiming for the global maximum power point to minimize energy loss,” they concluded.
Their findings were introduced in the paper “Enhancing MPPT performance for partially shaded photovoltaic arrays through backstepping control with Genetic Algorithm-optimized gains,” published in Scientific Reports.

13,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/02/29/us-solar-up-52-in-2023-as-nation-deploys-35-3-gw-of-capacity/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,2024-02-29,US solar up 52% in 2023 as nation deploys 35.3 GW of capacity,"From pv magazine USA
The United States deployed 35.3 GW of new solar capacity in 2023, an increase of 52% versus the 23 GW deployed in 2022. Despite lower electricity demand, significant declines in both wind and hydro generation resulted in minimal growth in total clean electricity.
The figures were released by BloombergNEF, along with the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, in their Sustainable Energy in America 2024 Factbook.

For the year, the United States set a record in utility-scale solar, deploying 23.7GW of capacity, some of which were projects delayed from the previous year due to supply chain issues. Small scale solar totaled nearly 11.6GW of capacity, a record as well. The total capacity deployed, 35.3 GW, was 52% greater than the new capacity of just under 24 GW in 2022.
The US Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) and Wood Mackenzie Renewables & Power project at least 50 GW of solar being deployed in 2024.
Along with solar, 7 GW of wind were deployed, in addition to 7.5 GW of battery storage. The battery capacity deployment increased by 62% over the prior year, bringing the nation’s total deployed capacity to 19.6 GW. In 2024, the EIA sees 15.3 GW of new battery capacity being deployed, which would be a 78% expansion of the nation’s battery fleet.
In total, electricity demand fell 2.2% from 2022, even while the nation’s GDP expanded by 2.4%. The report notes that, with these two pieces of data taken together, US energy productivity (the ratio of US gross domestic product to total US energy consumption) increased by 3.8% year on year. In fact, since 1990, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for electricity has been slowly decreasing, hitting 1.0% in 2023, while the nation’s GDP has grown over 400% during that period.

The addition of significant new wind and solar capacity, combined with steady electricity demand, has contributed to a reduction in emissions from both the sector and the nation as a whole.
Collectively, low-emissions electricity sources, excluding nuclear, saw a marginal increase from 962 TWh to 972 TWh of generation. The flat growth was a balance of hydroelectricity falling by just over 6%, while wind fell by almost 2%. Overall, accounting for the 1% growth and a 2% decrease in electricity demand, renewables met 23% of all generation, setting a new record. Adding in nuclear power, 41.1% of all electricity generated was from zero-carbon sources, another all-time high.

One reason for the large volume of deployment growth in 2023 was a rebound from the slowdown in 2022 due to the pandemic and supply chain constraints. The biggest price increase was in solar modules, with pricing heavily influenced by a significant increase in polysilicon costs. However, since then, polysilicon prices have dropped sharply, with module prices remaining near record lows for the past several months.

“A sputtered cadmium selenide (CdSe) layer was employed to incorporate Se into a CdTe absorber that was deposited by close-space sublimation, and copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) was used as a hole transport layer between the CdTe and the back metal electrode,” the research's corresponding author, Manoj Kumar Jamarkattel, told pv magazine. “This device configuration offers great promise for building integrated photovoltaics, space applications, and higher-rate manufacturing.”
The scientists built the cell with a superstrate based on Corning Willow Glass, which is a flexible, ultra-thin glass manufactured by multinational technology company Corning with its own proprietary fusion draw process. They produced the CTO transparent conductor by sputtering in conjunction with a proximity anneal with CdS. The front buffer layer was comprised of an IGO alloy, prepared by co-sputtering.
Furthermore, they prepared the cell absorber by first depositing CdSe by sputtering followed by CdTe deposited by close-space sublimation. CuSCN was used as a Cu doping source and a hole-transporting back-buffer layer. The cell also relies and a gold (Au) metal contact and an anti-reflecting (AR) coating.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 17.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 861 mV, a short-circuit density of 27.8 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 71.7%. Under air mass zero (AM0) illumination for space applications, these values dropped to 14.6%, 861 mV, 32.3 mA/cm2, and 71.2% respectively.
“We used IGO and CuSCN as front emitter and back contact buffer, respectively,” the scientists explained. “This helped to further improve the open-circuit voltage. IGO has favorable band alignment with the absorber, which minimizes carrier recombination at the front, and CuSCN helps to minimize recombination at the back interface.”
The research group added the cell achieved the highest reported device efficiency for flexible CdTe solar cells to date.
The device was presented in the paper “17.2% Efficient CdSexTe1−x solar cell with (InxGa1−x)2O3 emitter on lightweight and flexible glass,” published in Applied Physics Letters.
The University of Toledo developed several types of CdTe solar cells over the past years. The devices include, among others, a 20%-efficient cell based on a commercial tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer and a 17.4%-efficient device using a layer of copper-aluminum oxide to the rear side of the CdTe thin film.
