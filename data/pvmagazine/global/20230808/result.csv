They identified global concern for iridium demand, particularly if proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) catalysts are heavily used. In addition, limitations in renewable energy sources and water availability could emerge regionally. The study suggests that addressing these challenges, such as developing PGM-free catalysts for PEMWE, could contribute to resolving resource conflicts in the pursuit of global H2-powered aviation. They described their findings in “Resource requirements for the implementation of a global H2-powered aviation,” which was recently published in Energy Conversion and Management.
 Topsoe has signed an agreement with World Energy GH2 to provide its ammonia loop technology for Project Nujio'qonik, Canada's largest renewable hydrogen facility. The project in Newfoundland and Labrador will target 250,000 metric tons of renewable hydrogen production per year. 
H-TEC Systems has sold a 1 MW proton exchange membrane (PEM) ME450 electrolyzer to the University of Stuttgart, in order to start a test center funded by the German government. “One particular focus will be placed on bivalent systems that can be operated with renewably-generated electricity if electricity prices are low in the future or with hydrogen in the event of a power shortage”, said H-TEC Systems. 
Enapter has signed a €6 million (§6.6 million) deal with China's Wolong to make modular hydrogen solutiona in China. The contract includes the delivery of 5 MW multi-core systems for various customers in China, as well as around 130 compact single-core electrolyzers (AEM Electrolyser EL 4.0). Enapter said it wants to gain significant market share in China within the next few years.
Verdagy, a US company focused on advanced electrolysis technology for industrial applications, is set to receive a $5 million investment from Galp. It aims to reduce costs and reliance on critical raw materials in comparison to existing electrolysis methods. Galp's funding is part of a larger financing round that secured $73 million for Verdagy, led by strategic investors Temasek and Shell Ventures. The investment will propel the development and commercialization of Verdagy's 20 MW electrolyzer module, a key component for systems of 200 MW and higher.

French Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne has presented a new plan to the National Council for Ecological Transition (CNTE), outlining revised renewable energy and solar deployment targets for 2030. The plan includes an increase in the energy transition budget from €30 billion ($32.8 billion) to €37 billion.
The updated targets specified in the plan aim for France to reach 48.1 GW of PV capacity by 2030 and 140 GW by 2050. To meet the 2030 goal, the plan calls for the annual deployment of 3,700 MW to 5,500 MW of new PV systems. By the end of March, France had reached 17.15 GW of cumulative installed PV capacity.
However, the proportion of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption remained stagnant at 20.7% in 2022. This makes France the sole European country that has yet to reach its targeted 23% share.
Regarding the long-term vision, the French government's strategy entails deploying a total of 140 GW of solar capacity by the middle of the century. This goal encompasses diverse sources, with 45 GW intended to be generated from installations on wasteland, another 45 GW from facilities situated in natural, agricultural, or forested areas, 35 GW from expansive roofs, and 12 GW from residential self-consumption initiatives.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/08/a-simple-way-to-bring-solar-to-multi-family-apartments/,"MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA,FLORIDA,GEORGIA,ILLINOIS,MISSISSIPPI,TEXAS,UNITED STATES,WISCONSIN",,"AUGUST 8, 2023",A simple way to bring solar to multi-family apartments,"As an apartment dweller who wants to embrace solar energy, the gap in renewable energy access is ever-present. 
The cost of living, including electricity prices, is at its highest in decades. Self-generated solar energy has long been one of the easiest solutions for house owners to reduce their energy bills, access renewable energy, and increase resilience to blackouts. The proportion of households who have installed a solar system in the US has doubled since 2016, to 8%, according to a poll conducted by social-issue thinktank Pew Research Center in January last year.
But what do you do if you live in an apartment, like me? Even if you can get permission to install a solar system on an allocated area of your building’s roofspace, the cost is likely prohibitive. And if you are mainly out of the house during daylight hours, you would be lucky to offset more than 30% of your energy bills, according to Indian-owned solar manufacturer Renewable Energy Corporation. That makes the payback period much longer.
US body the National Association of Home Builders estimates 31.4% of Americans are in the same position as me and this represents a huge opportunity; local solar installers can broaden market outreach through multi-family projects, with portfolio rollouts offering replicable and scalable deal flow across states. What's more, addressing solar access for apartments will ensure that those most impacted by increasing energy costs are included in the clean energy transition; apartment residents earn, on average, 33% less than the median US household, according to the National Multifamily Housing Council.
There is an even bigger hurdle for apartment residents who are renting, as I do: landlords have little incentive to install solar on rented apartments since they typically bear the cost with the benefits passed on to tenants in the form of bill savings. That is why the adoption of residential solar has historically depended on home ownership.
Residential industry projections anticipate fourfold growth in home solar in the next decade and analyst Wood Mackenzie reports we have already seen a record-breaking 40% increase in solar adoption since 2021. The industry must address demand from the 43.9 million US residences in multifamily buildings, however, to maximize solar adoption.
Imagine solar energy from a single rooftop system could be shared between multiple apartments. The solar array collects energy and pipes it down the building to an inverter, which feeds into grid meters. These meters feed into each apartment and common area. Owners could then jointly invest in the system and multi-family landlords could provide solar energy to their tenants. 
Technology born in Australia and imported to the United States last year does just this. Allume Energy’s “SOLShare” product physically splits the energy from a single solar system, via a hardware device, and shares it between multiple meters. If the electricity is fed evenly into all meters at all times, as described above, significant amounts of energy will be fed back into the grid when apartments are not using electricity.
That’s where SOLShare’s “dynamic sharing algorithm” steps in. It feeds electricity to apartments that are using energy, thereby maximizing the energy consumed by the system and reducing the amount of energy fed back to the grid, making it an optimal system in states where there is no net metering. As a result, apartments can expect a 55% to 75% reduction in grid electricity consumption – more if they have a residential battery.
Over a month, SOLShare works out when and where to feed energy, in order to optimize energy consumption and ensure each apartment gets a fair share. Typically, the electricity will be evenly split but it can also be configured to provide more energy to common areas or larger apartments. Not all apartments need to participate and dwellings can be disconnected remotely at any stage.
Allume Energy already provides around 2,000 apartments with clean, affordable energy, with around half of those in social or affordable housing. Having launched recently in the US, Allume is currently operating in Florida and Mississippi and is pursuing projects in California, Georgia, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Texas. The company aims to have SOLShare available nationwide within the next 12 months.
Allume Energy works with multi-family apartment-owning landlords directly and via its growing network of certified SOLShare solar installers.
Owner-occupiers can engage directly with a certified SOLShare installer, who will arrange a site visit and provide a quote for the building as they would for a solar system on a house. The system can then be installed within two months to four months, with little disruption to residents and no change to their current utility setup – except lower bills. Apartment residents can also inquire through the Allume website, enabling the company to connect them with an installer partner. 
Multi-family apartment block landlords can purchase a solar system, priced per unit, directly from Allume. The company works with installer partners to deliver a turnkey solution and landlords can allocate more energy to common areas or larger apartments to suit their needs. There is a small, ongoing connection fee per unit for monitoring a building’s solar usage. 
Landlords can use solar as a revenue stream by pocketing some or all of the savings from the solar system. Alternatively, they can pass the savings on to tenants, improving rentability and occupancy rates. Inquiring about solar access with an asset management firm would be one place to start. 
Available incentives include a 30% investment tax credit, a low-to-moderate income adder worth up to a further 20% tax credit, and a further 10% energy communities adder. Allume also works with clean finance providers to offer affordable options with no upfront costs. The Allume team can guide customers through incentive and finance options in their area and tailored to their circumstances.
By expanding solar access, we can improve the quality of life for vulnerable parts of the community, promote environmental sustainability, and create economic opportunity. Low to moderate income solar energy access for apartment owners and renters is crucial to achieving energy equity and addressing the burden of rising utility bills.
Many apartment owners and renters across the US can now access solar energy directly from their rooftops and those who can’t will be able to in the next year, as more utilities come on board. Government incentives, combined with green finance options, are helping improve affordability so that the people who would most benefit from energy bill savings can access it.
Nevertheless, policymakers, utilities, and community organizations must continue to collaborate to implement supportive policy and programs.

It is already winning contracts with the solution, such as the $8.5 million agreement with ReNew, a NASDAQ-listed renewable energy developer in India, its fifth agreement with ReNew.
Like earlier solutions, the new Airtouch model is a robotic solution, operating autonomously. It is typically installed in arid and dusty locations. It uses airflow and microfiber wipers to remove soil from the PV module surfaces rather than water.
The latest version is designed to provide greater cleaning efficiency and better maneuverability, according to Airtouch Solar. It is a 4-meter cleaning unit that weighs less than 40 kg. For comparison’s sake, the Airtouch AT 3.0 is a six-meter robot.
“Each unit can clean up to 2000 meters on a full charge,” a spokesperson from Airtouch Solar told pv magazine. “Optional rubber flippers can be added for hard-to-remove soiling. Each robot is recharged with the help of solar panels that Airtouch supplies and installs.”
The cleaning units are equipped with sensors and wirelessly connected to Airtouch’s cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) platform for remote monitoring, remote controlling, and management.
With extensive operations in India, Airtouch has been winning long-term supply and maintenance agreements with companies like Renew Energy, Amplus, Adani Green Energy, and Acme, as reported by pv magazine India.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/08/breaking-through-status-quo-bias-with-co-designed-solar-power-plants/,"COMMUNITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE,NETHERLANDS,WORLD",BERNADETTE GEYER,"AUGUST 8, 2023",Breaking through ‘status quo bias’ with co-designed solar power plants,"A study by a group of researchers from the Netherlands has found that participation and input from local stakeholders in the development of solar power plants may have a noticeable positive influence on the local acceptance of the facilities.
The team assessed how “status quo bias” – when people resist any change to their environments – is potentially the main barrier to the transition to clean energies and how PV plant projects can overcome that bias, which is typically not based on scientific or technical grounds.
“The current approach to developing renewable energy projects often faces local opposition and has been said to increase injustice,” the researchers stressed. “One way of addressing procedural justice is to include local stakeholders in the design process. However, it can be difficult for lay audiences to understand the technical complexities of solar power plants.”
To counter the resistance of local citizens with a “Not in My Back Yard” (NIMBY) attitude, the study built on the results of a research project called “In My Backyard Please.” For the new study, the selection of a use case project considered seven factors: a Dutch location, relevance, design opportunities, landscape user experience, possible local resistance, stage of development, and willingness of local stakeholders to cooperate.
In consultation with project partners, the researchers selected a use case in Nauerna, in the northern part of the Netherlands, which they claim “showed potential due to the presence of an invested community that, on one side, wanted to work on a solar power plant, but on the other, showed some signs of resistance to landscape transformation.”
They conducted interviews to gauge the “level of place attachment” of local stakeholders and then carried out a landscape analysis to map the area’s energy potential. Two co-design sessions were organized in March 2020, and participants were invited to share their own ideas for how the solar installation would be designed.
Project partners then used these ideas to develop three design concepts and to create a full-scale prototype that showed different construction options on the site of a landfill. The researchers then conducted interviews with 21 inhabitants from the 92 resident households to assess not only feedback on the prototype but also potential change in community attitudes and support for solar plant development, along with “the value of using a full-scale prototype to visualize design ideas in the context of a participatory design process.”
“The majority of participants (85.7%) reported that the full-scale prototype provided them with more insight into the impact and design possibilities of a solar power plant at the selected location,” the study notes, noting that 81% of the participants said “the prototype positively influenced their opinions,” with the same percentage responding positively to a question about the construction of the solar plant in their proximity.
The academics said their findings show the importance of the participation of local stakeholders early on in the process of gaining acceptance for the development of solar power plant projects. They said that designers need to take into account status quo bias when co-designing SPPs.
The study did, however, also find that inhabitants who would have a direct view of the project tended to respond more negatively to the design. Those who would have a direct view of the site from their living rooms responded negatively when asked if they would want the project to be built in their backyard.
The findings of the research are available in the paper “Seeing is believing, experiencing is knowing: The influence of a co-designed prototype solar power plant on local acceptance,” which was published in Solar Energy. The authors include researchers from Wageningen University and Research, and the project was supported with funding from the Dutch Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (RVO), within the TKI Urban Energy program.
“Our results suggest that local commitment to the development and support of a solar power plant can be strengthened by ‘possibilities to participate’, the opportunity ‘to affect outcomes’, and to co-design a solar power plant that considers the wishes of local communities,” the academics concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/08/well-irrigated-roofs-with-vegetation-have-cooling-effect-on-pv-systems/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 8, 2023",Well-irrigated roofs with vegetation have cooling effect on PV systems,"A research group led by the Netherlands' KWR Water Research Institute has investigated how a blue-green roof (BGR) may act as a cooling agent for rooftop PV systems and has found that this kind of roof may lower the roof surface temperature by up to 4.64 C compared to a conventional bitumen roof (BiR).
Blue-green roofs are roofs that use “green” technologies, such as lateral drainage and irrigation for plant and crop growth, as well as “blue” technologies like rainwater storage and dosage.
The scientists conducted a series of tests on a PV system installed on a so-called constructed wetroof in an apartment building in Amsterdam. Constructed wetroofs are roofs that use natural processes involving wetland vegetation, soils, and their associated microbial assemblages to improve water quality. The irrigation system used for the research project relies on an additional water supply sourced from grey water from showers that is transformed into irrigation water.
The roof was also equipped with a Permavoid 85s rainwater retention system, a capillary irrigation system, and a substrate layer of 6 cm. “Using the treated grey water, the water level in the water storage layer below the vegetation is kept at a minimum of 50 mm, ensuring a sufficient water supply for the vegetation,” the Dutch group explained, adding that 26 native plant species native were sown on the roof's blankets.
The cooling performance of the BGR was compared to that of a BiR via a system of temperature sensors. Both roofs were equipped with 23.7 kW PV systems using 405 W panels from Chinese manufacturer JinkoSolar. The modules were arranged in a south-facing landscape position with a tilt angle of 20 degrees.

“The panels for detailed monitoring were chosen such that the panels on the blue-green and bitumen roofs are as close together as possible, yet the panels closest to the roof edge are excluded from the study as they will be influenced more by i.e. wind effects and less by vegetation,” the researchers stated.
Through their analysis, the academics found that when temperatures were over 10 C the solar array on the BGR produced more power and a higher energy yield of up to 4.4% at similar irradiance compared to the BiR.
They also noted that the BGR is more exposed to sunlight due to its position. “That means that our results could be on the conservative side, so with similar shadow effects, the BGR could possibly perform even better than measured here,” they stated.
The group's findings were presented in the paper “Increasing solar panel output with blue-green roofs in water-circular and nature inclusive urban development,” which was recently published in Building and Environment.
“Overall, we have shown that a blue-green PV roof creates a win-win-win situation both for PV production, the local water balance as well as biodiversity,” the scientists concluded. “Future research could better investigate wind and albedo effects, different heights of solar panels above the roof and development of the vegetation and the effects of this changing vegetation on PV output.”

Vena Energy says it will collaborate with China's Suntech, battery cell producer REPT Battero, and US energy platform Powin to develop an integrated production line for solar panel and energy storage system components in Indonesia.
The companies said the 2.5 GW framework agreement covers opportunities for the expansion of Indonesia’s renewable energy supply chain, with the components slated for both domestic and export markets. They will also be used in Vena’s solar-storage project being developed at Batam in the Riau Islands.
Vena Energy, which has commissioned 114 MW of solar and onshore wind projects in Indonesia, said the Batam solar power plant will have a capacity of up to 2 GW and will be coupled with battery systems with a potential storage capacity of more than 8 GWh.
Vena Energy Chief Executive Officer Nitin Apte said clean energy generated by the plant will be exported from Batam to Singapore, which is only 30 nautical miles away, with the company having inked a deal with global energy giant Shell. Apte said the company has signed a “collaboration agreement” with Shell for the “cross-border supply” of renewable energy generated by the proposed hybrid megaproject.
Although Vena Energy has yet to provide timeline details for the Batam project, the establishment of local production lines for solar panel and energy storage system components is expected to play a key role in its delivery.
Apte said the companies aim to “significantly contribute” to the development of a productive domestic supply chain in the renewable energy sector. He said the strategy will foster industrial expansion and open export opportunities, as well as support Indonesia’s energy transition plan.
In the latest, “In Conversation” issue of pv magazine we talk to a range of people about their experience with solar, from a sailor and a pair of overland adventurers to a mountain climber and more besides. We also focus on Africa to consider why a continent with such vast solar resource still lags more developed economies when it comes to widespread PV and energy storage rollout.
For Suntech, the agreement builds upon an already established presence in Indonesia.
The Chinese manufacturer is already operating a 500 MW capacity solar module factory in Batam. Suntech said it expects the collaboration with Vena would significantly increase that factory’s capacity.

A recent paper shows that Indonesia has about 140,000 km2 of seascape that has not experienced waves larger than 4 m nor winds stronger than 10 m per second in the past 40 years. This is enough area to generate about 35,000 Terawatt-hours (TWh) of solar energy per year, which is similar to current global electricity production (30,000 TWh per year).
While most of the world’s oceans experience storms, some equatorial regions have a benign maritime environment, which means that extensive and expensive engineering structures to protect offshore floating solar panels are not needed.
High resolution heat maps for the world show that the Indonesian archipelago and equatorial West Africa near Nigeria are the most prospective regions for offshore floating solar power arrays.

By mid-century the global economy will be largely decarbonized and electrified, supported by vast amounts of solar and wind energy. In 2050, Nigeria and Indonesia are forecast to be the third and sixth most populated countries respectively.
Their high population densities could cause conflict between agriculture, the environment and solar energy harvesting. Their tropical location (“in the doldrums”) means that wind resources are poor. Fortunately, these countries (and their neighbors) can harvest unlimited energy from solar panels floating on calm tropical seas that don’t experience strong winds or large waves.
About 70 km2 of solar panels can provide all the energy requirements of a million affluent people in a zero-carbon economy. Less energy-intensive societies will be able to supply energy to more than two million people with the same PV panel area. The panels can be placed on rooftops, in arid areas, co-located with agriculture, and floated on water bodies. Floating solar panels can be located on inland lakes and reservoirs, or in offshore protected areas. Inland floating solar has large potential and is already growing rapidly.
A recently released paper surveys the global oceans to find regions that didn’t experience large waves or strong winds over the last 40 years. Floating solar panels in such regions do not require strong and expensive engineering defenses.
Regions that don't experience waves larger than 6 m nor winds stronger than 15 m/s could generate up to one million TWh per year, which is about 5 times more annual energy than needed for a fully decarbonized global economy supporting 10 billion affluent people.
Most of the good sites are close to the equator, in and around Indonesia and tropical West Africa. These are regions of high population growth and high environmental values. Marine floating solar panels could help resolve land use conflict.
By mid-century, Indonesia’s population may exceed 315 million people. About 25,000 km2 of solar panels would be required to support an affluent Indonesia after full decarbonization of the economy using solar power. Fortunately, Indonesia has vast solar energy potential and also vast pumped hydro energy storage potential to store solar energy overnight.
Indonesia is a densely populated country, particularly in Java, Bali, and Sumatra. Fortunately, Indonesia has the option of floating vast numbers of solar panels on its calm inland sea. Indonesia’s maritime area of 6.4 million km2 is 200 times larger than required if Indonesia’s entire future energy needs were met from offshore floating solar panels.

Most of the global seascape experiences waves larger than 10m and winds stronger than 20 m/s. Several companies are working to develop engineering defenses of offshore floating panels that can tolerate storms. Benign maritime environments along the equator require much less robust and expensive defenses.
The most prospective regions cluster within 5–12 degrees of latitude of the equator, principally in and around the Indonesian archipelago and in the Gulf of Guinea in the vicinity of Nigeria. These regions have low potential for wind generation, high population density, rapid growth in both population and energy consumption, and substantial intact ecosystems that should not be cleared for solar farms. Tropical storms rarely impact equatorial regions.
The economical scope for offshore floating PV in Central and South America is limited by tropical storms and large waves. The Middle East has large technical potential, although there will be strong competition from land-based solar and wind farms. Europe has some prospects in sheltered areas, such as the northern Adriatic Sea and around the Greek Isles.
The offshore floating solar industry is in its infancy.  Offshore solar panels have downsides compared with onshore panels, including salt corrosion and marine fouling. Shallow seas are preferred for anchoring the panels to the seabed. Global warming may alter wind and wave patterns. Careful attention to minimizing the impact on the marine environment and on fishing is required.
Despite these challenges, offshore floating panels could provide a large component of the energy mix for countries with access to calm equatorial seas. By mid-century, about a billion people in these countries will rely mostly on solar energy, which is causing the fastest energy change in history.

The CPUC has  released a proposed decision that could negatively affect the value of rooftop solar for renters in multifamily housing, farms, and schools.
The decision sets hard limits on how much electricity produced by rooftop solar can be self-consumed by multi-meter properties. The policy effectively forces customers to first sell their solar production to the utility, and then buy it back at higher rates.
California’s Virtual Net Metering and Net Energy Metering Aggregation programs allow properties with multiple meters to install a single solar array for the entire property, sharing one system’s electricity and associated net metering credits with all customers and meters on the property. This new proposed decision deems that these customers should be limited in how much of their own solar production they can use, even if it is stored in their own battery.
The decision to not let multi-meter properties consume electricity from a system they own and operate comes with a clear motive: profit protection. If a rooftop solar owner is using their own electricity, they aren’t buying it from the utility. The CPUC has shown time and again that protecting utility profits is chief among its functions in the last year of rooftop solar rulemaking decisions.
“It would force customers in multi-meter properties—such as renters, small farmers, schools, and colleges—to sell all of their generation to the utility at low rates and buy it back at full retail rates,” said the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA).
The proposed decision is scheduled for a CPUC vote on Sept. 21, 2023.
California’s rooftop solar market has already taken heavy blows to demand in recent months as Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 was implemented, a move that dramatically slashed compensation rates for exporting excess solar production to the grid.
Despite warnings from the industry, environmentalists and California residents that the move would be a devastating blow to residential solar, the CPUC moved forward with NEM 3.0, gutting the value of sending excess local solar generation to the grid.
And despite assurances from NEM 3.0 proponents that the industry would weather the storm and readily start attaching batteries to customer systems, demand is now forecast to fall by nearly 40% in California through next year, according to Wood Mackenzie. The problem has been exacerbated by rising interest rates that have worsened the loan packages offered to customers.
The new proposed decision for multi-meter properties is an example of inconsistent logic from CPUC. While NEM 3.0 was justified on grounds that rooftop solar net metering causes cross-subsidization of rooftop solar customers by non-customers, this new ruling would effectively increase the amount of electricity being net metered. The one consistency: both rulemaking decisions are beneficial to utility profits.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/08/average-rooftop-solar-system-sizes-surpass-9-kw-in-australia/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 8, 2023",Average rooftop solar system sizes surpass 9 kW in Australia,"From pv magazine Australia
The size of rooftop solar installations continues to rise, with Australian Energy Council (AEC) analysis of the Clean Energy Regulator’s (CER) latest Quarterly Carbon Market Report revealing that the average size of a rooftop PV system installed in Australia in the second quarter of 2023 was 9.3 kW. This is up on the first quarter of 2023 average of 8.7 kW and well above the acknowledged norm of 6.6 kW.
Households in the Northern Territory installed some of the largest rooftop systems rolled out in the second quarter, with systems hitting a high of 14.1 kW during the 1 April to 30 June 2023 period. Queensland and South Australia were next with average system size in both states reaching 10.1 kW during the term.
The AEC said the growth of system size continues a trend seen in recent years with Australian households and businesses keen to take advantage of technology advancements and decreasing costs in the market in their search for greater energy independence.
At the end of the second quarter, Australia’s total installed solar rooftop capacity had reached 20.5 GW with more than 61,000 new installations added to the grid in the three months with a total installed capacity of 520 MW.
The number of installations is down on the 80,300 rooftop PV systems installed in the first quarter of 2023, but the AEC said it expects the second-quarter figures will be revised upwards, noting that the data reporting has a 12-month lag.
“Based on projections, the final figures are expected to be even higher, with approximately 91,000 new rooftop installations expected to be recorded by the end of the reporting period,” it said. “This surge in installations is also projected to lead to a total installed capacity of 827 MW, further indicating the growing adoption of rooftop solar solutions in the second quarter of 2023.”
New South Wales homeowners led Australia in terms of newly installed rooftop solar systems, with 33.1% of the national total for the quarter. They were followed by Queensland and Victoria, with 26.1% and 17% of the total installations, respectively.
The AEC said the improved take-up came despite increasing interest rates which is estimated to have pushed out the payback period for solar systems by 12 months.
