Sparc Hydrogen is researching technology which would see green hydrogen produced by only sunlight and water – photocatalytic water splitting coupled with solar radiation – instead of renewable energy and electrolysis. The process is known as Thermo-Photocatalysis. FFI’s initial investment of AU$1.8 million (US$1.28 million) will give it a 20% interest in the Sparc Hydrogen joint venture formed with Sparc Technologies and the University of Adelaide. FFI could invest a further AU$1.47 million (US$1.04 million) to own up to a 36% interest. “Sparc Hydrogen’s promising early-stage technology has the potential to create significant energy efficiencies and a cost-competitive advantage with low capital and operating expenditure required, compared to renewable energy and electrolysis,” a press release about the initiative stated. FFI is building an electrolyzer factory in Gladstone, Queensland, with the company stating “the first sod [is] due to be turned this month.” 
Ireland-based, U.K.-headquartered Linde has signed a long-term agreement with German fellow chemical company BASF for the supply of hydrogen and steam in France. Linde will build and operate a new hydrogen production facility at Chalampé to supply BASF’s new hexamethylenediamine manufacturing facility. Linde expects the plant to go on stream in the first half of 2024.
Nel Hydrogen U.S., a subsidiary of Oslo-based hydrogen business Nel, has received a contract for a containerized polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer and a light-duty hydrogen fueling station package, from an unnamed U.S. power utility. “The project will demonstrate several use cases for green hydrogen, including cooling of the turbine generators, direct injection of hydrogen into the natural gas fuel stream at the plant, and for fueling a fleet of light-duty fuel cell vehicles to be operated by the utility,” Nel said last week. “Power for the electrolyzer will come from various sources, including an on-site solar PV array.” The equipment will be delivered within a year.
Fukuoka City and Toyota Motor have signed a partnership agreement to promote initiatives to create a hydrogen society in Japan. “As a first step, they have commenced discussions regarding the introduction of fuel cell vehicles,” Toyota wrote yesterday. As part of the project, the city “launched the world’s first initiative to produce hydrogen from public household sewage and supply it to fuel cell vehicles.” The city has already undertaken verification tests for trucks and motorcycles equipped with fuel cell technologies.
The Hamburg Port Authority (HPA) and U.S.-headquartered industrial gas company Air Products have signed a memorandum of understanding to explore opportunities to establish a hydrogen value chain in northern Germany. “Northern Germany and Hamburg are particularly suitable for a green hydrogen sector, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), mainly due to [their] regional advantages and a large off-take potential of resident industrial companies,” HPA wrote yesterday. Several companies have showed interest in the port’s hydrogen potential including Shell, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
Shell’s maritime subsidiary and France-based cryogenic containment systems designer GTT have teamed up to develop new technologies to enable the transportation of liquid hydrogen (LH2). “This includes the development by GTT of a preliminary LH2 carrier design as well as an LH2 cargo containment system for [a] mid-size LH2 carrier,” GGT wrote today. 
Californian carbon-free aviation bsuiness Universal Hydrogen has signed a letter of intent with Paris-based airline Amelia for three ATR 72-600 aircraft, hydrogen conversion kits. “This announcement follows Amelia’s November 2021 launch of Amelia Green, an internal pledge from the airline to actively find sustainable options to decrease its carbon output,” the companies wrote last week. After the installation of the conversion kits, Universal Hydrogen and Amelia will enter a contract. Universal will then provide hydrogen fuel to power Amelia’s ATR fleet on an ongoing basis.
Portugal’s Keme Energy has contracted 4.8ha in Sines Industrial and Logistics Zone to install a 2.52MW green hydrogen production plant. The €5.2 million (US$5.95 million) investment will be based on electrochemical electrolysis. It will compress and store the gas in PED bottles. The first part of the project, already approved and supported, will have a total capacity of 1.26MW. The hydrogen would be used by industry and for electricity production. “Considering the total value of green hydrogen production and the pilot project nature, success may result in its replication in other locations nationwide,” wrote Aicep Global Parques, the manager of the Sines industrial complex today. “This project will be a net contributor to the national industry decarbonization targets.”
Annual government funding for hydrogen has reached US$16 billion per year globally, up 40% from July. “This puts it two-thirds of the way to where it needs to be in order for clean hydrogen to play a strong decarbonizing role in the economy,” BloombergNEF wrote in its market outlook for the first half of 2022. “Electrolyzer sales have more than doubled to 458MW in 2021 and are set to grow 4-5 times this year. Almost two-thirds of these sales will happen in China. Globally, BNEF's database now tracks 122GW of planned electrolyzer projects, up from 50GW in July 2021,” the analyst said, adding stronger policies in favor of decarbonization will still be needed to maintain growth.

Indian manufacturer Saatvik Solar, which is aiming for 3GW of annual photovoltaic equipment production output by the end of next year, has reached 1GW through the addition of a 500MW mono PERC panel factory in the state of Haryana. The new production base is equipped to make mono PERC, half-cut, multi-busbar technology to produce high-efficiency solar modules with a power output of 530-610Wp, the company said.
Saatvik is setting up an additional 1.2GW of solar production capacity in the city of Gandhidham, in Gujarat state, by the end of March next year and has said it plans to create an “eco system” featuring module and cell manufacturing.
The company will then add a further 800MW of production capacity by the end of next year, to achieve its 3GW ambition.
“As a part of the government plan to achieve 280GW of solar capacity by 2030, and to bring cutting-edge technology to India for manufacturing high-efficiency modules, we have just added 500MW [of] mono PERC, half-cut, MBB [multi-busbar] technology to produce high-efficiency solar PV modules,” said Saatvik CEO Prashant Mathur. “Further, we are setting up a greenfield manufacturing project in Gandhidham, Gujarat, to raise manufacturing output to 3GW by 2023.”
This copy was amended on 09/02/22 to indicate when the final 800MW of production capacity needed to hit the 3GW target would arrive.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/08/doped-carbon-for-a-reliable-lithium-sulfur-battery/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SOUTH KOREA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"FEBRUARY 8, 2022",Doped carbon for a reliable lithium sulfur battery,"There is no shortage of materials promising to kick off “the next generation” in energy storage. Among these, lithium-sulfur batteries have proved popular among researchers and commercial developers, with the potential for higher capacity than today’s energy storage technology, while replacing some of the rare, valuable materials used in batteries with cheap, abundant sulfur.
Lithium-sulfur batteries, however, tend to be limited by a side effect known as polysulfide shuttling, which leads to sulfur leaking from the cathode as the battery cycles, rapidly reducing its performance. Different solutions have been suggested for this, many involving the use of conductive nanomaterials to mitigate the shuttling effect.
Scientists led by Pusan National University in South Korea developed one such material, beginning with methylene blue – a common organic salt used in textile dyeing and various other applications. The group dissolved methylene blue into a solvent, and used heat and plasma to produce a porous carbon material, doped with both nitrogen and sulfur. This material was then applied to the separator film placed between the cathode and anode a lithium-sulfur battery. The fabrication and application of the coating are described in full in the paper Plasma-engineered organic dyes as efficient polysulfide-mediating layers for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries, published in Chemical Engineering Journal.
Batteries manufactured with the coating achieved a specific capacity of 1,329 milliamp hours per gram (mAh g−1) and retained specific capacity of 669 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.3 degrees Celsius. While the battery would need to retain a much higher portion of its capacity after 100 cycles to catch the eye of commercial battery developers, the results serve as proof of concept for the approach, and should inspire further research. “This work highlights the potential application of this heteroatom-doped carbon material in Li-S batteries, as well as the viability of dye compound-derived carbon materials in energy storage devices,” the group noted.
Beyond lithium-sulfur, the group speculates that its approach could be useful in other energy storage technologies, and that other organic dye substances may also be worth investigating for similar applications. “Our findings show that methylene blue, and possibly other dyes, can be useful in next-generation energy storage systems,” said Seung Geol Lee, Professor of Organic Material Science & Engineering at Pusan National University. “We expect our results to greatly contribute to the manufacturing of not only lithium-sulfur batteries but also various other energy storage systems such as sodium-ion batteries, in which carbon materials can be used.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/08/solarpower-europe-calls-on-italy-to-abandon-measure-introduced-to-halt-rocketing-energy-price/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY",MAX HALL,"FEBRUARY 8, 2022",SolarPower Europe calls on Italy to abandon measure introduced to halt rocketing energy price,"Trade body SolarPower Europe has called on the Italian government to abandon an emergency measure introduced late last month to protect electricity users from soaring bills.
Article 16 of Italian Law Decree 04/22, published on Jan. 27, replaces generator payments linked to the current high wholesale energy prices with fixed returns based on average historic tariffs across different zones of Italy.
The government introduced the measure to shield electricity users from the impact of skyrocketing bills driven by surging international gas prices but SolarPower Europe said the dampening effect it will have on solar plant owner income will further hold back the energy transition in a nation where sluggish permitting is already a deterrant to renewables.

Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.

A post published on the website of the European solar membership body on Thursday called for Article 16 to be removed as it could lead to government, rather than market-led, fixed prices for future solar power purchase agreements and said the emergency legislation would shake the confidence of clean energy investors, jeopardize the EU's emission reduction ambitions, and hinder the functioning of the bloc's internal electricity market.
SolarPower Europe said Article 16 is incompatible with a toolbox of measures the European Commission suggested EU member states could use to protect electricity users from rising bills, although the trade body did not spell out how the Italian measure was incompatible.
And the membership body said similar interventions made by the governments of Spain and Romania last year had been reined back in scope because of the instability they introduced into electricity markets. Reuters in September reported on the Spanish government's emergency measure to transfer billions of euros banked by energy companies in extraordinary profits to make payments to consumers and to cap energy prices.
SolarPower Europe said Article 16 affects the “vast majority” of solar projects in Italy, which receive feed-in tariffs under the nation's various Conto Energia laws. Unsubsidized, “merchant” solar plants will also, like incentivized plants, receive a fixed return for each unit of electricity generated for the remainder of the year, based on historic average prices, rather than being able to take advantage of high tariffs on the wholesale market where their energy is usually sold, although exceptions were made for PPA-driven projects whose tariffs are not linked to spot market energy prices.
SolarPower Europe said the Italian government should “initiate a constructive dialogue to define effective and balanced solutions to tackle the energy price rises.”
This copy was amended on 08/02/22 to reflect the Italian measure affects solar plants in receipt of feed-in tariffs under Conto Energia legislation, rather than feed-in premium payments, as previously stated. The fact PPA-led facilities not linked to the spot energy price are not covered by the measure has also been added to the information published by SolarPower Europe.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/08/goodwe-global-solar-installations-could-exceed-240gw-in-2022/,"INVERTERS,CHINA",VINCENT SHAW,"FEBRUARY 8, 2022",GoodWe: Global solar installations could exceed 240GW in 2022,"Shen Rong, Vice President of GoodWe: Generally speaking, the PV market experienced growth globally. However, there were some unexpected issues in 2021, which negatively impacted the industry. In early 2021, polysilicon supply started to affect downstream costs, especially PV module prices. In the middle of the year, the supply of chips, especially the Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) – a key component of inverters – was compromised and caused problems for inverter manufacturers.
For some chips, we tried to purchase them from alternative suppliers, which cost us a lot in terms of time and expenditures to find qualified vendors. But for IGBT modules, there are not many alternative options. One major IGBT supplier shut down its factories in Vietnam and Malaysia for over three months due to the pandemic in the middle of the year and this caused a serious supply problem. We had enough sales orders, but shipments were affected.
I think in 2022 the supply issues will continue in Q1 or even H1, but will gradually improve in the following months.
In the first half of the year, due to the continuous price rises, we saw many PV projects postponed while developers waited for price drops. However, in the second half of the year, many people changed their minds. For the first time in the past 20 years, the industry experienced a price rise which challenged the expectation of ever-falling prices. And then we saw some people start to buy due to fear of inflation, which pushed solar projects forward, especially in the distributed PV market. Because GoodWe focuses on distributed and residential PV, we didn’t have trouble with orders.
As one of the earliest players in storage, GoodWe has plenty of experience in this market. And with the rapid growth of the market, we also saw fast growth in 2021. We achieved very good sales revenues in our traditional EU markets. Furthermore, we started to gain momentum in other markets which have been in progress for a while, like the US and Australia. GoodWe gained brand recognition and achieved significant growth here.
GoodWe used to provide only PCS storage inverters for our customers when deploying their storage systems and we gained a good reputation in the field. However, along with the successful commissioning of a new factory manufacturing our own battery systems, we have started to provide more integrated storage systems under the GoodWe brand name.
Furthermore, we invested in R&D for integrating different parts of a storage system like BMS, EMS, and data from inverters, and built up the smart energy management system (SEMS) and all other applications on this platform, which we believe will be utilized widely in future.
By the end of 2022, when our phase II Guangde base is finished, our capacity will reach up to 25GW annually. We are also considering setting up overseas production bases, which will be evaluated in terms of location, trading barriers, local market conditions, etc.; however, the pandemic has currently stopped us from taking action on overseas expansion.
Like before, 70% of GoodWe’s revenue comes from overseas markets. We did great work in several key European markets like Italy, Germany, Spain, Poland, and the Netherlands. In Australia, GoodWe ranked among the top two inverter brands. This is not only referring to inverter shipments but also to brand recognition, based on a third-party survey report. We also achieved good scores in emerging markets. In Korea, for instance, we met the market trend for large size panel types with our latest inverter. In Brazil, our growth is as high as 100% over the last year. And in India, considering the price sensitivity, we provided diversified competitive products for our Indian customers. One very important market is the US which we believe will be a fast-growing one for GoodWe in 2022.
I don’t see any big concerns in developing the US market. In a series of deployment experiments of our US products, we saw very good performance. I think it’s just a matter of time for US customers, end-users, and installers to recognize the brand and products.
Generally, one of our concerns is the safety and reliability of our inverter products. For example, an arc fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) is essential to meet safety requirements. In the US, the AFCI function is mandatory. In the EU and our domestic market, this is also becoming more and more demanded by either end-users or financial institutions like insurance companies to support a project’s bankability. With long-time research, GoodWe has taken the lead in this area. We have introduced our advanced AFCI functionalities into all our inverter products for customers.
On the other hand, we have also invested a lot in smart energy management systems to build up our soft power, which will eventually become our core competence.
From the perspective of products, we are now focusing on utility level string inverters which will help GoodWe to explore the utility-scale PV market.
We expect that the supply chain issues will continue into 2022 and gradually be solved. Along with the release of new manufacturing capacities from polysilicon to wafers, solar cells, and panels, prices will decrease and boost installations. As for inverter production, domestic chip suppliers will take some shares. Considering the carbon emission targets of overseas markets and the construction of renewable energy bases in China, the demand for solar PV will be very strong. We believe there will be a 30-40% increase for overseas installations. For China, it will be higher, maybe a 100% increase. Global installations may well exceed 240GW in 2022.

Italian legal firm Gatteschi has been hired by Fimer to implement a debt restructuring process. “The proceedings are intended at reaching a debt restructuring agreement,” the law firm's partner, Marcello Catacchini, told pv magazine. “All will be managed in full and complete business continuity without any interruption of operational activity.”
Fimer had acquired the inverter business of Swiss conglomerate ABB in March 2020. “This was at the beginning of the serious pandemic that has impacted the whole world,” a company's spokesperson told pv magazine. “This ambitious and complex turnaround deal was slowed down and impacted by the difficulties connected to the health emergency and to the consequent supply chain crisis.”
The manufacturer claims to have been impacted, in particular, by the post-pandemic supply constraints. “Imposed lockdowns, raw material shortages and a reduction in supply chain capacity resulted in increased operating costs and delivery times,” the spokesperson went on to say. “These reasons have led Fimer to face a difficult period in finding raw materials, components and batteries, as well as having to deal with constantly and strongly growing purchase and logistic prices, thus causing delays in the production and products delivery.”
The creditor protection proceedings should be completed by May 4. “We decided to resort to this protective procedure for the best protection of the company and all creditors, during which the company’s Italian production facilities will continue to operate and manufacture products for customers worldwide,” the spokesperson stated.
“This strategic move will allow Fimer to restructure and recapitalise its Italian business operations to ensure that the Company emerges in a stronger financial structure following the impact of Covid-19 and we are confident that this move will secure the future of Fimer, so that we can continue to drive a greener future globally for our employees, channels, suppliers and most importantly, our customers,” the company's director, Filippo Carzaniga, told pv magazine. “With a solid plan now in place, a huge orders portfolio, management is restructuring the business to restore financial stability and fast-track production lines to get back quickly to full operational capacity, ensure continuity in stock globally and bring a number of exciting innovations to market.”

Highly Efficient and Reliable Inverter Concept (HERIC) is the name of a circuit and the associated process that Heribert Schmidt and his colleagues from Germany's Fraunhofer ISE invented in 2002 and that is protected by patents in Europe and the USA. According to the research institute, the topology is used in single-phase inverters, for example in photovoltaic roof systems, and enables very high efficiencies of up to 99% with low interference emissions with little additional effort, compared to conventional inverters. In addition to the higher energy yield, the advantages are lower thermal stress for the components, smaller heat sinks, and longer service life.
The Fraunhofer ISE estimates that more than 80% of all single-phase inverters used worldwide are based on its HERIC topology, although in many cases its use is not allowed. “A large number of manufacturers have used the circuitry or the process in its original form or in modified versions that nevertheless infringe the patent without the consent of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. The latter was confirmed by the Munich I Regional Court,” said Fraunhofer ISE in a statement.
The institute said it has secured seven patent infringement settlements against companies from China, Taiwan and Germany, all of them out-of-court. As a result of the settlements, Fraunhofer ISE receives payments for the licensing of its HERIC topology and the companies making the payments are allowed to continue selling their products.
“The infringement of IP rights of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft is, therefore, not worthwhile for infringers. IP from Germany is in many products of the photovoltaic industry and not infrequently the patents on them are infringed. We are prepared to take action against patent infringements,” said Andreas Bett, director of the Fraunhofer ISE. “As the infringement proceedings have shown, it would also have been economically worthwhile for the companies concerned to take care of a license at an early stage.”

The electric company last month asked regulator the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board – part of the provincial government – for permission to apply a monthly “system access charge” of CA$8 (US$6.29) per kilowatt of solar generation capacity installed by customers who participate in net metering, a system which sees them rewarded for excess electricity they generate which is fed into the grid.
With the charge due to be introduced from Feb. 1 next year, the provincial government on Wednesday announced regulation would be passed before that date to prevent household and commercial solar “prosumers” – who produce and consume electricity – from having to pay the fee. The Nova Scotia government also pledged to deliver further pro-solar measures, with the office of Nova Scotia premier Tim Houston stating: “These enhancements will make solar power more accessible to everyone, including renters, small businesses and marginalized communities. These changes will also allow for larger solar projects for communities, farms and businesses.”
This month’s edition of pv magazine – out today – takes a deep dive into the world of electromobility, with 22 pages of analysis taking in the market growth and expectations for electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide; how electricity networks will need to grow and adapt to make room for the electrification of transport; and the vital role for solar in all of this. We examine the growing trend for residential and commercial EV chargers linked to PV and optimized to make the most of solar kilowatt-hours, and take a look at some of the early movers working on vehicle-integrated PV – from solar sunroofs to full integration in vehicle bodywork. We also consider a range of e-mobility applications, from commercial trucks to family cars to electric bikes and other “last mile” delivery vehicles.
The move to block the net metering charge was welcomed by the Canadian Renewable Energy Association (CanREA), which said it would have removed around 60% of the economic value of solar arrays affected, driving up the payback period for such systems from 10-12 years to more than 20.
With the province aiming for 80% of its electricity to come from renewables this decade, Nova Scotia minister for natural resources and renewables, Tory Rushton, said: “We have come too far in our fight against climate change and expanding access to renewable energy to risk that progress. The changes we will bring forward will stop the proposed system access charge in its tracks today and provide certainty for our solar industry and rate-paying families investing in solar.”
CanREA recently published the nation's renewable energy statistics for 2021, which showed 288MW of utility scale solar plants were installed and the trade body said it expects more than 3GW of solar and wind capacity to be added this year and a similar figure next year.
The 677MW of wind capacity added last year took Canada to a 965MW new renewables figure which was the largest in the state since 2015, with the province of Alberta providing more than 60% of the clean energy facilities, and Saskatchewan 20%.
The trade body has estimated, though, Canada would need more than 5GW of new renewables capacity annually to achieve carbon neutrality in mid century.

Spain's National Confederation of Installers (CNI) has published a technical paper about the potential of solar-powered heat pumps in the Spanish energy market.
The document aims to offer technical assistance to all companies active in the segment in Spain, while providing specific guidelines for proper deployment.
“Heat pumps are defined by the current regulations for thermal installations in buildings (RITE) as reference systems, as they offer an extremely high performance that is not comparable to those of a combustion boiler,” said Javier Ponce, a member of the association's technical committee and the author of the paper. “Today it is not possible to design a thermal installation that is efficient without a large contribution from renewables on its thermal production.”
He said that a residential PV system deployed without a heat pump in Spain has a payback period ranging from six to 10 years, but coupling the array with a heat pump means it can be repaid in less than five years. In addition, if the heat pump produces hot water for a household, works efficiently for low-temperature systems such as radiant floors, and also produces cooling during the summer, the payback time could range between two and three years.
The paper explains the seasonal performance of heat pumps, describes their electrical energy consumption, and the photovoltaic contribution. It also brings together the key factors for the success of an installation, and the steps to develop a self-consumption system.

Silicon is already well established, accounting for around 95% of the solar cells on the market. So the bulk of the work on tandem cells has focused on the new, yet to be commercialized, perovskite element. On the silicon side, researchers have most often chosen heterojunction (HJT) cells as these offer the simplest route to high efficiency. Most of the silicon cells currently being produced, however, use passivated emitter rear cell (PERC) technology, so integrating perovskite with these would have much higher industrial reach, and has already been shown to work well.
“PERC technology as the current industrial standard is a very promising option to evolve into a low-cost tandem device,” said a group of scientists led by Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE. “However, the pathway towards an optimized tandem device based on PERC technology (Pero-PERC) needs to be further investigated.” The group’s latest work, a paper titled How to make PERC suitable for perovskite–silicon tandem solar cells: A simulation study, published in Progress in Photovoltaics, simulates the behavior of five different PERC-like cell concepts in tandem devices, noting advantages and constraints for each, and guidelines for optimization.
The group evaluated five variations on the PERC cell structure, focusing on potential upgrades to the front side of the silicon cell. They note that their integration into a tandem device will change both the light-absorbing and charge carrying characteristics of the silicon cell, allowing for optimizations that would improve the overall efficiency. “One aspect is the option to significantly reduce recombination and transport losses, because of the increased design freedom concerning blue response, the higher series resistance tolerance, and the fact that for monolithic 2-terminal tandems, no lateral transport at the front side is needed,” they explain. “This is an important factor to close the efficiency gap to SHJ bottom cells that are currently applied in record tandem devices but still lack industrial maturity.”
Several of the cell concepts investigated made use of tunnel-oxide passivation, making them more similar to the TOPCon cells currently being introduced in large-scale production. The group noted that such cells could reach efficiencies up to 30.5%, but would require development of new transparent electrode materials, while working with the full TOPCon cell structure could offer a solution to this.

The plant is part of the 1,158 MW Tâmega complex under construction since 2014, which comprises three water reservoirs – Gouvães, Daivões and Alto Tâmega – and three hydroelectric power plants located on the Tâmega river, a tributary of the Duero in the north of Portugal, close to Oporto. “After eight years of construction work, the Gouvães and Daivões plants have now been completed and all of the generating units are currently undergoing commissioning tests,” the company said in a statement.
The complex also includes an 880 MW pumped-hydro storage facility, which Iberdrola said will raise Portugal's storage capacity by 30%. “When the Gouvães and Daivões plants are fully operational in the middle of this year, the large Tâmega giga battery will have enough storage capacity to supply two million Portuguese households for an entire day, and will contribute to the decarbonization and energy independence objectives set by the Portuguese government,” it further explained. “In 2024, with the commissioning of Alto Tâmega, the facility will be fully completed.”
The Daivões dam is the lower reservoir of the 880 MW reversible storage facility, which is able to store water from the Daivões reservoir in the Gouvães reservoir, taking advantage of the 650 meters height difference between the two.
The €1.5 billion Tâmega project will also be connected to two wind power facilities totaling 300 MW.

The novel technology was originally conceived for use in Seaborg’s next-generation advanced nuclear reactor, the Compact Molten Salt Reactor. But it acquired a life of its own when the company's experts developed a chemistry control method that holds the corrosion by sodium hydroxide at bay.
“Normally no chemist in their right mind would look at anything as corrosive as sodium hydroxide,” Seaborg CEO, Troels Schönfeldt, told pv magazine. “However, in the development of our reactor, we needed to use sodium hydroxide and were forced to develop these methods.”
Sodium hydroxide can be produced at low cost from seawater as a byproduct from chlorine production. Seaborg said this is six times cheaper that standard salts used for storage.
“Hydroxides can contain more heat per salt unit, making it more efficient and reducing the amount of salt needed compared to current salt uses,” the company explained. “This reduces the cost of salt as a storage medium by approximately 90%”.
Sodium hydroxide is produced across the globe in bulk, as a byproduct part of the alkali chloride process. Normally, bulk price would be around $150 per ton, or around $0.75 per kWh as a volumetric storage price for the storage medium.
The proposed storage system uses renewable energy to heat the salt using electrical heaters. It is based on two-tank molten salt storage designs developed for concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. It has a scalable storage capacity from 250MWh to 5GWh. A 1GWh facility with sodium hydroxides is expected to be able to store heat to produce power and heat for around 100,000 households for 10 hours of discharge.
The two tanks are able to store electricity as heat at 700 C. The high temperature provides large flexibility for how energy can be extracted back out, including Rankine cycle combined heat-and-power production, Brayton cycle heat-to-power, heat storage for district heating, and industrial process heat.
The immersion heaters are used to store excess electricity as heat, while pumps control the flow for discharging through salt to steam heat exchangers for producing steam to drive steam turbines for co-generation in the simplest setup. Seaborg said this storage system may have a maximum heat loss down to 0.5% to 1% per day and its charge and discharge are freely scalable. Its costs should be between 30% and 50% lower than conventional molten salt storage. Hyme believes it could  halve the price of long-term and large-scale energy storage facilities regardless of the geographical location.
“We are pursuing the commercialization of hydroxides as the key component in large-scale energy storage,” said Hyme CEO Ask Emil Løvschall-Jensen, noting that the first pilot manufacturing facility should be operational within 18 months.
Hyme has received backing from the Danish Energy Agency to build the pilot plant at a test site in Esbjerg, Denmark – an area well-known as a very favorable geographical site for wind power, with large offshore projects already in operation. The pilot plant will be built by Hyme together with project partners including SAN Electro, Alfa Laval and Sulzer, as well as regional district heating supplier DIN Forsyning.

The outcry following the revelation that Shell would buy Australia’s “greenest” power company revealed a sizable shift in Australia’s understanding of greenwashing and corporate responsibility.
In the month after the takeover was announced, the ABC gathered data to estimate that Powershop had lost 6,000 of its 185,000 customers across New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland.
Social media raged with the news that a fossil fuel giant would take over the company, which Greenpeace ranked first in its Green Electricity Guide published in 2018. Activism group GetUp ran a campaign on the corporate takeover, encouraging customers to switch providers – a call which seems to have been heeded with minor “green electricity” retailers reporting spikes in new customers over the last three months. GetUp! launched a major campaign encouraging Powershop customers to abandon the company, which could no longer reasonably be seen as “green.”
As of Feb. 1, Shell’s takeover of Powershop Australia was completed nonetheless, clearing the final regulatory steps. The company will now operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell under the Powershop brand within the Shell Energy business in Australia, which is part of Shell’s Global Renewables and Energy Solutions business.
Shell bought the business after teaming up with Australian investment manager Infrastructure Capital Group to take over Powershop’s partner company, Meridian Energy Australia, a subsidiary of New Zealand-based company Meridian Energy. The price Shell paid for Powershop, and its certified clean and green credentials, remains undisclosed.

In a recent presentation, titled Managed Sheep Grazing Can Improve Soil Quality and Carbon Sequestration at Solar Photovoltaic Sites, researchers from Temple University investigated the effects of periodic sheep grazing on soil properties. Micro and macro nutrients, carbon storage, and soil grain size distribution at six commercial solar PV sites were compared to undisturbed control sites.
The authors point to existing studies which show biomass production of forage species under shade (e.g Pang et al, 2019 Agroforest Syst (2019) 93:11–24) Data from the: Horticulture and Agroforestry Research Center (HARC), New Franklin, Missouri. One of the more interesting findings of this research describes the relationship between levels of shading and the biomass production of various plants, shown in the chart below. The analysis found that the ‘meaningful forage productivity’ of most of their chosen ruminant appropriate species significantly increased under 45% shade, while most plants under 80% shade saw a marked decrease in biomass volume.

The results align with prior research from the University of Oregon, which found that solar panels altered the microclimate variables of mean air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and soil moisture. This improved water efficiency, allowing for much greater biomass growth, drove a 90% increase in grasses for sheep and cows.
The extensive list of plants examined is a definite positive, as the rate of installation for ground-mount solar power accelerates. Efforts are currently being made by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture and University of Illinois to determine which row crops, foraging crops, and specialty crops are best to couple with solar panels in agrivoltaic settings.
In this project’s case, land at the facility has been managed by the Minnesota Native Landscapes’ Conservation Grazing Program. Their approach to regenerative land management relies on the planned impact of livestock grazing. This approach gives holistic consideration to the type of soil and plants, as well as the animals which will be grazing, with an eye towards rehabilitating the soil over time. The group works with sheep, bison, cattle, and goats in their land conservation programs.
Across the six sites, researchers allowed 500-700 sheep to graze the sites two to three times per year.
The researchers’ early estimates suggest that an acre of grazed native plants may improve soil at a rate of one ton of sequestered carbon per year, and that carbon and other nutrients may accumulate for 12 to 15 years before the soil is fully saturated.

The total exchange capacity of the soil (a soil fertility measurement based on how many cations can be retained on soil surfaces) showed a marked improvement at four of the six sites, and an overall increase in the estimated nitrogen release, ammonia, and nitrate was found at all but one of the sites. A similar increase was seen in other nutrients as well, including Mg, Na, K, P, Ca, and S.
This data points in the same direction as an analysis of Upper Midwest solar power facilities integrating natural prairie grasses, which sequester roughly half a ton of carbon per acre without livestock. That study demonstrated a 65% greater carbon retention compared to a purely agricultural scenario, and 35% improvement over a solar-turfgrass scenario.

Australia’s battery capacity is set to double this year, growing to 1.1 GW as many utility-scale storage projects become operational in the second half of 2022, data from Rystad Energy reported by AFR shows.
Neoen currently dominates Australia’s big battery landscape, with the 150MW/194MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve and now the 300MW/450MWh Victorian Big Battery. There are a number of other players though currently in the process of constructing battery storage projects, most notably in Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales, many of which are slated for completion this year.

In December 2020, analysts at Cornwall Insight Australia pegged Australia’s battery energy storage (BESS) pipeline at 7 GW. By the end of 2021, its research showed Australia’s pipeline of proposed storage had grown enormously to over 26 GW.
