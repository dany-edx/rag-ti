That statement tallies with the remarks made by Jinko chairman and CEO Xiande Li, who wrote in yesterday's update: “Due to the transition to renewable energy in most regions of the world; the increase in electricity prices; financing support; and other favorable policies, clients are more willing to accept higher module prices.”
Elsewhere in the earnings update, Jinko said it had doubled the extent of its slice of the Chinese PV module market between the second and third quarters and it hopes to achieve more than 50% growth in annual shipments next year.
Jinko is also forging ahead with production capacity expansion, perhaps not surprisingly after the company saw solar cell manufacturing costs fall more than 10% in Q3 after the more-than-7 GW of production lines it switched on in the previous window were cranked up to full capacity.
With 31 GW of annual wafer manufacturing capacity online at the end of September, plus 19 GW of cell lines and 36 GW of module facilities, Jinko plans to raise those numbers to 32.5 GW, 24 GW, and 45 GW, respectively, by the end of December. Of the cell production lines, 940 MW were devoted to manufacturing the company's n-type, high efficiency components and Jinko wants that number to leap to 16 GW in the first three months of the new year.
The manufacturer also trailed the fact its 7 GW monosilicon wafer production fab in Vietnam is due online within the next four months, and would give it the same volume of joined up wafer, cell and module facilities outside China.
In terms of the numbers, Jinko shipped 4,993 MW of product in the last quarter, including 4,671 MW of modules. That was slightly less than it shifted in April-to-June thanks to “logistical issues and blockages.” The company expects to move another 7-8.5 GW of modules in the current window – and total solar system shipments of 7.3-8.8 GW – for an expected full-year figure of 22.8-24-3 GW.
Third-quarter revenue came in at RMB8.57 billion ($1.19 billion) – up 8.1%, quarter on quarter – for a gross profit of RMB1.3 billion ($180 million), and net income of RMB194 million ($26.9 million), almost treble the figure recorded in April-to-June. Jinko anticipates it will generate revenue of $1.8-2.2 billion ($250-305 million) for the full year.
Although the company balance sheet took a hit to the tune of almost RMB11 billion ($1.53 billion) less in total assets since the end of 2020, that was almost counterbalanced by a RMB10 billion ($1.39 billion) fall in total liabilities.
And the directors also offered up their thoughts on polysilicon, described as “currently in its most severe shortage,” by stating: “We expect polysilicon supply will gradually return to sufficient levels, starting next year.”
* This copy was amended on 01/12/21 after Jinko contacted pv magazine to confirm it had not reduced module prices in Q3.

Germany's Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) has allocated 512 MW of capacity in the tender for PV projects with installed power ranging from 750 kW to 20 MW, held on November 2.
The tender, as with all previous rounds, was largely oversubscribed, with 232 bids with a combined capacity of 986 MW having been submitted.
The round's final prices range between €0.0457 and €0.052/kWh and the final average price was €0.05/kWh. This price level remained almost unchanged compared to that of the previous auction of the same kind.
This is a bit surprising as currently rising module prices and the supply bottlenecks for solar products due to production cuts in China – as well as due to logistics difficulties – mean higher bid values could not be ruled out.
The big winner of the tendering round was once again the southern region of Bavaria, with 255 MW of assigned capacity. Of these, 172 MW were for photovoltaic systems on low-grade arable and grassland areas. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Baden-Württemberg followed, with 51 and 49 MW, respectively.
The next tender round will be held in the first half of next year. Developers will have until March 1 to submit their bids.

Some of the largest electrolyzers of this new kind are already operating in Europe.” On the first day of the event, European Union officials said the bloc should surpass its 2030 targets, capitalizing on the opportunity offered by high natural gas prices. “Because of the current rise in gas prices we all see, green hydrogen today can even be cheaper than grey hydrogen,” von der Leyen said yesterday. The EU also wants to work with Ukraine.
British energy company BP has said it is planning HyGreen Teesside, a new large scale hydrogen facility in the North East of England which could deliver up to 500 tons of hydrogen production this decade. “BP is aiming to start production by 2025, with an initial phase of some 60 MWe of installed hydrogen production capacity,” said the company yesterday. “A final investment decision on the project is expected in 2023.” BP added the project will produce a mix of green and natural gas-plus-carbon-capture, blue hydrogen. The combined 1.5 GW capacity of HyGreen Teesside and H2Teesside could deliver 30% of the U.K. government’s 5 GW-by-2030 hydrogen production ambition.

Petroleum Development Oman wants to lead the kingdom's bid to become a hydrogen hub, according to representatives of the company who held a green hydrogen press conference this week. State-owned entities the energy group OQ, of Oman, and South Korea's Kogas Tech last week signed a memorandum of understanding to work in the sector. Energy pricing company S&P Global Platts last week launched a daily hydrogen pricing assessment for Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. Oman is expected to present its hydrogen strategy in the coming weeks.
Emirates Global Aluminium (EGA), the largest non-oil and gas industrial company in the United Arab Emirates, and GE Gas Power have signed a memorandum of understanding to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the metal company's GE natural gas turbines by exploring hydrogen as a fuel, as well as carbon capture. “Using hydrogen as a fuel and adopting carbon capture, utilization and storage solutions could not only enable EGA to lower the carbon emissions from its electricity production, but also help to continue providing firm power on demand, supplying the reliable energy required to support their operations and growth, said Joseph Anis, president and chief executive of GE Gas Power Europe, Middle East, and Africa, on Sunday. “The initiative can serve as a model to emulate across various energy-intensive industries that require dependable, low carbon power generation capacity.”
Norwegian engineer Seanovent and thermoplastic composite pipe producer Strohm have signed a memorandum of understanding to work on offshore wind-to-hydrogen development. “The partnership will focus on developing safe and dependable hydrogen transfer solutions which enable and improve the distributed green hydrogen concept, whereby green hydrogen is generated in each wind turbine generator and transported to shore via a subsea pipe infrastructure,” the partner companies wrote yesterday. Caroline Justet, Strohm's business growth executive for ‘EiT,' said: “Seanovent's extensive offshore expertise, coupled with Strohm’s superior pipeline solutions, will enable the rapid acceleration of safe offshore wind-to-hydrogen projects by providing more reliable and cost effective solutions. This, in turn, will lower the levelized cost of energy and make distributed green hydrogen production offshore more competitive, sooner.”
China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec) has said a green hydrogen demonstration project started in Kuqa, in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region today. The facility was set to include a 300 MW solar plant; 20,000 metric tons of water electrolysis hydrogen production; 210,000 cubic meters of hydrogen storage; and a hydrogen transportation tube with a capacity of 28,000 cubic meters per hour. Total investment was around RMB3 billion (€416 million) and the project will finish by June 2023. Sinopec said the replacement of natural gas with solar for hydrogen production will save around 485,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.
Ten academics at Australia’s Monash University have said a breakthrough in green ammonia electrolysis could substantially lower the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the current, thermal Haber-Bosch process, which converts hydrogen and nitrogen to ammonia. “Zero-carbon-emission NH3 synthesis methods being explored include the promising electrochemical lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction reaction which has, nonetheless, required sacrificial sources of protons,” read an abstract of the group's research paper, published in Science. “In this study, a phosphonium salt is introduced as a proton shuttle to help resolve this limitation. The salt also provides additional ionic conductivity, enabling high NH3 production rates of 53 ± 1 nanomoles per second, per square centimeter at 69 ± 1% faradaic efficiency in 20-hour experiments under 0.5-bar hydrogen and 19.5-bar nitrogen. Continuous operation for more than three days is demonstrated.”

With heavily indebted developer Shunfeng set to have to pay backer Rainbow Fort Investments HK$175 million (US$22.4 million) by close of play today, the company has again delayed the release of details of the shareholder vote needed to approve the sale of seven solar projects with a total 283 MW of generation capacity, to raise RMB953 million (US$149 million). The company had originally promised the information by late October and that was then extended to today, with the company missing a deadline to settle RMB255 million (US$39.9 million) owed to investors in a 2016 corporate bond in the intervening period. Shunfeng yesterday promised to release details of the vote by December 31, which is the deadline for paying China Minsheng Banking Corp HK$300 million (US$38.5 million).

State-owned glassmaker Luoyang Glass wants to sell off three information display business units to focus its efforts on solar panel glass production. Independent shareholders in the business will vote on whether to sell the Longhai Glass, Longmen Glass and Bengbu CNBM Information Display subsidiaries for RMB536 million (US$83.9 million), to the Triumph Group business which is Luoyang’s controlling shareholder and which is owned by the China National Building Materials Group which owns both buyer and seller in the proposed deal. Luoyang said on Friday, the Longmen business has been idled since January 2 last year and owes its parent RMB540 million. With the proposed purchase price marking a RMB126 million (US$19.7 million) gain for the seller, the valuation of the Longmen business would reduce the total purchase price of the three units by RMB441 million (US$69 million). Details of the EGM needed to hold the vote were promised by December 23. Luoyang on Friday also revealed plans to invest RMB1.18 billion (US$185 million) in a PV cell packaging materials production facility comprising a furnace and solar substrate production line and five associated deep processing lines, with a total daily production capacity of 1,200 tons. As the production project, planned at Yaohua Hi-Tech Industrial Park in the Eastern district of the Qinhuangdao economic development zone would cost more than half Luoyang’s net assets, a vote will be required on the plans. The company said the project would have a 16-month construction period and would then need RMB30 million (US$4.7 million) of initial working capital.
Panel manufacturer JinkoSolar provided its n-type TOPCon solar modules for 18 rooftop projects energy company China Petrochemical & Chemical Corp has installed across its gas stations. Jinko said the green power generated will all be used by the fueling stations.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/30/the-outlook-for-residential-rooftop-solar-in-india/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"NOVEMBER 30, 2021",The outlook for residential rooftop solar in India,"From pv magazine India
Household rooftop solar in India is seeing a gradual improvement after almost stagnant annual growth of 100-200 MW until fiscal year 2020, according to a report from consultant Bridge To India.
The document cites subsidies paid under a Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) scheme as the main enabler for residential PV uptake.
The MNRE’s grid-connected rooftop solar program is aiming for residential installation of 4 GW by December next year. Now in its second phase, the scheme offers a 40% subsidy for the first 3 kW of generation capacity in rooftop systems and then a 20% subsidy up to a 10 kW ceiling. The program is being delivered at state level by electricity distribution companies.
Pick up the latest edition of pv magazine to read about the many software solutions driving the energy transition. From big data and artificial intelligence taking the hard work out of operations and monitoring, to the move toward international standards and a consensus in ensuring electricity networks are secured against cyber attacks and other digital threats; the bits and bytes of software solutions play a complex and central role in the energy system.
The Bridge to India report says the market outlook is also becoming positive due to a steady improvement in consumer awareness, affordability, financial viability, and financing options, as well as the entry of large organized solar installers.
“Free net metering in most states also strengthens [the] investment case for residential rooftop solar,” stated the report. “The average marginal tariff for a household with monthly consumption of 300 kWh in 15 states – accounting for 90% of [typical] residential consumption – is INR7.18/kWh ($0.096), effectively yielding an investment IRR [internal rate of return] of 8.3% for [a] 3 kW system.”
The study estimates the target market for domestic solar will hit around 52 million households by 2030 – 10% of urban independent households. Bridge to India forecasts residential PV generation capacity will reach 16.2 GW by 2030, under a medium scenario that assumes a 5% annual decline in system cost and a 3% annual fall in grid tariffs. That calculation took into account state-wise, bottom-up analysis of the market in view of prevailing grid tariffs, demographics, the number of independent houses, and the financial viability of residential solar.
The report estimates India had installed 1,292 MW of residential rooftop PV as of June. That accounted for only 17% of total rooftop solar capacity – which can also include commercial and industrial arrays – and just 2.9% of the nation's total solar capacity.
Only around 0.4% of independent urban homes – 400,000 – have installed rooftop solar. The major deterrents have been consumer inhibition and low awareness about the technical, financial, and operational aspects of installations, according to Bridge to India.
“Rooftop solar is not deemed as an essential purchase, because of improving … reliability of grid power,” stated the document. “A significant proportion of the urban, affluent population does not, also, have access to rooftop rights, or is unwilling to make a long-term cost commitment. Households attach a very high financial ([because of the potential] ability to expand the building vertically) and/or social value ([using the] space for leisure or games [and] utility needs) to rooftop [space], where available, restricting growth prospects.” 
A net capital cost – after the 40% upfront MNRE subsidy for sub-3 kW arrays – is currently estimated as INR32,000/kWp ($426), assuming a module cost of INR18.70/Wp ($0.249). That figure is within the affordability threshold of 67 million urban independent households, according to the consultant. However, added the report, cost increases, arising from more expensive panels; import duties including basic customs duty of 25% on cells and a 40% levy due from April; and a general sales tax set at 5-12%, could potentially dampen the rooftop market.
This copy was amended on 01/12/21 after Bridge to India changed its estimated net capital cost for MNRE-subsidized, sub-3 kW arrays from INR53,000/kWp ($706, at the exchange rate conversion made by pv magazine on 30/11/21) to INR32,000 ($426 by a conversion made on 01/12/21).

Germany deployed around 411.9 MW of new PV capacity in October, according to the latest figures from federal network agency the Bundesnetzagentur.
This compares to 406.4 MW in September this year, and 421 MW in October 2020.
In the first ten months of 2021, developers connected over 4.4 GW of solar to the grid, compared to 3.92 GW in the same period a year earlier. The country's cumulative solar capacity topped 56.9 GW at the end of October.
The German PV market keeps being driven by the segments for installations not exceeding 750 kW in size, which last month achieved a newly-installed PV capacity of 304 MW. Of this capacity, around 292 MW comes from rooftop PV arrays while the remaining share is represented by small-sized solar parks.
The Bundesnetzagentur also published new feed-in tariffs which will begin this month. The monthly decrease of solar subsidies remains at 1.4% while fixed feed-in tariffs for rooftop systems will range between €0.07693/kWh and €0.0527/kWh, depending on system size.

Green Akku, a German provider of solar modules for application on balconies, is offering a flexible solar module for use in boats, mobile homes and caravans.
The Sphere panel is available with wattages of 70, 110, 150 and 200 W. It has a thickness of just 2mm and can be bent up to 50 degrees, which makes it suitable for round or curved shapes in boat and vehicle construction. The panel is also built with translucent teflon ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) industrial coating that the manufacturer says ensures a very high level of scratch resistance and weather resistance.
According to the provider, monocrystalline five-busbar, 23%-efficient solar cells are used in the module, some of which are Sunpower-branded.
The weight of the modules is between 1.45 and 3.63 kilograms, depending on size, and they are suitable for a temperature range between -40 and 85 degrees Celsius.
The solar modules with conventional monocrystalline cells are designed for a maximum system voltage of 600 volts, while the modules with Sunpower cells are 45 volts, according to the data sheet. The dimensions of the modules vary between 745x540x2mm and 1,460x700x2mm.
Each module is designed to plug in with two, 90cm long MC4 solar cables (+/-), which can easily be laid through small openings and roof ducts, Green Akku explains. The modules are provided with a 25-year performance guarantee on 80% of the nominal output, and a five-year product guarantee.
Green Akku is currently offering the solar modules in Germany at a promotional price. The 70 watt module currently costs €150 instead of €177. The powerful, flexible solar modules with 200 watts of power with Sunpower solar cells cost €399 instead of €469. There is also a complete “mobilPV” photovoltaic system especially for campers, caravans and boats. It contains a 110 watt solar module, an MPPT solar charge controller with integrated Bluetooth function, mounting material and cabling. This package is available online for €335 instead of €380.

Shanxi province-based Guopu has told the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority it will invest $50 million in ground-mounted solar and wind projects if the government frees up 200 acres of land and water.
Rongxia Cheng, CEO of the developer, highlighted scarcity of land as a hurdle to clean power in the nation as part of the company's expression of interest in developing the generation capacity, which is under scrutiny by the development authority. “One of the main obstacles is to access suitable land at a reasonable price,” wrote Cheng.
The applicant performs consultation and planning, construction, and technology development for solar, wind and bio-based power plants and claims to have developed more than 2 GW of generation capacity; to own 430 MW of solar projects; and to have carried out engineering, procurement and construction contracts worth more than $350 million. “With every project, we reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, contributing to … environment[al] conservation and reducing dependency on fossil fuels; striving for a greener future,” added the CEO.
The more ambitious nationally determined contribution to the Paris Climate Agreement submitted by Bangladesh at this month's COP26 summit in Glasgow commits the nation to developing 4.1 GW of renewables capacity this decade and to source 40% of its power from renewables by mid century.
Having cancelled plans for ten new coal-fired power plants this year, Dhaka is hoping to attract foreign investment to fund its energy transition.
With scores of large scale solar plants under construction, the nation currently has 776.41 MW of renewables generation capacity, 425.88 MW of which is grid connected.

Around 73% of this demand will be covered by the solar array, and the remaining 27% by the linear generators.
The PV system was constructed by PowerFlex, a unit of France’s EDF Group, and the linear generators were provided by U.S. specialist Mainspring Energy. “The on-site solar project in Colton demonstrates Lineage’s ongoing commitment to deploying innovative solutions to ensure that its operations are as sustainable as humanly possible,” said PowerFlex director Danny Ptak.
Permanent-magnet linear generators use linear motion to generate power, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. They rely on permanent magnets that create a magnetic field and cause a magnetic flux change in a circuit formed by windings, to generate power.
“The units ramp up and down usage to enable maximum use of the building’s solar array, ensuring reliability and optimal use of renewable power at all times,” said Lineage, referring to the linear generators deployed at its facility. “This increases the site’s resiliency by reducing grid dependency, and lowers operating costs.”

Mainspring Energy's liner generator is claimed to provide fuel-flexible and dispatchable on-site power generation for behind-the-meter (BTM) commercial and industrial (C&I) customers; front-of-the-meter (FTM) utility substations; and micro-grids. It uses a low-temperature reaction of air and fuel to drive magnets through copper coils to produce power.
Natural gas or biogas can be used as fuels and, according to the manufacturer, the system can meet the strictest emissions standards in
the U.S., allowing for fast, streamlined permitting. “The design leads to high efficiency and low emissions with the added ability to dynamically
switch between renewable fuels such as biogas and hydrogen or non-renewable fuels such as natural gas and propane,” the company explains in a white paper dedicated to its technology. “Full dispatchability, or the ability to turn on [and] off and ramp up and down on command, allows linear generators to serve fluctuating energy demand profiles.”
Image: Mainspring Energy
The company also emphasizes that the electrically–controlled linear motion of oscillators embedded in the system compresses the fuel and air mixture until the mixture reacts uniformly and instantaneously without a flame or burning. “Since there is no flame or burning, the reaction occurs at low temperatures (less than 1,500 degrees Celsius) and, as a result, produces near–zero nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions.”
This reaction drives the two oscillators carrying magnets through copper coils and produces electricity through the linear motion. Outer springs are then compressed to return the oscillators for the next cycle.
Mainspring Energy offers the solution in 240 kW packages containing two linear generator cores and claims the generator can be linked either to on-site solar PV or battery storage to firm intermittency and add resiliency.

According to the company, the users of the shelf labels will be able to change prices centrally and synchronously across all retail stores within a chain. The devices are available in different colors and shapes and with a size ranging from 1.54in to 12.5in.
“Along with the price, they can display text and graphics, thus serving as an effective platform for conveying additional messages: Advertisements, special discount announcements, loyalty campaigns, and many more,” Saule Technologies stated, noting that the price can be changed up to 15 times a day. The lifetime of the device is estimated at 10 years.
The system is powered by a flexible perovskite solar cell manufactured through the company's room-temperature inkjet printing process.
Saule Technologies has been working on an inkjet printing process for the production of flexible perovskite solar modules since 2014. With this technology, the shape, color and size of the modules could be adapted to the needs of customers. These modules could also be installed at any free space on a building. They are also stable and water-resistant, the company claims.
The Polish manufacturer opened its cell factory in Wrocław, in western Poland, in June.

The big battery will initially start out with a one-hour duration (250 MWh) but will be capable of expanding to up to four-hour duration in the future (1000 MWh).
While its size pales in comparison to recent big battery announcements, the project has drawn attention for its deployment of grid-forming technology and is expected to reveal much about the promising new technology’s capabilities.
AGL expects the battery to be fully operational by early 2023, initially operating in grid-following mode before switching over to become grid-forming once Australia has finalized the new technology’s regulatory landscape.
The Torrens Island big battery will be the first in AGL’s national roll-out of 850 MW of grid-scale batteries. Rather poetically, the renewable project will be built at the site of AGL’s Torrens Island gas plant, just north of Adelaide in South Australia, and marks the first step in transitioning the fossil fuel site into the clean Torrens Island Energy Hub.

Grid-forming vs. grid-following
The Torrens Island battery will use over 100 inverters with grid-forming capabilities supplied from German-headquartered company SMA. SMA Australia’s Director of Large-Scale & Project Solutions Josh Birmingham told pv magazine Australia in August that trialling the technology at this scale “hasn’t been done before anywhere in the world.”
Traditionally inverters operate in what’s called grid-following mode, meaning their output synchronizes to the grid’s voltage waveform. ‘Grid-forming’ inverters, however, set their own frequencies, making them capable of providing the grid with ‘virtual inertia.’

Also known as virtual synchronous generation, grid-forming technology was flagged by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) just last week as a top priority because of the crucial role the technology is expected to play in the clean energy transition. System strength services and inertia has historically only ever been provided by baseload coal and gas power plants with their reliable outputs, but grid-forming technologies could answer the increasingly desperate need for a clean substitute as the penetration of variable, renewable energy increases.
The various levels of grid-forming tech
There are various levels of what grid-forming technology is capable of, Birmingham said. On the most basic level, if the main grid were to go down, a grid-forming system could continue supplying power to its local network. Unlike grid-following systems, it is able to form an islanded grid because it can generate its own frequency reference.
On a higher level, it can function as a “virtual synchronous machine,” meaning it can mimic the inertia services traditionally provided by spinning mass synchronous condensers, “pushing back” in the event of voltage fluctuations in the grid.
The ultimate level though is what’s known as ‘black start’ services. That means in the case of a system black event, the plant would be able to not only restart itself but potentially reenergize an area of the grid by rebooting other assets. This is seen as the pinnacle of what could potentially be offered by grid-forming technology and would mark a significant technological advancement.
Getting to the bottom of what, in reality, is plausible will be something projects like the Torrens Island will demonstrate.

AGL recently announced that its 50 MW battery in Broken Hill had achieved development consent and plans to construct a 200 MW battery at its Loy Yang A power station, a 150 MW battery at its Liddell power station as well as support grid-scale battery projects including Wandoan, Maoneng and Dalrymple.
Following AGL’s proposed demerger in 2022, the Torrens Island battery will be an asset of AGL Australia.

US-based mounting system provider S-5! launched a new product under its line of hardware specifically designed for seam metal roofs: PVKonceal.
PVKonceal is a module skirt that conceals the front face of the solar PV array, protecting mechanical and electrical components underneath, as well as creating an aesthetically sleek finish.
The skirt is made of corrosion-resistant aluminum with a prefinished black polyvinylidene fluoride finish, which is the same style of paint finish used to coat the metal roofs PVKonceal is intended for. S-5! said the hardware is rated to last the life of the solar array and the metal roof.
The solution can be used in two orientations and can cover module frames from 30-46 mm thick.
PVKonceal is intended for use with S-5!’s PVKIT product line, a mounting line developed for standing seam metal roofing. PVKIT 2.0 utilizes clamps designed to grab and attach onto metal roofs, both at the edge and across the surface. The kit’s pre-assembled components enable installers to attach PV modules to the metal roof’s structural seams or ribs vs. a traditional rail mounting system.
While not physically penetrating the roof, PVKIT is designed for resilience in high-wind applications. Project developers of two rooftop case studies featured in pv magazine USA said they both chose the system for its resistance to wind.
One of the case-study installations also features an S-5! snow-guard system, as metal roofs are typically installed in the northern U.S. for their ability to shed snow.
