Construction on the storage facility is planned to begin this year, with project completion scheduled for the autumn of 2022.
Called Giga Buffalo, the project has an annual storage capacity of around 30,000 MWh and will be used by Eneco to forecast supply-demand errors on the intraday trading market. The project will be located close to the Wageningen University & Research and will be connected to the local Windnet smart grid.
Eneco and Giga Storage last year deployed the 12 MW Giga Rhino battery relying on technology provided by NEC Energy Solutions at the site.
“For Eneco, being able to balance the supply and demand of energy, the intraday positions, is vital in order to be able to realize the further integration of sustainable means of production,” said Lucien Wiegers, Eneco Energy Trade's commercial director. “Storage of energy in batteries that are available 24/7 will play an important role in this, so we are delighted with the development of GIGA Buffalo, which at the same time also enables us to make significant CO2 savings.”

The latter is common thermal storage technology based on standard cooling equipment and an energy storage tank that is able to store cooling while shifting energy usage to off-peak, nighttime hours.
“The novelty of this work is that a solar cooling system directly driven by distributed PV is proposed and the rechargeable storage battery is replaced completely by low-cost ice,” research-co author Guoliang Li told pv magazine. “Solar air conditioners with different sizes of PV panels, with and without MPPT controller and different types compressors were built and tested outdoors to experimentally investigate the running characteristics of air conditioning at various solar irradiations.”
PV-driven air conditioners, according to the research group, are often equipped with batteries for energy storage and this results in challenges of low performance, high initial investment, and complex configurations for practical applications. “The ice thermal storage for the PV driven air conditioner with reduced batteries was explored in our previous work,” it explained. “It proved the feasibility of the ice thermal storage, where the batteries were only used as a buffer and the system average energy efficiency could reach 7.65%.”
The proposed new system consists of: A PV system built with 12-16 monocrystalline modules with a power output of 190 W mounted with a tilted angle of 30 degrees; a control system based on an inverter and an MPPT controller; an ice-making system comprising a variable-speed compressor with a frequency range of 360 Hz; a condenser; a liquid storage device; a capillary; an evaporator; an ice thermal storage tank; a gas-liquid separator; a variable speed pump; and a heat exchanger.
The performance of the system was evaluated considering operating efficiency and stability. “The optimal matching relationships were found and experimental results of the system with variable speed compressor and an MPPT controller have shown very good ice-making capability and reliable operation as well as a great improvement in the available photovoltaic power,” Li stated, noting that the average PV-to-compressor power efficiency (PPE) and coefficient of performance (COP) of the systems were improved by reducing the power ratio, which in turn reduced the operation stability ratio (OSR) of the compressor.
Through their analysis, the academics found that the use of an MPPT controller improved the PPE of the system by 81.7% compared to that of the system without MPPT, and that the variable-speed compressor was more adaptive for the PV-driven cooling.
The proposed system is presented in the paper “Study on matching characteristics of photovoltaic disturbance and refrigeration compressor in solar photovoltaic direct-drive air conditioning system,” published in Renewable Energy. The research group includes scientists from the Yunnan Normal University and the Jiaxing University.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/24/first-reactions-to-bidens-us-ban-on-solar-imports-from-chinas-xinjiang-province/,"HIGHLIGHTS,LEGAL,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JUNE 24, 2021",First reactions to Biden’s US ban on solar imports from China’s Xinjiang province,"From pv magazine USA
The decision to ban products from four Chinese solar manufacturers based in the Xinjiang province taken today by the U.S. Biden Administration has already provoked reaction from both analysts and market players.
John Smirnow, general counsel and vice president of market strategy at the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), issued a statement that said, “The news of enforcement action on solar products coming from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) is not unexpected and we fully support the Biden Administration’s efforts to address any forced labor in the solar supply chain.
“SEIA will continue to work with the administration and our partners to stand against forced labor and build a clean energy future we can all be proud of.”
Philip Shen of Roth Capital Partners said in a note to clients that the move could have a “significant negative impact on the whole U.S. solar industry.” He said that Hoshine is an annual supplier of around 800,000 MT of metallurgical-grade silicon, a raw material needed for polysilicon production.
Shen said that PV module imports may now need to prove that there is no content from Hoshine in order to enter the U.S. “Access to solar modules in the U.S., in our view, could be severely limited by this order as we believe isolating and tracing MG-Si through the supply chain could present a significant challenge.”
Adding to pressure on the Biden administration, members of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee sent a letter urging customs officials to “immediately take aggressive enforcement actions” regarding polysilicon products entering the United States from Xinjiang, China. The letter to acting U.S. Customs and Border Protection commissioner Troy Miller was dated June 10 and was signed by two dozen members of the congressional tax writing committee.
Reuters reported that Hoshine Silicon Industry said on an investor platform that it backed the Chinese foreign ministry’s reaction, adding that the firm does not export industrial silicon to the United States directly and that the impact on its business would be limited.
Xinjiang Daqo New Energy Co. sent the news agency an email saying the company has “zero tolerance” towards forced labor, and that it does not sell directly to U.S. companies, or buy from the United States, and there would not be “a significant impact on the company’s business.”
Last September under the Trump administration, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued five Withhold Release Orders (WRO) on products from the Xinjiang region. Products included hair products, apparel, cotton, and some computer parts.
Th Biden administration may have had no choice but to act on the ongoing allegations of forced labor in the solar supply chain, said Mark D. Herlach, a partner in the Washington, D.C. law firm Eversheds Sutherland. “No one wants to be in a position of not responding to forced labor,” he told pv magazine in an interview.
In a note to clients, the firm said that possible sanctions could have implications on purchasers of PV modules. These could include direct legal jeopardy, financing challenges, supply chain disruptions, and reputational risk. The note said that reputational concerns, for example, have led major brands such as Calvin Klein, Gap, H&M, IKEA, Patagonia, and Tommy Hilfiger to stop buying cotton sourced from Xinjiang.
*The article was amended to reflect that Hoshine is an annual supplier of around 800,000 MT of metallurgical-grade silicon and not magnesium silicide as we previously reported.

U.S.-based wafer manufacturer 1366 Technologies has confirmed plans for a 2 GW wafer and cell production facility in India. The unit is being planned under the Indian government’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, which aims to drive deployment of every stage of the solar supply chain, from polysilicon to module manufacturing.
A spokesperson for the company told pv magazine it is exploring manufacturing opportunities for its ‘direct wafer' production process in India and the business said it is also seeking solar module partners.
“The Indian government has made domestic solar manufacturing a priority and our technology is particularly well suited for the Indian market,” said the 1366 spokesperson. “Direct wafer manufacturing can immediately deliver the lowest cost of electricity in a single-junction device for India’s utility market, and it underpins an economically feasible, high-efficiency, tandem product for global leadership.”
The direct wafer process is a kerfless wafer technique, meaning it does not require silicon ingots to be sawn into wafers, a time-consuming process that wastes material as silicon dust. Instead, 1366’s technology forms wafers directly, using molten silicon. The company claims its direct wafer process offers the world’s lowest wafer production cost, translating into cell and module competitiveness.
The direct wafer approach has long held big hopes for the industry and the company operates a demonstration facility in Bedford, Massachusetts, where most of its technological developments were achieved. One such was a 20.3% cell efficiency level recorded in August 2017 in a Q Cells Q.antum cell which incorporated passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) technology and 1366 wafers. That record, 1366 Tech said at the time, was achieved on a pilot line using standard processes seen in mass production.
This copy was amended on 24/06/21 to reflect 1366 Technologies is planning a wafer and cell facility, rather than just wafers, and that it is seeking solar module, rather than cell partners.

Solar electricity tariffs of $0.0157, $0.0135 and $0.0104 per kilowatt-hour agreed in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, respectively, in the last 18 months, would enable renewables-powered hydrogen to be produced for as little as $1.62 per kilogram, according to IRENA's Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2020 report.
The Abu Dhabi-based international body made its calculations – all of which are in U.S. dollars – based on the $0.0104 solar power tariff agreed in Saudi Arabia in April, with green hydrogen generation being modeled at the Dumat al Jandal site in the kingdom which boasts strong solar and wind power resources. With the site already hosting a wind farm, IRENA modeled a hydrogen plant which would also harness solar and be connected to the grid. The report suggested lack of a grid connection would raise the renewable hydrogen cost to $1.74/kg, which still compares favorably to the current $1.45-2.40/kg price of hydrogen production powered by natural gas and equipped with carbon capture and storage (CCS) tech.
The latest edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big look at the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movements amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
Further extrapolating the costs, the study estimated a fall in hydrogen electrolyzer costs, from $750 per kilowatt of capacity to $350, would enable renewable hydrogen production for $1.16/kg. Raising electrolyzer efficiency to 72.5% and extending stack lifetime from 15 to 17.5 on top of that, IRENA said, could take green hydrogen below the prized $1/kg point.
With this year's renewables price report explaining how the three tariffs secured in the Middle East since January 2020 can be regarded as viable without any hidden caveats or subsidy, the authors of the study stated: “low-cost renewable hydrogen may already be in reach.”
The document fleshed out how up to 800 GW of coal-fired power generation capacity worldwide could already be replaced by newly-built renewable energy facilities as solar and wind prices have dipped under the cost of running legacy fossil fuel plants in many markets. That estimate included a $5/MWh cost of integrating renewables into the electric grid and IRENA said, with around 40% of that overpriced capacity – and 37% of actual generation – based in Bulgaria, Germany, India and the United States, decommissioning could save around $32 billion per year in energy costs. Making the switch would also eliminate three gigatons of carbon emissions – 20% of what IRENA estimates is needed to keep global heating to a maximum 1.5 degrees Celsius this century.
The latest edition of the report is based on data from around 20,000 renewables generation facilities worldwide which account for 1.9 TW of generation capacity, and on clean energy auction prices and power purchase agreements which add up to 582 GW of capacity. All the figures in the study exclude any form of subsidy and the authors point out, adding CCS to the world's overpriced coal plants would merely drive up their costs further.
IRENA has estimated all of Bulgaria and Germany‘s coal plants will this year cost electricity bill payers more than new renewables facilities would, based on a European carbon emissions price of €50 per ton. Even without an emissions trading scheme in the U.S. and India, the picture is similar, with 77-91% of American coal plants and 87-91% of Indian facilities also overpriced.
That conclusion is based on an estimated levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for solar power in India this year of $0.033/kWh, down from $0.038 last year; and of $0.031 in the States this year, although the report's authors note the solar module price has picked up between 1% and 9% in the first quarter of this year, thanks to shortages of raw materials such as polysilicon.
With the global LCOE of solar having fallen 7% from 2019 to last year, from $0.061 to $0.057/kWh, India led the world for low-price PV last year, with an average LCOE of $0.038/kWh for utility scale generation, ahead of China, with $0.044, and Spain, with $0.046. The authors noted Turkey also rapidly reduced average solar tariffs, to $0.052 last year, and Australia posted an average $0.057.
That translated into average solar project development costs of $596 per kilowatt installed in India, the world's lowest figure and down 8% from Indian costs in 2019. Solar projects in Vietnam came in to $949/kW and were only $796/kW in Spain last year, the report added. At the other end of the scale, projects in Russia cost $1,889/kW and, in Japan, $1,832, with those two countries exceptional among the 19 markets studied as the cost differences between areas from Canada (at $1,275/kW) down to India, were more evenly distributed.
Auction results posted last year, for projects expected to be commissioned this year and next, prompted IRENA to estimate the global average solar power price will fall to $0.039/kWh this year before rising slightly to $0.04 next year, which would still be a 30% fall on this year's figure and 27% less than the LCOE to be expected from new-build coal plants. With the predictions based on 18.8 GW of renewables capacity expected this year and 26.7 GW due in 2022, the study estimated 74% of the clean energy facilities expected this year and next will be cheaper than new fossil fuel generation sites.
Renewables are already making real headway, of course, with IRENA calculating 45.5 GW of the solar added last year was among the 62% of the 162 GW of clean energy facilities which were installed more cheaply than new-build coal plants.
Digging into the solar statistics, the report said mainstream solar panel costs in December ranged from $0.19 to $0.40 per Watt, for an average price of $0.27, with thin-film products averaging $0.28/W.
Operations and maintenance costs came in at an average of $17.80/kW last year in OECD countries and $9 elsewhere, in a year which also saw non-panel, balance-of-system equipment costs account for 65% of total project expense.
For residential solar arrays, average system prices in the 19 markets studied by IRENA ranged from $658/kW in India to $4,236 in California, for LCOE figures from $0.055/kWh in India to $0.236 in the U.K. For commercial systems, India was again the cheapest place to invest last year, at an average $651/kW, but a business in California would have to find $2,974/kW. Those system costs translated into LCOE numbers ranging between $0.055 in India and $0.19 in Massachusetts.
