Denmark’s largest power provider and wind project developer, Ørsted, has completed its Permian Energy Center project, a 460 MW hybrid solar and battery storage facility located in Andrews County, Texas.
Permian Energy Center brings Ørsted’s onshore operating capacity to 2.1 GW. The project and its 420 MW of solar PV and 40 MW of battery storage are on a 3,600-acre site alongside existing oil and gas installations and will supply growing West Texas demand for electricity.
Ørsted said it is one of the first developers to own the full spectrum of new renewable energy technologies at utility scale in the U.S., onshore and offshore wind, solar PV, and storage. More technical or financial details on the project were not disclosed.
Solar is on track to make up the largest share of new capacity additions in Texas between 2020 and 2022. Almost 50% of the additions during this time period will be solar, surpassing wind (35%) and natural gas (13%) additions, according to the Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration.
Factors driving solar investment in Texas include lower solar technology costs and plentiful sunlight, particularly in West Texas’s Permian Basin, where about 30% of the state’s planned solar capacity will be built.

Shareholders of Luoyang, which is ultimately controlled by China National Building Materials Group, will vote on whether to approve the RMB182 million acquisition of a 60% stake in glass maker North Glass from the Triumph Group which is Luoyang’s controlling shareholder.
TBEA-owned polysilicon maker and renewables developer Xinte Energy hopes to raise up to RMB2 billion (US$309 million) towards the cost of a poly fab it intends to start constructing before July and which could double its annual poly production capacity. Independent shareholders will vote on whether to approve the issuance of up to 177 million shares – almost 13% of the enlarged company’s stock – with electrical equipment company parent TBEA to sign up for 167 million and trading and leasing business Jinglong technology the balance. Xinte expects the new, 100,000-ton-capacity poly fab to take 18 months to build and will devote any excess proceeds from the fundraising exercise to solar project development by its TBEA Xinjiang New Energy business and wind projects instituted by Mongolia Xinte.
TBEA Xinjiang New Energy, meanwhile, has announced the settlement of a dispute over a 99 MW wind farm that has rumbled since last May, when Huaxia Financial Leasing sued it for RMB600 million (US$92.7 million) over delays to the facility. TBEA Xinjiang blamed developer Xuyi High Drive Wind Power and, in June sued it for its own costs of RMB130 million plus any costs incurred by the Huaxia suit. In December, TBEA Xinjiang bought Huaxia’s creditors’ rights in the suit for RMB600 million and, on Thursday, the Xinte Energy company stated it has settled the case after Xuyi High Drive agreed to pay it almost RMB899 million (US$139 million).

The Danish government has proposed a contracts-for-difference incentive system which will see applicants competitively bid to secure the lowest guaranteed strike price for the electricity they generate. Renewables plants will receive the wholesale electricity price for the power they produce and when that figure is below the strike price agreed through the auction tender, the government will pay the difference. When the money received from the wholesale market for the clean electricity is higher than the strike price, the generator will hand the difference back to the government.
The commission today said it had approved the new scheme, which will run until 2024, under its state aid rules.
The contracts-for-difference scheme, which replaces a former renewables incentives program that expired at the end of 2019, can offer contracted strike price payments for up to 20 years, the commission said today in a press release.
Margrethe Vestager, the commission's executive VP in charge of competition policy, said: “This Danish scheme will contribute to substantial reductions in greenhouse emissions, supporting the objectives of the [EU's] Green Deal. It will provide important support to a wide range of technologies generating renewable electricity, in line with EU rules. The wide eligibility criteria and the selection of the beneficiaries through a competitive bidding process, will ensure the best value for taxpayers' money and will minimize possible distortions of competition.”

Energy giant Shell and Norway-based research organization Sintef have announced the current status of the Refhyne project, at Shell's Rhineland Refinery, in Germany, will allow for the official opening ceremony to take place on July 2. The installation of the roof structure is one of the final stages of what the partners define as “Europe’s largest PEM electrolyzer.” The project is financially supported by the Fuel Cell Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCHJU). “Refhyne will produce … up to 1,300 tons of hydrogen per year. The technology is considered a pilot for use, for example, in mobility, industrial applications, electricity storage and heating,” read a note released by Shell on April 30. Sintef said, in a separate note, that the new electrolyzer, whose modules have been produced by ITM Power, will have a peak capacity of 10 MW.
The Germany-based Fraunhofer Institute for Chemical Technology has announced it is progressing with its research to reduce the cost of PEM water electrolysis. “Our group at Fraunhofer ICT was able to identify a suitable support material based on SiC. The oxygen evolution activity of an iridium-oxide based catalyst could be increased substantially using this SiC-based support, especially at high temperatures,” read a note released by the research center, which is also working on the optimization of porous transport layers.
U.K.-based electrolyzer maker ITM Power has established ITM Motive as a separate entity, which now owns and operates a portfolio of 12 hydrogen refueling stations (HRS'), eight of which are currently commissioned, with a further four under construction or funded. According to ITM Power, the wholly owned subsidiary is the largest operator of HRS' in the U.K. “We look forward to creating new partnerships and developing new investment models as we take our portfolio of hydrogen refueling stations to the next level to meet demand from the exciting range of new hydrogen vehicles that are set to enter the U.K. market over the next year,” read a note released on Tuesday. Last year, the Italian gas TSO, Snam, invested €33 million in ITM.
Oslo-based Nel Hydrogen Electrolyser, a division of Nel ASA, announced on Monday that it has received a purchase order for a 2 MW, fully containerized MC400 electrolyzer from Switzerland-focused H2 Energy. The Norwegian company said that the deal shows that hydrogen for heavy-duty vehicles is a reality. “The 2 MW PEM electrolyzer is the second system to be delivered as part of the green hydrogen infrastructure network that is currently supplying hydrogen to the first 46 Hyundai trucks already operating in Switzerland, and aiming to reach a fleet of 1,600 by 2025. The system will be filling 350 … trailers directly [on] site to dispatch the hydrogen to the Hydrospider network in Switzerland.”
Spain’s Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (MITECO), and the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism (MINCOTUR) have approved a joint resolution that determines the criteria for the first pre-selection of renewable hydrogen projects that will be part of the European project aimed at supporting the renewable hydrogen value chain, under the mechanism, ‘important projects of common European interest' (IPCEI). The process, which started in June 2020, will arrive to a first conclusion on May 7, the deadline for promoters to file the required information. Last week, 12 companies joined forces to set up the Hamburg Hydrogen Network, the most important hydrogen IPCEI so far. The joint projects should be commissioned by 2026.

The LeBlock solution consists of two kinds of five-foot, interchangeable battery blocks that the manufacturer describes as easy to transport via boat or truck and to be installed on a slab or pad with the support of a crane. Both solutions, the company went on to say, allow for shipping “as a standard 20-foot ISO container and serve as the heavy-duty enclosure for the installed system.”
The blocks are pre-assembled and the batteries are already embedded when the product is shipped, with wiring and connectors also being pre-installed.
One of the two systems is called BatteryBlock and is presented as a pre-installed, liquid-cooled battery that racks up to a storage capacity of 745 kWh and is equipped with a fire protection system. The second solution, dubbed CombiBlock, consists of a series of battery blocks containing a centralized liquid cooling unit.
“LeBlock is designed to assist utility and [help] energy project managers seeking a less complex, [and more] reliable and cost-effective solution to replace or increase the reliability of the grid while helping to reduce carbon footprint and the impact of power generation on the environment,” said the company's CEO, Anil Srivastava.
The manufacturer said that both solutions feature a fire-resistant construction, an emergency stop function, a fire detection and suppression system, isolation monitoring, and a ‘deflagration panel' for relief of any internal pressure. “The system complies with all common international standards for transport and battery integration, including UN38.3, UL9540A, IEC62933, NFPA 855, NFPA 68 and more,” it further explained.

The company is planning a 36 MW solar plant and a 7.5 MW battery storage facility at the Sukari mine, near the Red Sea, which is owned and operated by the Egyptian government and Australian miner Centamin plc.
Juwi said it expects to have the solar-plus-storage plant operational by July next year, when it will begin to reduce consumption at the off-grid mine's diesel power plant by around 22 million liters of the fuel per year.
The developer announced the facility in a press release today which stated the solar project would feature bifacial panels mounted on single-axis trackers. Cairo-based Giza Systems was named as construction partner on the project.
Amiram Roth-Deblon, director of global business initiatives at Juwi said: “Our proven track record with hybrid designs and project delivery in locations with some of the world’s best solar resources, enables our clients to drive down cash operating costs with maximized throughput and reliability. The collaboration with Centamin and its forward-looking expert advisors has been crucial for the closure of the project.”

The role of defects in perovskite material structures is currently one of the most studied areas here. Such defects are thought to be the main limiting factors in both performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. And while different types of passivation – where a coating is applied to limit the activity of defects – have been used successfully, the mechanisms by which these defects affect solar cell performance are not fully understood, and a closer look at them could open up even more effective strategies.
Taking such a closer look was the goal of a group of scientists led by China’s Peking University, who investigated a method using additives to control the perovskite’s dielectric properties, and demonstrate the creation of a screening effect that limits the influence of defects on solar cell performance. “Such an effect lowers the possibility that carriers are trapped in defects, thus, even if the defects still exist, they are, to some extent, “invisible” to charge carriers…,” the group explained. “Based on these improvements, nonradiative recombination pathways can be considerably suppressed.”
Working with an inverted perovskite solar cell device made from formamidinium-cesium lead halide, the group used this approach to fabricate a 22.3% efficient solar cell with 1.25 V open-circuit voltage, and also provide new insights into where voltage losses occur between the perovskite film and the PV device. The work is described in full in the paper Dielectric screening in perovskite photovoltaics, published in Nature Communications.
“The accelerated dielectric response of the film not only greatly improves the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite but also boosts the power conversion efficiency…” the group explained. “…further quantitative analysis in the voltage loss provides a clear understanding of the different origins of nonradiative losses and corresponding contributions.”
With these insights into how various particles interact with each other deep within a perovskite material, the group expects to unlock several new pathways for researchers to bring perovskite solar cells even closer to their theoretical efficiency limits. “This work provides a new paradigm to mitigate the adverse effect of defects from different angles,” they conclude, “which will open a new avenue to further minimize nonradiative recombination losses in perovskite photovoltaics by dielectric regulation.”

“It is interesting to note that, in this project pipeline, there are at least 8.4 GW of projects that have also secured a power purchase agreement (PPA),” the CEO of Greener, Marcio Takata, told pv magazine.
Five projects, with capacities ranging from 600 MW to 1 GW, account for around 3.6 GW of the capacity under signed PPA.
The report also reveals that the utility scale PV projects that are in an early or intermediate stage of development have a combined capacity of 98.9 GW, and that around 47% of the authorized projects have a size of over 100 MW.
Furthermore, Greener analysts said that bifacial modules are becoming the new standard for new projects, with a market share of around 54%. As for the inverters, they stressed that string devices should see their share increase from just 10% in 2020 to 38% this year.
The report also analyzes the development of the projects being planned, developed, or built under the country's auction scheme in the so-called “regulated market” and recalls that the two procurement exercises planned for 2020 were canceled due to the Covid-19 crisis. This year, however, the Brazilian authorities should hold four auctions, all of which are expected to include solar among the competing sources.
Projects contracted in the regulated market have so far reached a combined capacity of 4.6 GW and around 66% of them are already operational.
The report also provides data on module and inverter suppliers, as well as a model to structure PPAs in the Brazilian market.

The 325-acre solar project, to be built on a mainly government-owned khas (fallow) site leased from the Ministry of Land, will take shape with the help of at least 75% of Indian goods and services, under the terms of the sponsor nation's foreign credit rules.
Dhaka will directly provide $40 million for the project, with the state-owned Rural Power Company Ltd supplying a further $5.9 million. The solar farm, near the Jamuna river in Bangladesh's northeastern Jamalpur district, is expected to come online by December 2023 and the authorities are already planning a second 100 MW solar project nearby, with an unnamed Chinese company.
The solar park will provide power to the nearby Mymensingh and Dhaka districts, according to Rural Power Company MD Abdus Sabur.
The Bangladesh Planning Commission has directed a dam planned to surround the renewables project be planted with trees.
Rural Power Company's Sabur said he hoped development could start soon, provided the plan is approved by the executive committee of the National Economic Council, the highest decision making body in Bangladesh.
The Indian-financed solar park was originally planned for the Bagerhat district in the southwest of Bangladesh but was moved on ecological grounds because bodies of water on that site would have had to be landfilled to make way for the panels.
Dhaka is cranking up its renewable energy efforts after falling far short of its ambition to draw 10% of its electricity from renewables by last year. With around 730 MW of clean energy generation capacity, renewables made up around 3% of the energy mix in 2020.
The nation's latest five-year plan, which runs until 2025, features “aggressive efforts” to support renewables development and work is under way to update a decade-old national clean energy policy.

Bolivia has announced plans to resume lithium extraction, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Hydrocarbons and Energy and state-owned Yacimientos de Litio Bolivianos (YLB) last week.
The call is aimed at companies that have direct lithium-extraction technology (EDL) and that can conduct pilot tests at the Uyuni, Coipasa and Pastos Grandes salt flats, the Bolivian government said.
International players such as Russia's Uranium 1G, China's Gangfeng Lithium and TBEA, and U.S.-based EnergyX recently participated in an online meeting that YLB and the ministry held with potential investors. Experts at the meeting outlined the characteristics of EDL technology.
“EDL technology is a step toward innovation that will provide important opportunities to generate technical and technological growth and that is what we are here to present today,” said Minister of Hydrocarbons and Energy Franklin Molina.
This is the second attempt to exploit lithium in Bolivia. YLB and Germany's ACI Systems agreed in October 2019 to set up a joint venture to exploit lithium from Bolivia. Around $1.2 billion was to be invested in a high-tech complex at the Uyuni salt flat, with the main product to be lithium-ion batteries. Under the terms of their agreement, YLB was set to take a 51% stake in the joint venture. Just a month later, however, the government stopped the project by decree, without giving any explanation.
In April 2018, the Bolivian authorities said that ACI Systems had been chosen to commercialize Bolivian lithium from among the eight expressions of interest the government had received. The agreement would have had a duration of 70 years.
Salar de Uyuni is believed to be the world's largest lithium deposit. The original plan was to produce 30,000 to 40,000 tons of lithium hydroxide a year from 2022, with investments of €300 million to €400 million.

The company said it shipped 1.69 GWac of inverters in the first three months of this year for revenue of $406 million, up 13% from the $358 million generated from October to December and down 6% on the first quarter of 2020, which posted a figure of $431 million.
That added up to net income of $30.1 million in the first quarter, up 70% from the $17.7 million banked in the previous window but down 29%, year-on-year, from $42.2 million.
SolarEdge anticipates higher returns in the current quarter, with three-month trade to the end of June expected to generate revenue of $445-465 million. The revenue from the sale of solar products in the current quarter, which came in at $376 million in January-to-March, is expected to be around $405-420 million.

Now, they are finally moving forward with their first investments.
Systovi recently kicked off efforts to transform its existing production line with an investment of €1.5 million ($1.8 million). The orders for machines that have just been placed and the new equipment should be operational by the end of 2021.
“This development is a first step in the materialization of the Belenos project, which aims to achieve a combined panel production capacity of 1 GW per year,” said Francois Guerin, the CEO of Cetih, Systovi's parent company. “If the Belenos project will be successful, a second line with much more capacity will be installed at our Carquefou site.”
The manufacturer is also working on developing a 400 MW module for residential applications.
Meanwhile, Voltec Solar is now moving forward with its plans to invest around €2.5 million in its manufacturing facility in Dinsheim-sur-Bruche, Bas-Rhin.
“The modernization efforts carried out entirely with European equipment have a dual objective. They will increase our productivity and make our panels more efficient,” said Pierre Cantrelle, CEO of Voltec Solar.

To date, the EBRD has already provided over €2 billion for energy sector projects in the Western Balkans, mostly for renewables.
The London-based bank is well aware of local concerns which see, in large PV installations, a threat to agricultural land. It is working on alternative solutions. In North Macedonia, the EBRD is supporting the government for a 100 MW tender on disused mines.
“These will be two lots in the southwest of the country. Private investors will offer a share of revenues with the owners of the mines,” Francesco Corbo, regional head of energy for the Western Balkans and Croatia at the EBRD, told pv magazine. He added that each country in the region will be able to have PV systems, for at least 200-300 MW of total capacity on disused coal mines.
“Putting the panels on [disused] mines makes sense, also because public companies owning coal mines [might] invest in rehabilitating them. Instead, they can attract private investors to have solar panels and generate renewable electricity,” said Corbo. Another advantage is that these areas often have energy infrastructure. “Mines already have the needed [grid] connection points and related substations,” said Corbo.
Earlier this month, the EBRD signed a €9.1 million loan for a 12.9 MW floating solar photovoltaic farm at a reservoir-based hydropower plant in Albania for state utility KESH sh.p.
“We think that floating PV is a good option because it can solve climate change effects like increased evaporation and successfully address land scarcity for ground-mounted solar. Our project in Albania was the first medium-size, fully commercial floating PV [installation] in the region. The solar electricity will be sold during peak [periods] with the hydropower plant acting as a battery,” Corbo further explained. “This integration is important and we hope to replicate this model with other state-owned utilities in the region. We demonstrated that, despite [the] higher costs of the floating technology – compared to ground-mounted [facilities] – these projects have significant benefits and fit the needs of the region.”
The EBRD is also supporting Serbia with the first regional project for large scale solar-thermal district heating. “We are carrying out a feasibility study to demonstrate the competitiveness of renewable, solar-based generated heat plus large scale seasonal heat storage projects vis-a-vis heating from fossil fuels,” Corbo added. “It could cut costs and emissions at the same time.” Nonetheless, the time is not yet ripe for other storage solutions. “Storage will definitely come but at a later stage,” he said.
“Enhancing renewables penetration is, for us, the [means] to decarbonize the region’s energy sector,” Corbo stated. Coal has to be fully substituted by renewables by 2050. “That’s an imperative not only in view of the Paris Agreement, but also [because coal] is not, any more, economically competitive, especially if we account [for] the upcoming EU carbon border tax adjustment,” he also said.
According to a recent report published by the European Commission, coal generation in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina rose by 4% and 8%, respectively, in 2020. The EBRD is currently providing support for renewables auctions in Albania, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Kosovo.
“In Albania, the country we started [in] first (together with North Macedonia), we have been providing, so far, support for two rounds of solar auctions. The first one, for 140 MWp, was won by French investor Voltalia with a very low price (€24.89/MWh). A second auction, for 100 MWp, was won by the same French company last month, for €29.89/MWh. These are record prices for the region, but they should not be considered as references valid for the region,” said Corbo, explaining that the auction’s prices were due to solar radiation, as Albania has the best in the region, the characteristics of the local energy market, and the structure of the auctions.
“This auction was structured in a way that 50% of generation is contracted to the state-owned off-taker, while the rest will be sold in the unregulated market at a price expected to be at least double [that of] the auction price,” said Corbo.
According to the EBRD, good signals are also coming from the political process in the region. “When you’ve regulatory framework, you attract more investors, also for what concerns PPAs. Going forward, I would expect that the first 30-40% of capacity will come from a support scheme, like auctions, and eventually PPA's with state-owned utilities. The rest won’t be supported by the governments, as … is slowly happening in Spain and Italy,” he concluded.

Called GridScale, the stone storage system is described as a cheap and efficient alternative to lithium-based batteries and is claimed to enable the storage of renewable electricity for around a week.
In the proposed project, the electricity produced by a large scale renewable energy generator is used to power a system of compressors and turbines which in turn pumps heat energy from one or more storage tanks filled with cool stones to an equal number of storage tanks filled with hot stones.
When this process is activated, the cold stones see their temperature further drop and the hot stones, by contrast, become much hotter and reach temperatures close to 600 degrees Celsius. “The heat can be stored in the stones for many days and the number of sets of stone-filled tanks can be varied, depending on the length of storage time required,” the researchers specified.
When the stored energy is needed, the reverse process is applied, which makes the stones in the hot tanks become colder and those in the cold tanks become warmer, and the released thermal energy can be used for different applications.
“Basalt is a cheap and sustainable material that can store large amounts of energy in small spaces and that can withstand countless charges and discharges of the storage facility,” said Andel's scientist, Ole Alm.
When built, the system will be connected to a wind power plant and will become Denmark's largest storage facility. “It will definitely be in the eastern part of Denmark, in south or west Zealand or on Lolland-Falster, where production from new large PV units in particular is growing faster than consumption can keep up,” the consortium explained.
The DKK35 million (€4.7 million) project is being funded with DKK21 million (€2.8 million) from the Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program (EUDP). The group of participants includes the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), Welcon, BWSC Burmeister Wain Scandinavian Contractor, Energi Danmark, and Energy Cluster Denmark.
According to a document published by the California Energy Commission last year, Stiesdal had also proposed to build a large scale pilot project in the U.S., in partnership with Magellan Stortech. “A GridScale system coupled with a solar farm could be configured to charge for eight hours and discharge for 16 hours, in order to enhance the system value of the solar power,” the document read.
The system is described as a sort of giant heat pump, and one of the main challenges for its implementation is to identify a stone size that provides a good thermal gradient with a low-pressure drop.
The storage technology is also claimed to have no location requirement, low round-trip energy cost, high energy density, a small footprint, and round trip efficiency of 35-60%. Its developers believe it could be, potentially, scaled up to a capacity of up to 1 GW and a storage capacity of 100,000 MWh.
Basalt-based storage was identified in previous research as a suitable storage material for concentrated solar tower power plants.

A policy paper written by the Africa Clean Energy Technical Assistance Facility unit of the U.K. government's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, and by Open Capital Advisers, has called for the reimposition of exemptions from VAT and import duties on household solar products such as lighting systems.
The document, presented by Netherlands-based off-grid lighting group GOGLA and trade body the Kenya Renewable Energy Association (KREA), said the nation would miss the target, set in 2018, of providing electricity to 1.9 million households by next year, with 46% of the country's rural population currently reliant on paraffin and gas lamps, torches, batteries, firewood and candles for lighting.
Last year, the Kenyan government reimposed a 16% VAT rate on standalone solar products, and the East African Community – in which Kenya is a member, along with Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda – reinstated import duty on such products. In each case, though, solar panels and control units are still exempt from the duties, the policy paper noted.
While noting the VAT rate would generate around $9.6 million per year – and import duties $10 million – for the Kenyan government, GOGLA, which was formerly known as the Global Off-Grid Lighting Association, and the KREA said the tax benefits offered by wider access to such products would dwarf those immediate gains.
The policy paper, which claimed standalone solar system prices have risen 10-24% since the tax changes, and sales volumes fallen 25%, estimated the 250,000 households which could open new businesses, or whose residents could start new jobs with cheap access to home solar, could generate $46 million more in tax revenues for Nairobi, with a further $2.7 million per year in prospect from the creation of 2,500 more jobs in the industry.
The authorities should not only reinstate exemptions for standalone solar systems, said the paper, but should further incentivize products such as up-to-3 W and 3-11 W lighting systems, and encourage Kenyan manufacture of such devices.
Failing to take action, said the policy paper, could see 600,000 fewer households with access to solar by 2025.
The Africa Clean Energy Technical Assistance Facility is a four-year program set up by the British government to boost the private-sector standalone solar device market in Kenya.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/04/lithium-saturation-to-make-old-batteries-new/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,FINLAND,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"MAY 4, 2021",Lithium saturation to make old batteries new,"With energy storage technology playing an ever more important role in our daily lives, one that is set to increase dramatically with the adoption of electric vehicles, availability of the materials to manufacture lithium-ion batteries, their safe disposal and strategies for recycling are increasingly important concerns.
Though Europe and other regions are beginning to introduce laws requiring use of recycled materials in battery production, extracting these economically remains a major challenge for recyclers – separating and purifying the materials to the point where they can be reused requires multiple expensive and energy-intensive processes.
Scientists led by Finland’s Aalto University were initially studying the aging mechanisms of lithium cobalt oxide, commonly used in consumer electronics products, and made an observation that led them to investigate new methods to extend their lifetime or enable reuse of components without the complex process of stripping them down to raw materials. “We noticed that one of the main causes of battery deterioration is the depletion of lithium in the electrode material,” explained Aalto University professor Tanja Kallio. “The structures can nevertheless remain relatively stable, so we wanted to see if they can be reused.”
The group developed an electrolysis process to replenish the lithium in battery electrodes, and then compared the performance of electrodes treated in this way with those made from brand new materials. The results are published in the journal ChemSusChem, in a paper titled The reuse of LiCoO2 electrodes collected from spent Li‐ion batteries after the electrochemical re‐lithiation of the electrode.
The group found that the re-lithiation process served to restore the original electrode structure, and demonstrated capacity, rate capability, and cyclability properties only slightly behind the brand new batteries. The group further noted that comparable electrolysis processes are already used in various industries, and that their approach would also be worth investigating on an industrial scale.
“By reusing the structures of batteries we can avoid a lot of the labor that is common in recycling and potentially save energy at the same time,” says Kallio. “We believe that the method could help companies that are developing industrial recycling.”
For now, the group at Aalto University’s next goal will be to test and optimize its process for use with other battery chemistries, particularly the nickel-rich cathode designs that have moved to large-scale production in recent years, primarily as batteries for electric vehicles.

First Solar and Nel Hydrogen Electrolyser AS, a division of Nel ASA, have announced plans to develop integrated photovoltaic/hydrogen power plants.
The companies will initially collaborate to develop an integrated power plant control and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. The development of this network architecture is critical to enable the optimization of PV-electrolyzer hybrid projects, resulting in low total costs of hydrogen and electricity.
After that, the two companies will explore ways to optimize and integrate technology throughout the solar and hydrogen production plant.
In statements, the companies stressed their desire to deliver the lowest total cost of solar to hydrogen possible. Both also noted that First Solar’s low-carbon production of its cadmium-telluride modules was significant for keeping emissions low.
Because the partnership is so recent in nature, they have yet to reveal specific project timelines.

Mumbai architecture firm NUDES has designed Solar Mountain, which could become a permanent installation on Burning Man’s 3,800-acre ranch in Nevada and produce 300 MWh of electricity annually.
The design features an array of solar panels fanning out from a central spine. Construction is planned with modular design elements of recycled wood and other environmentally friendly materials. It would include four units, each with 182 solar panels of 300W capacity.
Burning Man is an annual festival focused on community, art, self-expression, and self-reliance. The NUDES design is one of 10 finalists in a design challenge by Land Art Generator Initiative and Burning Man Project known as LAGI 2020 Fly Ranch.
Later this year, selected design teams will be offered a grant to build a functional prototype on site.

A detailed new study by UNSW’s School of Photovoltaic & Renewable Energy Engineering (SPREE), on behalf of the Australian Conservation Foundation, shows that solar installed across the rooftops of major sports stadiums and sporting association head offices could generate around 20,000 megawatt-hours of clean energy per year.
“Sports in Australia face a growing threat from climate change,” said Australian Conservation Foundation Campaigns (ACF) Director Paul Sinclair.
He said that global warming, driven primarily by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas, “is drying out sports grounds, disrupting events and increasing health risks for players.” At the peak of the devastating 2019-20 fire season, Sydney FC midfielder Alexander Baumjohann likened playing soccer in Australia to “smoking 50 cigarettes a day.”
The ACF report is part of a trend to identify the benefits that can accumulate when whole industries or associations take up the challenge of decarbonizing. Last week, it was federally controlled airports; now, as the soccer and Australian Football League (AFL) seasons hit their stride, sport is coming under the sun’s influence.
Some of the biggest trophies in the race to be 100% powered by clean energy by 2030 are calculated to be the AFL’s Metricon Stadium, the Sydney Cricket Ground (with space for 1 MW of generation), and the Darwin headquarters of Football NT, which could soon kick off under lights powered by 406 kilowatts of solar PV. A feature in The Canberra Times last week also saw Weston Creek Tennis Club claiming an early victory and a “warm fuzzy feeling” from its installation of 25 solar panels on its clubhouse, given a AUD 12,000 ($9,290) federal government grant in 2020. The club followed best practice by initially improving its energy efficiency with the installation of LED lights to replace halogen globes in its light towers.
An additional high-level assessment of the solar potential of regional and community clubs across AFL, cricket and soccer alone came up with some 400 square meters of viable but as yet unused roof space on club facilities.
The report, published in three parts to really hone in on the three major sports, goes into satisfying detail. It lists the potential of individual club headquarters and provides images of the most solar-suitable club buildings, with aerial shots of panels superimposed on key sites offering direct inspiration.
ACF is also moving the goalposts to favor a big win. It has contracted the Australian Energy Foundation to provide 75 free energy coaching sessions to sports clubs, which will help them work out a business case for solar installation. Register interest here.
