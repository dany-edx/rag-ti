Solar panels are now an accepted means of producing clean electricity, and Australia is revving along the roadmap to mass production of clean hydrogen using a two-step solar conversion process — photovoltaics followed by electrolysis. But this month, Swinburne University of Technology’s Associate Professor Tianyi Ma received an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship of more than $937,000 to pursue his work using solar energy directly in photocatalysis, to repurpose abundant carbon dioxide emitted during industrial processes into “solar” fuels such as green methane, methanol and carbon monoxide.
The efficiencies of Ma’s technology are currently lower than photovoltaics which have been developed to achieve between 20% and 30% conversion of light into electricity. His work with new-generation carbon dioxide photoreduction catalysts — perovskite-based ferroelectrics — have so far achieved a solar-to-fuels efficiency of 2-5%, but that’s increasing.
Importantly, the materials used are much cheaper than those used in solar panels, offering substantial savings on upfront capital investment and the technology shows potential for co-location with industry, to siphon off CO2 at the source and produce fuels that can replace high-emitting fossil fuels.
Yes, even these solar fuels when burned will release carbon into the atmosphere, but they go some way to achieving a low-cost circular economy for carbon-capturing what’s emitted, and producing replacements for new fossil fuel production.
“My goal is carbon neutrality,” the lead of the Carbon Neutrality Group at Swinburne University of Technology tells pv magazine Australia. Boom-boom!

For some years Ma was known for his work using grid-supplied electricity in a process known as electrocatalysis, for reducing CO2 into potentially reusable fuels. “The thing is,” he says, “that the majority of electricity in the grid still isn’t green, so I recently changed focus to photocatalysis, because I want to use pure renewable energy.”
Ma says his work is still “inspired” by electrocatalysis, in that he’s using an external power source to accelerate a catalytic reaction. But there’s no voltage in raw sunlight, so “if we can create a little bit of an electric field in the semiconductor catalyst…”
Ma identified a novel ferroelectric, crystalline material that doesn’t have a symmetric structure, “So it has a little bit of polarisation in the structure”, which translates into “an intrinsic and spontaneous electric field” that delivers high-performance photocatalysis.
His Future Fellowship comes under the ARC Discovery Scheme, which aims to promote Australia’s strong capability in fundamental, or ‘blue sky’ research, and to generate new ideas, new jobs, economic growth and enhanced quality of life in Australia, according to the literature.
Ma’s group will use the funding over four years, initially, he says “to generate some high quality papers, scientific breakthroughs and even patent some of the technologies”.
Because Swinburne focuses heavily on translation of research to industry, Ma’s project team is also already collaborating with GrapheneX, a pioneer in the field of synthesising high-value carbon nanomaterials, from low-cost carbon sources; and with the Clayton Hydrogen Technology Cluster (Clayton H2), one of 15 nationwide renewable energy platforms supported by National Energy Resources Australia.
“We’re working with GrapheneX to treat carbon-dioxide emissions from the biomass lignite [aka brown coal]-mining industry,” says Ma, “and I can foresee that towards the middle of the four-year fellowship, we could partly commercialise some of those technologies.”

In his six-months-new role at Swinburne, which appointed him Associate Professor at the university’s Centre for Translational Atomaterials, Ma has also already published a paper describing a photocatalytic process to produce hydrogen from seawater, using a novel single-atom platinum catalyst, that yielded solar-to-hydrogen quantum  efficiency of 22.2% under LED-550 illumination.
This is “among the best catalysts ever reported” for the solar-to-hydrogen process, said Baohua Jia, Founding Director of the Centre for Translational Atomaterials in February when the paper was released.
Compared to carbon-dioxide splitting, photocatalytic water splitting is a piece of cake, asserts Ma, but he was compelled to pursue CO2 splitting to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and at the same time produce chemicals that are useful.
The splitting of carbon dioxide, he says, can take more than six potential pathways. It can, for example, be catalysed to form carbon monoxide, formic acid, ethanol or methanol, of which the latter three are important chemical feedstocks.

“We’ve also been doing this photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide in an aqueous, or water, solution,” explains Ma, which generates a competing reaction. That is, the water will also take part in the reaction and split out into hydrogen and oxygen.
“So you can never get pure carbon monoxide this way, you always have a monoxide with a little bit of hydrogen, which is what we call syngas — one of the most widely used fuels for residential cooking — there’s a huge market for it.”
Ultimately, his project, as described for Future Fellowship consideration, is expected to “deliver highly efficient photocatalysts and reaction prototypes for carbon dioxide reduction, to relieve the greenhouse effect and accelerate the development of large-scale carbon dioxide utilisation for clean fuels production by making use of abundant and clean solar energy”; the catalysts and techniques “are highly promising for commercialisation and industry-level application”.

The scientists shaped the catholyte by using two ligands: 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic (Dcbpy) acid, and cyanide. Cyanide was previously used in other research and was found to be able to improve the voltage and solubility of redox batteries compared to the commonly used ferrocyanide ligands.
The academics built the battery through what they called a symmetry-breaking strategy, which consists of changing the symmetry of the redox-active organic molecules, instead of using the common approach of attaching a hydrophilic functional group. Hydrophilic functional groups are membranes used to achieve fast ion transport combined with high molecular selectivity, and to provide aqueous organic flow batteries with energy efficiency and capacity retention.
The research group said its approach results in a considerable improvement of the molecules' solubility. The battery is claimed to have retained more than 90% of capacity over 6,000 cycles, which the scientists said projects “more than 16 years of uninterrupted service [at] a pace of one cycle per day.” The capacity fading rate was 0.00158% per cycle, or 0.217% per day.
The scientists are currently planning to design new materials for this battery technology and have already submitted a patent application to the relevant U.S. authorities. “To significantly improve the performance of aqueous organic RFBs, the urgency of developing new catholyte[s] is crucial,” said researcher Yu Zhu.
The device was described in the paper Symmetry-breaking design of an organic iron complex catholyte for a long cyclability aqueous organic redox flow battery, published in nature energy.

The SNP won 64 seats in May's Scottish Parliament elections, leaving it one seat short of a majority and, having initially announced an intent to rule with a minority government, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on Friday announced the deal with the Greens, whose deputies hold eight seats in the chamber.
Pick up your copy of pv magazine today for an in-depth look at batteries big and small; how they’re changing and how they are changing the world. What do batteries have in store for us? The August edition of pv magazine has answers to the big questions surrounding the battery energy storage revolution.
The arrangement stops short of a full coalition, with the Greens having agreed to support their partners on votes of confidence and supply – those of existential importance to the government in question.
The arrangement led to the publication of a draft shared policy program issued by the two parties on Friday, and national PV trade body Solar Energy Scotland welcomed the mention of photovoltaics in the document.
Chairperson Thomas McMillan said: “The solar energy industry in Scotland welcomes the clear recognition in the cooperation agreement of the important role solar can play in Scotland’s drive to meet our 2030 climate obligations. As the cheapest, most readily deployable renewable technology – with substantial benefits for the economy and helping to tackle fuel poverty – it is time for the sector to be allowed to grow and flourish. Scotland’s solar opportunities could see deployment increase 15-fold by 2030, and this would deliver a solar sector in Scotland proportional to what is being achieved elsewhere in the U.K.”
The inclusion of PV in the policy document falls well short, however, of Solar Energy Scotland's call for 4-6 GW of photovoltaics to be installed in the nation this decade.
While the paper outlines an ambition for 8-10 GW of onshore wind farms by 2030 – albeit “subject to consultation” – on top of the existing goal of 11 GW of offshore facilities, solar is mentioned only as having “an important role in continuing to decarbonize our heat and electricity supply.” A section of the policy document devoted to the national planning system out to 2050 merely states an aim to “enable renewable energy, including solar power.”

According to the document, 39 wind projects and 63 solar projects will compete in the tender, through which the South African authorities hope to allocate 2.6 GW of renewable energy capacity.
“The fact that over 100 projects were submitted for 1 GW of solar PV, and 1.6 GW of wind, shows developers are still very interested in South Africa's renewable energy market, despite delays during previous rounds,” Chris Ahlfeldt, energy specialist at Blue Horizon Energy Consulting Services, told pv magazine.
He also explained that, while 62% of the projects proposed would use solar PV technology, Eskom's transmission constraints for new generation capacity in the Northern Cape province suggest that successful solar PV bids will likely need to target locations in one of the other eight provinces in the country, unlike in previous REIPPPP rounds, where most of the solar PV capacity was in the Northern Cape as it has some of the best solar resources in the country.
“The grid constraints will likely have some positive outcomes as a distribution of projects across other provinces will likely lead to more distributed socioeconomic development benefits for the country,” Ahlfeldt further explained. “For projects that aren't selected as part of the Round 5, there is still potential for them to go ahead, given the recent change to regulations which allows for projects up to 100 MW to be developed in the country without a license.”

These systems have a total generation capacity of around 298.7 MW.
That figure indicates around 190 MW of new net-metered capacity has been added since the last set of statistics was released, in September 2019. Such exponential growth demonstrates strong interest for residential and commercial PV in Dubai.
In August 2019, DEWA reported requests to access the emirate’s net metering scheme had reached a combined capacity of 323 MW.
Launched in 2015, the Shams Dubai scheme allows owners of residential and commercial PV systems to sell surplus power to the grid at the same price they would pay for consuming it – at the end of the month, the net amount is billed to the customer.
The emirate is targeting to produce three-quarters of its total electricity from renewable energy sources by 2050. Large-scale solar is supported through tenders for Dubai’s 5 GW Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, the largest solar project in the United Arab Emirates – and Middle East – to date.

Whilst that figure was short of the national target of 100 MW of photovoltaics in 2020, the news the nation saw 13.76 MW of new solar last year is remarkable, given Lebanon is teetering on the brink of an economic and political collapse.
With rooftop solar systems, backed by a net-metering regime, providing the backbone of Lebanese solar, LCEC executive director Rani Al Anchkar told pv magazine at least 865 net-metered systems were installed and operational by the end of April this year.
Thus far, government attempts to attract utility-scale solar have not borne fruit.
Lebanon’s failure to make a bond payment last year led to its first sovereign default. With national debt spiraling, the Lebanese pound falling to record lows and people increasingly unable to source even basic goods, there is huge unrest among citizens, many of whom accuse the nation's political elite of bad governance, corruption and incompetence.
Such criticism appeared to be tragically confirmed on August 4 last year, when a large amount of ammonium nitrate which had been stored without sufficient safety measures at the Port of Beirut exploded, killing at least 218 people and leaving around 300,000 homeless.
The blast incited public anger and led to the resignation of the government, although Lebanese president Michel Aoun subsequently asked the cabinet to stay on in a caretaker capacity which remains in force today. Attempts to form a new government appear bound to fail unless parliamentarians step outside the political elite to form a cabinet committed to reform.
The international community, led by France and the European Union, have made clear there will be no financial aid for Lebanon until there is a government willing to reform the economy, including the energy market. Meanwhile, Lebanese citizens face dire shortages of medicines, fuel and electricity daily and the national currency has lost around 90% of its value against the dollar, driving hyperinflation.
Electricity users are either seeking to run diesel generators or install solar-plus-battery systems. Accessing diesel at punitively high prices on the black market is a risky business which has driven unprecedented demand for solar and storage systems. The sellers of PV and home battery systems, however, demand payment in foreign currency, forcing prices up beyond the reach of many citizens.
The LCEC's report on the state of Lebanese solar in 2020 is expected soon but it is the 2021-related numbers, due out late next year, which could reveal the extent of any surge in small scale solar and storage systems.
The €80 million Lebanon Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Finance Facility, which offered low-interest loans to enable private sector entities to install renewables and energy efficiency measures, “expired [at] the end of 2020, mainly due to the currency devaluation and the economic crisis,” Al Anchkar told pv magazine.
The program, started in 2018, had been bankrolled by EU lender the European Investment Bank and France's development agency, with the loans coordinated by the Central Bank of Lebanon.
National energy agency the LCEC is also finalizing a report into the dozen or so solar systems damaged in last year's port blast, including a 220 kW array which was commissioned on the roof of wheat silos which were destroyed by the explosion just ten days later.
The agency said at least a dozen more solar arrays were damaged in the catastrophe and has shown pv magazine a map of the systems concerned.
This copy was amended on 23/08/21 to indicate the LCEC prepares an annual update on solar statistics, and to include Rani Al Anchkar's name at the LCEC's request.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/23/air-source-heat-pumps-raise-home-prices/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 23, 2021",Air source heat pumps raise home prices,"A group of scientists from the University of Maryland, College Park, the University of Rhode Island, and the Carnegie Mellon University, in the United States, has estimated how the deployment of an air source heat pump may increase house values across 23 states and has found that buyers are ready to pay a price premium of between 4.3 and 7.1% if a similar system for space heating is part of the property for sale.
The researchers utilized the difference-in-differences approach, which compares the changes in outcomes over time between a population enrolled in a program – the, so-called treatment group – and a population that is not: the, so-called comparison group. They also used data from the Zillow Transaction and Assessment Database (ZTRAX), which is an open-access real estate database for academic, non-profit, and policy researchers. “Based on the heat pump installation dates, we categorized the transaction prices as pre or post-treatment prices,” they explained. “The control group consists of the houses using the same types of heating and cooling systems, other than heat pumps, across all the assessments, and sold at least twice during a similar data window.”
According to their findings, the estimated price premiums would be larger than the heat pump installation costs of heat pumps and the calculated total social benefits of switching to heat pumps. The premiums, however, would also depend on the region and the demographic groups. “We examined the heterogeneity of the price premium by investigating  the correlation of the price premium with several other important  factors, including residents’ environmental awareness at the county level; air source heat pump adoption rate at the county level; personal income per capita at the county level; [and] average annual heating degree days (HDD) [a measure of the volume of energy required to heat a building], and annual cooling degree days, from 1981 to 2010, at the meteorological station level,” the U.S. group emphasized.
Through this analysis, the academics came to the conclusion that residents that are environmentally conscious, middle class, or live in regions with a mild climate are most likely to pay the higher price premium for a house equipped with an air source heat pump. In regions where the heat pump penetration rate is larger, however, the price premium is lower, which the scientists attributed to lower installations costs, as well as lower information searching and transaction costs.
The price premium is estimated between $10,400 and $17,000 per transaction and the average cost for installing an air source heat pump is around $8,000. “The relatively high price premium (compared with the installation cost) can be explained by the transaction cost, information searching cost and cognitive cost,” the scientists highlighted. “In an equilibrium resale market, the house price premium approximates the sum of the installation cost, transaction cost, information searching cost and cognitive cost.” Cognitive costs relate to the need for consumers to gain an understanding of new technology and its financial aspects.
The findings of the research can be found in the paper Estimation of change in house sales prices in the United States after heat pump adoption, published in nature energy.
Other researchers at the University of Rhode Island have also recently analyzed how solar parks affect the value of nearby houses. They found that U.S. homeowners are prepared to pay $279 per year to avoid living within a mile of a solar plant.

NTPC Ltd, India’s largest integrated energy company, has commissioned a 25 MW floating solar project on the reservoir of its Simhadri thermal power station, in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.
The plant, built with more than 1 lakh (100,000) of solar modules, spans 75 acres on the water surface and uses a unique anchoring design for the panels.
The floating project is expected to generate enough electricity to light around 7,000 households and to offset at least 46,000 tons of CO2 during its lifetime. It could also prevent 1,364 million liters of water evaporating annually – enough to meet the yearly requirement of 6,700 households.
NTPC has 66.9 GW of power generation capacity across 71 power stations, including 29 renewable energy projects. The group says it also has more than 17 GW of power plant capacity under construction, including 5 GW of renewables. NTPC is aiming to install 60 GW of renewables capacity by 2032.
