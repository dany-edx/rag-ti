Germany's I.F.I. Institut für Industrieaerodynamik GmbH supported the company in measuring the wind resistance of the system.
“Wind tunnel tests on a 1:50 model equipped with 360 pressure taps were performed in a large boundary layer wind tunnel laboratory at I.F.I. Aachen,” CEO Trygve Mongstad told pv magazine. “Tests were done for different building heights and at different angles of attack on the building.”
Previous tests conducted by Fraunhofer ISE certified that the vertical system has no lift, even at wind speeds up to 47 meters per second, according to Mongstad.
“All measurements and analysis are in accordance with the German Standards DIN EN 1991-1-4:2010-12, DIN EN 1991-1-4/NA:2010-12 and the wind tunnel testing guideline of the German/Austrian/Swiss Wind Engineering Association, WtG, as well as EN 1991-1-4:2005,” he said. “Furthermore, they comply with international codes such as ASCE 7-22 and ASCE 49-21.”
The simulations showed that the system can function without ballast or fastening to the rooftop, according to his statement.
The company currently uses PERC cells with a bifaciality of 77% to 81% or HJT cells with a bifaciality of 90% in its demonstrators. The PV system, which includes a mounting system and solar panels, comes in a single pre-assembled package, making them easily mountable. Each unit measures 1,600 mm x 1,510 mm x 350 mm, weighs 24.5 kg, and features an IP68 enclosure rating and 3.2 mm double-tempered glass.
Over Easy plans to collaborate with production partners in China and Spain to begin manufacturing the solar modules. Currently, it uses solar cells from undisclosed Asian manufacturers.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/29/foldable-textured-silicon-wafers-for-flexible-heterojunction-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 29, 2023","Foldable, textured silicon wafers for flexible heterojunction solar cells","Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have successfully created foldable crystalline silicon (c-Si) wafers, known for their strong light-harvesting capability, for use in flexible silicon heterojunction (HJT) solar cells.
The scientists said HJT cell technology is ideal for making flexible solar cells, as it eliminates edge warping caused by inner stress during the firing process. The wafers were developed with blunting treatment, a technique commonly used to round a wafer's edges, in order to prevent chipping and cracking during processing. The researchers said that the treatment resulted in a transition of the fracture mechanism from intrinsic brittle cleavage fracture to shear banding with steps and cracks.
The research team used 180 μm Czochralski n-type c-Si wafers, supplied by China-based Sichuan Yongxiang, to create textured wafers with a thickness of 60 μm.
“The wafers were textured in a 2.1-vol% alkali water solution at 80 C for 10 min to form microscale pyramids on the surfaces,” it explained. “All wafers were cleaned using a standard root cause analysis (RCA) process to remove organics and metal ions. Next, they underwent cleaning in 2.0% hydrofluoric acid water solution for 3 min to etch the surface oxide.”
The academics used the wafers to produce two HJT cells with thicknesses of 65 μm and 55 μm. The first cell had a power conversion efficiency of 23.31%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.752 V, a short-circuit current density of 0.09 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 82.40%. The second cell hit an efficiency of 23.35%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.754 V, a short-circuit current density of 0.11 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 82.51%.
The group then applied an anti-reflective coating based on magnesium fluoride (MgF2) on the cells and their efficiency was raised to 24.50%.
“Although this value was lower than that (25.83%) of a thick cell because it was affected by the inferior light-harvesting ability of the thinner wafer, it was a remarkable efficiency compared with that of the current flexible solar cells fabricated from other cost-effective materials,” the scientists said, noting that the use of a 60-μm wafer could reduce production costs by approximately 29%. “Overall, the flexible technology developed in this study reduced the levelized cost of energy by approximately 39% (23%) at the solar cell (module) level.”
The academics presented the new manufacturing process in “Flexible solar cells based on foldable silicon wafers with blunted edges,” which was recently published in Nature. The research group includes scientists from China's Tongwei (TW), the Changsha University of Science and Technology, Southwest Petroleum University, Soochow University, and Beihang University,

The new system is designed for commercial and industrial applications and has a capacity of 100 kW. It is currently being tested a the Tokyo Tech Environmental Energy Innovation (EEI) Building, where it receives green hydrogen from a PV system and storage racks for hydrogen generated from waste plastic.
“The system is the first in the world to mix renewable energy hydrogen and waste plastic hydrogen, supply the mixture to a fuel cell, and connect it to the building's air conditioning system for advanced use of electricity and heat,” said the Japanese consortium.
The demonstrator is designed to establish an urban hydrogen energy utilization model that appropriately mixes global hydrogen and local hydrogen.
The project uses fuel cell technology supplied by Toshiba – the H2Rex system. The Japanese company says the solid polymer fuel cells are capable of tracking load changes because of their ability to change power output, making them ideal for energy generation applications. The company said that the system can boot up in around five minutes.

Bilbao Kirolak, a municipal company under the Bilbao City Council in Spain, has announced the closure of the part of the San Inazio Sports Center due to a roof collapse. The rest of the facility in the city of Bilbao remains open and operational. The cause of the collapse is now under investigation.
Mayor Juan Mari Aburto stated in a local radio interview that heavy rains and the presence of numerous solar panels on the sports center's rooftop may have caused the collapse.
The solar panels were installed in 2010 after Inbisa Construcción was awarded the project, making it the largest photovoltaic roof in Bizkaia at the time. The project originally consisted of 120 solar panels, but based on the photograph of the collapse, an estimated 168 solar panels were present. The total investment in the project by the company amounted to €411,000 ($440,797).

Indian manufacturer Gautam Solar is adding a 500 MW of TOPCon module production line, bringing its total panel production capacity to 1 GW.  The line will start operations by September. 
Gautam Solar will procure the fully automated, n-type TOPCon production line from Jinchen. The supply deal between the two companies was signed at SNEC, 16th International Photovoltaic Power Generation and Smart Energy Conference and Exhibition. 
TOPCon is an advanced solar module production technology. It features a thin tunneling oxide layer on an n-type silicon substrate, followed by a layer of highly doped polysilicon and passivated contacts. The tunnel oxide layer enables charge carriers to pass through with minimal recombination losses, while the passivated contacts reduce surface recombination. This technology improves solar module efficiency and reduces panel degradation over time.
N-type TOPCon cells can produce up to 30% more power than conventionally used p-type PERC cells.

The Empresa de Desenvolvimento e Infraestruturas do Alqueva (EDIA), controlled by the Ministry of Agriculture of Portugal, has launched an international tender for the construction of five floating photovoltaic plants. These plants will be located in the reservoirs of Ferreira do Alentejo, Almeidas, Pias, Penedrão, and Monte Novo.
The five projects will have a combined capacity of 4.5 MW and require a total investment of around €4.3 million ($4.6 million).
The tender includes the maintenance of the facilities for three years from entry into operation.
The plants will feed the adjacent pumping stations, with an estimated annual production of 7 GWh.
It is anticipated that this is the first of a set of four tenders that will be launched at the end of summer, in a global investment of about €60 million that will correspond to the installation of about 70 MW.
EDIA's intention is to replicate the success of the floating solar plant installed in the Cuba-Este reservoir, in operation since 2020.
Portuguese researchers from the University of Évora recently found that the installed capacity of floating solar systems could exceed the 7 GW target defined in the country’s National Energy and Climate Plan 2030.

The Ikea microgrid features a 1.2 MW rooftop solar system installed across the furniture retailer’s expansive Adelaide store, coupled with a 3 MW/3.45 MWh battery energy storage system backed by Planet Ark Power’s eleXsys energy management system for surplus export.
Designed and built by Planet Ark Power, the AUD 6.6 million ($4.3 million) solar and storage microgrid will be owned and operated by South Australia-headquartered energy infrastructure company Epic Energy. Epic Energy CEO Clive D’Cruz said the system is not only providing power to the Ikea Adelaide store but will also provide support to the South Australia’s electricity network with the battery allowing the operator to ‘time-shift’ solar energy.
D’Cruz said surplus clean energy stored in the microgrid’s battery can be traded on the National Electricity Market (NEM) during hours of peak demand, supporting grid stability and reliability through participation in Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) markets.
“Investing in Australia’s first-of-its-type urban microgrid supports our offtake partner Ikea in achieving their climate-positive goals while benefiting the local community through supporting grid stability,” he said.
Planet Ark Power Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Ruddick said the integration of the company’s eleXsys technology has transformed the Ikea store into an “unconstrained, grid-connected commercial microgrid.”
“The microgrid not only maximises clean energy generation in SA, but also avoids expensive network upgrades and provides grid support to the state’s electricity network, benefitting the wider South Australian community,” he said. “Use of the eleXsys technology means being able to connect to up to 10 times more energy than solar technology and grid constraints currently allow.”
Ruddick said the capacity to actively trade renewable energy into the South Australian power network also provides a risk-reduced return on investment for the microgrid’s owners.
South Australia has one of the highest rates of rooftop solar penetration in the world, which, combined with wind generation, regularly meets 100% of the state’s energy needs but Department for Energy and Mining Major Projects Director Scott Oster said he is hopeful the project inspires other major retailers to play their part in the state’s energy transition.
“The South Australian government is excited to see this project demonstrate how smart technology will mean we can accommodate more rooftop solar in ways that actually help our grid stability,” he said. “This is another critical step in South Australia delivering a smart energy grid of the future. It is innovative solutions and forward-thinking like this that will be vitally important as we approach our target of 100% renewables by 2030.”
For Ikea, the microgrid will support the company’s goal of 100% renewable energy use at the Adelaide store by 2025.

Just as Oberlin College students were leaving campus this past week to enjoy their summer recess, a new group was entering campus by farm truck. On May 24, a class of 70 ewes from the Old Slate Farm in Knox County, Ohio, showed up on campus to begin chomping away at weeds, grass and other edible vegetation at the college’s 2.3 MW solar field.
Some 70 Katahdin breed sheep were dropped off on campus at Oberlin last week. There they will graze through mid-June, stomping grass and weeding the solar field in a move aimed at alleviating the need for costly operations and maintenance, according to a report by the school.
Additional sheep drops this summer will bring the total number of grazers at Oberlin’s on-site solar facility to between 150 and 200 heads of sheep.
The sheep will be delivered to the college’s solar field three times per year over the spring, summer, and fall season. A form of agrivoltaics, where land is used for both agriculture and energy generation, the sheep’s handiwork will reduce Oberlin’s emissions from fossil fuel. It is also expected to reduce regular damage to equipment that results from mowing a rough terrain.
Oberlin signed an agreement with Old Slate Farm in April to begin deploying the sheep grazers before summer.

NREL says in a new report that there is strong global demand for PV. China remains the frontrunner for solar deployment, growing its installations by 57% year on year in 2022, representing 42% of global demand. Most of China’s installations are smaller distributed projects, rather than large, centralized utility-scale projects, said the International Energy Agency. NREL says analysts expect global installations to reach 300 GW this year and 400 GW by 2025.
In the United States, PV represented about 46% of new electricity generation capacity additions in 2022. Yet solar has a long way to grow to play its part as a core technology in the energy transition. PV represents 9% of net summer capacity and 4.7% of annual generation in 2022, said NREL.
California has made the longest strides in solar, with 27.3% of its electricity generation being sourced from solar. Solar has at least a 5% share in the generation mix in 16 states as of the end of 2022.
The latest issue of pv magazine celebrates China’s journey from solar new entrant to the installation of more than 100 GW(AC) of panels this year – Vincent Shaw and Frank Haugwitz consider a remarkable 20-year journey. We take a look at what Indonesia needs to achieve its net-zero ambition and also explore the stirrings of a solar renaissance in Europe, via buzzing trade shows and gigafatory planning.
