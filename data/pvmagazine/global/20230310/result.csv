District heating is a type of heat network that usually uses natural gas to power a centralized heat production facility, or energy center. The heat is distributed through a pipe network that connects the energy center with different buildings, creating a heat network which is commonly defined as “central heating for cities.”
The researchers configured a network of heating pipes for three buildings of the KITC located in lsan, South Korea. The network uses a 310 kW ground-source heat pump as a heating source, paired with solar thermal collectors and a 10 kW fuel-cell system ran by natural gas. Two 994 square meter solar thermal arrays were installed in the parking lot and rooftop of one of the buildings, according to a KICT statement. The heat trading system also includes two hot water storage tanks with capacities of 40 m3 and 10 m3.
“When there is enough sunlight, hot water for heating is supplied by solar heat to the secondary pipe of district heating through a heat exchanger,” KICT explains in its statement. “When there is insufficient sunlight, hot water can be supplied through the heat pump system and the fuel-cell system.” The solution can be controlled both manually and automatically at the integrated control center, according to KICT.
Residential solar combined with heat pump systems often produce excess heat due to a mismatch between the building’s heat demand, usually higher at night, and the renewables-based heat supply, stronger during the day. KICT’s solution was designed to minimize heating losses by allowing buildings to export this excess heat to the heat network through the so-called secondary pipe.
“The system has the potential to increase the use of renewable heat energy in cities and buildings, which will ultimately reduce their carbon emissions,” said researcher Yongki Kim.
The team first presented a computational fluid dynamics model to evaluate the required pipe insulation of the system in “Pipe Insulation Evaluation for Low-Temperature District Heating Implementation in South Korea,” published in Frontiers in Energy Research.
It now claims that the demonstration project shows “that the twin [bi-directional] pipe is effective in the network of low-temperature heat pipes with about 10% heat loss.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/10/esg-credentials-of-eu-solar-manufacturers-could-bolster-revival/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"MARCH 10, 2023",EU solar manufacturers’ ESG credentials could bolster revival,"With the European Commission’s keenly anticipated Net-Zero Industry Act set to be published on March. 14, the ways in which aspirant and exiting European manufacturers can be supported was a central theme of presentations and panel discussions at the 2023’s SolarPower Summit in Brussels. While the Net-Zero act looks likely to introduce domestic content provisions for the public procurement of solar, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria could also be applied in policy measurers to support European solar producers.
That fostering European solar manufacturing is an urgent necessity in terms of securing long-term energy security was oft-repeated theme during discussions at the summit.
International Energy Agency (IEA) Executive Director Fatih Birol was unequivocal in his advocacy for a substantial expansion in European solar making. He made the call at the SolarPower Summit’s plenary session.
“It is time for Europe to look at the manufacturing of solar,” said Birol, before adding that despite the region’s urgent need to install PV it will remain an importer of solar technology, but that “Europe can have a share.”
“20 years ago, Europe started solar manufacturing,” noted Fatih, likening the solar production race as being a marathon, in which Europe excelled over the race’s first quarter. “But no one wins the gold medal after the first 10km. It is important for Europe to come with incentives, regulatory and financial instruments [to support solar manufacturing].”
It is far from the first time that the case for European PV manufacturing, on the grounds of energy security, has been made. The European Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson famously said that the European Commission would do “whatever it takes” to support manufacturing efforts at the SolarPower Summit in 2022.
Simson addressed summit attendees again this year, where she said switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy “should not mean replacing one dependence with another.” As such, the commissioner added: “Europe needs to up its game and diversify its supply. We have achieved a lot, but the work is not done yet. The Commission will be by your side every step of the way.”
European policymakers had strengthened the EU Solar Industry Alliance, Simson noted, with an aim to achieve 30 GW of PV module production capacity by 2025 – including upstream components such as ingots, wafers, and cells. She added that solar manufacturing will be supported under the EU Green Deal Industrial Plan.
The European Commission opened the way for additional support during the SolarPower Summit with European Union rules regarding the state aid for industry being relaxed for solar and other clean technology producers.
The measures are a part of the European Commission’s Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework and it appears to be a positive development that will allow EU member governments to provide financial support to prospective and existing manufacturers.
Difficult to access
However, there was some criticism of existing EU support measures from solar manufacturers during the summit.
Both Meyer Burger and Enel Green Power are pursuing gigawatt-scale integrated cell and module manufacturing facilities in Germany and Italy respectively. However, these projects pale in comparison to massive new factories being developed in India, and the flurry of activity across the Atlantic in the United States. Both countries offer generous market protections and subsidy programs for manufacturers, including India’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme and the Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
Meyer Burger CEO Gunter Erfurt and Eliano Russo, the head of Enel’s 3Sun Gigafactory, acknowledged that their manufacturing projects were the beneficiaries of public funds.
Of the €600 million ($641 million) that has been invested in its 3Sun facility, Russo said that roughly one-third had come from public funds – from the EU Innovation Fund and Italian government grants. However, he added that it took a great deal of time and resources to access such funding.
“We are still in discussion to get financial close,” said Russo. “A company like Enel can surmount these challenges [but] all of these inefficiencies require a lot of attention.”
Meyer Burger’s Erfurt said that of the €340 million that the Swiss-based company had invested in its manufacturing operations, €35 million came in the form of regional-government grants – from the German states of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt. “But compared to China and the IRA it is a drop in the ocean,” he said.
Erfurt added that €15 million of the subsidies his company had received were by virtue of Meyer Burger having proven that its solar cell production is “the most environmentally friendly” technology. The company is producing silicon heterojunction (HJT) PV cells, which are thinner than standard crystalline silicon (c-Si) cells and use a lead-free cell metalization and interconnection technology – the latter branded Smartwire by Meyer Burger in the company’s previous life as a solar production equipment supplier.
“We’ve been able to raise €850 million from the private sector,” in the form of capital investment and certified green convertible bonds. By contrast, Erfurt argued, “my observation is that the downstream industry isn’t ESG yet” and that they were deploying PV modules that were tainted with forced labor, that there was lead in the modules, and that some modules had a “very high carbon footprint.”
As simple as ESG
It is conceivable that ESG metrics and criteria could be used by policymakers to offer protection to European solar producers.
Christian Westermeier, from German polysilicon producer Wacker Chemie, said that while European “ecolabels” could be a helpful tool in distinguishing European solar products, he called for a standardization of labeling initiatives.
“Europe has set the benchmark for ESG and for solar it’s an obligation to follow ESG rules”, said Westermeier. “Such a label could give orientation for consumers and investors and create a level playing field for the goods that we are producing in Europe.”
This is a message to Brussels that is shared by German inverter producer SMA. The company is in the process of doubling its production capacity and doesn’t see a reason to stop there. “All we are asking for is a level playing field,” says Katharina Eickelberg, who heads communications and sustainability at SMA. “We are ready to start.”
SolarPower Europe reports that the “sold out” SolarPower Summit attracted over 350 attendees.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/10/switzerland-to-introduce-subsidies-for-alpine-pv/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,SWITZERLAND",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"MARCH 10, 2023",Switzerland to subsidize alpine PV,"In September 2022, Switzerland made amendments to its Energy Act focusing on urgent measures to secure power supply in winter. The new federal law aims to enable and facilitate the construction of large-scale ground-mounted PV systems in the Swiss Alps, 1,500 meters or higher above sea level.
Details on the law have so far been scarce. Ahead of the official publication expected for April 2023, co-author of the IEA-PVPS Task 1 report on PV applications in Switzerland, Lionel Bloch, told pv magazine the “idea is to really focus on winter PV production because in Switzerland we have better system yield (kWh/kWp) in the mountains than at lower altitudes, where there is a high concentration of clouds.”
The measures will purportedly incentivize alpine PV projects with an annual energy production of at least 10 GWh, equivalent to an installed capacity of at least 8 MW, according to Bloch.
The Swiss government will purportedly provide subsidies for up to 60% of the installation costs of eligible projects. “This includes the costs for cables, which can be very expensive in alpine PV,” said Bloch. “Costs for these alpine projects are around CHF 6 ($6.47)/W, compared to about CHF 1.2/W for urbane installations. With these very high subsidies, it can still be profitable for the owner.”
To classify for the subsidy, the projects must show a winter yield of at least 500 kWh/kWp, which Bloch says is most likely in alpine conditions. To meet this requirement, developers will probably focus on vertical PV installations and exploit the higher albedo of bifacial modules.
The winter yield will most likely be measured over a period of three years, says Bloch. “There is a risk involved for project owners because if the yield condition isn’t met, the subsidy isn’t paid – but the law can also change.”
The Swiss government aims to reach 2 TWh of alpine PV production with the incentive scheme.
In September 2022, Swiss energy company Axpo commissioned a 2.2 MW vertical alpine PV project on the Muttsee Dam, almost 2,500 meters above sea level.

“Together with the amendment to the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER) that the Commission endorsed today, the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework will help speeding up investment and financing for clean tech production in Europe,” the EC said in a statement.
The new provisions are expected to enable member states to implement support programs for renewable energy and energy storage that are running until the end of 2025 by simplifying the conditions for the granting of aid to small projects and less mature technologies, as well as by reducing the need for competitive auctions.
The new rules should help deploy all types of renewable energy sources, including industrial processes switching to hydrogen-derived fuels, and define higher aid ceilings and calculations.
Moreover, the framework should enable investment support for the manufacturing of batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, heat pumps, electrolyzers and carbon capture technologies. “Member States may grant even higher percentages of the investment costs if the aid is provided via tax advantages, loans or guarantees,” the EC said. “Before granting the aid, national authorities must nevertheless verify the concrete risks of the productive investment not taking place within the European Economic Area and that there is no risk of provoking relocation within the single market.”
The European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC) said the new framework will be the basis of Europe's future manufacturing ecosystem.
“ESMC highly welcomes the proposals of the European Commission, but still expresses doubts about the practical efficiency of the proposed State aid exemptions, due to the comparatively low aid intensity and rather complicated process to achieve higher support for individual companies,” the association said in a statement.
“ESMC’s position is that the risk of provoking relocation within the single market should not be overestimated, hence the bigger issue is that the global PV manufacturing race in the forthcoming months and years is being severely underestimated.”
According to the ESMC, member states will be allowed to support PV manufacturing industry by 15% to 35% of capital expenditures for large enterprises and by 35% to 55% for small enterprises by 35% to 55%. “The support through tax advantages, loans or guarantees large enterprises would be feasible by 20% to 40% for large enterprises (for medium enterprises by 30% to 50%, for small enterprises by 40% to 60%) depending on the economic development area,” it further explained.

Netze BW will keep a 30% hydrogen blend for some months to generate better data on home heating in detached family homes. “In the following phase of the project, we will introduce oscillations from 0 to 30% hydrogen. Volatile mixtures will simulate real-life volatility typical of energy systems with an increase in renewable energies.” Netze BW, which operates the distribution grid in large parts of Baden-Württemberg region, said that 100% hydrogen in the grid in the future would be possible. The company will share the data coming from the Oehringen “hydrogen island” with all the European grid operators to show that gas grids can be used in the clean energy transition. Netze BW started to use a hydrogen blend for the company's appliances in November 2021, introducing a hydrogen-gas blend for customers in 2022. Last year, the company also tested all the appliances in the Oehringen network with a blend of up to 35% hydrogen.
Toyota‘s new electrolysis equipment using the fuel cell stack and other technology from the Mirai vehicle will be put into operation this March at a Denso Fukushima Corporation plant. “It will serve as a technology implementation venue to promote its widespread use going forward,” said the Japanese car manufacturer. Toyota added it would accelerate its efforts to build a model for the local consumption of locally produced hydrogen, using electrolysis equipment to produce clean hydrogen and combust it in one of the plant's gas furnaces.
The Climate Change Committee said that hydrogen is related to three of the ten priorities to deliver a reliable decarbonized power system in the UK. The UK's independent adviser on tackling climate change underlined that the government should identify priority hydrogen investments by 2024, finalize by the end of the year ad-hoc funding mechanisms to support the development of 10 GW of low-carbon hydrogen production, and fast-track the development of new business models for hydrogen transportation. The report sees a limited role of hydrogen in heating.  
Researchers at Australia's Monash University have isolated an enzyme that can convert minute concentrations of hydrogen in the atmosphere to produce a sustained electrical current, paving the way toward a future where devices are literally powered out of thin air. The research team, led by Rhys Grinter, Ashleigh Kropp, and Chris Greening from the Monash University Biomedicine Discovery Institute in Melbourne, isolated and analyzed the genetic code of an enzyme that enables a common soil bacteria to consume hydrogen and extract energy from it.
The Atlantic Council said that green hydrogen could spur development in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially in South Africa, Namibia, and Kenya. “Following the hydrogen valley model, the Southern Corridor Development Initiative is a partnership between the Namibian Green Hydrogen Council and the German firm Hyphen Hydrogen Energy. The project is expected to produce 300,000 tons of green hydrogen by 2030 from 5 GW to 6 GW of installed renewable energy capacity,” said the Atlantic Council. According to the report, the export potential depends on finding a solution to local energy poverty, inequities between nations, and energy networks within the region.

The group, which also includes Dredging, Environmental and Marine Engineering NV (DEME), marine offshore specialist Jan De Nul and Ghent University, is planning to deploy its first demonstrator off the Belgian coast in the summer of 2023.
Called Seavolt, the floating platform is reportedly able to withstand difficult offshore conditions.
“The modular design allows for easy adaptation to different sites and demands,” the consortium said in a statement, without providing further technical details. “Benefits include local renewable energy production and the possibility to install the panels in offshore windfarms. Another advantage is the addition of large volumes of renewable energy capacity in a relatively short time.”
Tractebel is also working on another offshore solar project in the North Sea. The group includes DEME, solar installer Soltech NV and Ghent University and is planning to install a €2 million array near an aquaculture farm and offshore wind project.
In a study published in 2020, scientists from Utrecht University in the Netherlands claimed offshore PV plants could be more productive than ground-mounted arrays after running a simulation comparing a North Sea project to a conventional system at the Utrecht Photovoltaic Outdoor Test field.

Researchers at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro have developed a mathematical model to calculate the potential for floating solar generation in Brazil, detailing results for each state.
The study only considers potential generation on artificial bodies of water, such as hydroelectric plants and dams, and on only 1% of their available area. The team used the National Water Agency database and QGIS software to filter the artificial water bodies, which total 174,526, excluding those on indigenous lands.
The model’s input variables are not only solar irradiance, but also temperature, including annual average air surface temperature, and annual average wind speed. “This paper differs from other studies that usually only consider solar resources, disregarding that the efficiency of photovoltaic modules is very susceptible to temperature,” the researchers said.
The modeled floating photovoltaic system uses modules from Brazilian module manufacturer Globo Brasil with a capacity of 320 W and an efficiency of 16.49%. The model assumes that each megawatt of floating solar covers approximately 10,512 square meters.
The results show that Brazil could generate 79.37 GWh of electricity from floating solar per year, equivalent to a potential installed capacity of 43.28 GW. Approximately 72% of this potential corresponds to hydroelectric plants, with a potential installed capacity of 31.5 GW and generation of 57.38 GWh per year.
This floating solar potential corresponds to almost the entire annual electricity generation of Brazil’s largest hydroelectric plant Itaipu, and 12.7% of all electricity generation in Brazil. It could provide electricity to 41 million Brazilian households, 56% of the total.
The Northeast region has the greatest potential, combining the best solar irradiance and the largest number of artificial water bodies, with 10.58 GW or 24.5% of the total. It is followed by the Southeast with 10.08 GW (23.3%), the North with 8.5 GW (19.7%), the Center with 8.2 GW (18.9%), and the South with 5.93 GW (13.7%).
The results for each state are as follows:
“Covering only 1% of the surfaces of artificial bodies of water, it would be possible to supply 39% of the electricity consumption in the Center-West, 25% in the Northeast, 42% in the North, 8% in the Southeast, and 12% in the South. The state of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) had all its consumption supplied and could still export the generated energy to another state,” the scientists concluded.
They presented their results in “Technical potential of floating photovoltaic systems on artificial water bodies in Brazil,” published in Renewable Energy.

Silfab Solar, a North American solar module manufacturer with facilities in Washington state and Toronto, Canada, announced a new round of funding led by ARC Financial Corp. The $125 million investment is expected to help Silfab expand its facilities and launch a third cell and module fabrication in the United States. 
Silfab’s third facility, a 1 GW cell production and 1.2 GW module assembly plant, is expected to reach operations in 2024. The site is expected to create over 800 U.S. jobs. Details on the facility site location will be shared at a later date. 
The cell production capacity addresses a critical solar module value chain constraint for U.S.-based solar manufacturing.
“Silfab has grown more than 40 percent since ARC’s initial support,” said Silfab's CEO Paolo Maccario. “Our growth means more solar jobs for America and reliable energy that customers will use to reduce both costs and their carbon footprint.” 
The funding round was led by ARC’s Fund 9 and included co-investments from Manulife Financial Corporation, Ontario Power Generation Inc. Pension Plan, CF Private Equity and BDC Capital’s Cleantech Practice. The investment marks ARC’s “continued confidence” in Silfab’s 40 years of experience in the solar industry. 
“Silfab is ideally situated to meet North America’s growing appetite for domestically manufactured cutting-edge solar products. ARC remains confident that Silfab will be a driver in clean tech manufacturing and U.S. engineered product innovation,” said Brian Boulanger, CEO of ARC. 
ARC’s first investment in the company, which took place in September 2021, totaled $100 million. It enabled Silfab to expand its existing Washington facility and make improvements to its production lines. 
In February 2022, Silfab announced a new series of solar modules with innovative conductive backsheets. The Elite Series includes the Elite 410 BG, a proprietary x-pattern module that combines an integrated cell design with a conductive backsheet, leading to gains in efficiency and power.  
The module provides 410 W, a module efficiency of 21.4%, and a max system voltage of 1000 Vdc. 
“With its all-black sleek look, Elite provides the aesthetics homeowners have been looking for,” said Maccario.
Maccario added that the modules are a result of the company’s 40-year record of technological and engineering experience. “Elite puts American solar products back on top,” he said.
Each Silfab production facility features multiple automated ISO 9001-2015 quality-certified production lines. The company operates just-in-time manufacturing to deliver Buy American approved PV modules designed for the North American market.
