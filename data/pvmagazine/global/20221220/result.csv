The University of New South Wales' (UNSW) solar-powered electric vehicle, the Sunswift 7, averaged nearly 85km/h over 12 hours to unofficially secure the record for the “Fastest electric vehicle over 1000 km on a single charge.”
The official honour – and Guinness World Record certificate – will be conferred once timing information and car telemetry data has been analysed and confirmed by a team of experts.
The car, designed and built by students involved in UNSW’s Sunswift program, posted a time of 11 hours 53.32 minutes for the 1,000 km distance at the Australian Automotive Research Centre in Wensleydale, Victoria.
The Sunswift Racing team is led by Richard Hopkins, who won four F1 world titles at his former post as head of operations at Red Bull, and has a big vision for the Sunswift program at UNSW. Intent on bringing research into broad and commercial applications, the Sunswift program today has a host of partnerships and sub-projects, and includes VIPV.
Hopkins says this world record shows what is possible and what can be achieved, albeit with a significant weight advantage over road legal cars which require features like airbags and air conditioning – components the Sunswift 7 car, built to race, has done away with.
The Sunswift 7 car weighs just 500 kg, about one quarter that of a Tesla, and boasts high efficiencies because of its aerodynamic design, motors and drive chain.
“During this record, the energy consumption was just 3.8 kWh/100km, whereas even the most efficient EVs on the road today only achieve a rating of 15kWh/100km and the average is around 20kWh/100km,” Hopkins added.

The claim is close to published reports of the Mercedes-Benz Vision EQXX solar concept car travelling 1,008 kilometres from Stuttgart in Germany to Cassis on the French Mediterranean coast, with an energy consumption of 8.7 kWh/100 km, on public roads, and over the Alps, in what Mercedes stated was 11 hours and 32 minutes of driving time, but a total travel time of  12 hours and 2 minutes, with average speed of 87.4 km/h.

The result of these price shocks has been that climate change, as the primary driver to date for the transition to renewable energy, has been surpassed by cost and energy security concerns.
Electricity from natural gas generation is now six times as expensive as wind power in some parts of Europe. The price disparity is driving renewable energy production – especially in markets where pricing structures ensure high levels of remuneration.

California has seen some of the most innovative municipalities take major steps forward towards a net-zero electricity grid. A good example is the Sacramento Municipal Utility District that is looking to work with ESS to deploy 200 MW/2 GWh of energy storage capacity which, when coupled with renewable energy sources, will remove the equivalent of 284,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions per year and provide enough energy to power 60,000 homes for 10 hours.
In Europe, the Russian war in Ukraine – and in particular the use of energy starvation as a strategy – has highlighted the need to move beyond reliance on energy from unreliable and unpredictable states. While the US has shown prescience in ensuring energy security, much of the world is now catching up.
In 2023, we can expect to see a silver lining of the crises which erupted in 2022 as renewable energy comes to the forefront, with mainstream investment in solar, wind, and energy storage.
Global supply chain and product availability has been severely disrupted over the past two years due to the pandemic, geopolitics, and trade barriers creating an imbalance between demand and supply. This imbalance is expected to continue to widen as demand for renewables grows rapidly in most major markets and supply struggles to keep pace.
Many producers of essential clean energy equipment, such as solar panels and inverters, are already sold out for several years, with new orders beginning from 2026. As a result, different players are entering long-term supply agreements and reserving manufacturing capacity. Competition for long term equipment supply is not limited to project developers and owners. Governments also recognize the stiff global competition for scarce resources.
The establishment of strategic reserves by market participants, to ensure equipment availability, is increasingly possible.
When US utilities decide to invest in solar and energy storage, their thinking will be as much about resilience as about cutting carbon emissions. With parts of the country ravaged by wildfires, floods, and other climate-driven crises, transmission from central generating facilities has become increasingly problematic. The deployment of micro-grids based on solar and energy storage protects against that vulnerability while also doing its bit for net-zero grid goals.
The emergence of solar and wind microgrids has been facilitated by the arrival of low cost and reliable battery energy storage.  From commercial and industrial applications in Pennsylvania to utility scale projects in California, demand for sustainable, resilient microgrids is growing.
The surge in investment in renewable energy is being matched by creativity in energy innovation; solar farms in northern Australia could soon be supplying electricity to Singapore and plans are developing for Moroccan solar and wind farms to power British homes.
These continent-scale grid projects, while seemingly at odds with the aforementioned trend towards microgrids, are in fact the perfect complement. Such one-way interconnections from clean-energy rich regions to demand centers will provide new energy sources that will cut costs, reduce energy vulnerability, and curb carbon emissions.
The vast Australia-ASEAN Power Link project will include a 10 GW solar park with a transmission line to supply power to Singapore. Construction is planned to start by the end of 2023 with commercial operation set to begin in 2027. The Power Link will cover almost 20% of the electricity consumption of Singapore and dramatically reduce the country's dependence on liquefied natural gas imports.
The Xlinks project set to bring solar energy from Morocco to the UK was scheduled to get under way next year, although the startup this week announced political upheaval in the UK has cost it a year. The project is intended to provide 10.5 GW of zero-carbon electricity from the sun and wind – enough to deliver 3.6 GW of reliable energy for an average of 20-plus hours per day. This would provide low-cost, clean power to more than seven million homes, with 2030 set as the original target date for that milestone, and equates to around 8% of the UK’s electricity needs.
Such global grid projects have been enabled by breakthroughs in two key technologies:

Scientists from Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) have once more broken the efficiency world record of tandem solar cells consisting of a silicon bottom cell and a perovskite top cell. The 32.5% efficiency record has been officially confirmed by the certifying institute European Solar Test Installation.
“This is a really big leap forward that we didn't foresee a few months ago,” said Steve Albrecht from HZB's perovskite tandem solar cell department. “All the teams involved at HZB, especially the teams from the PV Competence Center (PVcomB) and the HySPRINT Innovation Lab, have worked together excellently and with great dedication on this.
His team used an improved perovskite compound with a modificed surface. Silvia Mariotti and Eike Köhnen, both authors of the study, developed an interface modification in which charge recombination losses are largely suppressed. Furthermore, they applied special measurement methods to better understand the fundamental processes. These developments were then successfully transferred to tandem solar cells and combined with further optical improvements by Lea Zimmermann.
In recent years, there has been a continuous increase in efficiency values by various research institutions and photovoltaic companies worldwide. At the end of 2021, various teams from HZB achieved a then record value of 29.8% efficiency. To achieve this, they introduced special, periodic nanotextures into the solar cells. Then, this summer, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, was able to significantly surpass that value again, achieving 31.3% efficiency with a certified tandem cell.
Now the highest value of 32.5% efficiency was again achieved by the HZB. “We are very pleased about the renewed significant leap in efficiency. This demonstrates the high potential of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells to contribute to a sustainable energy supply and turnaround in the coming years,” said Albrecht.
HZB's chief scientific officer, Bernd Rech, noted that “at 32.5%, the solar cell efficiency of the HZB tandems is now in ranges previously only achieved by expensive III/V semiconductors.”
Just last week, Meyer Burger signed a multi-year cooperation agreement together with several research institutes in Germany and Switzerland, including HZB. This involves the industrialization of perovskite tandem solar cells and modules.

The 37.5 MW installation in Boundiali, in the northern part of the West African country, will sell electricity to CIE.
“After having experimented with fossil fuels and hydroelectricity, [Ivory Coast], which is rich in renewable energy potential, is about to commission its first solar power plant, marking its intention to vary its energy mix as much as possible,” said Noumory Sidibé, the director general of CIE
Germany's Development Bank KfW financed the €40 million project with €27 million through the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. The European Union added €9.7 million, and the government of Ivory Coast contributed the remaining sum.
In May, Saft – a subsidiary of France's TotalEnergies – was selected to build a 10 MW storage system to the solar project. It will install six of its Intensium Max High Energy containers, equipped with lithium-ion batteries. The energy storage system will provide capacity firming and PV smoothing services to the solar project, according to Saft.
The Boundiali project is part of the “Compact with Africa” program, an initiative that was launched in March 2017 by the Group of 20 leading economies countries under the German presidency. The program seeks to promote private investment in renewable energy development in Africa.
In May 2018, the Ivory Coast government said that a 25 MW solar project in the town of Benguébougou would be the country’s first solar plant. However, the Boundiali project, which was announced in October 2018, has reached the commissioning phase first.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Ivory Coast had 13 MW of cumulative solar capacity in 2021.

The package will help the company to partly finance the procurement and installation of grid-scale batteries, in order to provide transmission system operators with grid-balancing services.
The firm intends to build the battery system near Šibenik in Dalmatia.
“IE Energy said it would boost the 50 MW system to 110 MW by 2024. There is no storage facility in southeastern Europe yet with such a capacity,” Attaurrahman Ojindaram Saibasan, a power analyst at GlobalData, told pv magazine. “There is immense scope for energy storage in Croatia, predominantly for battery storage.”
GlobalData says that Croatia is now on target to meet its 36.4% renewable energy target by 2030. However, its recent investment in energy storage has not been accompanied by rapid solar PV development. The country might only add 2.5 MW of new solar capacity in 2022, and another 19 MW next year, according to the consulting firm.
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) says that Croatia had 309 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2021. GlobalData expects the country to reach 770 MW of cumulative solar capacity by 2030.
“Croatia’s largest state-owned power company HEP has announced plans to invest around $23 million annually until 2023 to install new capacity of 20 MW per year, as well as to complete 350 MW capacity by 2030,” said Saibasan.
Floating solar might be another promising avenue for the country, where space for ground-mounted large-scale PV projects is limited, according to Saibasan.
“Croatia may look to install floating solar PV plants in the Adriatic Sea to avoid land utilization by utility-scale solar PV projects,” he said.
