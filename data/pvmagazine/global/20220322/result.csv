Pointing to EV battery shortages last year, prompted by rampant demand and rising raw material costs, WoodMac consultant Jiayue Zheng today predicted the vehicle market which accounts for almost 80% of current battery demand will amount to 3TWh of device storage capacity by the end of the decade.
The US-owned analyst issued a press release today in which it predicted European battery manufacturers will overhaul their North American rivals this year as global storage companies plan to develop 300 sites with a total of more than 5.5TWh of annual manufacturing capacity by 2030.
The 90% share of global device manufacturing held by Asia-Pacific countries – and dominated by China – last year is expected to retreat to 69% this decade, according to Edinburgh-based, Verisk-owned WoodMac.
By that point, Europe will have cornered more than 20% of the world market, according to the analyst, although Chinese giant Catl – Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd – will continue to lead, provided it follows through on plans for more than 800GWh of manufacturing capacity. South Korean rival LG has stated plans for around 450GWh of factories by 2030, according to WoodMac, with Japanese brand Panasonic expected to be the world's third largest battery maker by that point, with annual production capacity of 300GWh.
A graphic issued by WoodMac, compiled from existing factory capacity and new project announcements, had Northvolt as the biggest European battery maker in 2030, with 150GWh of production capacity, and Farasis as North America's sole representative, with around 125GWh of lines, although the Californian company plans to reach that milestone in 2025.
The analyst said NCM batteries retained half of the global battery market last year.

Tesla boss Elon Musk insisted on coming to Berlin from California for the official start of production of the first gigafactory in Europe. Just outside the capital, in Grünheide, in Brandenburg, the first Tesla Model Y rolled off the assembly line on Tuesday, and Musk handed it over to the new owners. A total of 30 cars were handed over to customers.
Brandenburg's prime minister, Dietmar Woidke (SPD), also attended the commissioning ceremony; as did federal chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD); federal economics minister Robert Habeck; and Brandenburg's economics minister, Jörg Steinbach, and environment minister, Axel Vogel.
“The fact that you have chosen Brandenburg is good for Tesla and good for the future region of Berlin-Brandenburg,” explained Woidke in his speech at the opening of the factory. “Tesla is the outstanding example of Brandenburg's new economic dynamic. The first European gigafactory attracts a lot of attention everywhere. This ensures that our country becomes even better known as a high-tech location,” Woidke continued. The German state sees good opportunities to attract more investors. There are already plans for lithium-ion battery production in Brandenburg. Overall, a value chain for electromobility could emerge, so Woidke hopes.
🇩🇪🇩🇪 Danke Deutschland!! 🇩🇪🇩🇪
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 22, 2022
Musk tweeted “Thank you Germany” on the day of the opening, in German. He had announced the construction of the factory in Brandenburg in mid-November 2019. However, he only received the final approval two weeks ago. Before that, Tesla built at record speed at its own risk, and with some preliminary approval from the authorities. Numerous requirements still had to be met before production could start. Recently, the factory's water supply caused a stir but this issue seems to be solved now.
The factory will create thousands of jobs. Tesla plans to produce up to 500,000 Model Y electric vehicles at the Grünheide site in the first expansion stage. The vehicle weighs about two tons and is a mid-size SUV with a starting price of around €64,000. Fully charged, the range should be around 500km. In addition, a production facility for battery cell is already being constructed at the same site in Grünheide.

Cole went on to describe technological advancement as a key driver in overcoming many of the roadblocks to “a greener energy system,” noting that “the advantages of large-scale batteries in our growing world of renewables are well documented and supported.” 
“Energy storage is rapidly becoming a valued capacity solution for the National Electricity Market,” Cole continued, “given its fast and precise response and technical capability. The pace of advancement in this growing technology class is exciting and with it a breaking of the barriers to acceptance from market and network participants.” 
Cole singled out technological advances that will allow this combined BESS project to use “advanced inverter technology” allowing the facility to better provide network stability support. 
“Without a doubt, as the understanding of advanced inverters grows, we will see more smart technologies replacing rotating machines and accelerating Australia's transition to a clean energy future,” said Cole. 
Edify Energy and Tesla previously teamed up on the 25MW/50MWh Gannawarra Energy Storage System, integrated with the 50MW Gannawarra Solar Farm in the state of Victoria.

The new device is called the CompactPITCH XT35-VLOW and is claimed to be an ideal solution for Mediterranean roof architecture, which is usually built with red roof tiles.
According to the manufacturer, the device base plate has a thickness of only 20mm, which helps the aluminum hook be optimally used with flat battens, for example with monk and nun or Portuguese tiles.
“Installers save a lot of time because the new hook, unlike standard roof hooks for pitched roofs, has two positions in the vertical plane, instead of the usual plates with serrations and screws,” the company said in a statement. “All installers have to do is push the hook from the side into the guides of the base plate – and that's it.”

The new product is offered with both fastening screws, for simultaneous positioning and mounting, and positioning screws, for decentralized base plates or concrete anchors. “The base plate is fastened with wood screws,” it further explained. “Then the hook is fine-adjusted by moving it horizontally in one of the two guide levels. Only one wood screw is required for the final fastening.”
According to the company, the base plate can also be installed de-centrally, with a cantilevered base plate being attached to the substructure with wood screws. “The roof hook is fastened de-centrally using a hexagon socket and a threaded pin, which is clamped in the base plate by tightening it. The base plate can also easily be anchored in concrete,” said Aerocompact chief technology officer, Christian Ganahl.
If used in combination with Aerocompact's X40-X50 mounting rail, the hook can also enable the deployment of the panels in landscape mode.
The new product comes with a 25-year warranty.

After seven years of collaboration on different projects, and joint development work, Spanish PV production equipment company Mondragon Assembly has acquired 60% of China-based QHD Visual Automation Equipment Co Ltd. “This move will allow Mondragon to strengthen its position in the solar market by incorporating into its portfolio the newest laminator on the market,” a spokesperson from Mondragon told pv magazine.
The jointly developed device is the Pad-Press multi-stack laminator which Mondragon describes as the most efficient membrane-free laminating solution on the market.
In addition to offering “the highest performance, in terms of quality, in the lamination process,” the new solution allows for a substantial improvement in overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) due to a significant reduction in downtime, which reduces operating costs of the line. “This step has been key in the development of this new laminator,” said Oier Aliaga, director of solar business processes and responsible for the development of this new solution. “With the Pad-Press system, we have combined the best laminate quality with a solution that will allow our customers to considerably reduce operating costs as well as increase the availability of the machine.”
This new laminator is suitable for any type of photovoltaic module but it is specially designed for glass-glass modules and new applications such as building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and vehicle-integrated solar.
The solution also features an “innovative controlled hydraulic pressure system aimed at ensuring the highest quality, alignment, and uniformity of the panel, completely avoiding the edge-pinching effect,” said Mondragon Assembly.
QHD Visual Automation Equipment Co is a high-tech and experienced Chinese company engaged in the design and manufacture of PV module lamination equipment, automation and visual inspection systems. It has its headquarters located in the city of Qinghuangdao, where it provides automation solutions mainly for the solar, glass, and ceramics industries.
“The acquisition of QHD Visual Automation Equipment Co Ltd is part of the roadmap of our strategic plan, where we determined that we had to be proactive in the search for new alliances that would allow us to create new business opportunities and that would strengthen our competitive advantage over the competition,” said Iñaki Madina, director of Mondragon's solar business.

“[The] Horizon-XTR should be used in projects of more than 20MW in which undulating terrain occupies a significant part of the site's topography,” Arturo Herrero, Nextracker's VP for European sales, told pv magazine. “It allows for row flexibility and ground following without the added complexity and technological risk of articulated joints,” he added.
Traditional trackers must be built in “straight-line rows,” which requires lengthening the foundation piles, grading, or a combination of both, when a solar park is located on undulating terrain. The Horizon-XTR, according to the manufacturer, is designed to follow the natural contours of the existing ground and does not need to be installed in a single plane, reducing the length of foundation piles and minimizing grading.
“Earth movements are particularly difficult since they affect the photovoltaic project by a factor of three: first, having to carry out earth movements for grading; then, by repositioning the removed earth; and lastly, by solving the inevitable erosion and hydrology problems that result from the lack of a vegetated topsoil,” the company said.
The CEO and founder of the company, Dan Shugar, explained that the new product was created at the request of customers. “An important factor in Nextracker's DNA is listening to our customers, evaluating their requests and, where possible, integrating their suggestions in the development of our products,” he stated.

The Canadian business is working with compatriot fuel cell manufacturer Ballard Power Systems and with Austrian-owed automotive company AVL Powertrain UK. “We are substantially on track to showcase our road-going vehicles with customers in September 2022, as originally planned,” said Steve Gill, chief executive for automotive at First Hydrogen, last week. “Our joint development of this hydrogen fuel cell vehicle will set us apart as a market leader for fuel cell vehicles in the light-commercial space.”
Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE says it has developed a “universally applicable test stand” for kinetic investigations to analyze catalytic fixed-bed reactions under dynamic operating conditions. The compact system, called Kiss, can be used for technology demonstration in remote regions. “Compared to traditional kinetic reactors, Kiss is unique in terms of the speed of the measurement campaigns as well as the perfect control of the reactor temperature, even when the synthesis process generates a lot of heat,” said Ouda Salem, head of group for power-to-liquids at Fraunhofer ISE, yesterday. “We need to look closer in the reactor at relevant scale to develop the suitable technological solutions for PtX [power-to-X] new-boundary conditions.” A fiber-optic measurement system and a multi-position-valve sampling set-up, in conjunction with a dynamic Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), are used to measure concentration profiles and monitor axial temperature profile. The researchers say the new tool is based on a profile reactor that enables the dynamic measurement of concentration and temperature profiles. “By coupling axial sampling points with dynamic FTIR analytics, the product composition can be analyzed at seven positions across the length of the reactor,” the academics stated. “Besides kinetic measurement, Kiss is also suitable for long-term measurements and measurements involving components that could potentially damage the catalyst and inhibit the reaction.” The test stand is being used to investigate ammonia synthesis in a power-to-X process.

German vice-chancellor Robert Habeck visited the United Arab Emirates yesterday, where his ministry announced four hydrogen cooperation agreements and a research arrangement between the Fraunhofer Institute and the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Energy. “The UAE … wants to enable the first hydrogen deliveries to Germany in 2022,” read a press release. As part of its decarbonization strategy, Germany aims to generate up to 3 million tons of clean hydrogen demand this decade with imports to make up a large part of supplies of the gas. The agreements signed in the UAE include a partnership for a joint hydrogen transport demonstration project signed by German liquid organic hydrogen transport company Hydrogenious; the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc), the Americas division of the Jera joint vehicle established by Japanese energy company Chubu Electric Power and state-controlled peer Tepco; and the Finnish state-owned Uniper energy company headquartered in Düsseldorf.
German copper producer Aurubis, utility RWE and municipal energy company Steag – plus another entity called Gewec – signed a deal to buy blue ammonia – powered by natural gas and with its carbon emissions captured – produced by Adnoc, and the Emirati energy company also signed a co-operation agreement related to hydrogen transport with publicly-owned port logistics business Hamburger Hafen & Logistik AG. Those agreements are based on the “blue” hydrogen-related supplies making way for the renewables-powered “green” form of the energy carrier over time.
Angolan state-owned energy business Sonangol is carrying out studies to identify a site for a factory to produce green hydrogen and its derivatives. “The initiative is part of the company's energy transition strategy in the search for renewable energy resources, developed in partnership with the German companies Conjuncta GmbH and Gauff GmbH & Co. Engineering Kg who signed, among themselves, an agreement for the implementation of a plant for the production of green hydrogen in Angola,” the company wrote last week. 
British oilfield services company Petrofac has secured its first new-energy project in Egypt with local business Mediterranean Energy Partners. “The project is an early-stage study assessing the feasibility of a new green-hydrogen-to-ammonia facility that will target the production of 125,000 tons of green ammonia [per] year for export, using a mix of solar and wind energy,” Petrofac wrote last week. “Petrofac's scope will be key to successfully delivering the project and includes sizing the electrolyzers and the feasibility of export facilities at Ain Sokhna Port, on the Gulf of Suez.” Norwegian renewables developer Scatec this month signed a memorandum of understanding with Egyptian authorities to jointly develop a green ammonia facility at the port.
Perth-based Frontier Energy has started a renewable energy expansion study at its Bristol Springs Solar Project in Western Australia, to assess whether to increase power generation capacity beyond 500MWdc. The study will focus on the optimization of solar production, wind energy, and battery storage. “These studies will be led by experienced consultancy Xodus Group, who will consider a range of clean energy scenarios as well as the potential for green hydrogen production,” said Frontier MD Mike Young, referring to the Scottish consultant. “With the Western Australian government's plans for green hydrogen to match LNG market share by 2030, having an early mover advantage in this sector is essential.”
The government of Queensland has announced construction of a renewable hydrogen plant to fuel heavy transport in Western Downs is expected to start within six months.

The Austrian federal government has approved, on Monday, an energy package that is intended to address the energy crisis triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The package includes an “energy independence investment offensive” which includes a budget of €250 million for the development of wind power and photovoltaic projects.
The local PV association – PV Austria – welcomed the new package while also stressing the importance of implementing the secondary legislation required by the Renewable Energy Act (EAG) introduced last summer.
“Thousands of projects are urgently waiting for an opportunity to be implemented,” the trade body stated. “We assume that, in view of the announcements, the EAG will now be completed more quickly and the projects can be implemented,” explains Herbert Paierl, CEO of PV Austria.
Shortly before the war in Ukraine broke out, PV Austria asked the federal government in Vienna to provide €144 million for new solar rebates, and €30 million for battery storage in 2022. This would mean doubling the funding volume planned for this year. However, the ordinances to get the funding off the ground are still in the parliamentary process and have not been passed and the 2022 rebate program should be launched in the coming weeks.
Austria has set itself the goal of completely converting electricity generation to renewable energies by 2030. According to PV Austria, around 11GW of installed photovoltaic capacity would be needed for this. However, Austria is still a long way from that. At the end of 2020, it exceeded the 2GW threshold. The current annual growth rate of 350 to 400MW is far from enough to reach 11GW by 2030.

Their modeling was applied to a simulated 10MW solar plant at a fishery located in Yangzhong, in China's northern province of Jiangsu. The south-oriented solar plant is split into four units with a surface ranging from 2.3 to 3.6ha and built with polycrystalline modules that are placed on bracket bases on buried concrete columns, with a distance of six meters between each module row. The modules were installed with a tilt angle of 34.6 degrees and the lower edge sited 1.6m above the water surface.
Two 11m meteorological towers were used to take measurements of the local surface climate. “Each observation tower was equipped with a radiation system, an eddy covariance (EC) system, and three compact weather stations placed at different heights on the meteorological towers,” the researchers specified. The EC method is used to calculate the site's covariance of fluctuations in the vertical wind velocity and in the physical quantity. Measurements were taken for temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, wind direction and precipitation. Furthermore, the research team measured the water temperature at three different depths, of 0.05m, 0.75m, and 1.5m.
Through this analysis, which compared the impact of the PV plant site with that of a reference site with no solar array, the academics found that the fishery photovoltaic (FPV) plant had an “unobvious” heating effect on the surrounding environment during the entire observational period and that it also affected the wind speed and direction. “With the wind flowing through the FPV array, the tilted FPV panel resists the wind speed and changes the flowing air direction in the FPV site, relative to the reference site, to redistribute the wind pattern,” they emphasized, noting that the percentage frequency of east wind in the solar site at two meters decreased by 25.3% compared with the reference site.
As for the air temperature, the PV site showed temperatures ranging between 11.1 and 10.7 degrees Celsius, and the reference site between 10.8 and 10.6 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, the surface water temperature in the PV site was found to be 0.11 degrees Celsius higher than that in the reference site. “However, the FPV array represents a shading effect for deeper water, at 50 and 150cm. Therefore, the FPV array has a limited range of heating effect on water temperature,” the scientists further explained, adding that water at the solar site also absorbed higher heat than in the reference site.
“The long-wave radiation increased after the PV site was installed, which indirectly confirmed the existence of the thermal effect of the PV power site on the lake surface,” said researcher Gao Xiaoqing. “However, the data showed that the FPV array still had a limited range of heating effect on water temperature.”
Their findings are in the study “Effects of fishery complementary photovoltaic power plant on near-surface meteorology and energy balance,” published in Renewable Energy. “This study provides data [support] for the development of FPV power sites in the lake surface, which will help to realize sustainable development of solar energy resources and carbon goals,” they concluded.

Zinc-ion, however, still has the potential for good energy storage performance out of cheap, abundant materials.
With this in mind, a group of researchers from the University of Bremen, in Germany, has evaluated which barriers are currently preventing aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) from becoming a mainstream storage technology for power grid applications. “In order to boost the commercialization of aqueous ZIBs as cheap and safe storage devices for the stationary grid, it is worth highlighting the challenges that remain yet to be addressed together with the adoption of good experimental practices needed to align the academic research efforts with the industrial working conditions envisaged by a practical application of this battery technology,” they explained.
According to the scientists, the two main challenges that must be addressed in future research are the increase of the specific energy of the full Zn-ion cell and the prevention of the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction occurring during the Zn electrodeposition step. Particular attention should be given to the cycling of the zinc (II) ion (Zn2+) contained within the Zn-based anode, with respect to its total mass and the development of novel cathode materials that can achieve an average discharge voltage of the cell of at least 1.2V.
“Moreover, research efforts should also address the optimization of the electrolyte composition (eg, additives), towards the development of future water-based electrolytes, with the aim to hinder the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction at the anode,” they went on to say, adding that electrochemical tests should be standardized and experimental data should always be averaged over at least three different measurements.
The research group is currently working on novel zinc-based anodes, low-cost environmentally-friendly cathode materials, and the optimization of water-based electrolytes. Its findings were presented in the commentary article “Open challenges and good experimental practices in the research field of aqueous Zn-ion batteries,” which was recently published in nature communications.

The appetite for solar investment in Romania has not diminished, however, according to local experts who told pv magazine the supply chain has not yet suffered the ramifications of the war over the nation's border.
“I do not think that there is a setback for materials used in the PV industry for the moment in Romania but this is also because there are limited installments,” said Andrei Covatariu, of solar power components shipments. Covatariu, co-founder of sustainability practitioner network Ecera added: “Apart from service providers, which have already some stock, there is not much demand for utility scale PV, at least for now.”
Covatariu told pv magazine the Port of Constanța continues to operate normally, and “even at increased capacity,” with no significant disruption of PV shipments.
The latest edition of pv magazine investigates the rapid rise of TOPCon cell manufacturing. While not the only option PV manufacturers have their eye on, TOPCon is already the first n-type cell to claim significant market share. We chart the tech’s progress from laboratory to gigawatt production, plus efforts to standardize process flows, reduce costs, and raise performance.
As things stand, Romania benefits from its EU and Nato membership. A protracted military confrontation in Ukraine, and a potential escalation are likely to have consequences, however, and not necessarily linear ones. Such a situation could increase the importance of the local PV sector while also complicating logistics. 
Mihai Balan, executive director of the Romanian Photovoltaic Industry Association (RPIA), agrees. He said the war in Ukraine is, for now, a manageable shock. 
“The Romanian authorities and the country's allies reassured everybody that we are benefiting from the highest guarantees of security,” Balan told pv magazine.
While such “tranquility” cannot be taken for granted, supply chain issues may also hinder the country’s renewables potential in the medium term, especially for utility scale installations, further complicating expected growth in the PV sector. 
The solution envisaged – an increase in manufacturing capacity for crucial components – requires investment, a change in regulation, raw materials, and an increased focus on training PV technicians. While funds may not be a problem, those other pre-requisites are not straightforward to address.
“There is almost a monopoly for processing and raw materials,” said Covatariu. “If the geopolitical tensions increase, there might be even a worse shortage. That would have an impact on costs.”
The sustainability professional said tension in the market could increase if Russia and China clinch a raw materials and rare earths partnership.
Another concern is that the energy-intensive nature of solar component manufacturing could prove problematic in the light of surging electricity costs.
Conservative policies in the energy sector could derail Romanian attempts to increase renewable electricity production and increase dependence on Russian gas, with around 10-20% of the fuel consumed in the country supplied by the aggressor in Ukraine. 
“Investors' confidence has been impaired by the governmental measures that introduced a clawback mechanism for renewable electricity priced over €90/MWh, and the possibility to suspend the green certificate scheme this year,” said the RPIA's Balan.
With clean power industry commentators warning Romania should urgently review its land use and storage capacity rules, Balan said: “Ultimately, what should change to accelerate RES [renewable energy sources] investments is the perception authorities, both local and central have towards renewables. All the calls for projects should be transparent and competition-driven.”
The electricity network is another problem. The country has flexibility issues at grid level. “There are regions with renewable capacity that cannot accommodate more big scale capacity,” said Covatariu. “We need investments in the grid.”
Helpfully, the EU’s Modernisation Fund is pouring around €16 billion into the Romanian energy sector.
“Recently, the authorities announced €500 million worth of projects for the TSO [electricity transmission system operator] from the Modernisation Fund: it is great news for RES developments but these projects are expected to be completed later in the decade,” said Balan. “Also, from our calculations, the TSO's TYNDP [ten-year network development plan] does not keep up with the necessary investments in new RES capacities to meet Romania's climate targets and ensure its energy security.” More ambitious plans will be needed, he added.
Romania also needs more renewables technician training centers, beyond existing facilities at Constanța and the coal region of Petroșani.
“To increase investments in the PV sectors, it is crucial to educate more installers, technicians, engineers and project developers,” said Balan, adding EU funding could help expand the capacity of existing centers. 
Lack of trained photovoltaics personnel is a European issue. Recently, for instance, German companies scoured Romania for installers only to be rebuffed because of local shortages.
“A European training system would be a great initiative for addressing the workforce deficit that will only expand once RES developments are accelerated,” said Balan. “Regional centers that share the same curricula and prepare specialists qualified for working all across Europe might represent a solution.”
Trade body SolarPower Europe has predicted Romania will be Europe's sixth largest market in terms of PV sector job creation, with up to 54,000 full-time employees anticipated by 2025.
Romania is also mulling investment in solar manufacturing to reduce a reliance on Asian imports and sources have told pv magazine a small solar module fab is expected to open next year, and could scale up within a couple of years. As ever, of course, more investment would be helpful.
The European Commission has presented similar plans as it backs the development of a European battery supply chain and funds for solar manufacturing on the continent are available.
“The RPIA and RWEA [the Romanian Wind Energy Association] have set-up the RESinvest initiative, aimed at developing a robust domestic renewable energy supply chain, for which Romania already has funding available through the National Recovery and Resilience Plan [NRRP] and the Modernisation Fund,” said Balan. 
The Romanian NRRP – drafted to secure a slice of the €750 billion made available by the EU to help member states recover from the Covid-19 pandemic – foresees the development of solar cell and panel value chains which will reach a total annual production capacity of at least 200MW in 2025.
“There is potential for more capacity and we are in talks with the authorities to find the right ways to develop the domestic value chain for clean energy technologies,” added Balan.
Romania's Security Council, led by President Klaus Werner Iohannis, appears to agree and this month clarified the country will need to step up renewables investment. The organization suggested the scale of solar manufacturing developed should be larger as PV is emerging as a key technology to reduce reliance on Russian gas.
Covatariu and Balan both expect to see around 300MW of Romania's first utility scale solar projects finalized this year and anticipate more significant plants in the years ahead.
The role of prosumers – who generate as well as consume electricity, via small scale systems – is also expected to be significant and Bucharest in December approved payments to the owners of solar arrays with a generation capacity of up to 200kW for excess energy they export to the grid, with payments guaranteed for the rest of the decade.
“For the moment we cannot provide precise figures but, in the next couple of years we can expect somewhere between 150 and 200MW to be installed annually, which hopefully will grow towards the end of the decade,” said Balan, indicating the first large scale utility projects, and prosumers can help avoid fossil fuel gas use in thermal power plants in the short term. “In the medium term, solar will play a key role in the electrification of industry, replacing fossil fuel gas use with green H2 [hydrogen]; and in the heating sector, in conjunction with the large scale deployment of heat pumps,” he added.
When the European Commission published its “Fit-for-55” ambition – referring to the aim of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions at least 55% this decade – it included Romania installing 5.5GW of solar generation capacity by 2030. That was before Russia invaded Ukraine, however.
With hurdles still to overcome to get a solar supply chain established in Romania, Covatariu said: “The main concern is the next winter, or the next two winters. There is a time lag between making a decision; sourcing material; ramping up production, distribution, installation, and testing. The manufacturing capacity in Europe will take time.”

It is estimated solar installations may cover more than 3 million acres of the United States over the next decade, opening the door for PV to be paired with agricultural land to produce food, conserve ecosystems, and maximize income for farmers and growers. Decarbonizing food production, which accounts for as much as 30% of global emissions, makes agrivoltaics an environmental win-win.
A new solution for controlled-environment agriculture is set to be developed in a partnership between Heliene, a solar module manufacturer, and UbiQD, a photoluminescent materials integrator. The two seek to build a solution for greenhouses that transmits useful light for the plants inside and produces solar energy.
UbiQD builds translucent panels for greenhouses that are integrated with photoluminescent particles that are efficient at converting light into a preferable wavelength. The UbiQD “UbiGro” panels glow a spectrum of color that is optimized for plant growth, absorbing UV and blue light and emitting fruitful orange or red light.
In recent trials, UbiGro led to a 21% boost in flowering in geranium flowers, a 14-28% boost in winter strawberry growth, and an 8% yield increase in cannabis production. Increased crop yields are a welcome sign to any grower, and the two companies are set to take that benefit one step further, integrating productive solar PV in the greenhouse-topping modules.
The practice of co-locating solar energy production with food growth has been dubbed by many as “agrivoltaics.” The emerging sector taps into the benefits of localizing energy and preserving land use. In greenhouse agrivoltaics, there is a tradeoff between the transparency of the roofing and the electrical production. Herein lies the motivation to add yield boosting photoluminescence to the product.
“As energy costs continue to rise, the controlled environment agriculture industry will have to utilize energy sources more efficiently,” said Martin Pochtaruk, CEO of Heliene. “Greenhouses and photovoltaics generate hundreds of billions of dollars of value from sunlight, and our plan is that with our agrivoltaic modules, the whole will be greater than the sum of the parts.”
UbiQD has been developing electricity-generating windows alongside the photoluminescent light-optimizing UbiGro product. Now, with the participation of a major North American solar PV manufacturer in Heliene, the two can continue to develop and scale the photovoltaic element of the product.
Research by Oregon State University found that solar and agricultural co-location, including both indoor and outdoor uses, could provide 20% of the total electricity generation in the United States. Wide-scale installation of agrivoltaics could lead to an annual reduction of 330,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions while “minimally” impacting crop yield, the researchers said.
The Oregon State paper found that an area about the size of Maryland would be needed if agrivoltaics were to meet 20% of US electricity generation. That’s about 13,000 square miles, or 1% of current U.S. farmland.

Queensland-based zinc-bromine flow battery maker Redflow announced on Wednesday it had signed a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) with Anaergia subsidiary SoCal Biomenthane to collaborate on the installation of a fully wrapped solar and 5.5-6.0MWh battery storage solution at its biomethane plant in California.
Under the terms of the agreement, Redflow has a first right of refusal to supply approximately 5.5–6.0 MWh of batteries to be installed at SoCal Biomenthane’s Victor Valley bioenergy plant which converts food waste and wastewater into natural gas.
Redflow said the new solar and storage project is designed to lower the plant’s energy costs over the life of the system and reduce the carbon footprint of its industrial processes.
The project, which is targeted to be completed in the first half of 2023, comes after Redflow recently completed a 2MWh battery installation at Anaergia’s Rialto Bioenergy Facility in California.
Redflow chief executive officer Tim Harris said the Rialto energy storage solution, comprising 12 of the company’s 160kWh ‘Energy Pods’, was its largest installation to date but the new project is set to overshadow it, providing renewed exposure to the considerable US market.
“Having identified the US market as a key growth market for Redflow, it is terrific to see our profile in the US continuing to build,” he said.
“We are developing a track record of executing on projects in the US, where there is a strong underlying demand for energy storage to meet carbon footprint targets, including non-lithium solutions.
“If it proceeds, at up to 6MWh, the Victor Valley Project will be our largest deployment to date, involving the supply of up to 600 Generation 3 batteries.”

Redflow said its batteries – which earlier this month were selected by US non-profit standards development organization Underwriters Laboratories to be tested as part of a study into the key technical attributes of redox flow batteries – are designed for high cycle-rate, long time-base stationary energy storage applications, and are scalable from small systems through to grid-scale deployments.
Harris said the company’s batteries offer unique advantages including secure remote management, 100% daily depth of discharge, tolerance of high ambient temperatures, and sustained energy delivery throughout their operating life.
“Our deployment for Anaergia’s Rialto bioenergy facility demonstrated that our zinc-flow battery energy storage solutions were ideal for meeting the needs of US commercial and industrial customers as our batteries can thrive under tough conditions for extended durations,” he said.
“Redflow is uniquely placed to be at the forefront of energy storage as large commercial and industrial companies look to execute on their renewable energy strategies.”
Harris said under the terms of the LOI, Redflow will assist in the selection of a project constructor by providing technical support on integrating its zinc-bromine flow battery technology into the solar and storage solution and refining the project scope to meet SoCal Biomenthane’s requirements.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/22/upgrading-us-transmission-lines-could-enable-27gw-more-renewable-power-per-year/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MARCH 22, 2022",Upgrading US transmission lines could enable 27GW more renewable power per year,"From pv magazine USA
Replacing 5,000 miles of transmission wires each year with “advanced conductors” would make room for 27GW more renewable generation per year, says a report from Grid Strategies, published by the renewables trade group ACORE.
That projection is based on the increased capacity of advanced conductors, which “can have a maximum current-carrying capacity of up to two times that of conventional conductors,” says a Department of Energy report describing five types of advanced overhead conductors.
The increased capacity is partly due to an increase in the amount of aluminum in the wire, with one type of advanced conductor having about 28% more aluminum in the same diameter of wire as conventional conductors, says ACORE’s report. Aluminum is used for transmission because it is a good conductor of electricity that is much lighter than copper.
Advanced conductors also have a high-strength core with low thermal expansion. So if a parallel line fails, says a Department of Energy post, a line using an advanced conductor “can handle the extra current flow. When operated at higher temperatures (representing higher current flow), a normal conductor would tend to thermally expand and sag beyond safe limits—potentially grounding out to adjacent lines or structures—causing catastrophic outage. The advanced conductor’s reduced coefficient of thermal expansion prevents thermally induced line sag and would prevent that type of occurrence.”
Advanced conductors cost more than conventional conductors. Still, at least “one major utility is in the process of making advanced conductors their default, because they realize the value proposition,” said Jay Caspary with Grid Strategies, a co-author of the ACORE report, in a webinar. The US needs to “take full advantage” of existing transmission structures and rights of way by upgrading conventional transmission lines to higher-capacity advanced conductors, he said.
Worldwide, one type of advanced conductor has been used in more than 750 projects, while another type has been used in more than 140 countries, said the DOE report.
The ACORE report derived the projection that advanced conductors could make room for 27 GW of renewables per year through a three-step calculation. Starting with one utility’s stated need to replace 30% of its transmission lines over the next ten years, due to their age, the 30% figure is extrapolated to the US grid, yielding an estimate that 200,000 miles of transmission lines nationwide will need to be replaced over the next ten years. Assuming that 25% will be replaced with advanced conductors yields 5,000 miles of replacements per year. Representing that amount as 100 50-mile replacements per year, each “capable of providing an additional 200MW of capacity,” yields 20GW of additional renewable capacity on an AC basis. That is converted to 27GW on a DC basis, “assuming a 40% overbuild of wind capacity and a 30% overbuild of solar capacity.”
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has launched a reform process to “build the transmission system of the future.” Advanced conductors are within the scope of this proceeding, said Barbara Tyran of ACORE, during the webinar.
The ACORE report made policy recommendations regarding advanced conductors for FERC, the Department of Energy, transmission planners and owners, and state regulators. Those recommendations address several barriers to the adoption of advanced conductors, in terms of technical barriers, regulatory incentives and business practices.
Other types of advanced transmission technologies that can deliver more solar and wind to the grid include advanced power flow control, topology optimization and dynamic line ratings.
