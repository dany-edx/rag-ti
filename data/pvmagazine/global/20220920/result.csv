The purchase price will be negotiated on a monthly basis.
A consortium formed by Golden Solar (Hong Kong) Solar Material Company Limited, Giastar Group, and New Hosun Group has unveiled a plan to build a 10 GW heterojunction (HTJ) solar module factory in the Sichuan Province. The three companies want to invest CNY7 billion (around $1 billion) in the new facility.
Module maker Risen Energy is seeking to raise CNY5 billion through a private placement of shares. The company said the net proceeds will be partly invested in its project to build a 5 GW heterojunction module factory.
Highways business Shandong Hi-Speed this week agreed to work with the renewable and clean heat business it controls – Shandong Hi-Speed New Energy Group – to roll out clean power sites across its roads network and service stations. The renewables unit this week announced it generated 289 GWh of solar power in July, and 267 GWh in August for an eight-month total of 2.03 TWh to the end of August.
Polysilicon company GCL Technology has signed up for another 25,000 tons of coal from Suzhou GCL Energy Technology Co Ltd, at a maximum price of CNY 27.8 million ($3.97 million). The poly maker had already agreed to spend up to CNY 48.2 million on 43,230 tons from the same supplier under three agreements signed since June 4, 2022.
State-owned manufacturer Luoyang Glass last week paid Dutch-owned float glass maker TG Donghai CNY 422 million for its TG Fujian Photovoltaic Glass Co Ltd unit. TG Fujian also assembles systems for electric vehicles and makes batteries. Luoyang also started work last week on the CNY 2.3 billion first phase of a solar cell glass production fab whose two 1,200-ton-per-day lines will be able to manufacture 137 million m2 of cell glass per year upon completion. This week, the company started production at a separate PV cell fab in Hefei which Luoyang said features “the first intelligent warehouse in the industry.” The manufacturer also fired up a carbon capture and utilization system in Hefei it says will produce 50,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually.
A solar project company and a clean power business accounted for CNY5.7 million of the CNY 12.8 million solar developer Kong Sun Holding put aside for bad debts related to its financial services arm during the first half. Publishing its six-month figures last week, Kong Sun said both unnamed companies were still operating normally and legal recovery of the overdue loans, of CNY 2.8 million and CNY 2.9 million, respectively, was being considered. Kong Sun, which retains 14 solar plants with 390 MW of generation capacity reported a first-half loss of CNY 89.5 million, down from CNY 153 million in the same period of last year. Sales of its solar projects meant the CNY 564 million of revenue Kong Sun posted in January to June last year fell to CNY 285 million this time, with the first-half numbers not helped by CNY 10.8 million of “solar plant rectification expenses.”

The Sur-Andévalo Irrigation Community in Spain's southern province of Huelva has completed the installation of a 1.6 MW floating photovoltaic plant for solar pumping.
Built on the Dehesa de las Yeguas pond, in the municipality of Cartaya, the system relies on 7,168 Isifloating 4.0 floats provided by Spanish specialist Isigenere and 3,584 solar panels, each with a rated power of 450 W.
Access to the floating platform consists of three footbridges reinforced with metal profiles and safety rails. “These gateways allow access to the platform to carry out its maintenance, and, in addition, support the evacuation of the electrical system with all the necessary stability and security,” the company explained.
The solar energy produced by the plant will help reducing the energy costs of the irrigation community's water pumping. In addition, the floating solar plant will help reduce water evaporation and algae blooms. The project included the participation of Cian Obras y Servicios S.L., which was in charge of the floating structure installation, anchors, moorings and the electrical system; and Papola Ingenieros S.L.P.U., which oversaw engineering.
Isifloating features a unique and patented floating technology that allows partial or complete coverage of the water surface, according to Isigenere. Floating solar plants can be placed on top of multiple bodies of water: irrigation ponds, industrial use ponds, reservoirs, hydroelectric plants, water treatment plants, mine lakes or even on land susceptible to flooding. “The current version of the Isifloating 4.0 system is the most durable, safest, easiest to transport, simple to install, weatherproof and lowest O&M system on the market,” the company stated.
In March, the Spanish government submitted to public consultation a royal decree that would regulate the installation of floating photovoltaic plants. According to its estimates, around 7.5 GW of floating photovoltaic capacity could be deployed in public domain waters.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/20/cambodias-steeplechase-towards-renewable-energy/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,ASIA,CAMBODIA",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2022",Cambodia’s steeplechase towards renewable energy,"Installation of rooftop PV is heavily penalized in Cambodia with solar arrays currently charged a monthly capacity fee – around US$0.07/kWh for larger systems and $0.84/kWh for smaller systems, according to the report “Position paper on renewable energy in Cambodia” by the European Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia (EuroChamb). It is advocating for the cancelation of the charges for both the manufacturing and industrial sectors.
According to the regulations introduced by the Electricity Authority of Cambodia (EAC) in 2018, rooftop PV system owners cannot access cheaper off-peak energy at nighttime nor may they export excess solar electricity to the grid. Furthermore, solar is capped at 50% of the contracted load, and systems built prior to the regulations cannot operate.
“It is evident that this tariff and regulation policy is not only discouraging investments in private solar panels but effectively blocking any possibility for the industry to reduce the cost of electricity and achieve sustainability goals,” Massimiliano Tropeano, sustainability and garment expert at EuroChamb Cambodia told pv magazine. Cambodia currently has one of the highest electricity prices in Asia, with industrial, agricultural, and commercial consumers paying between $0.1370 to $0.1723/kWh.
The Cambodian government has rolled out policies to lower the price of electricity and attract foreign investment. It is reportedly considering halving the capacity charge for rooftop PV systems. “We know the government might reduce the capacity charge levied on the solar PV systems, also thanks to the various messages coming from the industry and us. Nevertheless, even a slash of 50% – rumors are saying so – will not be sufficient to open a substantial solar market that could be advantageous for everyone,” Tropeano said.
Other policies comprise the approval last year of a law that includes tax and custom duties exemptions for renewable energy. Solar panels are currently exempt from import tax, but there is a 5% duty on PV inverters purchased from China, and 7% from elsewhere.
Cambodia’s economy is still mostly driven by the garment manufacturing sector. The current regulations frustrate rooftop PV’s potential to offer lower electricity bills, making it unattractive for most factories. “All the factories have an investment perspective of maximum five years. The solar systems proposed to them at this point have an unattractive return on investment (ROI) of eight to 10 years,” said Tropeano. “Even if the capacity charge is slashed by 50%, the ROI will be oscillating between six to eight years – still unappealing and not enough for a garment factory.”
Another regulation currently preventing the expansion of the Cambodian PV market is the unavailability of bilateral power purchase agreements (PPAs). The state-owned utility Electricite du Cambodge (EDC) is the only authorized entity to sign PPAs for solar power, thus prohibiting renewable energy licensees and special economic zones from installing solar power. According to EDC, the Cambodian grid cannot sustain variable solar power output, thereby limiting the amount of solar on the grid to 15% of the electricity generation mix.
Overall, solar accounted for 6.36% of Cambodia’s energy mix in 2021, according to data from the EDC. The country’s total installed capacity totaled 376.8 MW in 2021. In 2020, there were 296.80 MW of solar installed, representing 3.38% of the energy mix.
Solar is the only renewable energy source predicted to grow in the country in 2022, to 436.80 MW of installed capacity, corresponding to 6.77% of the energy mix. Hydro is the largest source of renewable energy in the country, with 1,331.70 MW of installed capacity in 2021, or 44,17% of the energy mix.
Cambodia imported 26.55% of its energy mix in 2021, with 56.91% coming from Laos, 33.95% from Vietnam, and 9.14% from Thailand. Figures are expected to increase in 2022, with the country importing 31.79% of its energy mix. Imports from Laos and Thailand will grow, totaling 62.45% and 10.47% of imported energy, respectively, with imports from Vietnam decreasing to 27.08%.
According to a recent report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), there is an estimated $903 million investment opportunity in solar PV in Cambodia.

Solarever, a Mexican solar module manufacturer, announced this week it intends to invest $1 billion in the construction of its second solar panel factory in Zacoalco de Torres, in the state of Jalisco.
The new manufacturing facility is expected to produce both cells and modules and to cover a surface of around 1,000 m2.
“Investing in this type of project is essential and Jalisco is a state with great potential in the sector and skilled labor, which is why it has had impressive growth,” Eversolar CEO Simon Zhao said. “For this reason, we want to continue promoting clean energy in this entity for all of Mexico.”
In May, Solarever had also unveiled plans to increase its production capacity from 500 MW to 1 GW at its factory in Tecomán, in southwestern Mexico. “We are also planning to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and to expand our business in the EV and storage business,” Zhao told pv magazine at the time.
The company recently signed agreements with the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and the Autonomous Metropolitan University to build an R&D center for the development of solar, EV and storage technologies.
In a separate development, Brazilian PV system provider Sengi Solar announced an investment of BRL 440 million ($85 million) for the construction of two solar panel factories in the states of Paraná and Pernambuco.
The two facilities are to have a combined capacity of 1 GW. The investments are expected to generate about 500 direct jobs in the two regions, one of them at the headquarters in Cascavel, Paraná, scheduled to start operating in September this year, and at the Pernambuco branch in Ipojuca, with launch scheduled for March 2023.
The modules produced at the facilities will have a rated power of between 440 and 670 W and will be manufactured with bifacial and double glass technologies.
According to Everton Fardin, managing director of Sengi Solar, the plan is to fully meet the growth of the domestic solar energy market and offer a Brazilian product to more than 80 photovoltaic equipment distributors operating in the country, with short delivery times, national after-sales, and state-of-the-art technology.
Sengi Solar is a subsidiary of the Tangipar Group, which offers vertical solutions for the entire energy chain, from manufacturing and distribution to installation. With around 800 employees distributed between headquarters and distribution centers, the organization operates in the energy segment with distributed and centralized generation and commercialization as well as supply and distribution of photovoltaic equipment.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/20/hydrogen-to-play-limited-role-in-building-energy-supply/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,GERMANY",MARIAN WILLUHN,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2022",Hydrogen to play limited role in building energy supply,"From pv magazine Germany
A global energy turnaround without hydrogen is unthinkable. The cost and efficiency of hydrogen make alternatives appear more attractive in many sectors. In the building sector, for example, hydrogen will in principle not be used.
That is the verdict of a study that originated from the HyPat joint project. The Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research ISI, along with other institutes, including the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE and the German Energy Agency (Dena), examined 40 recently published studies on energy systems and hydrogen scenarios and used 300 reduction scenarios from the sixth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to determine a range of global hydrogen demand.
According to their forecasts, a scenario in which the greenhouse gas reduction is more than 80 percent by 2050 will require between 4 and 15 petawatt hours of hydrogen and synthesis products such as ammonia and methanol. One petawatt hour is equal to 1 million gigawatt hours.
Calculated on the basis of global final energy demand, that is 4 to 12%. The consumption of hydrogen is subject to strong regional differences. In relative terms, the EU will become the main consumer of hydrogen. The study calculates that up to 14% of the final energy requirement could be covered by hydrogen. In China, the authors assume a share of up to 4% in final energy consumption.
Calculated in absolute numbers, however, the relationship looks different. The major share of the EU will only lead to a consumption of 0.3 to 1 petawatt hour per year. In China, the demand will be between 0.6 and 4 petawatt hours per year.
“Our evaluations underline that hydrogen will play an important role in future global climate policy — but it will not be the dominant final energy source in the future,” says Martin Wietschel, professor at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and head of the Competence Center for Energy Technologies and Energy Systems at Fraunhofer ISI. “In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally, measures to save energy and direct electrification based on renewable electricity, such as through heat pumps, electric vehicles or in heating networks, are seen as the most important levers. Hydrogen, on the other hand, plays a relevant role in certain application areas in which other technologies cannot be implemented technically or economically.”
Broken down by sector, mobility shows the highest demand in absolute figures as well as relative to total demand. The study assumes that by 2050 around 16% of global energy in the mobility sector will be covered by hydrogen and its synthetic products. The authors forecast a share of 14% for the Chinese market. The EU stands out in this sector with an expected share of 28%.
The use of hydrogen in road traffic offers short “charging times” and long ranges compared to electric cars. However, the overall efficiency of fuel cell vehicles leaves a lot to be desired at just 34%. That is nevertheless still well above the 14% efficiency of vehicles that are fueled with synthetic fuels. Electric cars achieve a value of 77% in this metric.
The use of hydrogen is more conceivable for heavy-duty transport, since the weight of the batteries becomes a problem in this area of application. In addition, the long loading times are not always compatible with the way logistics companies work. In any case, hydrogen and above all synthetic products will be used in air traffic and shipping.
These technical and logistical uncertainties sometimes lead to very large bandwidths in the hydrogen demand in the 40 studies examined for the mobility sector. As a result, investments in production, transport and consumers are still avoided. In Europe, the individual studies predicted a hydrogen share of 13 to 36%. For China it was between 10% and 19%.
Compared to the mobility sector, lower demand is forecast for the industrial sector. However, unlike in mobility, there are often no alternatives here. Especially in the iron and steel industry, as well as in basic chemistry, it will not work without hydrogen, ammonia and methanol.
However, this does not apply to all areas of industry. When it comes to the provision of heat, for example, there are even greater uncertainties. This is mainly due to the available alternatives. According to the study, by 2050 hydrogen will account for between 2 and 9% of the world's total energy requirements in the industry. Here, too, there are strong regional differences. The majority of the studies examined expects a share of 3 to 16% for Europe in 2050. Individual studies even forecast a share of 38%. In China, on the other hand, the proportion will only be between 1 and 4% in 2050.
The more alternatives there are to hydrogen, the lower its use. This applies in particular to the building sector. According to the study, the share of building energy consumption in 2050 is likely to be less than 2%. Up to 1.7% is expected in the EU. Globally, the share is likely to be 1.6%. In China, only 0.5% of building energy requirements are probably covered by hydrogen.
The low use of hydrogen in the building sector is due to the other ways to save emissions, such as direct electrification with heat pumps and infrared heating. Alternatives are also significantly more efficient than fuel cell heaters, which are only 57% efficient. Even heating systems that burn compressed hydrogen directly for heat use only achieve an efficiency of 64%. Electric instantaneous water heaters, on the other hand, achieve 95%. The authors of the study assumed an efficiency of 300% for heat pumps.

Loop Energy uses a trapezoid plate with narrowing channels for its bipolar plates, which reportedly increases gas velocity down the plate to deliver higher fuel efficiency and power output. The company believes this new product allows fuel cost parity with diesel up to eight years earlier than previously considered possible.
French train manufacturer Alstom has demonstrated the effectiveness of its hydrogen-powered solutions for long-distance transportation. “During a long-distance journey, an unmodified serially-produced Coradia iLint train covered 1,175 kilometers without refueling the hydrogen tank,” the company said. The train departed in Lower Saxony, in northern Germany, and arrived in Munich, in the southern part of the country.
Governments and companies should coordinate to increase commitments for the use of low carbon and renewable hydrogen while agreeing on certification schemes focused on emissions, safety, and operational issues such as leakage. This is one of the main conclusions of the “Breakthrough Agenda Report 2022” published by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Purchase commitments should support investments in production, which must scale from less than 1 Mt in 2020 to around 140-155 Mt per year by 2030. “Hydrogen deployment consistent with a 1.5C-aligned pathway will require an annual investment of around $60-130 billion through to 2030, relative to the less than $1 billion invested annually, on average, over the last decade,” reads the paper. The IEA also stresses the importance of low-carbon infrastructures, making a case for hydrogen gas pipelines. 
Morocco's research institute IRESEN has installed a photovoltaic powered 20 kW hydrogen production system. The project is part of its “Power-to-X µPilot” initiative and is aimed at testing the electrolyzer under a variable renewable electricity load. Developed with Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P), the project is incubated at the heart of the Green Energy Park in Ben Guerir, Morocco. It aims to integrate technologies and innovations emerging from the value chain of the green hydrogen sector.
The Port of Rotterdam Authority has awarded the contract for constructing a new hydrogen and CO2 pipeline along the Europoort to Swietelsky Rail Benelux. “The new pipeline strip will be 7.60 meters wide, creating space for six or seven cables and pipes. The project is scheduled for completion at the end of 2023,” the authority said.
Ireland’s first green hydrogen company, EIH2, the Port of Cork, and the Port of Amsterdam signed a memorandum of understanding to use Irish offshore wind for green hydrogen production. The deal should establish a supply chain between Ireland and Europe via the port of Amsterdam.
TECO 2030 has launched a new product concept for its containerized fuel cells. “The solution comprises TECO 2030 fuel cell modules, batteries, power electronics, safety- and automation systems, hydrogen storage, and a refueling solution. The concept forms a scalable multimegawatt solution for electricity production for shore power from hydrogen,” said the Norwegian company.

Renewable energy developer Q Energy France and aquaponics specialist Aquacosy have unveiled a pilot PV system linked to hydroponic cultivation in the town of Montauban in the French department of Tarn et Garonne.
Hydroponic farms grow crops that do not use soil and utilize mineral nutrient solutions in an aqueous solvent, usually in greenhouses or closed spaces. They consist of an above-ground cultivation system in which the plants develop with their roots in water enriched with natural and bio-sourced nutrients with the use of biological control.
The hydroponic farm has an area or around 250 m² and is connected to a PV system with an installed power of 9.3 kW equipped with a hydraulic system with two rainwater recovery gutters. Thus, the rainwater that flows over the panels is collected in a basin, thus allowing continuous irrigation of the plantations thanks to its closed circuit water pump system in order to preserve water resources.
The system, comprising hygrometry sensors, sondes and a pump, is entirely powered by solar energy and was designed according to a protocol approved by the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS).
“The prototype presents very encouraging initial results both in terms of yield of agricultural production and lengthening of production seasons thanks, in particular, to strong protection against wind and frost,” the companies said in a joint statement. “In addition, it can be installed anywhere, preferably on land with very low agronomic value. It has no negative impact on the environment, and makes it possible to grow 100% natural, diversified and dense production in five to 15 times less space.”
For the next step, the partners are looking for land for a larger project, and hope to demonstrate these same benefits for agricultural production. “This is an ideal tool for territories wishing to set up short food and energy circuits while promoting the creation of agricultural jobs,” said Céline Spitzhorn, solar director of Q Energy France.
A Chinese-Qatari research group recently assessed the potential of integrating PV power generation with hydroponic farms in greenhouses or closed spaces. The scientists investigated, in particular, how a multi-period, electricity-intensive hydroponic crop production system may be coupled to a PV system under different incentive policies, such as feed-in tariff (FIT) programs, rebate schemes, net metering and improving electricity tariff (IET) mechanisms, which consist of simply raising electricity prices for consumers or reducing existing subsidies.

Todd Generation, through subsidiary Nova Energy, plans to build what would be New Zealand’s largest solar farm on a 1,022-hectare dairy farm on the North Island but first the developer must clear a final hurdle.
After lodging land-use consents with the Taupō District Council and the Bay of Plenty Regional Council earlier this year seeking permission to convert the farmland into a solar facility, Todd Generation will have its application heard by an independent resource consent commissioner on Wednesday.
Todd Generation said, subject to a final investment decision to be made after the consenting process, it plans to “break ground on the 150 MW stage 1 in 2023, with operations commencing approximately 18 months later”.
The ~$530 million (NZ$600 million) project would comprise approximately 900,000 solar panels arranged across the 1,022-hectare site at Rangitāiki, about 35 km southeast of Taupō. The company is also seeking approval to construct 98 centralized inverters, a switchyard, and transmission lines to connect the project to the national grid.
The Taupō solar farm is to be built in stages with all three phases expected to be completed and the facility fully operational by the last quarter of 2027.
Todd Generation said when complete, the project will generate about 650,000 MWh of clean energy per annum, contributing an approximate 1% increase to New Zealand’s renewable electricity generation capacity, enough to satisfy the electricity demands of approximately 100,000 homes. “The Rangitāiki solar power plant represents a significant investment in New Zealand’s future renewable energy supply,” the company said.
Todd Generation projects and developments manager Christopher Pye said the proposed Taupō project will provide a significant contribution to the development of large-scale solar capacity in New Zealand and provide diversification of the country’s renewable electricity portfolio. “Solar generation of meaningful scale does not yet exist in New Zealand,” he said. “However deployment is well demonstrated overseas and decades of experience now exist within the sector. New Zealand is now well placed to develop and operate high-quality solar electricity generation assets, building on the 10-plus years of experience in nearby Australia in particular.”

While solar presently makes up less than 0.5% of electricity generation in New Zealand, the Climate Change Commission has estimated that the technology will need to grow to an estimated 19 GW and contribute 20% of electricity supply by 2050 for New Zealand to meet its net-zero carbon targets.
The Taupō project would be far and away the largest solar farm in New Zealand. It dwarfs the country’s largest existing solar farm, the 2.1 MW Kapuni plant in Taranaki, which is operated by Nova Energy and is more than double the capacity of a 150 MW farm being constructed at Christchurch Airport.
The Taupō project is one of a handful of utility scale solar farm projects in the pipeline across the country.
In April, Helios Energy, formed by a group of US and New Zealand entrepreneurs, announced it would pursue grid-scale solar developments in New Zealand.
That announcement was followed by New Zealand’s Contact Energy teaming with Lightsource bp, the renewables arm of Britain-based BP, to announce plans to develop a large-scale solar portfolio.
A month later German investment manager Aquila Capital partnered with Auckland-based renewables developer Far North Solar Farm (FNSF) to develop an estimated $1 billion suite of large-scale solar PV projects across New Zealand’s North and South islands.

“The discussed method currently identifies primarily ring dam type reservoirs in flat areas since one of the constraints is the area slope,” they explained. “Nevertheless, this might omit some possible sites where the construction of a dammed valley type structure is feasible, as these types of reservoirs will most likely not pass the slope and area size constraint.”
The novel methodology is based on an algorithm that considers primarily the area shapes and sizes of potential pumped hydro storage sites along rivers and shorelines, while also taking into account common parameters such as geological, topographical, and hydrological conditions, the availability of water bodies, transport infrastructure, power grid proximity, protected areas, nature reserves and heritage sites.
In addition, it considers parameters such as the minimum required flat area for the reservoir, the allowable slope of the terrain, the minimum head, and minimum required head to distance ratio between two reservoirs. “However, the algorithm is not restricted to line based lower reservoirs as rivers or shorelines,” the German group stated, noting that, compared to previous methods, the new methodology includes the shape criterion, which reportedly enables a better analysis of site with irregular shapes that could be unsuitable for ring dams, and applies multiple ground slope ranges.
The scientists applied the proposed method to the Maipo and Bio-Bio rivers in Chile to build a case study and said the two rivers both have sufficient discharge at roughly two thirds of their length to fulfill the minimum flow requirements for an upper reservoir. They identified some potential sites for pumped hydro storage stations close to the river on ridges while a few other sites are located at higher altitudes. “The proposed method was able to find flat suitable surfaces even at higher altitudes. Furthermore, all identified sites seem feasible from a topological point of view. Therefore, the overall efficiency of the proposed method is quite good given the low computational effort,” they further explained.
The German group presented its methodology in the study “Assessment of pumped hydropower energy storage potential along rivers and shorelines,” published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. “The proposed method generates high quality results with a low computational effort,” it concluded.
A group of researchers from Australia recently identified 616,818 locations throughout the world that could be suitable sites for 23.1 million GWh of closed-loop pumped-hydro storage capacity. The academics stated that “off-river” pumped-hydro projects are able to overcome the typical topographical issues of conventional pumped-hydro, as the size of reservoirs is relatively small, ranging from tens to hundreds of hectares. This limited size also reduces the need to manage large flood events and ensures considerably lower construction costs.

The researchers built the cell with a kesterite substrate known as CAZTS, a tin oxide (FTO) substrate, an electron transport layer (ETL) based on titanium oxide (TiO2), and a precursor film made of PTB7 polymer, molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) and gold (Au). “Refining of Ag in the absorber was realized during the precursor film construction where an additional layer of copper-free solution was coated on top of the pristine precursor,” they explained.
The research team tested the cell under standard illumination conditions and found it achieved a power conversion efficiency of 9.7%, which it described as a new record for this type of device. The cell was also able to retain around 90% of its initial efficiency after 100 days without encapsulation. The academics said silver refining resulted  in averagely doubled grain sizes, expanded depleted region width, and improved
transport kinetics, which in turn was responsible for increasing the cell's open-circuit voltage and fill factor.
“Estonian company Crystalsol Inc. recently fabricated flexible, light-weight, transparent, and low-cost solar modules,” Konstantatos said. “According to its report, the production cost of a kesterite module is around $0.35/W. Since kesterite only consists of earth-abundant elements, it does not have a fundamental limit to scale up to terawatt, rather than the scarcity of indium and gallium in copper, indium, gallium and selenium (CIGS) thin-film solar cells. In addition, given the current kesterite module efficiency is around 10%, which compares to about 20% for CIGS, further reduction of cost can be achieved with improved efficiency and mass production.”
They presented the device in the paper “Ag-Refined Kesterite in Superstrate Solar Cell Configuration with 9.7% Power Conversion Efficiency,” published in Advanced Functional Materials. “In this study, we introduced silver which is a rather expensive element, but with ultrathin absorber that is around 10 times thinner than conventional kesterite film, hence the resulting cost for material remained the same, which perseveres the low-cost advantage of pristine kesterite.”

US-based First Solar has signed an agreement to supply 600 MW (DC) of its thin-film PV modules to Indian developer Azure Power Global.
The deal is the first for modules produced at First Solar’s new manufacturing facility in India.  Under the terms of the agreement, First Solar should deliver its Series 7 modules between the fourth quarter of 2023 and the end of 2025.
“Having a long-term agreement with global solar modules technology leaders like First Solar is key to de-risking our supply side with the latest technology available in the market,” said Rupesh Agarwal, acting chief executive officer, Azure Power.
First Solar expects its Indian vertically integrated facility, located near Chennai in Tamil Nadu, to start production in the second half of 2023. The factory is planned to have an annual capacity of 3.3 GW and to produce an India-optimized version of the company’s Series 7 modules. 
“Our relationship with Azure Power goes back over a decade and we are pleased that it is the launch customer for a product that has not only been designed for India, but made in India, for India,” said Georges Antoun, chief commercial officer, First Solar.

In February 2021, US President Joe Biden issued an Executive Order calling for the establishment of resilient American supply chains intended to, in part, advance the fight against climate change. To achieve the current goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035, the US Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that solar energy would need to grow from 4% of electricity supply today to 40%.
This kind of growth will increase the demand for everything along the solar supply chain, from polysilicon through to modules. With both goals in parallel, the desire to foster a domestic supply chain and the necessity to ramp up renewables, the question begs: to what extent can the domestic US solar supply chain be expanded to meet clean energy goals?
China’s dominance
The solar supply chain has long been reliant on products from China, or from Chinese subsidiaries in Southeast Asia. As of 2021, China was responsible for manufacturing a dominant share of the solar supply chain, according to statistics from the US Department of Energy.
As a manufacturer, China has a mixed reputation in terms of its environmental and social credentials, as much of its electricity generation utilizes coal, and there have been credible accusations of human rights violations in a region where some solar manufacturing is located. Given this and various other trade disputes, the United States has also had an unpredictable and somewhat fraught trade relationship with China.
Securing a domestic supply chain to support the United States’ clean energy transition has become increasingly important since the start of the global energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. At the Sydney Energy Forum in July, US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm cautioned against “relying too much on one entity for our source of fuel.”
Granholm described the transition to renewables as “the greatest peace plan of all” because countries cannot be “held hostage” over access to the sun or wind. “They have not ever been weaponized, nor will they be,” she said.
Polysilicon problem
The solar industry is experiencing a critical shortage in polysilicon and prices have hit highs not seen since 2011, due in part to a major manufacturer in Xinjiang closing unexpectedly for repairs. The Xinjiang region in western China is the origin of nearly 50% of the world’s supply of polysilicon, and it is currently under scrutiny for allegations of forced labor.
The United States has domestic polysilicon production capacity; however, as of 2021 it was not being used for solar applications – but that may be changing. In March 2022, Hanwha Solutions announced that it was increasing efforts to supply customers with “Made-in-America” products.
Hanwha, the South Korean company that owns module maker Q Cells, launched this effort by becoming the largest shareholder REC Silicon, a major US-based manufacturer of polysilicon. Following its initial $160 million acquisition to take a 16.67% stake in REC Silicon in January 2022, Hanwha is acquiring an additional 4.67% stake from Aker Horizons in a deal valued at approximately $44 million. This investment will help American manufacturers secure the raw material critical to the solar supply chain.
While developments in polysilicon production are promising, crystalline silicon ingot, wafer, and cell production in the United States remains nonexistent. However, the United States is home to a small but growing number of solar module manufacturers.
Q Cells and JinkoSolar, both with manufacturing operations in China, have established operations in the United States. With its headquarters in Switzerland and production in Germany, Meyer Burger announced in December 2021 its intention to set up a module assembly facility in Goodyear, Arizona. Mission Solar, and Solaria are also crystalline silicon PV manufacturers that originated and operate in the United States. And Silfab produces modules in Washington and Toronto, Canada.
Racking, tracking
Mounting structures are composed mostly of heavy steel components, and while the steel is relatively inexpensive, shipping costs can make up a significant portion of the finished product. Therefore, it is most cost effective to source products near to where they will be used. Most of the leading racking companies in the US marketplace manufacture exclusively in the U.S. including Unirac, PV Racking, ProSolar, Quick Mount PV, Oatey, DPW Solar, and Tamarack Solar. IronRidge manufactures, in part, in the United States.
The two largest tracker vendors, both globally and in the United States, are the US firms Nextracker and Array Technologies – collectively representing 70% of 2020 U.S. tracker shipments, and 46% of 2020 global tracker shipments. Based in San Jose, California, Nextracker was originally a U.S. company, but was acquired in 2015 by Singapore-based Flex.
Power electronics
Inverters and power electronics are an example of where the global supply chain comes into play, as many components are typically manufactured in separate locations around the world. According to the DOE’s “Solar Photovoltaic Supply Chain Deep Dive Assessment,” published in February 2022, most of the European and Chinese companies manufacture domestically, but many inverter manufacturers produce products abroad, particularly those that manufacture module level-power electronics (MLPE).
Among MLPE producers, SolarEdge, headquartered in Israel, has production facilities in Hungary, China, and Vietnam. The second leading MLPE producer, Enphase, is headquartered in the United States, and has production facilities in China and Mexico.
Interestingly, the inverter supply chain varies by inverter type, with U.S. utility-scale inverters largely supplied by European and Japanese companies, and residential inverters coming from U.S. and a large number of other foreign countries.
More American-made
A recent Wood Mackenzie report estimated that with supportive policies, an additional 20 GW of US manufacturing could be added. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 was signed into law in August and is the most significant clean energy legislation in US history.
The IRA contains $370 billion in spending for renewable energy and climate measures, including over $60 billion for domestic manufacturing across the clean energy supply chain, which includes clean energy vehicles. The bill provides the support needed to achieve American manufacturing independence and clean energy security as we move toward a carbon-free future. 
Thin-film PV production
Cadmium tellurium (CdTe) thin-film PV technology was developed in the United States and makes up about 20% of the modules installed in the nation. CdTe has become the dominant source of modules in utility-scale projects, which make up 55% of total solar installs in the United States.
The US Department of Energy (DOE) recently launched the $20 million Cadmium Telluride Accelerator Consortium, which has a goal of making CdTe solar cells less expensive and more efficient, and to develop new markets for solar products.
First Solar is often touted as the lone US solar manufacturing success story, at least operating at gigawatt-scale. Founded in 1999, the company has had a manufacturing presence in Ohio since 2002 when it produced 1.5 MW of modules and employed 150 people. Since then, it has invested over $2 billion in expanding its Ohio manufacturing facilities.
In 2019 First Solar commissioned a second US factory, thus establishing itself as having one of the largest solar manufacturing footprints in the Western Hemisphere. Now a third factory is under construction. Representing an investment of $680 million, it will bring First Solar’s Ohio manufacturing capacity to 6 GW. The new “smart factory” will use artificial intelligence and Internet of Things connectivity, enabling the three-factory operation to have the capacity to produce on average one module roughly every 2.75 seconds.
Toledo Solar is another US manufacturer of CdTe modules. pv magazine USA spoke with founder, Aaron Bates, who noted several advantages to CdTe in the utility market beginning with that the degradation level is much lower than polysilicon modules. CdTe modules also perform better in high temperatures, and they’re highly recyclable. Bates credits First Solar for pioneering CdTe module recycling.
What’s in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 for US manufacturing?
