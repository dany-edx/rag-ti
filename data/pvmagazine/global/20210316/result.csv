The company said the factory will produce 21.5%-efficient modules with 182mm wafers and 10BB half‐cut cells and with power output ranging from 550 to 610 W. “The new production line will be fully automated, combining the known‐own of top brand Chinese machinery company, and French engineering, production and quality process, SOP, in order to build high-quality solar power modules,” the manufacturer stated.
Chinese monocrystalline module maker Longi announced an increase in prices for all its wafers for April. P-type G1 products with 158.75mm size will be priced at RMB3.65 ($4.3) per piece, and M6 products with (166mm) at RMB3.75. For both products, the price was raised by RMB0.1. The price of M10 wafers with large size was increased by 2.7% to RMB4.56 per piece. The price hike is likely due to rising polysilicon prices. Since February, the price of polysilicon has increased by over 20%. Recently, it exceeded RMB110 per kg.
Private electric equipment manufacturer, China Changgao Group, announced on Monday it has sold two renewable energy power plants totaling to State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC). The deal includes a 40 MW solar park located in the Shaanxi province.

Comtec, which endured a horrible year in 2019 and which last year decided to abandon solar manufacturing, yesterday insisted the legal dispute referred to by the Paris-based professional services membership group had been resolved “as at the date of this announcement.” It was notable that the update released yesterday referred to a decision by Mazars which became effective on Monday last week.
The legal dispute in question, added Comtec: “Was immaterial as it only involved a very insignificant amount of money … The board is of the view that there is no potential impact of the dispute on the group.” No further information was disclosed.
Comtec said it is searching for a new auditor and, in a classic example of boilerplate script, added: “The board would like to take this opportunity to express its gratitude to Mazars for their professional services rendered in the past.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/16/retrofitting-solar-parks-for-agrivoltaics/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,GREECE,ITALY,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 16, 2021",Retrofitting solar parks for agrivoltaics,"Enel Green Power, the renewable energy unit of multinational energy group Enel, has launched a series of agrivoltaic pilot projects at nine demonstration sites in Europe, including two in Greece, five in Spain, and two in Italy.
“Our initial approach to agrivoltaics is based on the idea of utilizing existing and operational solar parks,” Giovanni Tula, Enel Green Power's head of sustainability, told pv magazine. “We are trying to understand if different kinds of agricultural activities can be integrated in an efficient way into plants that have been active in the power generation business for several years.”
Its approach is designed to utilize agricultural surfaces that have already been used for the construction of large-scale solar plants, so there is no need to occupy new plots of land.

According to Tula, there is plenty of room for crops between the trackers and the panels. “A conventional solar park does not change the nature of the ground and agriculture is still possible,” he said. “Our goal is to explore the agrivoltaic option in large-scale PV parks or sites in which the energy business remains the most important one.”
This business model, according to Tula, would be completely different from more “conventional” agrivoltaic projects, where the agricultural business dominates and the panels are usually mounted on special structures at a certain height to enable the use of farm equipment beneath them.
“We are planning to develop a concept that doesn't affect the existing power generation without altering the plant design and, at the same time, which enables a profitable crop business,” Tula explained. “We are not simply adding some agricultural activity on the edge of a plant to make it appear greener.”
The company will manage the demonstration projects in an analytical manner with scientific partners.
“The first answers for our approach should come within 24 months and the collected data should come from test-cultivating an overall surface of nearly 30 hectares scattered across the nine PV facilities, 2 or 3 hectares each,” Tula said, adding that the extent of the new agricultural activity still needs to be evaluated. “It may be around one-third of the plant’s surface. But the right proportion between the crop cultivation and the power generation business will depend on the specific characteristics of each project.”‘
The model can also be adopted in solar plants that already benefit from feed-in tariffs or incentives of different kinds. This could make the integration of agriculture an additional, rather than negligible source of revenue for the plant owners.
Once it is validated by research, the proposed approach should be applied to existing PV plants and new projects.
“We do not expect major design modifications of new projects, except some fine tuning in their layout in order to optimize the integration of the agricultural solution into the PV plant,” Tula said. “Tests on existing plants have been launched with the aim to assess the optimal conditions to scale-up crop cultivation activities, without altering PV design nor plant profitability.”
The company will test several kinds of crops at the pilot projects.
“We will test crops that do not grow too much and we will also see how these crops can alter the albedo in bifacial plants,” Tula said. “We want to plant herbs, flowers, or plants that can act as catalysts for biodiversity, but we also want to test courgettes, broccoli, aubergines, asparagus, legumes, and even animal fodder.”
Enel Green Power also might test certain forms of livestock farming at the solar parks.
“We are thinking, for example, of breeding rabbits of a certain type in central Italy in the province of Viterbo,” Tula explained.
Agricultural alternatives
Tula said agrivoltaics will probably not be developed on a big scale in the years to come.
“But I am also sure it will come sooner than expected,” he said. “I think it is important, however, that we try to define what agrivoltaics could be in the future and, as for now, we are trying to help understand how the agribusiness may find an interesting niche in existing solar parks.”
Tula said a big growth driver for agrivoltaics might come from the agricultural sector itself, as it may decide to opt for PV surfaces for certain kinds of crops.
“We may see PV specializing in some specific agricultural products, excluding of course all kinds of plants with a high stem,” Tula concluded.

France-based MyLight Systems, a solutions provider for monitoring and managing solar self-consumption, has launched a new digital tool to improve the self-consumption of PV system owners.
Called MySmartBattery, the virtual battery system developed by the company claims to ensure 100% self-consumption and to maximize energy savings in prosumers' bills.
The virtual battery, which can be used via a mobile application, is able to record how much surplus solar power is injected into the grid on very sunny days and to return it to the PV system owner at night or in winter. For this service, the user must pay an electricity subscription and a MySmartBattery monthly flat rate, where the costs, including taxes, are related to the supply of the stored kWh.
Using the MyLight systems software, prosumers can also monitor the charge and discharge status of their virtual battery via an application on their smartphone, as well as the portion of their consumption covered by their PV installation.

With the two cabinet ministers having joined the likes of International Renewable Energy Agency chief Francesco la Camera in stating the need to accelerate the global energy transition–and with U.S. climate envoy John Kerry and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen also set to make contributions, young Vanessa Nakate stunned the organisers of the virtual event with a hard-hitting contribution this morning.
With fellow youth activist Brianna Fruean having spoken of seeing a Samoan elder taking a stocktake of children because of fears climate change would destroy his village, an even more hard-hitting message arrived when Nakate took the live stream.

The Kampala-based climate activist opened up to, presumably, stun the organisers by explaining herself and Fruean had originally been given five minutes to make their points only to then have their allotted time reduced to four minutes, and then three-and-a-half minutes.
More infuriatingly for Nakate, both youngsters had to submit their speeches to the organisers in advance of the event–though presumably the address she courageously delivered live differed markedly from the transcript she had handed in.
“Did any of the political leaders speaking today have their speeches submitted in advance?” asked Nakate. “Did any of them have their speech time cut short?”
Claiming both speakers had been ordered not to name and shame any politicians involved in the BETD event, Nakate added: “You should not ask activists to come here and speak at events to make you feel better and then censor them.”
Delivering her stirring, Greta-style condemnation, the Ugandan activist told the likes of Altmaier and Maas it is time to stop talking and start doing. She said it is time to stop investing in uneconomical fossil fuel commitments because: “We cannot eat coal and we cannot drink oil.”
Following Nakate, whose delivery prompted the event's presenter to pledge to take those points on board? Von der Leyen, who can surely never have had a tougher gig to follow up.

The solar park will sell power to Polkomtel Sp. z o.o., which is the network operator of the Polish free-to-air television channel Polsat Group. The owner of the telecommunication company, Polish entrepreneur Zygmunt Solorz-Żak, is also the second-largest shareholder of ZE PAK SA.
The deal is the country's second PPA linked to a solar project after that announced by German developer Baywa re in January.
ZE PAK SA added it also secured a 175 million PNL ($45.5 million) loan for the project from Polish lenders PKO BP SA, Bank Pekao SA, and mBank SA. “The signing of the loan agreement for the Brudzew Farm confirms the interest of the banking sector for the green transformation path chosen by ZE PAK SA,” said the company's board president, Piotr Woźny.
ZE PAK SA's largest shareholder is the Polish government with a 50% stake. ZE PAK has an 8.5% share of the Polish power market, according to its website.
In November 2018, the company had announced a plan to build 70 MW of PV capacity at a depleted area of the extensive Adamów brown coal mine, in the center of Poland, in Turek. The solar project, which has not been built to date, is likely intended to provide the group with the capacity it lost in 2018, when the Adamow power station, a five-unit coal-fired plant with a 600 MW capacity at the mine, was closed.
The use of large scale PV plants among Polish coal providers is gaining traction in Poland. State-owned utility Polska Grupa Energetyczna in 2019 signed a letter of intent with silver and copper producer KGHM Polska Miedź SA to deploy 500 MW of solar generation capacity on the miner’s sites. Energy company Tauron Polska Energia SA also announced a plan to install ground-mounted PV at its disused sites. Electricity provider Zespół Elektrowni Pątnów-Adamów-Konin SA said it would deploy a large scale PV plant at a depleted area of the extensive Adamów brown coal mine in Turek county.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/16/from-minnow-to-colossus/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,EUROPE",,"MARCH 16, 2021",From minnow to colossus,"From pv magazine 03/2021
So how is it possible then, that this small country is close to surpassing Germany’s annual solar installations of 4.88 GW in 2020, and is even approaching a second milestone of installed PV capacity relative to its number of inhabitants? Even during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Dutch solar market grew by 14%. In 2019, almost 2.6 GW were installed and in 2020 just short of 3 GW were added – bringing total installed capacity in the Netherlands to 10 GW.
10 GW solar capacity in the Netherlands makes its annual share in the nation’s electricity mix 6.6%, but during the long summer days, solar’s share can come close to 100%.
Residential segment
The Netherlands is one of the few strong residential markets in Europe. Although many countries have favorable policies in place for the residential segment, Holland can be considered a forerunner, passing the threshold of 1 GW of new capacity last year, and has shown year on year growth of more than 20%.
This strong residential market is primarily due to the country’s net-metering scheme. The program and tariff levels have kept the payback period around the seven-year mark in recent years.
Net metering has resulted in over one million households, or one in eight, with PV panels installed on their roof. The successful net-metering system was planned to be phased-out between 2023 and 2031. However, in February 2020 the Dutch parliament declared that the phasing-out of net-metering was “controversial”, which means the law will not be brought to a vote until after the elections this month.
As a result of this delay, its implementation in 2023 may not occur. Several organizations continue to lobbyat various levels with an aim to keep the unlimited net-metering system in place over a longer timeframe. For now, this means residential PV is highly likely to continue its growth in coming years.
C&I and utility scale
An astonishing volume of almost 11 GW of unrealized PV-capacity is allocated in the SDE+(+)-feed-in subsidy scheme. Following a revision of this scheme in 2020, it now allows annual applications for an available budget of €5 billion.
With the revision of the scheme, the focus is directed more towards CO2 emissions reduction instead of merely electricity production, and more technologies, like CCS and hydrogen, can apply.
Since 2017 most projects, and between one quarter to half of the available budget, has gone to solar. Under current policy, the SDE++ scheme is expected to fund new capacity for renewable generation until 2025.
Image: Baywa r.e.
In the wake of the pandemic, realization deadlines were postponed for projects funded through the SDE-scheme by twelve months. This gives developers and EPCs somewhat more leeway in their planning and in securing project financing. Despite challenging conditions for project realization, 1.8 GW of new capacity was installed in the commercial sector, and more to come in the upcoming years.
Aside from Covid-19, there are other challenges for large scale projects, which lie in their ability to innovate with regard to grid congestion problems. If companies can uphold their business case by increasing flexibility with, for example, curtailment, demand-response and storage, this will increase a project’s prospects for the future expansion of its PV capacity.
Overall, prospects for the Dutch market are sunny. Firstly, increasing the share of renewable sources in electricity supply are safeguarded by legislation under the climate agreement. Secondly, there is increasing attention to electrification of transport and heating along with backup capacity to ensure demand rising along with the renewable energy supply. Thirdly, increasing focus on interconnectedness suggests a tendency to solve challenges of the energy transition on a European level.
The Netherlands is one of only a few countries in Europe that has thriving and mature markets for both residential and non-residential solar. Although it will probably not surpass Germany this year, it will surely surpass the 3 GW threshold by a wide margin, and with luck may be crowned Europe’s solar champion.

The company said in a statement its TopCon devices are expected to reach a 23.5% efficiency in the third quarter of this year. A pv magazine‘s request to provide more details on the new production was left unanswered by the manufacturer.
In its statement, however, URE said it has also achieved a 24.5% efficiency for its n-tpye heterojunction cells and a 26% power rating for a perovskite solar cell that it developed in partnership with the National Taiwan University, without providing further details.
URE has not said if these results were certified by an independent entity.
The manufacturer achieved a turnover of 81,533 million TWD ($288.9 million) in 2020, down significantly from 121,552 million TWD a year earlier. In February, it unveiled a plan to expand its solar module production capacity by 500 MW this year due to strong domestic demand.
The company currently has a solar cell production capacity of 2.5 GW while its panel capacity stands at 1.1 GW.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/16/berlin-energy-transition-dialogue-2021/,,MAX HALL,"UPDATED MARCH 18, 2021 10:01 PM CET",Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue 2021,"I'll close today's coverage with the contribution from U.S. climate ambassador John Kerry, who appears to be speaking from his front room.
After framing the net zero energy system as “the largest market humans have ever known,” Kerry presented some sobering figures.
“I wasn't kidding when I said that this is a decisive decade,” he said. “We need to phase out coal five times faster than we have been doing, based on the rate seen between 2013 and 2018.
“We need to ramp up renewable energy about six times faster. We need to roll-out electric vehicles at a rate about 22 times faster.
“Can we do that? Yes. It's not a question of feasibility, it's a question of political goodwill.”
Overcoming my own technical inadequacies, I've finally been able to track down that keynote speech from European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen this morning–and it was well worth the hunt.
Saint Von Der Leyen, as she's known in these parts, returned to the subject of the steel industry more than once, opening with the efforts of Swedish manufacturers to invest in green-hydrogen-powered production, and that laid the foundations for her presentation of the EU's plans for a carbon border.
Illustrating the delicate diplomatic balancing act between encouraging China to get on board with the fight for climate change and admonishing the world's biggest carbon emitter for its record to date, Von der Leyen said: “Companies, to continue on their way to zero emissions… we must insist on fairness and a level playing field for them. Let me return, for the last time, to the example of steel, one of the most traded commodities in the world.
“We want European companies to heavily invest in expensive technologies to make steel green. Green steel costs around €100 more per ton than traditional, carbon-heavy-produced steel so, clearly, we have to prevent cheap products from abroad from undermining our efforts.”
Referring to the EU's planned ‘carbon border adjustment mechanism'– which Von Der Leyen admirably pronounced in full at every mention–she added: “We will impose a CO2 charge on certain products entering the European Union. We work so hard to reduce our emissions. Thus, we cannot accept to import, at the same time, emissions from abroad.”
That is a message which is likely to be warmly received in the White House and there is no need for any diplomatic tiptoeing in those relations, with Von der Leyen stating: “I must say we are really excited that President Biden rejoined the Paris Agreement on his very first day in office.”
The commission president, addressing the BETD event in her home nation, warned of the dangers of backsliding but was again unable to prevent the feeling the bloc is always forced to hold back on its ambitions due to the need for consensus among its 27 member states.
For instance, Von Der Leyen said: “Carbon must have its price, because nature cannot pay the price any more.” Strong words, but they referred only to a planned expansion of the EU emissions trading scheme (ETS) into new sectors such as the maritime industry. Although the commission president would go on to claim “Our European Green Deal will affect almost all aspects of our daily lives,” even an expanded ETS fails to slap a true carbon cost on all the interactions and decisions in our daily lives.
It is tempting to wonder what Vanessa Nakate would make of it all.
It turns out the press conference which is, I presume, unfolding as we speak is only available in German so, pending publication of an associated English press release which has been promised by the BETD media team, we'll continue to be on hold until the studio resumes broadcasting at 1500.
Which will at least bring us blessed relief from this hold music.
In among all the high-level green transition chatter today, it appears German energy minister Peter Altmaier this morning announced his country will hit its target of producing 40% less carbon emissions, by 2022, compared to 1990 levels. I must have missed that choice nugget of newsworthiness.
Of more pressing importance is the fact my rumbling tummy does not coincide with that of the delegates, who are currently engaged on a TWO-HOUR lunch break of the type most print journalists would be proud of.
There is that aforementioned Canada-Germany energy agreement to be signed in an hour or so, and the studio stuff is set to resume at 1500 so I'm going to shuffle seamlessly into pv magazine copy editing mode until 1430.
Ciao for now.
It seems deputy minister Soltanov did not find time to answer my question although he did later add, on the topic of private versus public funding of renewables: “States are really good at things that states are good at,” with the same being true of corporates.
He elaborated: “States govern well and the private sector knows markets very well.”
We've also heard from Bianca de Bruijn-van der Gaag, of Dutch lender ING, who told us about her employer's global renewables activity–it seems almost churlish to mention that, upon arriving in Genoa 20 months ago I tried to open an account with ING and the local branch said it was no longer open for new customers. Maybe things have eased since then.
Anyhow, I'm going to wrap up the morning coverage so I can enjoy some reheated pizza from last night without the usual conference worry of having to negotiate limited, vastly overpriced menus.
Laterz.
It was interesting to hear the deputy energy minister of Azerbaijan laying out the clean energy ambitions of his oil and gas rich nation.
Speaking as part of a clean energy finance panel comprised of politicians from Jordan, Indonesia, Poland, and Azerbaijan, deputy minister Elnur Soltanov spoke of the green growth economy targeted by his nation and spelled out the $500 million committed in direct foreign investment from Saudi Arabia and the UAE towards clean energy projects “in the years ahead.”
pv magazine has tabled a question for the Azeri spokesman, asking how that compares with spending on oil and gas over the same, vague timeline.
Oh Lord help us, we're now having a summary of what is happening around the event in the ‘Twittersphere', whatever that is. The only thing I've read of interest this morning is Lye Town manager Grant Joshua complaining about the offside law…
Belying his rather owlish demeanor as he stared over the top of his glasses and delivered solemn warnings, The IEA's Birol offered a surprising response when asked whether he was optimistic or pessimistic about the outcomes of this year's COP26 climate change summit in November.
“Definitely optimistic,” said the head of the International Energy Agency, who explained he had three reasons to be cheerful, starting with the political momentum seen around the world, and which can only gain pace with the return of the U.S. to the fold.
Secondly, said Birol, ever cheaper renewable technology makes one simple fact clear: “People will go for those [clean energy] options not only to save the world, but simply because they are cheaper.”
And finally, perhaps chastened by the powerful condemnation of climate activist Vanessa Nakate earlier on, Birol hailed the crucial role global youth could play in demanding an energy transition.
“I see the youth is behind this very strong momentum,” he added. “If the world's youth come together– and they are coming together–they can be a very strong engine for change.”
International Energy Agency (IEA) executive director Fatih Birol has made the stark warning the world is in danger of missing “an historic opportunity to make the 2019 emissions … a peak.”
Birol said the IEA observed global emissions had rebounded higher than pre-Covid-19 levels by December, as economies around the world recovered from the pandemic.
“In the absence of decisive government policies,” warned Birol, “emissions will not go down.”
He has noted the lack of climate finance in developing nations as well as fears of a shortage in minerals for clean energy technology, including solar panels.
We are back with IRENA boss Francesco la Camera, who is presenting a flagship report from his organisation which puts some figures on the energy transition.
With La Camera predicting renewable energy will do around a quarter of the heavy lifting towards a net-zero energy system in mid century, the IRENA director-general said there is currently $98 trillion needed to reach that goal.
However, doing so in a manner which will keep global warming to no more than 1.5C will require an additional $33 trillion, according to IRENA.
Frustratingly, Saudi energy minister Abdulaziz bin Salman was cut short just as he was preparing to give an example of how a just energy transition means ensuring all nations have access to the technology required, rather than just a select few countries.
Bin Salman had said the energy transition would need to consider the situation in all of the world's nations, to be truly inclusive. That might have set the stage for a pitch for a tapering down of the fossil fuels Saudi Arabia is such a big exporter of, rather than the blunt cut-off required to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement but we'll never know, because he was stopped by the moderator, who wanted to give Chinese politician Lin his say.
Please forgive the tech problems we have, inevitably, encountered this morning–I think I've recovered all the blog posts which vanished now.
With all the kerfuffle caused by Vanessa Nakate's contribution, I've managed to miss Ursula von der Leyen's entire keynote speech. Ho hum, I'm sure she would agree Nakate's speech should take priority, including the allegation, made by the Ugandan activistn that she was banned, along with fellow speaker Brianna Fruean, from criticising any of the politicians taking part in BETD 2021.
Those speakers include Shangqing Lin, vice minister of China's National Energy Administration, who has just spoken of his nation's commitment to reaching the goal of carbon neutrality by 2060, albeit without fleshing out any concrete policy actions to be introduced to attain that goal.
Young climate campaigner Vanessa Nakate has absolutely stolen the show already today with a stunning indictment of the big-name politicians which preceded her here at BETD 2021.
The Kampala-based youngster opened up to, presumably, stun the organisers by explaining her and fellow youth campaigner Brianna Fruean, from Samoa, had originally been given five minutes to make their points only to then have their allotted time reduced to four minutes, and then three-and-a-half minutes.
More infuriatingly for Nakate, both youngsters had to submit their speeches to the organisers in advance of the event–though presumably the address she courageously delivered on the live stream differed markedly from that transcript.
“Did any of the political leaders speaking today have their speeches submitted in advance?” asked Nakate. “Did any of them have their speech time cut short?
“You should not ask activists to come here and speak at events to make you feel better and then censor them.”
Delivering her stirring, Greta-style condemnation, the Ugandan activist told the likes of Altmaier and Maas it is time to stop talking and start doing. It is time to stop investing in uneconomical fossil fuel commitments because: “We cannot eat coal and we cannot drink oil.”
Altmaier–The Most Powerful Man in Berlin (TMPMiB)–is back center stage.
There is, perhaps inevitably a bit of repetition here as the energy minister again stresses the importance of America's return to the fold.
He has delivered the genuinely exciting news that European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. presidential envoy for climate John Kerry will be taking part in BETD 2021. As he put it in a slightly starstruck vein: “Heiko Maas and I have both called him [Kerry] on the phone.”
The minister has spoken of how Germany defied the naysayers who said it would not be possible to transform the energy system of such an industry-heavy nation, especially one without vast hydropower resources. Germany has nonetheless reached the point where almost half its electricity comes from non-hydro renewables.
He is placing a lot of stress on the importance of green hydrogen to take us the rest of the way to net zero and has also mentioned the “tens of thousands of jobs” which will be created in Europe with the development of battery gigafactories.
Mentioning Elon Musk–and his alternative propulsion technology–won't be bad for the online visitor click numbers either.
We're not sure when Kerry and climate champion Von Der Leyen will be dropping in but we'll try and keep an eye on that one for you.
Apparently there's more going on!
Foreign minister Heiko Maas is giving an address in a different room, with a much nicer backdrop.
He is discussing what contribution green hydrogen can make to the energy transition and has touched on the fact fossil-fuel-dependent nations including Saudi Arabia and Russia must be helped to change their way of doing business. Apparently Germany already has people in both nations helping draft hydrogen policy.
That's it for now folks, apparently all the live-event hullabaloo here at BETD 2021 is on hold until 1430 (CET) when we will have live coverage of the signing of an energy partnership between Germany and Canada.
Who signs first? Will they go biro or fountain pen–or maybe opt for the Trump route with a crayon? Oh the excitement!
Join us later, when we will hopefully also learn some details of what the partnership amounts to and, ideally, will be able to cut through the high-level ambition stuff and get our teeth into some real solar … not least because, now that the morning session has finished, I think I've worked out how to ask questions using the chat panel.
Herr Altmaier opened up with his best Elvis impression, stating: “It's now or never” for the energy transition.
He talked of how both the Green Deal for Europe and Germany's hydrogen strategy have been adopted by other global nations and appear set to swiftly become mainstream policy.
The federal minister for economic affairs and energy also welcomed the return of the U.S. to sanity (he may not have put it in precisely those terms but you get the drift).
“We have the huge opportunity that the U.S. has not only joined the climate agreement of Paris, but is playing a leading role in reaching climate neutrality,” said Altmaier.
“With the U.S. on board, it becomes an easier task, so I'm delighted John Kerry and Jennifer Granholm, the new energy secretary, have signaled they want to play a decisive role in that respect.”
The ministers have taken the podium, that's German energy minister Peter Altmaier “the most powerful man in Berlin” on the left of the screen, and foreign minister Heiko Maas.
Andreas Kuhlmann, head of the German Energy Agency–which, for some unfathomable reason is initialised as ‘dena'–has suggested the Covid-19 crisis has permitted the world to hit the pause button and take stock of what needs to be done to achieve the climate goals set in Paris.
The organisers are doing a sterling job of filling until the German foreign minister is ready to give his thoughts. Apparently we will join Herr Maas in 10 minutes or so. His remarks will be translated into English, thank heavens.
Francesco la Camera, director-general of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is laying out exactly what needs to be done to the global energy system to save the planet.
It's been a predictably chaotic start to our coverage of the event, with me spooked by the fact I can find no obvious way of turning off my audio for the Zoom-hosted meeting.
Let's hope the German cabinet heavyweights won't be too perturbed by the sounds of the morning ablutions of the Zacco-Hall household and my suddenly-very-noisy-sounding tapping away at my keyboard."
https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/16/new-optical-coating-could-extend-lifetime-of-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"MARCH 16, 2021",New optical coating could extend lifetimes of solar cells,"U.S. researchers have developed a new class of optical coatings that could make PV cells last six times longer than usual, which in turn could reduce the cost of replacing worn-out cells.
The project is a collaboration between scientists at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) in Ohio and the University of Rochester in New York.
Optical coatings are layers of material deposited on a surface to either reflect or filter light into different wavelengths. They are an integral part of almost every optical instrument, from eyeglasses to telescopes.
The new coatings can be made to fully reflect a narrow wavelength that corresponds to the range that efficiently produces electricity by a PV cell. That means the new coatings could lead to a high-performance, low-cost solution for solar energy generation, said Giuseppe Strangi, a physics professor at CWRU.
The PV problem is twofold. Solar panels produce energy efficiently during the day, when energy demand is relatively low, but not after sunset, when demand remains high. And storing energy generated by PV panels can be expensive.
Strangi and his collaborators created a novel coating made from a 15- nanometer-thick film of germanium (similar to silicon or tin) that can simultaneously reflect and transmit the same wavelength, or color, and do both with a high degree of clarity.
The researchers call this new class of coatings Fano Resonance Optical Coatings (FROCs), in a nod to Ugo Fano, an Italian-born American physicist who worked with nuclear scientist Enrico Fermi.
Shaped resonances – essentially, a phenomenon in which two light waves are superimposed – are the foundation of light wave transport, and also the development of this new class of optical coatings.
The new coatings, in addition to their ability to be fine-tuned to reflect the perfect PV wavelength, can also be made to absorb the rest of the solar spectrum. That means they could efficiently transfer those wavelengths to heat. And storing that thermal energy is relatively inexpensive, compared to storing electricity.
Such an approach would also protect the PV cell from overheating, leading to the promise of a sixfold increase in the lifespan of PV cells, Strangi said. However, the solar PV energy application in this new process of manipulating wave-optics at the nanoscale will take some time to develop, the scientists noted. New advancements in optical coatings also could lead to other applications, the researchers added. They recently described their findings in Nature Nanotechnology.

India's largest floating solar plant – a 100 MW solar array – could be operational within the next few months. 
NTPC is now building a floating solar plant on the Sri Ram Sagar Project Reservoir in the Indian state of Telangana. It spans a water surface of 450 acres. The plant will likely be commissioned by June, NTPC’s southern region executive director, CV Anand, told reporters this week. Upon completion, the project will be the nation’s largest single-site floating solar plant to date, he said. 
However, India is also set to host a 600 MW floating solar plant in Khandwa district, Madhya Pradesh. The plant will likely be completed in the 2022-23 period. The state’s new and renewable energy minister, Hardeep Singh Dang, has claimed that the floating PV array will be the world’s largest upon completion.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/16/new-deals-in-australias-growing-redox-flow-battery-sector/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,JAPAN,UNITED STATES",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 16, 2021",New deals in Australia’s growing redox flow battery sector,"From pv magazine Australia
Australian flow-battery specialist Redflow has won its biggest global contract yet after signing a $1.2 million agreement with California-based Anaergia, under which it will supply a 2 MWh energy storage system made up of 192 zinc-bromine flow batteries for an Anaergia facility in San Bernardino, California.
Anaergia COO Yaniv Scherson said that Redflow’s zinc-bromine flow batteries are “uniquely suited to meet the demands of the Rialto site.” Anaergia recovers value from waste at its bioenergy facility, which already features its own 2 MW biogas-fueled cogeneration microgrid. The Redflow system will help to reduce peak energy usage in the late afternoon and early evening, to maximize the microgrid’s efficiency.
The storage is laid out via 12 “Energy Pods,” each of which contains 16 Redflow batteries linked to external inverters. With each battery storing approximately 10.5 KWh, the overall capacity should sit at around 2 MWh.
Once the facility is fully operational, it will be the biggest landfill diverted organic waste digester plants in North America. It will convert 700 tons of organic waste from Los Angeles and Southern California per day, while turning 300 tons of biosolids into renewable natural gas and Class A fertilizer.
Redflow Managing Director and CEO Tim Harris said the facility is an “ideal use case for Redflow zinc-bromine flow batteries.” There will likely be much interest in California for its energy storage systems. A recent study by the California Energy Storage Alliance (CESA) suggests that the state will need 150 times more long-duration energy storage, between 45-55 GW, to reach its net-zero by 2045 target.
Comprehensive deal
In a separate development, Technology Metals Australia, a West Australian vanadium explorer, has signed a deal with Japan's LE System, which specializes in vanadium redox flow batteries. The deal, which is effective until the end of this year, will see the two companies investigate the application of LE System’s proprietary technology to Technology Metals Australia’s vanadium projects. It will also explore the production of vanadium redox flow battery electrolytes in Western Australia, as well as selling high purity iron-vanadium concentrate to Japanese customers.
Technology Metals Australia’s primary exploration focus is the Gabanintha Vanadium Project (GVP), located 40 kilometers south east of Meekatharra, Western Australia. It seeks to develop a processing technique to produce high-purity vanadium pentoxide, with the goal of becoming one of the world’s largest single primary vanadium producers.
In 2019, the company secured funding from the Australian federal government’s Research and Development (R&D) Tax Incentive Scheme, which went towards its Gabanintha Project. 
Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) are rechargeable flow batteries which use vanadium in different oxidation states to store energy. Flow batteries have enjoyed a recent resurgence of attention as an energy storage solution, driven by the fact that VRFBs are non-flammable, offer virtually unlimited cycling without degradation, and are easily scalable.
The Technology Metals agreement will see LE Systems apply its proprietary processing technology to extract vanadium and other metals from the Gabanintha Vanadium Project’s waste streams. The companies said they have been working on the plan together for “for some time.”
“Successful application of the proprietary processing technology to the GVP waste streams would provide LES with access to a low-cost, stable supply of vanadium products and provide Technology Metals with potential environmental management benefits,” Technology Metals said on Monday.
A partnership with LE System, which is on track to becoming a key VRFB electrolyte provider, opens up new pathways for Technology Metals' downstream processing strategy. Specifically, the deal will see the two companies investigate opportunities to use proprietary technology to manufacture VRFB electrolyte in Western Australia.
“With the necessity of large capacity storage batteries rapidly increasing, the successful technology collaboration and business cooperation between TMT and LE System are very important to us,” said LE System CEO Junichi Sato.
Under the terms of the deal, the two parties have agreed to investigate the opportunity to jointly produce electrolyte for the VRFB market in Western Australia. They will initially focus on the use of vanadium sourced from GVP waste streams, but there is potential to expand by using the high-purity vanadium to be produced from the project.
“This opportunity would have scope to establish a significant downstream value adding industry designed to target what TMT sees as the rapidly emerging stationary storage battery market opportunities in Australia,” Technology Metals said.
