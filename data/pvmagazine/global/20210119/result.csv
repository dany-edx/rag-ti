The company will invest around RMB18 billion (US$2.73 billion) in the new factory, which is expected to be completed in two phases by March 2023. More details on the module technology that will be produced at the factory were not provided.
Solar panel maker Risen stated on Monday it will build a new factory in Jintan county, Jiangsu province. The new manufacturing facility will have a capacity of 4 GW for solar cells and 6 GW for solar modules. The total investment is expected to reach around RMB5.28 billion.
Polysilicon manufacturer GCL-Poly on Friday continued its fundraising efforts as the deadline for settling US$500 million of senior notes approaches at the end of the month. There was no opposition from shareholders to the proposed sale of 217 MW of Chinese solar project capacity to state-owned Xuzhou State Investment and Environmental Protection Energy, to raise RMB985 million (US$152 million) and remove RMB951 million of liabilities from GCL’s books. The company will book a RMB27.4 million (US$4.23 million) loss on the sale, based on the projected value of the solar plants. GCL company will have to settle US$500 million of senior notes by January 30 and the terms of a proposal for investors to suspend payment for three years are set to expire in a week's time.
Panel producer Solargiga on Friday reported significant rises in revenue and shipment volume figures for last year, compared with 2019. The unaudited figures showed revenue rose more than 37% from RMB4.4 billion (US$678 million) in 2019 to RMB6.04 billion. Shipments rose almost 65%, from 4.13 GW to 6.81 GW, according to the company.
China's largest energy company, the State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC), deployed 22.6 GW of renewable energy power generation capacity in 2020. Of this installed power, around 10.28 GW was for solar installations and approximately 11.58 GW for wind farms. At the end of last year, SPIC reached a cumulative clean energy capacity of 98.88 GW, of which 60.49 GW is solar, which makes the company the largest PV asset owner in the world. Its total power generation capacity has now reached 176 GW, of which 56.09% is from clean energy.

The International Finance Corp (IFC) private-sector arm of the World Bank has crunched the numbers and calculated a green recovery from the pandemic could generate 213 million jobs and $10.2 trillion of investment this decade in 21 emerging market economies.
As part of that calculation, carried out with U.S.-based market research company Guidehouse Insights, the IFC stated solar panels would supply 83% of the estimated $900 billion investment and 23.9 million jobs which could be created by funding small-scale, ‘distributed' generation and energy storage systems.
The IFC report considered ten key sectors which would reap the biggest rewards in the emerging markets studied, in terms of investment opportunity, job creation and greenhouse gas reduction. The sectors of the economy examined included the expansion of renewables capacity – with grid scale and distributed systems considered separately; the decarbonization of heavy industry; and the greening of urban transport.
Utility scale renewables investment over the next ten years could offer a $1.6 trillion investment opportunity, create 18.9 million new jobs and remove 813 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the study. The report compiled figures across 21 nations in six global regions. Grid scale renewables could offer a $787 billion investment and 7.9 million new jobs in the East Asia and Pacific region comprised of China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam, according to the IFC, with most of that opportunity represented by China, the world's solar capital.
The South Asian markets of Bangladesh and India would offer a $424 billion grid scale renewables opportunity and 4.3 million jobs to 2030; followed by Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico), with $187 billion and 2.5 million jobs; Europe (Russia, Serbia, Turkey and Ukraine), with $83.7 billion and 1.4 million openings; sub-Saharan Africa (Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa), with $63.6 billion and 2.2 million new positions; and the Middle East and North Africa (Egypt, Jordan and Morocco), with a $46.3 billion market and the potential for 500,000 jobs.
In addition to the usual calls for governments to help by drafting supportive policy, offering skills training and reducing planning red tape, the IFC demonstrated its private-sector credentials by advising against the application of local content requirements and state-owned-grid-company monopolies. The authors of the report also stressed the need to amend regulatory systems to properly reward flexible grid and energy storage capacity.
In terms of the rewards on offer from expanded small scale and off-grid renewables capacity, the report split the anticipated investment opportunity as $570 billion for residential systems and $341 billion from commercial assets, with a potential 23.9 million new jobs available this decade. East Asia would offer a $525 billion market and 13.2 million jobs, according to the study; South Asia $283 billion and 7.1 million jobs; Latin America $52.7 billion and 1.9 million positions; Europe $33.4 billion and 900,000 opportunities; sub-Saharan Africa $10 billion and 500,000 vacancies; and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region $7.3 billion and 200,000 openings.
The IFC called for a standardized small scale renewables quality ratings system to help investors aggregate such small installations into more attractive and easier-to-manage portfolios.
Despite trailing green hydrogen as one of two solutions for decarbonizing heavy industry, however, the report gave the impression the sustainable form of the fuel had been tacked on as an afterthought, as most of the heavy industry section emphasized the promise of carbon capture, usage and storage – to the extent no estimates or recommendations were offered up related to green hydrogen.
With the study considering the global textile industry as one of its key emerging market sectors for decarbonization, the IFC cited its work to drive renewables capacity among the supply chain companies of global clothing brands Levi and H&M, but the real headline figures were related to the greening of urban transport.
With the IFC considering private transport and commercial delivery fleets under that header, along with public transport, the study estimated the sector could represent a $2.7 trillion market this decade and supply 53.4 million new jobs. Recommendations included expanding public transport networks and cashless payment; reducing the cost of electric vehicle finance; local authorities expanding charging infrastructure; staggering public employee working times to ease rush hours; and applying sustainability requirements to support for motor manufacturers.
The other key sectors studied in the IFC report were energy efficient building retrofits; low carbon municipal waste and water; nature-based urban infrastructure; climate-smart agriculture; and low carbon shipping and aviation.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/19/is-china-really-opening-its-energy-market-to-eu-enterprises/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 19, 2021",Is China really opening its energy market to EU enterprises?,"China and the European Union recently signed the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI), which will give EU companies more access to the Chinese market. Please describe the access that EU companies had to the Chinese market before the deal – was it impossible to get market share?
Prior to signing the CAI, European companies either teamed up with local Chinese partners or set up their own 100% subsidiaries. Their engagement covered a wide range along both the upstream and downstream sectors of the renewable market – as a manufacturer, service provider, or project developer.
The deal sets out clear rules for Chinese state-owned enterprises, the transparency of subsidies, forced technology transfers, and other distortive practices. Which provisions are really creating conditions for a more level playing field in China?
Transparency in all aspects, regarding the announcement of new policies, administrative regulations, access to and the mobilization of local financing, the allocation of subsidies, the removal of provisions designed to ensure that the local Chinese partner will be the majority stakeholder, just to name a few.

The Chinese energy market is still dominated by large state-owned entities (SOEs) – how can European companies compete in this environment?
True, large SOEs dominate the downstream energy market, whereas the upstream sector is rather dominated by privately owned Chinese companies, particularly as far as the solar PV market is concerned. Given the size of these SOEs, it is undeniably challenging for European companies to compete on the same level. However, not impossible either – EU companies may not develop gigawatt-size projects, but can choose to develop smaller-scale projects instead. On the contrary, I assume, transmission and distribution of power via the national grid will not be an option for foreign companies … due to reasons of national security. Where solar manufacturing is concerned, currently I can’t imagine a single European company being in the position to compete with countless double-digit-gigawatt factories in China.
Is it possible that big European players and utilities may build, own, and operate energy assets in China in the near future? Would a similar development only be possible if these big companies seek Chinese partners?
Yes, we have seen companies like Total, Engie or Siemens being active in the downstream sector – usually through local partnerships. However, once EU companies have gained sufficient on-the-ground experience, they may decide to move on without a local partner in future.
Will there be a real chance for EU-based companies to gain market share in the PV sector? In which market segments is this most likely to happen?
Provided EU companies have an appetite for gaining a foothold in the Chinese solar PV market, I would reckon that the commercial and industrial rooftop segment might be the most promising, because this to date is a largely untapped segment. However, to put this into perspective, at the beginning of 2021, China was home to approximately 320,000 companies operating in the entire solar sector. And last year alone, another 58,000 companies were registered, up 22% year on year. Last year, out of in total 10.1 GW, approximately 4.57 GW of residential PV systems were installed in the province of Shandong alone. So it does not surprise that approximately up to 48,000 new companies were registered in the same province. Hence, in my view, the residential PV segment shouldn’t be the first choice of EU companies when considering the Chinese solar PV market.
Government procurement and subsidies are not covered by the deal. Does this mean that only Chinese companies will continue to win auctions and tenders for large-scale and small-sized solar?
(This year) shall be the first year that China's solar PV market enters a subsidy-free era – at least, as far as the ground-mounted and C&I rooftop segments are concerned. Hence, subsidies shall no longer be relevant in future – competition is being determined by the market. Auctions, often solely conducted by governmental entities on both the national and provincial levels, are open to locally registered companies, regardless of ownership. Tenders seeking the procurement of modules and inverters in particular are increasingly offered by large SOEs themselves. They are also open to locally registered companies, regardless of local or foreign ownership.
Could European PV products be installed in large-scale projects or rooftop arrays in China? Do you believe EU brands and technologies could become attractive for Chinese consumers, even though Chinese products are good in terms of quality?
If “Made in the EU” products would be competitive, yes. But is this realistic if one just takes the duration and costs incurred for transportation into account? True, you may have international companies based in China that prefer so-called “green labeled low-carbon footprint” products. Under such conditions, this might be an option.
Which kinds of products might be preferred?
Currently, EU solar manufacturing equipment is still in demand. And being closer to their customers, to manufacture such equipment in China, might prove to be more advantageous.
Will this agreement also increase chances for Chinese companies to operate in the EU energy market? If it is true that Chinese PV products dominate in the European market, it is also true that there are not too many energy assets owned by Chinese players in Europe. If we look at recent PV tenders in France, Germany, Spain or Italy, the winners are mostly domestic EPCs and developers.
Over the course of the last 10 years, Chinese PV manufacturers managed to establish themselves as the No. 1 suppliers in the European PV market. However, during the past one to two years, I witnessed a growing interest among Chinese companies to consider either acquiring operational assets or developing projects in certain European PV markets as well. Their interest and appetite appear to grow in this regard. However, in the future, I assume that EU tenders will mostly be won by EU players, and vice versa in China.
China and the EU have agreed to support high-level protection of the environment and labor rights. Many in Europe have strongly criticized the deal because they say it will help China maintain the status quo. But others claim these kinds of agreement will bring China closer to Western standards. Which is your opinion?
Above all, it’s commendable that such issues are explicitly addressed by the CAI. The devil will be in the details, as always. That means how relevant regulations and laws will be implemented, enforced, or eventually harmonized remains to be seen in the years to come.

The Mitsubishi Electric Corp unit of the Japanese conglomerate and the national research university have announced the development of the system, which will be evaluated from April.
A press release issued by the two institutions yesterday revealed Mitsubishi developed the energy trading platform and Tokyo Tech the blockchain and clearing algorithm in a system which enables users to state and match trading goals without the vast banks of computing power required for the sort of blockchain set-ups used in cryptocurrency mining.
Prosumer households in Japan – capable of generating as well as consuming electricity – need a new source of revenue for any excess power they generate now new installations no longer qualify for FIT payments.
With only retail power companies allowed to sell electricity in Japan, peer-to-peer trading systems operated under the management of such entities are being tested, according to the press release.

Therefore, it was impossible to assess even the most basic information, such as how many market players there are, what their installed capacities are, what kind of technologies they employ, and how much of their production is exported, etc.
The first version was compiled from the responses of 16 of the 22 Turkish PV panel manufacturers contacted. It will be updated periodically. Manufacturing companies included in the report are: Alfa Solar, Ankara Solar, CW Enerji, Elin Enerji, Gazioğlu Solar, Gest Enerji, GTC, 2H Enerji, HT Solar, Mirsolar, Ödül Enerji, Parla Solar, Seha Solar, Schmid-Pekintaş, Smart Solar and Solarturk.
It should be noted that the August 2020 inauguration of Kalyon’s 500 MW/year PV panel integrated manufacturing plant, which includes module, cell, wafer and ingot processes, and is located in Ankara Baskent, in the Organized Industrial Zone (OIZ), occurred after the report was completed, and will be taken into account during the revision in Q1 2021.
The key findings include:
Recently, we have been witnessing serious attempts by Europe to take the leadership in PV panel manufacturing back from the Far East. Along with technology development-oriented PV module efficiency increase, becoming more competitive globally with new materials, and updated production techniques are at the heart of it. This initiative is also supported by the strategy and financial resources within the scope of the European Green Deal. We think that it is critical for the manufacturers in Turkey to closely follow this wind of change and take the advantage of strategic opportunities in this development.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/19/smart-meters-disrupt-residential-pv-segment-in-belgiums-flanders-region/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,BELGIUM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 19, 2021",Smart meters disrupt residential PV segment in Belgium’s Flanders region,"Belgium's constitutional court has ruled that the regulation of the Flemish-speaking macro-region of Flanders that allows the owners of PV systems with a capacity of up to 10 kW to keep operating under net metering for up to 15 years after the grid-connection date, is unconstitutional.
The legislation, which was in force since 2019, introduced the mandatory installation of smart meters and granted residential PV system owners a 15-year grace period during which they could continue to operate under net metering with a smart digital meter, just like if they still had a standard meter. These provisions established that PV system owners could decide whether to install a smart meter and calculate net metering tariffs based on presumed electricity consumption or embrace smart meters and receive payments based on actual electricity usage.
The ruling affects more than 100,000 PV system owners and even more in the coming months, as smart meters are being rolled out, and can result in financial losses. The Flemish energy minister, Zuhal Demir, said she was disappointed by the decision of the constitutional court and said that solar system owners will be somehow compensated. “Operators of PV installations that don't have a smart meter can apply for compensation when installing it,” she explained, adding that solar arrays that were recently grid-connected will be prioritized.
“The government makes a distinction between people who have already achieved a lot of return from their investment and those who have barely achieved any return,” the minister explained. “Those who installed solar panels in 2010 have already achieved a very good return from their investment thanks to, among other things, green certificates. This is a big difference from a family that invested in 2020 and now has a financial hangover.”
The Flemish government said it will calculate the refunding amount for each installation year in euros per kilowatt of installed power, by the end of the week. Applications for the refunding will likely be accepted from the summer and first payments should be done from the autumn.
“From 14 January 2021 on, everyone with a digital meter and PV will lose net metering billing,” the managing director at Flemish renewable energy association Organisatie voor Duurzame Energie Vlaanderen, Dirk Van Evercooren, told pv magazine yesterday. “Not everyone is hit in the same way by this decision and some even benefit, because with net metering also the prosumer tariff will die,” he further explained. “This is logical, as the prosumer tariff was the counterpart decided by the regulator to compensate for the non-paid grid use by the prosumer.”
Most of Flanders' installed PV capacity is represented by PV systems not exceeding 10 kW in size installed under a green certificate scheme which expired a few years ago, or under the net metering regime, which is now expected to be replaced by a feed-in premium system based on contracts for difference.
Each of Belgium’s three macro-regions, including Wallonia and Brussels, has its own regulatory framework for solar and renewable energy. The country has the potential to reach 18 GW of solar capacity by 2040, according to a late-2017 report by grid operator Elia.

“We are planning to build a solar park, like those in Abu Dhabi, Portugal and Saudi Arabia,” said minister Dadan Kusdiana, noting eastern Indonesia has a dry climate, high solar radiation levels and low rainfall.
The region is indeed particularly suitable for large scale PV deployment. “Eastern Indonesia is good because solar irradiation is generally higher than in other regions and the province of East Nusa Tenggara has one of the highest,” Marlistya Citraningrum, the program manager for sustainable energy access at the Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR), told pv magazine. “Higher PV output means more energy generated, and the availability of cheaper land with good contour and suitable slope also means we can drive down installation cost, lowering the electricity price.”
According to her, the government needs to lower overall electricity generation costs, which are higher in eastern Indonesia because of the extensive use of diesel power plants. “Energy access remains an issue there and renewable energy must be one of the answers,” she also stated.
As for western Indonesia, Citraningrum said the region is currently facing overcapacity and new solar power plants will probably be met with reluctance from Indonesian utility PT PLN (Persero), which in December started a pre-qualification process on its procurement portal to choose independent power producers to develop utility scale solar plants. “The call for IPPs is not exactly because PLN will tender solar power plants, it is probably a measure to update their list of pre-qualified companies or to anticipate the coming presidential regulation on feed-in tariffs,” she further explained.
Indonesia began supporting large scale PV via a law issued in April 2017. The country’s cumulative installed PV capacity remains negligible, at roughly 198 MW by the end of 2019, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
The Indonesian government is targeting to deploy 6.5 GW of solar by 2025 and 45 GW by 2050.

And since the technology’s behavior at many levels is quite different to that of more established PV technologies, simply applying the industry standards based on these might not paint a full picture of either the potential or the risks that come with this new technology.
When it comes to laboratory testing to confirm efficiency achievements and other aspects, an unofficial standard has emerged to account for the differences in perovskite’s behavior compared with silicon. This involves a longer exposure to light accompanied by monitoring of the maximum power point to ensure a stable measurement.
Measuring the long-term performance of a cell or module in an outdoor setting, however, is a more complex affair with many more factors to consider. And doing this accurately will be key to convincing the industry of perovskite technology’s potential, developing appropriate new standards to ensure quality, and opening up new pathways to further improve on efficiency and durability.
With this in mind, scientists at Jaume I University in Spain and Colombia’s University of Antioquia developed a new methodology to monitor the outdoor performance of perovskite PV modules, utilizing the ‘ideality factor’, which measures how closely actual device performance follows the calculated performance of an ‘ideal’ device. The group noted further properties of perovskite cells, such as the weak dependence of open-circuit voltage on temperature, to develop a methodology that could both determine the lifetime of a module (the time it takes for performance to degrade to 80% of its initial value) and also to better understand and limit the mechanisms that cause performance degradation.
The methodology is described in the paper High-throughput analysis of the ideality factor to evaluate the outdoor performance of perovskite solar minimodules, published in Nature Energy. To validate it, the group fabricated ‘minimodules’ of the perovskite methylammonium lead-triiodide and placed these outdoors to gather performance data.
By monitoring the ideality factor, the group was able to monitor three separate degradation patterns in the material. And for perovskite cells and modules, they suggest that reporting data on nominal operating cell temperature could offer a high throughput method for assessing outdoor performance in the future.
“The main advantage of this approach is that it provides direct physical insight related to recombination processes,” the researchers explain. “…complementary analysis and determination of [the ideality factor] can provide critical information for device characterization and the understanding of degradation processes to accelerate the optimization of this technology or other technologies with similar properties that could be under development.”

Northern Australia is home to a number of plans to create a new clean energy export industry. The 10 GW Sun Cable solar project slated for the Northern Territory and the 15-26 GW solar and wind Asian Renewable Energy Hub (AERH) in Western Australia's Pilbara region are leading the way.
While seemingly impossibly sized, the projects are seeing support from influential energy industry analysts.
“The two mega-projects would elevate Australia to a renewable energy export superpower,” said Ernst & Young’s (EY) infrastructure advisory director Jomo Owusu, when releasing the consultancy’s 2020 Renewable Country Attractiveness.
The EY analysis noted that such projects could allow Australia to remain an energy exporter, as coal and gas exports recede.
Renewable energy analyst Michael Liebreich, the cofounder of what is now BloombergNEF, says that he too is “very impressed by the Australian developments …  it’s all about industrial processes, it might be hydrogen, it might be desalination. I would love to see them linking up with ammonia and fertilizer production as it’s easily storable and transportable. Most of the process in renewables in Australia has been on the supply side, notwithstanding the efforts of the federal government, which has just been confused and misguided. The more difficult question is demand and that’s what I like about the plans for the Pilbara.”
Liebreich explains that in locations where there is available low-cost land and a strong wind and solar resource, the cheap electricity produced at good capacity factors will cause a migration of energy intensive industries, or the production of hydrogen – the latter only when transportation challenges can be addressed.
“Wherever you can have both very cheap wind and solar – and when you connect those two then you don’t have the 22% capacity factor of solar, but you can get to 60% – then there really is an economic strategic advantage,” says Liebreich.
Crunching the numbers, Liebreich says that while sub-$0.015/kWh may not be achievable from solar in Australia today, something approaching $0.03-0.04/kWh could be possible. Adding a battery storage component, at $0.05/kWh for “the biggest batteries in the world,” then energy intensive industries could be attracted. “When these costs can be achieved then there is strong argument that all energy intensity industry will be migrating to these sorts of areas.”
Liebreich suggests that outside of Australia, some parts of the United States, some parts of China, India, Chile, and Spain, or “almost all of North Africa and the Gulf,” could support such “renewable superpower” conditions.
“They [GW-scale renewable projects] are very significant because it was not that long ago that 10 MW was the size of solar projects – maybe a little over a decade ago. When you get to 2 GW that is a lot of power.”

The Puerto Rico Energy Bureau has ordered utility PREPA to issue six procurements in the next 30 months, totaling 3.75 GW of solar and 1.5 GW of four-hour storage, or their equivalents.
PREPA will issue the first of the six procurements “as early in 2021 as possible,” the utility said in a regulatory filing. Regulators had set a target release date of last December for that first procurement, to secure 1,000 MW of solar and 500 MW of storage.
A study released by PREPA in mid-January, however, concludes that Puerto Rico’s grid can handle only 650 MW of utility-scale renewable generation, including existing renewables. That value does not reflect “expected system upgrades or energy storage systems that will be incorporated in the near future,” said the study, which was prepared by engineering consultants Sargent & Lundy.
“We understand that the system supports between 500 and 600 megawatts” of renewables, PREPA Board Chairman Ralph Kreil told local newspaper El Nuevo Dia, in an apparent reference to the study. “Amd the bureau understands that it must be 1,000.”
Kreil added that PREPA’s request for proposals will call for 1,000 MW of solar. “As the bureau says, and we will see what happens.”
The Puerto Rico Energy Bureau’s dockets for this matter are NEPR-MI-2020-0012 and CEPR-AP-2018-0001.
“We have 3% renewable energy” in Puerto Rico, said PJ Wilson, president of the Solar+Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico. “We can build 2,000 MW of renewables before we get the integration challenges that they saw in Hawaii and elsewhere. Let’s get construction going on those 2,000 MW now, and solve the integration challenges for higher levels as we go.”
Wilson said that PREPA indicated last week that each solar and storage procurement would be issued via the utility’s software, PowerAdvocate. He charged that the procurements would be “posted publicly nowhere” so that “not even the energy bureau” would be able to see it. The association he leads plans to ask the energy bureau to order PREPA to post each request for proposals in a public docket.
Puerto Rico’s Act 17, enacted in 2019, requires PREPA to reach 20% renewable generation by 2022 and 40% renewables by 2025.
The energy bureau’s Final Resolution and Order on PREPA’s integrated resource plan provided a target schedule of six solar and storage procurements by June 2023, which is intended to enable the projects to go online by 2025:
