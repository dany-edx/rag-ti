And while other battery types, and other forms of storage entirely, are out there, lithium-ion will likely represent the largest share of storage projects connecting to the world’s electricity grids, as well as powering electric vehicles and other important technologies.
This has led many to highlight concerns around materials commonly used in today’s lithium-ion batteries, and the search for alternatives is a focus for scientists and research and development teams the world over.
One group of scientists led by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the United States worked with a type of material called a disordered rocksalt with excess lithium (DRX). They developed a cathode design that relies on a different type of reaction to lithium-ion batteries produced today, and could potentially hold more lithium ions, and open a range of potential materials to reduce reliance on cobalt, nickel and other more expensive materials.
“DRX materials have enormous compositional flexibility – and this is very powerful because not only can you use all kinds of abundant metals in a DRX cathode,” explained Berkeley Lab scientist Gerbrand Ceder. “But you can also use any type of metal to fix any problem that might come up during the early stages of designing new batteries. That’s why we’re so excited.”
The group’s work with DRX materials is described in the paper Non-topotactic reactions enable high rate capability in Li-rich cathode materials, published in Nature Energy. “We demonstrated significantly improved rate performance in cation-disordered rocksalt cathodes due to a non-topotactic reaction, which stands in contrast to the conventional view that fast Li transport is favored by perfectly topotactic systems,” the group explains. “We believe that well-engineered non-topotacticity provides a new opportunity to design high capacity cathode materials.”
A topotactic reaction is one that alters the crystalline structure of a material, and is the type of reaction that allows today's lithium-ion batteries to charge and discharge.
And though they acknowledge that new battery materials can take 20 years or more to commercialize, the group hopes to accelerate this timeframe with DRX materials, noting that other groups in Europe and Asia have also begun research projects on similar materials. “Advances in battery technologies and energy storage will require continued breakthroughs in the fundamental science of materials,” said Jeff Neaton, Berkeley Lab’s Associate Lab Director for Energy Sciences. “Berkeley Lab’s expertise, unique facilities, and capabilities in advanced imaging, computation, and synthesis allow us to study materials at the scale of atoms and electrons. We are well poised to accelerate the development of promising materials like DRX for clean energy.”

Karsten Nielsen, head of the Vedbæk-based clean power company, told pv magazine a government estimate Denmark will need 71 TWh of renewable energy by 2030 is based on an expectation of 2-2.5 GWp of power-to-gas, or power-to-X (P2X) facilities this decade when, in fact, serious plans for 4.5 GW have already been announced.
The GreenGo chief said the current government prediction “may be underestimated,” in a press release issued by the business yesterday to announce the sale of 360 MW of greenfield-stage solar capacity from GreenGo's 4 GWp, ‘Mermaid portfolio,' Danish solar project pipeline.
GreenGo sold the solar projects to Israeli peer Doral Group Renewable Energy Resources, with the Ramat-Gan based buyer paying €200 million to establish Denmark as its bridgehead for expansion into Europe.
Nielsen told pv magazine the solar projects which have changed hands under the deal have had site control, due diligence and their business cases completed, with permitting applications under way. With Doral having taken ownership, Nielsen said, GreenGo will take the projects through to commissioning on behalf of the new owner.
Quoted in the press release, the GreenGo chief executive said: “The agreement will ensure €200 million-plus in full cycle financing for 360 MW of our rapidly growing Mermaid solar portfolio, under development in Denmark. Denmark remains one of the most interesting solar markets these days, based on … ambitious environmental targets and the rapid expansion of new consumers driven by electrification and green fuels/P2X. We believe that The Climate Partnership of Denmark’s expectation of 71 TWh demand by 2030 may be underestimated, so there is a continued and significant demand for build-out of renewable generation in Denmark.” The Danish government has established 13 climate partnerships for different sectors of industry, including one for energy and utilities.
Doral Energy chief executive Yaki Noyman said: “We are excited to enter into a new partnership with GreenGo on this portfolio of Danish utility scale solar projects. By entering into the Nordics, we continue to diversify our global footprint. It's the natural next step for our planned expansion in Europe. We look forward to contribute to accelerating the energy transition in Denmark with this portfolio.”

New research from the U.K.'s Faraday Institution has suggested ultrasonic delamination could offer a fast, sustainable approach. Not only is the technique apparently quicker and more eco-friendly than hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical processes, but researchers say it could also yield higher-purity materials.
The key to unlocking battery recycling lies in reclaiming active materials from the cathodes, which contain the bulk of a device's precious metals. For instance, it is the cathodes which contain the nickel, manganese and cobalt which give NMC batteries their initialism.
Circular manufacturing has been one of the focuses of pv magazine‘s UP Initiative. We looked at whether adopting circular approaches could create a competitive edge and reap financial and reputational rewards, in addition to investigating what is already being done in the solar industry. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
Those components are glued in a porous layered film 200 μm thick onto copper and aluminum foils – the current collectors – using a special binder. Commonly used binders include polyvinylidene difluoride, mixed carboxymethyl cellulose, and styrene-butadiene rubber.
Recyclers typically shred batteries and treat them with fire or aqueous solvents to recover such precious metals, with attendant energy consumption and toxic waste drawbacks.
Researchers from the universities of Birmingham and Leicester, working under Faraday Institution battery recycling research project ‘ReLiB', however, have suggested a new mode of recycling. They published their findings in the paper Lithium-ion battery recycling using high-intensity ultrasonication, in Green Chemistry.
The team used a commercial ultrasonic system with a 20mm sonotrode, operating at 20 kHz with a power of up to 2,200 W. At that frequency and power, vapor-filled cavitation bubbles formed randomly, oscillating heavily and expanding before collapsing again. Bursting at the surface of the active components, the cavitation bubbles' blasts were stronger than the polymeric binder, resulting in complete delamination of the current collector.
“This novel technique works in the same way as a dentist's ultrasonic descaler, breaking the adhesive bonds between the coating layer and the substrate,” said Andrew Abbott, from the University of Leicester, who led the research. “It is likely that the initial use of the technology will use production scrap from battery manufacturing facilities as the feedstock and feed recycled material straight back into the battery production line, possibly at the same site. This could be a real step-change in battery recycling.”
For the new process, the electrode is submerged in a solution of de-ionized water and moved past the, similarly immersed, sonotrode at a distance of less than 3mm. It takes around ten seconds to clean an electrode sheet using the method, the academics found, translating into an improvement of the amount of material that can be processed in a given time by a factor of around 100.
Keep volume low or muted when watching
 
The researchers retrieved 99.5% of the active materials of the anode and cathode in the experiment, with the remainder comprising particles of less than 3 μm – too small for filtration recovery. The researchers assumed those particles were carbon black additives. By comparison, current hydrometallurgical processes using sulfuric acid solutions achieve a recovery efficiency of around 67% of active materials.
The academics said the efficacy of ultrasonic delamination is dependent on the binder used but modifying the pH of the solution, and potentially adding wetting agents to the process, could optimize it for any binder.
The team from the English Midlands said ultrasonic recycling would cost $0.10 per 150 gram of recovered electrode material but may require more expensive pre-treatment as the batteries need to be disassembled very carefully and the fully intact electrode sheets fed into the ultrasonic device. However, added the researchers, 5-20% of battery waste comes as production scrap, which needs no disassembly. For that sort of application, ultrasonic recycling is already suitable, according to the Faraday Institution team. The researchers have filed for a patent for their technique. 
The researchers had published a separate paper in Green Chemistry in October, describing how battery manufacturers could apply a ‘design-for-recycling-approach,' featuring comprehensive labeling, easy-to-open structures, and solid busbars to enable robots to perform dangerous disassembly. The paper also advocated connecting cells in a bulk structure rather than multiple modules. That has already been realized with cell-to-pack and blade battery devices which have been brought to market, albeit primarily with the aim of improving the capacity and power of lithium-iron-phosphate products.

Germany saw the addition of 403.1 MW of new PV capacity in May, according to the latest figures from federal network agency the Bundesnetzagentur.
This compares to 691.4 MW in April this year and 446 MW in May 2020. The newly installed solar power generation capacity for the first four months of this year was 2,448.3 MW. In the same period a year earlier, this capacity stood at around 1,927 MW.
Of the monthly new additions, 295 MW was represented by PV installations built outside the tender scheme for projects ranging in size from 300 kW to 10 MW.
A significant decline in new PV installations was registered in the segment of rooftop projects with a capacity of 300 kW to 750 kW that, prior to the reform of the German renewable energy law enacted at the end of 2020, were entitled to receive a feed-in tariff, and which have now been included in the project categories that must participate in tenders.
The Bundesnetzagentur also reported that in May, ground-mounted PV plants with a combined capacity of 108 MW were grid connected.
The cumulative capacity of all subsidized PV systems in Germany reached 55.9 GW at the end of May.
The federal network agency also published new compensation rates which will begin in July. The monthly decrease of solar subsidies remains at 1.4% while fixed feed-in tariffs for rooftop systems will range between €0.0747/kWh and €0.0568/kWh, depending on size.

The scientists have tried to show that recycling strategies could improve sustainability and energy payback times for PV modules, given the current pace of technological development. Energy payback refers to the time it takes for solar panels to generate the same amount of energy that was used to manufacture them.
The research team said that most scientists are currently working on perovskite cell performance and the well-known issue of thermal stability, which needs to be improved if the technology is to reach mass production.
“However, the perovskite modules' energy packback time is less relevant to the stability issue,” researcher Fengqi You told pv magazine. “We found perovskite modules typically last longer than their energy payback time.”
According to the research group, proper recycling strategies could substantially improve the environmental performance of new perovskite solar cells.
“We had taken lead into account in our analysis,” You said. “It is very important to consider it due to the health and environmental concerns, but we should also keep other toxic components in mind in this process.”
In the proposed approach, lead is not expected to be recycled, but rather “treated” through selective dissolution, he noted.
“We are aware of the importance of further developing technologies to better treat and recycle lead from the perovskite cells and we have an ongoing project on both technology development and systems analysis looking into this issue,” You said.
The academics made a distinction between laboratory-scale modules based on niche materials and panel prototypes that may be close to industrial production. They identified six device architectures and performed life cycle assessments (LCAs) for both material replacement and recycling. The six categories include: panels with electron transport layer (ETL) based on Lanthanum (La)-doped BaSnO3 (LBSO) perovskite; modules with charge transport layers made of metal oxide; devices fabricated with mixed cation halide perovskite; defect-engineered panels; products fabricated with a a Tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) layer; and semi-transparent modules.
According to the analysis, recycled perovskite solar cells could offer 72.6% lower primary energy consumption and a 71.2% reduction in carbon footprints. The best recycled perovskite cell architecture could see an energy payback time of about one month, with a carbon footprint as low as 13.4 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent output per kWh of electricity produced, the research group claimed.
“Without recycling, the energy payback time and carbon footprint of new perovskite solar cells show a range of 70 days to 13 months, and 27.5 to 158.0 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent throughout their life cycles,” they said.
These values compare to an energy payback period of 1.3 to 2.4 years for crystalline silicon modules. Their initial carbon footprint was estimated at 22.1 grams to 38.1 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per kilowatt-hour of output.
“Recycling makes perovskites outcompete all other rivals,” said researcher Xueyu Tian.
The researchers presented their findings in “Life cycle assessment of recycling strategies for perovskite photovoltaic modules,” which was recently published in Nature Sustainability.

This performance, according to the scientists, was achieved by applying a novel charge-reinforced, ion-selective (CRIS) membrane to a polysulfide-iodide redox flow battery built by the same research team in 2016. “Sulphur-based redox flow batteries adopting a commercial ion-selective membrane are compromised by the crossover and precipitation of active materials, leading to a rapid capacity decay and poor lifetime, and its application in large scale energy storage fails to be effective,” they emphasized.
The membrane was fabricated with a polymer-bound carbon and placed onto commercial Nafion membrane N117 to keep the two electrodes apart. Nafion membranes are proton-conductive polymer films that are used in redox flow batteries to prevent a problem known as “crossover,” which occurs during charging and recharging when battery electrolyte components cross the membrane in the battery cell, thus causing capacity losses that can reach up to 50%.
“The absorption of negatively charged species in porous carbon has strengthened the negative charge of the membrane and reduced the loss of active materials, which dramatically increased the stability and the lifetime of batteries,” the scientists said, referring to the use of the CRIS membrane.

The redox flow battery also exhibited a capacity decay rate of just 0.005% per day for 1,200 cycles, and a lifetime with over 2,000 hours' cycling, which the academics said corresponds to approximately three months. For comparison, a device built exclusively with commercial membrane N117 has a lifetime of 160 hours' cycling, or 6.7 days.
“Under the condition in which the energy storage device with a new battery continuously operated and discharged for more than 15 hours, the surprising result yielded, in turn, a levelized cost of storage (LCOS) for this system which is competitive with other state-of-the-art redox flow techniques for long-duration energy storage applications,” the scientists concluded. “This approach can be universally applied in other redox flow batteries using sulphur-bromine or sulphur-iron materials, and in organic redox flow batteries, which goes further, to fulfill a high stability of cycling.”
The novel membrane is described in the study Polysulfide-based redox flow batteries with long life and low levelized cost enabled by charge-reinforced ion-selective membranes, published in nature energy.

Charging points across the company's network will slow their rate when the grid frequency is too low and ramp when it is high, Tennet said on its website this month.
Tennet said the EV charging business has reassured customers its smart charging algorithm will ensure nobody experiences any “significant impact on the charging experience,” and will be assured “of a full charge when they need it.”
The frequency containment reserve service offered by NewMotion will be equivalent to the energy consumption of 1,000 households, said Tennet, with the smart chargers able to react to frequency variation “within seconds,” a rate up to 600% faster than gas ‘peaker' power stations which would be fired up to provide the same facility, according to the Dutch electricity transmission system operator.

Imagine a city where towering buildings covered in glass windows surreptitiously harvest energy from every corner of the non-visible light spectrum to provide occupants with both a completely clear view and clean energy.
Well, you aren’t the first to imagine such a future. Solar windows have fascinated scientists and engineers for almost half a century. The trick of solar windows is that they need to absorb non-visible light rays, like the UV spectrum, but leave the visible spectrum untouched. They then need to convert that non-visible light into a longer wavelength, trap it inside the window, and guide it to the edge, where a solar panel is ready and waiting, embedded in the window’s frame.
Creating a solar window without any optical distortions or color is one thing. But the real sticking point is creating one that is actually scalable and able to be mass-produced using normal industry manufacturing processes.
“Those are the difficulties but we’ve overcome them already,” ClearVue Technologies Executive Chairman Victor Rosenberg told pv magazine Australia.
ClearVue Technologies now has an industry-standard, 3.5 x 1.6-meter solar window that can harvest light with 3.3% efficiency. It delivers a minimum of 30 watts per square meter, while maintaining 70% transparency.
ClearVue Technologies aims to boost that efficiency by up to 5% over the next 18 months with the help of researchers at the ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science. Three of the center’s researchers are currently developing nanoparticles to transfer non-visible light rays in ways the scientists described to pv magazine Australia as something of a “breakthrough.”
ClearVue Technologies is far from the only company in the world developing solar windows, but Rosenberg believes they are the only ones with a completely clear and industry-sized window on the market. Rosenberg said the ambition is to integrate solar windows into the construction industry, where they could be used in office blocks, skyscrapers, bus shelters, airports, and greenhouses.  “Wherever you see glass,” Rosenberg said.
The company is a partner of the ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science. “Our contribution will essentially be ‘souping up’ the window they are already developing,” researcher Nick Kirkwood told pv magazine Australia.
Quantum yields
Nanoparticles, or “quantum dots,” have really been solar window’s missing step, preventing the vision of a clear solar window from becoming a cold, hard reality.
“Making very high quality nanoparticles is a relatively recent development, having the control over these synthetic methods to make them well,” Kirkwood said.
The job of nanoparticles is to absorb the light of the sun and then re-emit it inside the window at a different wavelength. The first part of that job, the absorption, is called the “quantum yield.” It refers to the percentage of photons the nanoparticles emit relative to how much they absorb – the higher the number, the more is emitted.
Alice Chen is leading Exiton’s nanoparticle research for ClearVue, building on the work of her colleague, Tim Warner. She has managed to get her nanoparticles to reach a quantum yield of 80%, but that number tends to drop down to around 60% when scaled.
“These are really chemical reactions. We cook up these nanoparticles in beakers in our lab and so we can vary the temperatures and the times and what we add in – and then scaling that up is an art form,” said Kirkwood.
The second job of the nanoparticles is to re-emit the sucked-in light at a different wave length, known as a “stokes shift.” Again, the bigger the stokes shift, the better. You don’t want one nanoparticle to spit out light only for its neighboring nanoparticle to suck it right back up. Rather, you want all the other nanoparticles to ignore it, letting it refract along unimpeded to the side of the window. Here Chen has had another win, achieving a “breakthrough” gap between the absorbed and emitted lightwaves.
The sun’s re-emitted light is then “wave guided” to the edges of the window. How this part works is really in the same principle as an optical fiber. As long as the angles are quite flat, it will keep bouncing.
But, of course, there’s a snag. The angle at which light is re-emitted is always random, so there’s a chance it will just go straight back out the way it came. Generally you lose about 25% of the light hitting a window.
“This is one of the challenges we have to work with,” Kirkwood said.
While nobody has yet figured out a way to engineer chaos out of the universe, researcher Tim Warner has been looking into the effects of changing the nanoparticles’ shape and how this effects the angle light re-emits. If you use a nanoparticle that’s shaped like a rod, rather than a sphere, you have more control over which way the light is going to go, Warner explained.
This little kernel of knowledge hasn’t been integrated into the work the center has been doing with ClearVue yet, because they haven’t managed to get their rod-shaped nanoparticles transparent. But it’s certainly possible, bringing paths to higher efficiency well into view.
“It’s just this process of communication and iterative improvements until it works,” Kirkwood said.

The system was acquired in May by Arervon, a unit of global asset manager Capital Dynamics, together with infrastructure developer S&B USA Energy. Capital Dynamics owns 51% of the project and S&B USA holds the remaining 49%.
Electricity from the site is supplied to Southern California Edison under the terms of a 20-year purchase and sale agreement. The project was developed by Strata Clean Energy.
The system uses 142 Megapacks, which is Tesla’s utility-scale battery storage product. It also will use a battery storage performance management platform from Power Factors.
The decision to build the Saticoy battery came after local residents and community leaders helped stop plans for a proposed gas peaker plant. Arevon completed the project in nine months. Energy stored on the site can power the city of Oxnard for four hours or all of Ventura County for 30 minutes.
