In addition, two combined heat and power plants with 4000 series mtu hydrogen engines convert hydrogen into electricity, which will be fed into the supply network of the future container terminal or into the public grid. “The waste heat is used for process heat or for heating buildings in and around the port,” it added. Duisport is working with several partners to build a hydrogen-based supply network by 2023.
German energy company RWE signed a contract with professional services firm Jacobs to investigate the production and supply of green hydrogen at the Pembroke Power Station site in Wales. “The study will take four months, completing in March 2022, and include investigations into the feasibility of initially installing a 100 megawatt (MW) electrolyser to produce green hydrogen from local and grid connected renewable energy,” the company said Friday, adding that the project could grow to several gigawatts in scale. Linked to floating offshore wind in the Celtic Sea, it would be one of the UK’s largest green hydrogen plants in development.
The European Commission has adopted a set of legislative proposals to decarbonize the EU gas market by facilitating the uptake of low carbon gases, including hydrogen. “One of the main aims is to establish a market for hydrogen, create the right environment for investment, and enable the development of dedicated infrastructure, including for trade with third countries,” the European Commission said Wednesday. “The market rules will be applied in two phases, before and after 2030, and notably cover access to hydrogen infrastructures, separation of hydrogen production and transport activities, and tariff setting.” The Commission is creating a new governance body, the European Network of Network Operators for Hydrogen (ENNOH), to promote a dedicated hydrogen infrastructure, cross-border coordination and interconnector network construction, and elaborate on specific technical rules. According to an analysis by the Florence School of Regulation (FSR), ENNOH will be in charge of writing relevant network codes as well as union-wide, non-binding ten-year network development plans (TYNDPs) for the hydrogen sector. More importantly, as written by FSR, hydrogen interconnection projects will now be eligible to apply for funding if they fall within the scope of the wider TYNDPs of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG). The hydrogen sector will have to respect the unbundling principle stated in the Third Energy Package. The proposal includes temporary exemptions through the end of 2030. FSR also reports that renewable and low carbon hydrogen will receive a 75% discount from various entry and exit tariffs as per Article 16 of the Gas Regulation, while blends of up to 5% hydrogen volume into natural gas flows will be accepted and facilitated at cross-border points from October 2025. According to other analysts, a clear definition and a certification process for low-carbon hydrogen are still needed.
Research by Oregon State University into the design of catalysts has reportedly shown that hydrogen can be cleanly produced with much greater efficiency and at lower cost than is possible with current commercially available catalysts. “An active phase of a catalyst based on amorphous iridium hydroxide exhibited efficiency 150 times that of its original perovskite structure and close to three orders of magnitude better than the common commercial catalyst, iridium oxide,” the American university wrote last week. Zhenxing Feng, the chemical engineering professor who led the research, said the advances in catalysts for green hydrogen production can help slash costs. “We found at least two groups of materials that undergo irreversible changes that turned out to be significantly better catalysts for hydrogen production,” Feng said. “This can help us produce hydrogen at $2 per kilogram and eventually $1 per kilogram.”
Raymond Carlsen, the CEO of Norwegian renewable energy company Scatec, met on Wednesday with Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to discuss plans for large-scale seawater desalination, hydrogen and ammonia production based on renewable power in the country. The aim is to develop Egypt into a renewable hub for the region. The large-scale green ammonia manufacturing facility will be located in the Suez Canal Economic Zone. Carlsen described the company's involvement in the project “a key milestone in the implementation of Scatec’s Power-to-X strategy. We are very proud to be partnering again with the Egyptian government to turn Egypt into a green ammonia hub for export, leveraging the Suez Canal strategic location and the support of the country’s leadership for green initiatives.” Scatec recently announced plans for a 100 MW green hydrogen plant in the Mediterranean country. Also this week, Israeli authorities announced funding for hydrogen technology in the country.
The Norwegian government is providing NOK 1 billion (€98.3 million) in funding to three maritime sector hydrogen projects led by Yara Norge, Tizir Titanium & Iron (TTI) and Horisont Energi, government agency Enova announced Friday. “These projects contribute to an investment in the development of solutions for hydrogen for industrial purposes in Norway, with the potential for spreading technology and learning globally,” said Enova CEO Nils Kristian Nakstad. Yara Norge, which will receive up to NOK 283 million, will carry out a demonstration project for the production of ammonia and fertilizers based on renewable energy. Tizir Titanium & Iron (up to NOK 261 million) will develop a demonstration project to use hydrogen instead of coal to reduce ilmenite at a smelter in Tyssedal. Horisont Energi (up to NOK 482 million) will establish ammonia production from natural gas with carbon capture near Hammerfest in the northern Norwegian region of Finnmark.
Ukraine wants to become a leader in hydrogen production with the support of the European Union. “Our country is … ready to become a leader in the development of hydrogen energy, which will allow it to gain full energy independence and achieve climate neutrality,” the Ukrainian president's office announced on its website Wednesday following the sixth Eastern Partnership Summit in Brussels. The country also wants to promote the modernization of checkpoints and infrastructure upgrades, and the digital transformation of the energy system. “In all these projects, Ukraine counts on the support of the EU and international financial institutions,” said President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
Iveco, a subsidiary of Italian-American corporation CNH Industrial, has signed a memorandum of understanding to develop hydrogen mobility in Europe with Paris-based industrial gas business Air Liquide. “Both partners will dedicate means and resources to study the roll-out of heavy-duty fuel-cell electric long-haul trucks coupled with the deployment of a network of renewable or low-carbon hydrogen refuelling stations along the main trans-European transport corridors,” Iveco said Tuesday. “In parallel, both companies will jointly promote initiatives to encourage hydrogen mobility by involving all stakeholders along the entire value-chain.” The company is already active in the hydrogen sector, with partnerships in several countries, including a collaboration with Nikola in Ulm, Germany. Meanwhile, Reuters reported that French auto supplier Faurecia will decide next year whether to build an industrial site for hydrogen tanks in the United States to supply fuel cell electric vehicles, while automotive manufacturing Stellantis is starting limited production of commercial vans from Peugeot, Citroen and Opel.

The association, however, expects a rebound in 2022, for which around 75 GW of new PV capacity is now being projected. The CPIA also revealed that polysilicon production in China this year could reach 360,000 MT, which would be 24.1% more than in 2020, while wafer production is expected to increase by 54% to 165 GW. Moreover, solar cell and module shipments for 2021 were estimated at 147 and 130 GW with growth of 55% and 59%, respectively.
Solar manufacturer China Shuifa Singyes yesterday announced a strategic cooperation agreement with state-owned energy company China Power International Development Ltd to develop 5 GW of solar, smart energy, energy saving and low carbon construction as well as wind power projects. Hydrogen was also mentioned as part of a tie-up that will see China Power buy equipment from China Shuifa Singyes for projects that will include use of a 400 MW solar farm in the village of Zhonghe, in Chenzhou, Hunan, for a “PV plus” industrial facility.
Solar panel glassmaker Xinyi Solar is planning to address the shortage of module material polysilicon by setting up its own RMB 6 billion (US$942 million), 60,000-tons-per-year production line in the Yunnan city of Qujing. The project will be managed by a joint venture in which float glass maker Xinyi Glass – whose majority shareholders also control Xinyi Solar – will hold a 48% stake, with Xinyi Solar holding 52% and having the new Xinyi Silicon JV as a subsidiary. Under the terms of the deal, announced yesterday, Xinyi Solar will commit a maximum RMB 1.7 billion (US$267 million) to the project and Xinyi Glass up to RMB 1.6 billion (US$251 million). The remaining funds will be sought externally. The project is also receiving administrative, land and permitting support from Qujing's municipal government. The two Xinyi businesses said the facility could eventually be scaled up to 200,000 tons. The two-year construction period for the site is expected to begin within 60 days of land permits being obtained.
Solar manufacturer Longi reduced the prices of all its wafers via an update on the company website. Its G1 products, measuring 158.75 mm, now cost RMB 5.85 (US$0.91) per piece, down 5.6%, while 166 mm M6 wafers are 5.4% cheaper, at RMB 5.03. The price of 182 mm M10 wafers has fallen 5.6% to RMB 5.85 per piece. In late November, Longi began reducing wafer prices for the first time in the past 18 months. Two days later, on Dec 2, China's second-largest wafer supplier, Zhonghuan Semiconductor, significantly lowered its wafer prices.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/17/solar-for-hydroponics/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,QATAR",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 17, 2021",Solar for hydroponics,"A Chinese-Qatari research group has assessed the potential of integrating PV power generation with hydroponic farms (SAHFs), which are a kind of horticultural crops that do not use soil and utilize mineral nutrient solutions in an aqueous solvent, usually in greenhouses or closed spaces.
“Hydroponic systems provide water-efficient food production but they are not an energy-efficient solution,” the scientists explained. “This is because they require electricity for heating and cooling, ventilation, irrigation, LED lighting, and other horticultural practices to maintain the hydroponic farm operations in controlled environments.”
The scientists investigated, in particular, how a multi-period, electricity-intensive hydroponic crop production system may be coupled to a PV system under different incentive policies such as feed-in tariff (FIT) programs, rebate schemes, net metering and improving electricity tariff (IET) mechanisms, which consist of simply raising electricity prices for consumers or reducing existing subsidies to the electricity price.
Their approach considered various factors impacting PV system efficiency, including environmental factors, the type of solar array, and the electricity demand from the SAHF. A series of experiments were conducted assuming SAHF operations in Qatar. This framework should provide SAHF developers with enough information to ascertain if a PV system should be installed and which type of solar modules should be used, as well as for identifying optimal sizing and capacity.

For the business case in Qatar, the scientists took into account a 1200 m2 hydroponic farm containing 60 growing trays with an area of 10 m2 each, and an overall 600 m2 are used for growing. The farm has an estimated cost of $4,984 per tray, with the interest rate being assumed to be 2.5%. Electricity and water tariffs were assumed to be $0.036/kWh and $0.0015/L, respectively. Four crops such as tomato, cucumber, lettuce and pepper, as well as six types of PV systems were considered. One-at-a-time (OAT) sensitivity analysis was used to identify the best project configuration under the four different incentive schemes.
The incentive threshold under the IET policy was found to be $0.0425/kWh, while for feed-in tariffs and net metering the threshold was $0.0063/kWh and $0.027/kWh, respectively. For the rebate scheme, a minimum rebate of 14.90% was considered necessary.
The scientists explained that the IET scheme is the most effective in pushing farmers to resort to solar, although it is the more expensive for them, while feed-in tariffs and rebates are indicated an ideal solution for solar hydroponics farms with limited size. “For the hydroponic farmers, once it is profitable to engage in solar energy generation and the right type of PV system is selected, the best strategy is to take full advantage of the available space to maximize the PV system capacity if the surplus electricity can be sold to the grid or other entities,” they emphasized. “The profit of the SAHF is more sensitive to the subsidy levels of the surplus FIT and IET than other policy parameters, while the outputs of the farm show insensitivity to all the subsidies.”
The proposed model was described in the paper “Decisions on design and planning of solar-assisted hydroponic farms under various subsidy schemes,” published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. The research group comprises scientists from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in China and the Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar.

“The availability of Eskom-owned land to near-ready projects will remove a significant barrier to investment, and go a long way to resolving the well documented power crisis in the country, which is faced with an urgent and critical need for additional generation capacity,” Eskom said in a press release. “The land will be available for lease in a competitive bidding process, initially in Mpumalanga province, and will be offered to the private sector for purposes of generating electricity from renewable technologies for own consumption or for sale to third parties.”
According to Eskom, the bidding criteria were designed to prioritize projects with large size and speed of delivery.
Selected developers will be offered a 20-year lease contract and the possibility of deploying solar parks with a capacity of up to 100 MW. Eskom will also offer IPPs its nearest connection points for the planned renewable energy projects. The province of Mpumalanga, on the other hand, has the strongest transmission and distribution infrastructure, as it hosts most of Eskom's coal power plants.
South Africa‘s government raised in August the licensing threshold for embedded generation projects from 1 MW to 100 MW. The new measure – Schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act – exempts developers from applying for a license but they will be required to register with the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA). “The amendment allows generators to wheel electricity through the transmission grid, subject to wheeling charges and connection agreements with the relevant transmission or distribution licence holders,” Eskom said in its latest press release.
Eskom last year took its first steps to “repurpose” its coal power plants and in November secured funds to finance repurposing of coal-fired power stations due for decommissioning over the next 15 years. Meanwhile, the fifth round of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program (REIPPPP) concluded last week has shown that large-scale wind and solar power plants are already able to outperform coal in the country.

The solar park is expected to generate 7,000 MWh per year and operate in combination with the hydropower plant. “It was located in a part of the dam that does not affect the operations of the hydropower plant,” Albania's Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy said in a statement.
“Vau i Dejës will be turned into an integrated energy park for the production of green resources,” said minister Belinda Balluku, noting that the dam may also host floating PV arrays and wind farms in the future.
KESH is currently developing a 12.9 MW floating PV plant at a reservoir on the Drin River near Vau i Dejës. The €13.9 million plant has been planned since December 2018 and would be the largest floating project in the Western Balkans. The generated power is planned to be sold on the local spot market
The utility runs three hydropower plants with a combined generation capacity of 1.3 GW at the Drin River Cascade and provides around 80% of the nation’s generation capacity.

NPC Incorporated said the French company's unit Envie 2E Aquitaine would use the equipment at its waste treatment facility in Bordeaux. “Envie will utilize our disassembly equipment to dismantle PV panels and then cooperate with Rosi, a French company that developed recycling processes allowing to separate and recover metals such as silver and high purity silicon from the PV cells,” it further explained. 
The provided equipment is claimed to enable the reuse of frames, junction boxes, intact broken glass, solar cells and ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) sheets.
The fully automated solar module disassembly line combines a 10m x 2m × 5.5m glass separator, a 2.5m x 1.7m x 1.5m frame separator and a 17.4m x 1.9m junction box separator. It has an annual capacity of 28 MW and is said to enable complete separation of glass and aluminum as well as cell and wiring material.
The line is based on heat blade cutting technology operating at 300°C that the manufacturer says can separate the module components without crushing them.
The glass separator is able to process both broken and unbroken panels. The machine presses the panel with a metal plate from the top and the panel slides to the heated blade, which in turn separates the cells and EVA sheet from the glass. This process takes around 90 seconds per unit and is also applicable to modules with backsheets.
Frame and junction box separations are performed, in this order, by the other two machines in a 40-second process per panel. “It is compact and lightweight equipment, so there is a cost advantage,” a company's spokesperson told pv magazine.
The company claims to have disassembled around 25,000 modules at the end of their lifecycle with this equipment to date.

Peruvian consultancy Energy Partners has selected EDF Renewables, the renewable energy arm of French energy giant EDF, to develop, build and operate a 100 MW/100 MWh solar-plus-storage plant aimed at providing electricity to the city of Iquitos, the largest metropolis in the Peruvian Amazon.
EDF Renewables secured a 20-year PPA for the project from local utility Electro Oriente. The French company said the facility would begin delivering power in 2026 at a more competitive price than diesel.
The hybrid plant will be connected to a microgrid system that currently provides electricity to the 550,000 inhabitants of Iquitos and will supply between 160 and 200 GWh per year. This will prevent the burning of at least 50% of the fossil fuels that are currently used to generate electricity in the region.
EDF Renewables has also signed an agreement to supply electricity to the town of Requena, in the Loreto Region in northeastern Peru, for a 20-year period.

Canada-based building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) module manufacturer Mitrex Integrated Solar Technology released a 350 W solar roof panel. The modules are designed to mimic the look of a shingled roof, retaining significant power output while considering the aesthetics of the home.
The panels feature hidden framing that allows for visual integration with non-solar roof sections, and customizable tempered glass in four different shades, including slate and shingle-like designs. The Solar Roof is also integrated with an anti-soiling coating.
The black asphalt mono module offers up to 300 W and open-circuit voltage up to 1000V, while the black slate mono module produces up to 350 W nominal max power and 1000V. The modules measure 80”x40” and have a temperature coefficient of –0.36% per Celsius. 
Mitrex Solar Roof panels are manufactured in Ontario, Canada and are backed by a 25-year warranty. The company said the roof-integrated PV can be installed using the same methods of traditional panel installation.
This product release comes on the heels of Mitrex’s release of its most powerful solar panel to-date: a two-module 790 W panel. 
The panel is built of two 395 W modules and contains 144 monocrystalline cells with 22.5% efficiency. The 790W panel is coated with patented anti-reflective technology, which involves color-treating the glass through pigments that are fused into the glass itself.
Mitrex also makes smaller solar modules, as well as PV facades, solar cladding, solar glass and BIPV systems.

The defunct Wallerawang Power Station has moved a step closer to becoming a sustainable energy hub with owner Greenspot lodging a development application and environmental impact statement with the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Planning, Industry and Environment to build an estimated $400 million battery energy storage system (BESS) at the site.
The privately-owned developer is also seeking to build a new transmission line that would connect the big battery to TransGrid’s existing 330 kV Wallerawang substation.
Greenspot, which acquired the former power station site from EnergyAustralia in September 2020, said construction of the energy storage system is expected to begin in early 2022. It is anticipated the big battery, dubbed the Wallerawang 9 Battery, will be fully operational by summer 2023/24, making it one of the earliest examples of how new and sustainable economies can be born from the retirement of coal-fired power stations.
“We’re focused on delivering a shovel-ready site and we are aiming to work with leading energy market players to deliver a successful example of what’s possible as Australia transitions to renewable energy,” Greenspot chief executive officer Brett Hawkins said.
Greenspot, which was established with the objective of repurposing stranded fossil fuel assets, said the big battery is aligned with the state government’s electricity strategy and will provide enabling infrastructure for expanding the renewable energy industry in NSW, particularly in and around the Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).
“We’re excited about the project’s potential to deliver storage, firming and other energy services to facilitate the introduction of more renewables into the NSW market,” Hawkins said.
Greenspot said the battery will also be a significant enabler for the transformation of the site into a multi-use hub for industry, providing a stable, reliable and cost-effective energy source for the future redevelopment.
It is anticipated the battery project will require only 40 hectares of the approximately 450ha site, which has sat idle since the coal-fired power station was decommissioned in 2014, with Greenspot aiming to attract industrial, agribusiness and manufacturing businesses, serving to generate sustainable economic activity.
“The lodgement of the development application for the Wallerawang 9 Battery is an important early marker in repurposing the site for the next chapter of success,” Hawkins said.
“There is much at stake as we look to reinstate the power station as the heartbeat of the community here. We’re looking forward to working together with all stakeholders to generate renewed business activity and sustainable employment opportunities for the region.”
The project is the second major battery slated for the region with French renewables developer Neoen earlier this year filing planning documents for a 500 MW/1,000 MWh big battery to be also built at Wallerawang.
Construction of the Great Western Battery is expected to begin in 2022 with Neoen indicating the battery could be operational by 2023.
The lodging of the DA for the Wallerawang 9 Battery follows the recent demolition of two 175 metre chimney stacks and a boiler house at the power station site.

The Senate Finance Committee released its draft of the Build Back Better (BBB) infrastructure bill, and in it are up-front incentives for the domestic manufacturing of solar PV wafers, cells, modules, trackers, and inverters. Committee chair Ron Wyden (D-OR) is expected to lead conversations as the committee holds bipartisan meetings on the bill.
Included in the bill is an incentive for the manufacture of thin-film PV or crystalline PV cells. The incentive would pay $0.04 per watt DC capacity of the cell. PV wafers would be offered $12 per square meter, and solar-grade polysilicon is offered $3 per kilogram U.S.-made solar modules are offered an incentive of $0.07 per watt.
Trackers have been added to the bill. Structural fasteners would qualify for $2.28 per kilogram, longitudinal purlins $0.87 per kilogram, and structural fasteners $2.28 per kilogram.
Inverters were also a new addition to BBB. Microinverters, with capacity of 650 W or less can receive $0.11 per watt, while other residential inverters with 20 kW capacity or less are offered $0.065 per watt. Commercial inverters that range between 20 kW and 170 kW would be eligible for an incentive of two cents per watt.
Utility-scale inverters with capacity between 170 kW and 1 MW of capacity would be offered an upfront incentive of $0.015/W if BBB is passed, and central inverters greater than 1 MW in capacity would be eligible for an incentive of $0.025/W.

Incentives are viewed as a way to bring solar manufacturing back onshore. In a recent interview with pv magazine, module producer Maxeon said that it is considering a 3 GW cell production plant in the U.S., but is waiting on a Title XVII loan from the Department of Energy, and the passing of Sen. Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act. If passed, the company said it could begin producing cells in the U.S. as soon as 2023.
Ossoff’s bill would offer tax credits for several steps along the PV supply chain, including for the domestic manufacture of modules, cells, and solar-grade polysilicon, as well as trackers and inverters. The incentives would be available through 2028 with a phase-down over the following two years. On November 19th the bill was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, and it next faces review by the Senate.
