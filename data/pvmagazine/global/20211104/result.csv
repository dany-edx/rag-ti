French Minister of Ecological Transition Barbara Pompili announced a 10-measure plan on Wednesday to accelerate the development of photovoltaics.
Some of the measures were already known and implemented, such as the new feed-in tariff for PV systems up to 500 kW and the obligation to install solar panels on certain kinds of buildings. But the new provisions mainly focus on the use of degraded land and the acceleration of administrative procedures.
“Currently, we are at 12 GW of installed PV capacity, which we need to triple by 2028 and by seven times by 2050,” said the minister. “This is a lot and we want to make the development of photovoltaics a priority wherever possible, without artificializing the land.”
The country's Multi-Year Energy Program (PPE) plans to reach between 35.6 GW and 44.5 GW of solar power in 2028. The ministry is focusing on wastelands, which, according to the minister, represent a potential of 8 GW. In addition, the plan sets a target of 1,000 solar projects on public land by 2025 and in particular, along motorways.
A draft decree will be submitted for public consultation before the end of the year to exempt solar panels on existing buildings and parking lots from environmental assessments. Building permits will no longer be required for small projects.
In addition, the Ministry of Ecological Transition will launch a vast audit in 2022 of the different categories of project promoters to identify new simplification measures. Finally, a decree will soon be published to implement the measure of the climate and resilience law, which offsets grid fee costs for small projects below 500 kW.
Action plan
1. Support for photovoltaics on buildings and degraded land
2. Mandatory solar in warehouses, hangars and carports
3. Regular tenders for large rooftop PV projects and ground-mounted plants on degraded land
4. Install 1,000 solar projects on public land by 2025
5. Improve impacts on biodiversity, soil and landscapes
6. Simplify administrative procedures for small projects
7. Support PV project developers
8. Lower grid fees for small solar projects
9. Support energy communities
10. Create label for solar cities and departments

It has been a tough period for the tracker maker, which cited global logistics headaches and “a shortage of personnel in some countries” as the reason for its net loss of €20 million in the first nine months of the year. At least those losses were stemmed in the last full quarter, with the business shedding only a net €100,000 in the July-to-September window.
Pick up the November edition of pv magazine tomorrow to read about the many software solutions driving the energy transition. From big data and artificial intelligence taking the hard work out of operations and monitoring, to the move toward international standards and a consensus in ensuring electricity networks are secured against cyber attacks and other digital threats; the bits and bytes of software solutions play a complex and central role in the energy system.
The Murcia-headquartered manufacturer – cited as an exemplar of European solar technology balance-of-system production in the jobs report published by trade body SolarPower Europe yesterday – pointed to a signed-contract backlog of orders worth €397 million as a reason for optimism, and said it also had expectations of an eventual pipeline of orders worth €3.05 billion.
The better performance in the last quarter will have been helped along by an order from Florida-based construction company Moss & Associates, which has signed up for enough trackers to kit out 700 MW worth of solar project generation capacity.
Soltec was also keen to highlight the prospects of its Powertis solar project development business, which it said has a 9.1 GW order book including a 722 MW backlog, 1,369 MW of sites at an advanced stage of development, and 2,759 MW of early-stage facilities, plus a further 4,229 MW of “identified opportunities.” Powertis also secured 100 MW of project capacity in the latest Colombian renewable energy auction, the results of which were announced on Tuesday last week.
The full-year figures, however, appear unlikely to make for cheerful reading. Soltec said it expects 2021 revenue of €395-440 million but an EBITDA margin – the amount of operating cash generated for each dollar of revenue – of between 1 and -1% for the year, and that is before any debt interest, taxes and the like are deducted.

The model is based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), which is a decision-making technique that considers multi-dimensional factors and enables the comparison of technologies by combining individual criteria into one overall approach. The model's criteria were outlined with the weighted linear combination (WLC) technique, which is a decision rule for deriving composite GIS maps.
The proposed technique considers a pumped-hydro project's head and elevation difference, the penstock-length distance from the base plant, the site's slopes and slope of the ground surface, the distance to the national grid and road networks, and the soil suitability. It also takes into account constraints such as land use and restrictions.
The model was tested on the whole land of Egypt and, in particular, a buffer zone with a 5km distance around water body surfaces. “This area is bordered by Palestine at the northeast; the Red Sea at the east; Sudan at the south; Libya in the west; and the Mediterranean Sea in the north,” the scientists specified.
The collected datasets were converted to raster data layers and the suitability values ranged from high suitability to low suitability.  The classification values used ranged from one to 10, with 10 being the most suitable for pumped hydro sites. “Sixty-two potential candidates for optimum PHES locations considered as huge national resources were found,” the Egyptian group stated. “The high-suitability sites covered a total area of 652.79km2, with 12 sites mainly concentrated on Aswan governorate, along the River Nile.”
The model was delineated in the paper A GIS model for exploring the water pumped storage locations using remote sensing data, published in The Egyptian Journal of Remote Sensing and Space Science.

South Korea-based photovoltaic manufacturer Hanwha Q Cells has announced in a press release that the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court, in Germany, has upheld a previous decision taken by the Düsseldorf Regional Court to impose a coercive penalty payment against competitors Longi and REC Solar.
“Despite the Regional Court of Düsseldorf’s judgement of June 16, 2020, in which the ruling stated that the defendants were legally obliged to recall specific solar products that have been considered patent-infringing (and since January 30, 2019, were sold via … distribution channels with respect to commercial customers in Germany), Longi and REC – the Higher Regional Court ruled – failed to fully meet the requirements of the recall obligation,” the Korean company said. “Hence, the regional court’s decision to impose each company … pay a penalty for this failure was justified.”
The amount of penalty payment remains unclear.
The patent dispute between the photovoltaic manufacturers dates back to spring 2019. In March 2019, Hanwha Q-Cells filed a patent infringement lawsuit in both Germany and the United States, and shortly afterward in Australia, against Longi, REC and a third defendent, JinkoSolar. According to the company, its three competitors have illegally used its patented technology in their products. In June 2020, the Regional Court of Düsseldorf, in Germany, ruled in favor of Hanwha Q-Cells in the first instance. REC and Longi Solar appealed against the decision, whereupon Hanwha Q-Cells initiated the preliminary enforcement of the decision. In Hanwha Q-Cells' view, Longi Solar and REC, subsequently, did not take sufficient measures to comply with the court-ordered recall obligation, which is why Hanwha applied for a fine.
“The court emphasized in its decision that the debtor of a recall obligation – both Longi and REC – have to make a serious request to their commercial customers to voluntarily return the infringing product,” Hanwha Q Cells went on to say. “If either Longi or REC, in their recall requests, imply that compliance with the recall request is at the discretion of the customer, the debtors have to clearly inform their customers that they are at risk of being directly held responsible by the patent owner to meet the requirements for the recall obligation.”
The judges also ruled that Longi Solar and REC had to submit copies of all letters sent, or a list of recipients, to Hanwha Q-Cells in order to verify compliance with the recall obligation.
The patent dispute between the manufacturers has, meanwhile, also reached the Netherlands. According to information from Hanwha Q-Cells, a court there imposed upon Longi Netherlands Trading B.V. a requirement to refrain from any activity that constitutes patent infringement in the countries in which Hanwha Solutions Corporation is a registered patent holder. That legal dispute, by which Hanwha Q-Cells wants to prevent the distribution of patent-infringing solar modules in European third-party countries, has been swelling since the summer of 2021. At that time, a court in Rotterdam ordered the seizure of a delivery of Longi solar modules. According to the Chinese photovoltaic manufacturer, that seizure was lifted shortly afterwards.
pv magazine asked Longi Solar and REC for a statement on the decision of the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court. We will add this as soon as we have it.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/04/lead-absorbing-encapsulant-for-perovskite-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"NOVEMBER 4, 2021",Lead absorbing encapsulant for perovskite solar cells,"Perovskites are one of the most promising technologies for future high efficiency solar cell concepts, now being investigated by most of the leading cell and module makers. Environmental concerns over the use of water soluble lead in the perovskite materials, however, are one of a few roadblocks holding the technology back from wider commercial adoption.
Though there is plenty of research underway into lead-free perovskite solar cells, these are a way behind in terms of efficiency. And though the amounts of lead contained in a perovskite cell are small, and should remain within the module to be collected at its end-of-life, concerns over possible leakage of lead in an already water soluble form have been enough for researchers to take a closer look at managing the risks.
Scientists at Northern Illinois University (NIU), working alongside the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL), have developed a type of transparent sticky tape, which they say can be applied to a perovskite solar cell, and will absorb any lead that is leaked from it. “Our practical approach mitigates the potential lead-leakage to a level safer than the standard for drinking water,” said NIU Chemistry Professor Tao Xu. “We can easily apply our lead-absorbing materials to off-the-shelf films currently used to encapsulate silicon-based solar cells at the end of their production, so existing fabrication processes for PSCs would not be disrupted.”

The tape solution is described in full in the paper On-device lead-absorbing tapes for sustainable perovskite solar cells, published in nature sustainability. The lead absorbing material is coated onto a film of ethylene vinyl acetate (commonly used to encapsulate various solar cell types) and then evaporated under ambient conditions, and laminated between the glass and electrode layers.
The lead absorbing layer is 5.7 microns thick on the front side and 10 microns thick at the rear, which the group estimates would allow it to absorb almost seven times the amount of lead contained in the entire solar cell. To test this, the group fabricated cells with the encapsulant. These were installed on a rooftop for three months, before being severely damaged with hammers and razor blades, and then submerged in water for seven days. The film was shown to absorb 99.9% of lead leaked from the device, keeping the amount of lead in the water safely below the guidelines for drinking water set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

“This work offers a convenient and industry-ready method to diminish the potential lead leakage from Pb2+ containing perovskites,” the group concluded, “facilitating future commercialization of perovskite-based PV technology.”

With small scale, rooftop PV considerably more employment intensive than big, ground-mounted projects, SolarPower Europe estimated the household solar program in Poland helped drive the equivalent of 91,467 full-time jobs (designated ‘FTE,' or full-time equivalent) in the nation last year, ensuring it was the biggest EU member state solar employer.
While the trade body noted that was also down to cheap labor costs in the country – a factor which also hoisted Greece, with its 24,262 FTE solar workforce to fifth place – the report's authors predicted the planned expiry of Poland's rooftop incentive program will leave the nation with 33,431-101,468 solar jobs in 2025. The variance is explained by the fact the study based expectations on three scenarios: business as usual; full achievement of the ‘European Solar Initiative‘ (ESI) plan to establish 20 GW of polysilicon-to-solar-module annual manufacturing capacity in Europe; and a third, ‘medium' outcome between the two.
Trade tensions, supply chain problems, severe weather and more will be discussed on Tuesday at pv magazine‘s virtual Roundtables USA 2021 event. Join us as solar experts discuss the big issues. For more information and to register free for the event, click here.
Lack of rooftop incentives in 2025, would see Germany – which SolarPower Europe estimated employed 79,018 full-time equivalents in its PV-related workforce last year – rise to the top spot, with somewhere between 104,739 and 167,214 photovoltaic industry employees.
In terms of last year, third-placed Spain was notable for being the only nation in the top seven of Europe's solar employers to have a workforce (40,215 FTE) not largely dependent on the rooftop market. With big-solar-related employment expected to represent a larger share of the whole in 2025 – in part thanks to hoped-for easing of permitting procedures – Spain is expected to fall to fourth place by that point, with a 32,320-60,155 solar workforce.
The SolarPower Europe study – its first jobs publication since 2017, and which it has now promised will be an annual affair – predicted France, which employed an estimated 18,818 in solar last year, would have a 33,624-60,418 solar labor market in 2025. Greece, which employed 24,262 FTE last year, will retain fifth place in 2025, with 26,917-54,250 workers, and the solar jobs number will also rise in the Netherlands, from last year's 27,055 to 27,976-47,288, even if the nation goes down the ranking, from fourth to seventh position. By 2025, the report predicted, Italy, with its 16,874 solar workforce last year, will have been replaced in the top seven by Romania, which will support 15,376-54,635 photovoltaics-linked jobs, thanks again to cheaper labor and a market led by the residential market.
Aside from demonstrating the effectiveness of policy support, the study was used to repeat the call for member state governments to deliver on the ESI solar manufacturing ambition of SolarPower Europe, EU body EIT InnoEnergy and other members of the industrial partnership.
With the bloc supporting 357,000 solar jobs last year, according to the document, that number is expected to rise to 463,000 this year and could hit 1.1 million in 2030, if the EU raises its renewable energy ambition such that clean power supply 45% of final energy consumption – rather than the 40% that marks the current European Commission target – and supports all the solar manufacturing the trade body is calling for.
The report included a roll call of SolarPower Europe members to demonstrate the PV manufacturing knowhow is already present, from German polysilicon maker Wacker through to around 30 European module makers, via newly-arrived ingot producer Norwegian Crystals, PV cell making plans announced by German equipment maker Meyer Burger, and encapsulation materials company Borealis, in Austria. And not forgetting the inverter manufacturers in Germany (SMA), Austria (Fronius), and Italy (Fimer) – and Israeli company SolarEdge‘s Hungarian production unit; German racking businesses Mounting Systems and K2, Spanish tracker giant Soltec, and Switzerland's Stäubli, which provides electrical bridge connectors.
Oxford PV was mentioned on the basis of its budding perovskite solar fab plans in Germany, and Italian energy company Enel was praised for its solar module ambition, with SolarPower Europe broadcasting the message the continent can again compete with Chinese producers.
And with numerous previous renewables-lobby publications blithely reporting the number of new clean energy posts will outweigh job losses in coal mining-dependent regions, SolarPower Europe has at least tried to connect up the dots for a ‘just transition.' The report pointed out decommissioned coal mine sites would be perfect choices to install fields of solar panels, including areas which will flood when pumping ceases, and which can therefore host floating projects.
As yesterday's study noted, EU body the Joint Research Center has estimated Europe's coal regions could host 1,516 GW of renewable energy capacity – and would have a ready and eager workforce on hand to install it.

The quarterly net result was KRW 177.6 billion, up 2,830% year on year and 22% quarter on quarter. The operating result increased 977% from KRW 166.3 billion in the third quarter of 2020 to KRW 194.6 billion in the latest quarter.
OCI said polysilicon sales price rose by around 29% quarter on quarter, while sales dropped by 15% by volume.
“The short–term impact of the surge in metallurgical silicon prices would not be significant thanks to the diversified purchasers and existing raw material inventories,” the manufacturer said. “The Basic Chemicals Division performance has improved with market price increases resulting from the lack of poly-si supply and stable production and continuous cost reduction of a Malaysian plant even in the limited operating environment under Covid-19.”
OCIM Sdn Bhd (OCIMSB), the company's Malaysian unit, began to ramp up the annual production capacity of its polysilicon factory in the Samalaju Industrial Park in Sarawak, Malaysia, by 5,000 metric tons in March.
OCI said tight supply and demand conditions for raw materials and polysilicon will likely continue until the first half of 2022.

The choice of the bifacial architecture is intended at increasing the device's power yield in order to offset the high costs for producing the CdSeTe sub-cell, the scientists explained. According to their theoretical simulations, the monolithic bifacial tandem design can increase the output power density limit of conventional CdSeTe solar modules by up to 50% with a light-color concrete ground with albedo values ranging from 0.1 to 0.3.
The prototype of the cell is claimed to achieve an equivalent bifacial efficiency of more than 20%, with an open-circuit voltage of more than 2 V. The cell can be manufactured with a front contact made of transparent conductive oxides (TCO), a hole transport layer (HTL), a perovskite layer, an electron transport layer, an interconnecting layer, a CdSeTe layer, a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, and a glass cover.
The scientists also said the proposed cell technology can be easily integrated into the industrial production lines of CdSeTe panels, and that it is compatible with wide-bandgap (FA,MA,Cs)Pb(Br1-x,Ix)3 perovskite and narrow-bandgap CdSeTe. “Additional costs of producing perovskite cell component layers on the commercial CdSeTe solar cells are estimated to be less than 15% of the total cost of the current CdSeTe solar modules,” they explained.
The U.S. Department of Energy is supporting the further development of the cell with a $300,000 grant. UToledo has a patent pending for the cell technology.

The average price for an imported monocrystalline PERC module is currently $0.24/W, up 3.95% from the average price registered in August. Greener believes that prices will continue to increase, possibly into 2022.
However, imported volumes continue to grow, despite the rise in prices. The aggregate capacity from January to September 2021, both for modules and inverters, is already 40% higher than it was during the same period in 2020. About 6,641 MW of PV modules have been imported since January and 6,890 MW of inverters.
About 885 MW of inverters were imported in September, making it the strongest month of the year since 1,115 MW in February. Volumes were 42.27% higher than in September 2020 and up 32.1% from August 2021. Larger inverters (above 50.1 kW) accounted for 43% of the total import volume for string technology. Medium-sized inverters represented 20% of the total and small inverters accounted for 37%.
Module import volumes hit 672 MW in September, below the level seen in the first five months of this year, but up 121.5% from September 2020. Monofacial modules accounted for 57.3% of the monthly total and high power modules (above 500 W) accounted for 30%, at 209 MW.

“PV power output is directly driven by meteorological conditions, and its drivers are likely to change in the future.” This statement, a few pages into a new paper by researchers at the University of New South Wales, seems obvious. But its implications as temperatures rise and weather patterns alter due to climate change will inform our expectations of solar output to 2079 and beyond.
The conclusions reached by the paper, “Estimations of future changes in photovoltaic potential in Australia due to climate change,” provide insights into where solar farms could best be located as this century progresses. It is the first study to use high-resolution regional climate projections in Australia to forecast changes in PV potential due to variations in shortwave downwelling radiation, temperature and wind speed; and the first ever to consider the additional impact of changes in cell temperatures.
Shukla Poddar, a doctoral student at the UNSW School of Photovoltaic Energy and Engineering (SPREE) and lead author on the paper, told pv magazine Australia that the most surprising outcome of this research “is the cell temperature effect.” In other words, it’s obvious that changes in irradiation might cause increases or decreases in solar PV output in the decades-distant future, but in fact, ever-increasing ambient temperatures implicit in global warming will also reduce cell efficiency and will likely accelerate the degradation of solar cell.
As UNSW Scientia Professor Martin Green has famously said, “Solar cells would prefer to be operating in a fridge.” Instead, their operating environment is typically hot, and becoming relentlessly hotter. Poddar and co-authors have measured the effect on polysilicon solar cells of temperature rises under a high emissions scenario that projects warming of 3 C to 4 C by 2100.
It’s not that the researchers are pessimists – far from it. But high-resolution climate simulations available from the New South Wales/Australian Capital Territory Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) project used the high-emissions A2 scenario, and the previous study into wind resource by one of Poddar’s co-authors, Jason Evans had also used the NARCliM data. Using the same data, ensures the two studies are relatable, to give an overall picture of how Australia’s renewable resources will fare under climate change.
“When you’re thinking about this work, it serves as a risk management strategy,” a third co-author, Dr Merlinde Kay, told pv magazine Australia. “It describes what could happen in the future and gives people enough time to prepare for what the most extreme outcome could be.”
