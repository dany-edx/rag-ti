TU Wien scientists covalently anchored noble-metal and carbon-free thiomolybdate [Mo3S13]2- clusters onto photoactive metal oxide supports to serve as molecular co-catalysts for photocatalytic water splitting. “This work provides a prime example for the successful heterogenization of an inorganic molecular cluster as a co-catalyst for light-driven HER [hydrogen evolution reaction] and gives the incentive to explore other thio(oxo)metalates,” the team wrote in a recent paper in American Chemical Society. The approach allows the scientists to assess the structure of the clusters with atomic precision, to facilitate a full understanding of the catalytic cycle. The clusters responsible for oxidizing oxygen include cobalt, tungsten, and oxygen, while clusters of sulfur and molybdenum are particularly suitable for creating hydrogen molecules. The researchers were the first to deposit the clusters on a surface made of titanium oxide, where they can act as catalysts for water splitting.
University of Alicante researchers and scientists from the University of Liverpool have identified the presence of surface species at low potentials in the primary fuel cell catalyst, platinum (Pt). They used electrochemical techniques and a spectroscopic technique known as SHINERS (Shell Isolated Nanoparticles for Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy). “The use of SHINERS made it possible to demonstrate the presence of adsorbed OH at potentials more negative than previously thought,” the researchers wrote. They published their findings in Nature Communications. They said the identification of hydroxyl adsorbed at low potentials opens the door to studying the mechanism of many relevant electrochemical reactions.
Duisburg, a massive inland port in Germany, is building a new container terminal on a former coal island. The port will reportedly become climate neutral via a hydrogen-based supply network that is set for operation by 2023. “Our mtu fuel cell solutions for electrical peak load coverage as well as mtu hydrogen heat and power generation station will supply the future terminal with electrical energy and heat in a sustainable way,” said Rolls-Royce Power Systems. The hydrogen-powered mtu fuel cell solutions will supply electrical power as soon as the public grid reaches its limits, while waste heat will partly be used to heat buildings around the port.
CWP has signed a framework agreement with the government of Mauritania to develop a planned 30 GW green hydrogen project. The $40 billion AMAN project will include 18 GW of wind capacity and 12 GW of solar.  It will generate approximately 110 TWh per year at full capacity.
The Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized economies have launched the G-7 Hydrogen Action Pact, a six-action plan to ramp up global markets and supply chains for low-carbon and renewable hydrogen and its derivatives. The G-7 wants to accelerate the adoption of hydrogen and Power-to-X value chains, while developing regulatory frameworks, committing financial resources, and supporting renewable hydrogen in the decarbonization of fossil gas infrastructure. They said they aim to reduce energy imports from Russia, while decarbonizing their economies. 
Advent Technologies and vehicle logistics specialist Neptune Lines have agreed to jointly launch a pilot program to explore the application of fuel cell-based auxiliary power systems.
GP Joule has ordered a 2 MW electrolyzer from H-Tec System to use wind power to produce hydrogen for a filling station in Bremerhaven, Germany.
SFC Energy has received an order of 180 fuel cells from Linc Polska. The deal is reportedly valued at more than EUR 1 million.

Last week, prices of M10 and G12 wafers remained stable at CNY 6.79 and CNY 9.12, respectively. But given the current polysilicon supply glut, they could also increase. In addition, earthquakes in Sichuan province on Wednesday affected three ingot casting factories, with a total capacity of 36.2 GW. In turn, lower production rates could have a negative impact on wafer production and wafer prices.
LDK, a unit of Haiyuan Material, plans to invest CNY 355 million in a 600 MW factory for of n-type heterojunction (HJT) solar cells. It said it chose HJT rather than TOPCon because it doesn't have any PERC capacity that could be directly upgraded to TOPCon. The factory will be built in Xinyu, Jiangxi province.
Flat Glass has announced plans to raise up to CNY 6 billion via a private share issuance on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The company wants to use CNY 4.2 billion of the proceeds for two solar panel glass production projects, together valued at CNY 8.1 billion.
Comtec Solar says it wants to sell off its shuttered wafer factories in Shanghai for CNY 180 million. Shanghai Pudong Zili Color Printing Factory, a pharmaceuticals packaging producer, has reportedly agreed to buy seven factories from the developer.

They have also looked at how such technologies could be used in a range of applications, including building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), solar windows, vehicle-integrated solar, greenhouses, wireless sensors for the Internet of Things (IoT), wearable electronics, floating, and underwater equipment.
“These tuning capabilities in adjustable solar cells cover a multitude of aspects such as bandgap, transparency, color, thermal management, mechanical flexibility, weight, and size,” the scientists said. “Tunable PV can be defined as solar cell technologies that present a manipulation of inherent properties through material design of the functional components and retrofits or via device architecture engineering.”
They described the principles and general criteria of different tuning approaches and presented the most relevant tunable PV device concepts and the most representative realized tunable solar cell techs. They also presented all possible applications that are enabled by tunable PV technologies and for each PV integration scenario, they highlighted the relevant tuning aspects.
“A critical evaluation in the framework of a TRL approach is addressed to discuss the technical maturity across different PV technologies customized for specific integration schemes,” they said.
The researchers focused on the optoelectronic and thermal tuning capabilities of PV devices. In particular, they considered factors such as absorber bandgap, color perception, visible transmission, and thermal management. They presented their findings in “Tunable Photovoltaics: Adapting Solar Cell Technologies to Versatile Applications,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials.

The US consumer market for distributed energy resources (DERs) is on the verge of booming. The Solar Energy Industries Association estimates that nearly 5% of US owner-occupied homes now have rooftop solar. And energy storage is having its moment, with more storage deployed in 2021 than the prior five years combined.
What’s more, solar generation and energy storage are increasingly friendly, with one-third of new behind-the-meter solar systems installed by 2025 expected to incorporate energy storage. Overall, $110 billion is expected to be invested in DERs by 2025.
DERs can provide energy at a lower price than what the grid typically offers.  They do so more cleanly while offering consumers greater resilience during adverse grid events. And despite commercial lenders’ unwillingness to adequately recognize it, DERs are also more widely available and cost-effective than ever. As researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have shown, solar adopters can come from a range of incomes, and financing options are gradually expanding to lower income groups, as well as to those with below-median home values and credit scores.
Much more DER deployment will be needed at scale to meet the Administration’s goal of achieving 100% clean electricity by 2035, and ensuring an equitable transition under its Environmental Justice 40 initiative will require intentional investment. Virtual power plants can catalyze DER deployment at scale and help make affordable, resilient, and clean energy accessible to all Americans.
A VPP is generally considered a connected aggregation of DER technologies – not only solar and battery storage, but increasingly grid-interactive efficient appliances and buildings, electric vehicle charging, and thermal energy storage. Aggregators, utilities, or grid operators, under terms agreed upon with participants, can remotely and automatically adjust DERs in this aggregation to provide clean energy, reliability, and grid services while maintaining customer comfort and productivity.
Through a combination of software and hardware, VPPs not only open the grid to a whole new utility-scale, behind-the-meter supply, but also coordinate disparate DERs into holistic, demand-flexible resources. Operators gain the flexibility to better reduce peak demand and, as a result, defer investment in additional capacity and infrastructure to serve a peak load that is expected to increase as we electrify the nation’s economy. VPP participants can receive compensation for services rendered and all the benefits that come with them. Everyone enjoys greater affordability and performance.
VPPs offer an exciting opportunity to create clean power solutions that are greater than the sum of their parts. The power plants may be virtual, but VPP technology’s potential to democratize the coming clean energy economy will be very real.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/03/australian-prefabricated-solar-array-manufacturer-raises-21-8-million/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 3, 2022",Australian prefabricated solar array manufacturer raises $21.8 million,"From pv magazine Australia
Led by United States-based energy giant AES Corporation and Sydney-headquartered investment management firm Artesian Venture Capital, the capital raise will support 5B’s market expansion, supply and delivery chain development and execution of its technology and product roadmap.
5B said the funding round will also help it to unlock the full potential of its redeployable, modular, prefabricated Maverick solar technology. A single Maverick is a ground-mounted solar array block of up to 90 PV modules, which can be made with any standard framed 60 or 72-cell PV module.
Sydney-based 5B said it has more than 50MW of its Maverick solution deployed across more than 100 sites and five continents, along with an order book of more than 100 MW. It features “plug-and-play” wiring designed for faster, easier and safer on-site deployment ideally suited for mining, commercial and industrial, and large-scale solar power generation.
In May, it set a new speed record for solar deployment with 1.1 MW deployed in a single day by a crew of 10 people at AES’ Andes Solar II B solar farm in Chile’s Atacama Desert. the project was built by 5B’s Latin American deployment partner, SolarMovil, which installed 22 Maverick arrays in a single day, as part of a larger deployment of 219 Mavericks with a total generation capacity of more than 10 MW.
5B CEO Chris McGrath said the achievement is part of what has been a remarkable period of growth for the company. “It has been an incredible couple of years for us, in spite of the state of the world, we have successfully launched our Maverick solution into the United States, Latin America, Europe and India, while building a global supply chain and deployment ecosystem to support this,” he said.
McGrath said 5B is now looking to build upon that foundation, turning to automation and advanced manufacturing across its technology platform. This is expected to drive a further step change in speed and capacity increase, as well as cost reduction, and see 5B break through its first gigawatt of sales.
“Our next generation deployment vehicle for Maverick is going to take our current solar deployment record, and 10x it again,” he said. “This will completely remove the speed of deployment as a constraint in solar projects. The challenge will then become other parts of the project development, supply chain, and build cycle.”
The capital raise comes just months after 5B announced a AUD 33.4 million tech innovation program to accelerate the delivery of what the federal government as called “ultra-low-cost solar.” The program is supported by a AUD 14 million grant from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA). The funding, which comes less than a year after 5B closed a AUD $12 million funding round, includes a heavy portion devoted to the realisation of solar installation robots.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul has announced awards for 22 large-scale solar and energy storage projects to be constructed across the state. Together, they will add more than 2 GW of clean energy and roughly 160 MW of storage to the state’s grid.
The initiative is being touted as the state’s largest land-based renewable energy procurement to date. Construction and development of the portfolio is expected to create more than 3,000 short- and long-term jobs across the state, more than $2.7 billion in private investment, and raise the state’s renewable energy total in its overall energy mix to around 66%.
The project awards were divided by region across six regions: the Capital Region, Central New York, Mohawk Valley, North Country, Southern Tier, and Western New York. While it has not yet been decided what the duration of the storage projects will be, utility-scale installation in the region often use four-hour duration, meaning we will likely see 640 MWh of storage added to the grid.
Capital Region projects
Central New York projects
Mohawk Valley projects
North Country projects
Southern Tier project
Western New York projects
In March, New York achieved the milestone of having more than 1 GW of community solar installed and operational. Much of the community solar developed in the state has received benefits from the state’s NY-Sun program, a state solar incentive program for distributed generation assets. Since being launched in 2011, NY-Sun has put forth more than $1.8 billion to advance the scale-up of solar and move the state closer to having a sustainable, self-sufficient solar industry.
In developing the 22 listed projects, developers have committed nearly $86 million in investments in disadvantaged communities throughout the state, including community-based investments such as new occupational apprenticeships, scholarship programs, and summer camps focused on supporting local disadvantaged communities. Additionally, all developers have committed to ensuring that workers associated with the construction of projects are paid a prevailing wage, a standard set by the NYS Department of Labor.
“With the largest portfolio of projects awarded to date, New York is strengthening an already massive renewable energy pipeline that is positioned to deliver increasing amounts of clean and affordable electricity to thousands of families across the state for years to come,” said President and CEO of NYSERDA and Climate Action Council Co-Chair Doreen M. Harris.

California-based Xponent Power has won the German Innovation Award for its 1.2 kW solar awning for recreational vehicle (RVs). The award was established in 1953 by the German Design Council.
The Xpanse awning is a retractable solar array that provides shade for relaxing outside of RVs. The 1.2 kW design packs a considerable amount of power into a small package attached to the exterior of the RV. Xponent Power said the awning can generate up to 6 kWh per day.
The awning can be integrated with existing rooftop solar. The company also designs 800 W and 1 kW models. Xponent Power said the awning is highly wind-tolerant, and under extreme weather conditions, the awning automatically retracts completely to protect itself. Small gaps between the modules allow wind to pass through, increasing the structure’s stability. 
The panels are bifacial, generating electricity both from sunlight above and reflective light from below. Bypass diodes are integrated with each module, meaning that if one module is shaded, it will not affect the performance of the rest. The company also includes a five-year warranty on the solar awning and one year warranty on labor.
Rather than covering the roof of the RV, which is limited in space, the awning folds out from the side of the vehicle. This prevents numerous roof penetrations and allows easy access to the roof for repairs and maintenance.
Rather than being closely ratcheted to the roof, which can cause heat management and performance problems, the array is exposed to open air for effective cooling and optimized power generation. Xponent Power tested the awning arm for 2,000 open and closed cycles with additional weight added to the array to confirm its durability.
Xponent performs the installation of the awning in-house, and the company said it has plans to have numerous installation locations across the United States. It said the design is compatible with most RV makes and models. The array can be installed on the opposite side of existing awnings, negating the need for removal.
The company said it expects to begin deliveries in 2023. The array may qualify for the 26% federal investment tax credit in 2022 and 22% in 2023.
Xponent said it is exploring modifications to adapt the Xpanse awning for residential, marine, and other applications.

Around 40,000 bees will help pollinate the fruit trees on campus and vegetation in nearby woodland areas.
The solar beehive consists of two parts: a smart internal beehive that controls the bees’ growing environment, and an external structure that provides electricity to the beehive. The structure is made of Q Cells’s Q. PEAK DUO XL-G10 panels arranged in a hexagonal shape, to resemble the format of the cells of a beehive, Albert Park, director for Hanwha’s communication committee, told pv magazine.
On average, the panels will generate more than 10 kWh of electricity per day, reaching a maximum of 15 kWh per day in summer. The electricity generated by the PV panels will be used to automatically monitor and control the temperature, humidity, water, and food inside the structure, thereby maintaining a stable growing environment for the bees. The data can be monitored and controlled in real time through the beehive’s smart system app.
“The solar beehive will effectively increase the bee population and preserve the species, as it can monitor the growth of the bees in real time and detect diseases and pests immediately,” said Professor Hye-Kyung Kim of the Department of Industrial Entomology at KNUAF.
Evidence suggests that the concentration of bees within a 1-kilometer radius of a solar farm could be up to four times higher than that of other agricultural sites. The significant increase can be attributed to the range of plant species that often grown around solar farms.
Hanwha Group said the pilot project could help to disprove the assumption that solar farms negatively affect ecosystems of bees. The company is waiting for the results of the project to determine whether to install more solar beehives, said Park.
