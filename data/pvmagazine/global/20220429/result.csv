M6 (166 mm/223 mm) wafers are now 3.06% more expensive at CNY 5.72 per unit. G1 (158.75 mm/223 mm) products can be bought for CNY 5.52 each, about 3.16% higher than the previous rate.
Zhonghuan Semiconductor has raised the price of 218.2 mm wafers by 1.1% to CNY 9.88 each. G12 (210 mm) wafers sell for CNY 9.15 each, while M10 (182 mm) wafers are now being sold for CNY 6.87 per unit, up CNY 0.08. M6 (166 mm) wafers registered the lowest increase of CNY 0.06, hitting CNY 5.7 per piece.
The China Nonferrous Metals Association (CNMA) has reported that the price of polysilicon rose to between CNY 252 and CNY 260 per kilogram this week. China’s strict pandemic measures have reportedly affected the supply chain, prompting some polysilicon makers to turn off their production lines. Some expansion plans have been postponed due to a lack of equipment, logistical barriers, and inspection delays for import polysilicon. The CNMA also pointed to insufficient polysilicon supplies. It said supplies will grow to 68,000 to 72,000 metric tons in May, which will still be short of industry needs, resulting in another round of price increases for polysilicon.
Golden Solar said in its annual earnings report this week that it generated CNY 44.8 million of its total 2021 revenue of CNY 314 million from its new cast-mono wafer business. “The group successfully transformed from a traditional manufacturer to a renewable energy technology company in 2021,” it said, noting that it plans to launch cast-mono cell production and heterojunction module output as the next stage of its transformation.
China Power said this week that it sold 1.8 TWh of solar-generated electricity in the first quarter, up 38% on the figure posted a year earlier, with an additional 22.8 GWh sold by plants associated with the power company. The respective figures for coal-fired power were 16.6 TWh plus 6.32 TWh.
Beijing Energy International has announced plans to set up a joint venture with Singapore’s Sembcorp Energy Investment to promote solar plants, energy storage facilities, and wind farms in China. Beijing Energy did not say how much would be invested in the Beijing Energy Sembcorp (Hainan) Renewables venture, but noted that it would hold a 51% stake, with Sembcorp taking the remainder.
GCL Technology has said that rising polysilicon and wafer selling prices helped turn around its business fortunes in 2021. Shareholders of the former GCL-Poly had to swallow a net loss of CNY 5.67 billion during a Covid-ravaged 2020 that also saw the manufacturer mothball wafer production. However, the average price of rod polysilicon rose from CNY 60.70/kg to CNY 147.30 in 2021. GCL Tech's investors saw a CNY 5.08 billion net profit last year, according to the company’s newly published annual report.

She told pv magazine that the most promising use cases for high-pressure PEMEL are found at 80 and 200 bar. “This fits well with the pressure requirements for several industrial hydrogen applications, such as green methanol production, transport and storage in the natural gas grid, gas storage in salt caverns, and ammonia production,” she said, noting that self-pressurized electrolyzers provide a higher overall energy consumption than electrolyzers operating at 30 bar in combination with a hydrogen compressor, due to higher compression losses, but they are compensated by lower expenses for the mechanical compressor itself.
Korea’s Lotte Chemical and Air Liquide Korea will establish a joint venture to build a hydrogen supply chain in South Korea, starting with an investment in two large-scale hydrogen centers in Daesan and Ulsan. The joint venture aims to develop the national hydrogen mobility market. “The joint venture will be established by Air Liquide Korea and Lotte Chemical with a 60:40 share each. The name of the joint venture is undecided, and the company plans to develop the business after the establishment of the corporation in July of this year,” Lotte Chemical wrote on Friday. Lotte Chemical, a daughter company of South Korean multinational conglomerate Lotte Corporation, will provide the by-product hydrogen from business sites located in Daesan and Ulsan. Air Liquide Korea, a subsidiary of the French supplier of industrial gases and services, will provide its expertise in hydrogen shipping centers and distribution.
Australia’s Aviation H2 has selected the use of liquid ammonia to turbofan combustion as the best route to carbon-free flight, the company said after a three-month feasibility study. Aviation H2, which recently launched a capital raise, will soon start modifying turbofan engines to test and prove the concept. “There are multiple reasons why liquid ammonia was selected. Chiefly its advantages include high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen density that makes it lighter and easier to transport while providing a greater energy conversion rate,” Aviation H2 Director, Helmut Mayer, said. The company expects to have Australia’s first hydrogen-fuelled aircraft in the skies by the middle of 2023. “Their research shows that converting a Falcon 50 to Liquid Ammonia Turbofan Combustion is the most efficient and commercially viable avenue to building a hydrogen-powered plane,” the company wrote on Thursday.
Australia-based technology company Hazer Group announced that the proposed Burrard Hazer Hydrogen Project in Port Moody would receive up to C$8 million of grant funding from the province of British Columbia. The project is a collaboration between Hazer Group and Canada’s energy companies FortisBC Energy, and Suncor Energy. “The Project will be a leading demonstration of the Hazer Process, an innovative methane pyrolysis technology producing low-carbon intensity hydrogen for clean energy, transport or industrial uses and a synthetic graphitic carbon by-product for manufacturing or industrial use,” Hazer Group wrote on Thursday. The initial Feasibility Study commenced in February. The companies should take a final investment decision (FID) in 2023. Operations should begin in 2025. The total budget for the pre-FID works is estimated to be C$11.25 million.
The US Department’s Loan Programs Office (LPO) offered a conditional commitment for a US$504.4 million loan guarantee to the Advanced Clean Energy Storage Project. “The facility in Delta, Utah, will combine alkaline electrolysis with salt cavern storage for grid scale energy conversion and storage using hydrogen as the energy carrier,” DOE wrote earlier this week. Using a 220 MW electrolyzer, the project could help reduce renewable energy curtailment in the Western United States. The stored hydrogen would then fuel a combined cycle gas turbine, scheduled for start-up in 2025. At first, a 30% hydrogen blend will be used. The project will use increasing amounts of hydrogen, reaching 100% in 2045. 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited Japan to meet the Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. According to Scholz, cooperation between the two countries is essential for climate issues, mainly via the creation of a hydrogen economy. Before returning to Germany, Scholz visited a hydrogen production plant in Kawasaki on Friday. This trip was his first visit to the region since he took office. Germany holds the presidency of the G7 this year; Japan will take over in January. Germany is also looking into more vital hydrogen collaboration with Canada. The Northern American country is already working with the European Union to define standards and complementary regulatory frameworks.  
Canada-based Hydrogen Optimized has signed an MOU with hydrogen-development company Green Hydrogen International (GHI) for a large electrolyzer manufacturing facility in Texas, the United States. “The factory will produce Hydrogen Optimized’s RuggedCell water electrolyzers for GHI’s planned Hydrogen City project, a previously announced 60 gigawatt (GW) green hydrogen production and salt cavern storage hub to be built in South Texas,” the two companies wrote on Wednesday. The proposed manufacturing facility will be built out in stages, with an ultimate target of 5 GW a year of electrolyzer production. GHI intends to purchase the facility’s entire output for the first 10 years of operation to supply its Hydrogen City project.
British Columbia announced two hydrogen-related investments for “zero-emission vehicle technology.” Ventilation systems expert Core Energy Recovery Solutions will receive $389,638 in funding through the Advanced Research and Commercialization program to support the production of prototype membrane humidifiers for hydrogen fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). “Humidifiers are a crucial component to the overall system and performance of FCEVs,” the Ministry of Energy wrote last week. Ion-exchange membranes expert Ionomr Innovations will receive $205,780 “to improve efficiency, lifetime and scalability in hydrogen fuel-cell power system technology.”
Hungary-based oil and gas company MOL Group and US hydrogen fuel-cell systems company Plug Power will build one of Europe’s largest-capacity green hydrogen production facilities at MOL’s Danube Refinery in Százhalombatta. The facility should be operational in 2023. “Utilizing a 10-megawatt (MW) electrolysis unit from Plug Power, MOL’s €22 million facility will be able to produce approximately 1,600 tons of clean, carbon-neutral, green hydrogen annually,” wrote MOL on Wednesday. 
Stockholm-based energy systems producer Metacon, in cooperation with engineering partner Gisab, has entered into a 56 MSEK contract to supply two electrolysis-based integrated Green Hydrogen Refuelling Stations (HRS) to hydrogen-focused Botnia Hydrogen, a company with assets mostly in Finland, but also in Sweden. “The stations, with the capacity to refuel 200 and 400 kg of hydrogen per day at 350 and 700 bar, will be located in Piteå and Arvidsjaur in northern Sweden,” the companies wrote on Wednesday. The construction is set to commence at the end of 2022; both stations are expected to be in operation in the spring of 2023.
Electric boat company Torqeedo announced a collaboration with Proton Motor Fuel Cell to integrate hydrogen fuel cell charging into its propulsion systems. The two Bavaria-based companies will collaborate on the maritime hydrogen hybrid kit to speed up recharge times. “The system will be designed for a propulsion power of 50 to 200 kW and a fuel cell power of 30 to 120 kW and will have flexible options for hydrogen storage,” Torqeedo wrote on Thursday.

The new scheme is funded via the European Union’s Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), a post-pandemic recovery plan that EU leaders agreed upon in July 2020.  The new Cypriot scheme will fund purchases and installations of solar panels at a rate of €750/kW, but capped at €1,500 per vehicle. 
The new program will also allow households that own EVs or hybrid cars to claim a maximum of €2,000 (or otherwise, €750/kW) for the installation of battery systems. System owners will also be able to claim €600 on the purchase of charging stations, as well as €450 to convert their single-phase electric systems into three-phase power supply setups.
The scheme will run until Dec. 20, 2023, although should the available funds becomes exhausted, the program will close at an earlier date. Overall, the new policy is a much-needed step in the right direction for Cyprus, which currently generates only about 16% of its electricity via renewables.
Although the country's regulatory framework allows the installation of batteries behind the meter, it has failed to install any meaningful number of storage systems to date. This is primarily due to a lack of incentives to link home batteries to other schemes, such as the country’s net metering program. 
The new policy – which combines solar, small batteries and EVs – could prove to be a game changer, given the country’s new scheme to support purchases of EVs. In late 2021, Cyprus rolled out €30 million of new subsidies for the purchase of EVs until the end of 2025, with support from the EU’s post-pandemic recovery plan.
Greek gas
Greece, on the contrary, made a disappointing announcement this week for a new €130 million subsidy for purchases of fuel for conventional cars.
Specifically, the government is supporting the purchase of fuel for 3 million cars and motorbikes, whose owners will receive about €30 to €50 each, either in cash or via a digital fuel-pass smartphone app that will provide them with free fuel at Greek gas stations. 
Greece’s new fuel subsidy concerns all private vehicles whose owners have an annual income up to €30,000 and corresponds to the months of April to June. That means the government might expand the fuel subsidy after. 
In contrast, Greece subsidizes the purchase of EVs with a €150 million budget for 2020-22, offering €50 million per year. The Greek government claims the conventional fuel subsidy will be necessary to tackle the recent spike in gas prices. 
However, one cannot help but wonder why the government did not choose to support consumers via alternative ways that would also boost the country’s energy transition. For example, it could offer a scheme like Cyprus or use the digital pass to offer free tickets for public transportation, thus boosting energy efficiency and cultivating a greener lifestyle. However, the Greek government’s subsidy for dirty fuels is a populist measure to lure voters, indicating that its green rhetoric might not be as rooted in reality as it seems.

But the exact device structures that reach commercialization, and the processes used to produce them, are still very much an open question, with universities and R&D departments throughout the world exploring a wealth of different promising approaches.
One concern on the perovskite side is developing processes that can slot into existing silicon manufacturing with minimal disruption. This was the approach taken by scientists at Switzerland’s École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), who looked for an effective way to integrate a perovskite layer on top of a commercial silicon cell textured with tiny “pyramids” that help with light trapping and cell performance but don’t lend themselves very well to having another layer deposited on top.
In 2018, the group introduced a porous organic base layer to the device, initially achieving cell efficiencies of 25.2%. And since then it has persevered with this approach, improving both the perovskite crystallization processes and the transparency of the base layer. Now, EPFL has reached a 29.2% efficiency rating for a device measuring 1 square centimeter, as confirmed by Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems.
EPFL claims this as a world-record efficiency level for a tandem cell based on fully textured silicon, and they are not too far behind the overall of 29.8% efficiency rating set by Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin in November 2021. The groups said it soon expects to be pushing for efficiencies beyond 30%.
Despite these achievements, the group said it remains cautious about getting too excited over the manufacturing prospects just yet.
“Several years of R&D are still needed to bring such technology and manufacturing processes to market,” said EPFL scientist Christophe Baliff. “A big challenge will be developing solar cells that can remain stable on our rooftops for more than 25 years. But the higher efficiency we demonstrated without changing the front texture will be very attractive for the photovoltaics industry.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/29/the-mobility-revolution-portable-ev-charging-stations-for-personal-and-shared-use/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"APRIL 29, 2022",The mobility rEVolution: Portable EV charging stations for personal and shared use,"With widespread EV adoption hampered by the inability to charge near or at home and the rollout of the charging network not happening fast enough in some areas, London-based ZipCharge has revealed the GoHub, the world’s first portable EV charging infrastructure for shared, public use. Designed to increase flexibility and convenience primarily for those without designated off-street parking, this modular, portable charging station can turn any parking space into a charging spot. The GoHub houses ZipCharge’s Go EV power banks, was first unveiled at COP26 in November last year, and comes with 5-charger one-sided and double-sided 10-unit configurations. The lightweight 4 kWh ZipCharge Go power bank is the size of a compact wheeled suitcase which can be charged in a GoHub, at home or elsewhere using a standard domestic plug. ZipCharge Go provides up to 20 miles (32km) of range in a little over 30 minutes and can then be stored in the car trunk or at home. The Go rolling power bank is now available to purchase outright for personal use or rent through the company’s energy-as-a-service model GoHub for a fee of £1, €1 or $1 for a 4kWh charge with no connection fee. The fully modular design enables GoHubs to be customized to the needs of the local community and location, whether rural or urban. The solution features more than 100 kWh of second-life batteries to store clean energy, such as wind and solar that can be installed on the top of the charging station structure, and feed it back into the grid by virtue of its bi-directional chargers. The company claims that GoHubs will be three times cheaper and three times faster to install than fixed on street level 2 chargers, transforming the payback period for AC public charging from 8-10 years to less than two. “We intend to establish the world’s first vertically integrated ‘energy point operator’ to serve hundreds of millions of people around the world so everyone can access convenient and low-cost energy,” says ZipCharge co-founder Jonathan Carrier. “We predict our portable powerbanks will outsell fixed home chargers by 2030, in the same way mobile phones overtook landlines. That’s because the Go can be used for more than charging EV charging, it’s a portable energy storage device for personal energy management. We have the bold ambition to deploy 100,000 GoHubs globally by 2030 to support EV charging, local grid resiliency and energy democracy.”
Bringing flexible and quality charging to millions of EV drivers is also the goal of ABB‘s global framework agreement with energy company Shell. Under the deal, the global technology company will supply its end-to-end portfolio of DC and AC charging stations, including Terra 360, the world’s fastest all-in-one electric car charger. The agreement builds on a partnership between the two companies that began in 2019 and will see ABB E-mobility support Shell in creating a global charging network. The energy company has set itself a goal to deploy over 500,000 charge points globally by 2025 and 2.5 million by 2030, either at residential, commercial, or its own retail sites. To date, ABB has sold more than 680,000 EV chargers across more than 85 markets; over 30,000 DC fast chargers and 650,000 AC chargers, including those sold through Chargedot.
Another big announcement came from Europe’s top carmaker Volkswagen Group and energy company bp which have joined forces to rapidly rollout EV fast charging in Europe by 2024. The first phase of the roll-out will see up to an additional 4,000 Volkswagen Flexpole chargers at bp’s Aral retail sites in Germany and bp retail sites in the UK over the next 24 months. By the end of 2024, up to 8,000 charge points could be available across Germany, the UK, and other European countries. Volkswagen’s 150 kW flexible battery-based chargers, which feature two charge points per unit, can be installed rapidly, as they do not require high voltage grid connections. The charger locations will be integrated into the navigation and other in-car apps of VW, Seat, and Skoda vehicles as well as into Volkswagen’s charging application, Elli, making it easier for drivers to find available charging points.
It is that time of the year that many quarterly reports are still coming in, and the one posted by Chinese EV and battery maker BYD makes for welcome reading. The company posted a net profit of 808 million yuan ($122.7 million) in the first quarter of 2022, up 241% from the same quarter last year. Sales increased by 63% per cent to 66.8 billion yuan, buoyed by demand for battery-powered cars. Sales of electric cars and plug-in hybrids reached a record high with 285,000 models sold in the first quarter of the year, up by 423% YoY. This includes 143,000 pure EVs (+270%) and 142,000 plug-in hybrids (+800%). The record EV sales helped offset more expensive raw material costs that the industry has been grappling with. BYD stopped production of pure combustion vehicles earlier this year.
Meanwhile, U.S. carmaker Ford has posted a $3.1 billion loss in the first quarter on the back of a sharp drop in the value of its holding in EV start-up Rivian and global chip shortage that has limited production. Ford reported $34.5 billion in first-quarter revenue, down from $36.2 billion a year earlier, with wholesale shipments of nearly 970,000 vehicles, down 9% from a year ago. Higher prices for new vehicles have helped Ford to offset some of the impact of lower sales. The net loss was primarily attributable to a market-to-market loss of $5.4 billion on the company’s investment in Rivian, which was valued at $10.6 billion at the end of 2021. Ford invested $500 million in Rivian in 2019, and the start-up’s shares rose sharply after an initial public offering last year. Its stock was trading at about $100 at the end of 2021 but has fallen to around $31 as Rivian has struggled to ramp up production of 100,000 electric delivery trucks for Amazon. Ford said its outlook for 2022 remains unchanged, and it expects a full-year profit of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion before taxes and certain other expenses. The carmaker has committed to reaching worldwide EV manufacturing capacity of at least 600,000 by the end of 2023, for which it’s ramping up battery supplies, on the way to making more than two million EVs annually by the end of 2026. As it moves towards this goal, Ford was forced to make also some unpopular moves as part of its corporate restructuring. This week, the company said it is cutting 580 engineering jobs across a mix of internal combustion and EV engineering teams, including 350 salaried employees and 230 agency workers. Today, Ford has more than 182,000 employees globally.

Switzerland-based heterojunction solar module manufacturer Meyer Burger has announced a small change in its strategy to expand production capacity. Instead of increasing the capacity of its facilities in Germany to 1 GW and in the United States to 400 MW, the planned 1.4 GW target will now be entirely accomplished at its plant in Freiberg, Germany, by the end of this year.
It will also expand its solar cell production capacity in Thalheim, Germany, from 400 MW to 1.4 GW. This will all be processed at the Freiberg plant and will not initially be used proportionately for the planned US production facility in the state of Arizona.
Meyer Burger is reacting to ongoing global logistics problems and supply chain issues, which remain tense due to the Ukraine war. It said it could minimize supply chain risks and use human resources more efficiently.
It claimed it is not shelving its plans to set up a module factory in the United States. Sales of heterojunction modules in the important US market will therefore continue. It will also pursue plans for a medium-term expansion of module production, up to 1.5 GW. The initial preparations began as planned in the first quarter.
For its plant in the United States, Meyer Burger will also have to ramp up cell production in Germany. For this purpose, additional areas have been rented out at the production site in Thalheim. The building is located in the same area as the ongoing cell production. Preparations for further expansion could begin immediately.
Meyer Burger sees strong momentum for the strategic shift made in recent announcements by the European Union. As part of Europe's strategic autonomy in the energy transition, the bloc wants to quickly rebuild and expand the solar industry along the entire value chain.

“The system can be ordered in three configurations starting from the third quarter of this year,” the company's co-founder, Michael Lau, told pv magazine.
All of the systems include a smart controller, known as the Nexol-Energy-Controller. It can work with either DC and AC power and decides autonomously if grid electricity or photovoltaics is used, with the latter being always preferred. Users can choose between one or two heating rods: the NEX-R1 and the NEX-R2.

“To install these retrofit sets, an existing tank needs 1 ½ threaded sleeves at a suitable height,” Lau explained. “We also offer a 120l tank for the two-rod configuration, which is dubbed NEX-R2x120, and the plug and play principle makes installation very easy.”
If two heating rods are integrated, they enable zone heating of the tank inlayers, said Lau. “The application of heating zones allows reducing significantly grid power consumption,” he added.
The function principle of the two-zone heating is described by the company as simple. At first, the upper zone of the storage tank near the hot water outlet is heated to 60 C. This enables faster hot water withdrawal, with PV prioritized as an operating source.
In the case of low solar radiation, the intelligent system reheats the upper zone of the water through the network. Thus, as little grid power as possible is used to provide hot water since only the upper zone needs to be heated for this purpose. As soon as the upper zone has reached its target temperature, the system switches to the lower heating element and thus heats the entire storage tank. “The energy generated by the PV panel is stored in the water,” Lau said.
The company said the standard PV installation that should be coupled to the water heater is an array with four 375 W panels. “Other configurations are possible, even with more power,” Lau added. “All you have to check is the maximum input voltage of 500 V.”
The product was developed and fabricated by Nexol in Germany. It will be available from an entry price of €799 ($845) and is purportedly suitable for the European markets, as well as other regions.
“For example, while the NEX-R2x120 is well suited to replace gas boilers in households around the Mediterranean, our R1 and R2 retrofit sets are also well suited for households in the DACH region to be integrated into existing systems and thus reduce costs,” Lau concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/29/oci-secures-1-2-million-polysilicon-order-from-hanwha-solutions/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 29, 2022",OCI secures $1.2 billion polysilicon order from Hanwha Solutions,"OCIM Sdn Bhd (OCIMSB), the Malaysian unit of South Korean polysilicon producer OCI, has signed a binding memorandum of understanding with South Korean solar manufacturer Hanwha Solutions, a unit of Hanwha, for the supply of polysilicon.
The South Korean company did not reveal the amount of raw materials that will be provided, but said the supply contract has a value of approximately $1.2 billion.
“With this MOU, OCIMSB is able to secure an additional stable buyer of Poly-Si for PV. Hanwha Solutions, targeting the low-carbon footprint solar module market, which is expected to significantly expand in the United States and Europe, can secure a stable supply of low-carbon Poly-Si,” OCI said, noting that OCIMSB produces polysilicon via hydroelectric power generation in Malaysia.
Carbon footprint rules for solar modules eligible to secure public incentives are currently in force in South Korea. These rules are similar to those applied in France, where large-scale solar tenders take low-carbon manufacturing into account, as well as the price that developers agree to accept for the power generated. South Korea, like France, has extensive nuclear power generation capacity, which will aid the low-carbon efforts of domestic solar panel manufacturers.
According to OCI, OCIMSB will reach a total polysilicon capacity of 35,000 metric tons at the end of June. The Malaysian plant resumed manufacturing in July 2020. The group raised the plant's capacity from 10,000 metric tons to 27,000 metric tons between 2018 and 2019. OCI's total annual polysilicon output – including its factory in Gunsan, South Korea – will reach 38,000 metric tons at the end of June.
Hanwha Solutions recently agreed to buy a minority stake in Norway-based polysilicon manufacturer REC Silicon ASA. The move is intended at securing low-carbon photovoltaic materials amid growing demand for renewable energy in the United States, Hanwha Solutions said in a statement. In the United States, REC Silicon owns and operates a polysilicon factory in Moses Lake, Washington, and another facility in Butte, Montana.

Indian utility NTPC Ltd. wants to deploy Switzerland-based Energy Vault’s EVx gravity-based energy storage technology and software solutions to support its clean energy initiatives.
The two parties recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to forge a long-term strategic partnership. NTPC will deploy Energy Vault’s EVx gravity-based energy storage technology and software solutions based on the outcome of a joint feasibility study.
Energy Vault’s EVx storage system is comparable to pumped hydro, using grid-scale renewable energy when supply is abundant to drive motors and raise 30-ton blocks on a six-arm crane tower, rather than water, up to a height. When power needs to be discharged back to the grid, the blocks are lowered, harvesting the kinetic energy. 
The NTPC and Energy Vault collaboration will also see the beneficial use of coal ash to manufacture composite blocks for Energy Vault’s gravity-based energy storage system.
“Energy Vault’s mission is to make sustainable, carbon-free energy a reality, and this announcement marks further advancement towards that goal with the expansion into one of the largest global markets for energy,” Robert Piconi, the chairman, co-founder and CEO of Energy Vault. “Our collaboration with NTPC builds upon previously announced commercial expansions across multiple continents as we transitioned to a public company earlier this year.”

While these energy carriers and chemical products provide significant versatility in renewable energy storage, the tipping point for their conversion efficiencies and costs have often been a matter for debate.
Now, researchers at the University of Genoa have investigated and compared four green P2X solutions – hydrogen, methane, methanol, and ammonia – powered by various renewable energy sources in terms of their technical and economic viability. The analysis has been performed considering a PEM electrolyzer for hydrogen production of a fixed size of 10 MW.
In their energy analysis, they found that power-to-hydrogen (P2H) showed the highest efficiency of 61.5%, followed by power-to-methanol (P2M) 52.7% and power-to-ammonia (P2A) 51.4%, while power-to-gas (P2G) had the lowest value of 45%. On the other hand, P2H was found to be the less convenient storage solution (volume 316 m3). The best storage solution in terms of volume and energy density was the P2M (volume 30 m3, energy density 4.3MWh/m3), while P2A is the best in terms of H2 stored in the fuel (108 kgH2/m3).
From an economic perspective, the annual cost breakdown showed that, in all the cases, the major expenditures are related to the electrical energy purchase and capex and opex of the electrolyzer (around 90% of total costs). A 50% reduction in electricity cost and electrolyzer capex could lead to a reduction of about 30% and 18% on fuel production cost (FPC), respectively, the researchers found. But selling the co-produced O2 would allow for an improvement in the economic performance, reducing the FPC.
When considering different values of levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and equivalent operating hours (EOH) characteristic of specific energy sources, the researchers compared hydrogen and ammonia production employing PV energy. They found that production costs ranged between €225 ($326)/MWh and €560/MWh for hydrogen and €250/MWh to €670/MWh for ammonia.
Finally, in terms of cost by mass, the hydrogen results in the most expensive product with €5.31/kg without the oxygen sale option, which is about 74% higher than gas production cost and even 420% higher than the methanol and ammonia costs that result in almost comparable (€1.02/kg and €1.04/kg, respectively). With that said, the resulting fuels production costs are significantly higher than market reference values (€3/kg for H2, €1/kg for CH4, €0.5/kg for MeOH, €0.6 /kg for NH3), the researchers found.
Considering the production cost in terms of energy content, the highest value is for the P2G process (€0.22/kWh) due to the lower energy efficiency compared to the other process. Accordingly, the best result is obtained for the P2H case (€0.16/kWh), and intermediate results are obtained for P2M and P2A plants (€0.19/kWh and €0.2/kWh, respectively).
The researchers described their findings in “A comparative techno-economic and sensitivity analysis of Power-to-X processes from different energy sources,” which was recently published in Energy Conversion and Management.

The FSS4 probing solution is also suitable for multi-busbar, half/triple cut and shingled structures.
“FSS4 is thinner than conventional pin-probe bars, which reduces its shadow on the cell during the measurement,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “It includes independent current and voltage probes.”
It said the current and voltage probes are insulated and separated by only 0.2 mm, which reportedly enables cell manufacturers to achieve an ideal four-wire connection to the finger electrodes.
“Each probe comprises of many reed shape strips arranged in a straight line, each of which is supported by plate spring suspensions and contacts the finger electrodes,” said the company. “About 200 contacting strips are monolithically integrated in an FSS4 for 6-inch cells, and achieve flexible contact to the finger electrodes. Therefore, good contact is achieved for all types of the finger electrodes, and also for other structures such as multi-busbar and shingled solar cells. The number of the contacting strips is dependent on the size of the cell.”
The device has a thickness of 1.2 mm and is contacting on all of the finger electrodes of busbar-less solar cells. According to Kopel, it is compatible with all kinds of conventional pin probes and can be easily installed in the existing production line by adopting a holder
and a frame with a short turn-around time and low cost. It is also adaptable to wafer sizes of M2 to M12 by increasing the number of contacting strips.
Compared to conventional contacting systems, the FSS4 purportedly offers lower and more stable contact resistance between the contacting strips and the fingers, to reduce mechanical damage to the fingers and cells during measurement.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/29/solar-panel-glut-causing-messy-false-economy-in-australia/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 29, 2022",Solar panel glut causing messy ‘false economy’ in Australia,"From pv magazine Australia
Much like Australia’s climatic patterns, its solar industry seems to have gone from drought to deluge, with the industry reporting that the panel market has been flooded with stock.
“It’s created a bit of a false economy in the market because people are buying stock at prices that they’re not really supposed to, but because of where things are at people are desperate to clear stock,” Kosta Bourandanis, sales manager at solar wholesaler Supply Partners, told pv magazine Australia. “That’s a worry because if people are selling something for cheaper than it’s actually worth, they’re making no money.”
The second half of last year saw China, the source of 80% of Australia’s solar equipment, rocked by an energy crisis at exactly the moment manufacturers were scrambling to secure critical materials and freight costs were skyrocketing. The volatility led to some manufacturers pricing their products afresh daily, causing widespread uncertainty.
“As a wholesaler, manufacturer or even retailer, trying to procure stock when you don’t really know what it’s going to cost makes it bloody hard to plan,” Bourandanis said. “Everyone loaded up last year in the fear they couldn’t access stock and now all the stocks they have ordered in the past are starting to land and its much more than the market needs.”
The unpredictability led to excess orders – or rather, orders in anticipation of what is typically the industry’s strongest period, the fourth quarter, which simply didn’t eventuate.
“[There was] a fear of having no stock so [companies] shipped lots of stock here and also they planned for a big Q4, so that’s why the oversupply happened,” One Stop Warehouse’s head of product procurement and marketing, Andy Cheng, told pv magazine.
Both Supply Partners and One Stop reported a panel glut starting around December, January when the extra orders began to roll in from China.
Typically the beginning of summer sees an influx of solar orders, but the final months of 2021 did not see interest spike as much as normal. In fact, according to analysis by Sunwiz, October was the lowest point of a year which concluded in a significantly weaker position than 2020.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/29/historic-shipment-figure-cannot-mask-huge-profits-hit-for-jinko/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CHINA",MAX HALL,"APRIL 29, 2022",Historic shipment figures cannot mask huge profit hit for Jinko,"While Chinese manufacturer JinkoSolar is understandably keen to trumpet the fact it has become the first company in the world to ship more than 100 GW of solar panels, its latest set of quarterly figures has laid bare just how much havoc China's recent anti-pandemic measures are causing for the industry.
Jinko Chairman Xiande Li pointed to a background of ongoing polysilicon and shipping cost expenses. “Epidemic prevention and containment policies in China since March have resulted in logistics congestion and sharp reductions in transport capacity, which further increased cost pressures,” he said.
The extent of those pressures was outlined in an operating-profit-margin figure which dwindled from 3% in the last three months of last year to just 0.3% in the January-March period. This means the amount of profit banked by the manufacturer for each yuan of sales fell 90% in three months.
That prompted a fall in income from operations from CNY 486 million ($74.1 million) in the fourth quarter of last year to just CNY 40.8 million in the latest three-month window. That leaves shareholders banking a quarterly profit of just CNY 28.9 million, compared to CNY 240 million in the October-December period, and CNY 221 million a year earlier.
That slump in net income was booked despite an 86% year on year rise in first-quarter revenue, to CNY 14.8 billion – albeit 9.9% down from the previous quarter – and a 57% annual rise in shipments to 8.4 GW, again slipping 13.4% from the end of last year.
“To overcome these difficulties, we took early action to ensure ample reserves of raw materials,” Li wrote. And that was reflected by the CNY 3.46 billion paid by the company to its suppliers by the end of March, up from CNY 1.84 billion at the end of 2021.
“We believe that the impact of the pandemic on production and operations is temporary,” said the Jinko chairman. He also claimed that the continuing price escalation in solar products has “convinced some customers to not wait any longer to start new projects,” even if the pandemic restrictions being applied across China at the moment have held up construction of some solar fields.
That positive outlook has persuaded the manufacturer to forge ahead with production capacity expansion plans, which will see the 16.9 GW of annual monosilicon n-type cell capacity brought online in the last quarter almost doubled to 32.9 GW by year end, as well as increases in mono wafer and module capacity, from the current 40 GW and 50 GW to 55 GW and 60 GW, respectively. That 32.9 GW of n-type cell capability will form part of 55 GW of total cell capacity this year, according to Jinko, up from 40 GW.
With the manufacturer claiming a new world record cell conversion efficiency of 25.7% for its n-type TOPCon product in the recent quarter, Jinko maintained its full-year shipment predictions at 35 GW to 40 GW, with 8.5 GW to 9.5 GW expected to be shifted in the current quarter.
In terms of the balance sheet, Jinko's investment in new production capacity has seen its long-term borrowings rise from CNY 9.9 billion, at the end of the year, to CNY 11.1 billion four weeks ago as total interest-bearing debts went up from CNY 25.6 billion to CNY 27.5 billion but its cash reserves also rose, almost doubling, from CNY 8.92 billion to CNY 16.9 billion.
