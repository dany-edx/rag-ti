Solar grazing, the practice of grazing livestock (typically sheep) on land with solar arrays, is gaining traction in the United States. A survey found that the most common initial purchases for starting this business are a pickup truck and sheep. These farmers typically oversee the grazing of an average of 55 acres of field per season, using 125 sheep for each operation. They spend an average of 14.75 hours in the field supervising on-site labor, 8.17 hours traveling, and 5.67 hours on business administration.
In addition to this valuable data, the researchers highlighted resources that could enable a grazing entrepreneur to launch a solar grazing business.

The Bock Agricultural Law and Policy Program at the University of Illinois conducted the survey during the first half of 2023, circulating it via the American Solar Grazing Association. The goal was to build on existing literature about the costs and revenues of grazing sheep at solar power facilities.
The survey’s findings, detailed in the report The Economics of Solar Grazing, were enriched with data from several reliable sources to define the costs of running a solar grazing business.
The survey found that 75% of those who signed contracts to graze their sheep on solar sites also agreed to take on vegetation management responsibilities, necessitating the purchase of lawn mowers and edge trimmers. While sheep cover large volumes of area well, they do not always meet the technical standards required by solar asset owners.

The Bock group pointed to research in New York that revealed vegetation management contracts between sheep farmers and solar power plant operators result in an annual income of USD 300 to USD 500 per acre of solar site. Prices are generally higher in New York and lower elsewhere on the east coast. The New York report also included a comprehensive income statement for grazing 56 sheep on 22 acres of land.
Another insightful document was the Mount Morris Agrivoltaic Study, which outlined in incredible economic detail the solar grazing and beekeeping business plans in conjunction with EDF Renewables’ 177 MW, 1,000-acre solar facility in Livingston County, New York.
In related coverage by pv magazine USA, from the perspective of an asset owner, BayWa r.e. has begun optimizing its sheep count while experimenting with shepherd partnership business models. The large-scale solar asset owner found that at one particularly rocky site in Texas, grazing with sheep led to increased electricity generation and savings of $413,774 compared to the cost of mowing. Although the sheep appeared to have damaged two solar modules, this was minimal compared to the 1,035 panels damaged by projectiles.
Prior research suggests that integrating agriculture into solar facilities increased respondents’ likelihood of supporting a solar facility to greater than 80%.

The Portuguese Ministry of the Environment has approved a new set of solar energy projects to connect to the grid, in collaboration with grid operators REN and E-Redes. It marks the first time since June 2019 that the Portuguese government has ensured the integration of fresh PV capacity into the power network.
In total, the ministry has granted grid-connection permits for 5 GW of upcoming projects to link to the high-voltage grid, along with 1 GW for connection to E-Grids operating at lower voltage levels.
These projects largely consist of centralized solar installations, many incorporating battery storage systems. The granted permits are contingent upon developers committing to cover the costs of reinforcing the electrical infrastructure, thereby avoiding any negative impact on the regulated charges of the national electrical system.
All selected projects are expected to become operational by 2030.
Prominent developers chosen for these projects include Iberdrola, EDPR, Hyperion, SolCarport, Neoen, Nenuphar Frontier, and Smartenergy. Among them, Fermsolar is undertaking the largest project with a capacity of 480 MW.

This projected growth, if confirmed by final figures, will indicate a substantial 33% increase from 2022.
The research firm predicts a 1% year-on-year expansion in the global solar market for 2024, followed by a 5% increase in 2025. However, a potential decline of 1% is anticipated in 2026. Notably, the Asia-Pacific region, including China, is poised to dominate PV deployment until 2032.
Wood Mackenzie said that the remarkable escalation in China's manufacturing capacity is driving new solar installations to unprecedented heights.
“Massive expansion of manufacturing capacity in China is pushing solar installations to record levels,” WoodMackenzie said. “Developers are taking advantage of plummeting polysilicon prices to rapidly expand utility-scale solar plants despite increased curtailment risks.”
The report notes China's significant influence in the PV manufacturing landscape, and suggests that the nation might transition from exporting modules to focusing on upstream cells and wafers. The research notes that policy incentives for local PV manufacturing in the United States, Europe, and India are unlikely to significantly erode China's market share in the near future.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/03/the-ev-station-forecourts-of-the-future/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,EUROPE",,"AUGUST 3, 2023",The EV station forecourts of the future,"As Europe moves towards its decarbonization targets with sales of internal combustion engine cars to be banned at various points between 2030 and 2035, and alternative fuels no longer merely optional, gas station owners are pausing to reimagine the future of the forecourt.
Alongside changing driving habits, our collective approach to driving is changing too. Service stations across the EU will likely be revamped to provide drivers with a whole new, consumer-friendly experience.
This raises several questions.
Will city centers stop selling petrol and diesel entirely? Might subscription-model pricing mean drivers stay loyal to their preferred forecourt? How will retail options change with the increased “dwell time” of EV charging?
As local governments invest in EV infrastructure and other clean fueling options, it is clear that the traditional, “stop-and-go” service stations could transform into multi-purpose destinations replete with new-look retail and leisure options.
It’s forecast that European EV infrastructure boasts the most mainstream motoring potential of all clean fueling options, with 1.39 million units sold across the continent per year. This is sure to increase dwell times across forecourts as even the most rapid public EV chargers take 10 minutes to refuel a vehicle.
Forecourt station owners can capitalise on this uptake in dwell time by enhancing their retail and entertainment offering. Convenience stores will likely be transformed into multi-purpose hubs with fresh food and a fast, easy, and digitally enabled shopping experience. This could include easy payment through apps, cashless stores, and whole-basket scanning.
Whereas convenience drove previous generations of fuel buyers, it’s likely that sustainability concerns will underpin the purchasing habits of the future. It is likely stations will have to carefully curate their product offering and building out shops and cafes could offer further opportunities to improve profit margins. Some 66% of prospective EV drivers, for instance, report they would frequent retailers more regularly if they provided usable charging facilities.
Additional services will also likely take center stage, including children’s play areas, click-and-collect departments and co-working spaces.
As stated, the forecourt is likely to include a mix of EV charging and other alternative fuels, which will require additional space.
One of the biggest threats to the fueling industry at the moment is petrol pump skimming, with consumers increasingly falling prey to opportunistic thieves who install devices at the pump which can retrieve payment card details. Enhanced security software at the pump can protect against this.
Other areas of pump modernization will likely also be technologically-led. This could include a consumer-friendly interface with EU languages; the ability to pay by card, app, or in-car; and digital pricing transparency.
Drivers may also soon be able to order refreshments and other items at the pump before collecting in-store. This is, currently, an emerging trend in the North American market and will likely soon hit Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
The year 2030 will not signify the complete demise of traditional vehicles. Petrol and diesel pumps will still be required long after the switch and will still have demand in the marketplace.
The average lifespan of an European car is 12 years, which will mean that traditional pumps are needed beyond 2040. As internal combustion engine cars become less mainstream, it is likely that these pumps will be set apart from cleaner refueling, especially with an expected emphasis on sustainability across all areas of the forecourt, not just in terms of charging and refueling but in the retail and leisure offering too.
While, for the foreseeable future, traditional petrol and diesel pumps are likely to remain fixtures of the forecourt, it is expected that the petrol station as we know it will become a completely evolved consumer experience.
Station owners can take full advantage by offering bespoke food, beverage, and entertainment options while forecourt and pump modernization, and recharging subscription services, will surely become commonplace.
The rise of the alternative fueling forecourt offers massive opportunities for fuel retailers and businesses should look to double down by offering access to the plug – and the pump.

SECI has started accepting bids to supply 1.5 GW of firm and dispatchable power from renewable power projects with energy storage systems. The projects will be developed on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis. 
SECI will sign 25-year power purchase agreements (PPAs) with the successful bidders. The projects can be located anywhere in India. The sizing of the renewables component should be suited to meet the buying entity’s 100% firm and dispatchable renewable power supply requirements in a “demand-following” manner. 
For a single project, the renewable generation components and the energy storage systems can be co-located or located at different sites. The different project components, like PV and wind, can be connected with the interstate transmission system (ISTS) network at different ISTS substations. Land and connectivity are in the scope of the developer.
“Bidders who have already commissioned RE plants/storage plants or are in the process of constructing such plants and have untied capacity may also participate,” said SECI.
A single developer can bid for a cumulative contracted capacity of 50 MW to 750 MW, in multiples of 10 MW. The maximum capacity to be allocated to a bidder is limited to 750 MW.

(Halead) has developed a PVC knife-scratch coated fabric that can be used as a reflective material for ground-mounted bifacial PV projects.
“The fabric has a reflectivity of up to 84.54%,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine, noting this percentage surpasses by far the 70-75% reflectivity offered by snow, which is the best form of albedo surface. “Reasonable paving of reflective materials on the ground can enhance the light efficiency of the backplane of the module, thereby improving the overall power generation efficiency of the modules.”
Called Sunplus, the reflective fabric has a thickness of 0.4 cm and consists of an anti-ultraviolet (UV) protective coating, a reflection factor coating, a precision coating, a functional framework, and a textile protective layer.
The manufacturer claims that the product can be deployed in different environments, due to its physical strength, bending resistance, and temperature resistance. It mentions deserts, wastelands, rooftops, hay landforms, rolling hills, agricultural land, and even water.
The spokesperson said the solution can ensure a 9.03% gain in annual power generation and an 8.88% increase in power output per W compared to bifacial projects without the fabric, adding that these results were confirmed by Germany's TÜV SÜD.
The certification body also certified that the material can retain 68.55% of its reflectivity after 10,000 h, with the material surface showing no cracks or delamination. “The product has passed many environmental protection regulations such as Europe SVHC / RoHS 2.0 / California 65,” the spokesperson added.
The company already sold its solution for several large scale PV projects in Oman, India, Japan, and China.

The group of researchers, led by the University of Leeds, claims that utilizing heat pumps to preheat hydrogen to very high temperatures could reduce European industry demands by approximately 200 TWh per year, with a reduction of 40 TWh per year in the UK alone.
In the study “Reducing industrial hydrogen demand through preheating with very high-temperature heat pumps,” published in Applied Energy, the scientists said their findings stem from recent developments in the field of thermo-mechanical energy storage, which enable heat pumps to operate at very high temperatures.
“Heat pumps have typically been considered for low-temperature applications in buildings, district heating, and industry, with maximum temperatures of up to around 75–100 C,” the study notes,  adding that combining heat pumps with thermal energy storage has enabled scientists to reach an operating temperature of 500 C with argon as the working fluid.
The researchers said that, while heat pumps are for now far from reaching the extreme temperature required for many industrial heat processes, such as blast furnaces, they can be harvested to preheat combustion air or hydrogen. The article assessed the performance of preheating to temperatures of 300–500 C, and found better cost savings in the higher point.
“For a given combination of electrolyzer capex and electricity price, the relationship between relative cost saving and temperature is found to be linear over the 300 C to 500 C temperature range,” they said. “Adding a reverse Joule-Brayton heat pump to a green hydrogen-based heating system provides cost savings when electricity prices exceed around GBP5 ($6.35)/ MWh. At electricity prices above GBP30/MWh and electrolyzer costs above GBP400/kW, cost savings exceed 5% when preheating to 300 C and 8% when preheating to 500 C.”
Heat pumps based on the reverse Joule–Brayton cycle are commonly utilized for small-scale applications. They usually draw ambient air into a compressor and then convey the hot compressed air into a heat exchanger where it is cooled, thereby delivering heat to a radiator circulating water or a hot water system. Finally, it expands the air through a reciprocating expander to atmospheric pressure and pushes it out to the atmosphere.
The scientists explained that the cost-saving ensured by this heat pump system is possible partly by the fact that heat pumps absorb heat from the environment and therefore reduce electricity demands. In the proposed system configuration, the group assumed that the heat pump transfers heat from a water source such as mine water to an industrial plant. More cost saving is related to the use of less fuel, hydrogen in this case, that is made possible by its preheating.
“Heat pumps appear to be a lower cost preheating option than electric boilers at electricity prices above around GBP25/MWh, with levelized cost savings on the electric boiler option reaching approximately 4% at electricity prices above GBP130/MWh,” the academics explained. “However whether the savings from using heat pumps outweigh their added complexity requires further investigation and should be considered on an application-specific basis.”
They said their work might help decarbonize the world's economy, as process heat that can utilize heat pumps accounts for around 11% of global energy demand.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/03/financing-implementation-of-solar-energy-solutions-in-the-pacific-island-countries/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,ASIA,OCEANIA",,"AUGUST 3, 2023",Financing implementation of solar energy solutions in the Pacific Island countries,"Over 80% of the population living in Pacific Island Countries (PIC) have access to electricity, with electricity access being around 80% in rural areas, according to the World Bank. A large part of this access, around 80%, is provided by diesel generators using imported fuel, which costs around USD 6 billion annually. This situation is due to the dispersed geographical nature of the island states and the prohibitively high cost of providing grid connectivity to far-flung islands. The result is that residents of these countries face high electricity costs, which can be up to three times the average bill of consumers in the US.
Building self-reliance in the energy sector through increased capacity of renewable energy-generated electricity is the way out of this issue for these countries. It will not only transition them to clean energy, but also greatly strengthen economic resilience. Many of these countries have hydropower potential, which they are already using to a good extent. But an area with reasonably high potential and low utilization is solar energy. Developing solar energy generation capacity in the PICs faces a range of issues, such as lack of technical capabilities and skilled workforce, challenging geographical conditions, weak regulatory and policy frameworks, and underdeveloped capital markets, all of which contributes a lack of access to the required finance.
While globally the solar sector has started seeing significantly improved mobilization of investment, along with increased uptake of solar, and there are now a range of innovative models for financing, many of these are not applicable in their present form to the PICs. In the case of the PIC economies, they have relatively lower energy demand and growth projections compared to countries where the bulk of energy investments are directed. As a result, there is a limited number of private sector actors and private sector financing.
Furthermore, with the dispersed population and diesel generator-based connectivity, there is a greater need for stand-alone, smaller-scale projects. These face several challenges in terms of required skills, capacities, business models, regulations than the more mature and developed markets. Considering these aspects, and that financing for a technology is largely dependent on maturity levels, as well as the local sectoral and country context, there are several barriers to finance for solar in PICs. However, given the reality of the PICs being amongst the most highly vulnerable countries to climate change, they are getting more attention and preference for grants, and other supportive finance mechanisms. This provides the opportunity to design appropriate, long-term impact projects for such investments, which can change the economic trajectory of these countries.
In general, the types of finance required to scale technologies can be broadly categorized:
It is notable that solar project investments in most developed and emerging markets are of the third category, investment finance, driven almost entirely by the private sector based on commercial aspects, while in other markets, such as Africa, risk mitigation finance is required. It provides an extra layer of comfort for market development and draws in private sector investors.
In the case of PICs, it may be even more complex due to the need for stand-alone solar energy systems and mini-grids, which to be viable for larger investments would require aggregation at a sectoral or programmatic level to become feasible. Revision of existing regulations would also be required. Thus, the investment required in this case may be in the nature of ‘readiness finance’ accompanied by ‘hand-holding’ in the initial stages for a larger number of applications that have been categorized as investment finance in other markets. Also, payment guarantees and additional assurance through infrastructure insurance, or guarantee against currency fluctuations, may be needed to mobilize private sector investments.
This approach is what the developmental organizations have been taking for deploying many adaptation-related projects and evolving new viable models, but in the case of solar they have transitioned away from it in the belief that the sector has evolved into commercially viable projects. However, in the Least Developed Countries, including the PICs, innovative financing is still needed. It is important to note that a large part of this readiness finance support would be to build local technical skills and institutional capabilities, which are often the critical missing elements in developing markets to enable such projects. Support is required to devise viable business models for investments, which might aggregate several small projects, or service-based operating models, such as pay-per-use. Financing would also be required to re-design existing product systems to create appropriate and innovative solutions given the lack of available land and the extreme weather events these countries frequently face. Thus, solutions such as floating solar and agro-photovoltaics, may need to be explored.
The International Solar Alliance (ISA) has been working across the PICs, deploying specific solar applications, such as rooftop solar, lights, and solar boats, building capacities through targeted training and conducting feasibility studies for innovative infrastructure solutions. To accelerate the deployment of solar in PICs, financing solutions formed through collaborative efforts, which are able to address these wide-ranging aspects by providing a level of grant support and attracting private international and local investments through instruments, such as payment guarantees, is the need of the hour.

Spanish energy company Cox Energy has finalized the acquisition of Spain-based renewable energy developer Abengoa.
Cox Energy's business plan has garnered support from worker and union organizations, public administrations, the bankruptcy administrator, and a consortium of lenders including Santander, Caixabank, Crédit Agricole, BBVA, Bankinter, and HSBC. This consortium provided €150 million ($163.2 million) of guarantees.
In April, Cox Energy successfully acquired Abengoa's assets. However, Spanish investment firm Urbas, another bidder for the assets, lodged two appeals alleging that Cox Energy had disclosed “business secrets” of Abengoa during the insolvency proceedings.
The confirmation of the award to Cox Energy for Abengoa's assets took place in June, following intervention by Spain's General Treasury of Social Security (Tesorería General de la Seguridad Social – TGSS) to ensure the proper handling of Abengoa's debt status.
Abengoa initiated insolvency proceedings for its main unit in May 2022. Its request for a temporary €249 million state aid package was declined by the Spanish government.
Cox Energy has been listed on BME Growth, a sub-market of Bolsas y Mercados Españoles, since July 3. The company has more than 4.7 GW of installed PV capacity across 60 projects.

The Fulda University of Applied Sciences in Germany has developed a turnkey self-sufficient solution that supplies buildings with heat and electricity using hydrogen-based technology.
Munich-based Ostermeier H2ydrogen Solutions (OHS) built the system in accordance with the researchers' specifications, fitting the entire technology within a shipping container. It includes essential components such as a photovoltaic inverters, batteries, heat pumps, heat and cold buffer storage, electrolyzers, hydrogen storage units, compressors, and fuel cells.
The solution uses a specially developed energy management system to adapt production to different scenarios, optimize renewable energy use, and support the grid.
“The aim of our research is to further develop the algorithms of our energy management system and to implement energy-optimized operation all year round,” said Ulf Schwalbe, a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at Fulda University of Applied Sciences and the head of the Electromobility and Renewable Energy research group.
OHS wants to give the “EcoreOne” container an externally attractive design for use in the living environment. It has already developed a modular system of decentralized storage solutions for larger industrial and residential building complexes, with a focus on the long-term storage of renewable electricity.
“The container for the Fulda University of Applied Sciences is a world first for us. I'm very excited about the practical insights that the research team will gain with it,” said OHS Managing Director Markus Ostermeier.
Since March, the container has undergone test operations at the OHS company premises in Schweiternkirchen, Bavaria. Recently, it was transported to Fulda and established there.
The forthcoming research work in Fulda aims to achieve several objectives. One goal is to extend the operational lifespan of heat pumps. The researchers also plan to enhance energy management solutions for efficient supply to both residential and industrial buildings. In addition, they will assess the system's integration with the energy market and its capability for temporary storage of heat, cold, and power across diverse climatic and weather conditions.
The project has secured financial support from the European Regional Development Fund (Next Generation EU) and the Ministry for Science and Art of the German state of Hessia.

Australian startup MGA Thermal said it has secured new funds to provide a foundation for the next phase of its growth. The funds will facilitate the commissioning of an automated production line at its factory in Tomago, New South Wales, accelerating operations well into 2024.
MGA CEO Erich Kisi said with the new production line – which will be capable of manufacturing more than 1 MWh of MGA Blocks every day – fast approaching completion, the latest round of investment will enable the company to strategically expand its commercial division and invest in engineering and implementation.
“With the imminent completion of our production line, we’re on track to produce 1,000 blocks per day which can then be assembled into 24/7 renewable energy storage,” he said.
The company is commercializing a ‘miscibility gap alloy’ approach to thermal energy storage, storing heat in blocks made largely from aluminium and graphite and dispatching it to generate electricity.
MGA’s patented thermal energy storage blocks, about the size of a large house brick, consist of small alloy particles embedded within graphite-based blocks enclosed in a fully insulated system. Once heated the alloy particles can store heat for days with minimal energy loss. Heat exchangers are used to absorb heat from the blocks, with the heated gas or fluid suitable for industrial heat applications or to drive a steam turbine to generate electricity.
The company is in the final stages of commissioning a demonstration unit at its Tomago base that it said will provide a tangible example of the thermal energy storage system in action and substantiate its scalability for potential customers and partners.
MGA said the demonstration unit will include modular blocks stacked into large assemblies within MGA-designed thermal energy storage (TES) systems.
“These TES systems are able to store millions of kilowatt hours of energy in a cheaper and longer-lasting way compared to other dispatchable solutions,” the company said. “A stack of 3,700 blocks in our demonstration unit, about the size of a shipping container, stores enough energy to power more than 135 homes for 24 hours.”
Mark Croudace, MGA deputy CEO and chief commercial officer, said there is no shortage of demand for the company’s technology.
“Renewable energy sources come with their limitations, especially when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow,” he said. “Plugging this gap is the reason we exist. MGA Technology is perfectly aligned to generate 24/7 clean steam for harder-to-abate industrial sectors, a rapidly growing very large market domestically and globally.”
The latest funding round attracted support from existing investors including Main Sequence, Varley Holdings, Melt Ventures and New Zealand’s Climate Venture Capital Fund while Understorey Ventures and Australian advisory firm Pollination Group have signed on as new investors.
Pollination CEO Martijn Wilder said MGA’s technology has enormous potential to support the uptake of clean energy in Australia.
“The energy transition for the country’s heavy industry to clean energy is a huge challenge and one that requires us to rethink the way we store energy,” he said. “MGA Thermal provides on-demand zero carbon heat which can decarbonise many industrial uses as well as provide clean electricity generation.”

Slated to be fully grid-interconnected in the fourth quarter of 2023, the gravity tower will mark the world’s first non-pumped hydro gravity-based storage facility. The project is located near a wind power facility outside of Shanghai in Jiangsu province, China. It is a 25 MW/100 MWh storage system that makes use of the company’s new ribbon-based lifting systems.
“While this represents a significant milestone, our work in China is just beginning given recent local announcements of multi-GW hours of gravity energy storage buildouts, including projects announced in 2022 supporting China’s ‘Zero-carbon parks’ initiative with Energy Vault’s gravity energy storage technology,” said Robert Piconi, chair and chief executive officer of Energy Vault, in reference to a plan to build five storage projects with a combined storage capacity of 2 GWh in China.
EVx, the Energy Vault system, has demonstrated round-trip efficiency of about 75% in a demonstration project installed in 2020 in Switzerland. The company said it expects that to be improved to about 80%, placing it in a similar range as pumped hydro storage and even grid-scale batteries.
Energy Vault’s storage device lifts composite blocks using an electric (solar-powered) motor. The lifted blocks are stacked, which creates potential energy. As the blocks are lowered, the energy is harvested and dispatched for use. It said the tower’s design is based on the physics of pumped hydroelectric energy storage. However, as a solid “mobile mass,” the composite blocks do not lose storage capacity over time. The composite blocks can be made cheaply, said the company, using excavated soil from the construction site, waste materials like mine tailings and coal ash, and even fiberglass from decommissioned wind turbines.
The tower is controlled by computer systems and machine vision software that orchestrate the charging and discharging cycles. A range of storage durations from two to 12 hours or longer is achievable, said the company. This first commercial installation in China will use a 4-hour duration.
In the latest, “In Conversation” issue of pv magazine we talk to a range of people about their experience with solar, from a sailor and a pair of overland adventurers to a mountain climber and more besides. We also focus on Africa to consider why a continent with such vast solar resource still lags more developed economies when it comes to widespread PV and energy storage rollout.
The first commercial installation is being built in partnership with Atlas Renewable and China Tianying. A subsidiary company of China Tianying recently announced it formed an agreement with the People’s Government of Huailai County to build an additional 100 MWh gravity energy storage project. Energy Vault said it will provide more details on this expansion during the company’s second quarter 2023 earnings conference call scheduled for Aug. 8, 2023.
“This milestone could not have been achieved without the unprecedented collaboration between the collective teams in the US and China, as the world’s two largest economies have joined forces to meaningfully address climate change. Energy Vault’s breakthrough, innovative technology is on the cusp of playing a critical role in supporting China’s clean energy transition and 30-60 decarbonization policy,” said Eric Fang, chief executive officer, Atlas Renewable.^
