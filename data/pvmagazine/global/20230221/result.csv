Transgrid, the grid operator for the Australian state of New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory (ACT), has partnered with German manufacturer Zeck to use its ZECK AI/Steel Separator (ZAS), an innovative machine that enables the recycling of old transmission lines – providing significant cost and emissions reductions.
The network operator said that prior to the adoption of the ZAS technology, used conductors needed to be shipped overseas for the removal of the outer aluminum layer for recycling. The ZAS machine can do this on site – an innovation which Transgrid claims cuts 90% of the emissions involved in recycling conductors.
Transgrid also forecasts an improved return on its scrap metal recycling of up to AUD 3 million ($2.06 million) over the next three to five years.
By feeding conductors into the ZAS machine under tension, the previously outsourced task of removing the outer aluminum layer is now performed onsite and efficiently, with said aluminum cut into 30 mm to 70 mm pieces for easy smelting. At the other end of the ZAS machine, the undamaged conductor's steel core is wound onto a cable drum, also ready for recycling.
It was one of Transgrid's field coordinators, Mitch Coppock, who first pitched the idea of using the ZAS machine.
“Something like that hasn't been done in Australia before,” said Coppock. “Anything innovative we can do is very important in our industry especially anything that can have good long-term effects on the environment.”
It's an “everyone wins” situation, says Coppock, as Transgrid can get a return on its scrap metal three times higher than before, while “the environment wins with reduced emissions and local businesses benefit too as they get readily available and processed aluminum.”
The trial has already seen 40 km of conductors processed through the ZAS machine in Sydney, with each meter of conductor yielding approximately a kilogram of aluminum.
It has been a period of firsts for the network operator, which recently began trialing its first electric pickup truck among a 400-strong diesel vehicle fleet.

“In recent years, with the proliferation of renewable power and massive hydropower capacity, Portugal has been producing more power than its actual consumption,” GlobalData said in a statement. “However, having only grid connection with Spain, the excess generated power without a robust connected energy grid or ample storage could go to waste.”
Solar has been the fastest-growing renewable energy source in Portugal since 2013, with cumulative installed capacity hitting 2.59 GW at the end of 2022. The country aims to add 2.57 GW of new solar capacity by the end of 2023, according to the national energy-saving plan.
Portugal’s renewables share increased from 7.9% of the electricity mix in 2000 to 30.2% in 2010 and 43.3% in 2021. Under its National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) 2021-30, the Portuguese government set a target to generate 47% of its gross final energy consumption from renewable sources by 2030.
However, the country will only achieve these targets with heavy investments in storage solutions and upgrades to the national grid, according to GlobalData.
“With energy storage solutions and a robust grid system, the country can reduce electricity imports, improve efficiency, increase renewable generation, and meet its climate goals,” said Attaurrahman Ojindaram Saibasan, power analyst at GlobalData.

There was a slight distortion in the module market in early 2023 because of a recent patent infringement lawsuit in the Regional Court of Düsseldorf, brought by Hanwha Q Cells against Trina Solar. Hanwha and Trina announced, on Friday, Feb. 17, 2023, they had reached a settlement in the dispute enabling “both parties to use each other’s solar patents and respectively drop all pending cases between the two companies,” as reported by pv magazine.
With this settlement, the disruption has been resolved and Trina continues to pull out all the stops to ramp up its production of TOPCon [tunnel-oxide passivated contact] products.
Stefan Kutscher, managing director of the wholesaler and installation company SK Solar, believes that recent amendments to Germany’s Renewable Energy Act do not go far enough to resolve challenges present in the German PV market. He still views the time-consuming procedure for getting required plant permits as a major obstacle, although the time pressure has been eased somewhat. Instead of radically simplifying overly complex regulations, the authorities have in some cases introduced new ambiguity and formulations that leave a great deal of room for interpretation. The best example of this is the sales tax adjustment for small private systems. For months, the industry has been puzzling over how the new regulation in the annual tax law is meant to be implemented. At least there has now been an initial attempt at clarification from Germany’s finance ministry.
Efforts to find real solutions to problems of grid access, connection conditions, and certification of medium-to-large systems have been in vain so far, says Michael Reck, project developer at GME clean power AG. Developers still face major hurdles that can hinder the rapid implementation of planned projects and call into question their economic viability. Nevertheless, he thinks that improved availability of the required components, and falling module prices, will leave enough profitable projects in the pipeline for the next few years. Expected average construction costs would, he believes, ensure remuneration rates between €0.08 ($0.09**)/kWh and €0.10/kWh in most cases – sufficient to give investors an adequate return over the calculated 20- to 25-year plant service life. A moderate cap on remuneration, even for unsubsidized plants, or the threat of the government skimming additional revenues, should therefore do little to diminish the attractiveness of larger solar projects.
 
Reck’s colleague Gerald Wotruba, Chief Sales Officer at GME clean power, speculates that the elimination of a verification requirement at the module level will increase the potential for re-powering existing projects with below-average energy yields. As a result, sites that are already developed could be better utilized and the output of existing plants could be increased within certain limits. He sees an ongoing string-inverter shortage, which will probably only slowly resolve itself in the second half of the year. In addition, there is a shortage of skilled workers, particularly evident among nationally active engineering, procurement, and construction services companies.
Installation crews traveling all over Germany, or even Europe, are now hard to find. What little installation-team capacity is available has to be locked in early and for an extended period.
Florian Meyer-Delpho, CEO of Installion GmbH, agrees that there is an urgent need to remedy the labor situation. Meyer-Delpho is part of a delegation of energy industry representatives that recently informed German Chancellor Olaf Scholz of the acute need for skilled workers as part of the national, pan-industrial Alliance for Transformation consultative group established by the government. The group, in cooperation with ministries and business associations, aims to develop solutions to the acute shortage of skilled workers, among other issues.
The problem has at least been recognized. The next step is to provide sufficient budget and suitable infrastructure and find training providers. What worked well in Germany recently, in the acute emergency situation with vaccination centers or refugee reception centers, could certainly also be organized to tackle the shortage of installers if the political will is there.
Overall, the market outlook is positive. Demand for small systems in particular will continue for quite some time and will offer work for installers. The days of panic buying and consumers blindly accepting quotations, as we saw last year, are probably over.
As far as installers are concerned, more competition will revive business and make it more transparent, and system prices will stabilize. But industry representatives also see growth in medium-to-large PV projects, especially in non-subsidized systems. With forward-looking component purchasing, sound costing, and quality-conscious implementation, investors can look forward to rising returns and commercial businesses to a lasting reduction in energy costs.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/21/developers-accelerating-construction-of-large-scale-solar-across-africa/,"MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,NORTHERN AFRICA,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA",,"FEBRUARY 21, 2023",Developers accelerating construction of large-scale solar across Africa,"Solar in Africa has historically been driven by a limited number of “hot spots” such as South Africa, Morocco, and more recently, Egypt. While these countries continue to lead the charge with important solar initiatives, it is interesting to note that more and more other countries are also adopting solar.
This means that more people across the continent now have access to clean and reliable power, but also that the industry as a whole has a wider territory to expand its presence in, develop projects and partnerships, and grow its business footprint. This is a very positive trend for the industry, which will inevitably lead to economies of scale through network effects, while allowing local companies and technicians to further specialize in solar, expand their businesses, and hire more people.
In 2022, if we consider installations for large-scale projects, commercial-industrial arrays, minigrids, and solar home systems (hence not accounting for residential installations):
The country that led the charge in 2022 may be somewhat unexpected, but at the same time it is a perfect illustration of solar now reaching a new range of countries across Africa. With 284 MW, Angola was indeed the country where the most PV was installed in 2022. The top five also includes South Africa (111.8 MW), Egypt (80 MW), Ghana (71.3 MW), and Mozambique (41.9 MW).
The growing footprint of solar becomes even more impressive if we look at projects under development. If we consider projects that have been announced over the past 12 months, then 49 African countries are considered to be working on at least 1 MW of solar and 29 on more than 100 MW.
Since the AFSIA Annual Outlook report 2023 was released, three new large-scale projects have already been commissioned or are about to be commissioned. They include the 37.5 MW Boundiali solar plant in Ivory Coast, the 1.8 MW plant in Antahala, Madagascar developed by GreenYellow and Axian Group, and the 7.2 MW Lucapa plant in Angola, which is part of the wider 370 MW portfolio developed in the country by MCA Group.
We should also put the spotlight on Sierra Leone which has inaugurated its first large-scale project at the end of 2022 with the 5 MWp Baoma 1 solar PV plant, as well as the 5 MW solar farm on Romainville island in the Seychelles financed by Abu Dhabi Fund for Development. All these projects are home to countries which have rarely been on the solar radar previously. Moreover, in many cases they are the first of a series of additional projects which are at different stages of development.
Three other very interesting large-scale projects are at construction stage at the time of writing this article. The largest is the  50 MW Marondera solar station in Zimbabwe which will start construction in March. Gambia will soon also be home to the 23 MW Jambur project, as the Gambia National Water and Electric Company has started construction after finding a financing agreement the World Bank and the European Investment Bank. Finally, Axian group (again!) is currently expanding the Ambatolampy solar power station with an additional 20 MW of PV and 5 MWh of storage. These three projects alone represent 10% of the total commissioned capacity of large-scale projects in 2022.
If we go even more upstream in the development cycle, other projects in “solar rookie” countries should also attract the industry’s attention as noteworthy projects have recently passed crucial financing stages. MIGA has provided a $5.6 million guarantee to cover the risks connected to the 2.8 MW Baidoa hybrid solar power in Somalia. In Liberia, the World Bank has pledged $96 million to build a 60 MW solar power plant, while AfDB has approved a $2 million and €10 million ($10.7 million) loan package to co-finance the construction of the 100 MW solar power plant in Kairouan, Tunisia. Further east, Egypt is moving closer to realize its largest wind and solar projects thanks to a $1.1 billion support package from IFC to Abydos Solar Company and Amunet Wind Power Company to develop 560 MW PV and 505 MW wind plants.
In a followup article, we'll highlight the interesting developments taking place in Cape Verde, Botswana, Eritrea and many other countries that are making their first steps to host large-scale solar projects. But one thing is for sure: Most African governments have now understood the benefits of solar to quickly add capacity to their grids and supply much-needed power to their citizens in a cheap and environmentally friendly way.

India’s Ministry of Power has prepared draft guidelines to promote the development of pumped storage projects (PSP) across the country.
India plans to reduce the emission intensity of its gross domestic product by 45% by 2030, to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070.
Given the rising integration of wind and solar power into the grid, PSPs are of paramount importance in providing greater inertia and balancing power to the grid. They can store a large amount of energy and provide frequent starts/stops and faster ramp-ups/ramp-downs.
The Central Electricity Authority's draft National Electricity Plan (NEP)  indicates that 18.8 GW of PSPs and 51.5 GW of battery energy storage systems (BESS) are needed to integrate planned renewables capacity addition up to 2032. The PSP capacity requirement could further increase if the cost of BESS does not come down as expected.
The PSP guidelines cover the allotment of project sites, charges to be paid by developers, the monetization of ancillary services, the use of exhausted mines to develop PSPs, environmental clearances for off-river PSPs, and green finance.

Research firm Sunwiz has published a list of Australia’s top solar panel and inverter manufacturers, as well as details of buying trends throughout 2022.
Sunwiz said that by the end of 2022, leading Chinese manufacturers had managed to regain some of their market share from “premium” brands, after falling sharply from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022. Chinese brands have not quite made it back to the 80% market share they enjoyed in the first half of 2021, but the rounded out the year above 70%.

“Premium” brands and other manufacturers grew considerably between the third quarter and the fourth quarter of 2021, before gradually sliding back over the course of 2022. It is worth nothing that other manufacturers, primarily smaller Chinese brands, finished off 2022 in a markedly better position than they were for most of 2021.
In alphabetical order, Australia’s top 10 solar panel manufacturers in 2022 were:
Leading Chinese inverter manufacturers reached a high point in their combined market share in the middle of 2022, before easing back slightly toward the end of the year, said Sunwiz.

Inversely, European inverter brands hit a low point mid-year, but clawed some of that marketshare back by the year’s end.
Module-level power electronics (MLPE) stayed pretty much flat throughout the course of the year, with a minuscule rise over the first quarter, followed by a corresponding drop in the fourth quarter. Likewise, the market share of other inverter brands stayed pretty much flat throughout 2022.

It said that the prices for the raw material ranged from CNY 230/kg to CNY 250 last week, and noted that prices for monocrystalline silicon ranged from CNY 222/kg and CNY 248/kg, up 31.37% from the middle of January. The organization said that the average price of monocrystalline silicon has now hit CNY 235/kg.
“After China’s recent new year holiday, wafer manufacturers returned to high operation rates in order to handle downstream orders. As a result, they quickly consumed all polysilicon in stock,” the CNMIA said. “This contributed to a tense supply situation and higher prices.”
The association said that the recent drop in polysilicon prices is a temporary phenomenon.
“Wafer manufacturers improved their operating rates in response to the false signals, resulting in a remarkable increase in polysilicon demand,” said CNMIA. “Polysilicon buyers will make procurement decisions as quickly as possible and determine the price as early as possible in the price upturn, as inventories are running low and the pressure will rise on manufacturers to replenish their stocks. This will likely bring the price rebound continues.”
CNMIA said it expects a long-term price rebound in the first half of the year, before another series of new polysilicon plants go online.
Longi, meanwhile, has raised the prices of its wafer products. The solar manufacturer now prices M10 p-type, 150-micrometer wafers at CNY 6.25 each, up 15.74%. It is selling its M6 wafers for CNY 5.40 each, up 18.94%.
“The price increase is mainly due to the recent big increase in the price of upstream polysilicon,” Longi said in a statement. “The company's silicon wafer prices have to be adjusted in line with the market.”
This is the first time this year that Longi has raised prices. Its last silicon wafer price update was on Dec. 23, 2022.

The system will cover most of the heating and cooling needs of its building complex in the town of Martinscica.
The EU-funded Seawater Heat Pump Project aims to replace an existing water-to-water heat pump and electric boilers with a new heat pump, which will use seawater as its heating source. The existing system has a required output of 280 kW, with 100 kW provided by the water heat pump.
“The existing heat pump draws thermal energy from the process water which is further used in the flow system to maintain a minimum temperature of 3 C, however, due to the high costs of the concession fee for the process water, the operation of the heat pump is neither financially profitable nor adequately energy efficient, which represents the problem that the project aims to solve,” VLS explained on the project’s website.
VLS said the new heat pump’s main advantage is the relatively constant temperature of the seawater throughout the year.
“Due to the more favorable temperature parameters of seawater compared to process water, the heating factor of the seawater heat pump is large,” says VLS.
VLS recently launched a tender to find companies to offer preparatory services to support the design and technical documentation needed to build the seawater heat pump. The deadline for submissions is Feb. 24, 2023. The contract has an estimated value of €30 million ($32 million).
The installation of the seawater heat pump is expected to reduce electricity consumption by 155,872 kWh/year and CO2 emissions by 36,600 kg/year. The project has a total projected value of €480 million and is backed by €233 million of grants from the Croatian Ministry of Regional Development and the European Union. Development started in June 2022 and completion of the project is expected by March 31, 2024.

They said their approach can be combined with solar generation in a photovoltaic-electrolyzer (PV-EC) configuration.
“The novelty of our approach consists of utilizing standard-sized large area shingled silicon PV to provide over 1.23V for water splitting combined with low-cost anion-exchange water electrolysis, which combines the higher operating current densities of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) with low-cost materials from the alkaline electrolysis,” researcher Nina Plankensteiner told pv magazine.
The scientists presented their findings in “Photovoltaic–Electrolyzer System Operated at >50 mA cm−2 by Combining Large-Area Shingled Silicon Photovoltaic Module with High Surface Area Nickel Electrodes for Low-Cost Green H2 Generation,” which was recently published in RRL Solar. They explained that PV-ECs offer the highest technological readiness level and the highest solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies among all electrolyzer technologies.
“In PV-EC systems the photovoltaic technology of choice, that commercially delivers low-cost electricity with stable efficiencies of 20-25% at 30-40mA/cm2, are in-series connected silicon solar cells, providing >1.23V for water splitting,” said researcher Joachim John. “In the next decade, silicon-tandem configurations with perovskite top-cells might play an additional role with conversion efficiencies approaching 30%.”
They described the proposed system as having a “commercially relevant configuration.” They said that the AEM electrolyzer features nanomesh electrodes with a huge surface area of 26 m2/cm3 made of earth-abundant nickel, as the researchers previously reported.
“In-series shingling of silicon solar cells is an especially attractive approach for solar water splitting applications, since a sufficient high voltage per standard cell area can be achieved,” they said, in reference to the shingled panels.
The modules are busbar-free structures, with only a small proportion of cells not exposed to sunlight. The cells are bonded to form a shingled high-density string and the resulting strips are connected through a conductive adhesive. The reduced number of busbars reduces shadowing losses.
The lab-scale, single-cell electrolyzer developed by the academics features two 4-micrometer thin high-surface area nickel nanomesh electrodes. It also features six silicon heterojunction cells with shingles of 38.5 cm2 cut from 15.6 cm2 x 15.6 cm2 standard cells.
“The cells were connected in-series and span a variable open-circuit voltage range from 0.7V to 4.3V, depending on the number of cells connected,” the scientists explained, noting that the cells achieved an average efficiency of around 20% and a fill factor of approximately 80%. “The current-voltage characteristics from the electrolyzer showed that 1.8 V to 2.2 V are required to match an electrolyzer current density between 20 and 100mA/cm2. This minimum voltage requirement can be achieved by connecting three or four silicon cells in-series.”
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the PV-EC system was reportedly able to produce hydrogen for around 20 hours and achieved a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 10% at electrolyzer current densities of approximately 60 mA cm−2, which the team described as the highest current density reported for PV-EC systems in the literature.
The solar-to-hydrogen efficiency was determined by in-situ monitoring of the most important system parameters, such as operating current, voltage, and hydrogen gas flow. The researchers said that the accurate determination of this figure of merit is important when comparing PV-EC systems with each other. They noted that longer stability measurements should be tested at sufficiently high current densities to stress the system.
The researchers also performed a series of performance dynamic load tests with gradual and abrupt power input changes over half a year of solar radiation. They claim that the tests showed that cell voltage changes are negligible and have a very small impact on PV-EC operation and hydrogen production.
“The next steps towards commercialization of the presented PV-EC system are long-term outdoor stability testing along with longer dynamic load measurement protocols,” they concluded.

The SolarMoves project, commissioned by the European Commission's Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG MOVE), will use data from solar vehicles to study the impact on electrical recharging infrastructure policy and regulations in EU in the coming years.
Throughout the three-year pilot project, cars, trucks, buses, and vans will be equipped with integrated solar panels and sensors to measure and determine solar irradiation in real-world conditions across Europe.
The team, which includes the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE), and EV car manufacturer Sono Motors will model the efficiency of the solar vehicles and then verify that with on-the-road monitoring and testing.
“The results of this monitoring will give insight into the increase in efficiency of electric vehicles when solar technology is integrated and will be used to ascertain the overall potential of this technology and make predictions on the required recharging infrastructure for the potential scenario in which a significant part of the electrical vehicles are equipped with solar modules in the next years,” TNO said in a statement.
The findings of the study will then be translated into a set of policy recommendations for the European Commission.
TNO estimates that electric vehicles with installed solar panels could represent 10% of the entire market by 2030. According to one of its other studies, solar-powered EVs can charge 25% less per year, and up to 40% less in sunny places.
