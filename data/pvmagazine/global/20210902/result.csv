“For a light commercial vehicle charged with the current electricity mix, integrated solar panels can reduce annual CO2 emissions by up to 890kg and reduce operating costs by providing electricity for refrigeration systems,” the panel maker said in a statement. “In buses, with their large roof areas, integrated photovoltaics can provide up to 100% of the HVAC system’s energy needs – especially helpful when the engine is off.”
Called SolFlex, the frameless panel is based on 22%-efficient solar cells and is designed for high, one-sided heat load. The standard product measures 100x100x2.9cm, weighs in at 3.4kg, and has a power output of 170 W. Its open-circuit voltage is 24.23 V and its short-circuit current is 9.55 A. A customized panel may also reach a power output of up to 600 W and have a size of 3,000×1,200×2.9mm.
The module has, also, a bending radius of up to 15 degrees and a scratch-resistant surface. “Innovative interconnection, integrated bypass diodes and half-cell technology ensure optimum yields even with shading and low irradiation,” the manufacturer further explained, adding that the panel can be produced at lower costs, compared to similar products, as it relies on series production located in Changzhou, in China's southern Jiangsu province.
Electric cars incorporating PV panels on their bodywork or roof have the potential of reaching more than 10,000km per year of pure solar-powered driving and the modules could have a payback time of only three or four years, according to a recent study from the Netherlands. The 10,000km range, however, is still difficult to reach for most electric cars that are currently on the market, due to their current vehicle energy efficiency. On the other hand, the benefits of vehicle-integrated PV are proportional to the solar radiation levels of a given area, its demand for electric vehicles, and its power prices.

A study by Indian NGO Climate Trends and U.K. green tech start-up Riding Sunbeams, has suggested self-generated solar power would be an optimal way of helping Indian Railways meet its 2030 net-zero target, given the rapid cut in carbon emissions and cost advantages it would offer.
The document claims up to 28% of the electricity required by Indian Railways trains could come from the state-owned entity's own solar panels, rather than from the grid, provided the entire rail network is electrified.
With Indian Railways planning to install 20 GW of solar generation capacity to help it to net-zero-operations this decade, the authors of the study suggested around 5,272 MW of that project capacity could directly power the company's trains – ensuring at least one in four trains would be powered directly from company-owned PV and eliminating 6.8 million tons of carbon emissions annually.
The direct supply of solar electricity to the network's overhead lines would be more cost-effective for Indian Railways as it would reduce energy transmission and distribution losses, the authors of the study pointed out. The deployment of energy storage trackside would enable even more of Indian Railways' self-generated solar power to feed its trains.
“Right now, India is leading the world on two vital climate frontiers – rail electrification and solar power deployment,” wrote report author and Riding Sunbeams founder Leo Murray. “Our analysis shows that connecting these two keystone low-carbon technologies together in Indian Railways, can drive both India’s economic recovery from the Covid pandemic and its efforts to transition off fossil fuels to tackle the climate crisis.”
Climate Trends director and study co-author Aarti Khosla said: “Indian Railways plays an important role in the lives of every Indian. Not only is it the most practical mode of transportation, it is also the most famous, and the largest employer in the country. The government pumps large sums of money [in] to modernize the railways which, in turn, will play a large role in a net-zero vision of the nation. There has been analysis that converting all diesel locomotives to electric will, indeed, increase … emissions in the short term. However, this report shows the tremendous opportunity of doing it right the first time, by creating a direct connection of the locomotive system to solar PV installations, meeting more than a quarter of the total demand.”
India's coal-dependent power system would also likely entail a rise in emissions as Indian Railways aims to electrify all routes by 2023, the researchers warned.
The report's authors based their calculation of the amount of solar electricity which could directly power trains on the energy demand of the 16 of Indian Railways' 18 network zones for which annual consumption data were available – with the Metro zone centered on Kolkata, and the new, Visakhapatnam-based South Coast Railway the exceptions.
For each zone, train power requirements were matched with regional solar resource potential.
The report's authors found the best five zones for photovoltaic-to-rail potential were the South Central Railway, which includes Hyderabad and features 394 MW of train electricity demand and the potential to host 625 MW of solar generation capacity; the Mumbai-based Central Railway which extends east of the city (299-475 MW); the Delhi-centered Northern Railway (290-459 MW); the Western Railway to the north of Mumbai (280-443 MW); and the Jabalpur-headquartered West Central Railway (278-440 MW).
The North Eastern Railway, which encompasses Lucknow, had the smallest train power demand and, therefore, would only host 117 MW of solar capacity, according to the study.

German PV company Polarstern and the Wilhelm Büchner University have published a study stating that the output power of photovoltaic systems can be increased by up to 8% if they are installed on a green roof. The cooling effect through transpiration and evaporation from the plants, their ability to absorb dust and the diffuse reflection of sunlight through the foliage, are the main factors that determine this performance improvement.
Through various effects such as transpiration and evaporation through the foliage, and the casting of shadows, as well as through the absorption of light for photosynthesis, green roofs have lower ambient temperatures than conventional roofs and, as a result, a PV system's operating temperature is also lower. According to the study, the output power of solar modules may improve by an average of 4.35%. Depending on the technology used and the region, this value may even rise to approximately 8%.
The plants also act like an air filter by absorbing the dust washed off the modules. According to the company's estimates, a green roof binds around two kilograms of fine dust per square meter per year. The amount also depends on the size of the leaf areas and the resistance of the plants to dust. Dust-related energy yield losses in photovoltaic systems in urban regions are assumed at up to 30%.
According to the company, not only the avoidance of dust, but also the reflection of the light by the leaves increases the performance of the solar modules, since these can use more radiation from the solar spectrum. This diffuse reflection causes higher weak-light radiation, which can lead to higher yields, especially with thin-film modules. Citing unspecified field studies, Polarstern said that a green roof can increase irradiation by up to 32%, compared to a gravel roof.
In addition to the increased output of the photovoltaic systems, the green roofs also ensure more biodiversity through the water storage capacity of the floor pan.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/02/the-role-of-chlorine-in-thin-film-solar/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"SEPTEMBER 2, 2021",The role of chlorine in thin film solar,"While silicon-based modules still represent more than 90% of the market, cadmium telluride (CdTe) has long represented the largest share of the remainder, able to claim a few advantages over silicon in certain conditions, as well as a lower carbon footprint in manufacturing.
But CdTe is a little way behind silicon in efficiency terms, and still represents only a small share of the market. First Solar set the efficiency record for CdTe at 22.1% back in 2016, and the technology has seen few improvements on the efficiency side since then.
During manufacturing the CdTe material is treated with chlorine, which raises its efficiency typically from less than 5% up into the 20% range. The exact effect of chlorine in this process, and why the process improves efficiency so dramatically, is not fully understood.
Scientists led by Loughborough University in the UK modeled the process, aiming to understand the mechanism involving chlorine. Previous research had noted that defects in the material known as stacking faults disappeared after the chlorine treatment, and this was thought to be linked to the efficiency increase. The work is described in full in the paper Chlorine activated stacking fault removal mechanism in thin film CdTe solar cells: the missing piece, published in Nature Communications.
The group showed that the efficiency improvement is actually related to grain boundaries in the crystal, and chlorine’s ability to passivate them – so that electrons no longer become ‘trapped’ in the defects, reducing cell efficiency. “Although the stacking faults disappearance is not what causes the improved efficiency, if they have disappeared then that is the signal that the CdTe cell is going to have good performance,” explained Loughborough researcher Pooja Goddard. “This has never been shown before.”
The group hopes that better understanding the job done by chlorine in CdTe manufacturing will open the door to further efficiencies. Its next plan is to investigate doping with other elements and to continue a project that looks to optimize the interfaces between cell layers. The group is targeting cell efficiencies beyond the 25% mark. “Each small gain in efficiency means the technology is becoming more competitive against the current silicon technology,” commented Goddard.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/02/lithium-ion-vs-lead-acid-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,BELGIUM,ETHIOPIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 2, 2021",Lithium-ion vs lead-acid batteries,"A Belgian-Ethiopian research team has compared the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and net present cost (NPC) of lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries for stationary energy storage and has found that the former are, techno-economically, more viable.
The analysis of both storage technologies was modeled through the HOMER software and the Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM), which describes the pure electrical behavior of a battery in terms of voltages, currents, and capacitances. “The ECM model is built-in using electrical components, which respond to the battery electrically,” the scientists explained. “On the other hand, HOMER is software used for the optimization of the components to be used in the grid-connected electrical power system.”
The analysis considered the charge and discharge rate influence on the performance of both kinds of batteries under typical application conditions assuming their use in a grid-connected photovoltaic system (PVGCS) with an inclination angle of 16 degrees and an azimuth angle of 0 degrees. “The system consisted of a 10 kWp photovoltaic array, a grid-connected converter of 5 kW capacity, 83 Ah lead-acid battery storage, and a li-ion battery of 167 Ah with a load having a 4-5 kVA rating,” the group explained, noting that in the simulation, the grid electricity price was estimated at €0.084/kWh.
Citing previous studies, the researchers said that, for stationary energy storage, lead-acid batteries have an average energy capital cost of €253.50/kWh and lithium-ion batteries, €1.555/kWh, and that their total average power cost is €333.50/kWh and €2,210/kWh, respectively. “Furthermore, the environmental impact of lead-acid is categorized as having a high impact, whereas li-ion has a medium/low environmental impact,” they also specified.
Through the simulation, the academics found that li-ion and lead-acid batteries have almost comparable charge and discharge properties but they also ascertained that the lithium-ion devices have the same discharge characteristics response as lead-acid batteries even with less capacity and a lower number of battery units, while also providing longer lifetime characteristics. Moreover, they found that the micro-grid formed by the PV system and the lithium-ion batteries has a net present cost of €14,399, while that of the PV system with lead-acid batteries is around €15,106. As for the LCOE, the latter reached a value of €0.34/kWh and the former, €0.32/kWh.
“The reduced number of batteries affects the per-unit COE and therefore the COE of the micro-grid system with li-ion batteries is lower, as compared to lead-acid batteries,” they further explained, adding that li-ion batteries have lower lifetime costs when associated with PV and reduced losses if compared to lead-acid batteries. “From the investigations, it can be concluded that, the PVGCS system with li-ion batteries requires 40% lesser batteries as compared to lead-acid batteries, and supporting in provision of reliable power supply with lower cost.”
The comparison between the two storage technologies can be found in the paper Techno-economic analysis of lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries in stationary energy storage application, which was recently published in the Journal of Energy Storage. The research group comprises scientists from the Vrije Universiteit Brussels, in Belgium, and the Jimma Institute of Technology, in Ethiopia.

Three English solar developers today announced the formation of a joint venture to develop a 350 MW utility scale solar pipeline in New Zealand, having been attracted by the clear environmental commitments made by Jacinda Ardern‘s government; a lack of the grid congestion which is hobbling PV in neighboring Australia; and high levels of solar irradiation – compared to England, anyway.
Pick up your copy of pv magazine today for an in-depth look at batteries big and small; how they’re changing and how they are changing the world. What do batteries have in store for us? The August edition of pv magazine has answers to the big questions surrounding the battery energy storage revolution.
Hampshire-based Hive Energy today announced the formation of its HES Aotearoa joint venture along with the Exeter-based Ethical Power Group that Hive acquired half of in November, and fellow installer and developer Solar South West, which takes its name from its location in Crewkerne, Somerset, in southwest England.
The press release issued by Hive today did not specify whether the stakes held by each partner would be evenly split and did not indicate any finalized plans for solar farms as yet.
The statement did, however, point to the commitment made by Ardern's Labor government to have an entirely renewables-based electricity system this decade and its decision to stop issuing gas exploration licenses.
Quoted in the press release, Hive CEO Giles Redpath said: “This new joint venture with Ethical Power and Solar South West presents an exciting opportunity to deliver Hive Energy’s mission to support a cleaner, greener future, through its pipeline of nearly 350 MW of solar assets. New Zealand’s excellent natural conditions for solar energy, along with its opportunities for grid connections and support from the government, presents a unique opportunity for HES Aotearoa.”

H2X Global plans to launch its new Warrego pickup truck in Australia’s Gold Coast region, and is already taking orders for the vehicle.
The company says the vehicle features a 200 kW motor system, 66 kW and optional 90 kW fuel cell systems, and 60 kW to 100 kW energy storage systems between its battery and super capacitor units. The Warrego has a 500 km driving range and a refueling time of between three and five minutes.
With its hybrid system, H2X says the vehicle can on pure hydrogen, “drastically” reducing refueling time, while increasing driving range and hydrogen efficiency.
The company describes the Warrego as the first in a “range of uniquely designed and developed fuel cell electric vehicles” it plans to release over the next 24 months.
In November 2020, H2X Marine – the boat-building unit of the fledgling automotive manufacturer – announced a partnership with Queensland-based shipbuilding specialist WildCat Marine to manufacture a range of hydrogen-fueled passenger ferries for industrial and commercial use.
Fuel cell vehicles are expected to face an uphill battle when competing with more mature electric vehicle technologies for light vehicles and passenger cars. However, there is much interest in using hydrogen to transport heavy trucks, ferries, ships and planes.

BusinessToday reported that the Indian group would be ready to pay $1 billion to $1.2 billion to acquire REC Solar. The news outlet claimed that Reliance Industries is already in talks with several unspecified lenders to secure $500 million to $600 million of funds to support the transaction.
“We are in general not commenting on market rumors,” a spokesperson from REC Solar told pv magazine.
Reliance Industries said in a statement to the National Stock Exchange of India that it would not comment on the BusinessToday report, which was published on Tuesday.
“We are unable to comment on media speculation and rumors and it would be inappropriate on our part to do so,” it said. “The company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis.”
Reliance Industries focuses on the energy, petrochemical, natural gas, retail, telecoms, mass media, and textiles industries. In late June, it announced plans to invest $8.1 billion over the next three years to build gigafactories for solar, energy storage, electrolyzers, and fuel cells. The planned facilities include an integrated PV module factory, an advanced energy storage battery factory, an electrolyzer factory for the production of green hydrogen, and a fuel cell factory to convert hydrogen into power. 
REC Solar has currently a production capacity of around 1.8 GW and plans to build a 4 GW heterojunction PV module factory in France.
