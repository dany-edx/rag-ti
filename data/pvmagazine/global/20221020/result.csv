Mondragon Assembly, a manufacturer of turnkey lines adaptable to any existing need in the solar industry, has received a multi-gigawatt order from BVG India.
The first phase of the project includes an automated 500 MW solar panel manufacturing line. It will start producing M10 half-cut cells from the start. The line, which will be operational in the second quarter of 2023, is designed to produce more than 2,000 modules per day.
“Given that PV cell and module technologies are changing so rapidly, this line will be fully upgradable to the latest generation modules and cell sizes between M3 and M12 and up to 15BB; and it has the option of producing glass-glass and/or glass-backsheet modules,” Mondragon Assembly told pv magazine.
The panels will go to projects in India and other countries, according to Pankaj Dhingra, director of BVG India.
“There are high demand for high-quality, high-voltage modules in India and in countries such as the United States, Europe, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand,” said Dhingra. “With this new line we want to take advantage of this market situation, making EPC projects feasible to develop with quality and competitive prices.”

“The module configuration makes it possible to install PV systems on narrow roofs, which are common in Japanese houses,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “We are planning to sell the first panels in winter and we are initially targeting the Japanese market.”
The Volturbo panels measure  1,760 mm × 768 mm× 30 mm and weigh 14.8 kg. They feature 275 W of power output, an efficiency of 20.3%, and a temperature coefficient of -0.33%/C.
“The panel has also an open-circuit voltage of 49.8 V, a short-circuit current of 7.0 A, and a fill factor of 78.89%,” the spokesperson said.
According to Xsol, the modules enable the installation of PV systems across different roof sections, as the modules can be installed in two-panel rows.
“This will enable the deployment of the solar modules on roofs where it was previously impossible,” the spokesperson claimed.
The company said the new product is a response to a Tokyo metropolitan government initiative. The city plans to make solar energy mandatory for all newly built houses.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/20/three-junction-iii-v-solar-cell-with-29-3-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 20, 2022",Three-junction III-V solar cell with 29.3% efficiency,"Researchers led by Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) have fabricated a three-junction solar cell based on indium gallium phosphide (InGaP), gallium arsenide (GaAS) and copper, indium, gallium and selenium (CIGS) with a mechanical stacked design. 
“We are currently increasing our efforts to improve the cell efficiency and the development of the mass production technology,” researcher Kikuo Makita told pv magazine, noting that this kind of cell has the potential to achieve efficiencies close to 35%.
The scientists built the cell with a two-junction InGap-GaAs upper cell with a bandgap of 1.49 eV, based on a rear-emitter heterojunction structure developed by Japanese manufacturer Sharp, and a CIGS bottom device with a bandgap of 1.01 eV, with improved surface roughness. They connected the cells through a modified smart stack with palladium (Pd) nanoparticles and adhesive. 
The research group improved the bottom cell's surface via wet etching. They used a bromine-based solution and modified its thin transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layer.
“Surface roughness leads to an increase in the gap width at the bonding interface,” they explained, noting that this roughness, combined with the TCO thickness may lead to reflection loss. “Therefore, in this study, we focused on minimizing surface roughness and TCO thickness.”
The academics tested the performance of the cell under standard illumination conditions. They found it achieved a power conversion efficiency of 29.3% for the aperture area (31.0% for the active area), an open-circuit voltage of 2.97 V, a short-circuit current density of 12.41 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 0.80.
They said the obtained efficiency of 29.3% is superior to that of the group's previous results. They claimed it was the highest value ever reported for any two-terminal GaAs.CIGSe-based multijunction solar cell.
“We examined the costs of the cells using Smart stack technology and, according to our simulation, they may result in a final module cost of US$ 2/W,” Makita said. “GaAs cell cost, CIGSe cell cost, bonding cost, and modulization cost are 86%, 7%, 3%, and 4%, respectively.
The GaAs cell, especially the GaAs substrate and GaAs epi-growth, is the main factor affecting device-fabrication costs.
“In our project, device epitaxial lift-off (ELO) and substrate reuse techniques are studied to reduce the GaAs substrates costs,” Makite said. “In addition, the AIST has developed a hydride vapor phase epitaxy (H-VPE), which is a new growth method for GaAs cells. H-VPE is a low-cost technique compared to the general metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) technique. We think that the development of these fabrication technologies contributes to the cost reduction of expensive GaAs cells.”
The researchers presented the cell design in “Mechanical stacked GaAs//CuIn1−yGaySe2 three-junction solar cells with 30% efficiency via an improved bonding interface and area current-matching technique,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. The cost of producing solar cells based on compounds of III-V element materials – named according to the groups of the periodic table that they belong to – has confined such devices to niche applications, including drones and satellites, where low weight and high efficiency are more pressing concerns than costs in relation to the energy produced.
Fraunhofer ISE researchers recently achieved a 35.9% conversion efficiency for a III-V monolithic triple-junction solar cell based on silicon. In August 2020, the research institute announced a 25.9% conversion efficiency rate for a III-V tandem solar cell grown directly on silicon. This cell is a modified version of a 34.5%-efficient III-V solar cell that is manufactured through a process known as direct wafer bonding, where the III-V layers are first deposited on an aluminum gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate and then pressed together.
Researchers at Tampere University in Finland recently developed a III-V multi-junction solar cell that purportedly has the potential to reach a power conversion efficiency of close to 50%. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the United States announced  a 32.9% efficiency for a tandem cell device utilizing III-V materials last year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/20/poland-installed-3-3-gw-of-solar-in-january-august-period/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,POLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 20, 2022",Poland installed 3.3 GW of solar in January-August period,"Agencja Rynku Energii (ARE), the energy agency of Poland, has reported that the country reached 11.03 GW of cumulative installed PV capacity at the end of August.
According to the figures released by the agency, the country deployed around 3.36 GW in the first eight months of this year. For comparison, it installed around 3.71 GW in full 2021. “The Polish PV market is dominated by the prosumer segment, which includes all systems not exceeding 50 kW in size,” Piotr Pająk, a renewables reporter for the Gramwzielone website, told pv magazine. “The total capacity of prosumer installations was 8.25 GW in the end of August which means it is 75% of the total PV capacity installed in Poland.”
According to Pająk, recent changes in the country's regulations for the distributed generation segment have not interrupted its strong growth trajectory. “For new prosumers, net-billing was introduced and any experts expected the new system to be less profitable than the old mechanism – and those voices largely caused a decrease in new prosumer investments,” he stressed. “However, the current huge rise of energy prices in the wholesale market is generating very attractive income for prosumers in net-billing.”
 He also stressed that the rise in energy prices is also a driver for PV investments in companies that want to cut their energy bills. “Except for the rooftop segment, the other driver for the Polish PV market is the segment of ground-mounted farms. Partially this segment is still developing thanks to the auction system, but now more and more investors decide to build PV farms outside the mechanism and sell the energy on the market,” he also stated.
Poland had reached 7.67 GW of 3.9 GW of cumulative solar capacity by the end of 2021, 3.9 GW at the end of 2020, 1.3 GW at the end of 2019, and just 486 MW at the end of 2018. The exponential growth recorded last year was mainly due to the growing number of grid-connected solar parks.
The Polish PV market is expected to grow strongly during the current decade to reach 30 GW of installed capacity by the end of 2030, according to the Polish research institute Instytut Energetyki Odnawialnej (IEO).

In its optimal scenario, BNEF said that 5 GW of solar, 5.7 GW of wind, 1 GW of storage and 0.1 GW of thermal capacity could replace 80% of Belchatow’s generating capacity, which stood at 5.1 GW in 2021.
BNEF based its analysis on local weather patterns and land availability. It said this combination would result in the highest economic value. In Poland, electricity produced by PV is reportedly about 50% cheaper than lignite.
“BNEF analysis finds that the cheapest electricity mix in Poland can be achieved when wind and solar account for most of overall generation and more expensive, flexible technologies generate only during the few hours or days when wind and solar output is low,” said the company.
It also said that a solar and wind combination has the potential to create a better overall generation profile than either technology on its own.
“Solar and wind in the region often generate at different times, complementing each other,” said Felicia Aminoff, energy transition analyst at BNEF and the lead author of the report.
The greatest challenge for the optimal scenario in terms of solar is its significant use of land. To install 5 GW of utility-scale PV, Belchatow’s land would have to be reclaimed, given that the lignite fields would be flooded with water once mining ends. In a “land-constrained” scenario, BNEF estimates that 3.6 GW of solar, 2.9 GW of wind, and 1.5 GW of thermal capacity could replace 80% of the plant’s total generation, based on 2021 levels.
BNEF said that Polish lignite generation will drop by 75% between 2021 and 2030, with the resource likely to run out by 2036. That will force the plant to shut down unless it transitions to other power sources.
The report also looks at technologies that could be deployed in Belchatow after 2030, including green hydrogen, floating solar, pumped hydro storage, and small nuclear reactors (SMRs).
“The construction of new, low-emission sources in the Bełchatów region must be started as soon as possible in order to maintain the security of energy supply at a high level and reduce electricity prices,” said Joanna Maćkowiak-Pandera, CEO of Forum Energii.

The sum collected through the funding round, which also involved Argentina's Techint Group, will add to the $4.58 million grant that Quino Energy had previously secured from the US Department of Energy (DoE).
The company said it will use the funds to scale up its redox flow battery technology based on 2,6-dihydroxy-anthraquinone (DHAQ) – or more simply, anthraquinone or quinone.
“Harvard’s Office of Technology Development (OTD) has granted Quino Energy an exclusive, worldwide license to commercialize energy storage systems using the chemistry identified by the labs, including quinone or hydroquinone compounds as the active materials in the electrolyte,” the startup said. “Quino’s founders believe the system may offer game-changing advantages in cost, safety, stability, and power.”
The company designed the battery based on previous research conducted by 16 scientists from the University of Cambridge and Harvard University. Quinone as the active material in the electrolyte eliminates the typical decomposition of chemically unstable redox-active species in redox flow batteries, which is the main factor affecting the storage capacity of such storage devices.
In the redox flow battery, DHAQ decomposes slowly over time, regardless of how many times battery cycles have been performed. When it is in contact with the air, after a cycle, this molecule absorbs oxygen and turns back into its original status.
For this reason, the researchers refer to the molecule as a “zombie quinone,” as it is kind of returning to life after being dead. They said redox flow batteries developed via this approach could offer a net lifetime that is 17 times longer than previous research has shown.
“For grid-scale stationary storage, you want to be able to run your city through the night and when the wind isn’t blowing, without burning fossil fuels. You might go two or three days without wind in a typical weather pattern, and you’ll certainly go eight hours without sunshine, so having a discharge duration at rated power of five to 20 hours can be a very useful thing,” Quino Energy said. “That’s the sweet spot for flow batteries, where we think they can be especially competitive versus the shorter-duration lithium-ion batteries.”

The first grid-scale solar plant in Australia, the Greenough River Solar Farm near Geraldton, Western Australia, has now notched a decade of operations, as it was officially opened in October 2012.
The original 10 MW Greenough River Solar Farm was the nation’s first large-scale solar PV power project when it was commissioned, but it has since been dwarfed by the increasingly large utility-scale solar projects appearing on Australia’s landscape. In the decade since the Greenough River Solar Farm went online, more than 100 large-scale solar projects totaling almost 7 GW of generation capacity have been connected to the grid.
In the past year alone, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has registered 29 new generation and storage projects totaling 4 GW of capacity, including what is now Australia’s largest solar farm, a 400 MW power plant being developed in Queensland by the Australian arm of French renewables developer Neoen.
The 400 MW project, which is now exporting to the grid, forms part of Neoen’s AUD 600 million ($375.3 million) Western Downs Green Power Hub.
The Greenough River Solar Farm was developed by Western Australian state-owned energy generator and retailer Synergy and GE Energy Financial Services. It was later acquired in 2018 by Bright Energy Investments (BEI), a joint venture between Synergy, the Dutch Infrastructure Fund, and Construction Building Union Superannuation.
The original 10 MW first stage of the solar farm comprises 150,000 Series 3 thin-film 85 W PV panels supplied by US module producer First Solar. The panels were mounted on fixed racking.

Engie and the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (INRAE) have inaugurated the Camelia vertical agrivoltaic pilot in central France.
The project features 252 vertical bifacial panels, oriented east/west, with an installed power of 89 kW and an expected annual production of 100 MWh. The nine vertical rows are spread over 1 hectare and are spaced 12 meters and 18 meters apart. The installation is equipped with a simple, modular and reversible anchoring system, to minimize its impact on agriculture.
Engie invested €1 million ($0.98 million) in the project. It aims to study the impact of vertically installed bifacial PV modules on grasslands and electricity production.
Camelia is installed on a plot of land that belongs to INRAE. It is also equipped with 50 sensors for agronomic and meteorological monitoring.
“The Camelia project makes it possible to address original research questions in agrivoltaics, such as the effect of the construction site on soil compaction, the effects of vertical panels on the microclimate of the meadow and on the animals,” said INRAE President Emmanuel Hugo. “The response of the grassland will be compared with a control grassland in the immediate vicinity of the site.”
The pilot project also involves a local dairy producer, whose electricity needs are partly covered by Camelia.

For this purpose, we launched Q Energy on July 1. It’s comprised of three companies – a Berlin based holding company and two subsidiaries, which combine experience from more than 20 years of successful projects, particularly in solar and wind. On top of these, we will also engage in energy storage and later in green hydrogen, and act as an independent power producer.
Our goal is to accelerate the deployment of renewable energies in Europe across all market segments. This is the only way forward to lower carbon emissions while at the same time reaching higher energy independence. We are convinced that Q Energy is entering the scene at exactly the right point in time to be part of the solution for Europe’s energy challenges.
These are our core markets, and we see great opportunities in all of them. The annual installation volumes of large-scale PV and wind capacities will have to grow significantly if these countries want to reach their goals of reducing carbon emissions by 2030 and beyond. Installation targets for solar and other renewables look promising. However, we call upon the national governments to further remove obstacles and dramatically de-complicate permitting procedures.
Take Germany: The government has announced the target to increase accumulated PV installations by roughly 155 GW in less than nine years, of which about 50% are supposed to be large scale PV. We strongly support the target and see first positive measures. However, the permitting times between acquiring the land and actually putting the plant into operation have to significantly decrease from today’s reality of two to four years.
We hope not. It is true that prices for modules, mounting systems and substations are increasing, but so are electricity prices and revenue potentials in general. This should balance the effects of higher material cost. Current political measures to mitigate the energy price crisis also come into play. Short-term visibility and plannability are low. But in the long run, accelerating the deployment of renewable energy can solve our problems and that is what we are committed to.
The current price increases in PV are a direct result of Covid-19 and the unstable geopolitical situation. In this sense, they are part of a general trend and not an industry-specific issue. The biggest challenge for the sector in the coming years will be about satisfying the growing global hunger for reliable PV systems, while at the same time ensuring that solar energy will remain the cheapest way of producing and consuming electricity.
Being part of a global company like Hanwha is an advantage in many respects – bankability of course, but also regarding its prowess in sustainable high-tech materials for green energy solutions. Regarding solar modules, however, it will be important for us to ensure a diversified supplier portfolio. While QCells is our sister company and a potential module supplier, we are independent in our decision making. We will purchase solar modules from the free market according to the usual competitive criteria like quality, availability, and price.
Q Energy is expanding into these markets at exactly the right point in time. All three show great untapped potentials for large-scale PV, wind and storage projects and Q Energy will leverage them in the coming years. In fact, just recently we entered into an agreement to co-develop 21 projects in the Netherlands – a portfolio of around 300 MW in total. We have also secured the first development project in the UK.
On the PV side, most of our projects are ground mounted, some of which use trackers, like in Spain, some fixed, like in France. Energy storage solutions in combination with PV are already a reality and will become even more important in the coming years: In Portugal, around 300 MW of our projects will combine PV with energy storage; the UK is attractive for storage solutions as well. And France is not only one of our most important markets, but also an innovation hub: Just recently, we received the green light to go ahead with the largest floating PV project in France on a former quarry. With a pipeline of 200 MW of floating projects Q Energy is already one of the main players in this sector in France.
We are convinced that green hydrogen will play a major role in the future, and we are actively pursuing it. The markets for green hydrogen still need to mature, but we will certainly engage in green hydrogen projects in the coming years.
The idea of growing crops while shading the plants and producing clean energy simultaneously is indeed intriguing. What will be important for its expansion though is simple and clear regulation all the way down to the community level. The situation really differs from country to country. In France we are already active in that niche. Over the summer, we inaugurated our first two prototypes. One of them, a so called hydrovoltaic prototype, will even cover the watering of the plants.
We’re closely monitoring Germany for its agrivoltaic potential as well. While the German government promotes the idea, the measures in the revised EEG are not yet enough to create a competitive business model. The current bonus scheme applies only to horizontal agrivoltaic projects within regular tenders. However, the projects won’t be competitive against regular ground mounted projects. Instead, special concepts like agrivoltaics, but also floating PV, should go into dedicated tenders.

The presented their findings in “Recent advances in synchronization techniques for grid-tied PV system: A review,” which was recently published in Energy Reports. They described all synchronization techniques for installations with single-phase or three-phase inverters. They also provided a framework of all grid-tied architectures and topologies for PV systems.
“This paper helps to provide a basic conceptual framework to develop a superior grid-tied system,” they said. “Synchronization is a crucial problem in grid-tied inverters operation and control research indicates that frequency, phase, and amplitude of voltage are the most crucial parameters that need to be measured and controlled for grid-tied application.”
They noted open loop and closed loop techniques. Open loop techniques can directly detect input signals parameters, while closed loop techniques can reportedly reduce phase errors.
“In closed loop system estimated value of phase is updated adjusting through a feedback loop mechanism. This loop locks the estimated value of signal to its actual value,” they said. “Closed loop techniques are a better as compared to open loop method.”
In closed loop systems, the phase locked loop (PLL) technique as a popular way to create reference current. A PLL is a system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to its input. It is commonly used to modulate, demodulate, filter or recover a signal from noisy communications channels.
“PLL is a non-linear feedback control system that freezes its output signal to input signal keeping constant minimum phase error(s). The block diagram of PLL consists of phase-detector (PD), a loop-filter (LF) and a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO),” the scientists said. “There are some new techniques reviewed in the literature found to have better performance than conventional PLL, yet PLL is widely accepted for its robustness and simplicity.”
The academics concluded by saying that the right choice between all existing PLLs and synchronization algorithms could be difficult. They said more attention should be paid to converter topologies and technologies.
“Equivalently, utilizing artificial intelligence methods in hybrid with the conventional techniques can achieve more popularity and achievements in future research,” they said. “More attention should be given for robust grid interconnection during weak grid conditions.”
