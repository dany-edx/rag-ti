Bosch said it will invest a total of €100 million in a heat pump factory in Aveiro near Porto, Portugal, by the end of 2026.
The sum will be used to finance new laboratories, two production buildings, and additional heat pump production lines. The group said it also wants to create an unspecified number of new jobs there in the medium term.
Along with Eibelshausen near Marburg and Tranås in Sweden, Aveiro is one of the most important sites in Bosch's development and production network for heat pumps. The group wants to invest €1 billion in this segment by the end of the decade.
In April, Bosch said it would invest €225 million in setting up a production facility for heat pumps in Poland.
The Bosch Home Comfort Group has been developing and producing hot water heating technologies in Aveiro for many years. At the facility, Bosch manufactures the outdoor units and wall-mounted indoor units for the new, according to the manufacturer, particularly quiet generation of heat pumps Compress 5800i AW and Compress 6800i AW with the environmentally friendly refrigerant propane.
A production line for the indoor unit for this new product line started in Eibelshausen, Germany, at the beginning of the year. Some of the outdoor units are also produced in Tranås, Sweden. For the Compress 5800i AW, the manufacturer also offers an electricity meter/sensor that makes it possible to combine the heat pumps with any existing photovoltaic system and battery storage solution in the house.
“Our engineers, researchers and developers work hand in hand within our manufacturing network and develop heat pumps that are state-of-the-art in technology,” said Jan Brockmann, CEO of the Bosch Home Comfort Group. “With the high investments and further expansion in Aveiro, we are driving forward electrification in the building and combining living comfort with green technology.”

The 15 kW Picea 2 system offers 1,500 kWh of storage capacity. The company said it doubled the system output to meet the higher demand caused by the growing use of electric cars and heat pumps. It also increased the maximum connected load for PV systems.
HPS Home Power Solutions said that the Picea 2 is 70% lighter than its previous model. The overall height is also lower, in order to simplify installation. The system can now also be installed in rooms with very low ceilings.
The device is also equipped with new, more efficient power electronics, said HPS Home Power Solutions.
The Picea devices serve as seasonal storage for solar power. In summer, an integrated electrolyzer uses the excess energy from the PV system to produce green hydrogen, which is stored on-site. In winter, the electrolysis process basically runs backwards, so that the hydrogen is converted into electricity again in fuel cell mode.
HPS raised €22 million ($23.4 million) in a financing round earlier this year.
“Our growth strategy is to reach the market together with installation companies as quickly as possible,” said HPS Home Power Solutions CEO Zeyad Abul-Ella. “With all the improvements, especially those that make the installation process easier, we have created important conditions for long-term partnerships.”

If you look back just 20 years in the US solar industry, 1 MW was the total amount of solar being installed on an annual basis. Now, in 2023, the US market may exceed 30 GW in one year! As megawatts have grown to gigawatts the inverter market has diversified and matured, but bigger inverters aren’t necessarily the growing trend. Central inverters still dominate the US utility solar market but string inverters are beginning to get more traction in 10+ MW projects.  
“When a central inverter goes down for anything more than minor maintenance, it takes down several MWs of generation potential with it,” said Clēnera CEO Jason Ellsworth. “The prolonged downtime for repair or replacement can be detrimental to project performance.”
Earlier this summer, Clēnera – a Boise, Idaho-based solar developer and asset manager – began commercial operation of Apex Solar, a 105 MW (DC) solar project in Beaverhead County in southwestern Montana. The project is contracted to NorthWestern Energy under a 20-year power purchase agreement and is expected to generate carbon-free power equivalent to the annual consumption of 13,500 households. Unlike most of Clēnera’s previous projects that use central inverters, the Apex Solar plant is utilizing 275 kW (AC) string inverters made by CPS America.  
Advantages of string inverters include their relatively small size and weight, the ability of the project owner to store spare replacement inverters on-site, and the lower production losses when an inverter goes down.
“As a company, we are aggressively seeking innovations that improve reliability. At Apex, string inverters are just one of the steps we’ve taken to ensure maximum reliability and performance,” said Ellsworth. “As a long-term owner and operator, we care deeply about the lifetime performance of each project.  We will continue to find ways to improve reliability, enhance performance, and extend the lifetime on all our projects.”
In the dynamic landscape of the utility-scale solar market, which is anticipated to reach 23 GW of deployment in 2023, agility is paramount. In a recent interview with the CPS America’s leadership team at RE+ in Las Vegas where 40,000 energy professionals gathered, Bryan Wagner noted CPS’s “Lightspeed system” that bridges communication across its diverse departments, from R&D to sales to service. This nimbleness, he argues, translates to annual product evolutions, moving CPS’s inverter market share from a modest 2% to 3% five years ago to their current market share of 8%. 
In 2016 GTM predicted that string inverters would achieve 20% market penetration in US utility solar by 2022. Globally, the penetration of string inverters into utility solar is already 50% according to some sources.
According to CPS Global, string inverters are adopted at 80-90% of all their projects in some European and Asian countries.
“The Apex Solar Farm project is a testament to CPS‘s commitment to integrate the benefits of string into utility scale projects like Apex Solar and we couldn’t be more excited that Clēnera put their trust in CPS America on this project,” said Wagner.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/02/new-attempt-to-build-solar-cells-based-on-gallium-arsenide-nitrogen-bismuth/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,FINLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 2, 2023",New attempt to build solar cells based on gallium-arsenide-nitrogen-bismuth,"A group of scientists from the Tampere University in Finland and the Leibniz-Institut im Forschungsverbund Berlin e.V research center in Germany have designed a low bandgap solar cell based on a gallium-arsenide-nitrogen-bismuth (GaAsNBi) absorber.
“In terms of bandgap energy and solar cell performance achieved, these results are far from the expectation, reflecting the difficulty in synthesizing GaAs-based high quality compound semiconductor heterostructures incorporating Bi, and the early development stage of the field,” the researchers stated.
They explained that their device is intended to be used as a bottom device in a multi-junction PV cell. Their attempt to build a GaAsNBi solar cell follows scientists at Osaka University in Japan unveiling a 2.01%-efficient device with a 1.15 eV bandgap in 2021.
Challenges facing the efficacy of the new cell type include the “unconventional” growth conditions required for Bi and N incorporation, which may lead to a “large” number of defects, according to the paper. Incorporating Bi in GaAs needs low growth temperatures and carefully controlled V/III flux ratios. To solve this, the academics grew the GaAs layers using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), which is an evaporation technique implemented in an ultra-high vacuum for decomposing compounds with extreme regularity of layer thickness and composition.
They fabricated three 6 × 6 mm2 solar cells with an active area of 0.25 cm2. The devices were processed from an As-grown wafer. “The pieces were selected to cover an area with As/Ga flux ratio between 0.82 and 1.20,” the scientists said. “Due to technical limitations, the orientation of the substrate was not controlled before growth of the GaAsNBi layer.”
The performance of the device was assessed through external quantum efficiency (EQE) and light-current-voltage (LIV) measurements under standard solar illumination conditions. EQE is the ratio of the number of energy carriers harvested by the solar cell to the number of photons of a given energy incident on the cell itself.
With this cell configuration, the group was reportedly able to minimize its energy bandgap to 0.86 eV, which in turn resulted in a minimized lattice mismatch.
“Increasing As/Ga over the stoichiometric ratio leads to a rapid increase in the tensile mismatch and bandgap energy, likely due to reduction in Bi incorporation,” the academics said. “Despite a slightly higher open-circuit voltage offset at high As/Ga, this also leads to an (sic) clear increase in the external quantum efficiency and short-circuit current, suggesting significant differences in the carrier collection efficiencies.”
The paper claimed that these findings will encourage the viability of GaAsNBi PV devices for use in multi-junction solar cells. The paper, titled “Low bandgap GaAsNBi solar cells,” was published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.
In 2021 the same Tampere University research group unveiled a solar cell made of gallium-indium-nitride-arsenide-antimony (GaInNAsSb) incorporating gold-based back-surface reflectors. The cell had a “p-i-n” layout and an energy bandgap close to 0.8 eV, and was grown through MBE.
That same year a different group of Tampere University researchers announced they developed a III-V multi-junction solar cell, which allegedly has the potential to reach near-50% power conversion efficiency.

The PVmover system, which was already deployed at an unspecified location in northern Germany earlier this year, hosts nine PV modules and has a capacity of 3.8 kW.
The manufacturer said the system can be set up quickly and in a standardized manner using ground anchors, with no need to pour foundations and wait for the concrete to harden. The ground anchors can reportedly withstand high tensile loads and can be easily removed at the end of the system lifecycle without leaving any residue.
The biaxial tracking PVmover can purportedly generate more electricity than conventional PV systems without trackers. Its height of under 3 meters allows for installation in Germany without requiring building permits.
Moving in two axes, this ground-mounted device has specific dimensions, including a circular area of 33 square meters with a 6.5-meter diameter, a height of 2.98 meters, and a width of 5.4 meters, allowing for one-day installation.
“The PVmovers follow the sun from east to west and also adjust their angle of inclination to the sun,” the company said in a press release. “As a result, they generate significantly more energy than permanently installed solar systems. Due to the tracking, the PVmovers generate approx. 30% more electricity in Germany compared to optimally south-facing, permanently installed PV modules, and approx. 50% more electricity compared to east-west-facing modules.”
The company also produces a smaller dual-axis tracking solar tracker, the PVmover 18. This model includes four PV modules with a capacity of 1.7 kW. It requires a circular area of 12.5 square meters, with a diameter of 4 meters.
In addition, it has developed a concentrating solar technology based on parabolic mirrors that can achieve a 75% efficiency in converting direct radiation into heat. It is currently producing the devices at its facility at the GreenTEC campus in Enge-Sande, Germany.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/02/new-research-suggests-renewables-may-not-necessarily-foster-democracy-peace/,"MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRIA,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 2, 2023","New research suggests renewables may not necessarily foster democracy, peace","A group of researchers led by the University of Erfurt have found that there is “no support” for the widely held belief that renewable energy generation can foster peace and reduce conflict.
“We find no evidence for the ‘peace through prosperity’ argument,” the academics – Juergen Braunstein, Andreas Goldthau and Konstantin Veit – wrote in their published paper.
“Even if states deploy renewables at a large scale, the lack of an ‘energy democracy effect’ suggests they may not necessarily abstain from going to war thanks to embracing distributed energy systems at home.”
Geopolitical experts often argue that renewable energy sources, due to their distributed nature, may lead to global stability. It is suggested that these energy sources can reduce conflicts between nations by either encouraging individual countries to become more self-sufficient or by increasing cooperation between neighboring countries. These nations may find technical and economic advantages in sharing their resources, which may lead to peaceful outcomes.
The three academics put this theory – of peace through prosperous renewable energy generation – to the test by conducting a series of statistical assessments using data from a range of sources. This includes information from Thompson Reuters SDC Platinum, the World Bank's Varieties of Democracy, the World Bank’s Governance Indicators and the Human Development Index (HDI) of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
“Using a longitudinal dataset on global renewable energy investment, econometric tests suggest that distributed renewable energy systems do not seem to foster democratic rule, nor do they have a significant influence on human development,” the academics stated.
Although the researchers wrote that it is “hard to test” the assertion of the ability of renewables to foster peace and democracy, and more research is required, they found that this ability is impacted by the location and utilization of renewable energy generation plants. “It makes a difference whether renewables are deployed in a conflict-prone setting or a politically stable environment,” they also said.
They also found that clean energies foster peace in areas where renewable investments are “concentrated” rather than distributed. “With this, a core assumption of the energy democracy literature is put in question, that is renewables redistributing power to local communities and individuals, and by extension foster democratic rule at the national level,” the paper stated.
They also found that deploying renewables does not necessarily lead to a country or region's economic development. “The hypothesis based on the capitalist peace rationale needs to be rejected: as per the statistical test, renewables do not seem to induce development and therefore lower the level and likelihood of conflict,” the paper stated.
Although their research shows that renewables do not have a pacifying effect on democracy or human security, these energy sources may be relevant for peace and stability through other mechanisms. It also may take time to see their long-term impacts, the paper stated.
The researchers published their findings in the paper “Does climate action bring peace? Assessing the geopolitics of renewables using global investment data,” published in npj climate action.

“The end of construction of the factory is in January, we need then five months to install the industrial part,” HDF Energy CEO Damien Havard told pv magazine.
The hydrogen fuel cell plant is waiting for support from the European authorities. The facility has been pre-listed as an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI).
“The European Commission is closing the third wave of IPCEIs. HDF Energy is part of the fourth wave. We hope to reach the final agreement with European authorities in the beginning of 2024,” said Havard. “These subsidies will be used to deploy fuel cells for train and marine markets.”
The company has a diversified strategy. It said it is focused on proposing power-to-power and hydrogen-to-power solutions “worldwide,” in order to supply baseload renewable electricity to grid operators.
In non-EU-countries, it will also be a developer of renewable installations and a producer of green hydrogen infrastructure geared toward the production of low-carbon hydrogen.
“We will be our own first clients,” said Havard.
Havard noted that HDF Energy is working on projects in 30 countries. He said the first project under construction is in French Guyana, followed by Indonesia and Barbados.
“Our turnkey hydrogen power plant in French Guyana will supply green, stable baseload electricity by integrating an intermittent renewable energy source (a solar park) with substantial on-site energy storage in the form of green hydrogen, which will be transformed again in electricity through our fuel cell systems,” said Havard. “We are currently constructing the project to deliver 10 MW a day and 3 MW a night. We reached financial closing 18 months ago.”
In Indonesia, HDF Energy wants to become a developer and the operator of hydrogen and electricity production facilities.
“In Indonesia, we signed an MoU with the local grid operator to deploy 22 projects for more than 2 billion euros. It is an official partnership,” said Havard. “It is an important milestone because the Indonesian grid operator does not sign MoUs all the time, maybe one or two a year.”
HDF Energy also has a power-to-power project in Namibia, which will produce green electricity for local use.
“We need to sign a PPA, finalize the investment and start the construction,” said Havard. “We hope to finalize the investment next year.”
He noted that HDF Energy focuses on power-to-power solutions in South America, Africa and Asia because such projects do not need subsidies.
“On the other hand, in Europe, most of our developments are aimed to offtake hydrogen supplied by others, and transform it into electricity on demand (peak or baseload) integrating our multi-MW  fuel cell systems,” said Havard. “There are enough hydrogen producers in Europe for now. We will deploy our first hydrogen-to-power projects in Europe in 2028-30.”
The company is also betting on proton exchange membrane electrolysis (PEM) technologies, but does not see a problem in a reliance on critical materials.
“It is a preoccupation, but not a big risk,” concluded Havard.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/02/solar-on-farmland-rather-than-nuclear-should-shape-italys-energy-mix/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY",,"NOVEMBER 2, 2023","Solar on farmland, rather than nuclear, should shape Italy’s energy mix","Italy's journey towards a sustainable energy mix seems unlikely to include nuclear, at least in the foreseeable future.
While nuclear energy has the potential to underpin a robust low-carbon electricity strategy, Italy's resolute opposition to nuclear technology, expressed in a 2011 referendum where 95% of voters rejected it, serves as a significant roadblock. Digging further into the past, it is possible to recall the vehement protests that marked the early 2000s and which centered on the construction of a nuclear waste storage site in Scanzano Jonico, in Basilicata. Those events collectively underscored the deep-rooted apprehension held by the Italian public about nuclear energy.
Even putting public sentiment aside, nuclear power is far from simple to implement. Building a nuclear plant is a protracted process, spanning 7-15 years, contingent on variables including size and technology and accompanied by a substantial price tag, currently estimated at around $15 billion per gigawatt of generation capacity.
As we stand today, it appears exceedingly unlikely that a new nuclear facility commissioned today would meet a 2030 climate policy deadline, based solely on construction timelines. When considering the time required for a national education campaign to alter the negative public perception of nuclear, to overcome Italy's intricate planning and permitting hurdles, and then allowing for potential construction delays, the prospect of an operational new nuclear power plant by the significant net zero economy deadline of 2050 begins to fade. Italy's track record of failing to realize ambitious projects, such as the infamous Bridge of the Strait of Messina, underscores this pattern.
Salvini's pre-election announcements about nuclear have, unfortunately, created further uncertainty in a market that is already fraught with risk for prospective renewable energy investors. Italy has an extremely opaque permitting process which has resulted in historically long waiting times for developers and, recently, very low approval rates. In 2022, fewer than 1% of solar farms received a permit to build, with a backlog of 1,364 renewables projects awaiting evaluation in the country.
To reach its 2030 climate targets, Italy must install no less than 10 GW of clean power generation capacity per year until that date, the lion’s share of which are expected to be solar. Last year, the country installed 3.04 GW of solar.
The shortfall stems primarily from the complex layering of local, regional, and national regulations, which differ from town to town and region to region. At a country-wide level, the criteria applied for permitting processes are inconsistent and permits are often denied for esoteric reasons – a notable example was the 30 MW agrivoltaic farm in the Marche region that was blocked due to worries about the impact this would have on the agricultural industry in the area.
Over the last few years, the government has introduced a series of regulations aimed at simplifying the approvals process for solar. These have gone so far as to enable the construction of solar on reclaimed mines and landfills without the need for permits – land categorized as “edilizia libera,” or free construction. There is a considerable shortage of such sites available in Italy, however. In Terrawatt's professional experience, a large number of such sites have not been appropriately sealed and reclaimed and would require substantial capital investment (and a years-long process) before any solar panels could be put down. That renders the edilizia libera permitting simplification of little relevance in the grand scheme of the energy transition due to its low potential impact. Similar simplifications, allowing the use of slightly more streamlined procedures, have been applied to other categories of land.
In practice, though, no simplification of permitting has been applied to utility scale solar built on agricultural land, unlike agrivoltaic installations, which have received slimmer authorization procedures. It is important to note that, if Italy’s 2030 target of 130 GW of installed renewable energy capacity were to be achieved exclusively with solar power, around 200,000 hectares of land would be required. Italy’s total agricultural land surface is around 12.8 million hectares. For this reason, the most significant potential for solar installation in Italy lies in repurposing agricultural land, which could be achieved by installing traditional utility scale solar until the target is met without making a material dent in the land available for agriculture.
What is conspicuously missing from Italy's energy transition strategy, to achieve the 2030 target, is a cohesive set of clear national regulations intricately aligned with European decarbonization objectives. Such regulations should effectively govern the renewables permitting process, offering transparent criteria and defined timelines. The provision of such regulatory clarity is pivotal for instilling much-needed certainty within the energy market as it strives to reach a crucial milestone in Italy's energy transition journey.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/02/south-africa-conducts-tender-to-reshape-renewables-tender-program/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,SOUTH AFRICA",ANGELA SKUJINS,"NOVEMBER 2, 2023",South Africa conducts tender to reshape renewables tender program,"The South African government-owned Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) is inviting transaction advisors to apply to review the “cost effectiveness and efficacy” of the country’s decade-old Renewable Energy IPP Procurement (REIPPP) program, which handles large-scale renewable energy projects. The tender is also calling for consultants to recommend a new model.
The deadline for applications is 2 Nov. 2023.
According to the tender document, the current auction model is “expensive” for applicants and is placing a “financial burden” on the office evaluating the proposals.
The work for the successful applicant would comprise a report on the current REIPPP model and an implementation plan for a possible replacement.
The report should identify “bottlenecks” in the current program’s evaluation processes while conducting a start-to-finish review of operations. A comprehensive study on the recommended best alternative auction model is required, as well as an implementation and rollout plan spanning supporting business procedures, infrastructure, resource requirements and cost analysis.
According to Chris Ahlfeldt, an energy specialist at Blue Horizon Energy Consulting Services, the REIPPP model has received international recognition for successfully structuring a public private partnership with government and independent power producers (IPPs) that achieves both environmental and social benefits for the country.
“The REIPPP has been transparent with its procurement requirements which enabled a high degree of competition between international IPPs to source less expensive and clean electricity for South Africa,” he told pv magazine. “The program has experienced too many delays since it began in 2011 for various reasons such as Eskom opposition to government inefficiencies which has slowed the process and contributed to the current shortage of power in the country.”
According to Ahlfeldt, these delays have also limited industrialization in the country as many manufacturing facilities opened and then had to close due to lack of demand. “REIPPP also hasn’t been well integrated with Transmission Planning in the country as seen from the last procurement round when no wind projects were procured due to lack of available transmission capacity,” he added. “The lack of available transmission capacity in parts of the country with the highest resource is the biggest challenge for utility-scale solar PV currently in addition to an enabling electricity market structure with an independent transmission operator.”
Since the REIPPP program was launched in 2011, 6,422 MW of energy has been procured from 122 independent power producers in seven bid rounds, according to DBSA. Roughly 99% of projects have reached financial close.
The tender document forecasts that from 2019 to 2030, 37,696 MW of new energy projects will be added to the grid under REIPPP, with 20,400 MW comprising wind and solar.
The issues impacting the current REIPPP program involve assessing the scale of applications and the cost of applying.
The department tasked with assessing applications, the self-funded Independent Power Producer Office, is financially burdened as “the cost of the evaluation is not proportional to the amount of megawatt procured,” the tender document states.
Due to the “extensive nature of the qualification and evaluation criteria,” the cost of participation for applicants in REIPPP has also been described as “expensive”.
“A streamlined auction process could reduce the cost of the bidding process for the IPP Office, but also reduce development costs for bidders that will be reflected in more affordable tariffs for the consumer,” the document states.
A litany of issues – such as extensive load-shedding, lack of grid capacity, failing coal-fired power stations and little progress in clean power procurement – plague South Africa’s energy sector. Despite these hurdles, however, the country recorded 5,826 MW of PV installed capacity at the end of 2022, according to the most recent data published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
Meanwhile, the South African energy regulator NERSA authorized the National Transmission Company of South Africa to operate a transmission system independently from troubled state-owned utility Eskom, within national boundaries. The move is part of the government's plan to split Eskom into three separate entities: Generation, Transmission, and Distribution.
Currently, Eskom remains the sole buyer of power generated under the REIPPP program.
South Africa's National Treasury is currently seeking to craft a bill to address Eskom's unsustainable ZAR 423 billion ($22.9 billion) debt with a ZAR 254 billion debt relief arrangement. The bill proposes advances of ZAR 78 billion in 2023-24, ZAR 66 billion in 2024/25, and ZAR 40 billion in 2025-26, specifically designated to cover capital and interest payments.

Source Energia, an energy developer, and Mozambique’s national utility, Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM), are also partners in what is touted to be the country’s first utility-scale solar and energy storage plant.
According to the press release, there is a 25-year power purchase agreement for the plant in Cuamba, a district in northern Mozambique, to supply energy to EDM. The existing Cuamba substation was also recently upgraded to allow the “smooth integration” of solar energy onto the grid, according to the statement.
The Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund – an organization that encourages private infrastructure investment in developing countries – provided roughly $19 million in debt funding to get the $36 million project off the ground. BII Plus, the technical assistance facility of British International Investment, also awarded a $1 million grant, and the Private Infrastructure Development Group provided a $7 million grant to support affordable tariffs, fund grid upgrades, and implement an energy storage system for EDM.
A Globeleq spokesperson told pv magazine that the plant, which commenced development in 2017, was not part of a tender but was “awarded directly” by the country’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. The spokesperson did not disclose the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). “But [we] can say it is in line with regional benchmarks,” the person said.
Filipe Nyusi, the president of Mozambique, said in the press release that the project marks a turning point for the Cuamba district, as it will provide greater energy security and stability.
“This is the third large-scale solar plant in Mozambique and the second that has had the support of the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Norway, two long-time friend and partner countries,” he said. “We expect to build more renewable projects like this and look forward to initiating the Namaacha project – the first wind project in our country.”
Mozambique recorded 108 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2022, according to the most recent figures published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The African country is claimed to have untapped “power generation potential,” with access to underused coal, hydro, gas, wind and solar energy resources.
Despite this, it was reported in 2017 that only one-quarter of the country's population had access to electricity. Aging transmission and distribution networks and unfavorable market conditions act as barriers to the country reaching its renewable energy generation potential.

Global investments in the solar energy sector touched the $308 billion mark in 2022, registering a massive increase of 36% over 2021 levels. Still, solar accounted for only 11.5% of the overall energy investment in 2022 ($2.6 trillion), according to a new report by the International Solar Alliance, released at its recent sixth assembly in New Delhi
The report stated that solar investments are overwhelmingly concentrated in a few developed countries in the Asia Pacific Region, followed by Europe and North America. In 2022, Asia Pacific and Europe and North America accounted for 55% and 33% of global solar project development investment, respectively. Within these regions, investments have been dominated by economies that have a mature PV market, such as China, the United States, Japan, Spain, Australia, the Netherlands, South Korea, Brazil, Vietnam, Germany, and India. 
China and the United States have consistently attracted the most annual solar investments, with their combined share of about 50% of all solar investments since 2015. Only a small fraction of global investments in the solar sector is being made in emerging and developing economies such as the Middle East and Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Thus, these regions are lagging behind in the race of solar energy deployment.
The report states that to accelerate global investments in solar energy, it is vital to prioritize these developing and underdeveloped regions across the world that have a huge unrealized solar potential.
Solar project development accounted for nearly 90% of the total investments made across the solar value chain in 2022. Segment wise, utility-scale solar segment accounted for the highest investments in solar project deployment with a share of 43% followed by residential solar segment at 39% and commercial & industrial (C&I) solar segment at 18% in 2022.
Private finance was a major contributor to solar energy projects, accounting for more than 80% of total investments between 2015 and 2022. The public sector contributed to the remaining investments during the same period. 
The report states that for ensuring just energy transition and inclusion, more finance needs to be mobilized from public players as most of the private financing is directed towards advanced economies.

It said exports in the second quarter amounted to 92.5%, with China and India providing 88% of the total export demand.
Exports beyond Europe were also strong in the first quarter compared to domestic demand. In July the VDMA reported that 89% of PV equipment sales were for foreign markets, with Asia noted as the largest market.
Looking ahead, the VDMA expects that industrial policy will be instrumental to driving investment in large projects, targeting multiple gigawatts of capacity.
“In the second quarter of this year, solar PV equipment manufacturers recorded a significant increase in turnover. Through targeted industry policy measures, regional ecosystems for manufacturing can be created where solar photovoltaic products will be produced in large GW-scale factories. Manufacturers of machinery and equipment with the label ‘Made in Germany' and ‘Made in Europe' are ready to support future projects worldwide,” said Peter Fath, Managing Director of RCT Solutions and Chairman of the Board of VDMA Photovoltaic Equipment.
Sales up, incoming orders down
European mechanical engineering companies, including those in Germany, reported a sales increase of 50% in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. This was also 7% higher compared to the same period last year.
Approximately 88% of total sales in the second quarter were generated by the Asian market, which includes both China and India, according to the VDMA. The U.S. market had a 4% share of sales this past quarter, while the European market, including Germany, held a 7.5% share.
“The Asian market retains its leading position as the main market for products from German PV equipment companies. Thanks to the programs for local production in India and the USA, the market in these countries is stable and will become expected to grow steadily in the coming quarters,” stated Jutta Trube, Division Manager, VDMA Photovoltaic Equipment.
Indeed, most of the incoming orders in the second quarter, were from the Asian market (82%), whereas the German and European regions combined represented 10.6% of incoming orders and the U.S. represented 7.3% of orders.
The positive sales news is somewhat tempered by incoming order figures, which were reportedly down by 14% compared to the first quarter.
The thin film sector accounts for about a third of the equipment suppliers’ total turnover, with crystalline cell manufacturing equipment representing the majority share. As for types of equipment in demand, it is components that dominate the sales channel, rather than complete equipment systems.
Furthermore, sales of equipment for the production of ingots and wafers remained at a “very low” level for several quarters, according to the VDMA.

Dubbed Green Energy Solutions, the software was developed using C sharp language, with 2023 prices in US dollars for the different system components.
“The new software includes new features not available in other photovoltaic software available in the market, such as the reliability of the system and producing the options to the user to choose the optimum solution according to the reliability, initial cost, and total cost for the lifetime of the project,” the researchers explained.
The software assumes PV modules to have a lifetime of 24 years, with the inverters and the batteries being replaced every 5 and 3 years, respectively.
In its user interface, the program asks the user for a few parameters. First, it asks for the system location to determine the solar radiation throughout the year. The user then needs to decide whether the system is independent or connected to the grid and whether the modules are fixed or use single or double-axis tracking.
The user is also required to choose the load and its profile from three load profiles. “Constant Load means the load is constant 24 hours, 365 days per year,” the scientists explained. “Daily Load means the load is operated from sunrise to sunset every day, 365 days per year; while Night load means that the load is operated from sunset to sunrise every day, 365 days per year.”
Based on those inputs, the system produces several outputs, such as the required size of the PV array, the battery size needed in case of a stand-alone system, and the project's required surface. It also calculates the cost/kWh generated from the system in US dollars, including loan costs.
“The reliability cost results enable the user to choose the suitable solution for the PV system according to his budget,” the researchers added. “The program illustrates that a slight decrease in reliability will result in a significant system cost reduction. For example, if the reliability is increased from 97.83% to 99.52%, the cost is increased by 88.5%.”
Finally, the research group has compared the monthly kWh/m2 calculated by its program with that calculated by PVsyst, which is a globally popular software package to study, size, simulate, and analyze data from PV systems.
According to their results, Green Energy Solutions' simulation error margin compared to PVsyst ranged from 1.46% in May to 9.06% in January. In yearly calculation, the novel program was off by 0.44%.
The software was introduced in the article “Developing Techno-economic GUI-based Software for On-grid and Off-grid Photovoltaic Systems Sizing,” published in Ain Shams Engineering Journal. The research group includes scientists from the Ain Shams University, the Misr International Technological University, and the Sadat Academy for Management Sciences.

With a huge volume of tax credits available to clean technology manufacturers under the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the United States is beginning to see an influx of solar module makers setting up shop. While the clock is ticking on the opportunity to take advantage of the tax credits, establishing a vertically integrated facility quickly is no small task.
At the recent RoundtablesUS 23, Jonathan Gifford, editor-in-chief of pv magazine, moderated a panel session that discussed what technologies are best suited to both the rapid rollout and also long-term competitiveness.
The panelists included Exawatt PV Head Alex Barrows, PVEL VP of Sales Tristan Erion-Lorico, DNV Senior Engineer MinWah Leung, and Estuary Power Vice President Kim Primerano.
In the panel on how the IRA is changing the landscape of solar manufacturing in the United States, four experts discussed how realistic it is to reduce our dependence on Chinese imports, what the challenges are for manufacturers in setting up shop in the United States, and how we fill in anticipated gaps in the US supply chain.
Barrows kicked off the next panel session by noting that while a lot of module manufacturing announcements have come out, not all will get built. But he estimates that if every company does what they say they intend to do, we could have 90 GW of module capacity by 2026, 20 GW of cells and potentially 20 GW of wafer.
Clearly the mismatch in capacity leaves US manufacturers beholden to importing cells and wafers, which presents a myriad of challenges, not the least of which is for developers to claim the domestic content adder. Erion-Lorico pointed out that there’s a lot to be done, but that there are challenges remain, ranging from the current transformer shortage to the challenge of hiring skilled workers. Erion-Lorico sees the workforce issue as a huge challenge. He estimates that we’ll need 4,000 to 5,000 people to run 100 GW of plants.
With most announced manufacturing facilities set to produce solar modules, the question is which module technology will be manufactured. DNV's Leung said that they see TOPCon as the big player. She thinks that heterojunction (HJT) will play a role in the future, but that TOPCon will be “the main technology, at least in the next few years.”
Leung said there are two pieces that DNV looks for in assessing module quality and risk. One is the design of the module –and what the technology risk is in terms of the design of the module. The second piece is the risk in terms of production quality on the manufacturing side. As DNV specializes in assessing risk, she said that it comes down to extended duration testing, which speaks to the design of the module. To assess manufacturing quality DNV also looks at factory audits, production quality, reports, monitoring, and pre inspection reports.
The November issue of pv magazine, due out next week, is dominated by the issue of global oversupply and examines the effects of a solar glut in the European Union, the United States, and other markets. We turn the spotlight on PV developments in South Korea, Taiwan, and Africa and update readers on technological progress in thin films, kerfless wafering, and mass produced heterojunction PV.
Primerano of Estuary Power said that she is risk averse and doesn’t “usually like to be the first one off the production line.” While Estuary Power is closely monitoring the buildout of U.S. solar manufacturing, the company is not currently modeling domestic content. She noted that if the numbers that Barrows was projecting come true, it’ll result in the prices coming down while driving capacity up. At that point, she said, Estuary Power would start to look at domestically manufactured modules.
In terms of technology choice, however, Primerano said Estuary Power is definitely looking at TOPCon and planning to use it in an upcoming project. Erion-Lorico spoke of what PVEL is finding in its testing. He said both HJT and TOPCon introduce new risks and there’s a range of results, but over time the modules have industry leading low degradation rates. Developing TOPCon is a sensitive process, and the production window is tighter, he said. But they are seeing great results from factories overseas in PID for TOPCon and they’re seeing great results in thermal cycling in HJT. However, he noted that it’s “a wider range that’s going to take time to tighten.”
Another thing we’re starting to see is US-made encapsulants and backsheets, according to Erion-Lorico, which is a result of the push to onshore the whole solar supply chain. He pointed out that this brings risk as well because manufacturers like Trina have long relationships with materials suppliers, they know how the materials will perform. And yet, to get to that 40% domestic content, some manufacturers will be looking to source materials from new US manufacturing lines.

Trusted Australian experts in solar panel performance, Lawrence McIntosh and Michelle McCann at Canberra-based PV Lab, have combined forces with innovators in high-speed electroluminescence imaging at Quantified Energy Labs (QE-Labs) in Singapore, to bring efficient solar panel testing to the Australian utility market at scale.
The technology is vital for testing performance at various points in the solar asset lifecycle. It serves as a useful baseline during solar farm commissioning, identifies underperformance before the end of panel defect liability periods, verifies damages caused by severe weather events for insurers, and checks performance during changes in farm ownership. And of course it pinpoints problems, assists in targeting maintenance, and reduces risks such as fire due to faulty panels, throughout the life of the asset.
QE-Labs is a commercial spin-out of technology developed at the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), part of the National University of Singapore.
“Our team spent a decade researching PV panel technologies, doing indoor testing, and certifying performance and reliability of panels in our tropical Singapore environment,” QE-Labs CEO Yan Wang told pv magazine Australia at All-Energy in Melbourne last week. “Then developers who were experiencing yield losses started sending us modules from their solar farms for testing.”
It wasn’t long, says Wang, before all parties realized that this method of bringing panels to the lab was too laborious and time-consuming, which also made it expensive – “the unit price was too high.” And as McCann said, the sampling method of nailing underperforming culprits across an entire solar farm was like “looking for a needle in a haystack.”
Researchers at SERIS realized that electroluminescence (EL) imaging – their preferred inspection technology, which “produces something like an x-ray of the solar panel,” according to Wang – could be taken into the field. But how much better would it be, if imaging didn’t have to be set up for each panel?
McIntosh and McCann, working in their Australian lab to assess the performance of panels in the Australian utility solar sector, had come to a similar conclusion.
“We knew that drones would revolutionise the way we gather data, and if they could be used to take electroluminescence images, we’d be able to bring huge scale to helping asset owners assess the condition of their solar farms,” McIntosh told pv magazine Australia.
He and McCann had just decided that developing their own autonomous EL system would not be “commercially smart”, when they were introduced by solar colleagues in Germany to QE-Labs. “It’s a really good fit,” says McCann of the resulting collaboration. “They’ve got the drones and the tech, and we’ve got the site experience and the ability to fly and work in Australia.”
McIntosh became a licensed commercial drone pilot and began PV Lab’s fly-by-night operation. That is to say, another benefit of electroluminescence imaging is that it is carried out in the dark, out of solar-generation hours.

First Solar has announced its third-quarter earnings for 2023, posting a miss on revenues but beating expectations on earnings per share.
The manufacturer of cadmium telluride thin-film solar modules recorded $801 million of revenue, falling short of expectations of $892 million. It reported an earnings per share of $2.50, exceeding expectations by 22.5%. In the same quarter last year, First Solar delivered a loss per share of $0.46 and $629 million in sales, showing a strong move toward profitability and sustained revenue growth.
The company shipped 2.7 GW of solar module orders in the third quarter. Its backlog of orders has reached 82 GW, and year-to-date orders have reached 28 GW.
First Solar delivered gross margins that were significantly higher than Wall Street expectations. Gross margins came in at 47%, higher than the consensus of 39%. Gross margins improved based on lower sales freight costs, higher module average sales prices, and a higher volume of US-produced modules, which make them eligible for the 45x tax credit under the US Inflation Reduction Act.
“We believe the future belongs to thin film,” said CEO Mark Widmar on the company’s earnings call.
First Solar continues to open more manufacturing capacity in the United States and abroad to meet the growing backlog of orders booked through the near- and mid-term. It produced 2.5 GW of Series 6 modules in the third quarter. Its third Ohio factory is operating a Series 7 manufacturing line, producing 15,000 modules per day. Cumulatively, the company’s Series 7 module production in the U.S. has surpassed 1 GW.
First Solar is targeting 25 GW of global manufacturing capacity by 2026. It has also begun producing bifacial thin-film modules, which it said is a first for the industry.
“The technology features an innovative, transparent back contact pioneered by First Solar’s research and development team, which, in addition to enabling bifacial energy gain, allows infrared wavelengths of light pass through rather than be absorbed as heat and is expected to lower the operational temperature of the bifacial module and result in higher specific energy yield,” said Widmar.
The company secured an average per watt sales price of $0.296 in the third quarter.
“We expect to qualify for an IRA credit of approximately $0.17 per watt for each module produced in the U.S. and sold to a third party, which is recognized as a reduction to cost of sales in the period of sale,” said Alexander Bradley, chief financial officer of First Solar. “During the third quarter, we recognized $205 million of such credits compared to $155 million in the second quarter.”
