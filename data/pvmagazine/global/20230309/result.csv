“Compared to the regular 3D perovskite solar cells, these cells are more stable,” researcher Yiqiang Zhang told pv magazine. “They are suitable for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), conventional solar, and wearable devices, featuring long device stability.”
Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites have often improved stability against humidity and lower encapsulation costs. One of their first applications will likely be as top-layer for conventional perovskite solar cells.
The researchers used a LDRP based on γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as the organic spacer cation and a type of lead-halide perovskite known as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3).
“The GABA-MAPbI3 film delivers an improved carrier mobility of 1.61 cm2 Vand charge (electron and hole) diffusion length over 700 nm,” they stated.
The cell configuration comprises an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer, the 2D perovskite absorber, a spiro-OMeTAD hole-blocking layer, and a metal contact. The Chinese team said the use of the LDPR results in a cell's power conversion efficiency of 18.73%, which compares to 16.14% in a reference device without the addition of GABA.
“In addition, the start-of-art devices exhibit outstanding stability under continuous illumination, ambient atmosphere, 65 C, and 85% relative humidity, respectively. We speculate that the electrons of GABA can push the excitonic states outward from the band tails via hydrogen-bonding interaction.”
The scientists claim that hydrogen-bonding interactions between the carboxyl groups of the bilayer GABA spacer cations bridge the charge transfer channel, while also promoting the optimization of the energy band structure responsible for the light absorption.
They described the cell tech in “Dredging the Charge-Carrier Transfer Pathway for Efficient Low-Dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper Perovskite Solar Cells,” which was recently published in Angewandte Chemie.
“The potential production costs are comparable to the regular 3D perovskite solar cells, which is lower than the commercialized silicon cells,” Zhang concluded.

It said it will initially invest €25 million ($26.4 million) in the new factory. It has already secured 24,000 square meters of land for the factory.
The company said the new facility will produce high-efficiency solar panels, without providing further technical details. It currently manufactures n-type interdigitated back-contacted (IBC) modules, as well as PERC panels and heterojunction (HJT) products.
“The project fits into the company's strategic industrial plan, and it follows through on the European mission of rebuilding the European supply chain, with FuturaSun taking the role of one of the main players,” said FuturaSun CEO Alessandro Barin.
The company is based in Cittadella, in Italy's Padua province, and operates two solar modules factories totaling 1 GW in China. Its Italian staff focus on R&D in areas such as interdigitated back-contact (IBC) cells, cylindrical ribbons, glass-glass solutions and modules with independent sections.
The new factory, when constructed, will become the second gigawatt-scale PV module manufacturing facility in Italy. A 3 GW facility is currently being constructed by the Italian utility Enel in Sicily, southern Italy. This facility is expected to begin commercial operations this year. The company is betting on n-type HTJ cells with an efficiency of 25.5%. It said this could result in module efficiencies above 24%

The good news is that winter is behind us in Europe and there have been no blackouts or emergency rationing of natural gas and other fuels. The bad news is that Europe has a multitude of challenges going forward, starting with more expensive energy, poor positioning in key energy technologies, and the growing threat to European industry from the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
Together, these factors threaten to undermine Europe’s competitiveness and living standards. To combat these risks, Europe needs to respond rapidly with a long-term, joined-up strategy.
Back in August of 2022, as prices for electricity, coal, diesel, and natural gas hit all-time highs, it was not clear whether Europe would be able to get through the winter without significant damage to its economy. Energy users reacted to high prices by reducing demand and by moving away from natural gas to alternatives such as coal, wood, and oil; averting part of the economic impact.
The weather gods were also kind. Europe had a warm winter, including record temperatures in December and January across many regions. France also did a stellar job, considering that in August more than half of its nuclear reactors were down for repairs and not expected to be back online in time for the winter months. That would have caused a significant risk of blackouts. Instead, by the start of January, almost three-quarters of the French nuclear fleet was up and running.
Natural gas storage levels across Europe are very high now thanks to lower demand for the fuel and the aggressive purchase of liquefied natural gas (LNG) under order from the European Commission. Add the fact that Germany and Finland have now opened a handful of floating storage and regasification units and – in the worst-case scenario – Europe can do without any Russian gas, going forward.
Despite these successes, the continent is still facing high gas prices in future as well as increased volatility of power prices and risks. Replacing low-cost Russian pipeline gas with more expensive LNG means that European consumers are going to face higher prices in the months ahead. The silver lining is that customers will be forced to become more efficient and move to cleaner alternatives such as heat pumps.
Facing gas prices that will remain substantially higher than they have been in the past will cause competitive problems for European heavy industry, however. To add to these worries, US President Joe Biden’s IRA incentives will reduce the cost of power for US electricity buyers, which will increase the nation’s energy-cost advantage. The IRA also incentivizes local production of key decarbonization technology, such as batteries and solar panels, and it will help the United States reindustrialize around these key future-growth technologies.

Meanwhile, back in Europe, there is not one manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries or solar panels in the top 10 worldwide, and the traditionally European-led wind industry is in tatters, with massive, billion-euro losses at industry leaders Vestas and Siemens-Gamesa. This begs the question: What should be done about the situation?
What not to do is very clear. Most crucially, procrastination and endless discussion must be avoided because every day of delayed decisions lessens Europe’s ability to regain competitive advantage or even parity. The second scenario that should be avoided is European countries trying to go it alone as the scale of the challenge can only be met with joint and unified European efforts. The European Union thus needs to be willing to collectively invest in its own future by funding R&D and new infrastructure and by taking more risks.
Companies such as the Swedish electric vehicle battery champion Northvolt provide an example of success where European private and public efforts are combined to quickly scale up new production facilities. To compete with China, which has shown itself much better at scaling up production facilities than Europe, there needs to be a concerted effort led by governments of EU member states such as Germany and Italy, as well as by the European Commission, to incentivize and ensure swifter policy alignment across all member countries. Coordination and reaching consensus at a quick pace have always been a sore point for the EU. It is the toughest goal to achieve, as it requires compromises from large and small nations, both wealthy and less affluent.
To be successful, European countries need to commit to the energy transition and to an open dialogue with all citizens. Member states must also take a more active role in international affairs, particularly around key raw materials and energy fuels. The big question is whether Europe can do it. The answer is yes and by doing so, Europe will not only break its addiction to fossil fuels but also help create jobs and economic progress in future-oriented clean industries.

“A solar PV installation complements a household’s heat pumps and fulfills a significant extent of its electricity needs. The savings for the two technologies together are then higher than for each individual technology,” the report says.
The industry body modeled three scenarios for medium-sized households in Germany, Spain, and Italy during the energy crisis in 2022. A “PV-only” scenario, a “heat pump-only” scenario, and a “PV plus heat pump” combo scenario, which also includes a buffer – a warm water storage tank. The savings are compared to the price that the average family household would pay by sourcing all its electricity from the grid and using a gas boiler for heating.
The PV system was assumed to have capacities of 8 kW in Germany and 7 kW in Spain and Italy. An air-source heat pump with 7 kW, 3 kW, and 4 kW output was modeled for the three countries, respectively. In Germany, the capacity of the storage tank was set to 800 liters, and to 400 liters in both Spain and Italy.
The thermal demand for space and water heating was modeled at 12,000 kWh to 20,000 kWh, for existing building stocks and using a gas boiler with 85% efficiency. The annual electricity demand for an average family home was assumed at 4,000 KWh to 4,500 kWh, and the gas and electricity prices for 2022 were set according to the Household Energy Price Index.
“All relevant support measures applying to average family homes are included,” SolarPower Europe said, noting that this includes VAT cuts on gas in all three countries. For PV electricity generation, savings from feeding electricity back to the grid are also included.
The results show that Italian households saved the most by using a PV-heat pump combo at €3,766 ($3,984), reportedly due to high electricity prices in Italy. Germany followed with savings of €3,614, and Spain at €2,831.
“Reduced savings in Spain reflect the measures taken by the Iberian market to lower wholesale electricity prices,” said SolarPower Europe.
The combination of both technologies reduced the energy bill by 62% in Germany, 83% in Italy, and 84% in Spain, in comparison with the scenario where households sourced all electricity from the grid and used gas for heating.
In the “heat pump-only” scenario, savings for Germany stood at €1,884, €958 for Spain, and €506 for Italy. In the “PV-only scenario”, Italy had savings of €2,935, Spain of €1,352, and Germany of €1,263.
The study also shows that solar PV and heat pumps work effectively together throughout the year if the buffer storage tank is also installed. In Germany, solar power can cover 36% of total heat pump electricity demand in a cold year with low PV output, according to SPE. Spain and Italy, showered with sun, present the best results. Even in a cold year with low PV input, solar covers 59% of the heat pump demand in Spain, and 50% in Italy.
SPE concludes the report with five policy recommendations for lowering the payback period of the PV-heat pump combo from purportedly around 20 years at present to a much more attractive 10 years. These include increasing Capex support for combined investments, offering loans at a low-interest rate, and promoting collective self-consumption.
“The best time to install solar PV + heat pumps was yesterday,” said Dries Acke, policy director of SolarPower Europe. “The next best time is now. European policymakers need to bring the benefits of gas-free homes to the wider population.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/09/semi-transparent-organic-photovoltaics-for-greenhouse-applications/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 9, 2023",Semi-transparent organic photovoltaics for greenhouse applications,"UCLA researchers have developed organic solar (OPV) cells that can provide energy to greenhouses while also blocking ultraviolet rays to prevent overheating.
“We already established a startup that will scale up production of these organic solar cells for industrial use,” researcher Minhuan Wang told pv magazine.
The new device features the L-glutathione antioxidant as a reductive interlayer. This facilitates charge transfer between the cell's zinc oxide (ZnO) layer and the photoactive layer made, which is made of a non-fullerene acceptor known as PM6:Y6, the scientists said in “Achieving sustainability of greenhouses by integrating stable semi-transparent organic photovoltaics,” which was recently published in Nature Sustainability.
They built the cell with a substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), the novel interlayer, the photoactive layer, a hole transport layer made of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3), and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
“The l-G molecule can effectively nullify both major defects in the ZnO film and reduce the carrier recombination at the interface,” the academics said, in reference to the passivation effect of the interlayer. “The charge transfer from the ZnO surface to the O 2 is impeded by the l-G molecule, preventing the formation of the superoxide molecule.”
According to their findings, the new interlayer has two different functions. On one side, it acts as a passivation agent and, on the other side, it suppresses superoxide formation, which is usually triggered by the oxygen vacancy on the ZnO surface.
“The suppressed superoxide and hydroxide radical generation notably led to enhanced operational stability of the encapsulated semi-transparent OPV devices with the PM6/Y6 photoactive layer,” the US group said. “The devices with the l-G interlayer retained over 84% of their initial efficiency after 1,008 h continuous exposure under illumination.”
With the addition of the interlayer, the cell efficiency also increased – from 11.6% to 13.5% – with an enhancement of the short-circuit current density from 20.5 to 22.2 mA cm−2. “Additionally, due to the strong reducibility of the l-G molecule, the production of the radicals is reduced,” the scientists said.
They also tested the growth of common crops such as wheat, mung beans, and broccoli in a setup with a transparent glass roof with segments of inorganic solar cells and a setup with a roof made entirely from semi-transparent organic solar cells.
“The crops in the greenhouse with the organic solar roof grew more than the crops in a regular greenhouse,” they stated, noting that the L-glutathione layer blocked ultraviolet rays, which are detrimental to plant growth, as well as infrared rays, which can cause greenhouses to overheat.
“We didn’t expect the organic solar cells to outperform a conventional glass-roof greenhouse,” said co-author Yepin Zhao. “But we repeated the experiments multiple times with the same results and after further research and analysis, we discovered that plants don’t need as much sunlight to grow as we’d originally thought.”

India Ratings and Research has maintained a “stable” outlook for the Indian solar sector in fiscal 2023-24, while maintaining a “negative” outlook on wind power projects. It has revised the rating outlook for thermal assets to “positive” from “stable.”
India added 14 GW of solar and 1.8 GW of wind power generation capacity in 2022, according to analysts. However, wind projects continue to be plagued by generation variability.
“Elimination of reverse auction is likely to allow developers bid with a better risk-return profile and improve the capacity addition in the medium term,” said the analysts.
India Ratings and Research revised its outlook for thermal power projects to “positive,” based on an improvement in electricity demand that could increase plant load factor to above 65%, better visibility of coal-cost pass-through, and adequate liquidity.

“Polysilicon prices began to plummet in December last year, so the major polysilicon suppliers started to limit market supply,” the analysts said, noting that the price decrease was related to a strong increase in polysilicon capacity across the Chinese industry. “Subsequently, polysilicon prices in China started to rally before the Lunar New Year holiday this January, rising rapidly to the current range of CNY 220 ($31.55) to CNY 240 per kg.”
They said they believe that the average price of polysilicon will fall by 3.2% from CNY 222/kg in February to CNY 215/kg in March. Wafer prices, meanwhile, will likely drop by 4.3%, from CNY 6.22 per piece to CNY 5.95 for M10 products and from CNY 8.2 to CNY 8 for G12 products.
Average prices for solar cells should decline 3.6% from CNY 1.12 per watt to CNY 1.08 for both M10 and G12 products. The price of M10 and G12 monocrystalline panels, meanwhile, should fall from CNY 1.77 per W in February to CNY 1.74 in March.
“Wafer suppliers significantly raised their capacity utilization rates because polysilicon supply was expanding again. Therefore, wafer prices will not be able to maintain their upward momentum as supply becomes more plentiful,” TrendForce said. “The temporary tightening of wafer supply also put pressure on cell supply. Nevertheless, there was already widespread anticipation for this round of hikes, so cell buyers mostly accepted higher prices.”
The analysts said module prices will align with the usual range following a drop in prices of materials and components.
“Falling module prices will effectively spur installation demand, and the peak season for installations is expected to arrive earlier compared with the preceding years,” they explained, warning that the Chinese PV industry could face sharp price fluctuations over the short term. “Therefore, module suppliers are mostly optimistic about the market situation from this March onward.”
“In sum, there is still a considerable degree of uncertainty in the development of the global PV market this year,” they concluded.

“The path toward zero net energy translates into great opportunities for the expansion of the union's net zero industry, which includes in particular solar energy, onshore and marine wind, heat pumps, electrolyzers, batteries and their supply chains,” said the document, which pv magazine has seen.
For the solar technologies, the EU said it will continue to depend on imports from China, which exceed 90% of products in certain earlier segments of the value chain, including ingots and wafers.
The draft document proposes that, by 2030, the solar module production capacity of the European Union will be sufficient to cater to at least 40% of the annual expected demand under the REPowerEU and Green Pact initiatives, which involve the planned installation of 600 GW of solar capacity.
It also requires that 85% of wind energy components of the EU are manufactured in Europe. The percentage for heat pumps is 60%, 85% for batteries, and 50% for electrolyzers.
The European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC) believes that at least 75% of solar demand in Europe should be covered by local production, which implies manufacturing 35 GW in Europe by 2025, 60 GW by 2026, and 100 GW in 2030.

French solar developer Technique Solaire has signed a partnership with the National Institute of Agronomic Research INRAE of Nouzilly (Poultry Experimental Unit) and Magneraud (Experimental Unit of Alternative Poultry Farming Systems) to determine the impact of photovoltaic panels on outdoor areas for poultry.
Since 2017, the company has been developing photovoltaic aviaries with game and poultry breeders. These consist of a succession of PV shelters, linked together by nets.
In addition to lower installation costs, the aviaries offer the advantage of integrating outdoor chicken coops in the management of poultry farming of species such as broilers and ducks. Technique Solaire said the use of outdoor coops for birds is not common, with many birds never leaving the breeding buildings. It said that several studies have demonstrated that birds prefer shady outdoor runs, with trees, fences or panels, however.
With INRAE, Technique Solaire is seeking to analyze and characterize the evolution of animal behavior in the presence of these routes. According to the developer, the first observations made under an operating aviary in Lot-et-Garonne are encouraging, with more frequent, longer and more distant outings from the breeding building.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/09/solar-for-cobalt-sulfate-production/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 9, 2023",Solar for cobalt sulfate production,"From pv magazine USA
EVelution Energy, an electric vehicle battery materials company, has secured the approval of the Yuma County Board of Supervisors to develop a solar-powered cobalt sulfate production facility in Yuma County, Arizona. It will be the first EV battery facility with on-site renewable energy generation in the United States.
The facility expects to produce  7,000 tons of cobalt per year and calls for 28.4 MW of on-site solar power generating arrays to be installed on 105 acres of the company’s 139-acre property in Yuma. The estimated power needs of the cobalt processing facility are expected to be about 6 MW, allowing the company to sell excess power during the day to local electric utility, the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation District, Gil Michel-Garcia, executive vice president and general counsel of EVelution, told pv magazine USA.
EVelution expects to start construction of the processing facility in 2024. It expects it to be fully operational by 2026, when it will have 360 full-time employees, the company said.
Currently, the primary source of power for the district is hydropower from the Parker Dam, whose water level has been decreasing due to drought conditions, Michel-Garcia said. As a result, the district has expressed an interest in purchasing 6 MW of excess power production, with the possibility of acquiring more in the future, Michel-Garcia said.
“We expect that the surrounding agricultural community will benefit will from having access to our locally generated low cost clean power,” he said, adding that EVelution’s facility is expected to cost about $200 million to build.
The EV battery materials facility uses an atmospheric leaching process, a process which requires a significant amount of peak energy to heat water. In typical leaching facilities, the heating is typically done using natural gas or propone heaters, while EVelution intends to use solar power to heat the water and to store it in large hot water storage tanks, Michel-Garcia explained. The tanks will store heated water to operate its processing facility overnight and thus reduce the overnight power requirement load on the district utility as well, he said.
With excess generating capacity, Michel-Garcia said EVelution plans to install battery storage capacity of about 24 MW (96 MWh) to manage peak power sold to Wellton-Mohawk during the day and to store excess solar to further reduce its overnight power requirements.
To interconnect the cobalt processing facility to the  grid, EVelution will pay the district to build a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line to interconnect to a local power substation, which will require an interconnection agreement with the district for the purchase and sale of power, Michel-Garcia said.
The company is currently in discussions to reach an offtake agreement for the pricing of excess solar power and the pricing for the supply of electric power during the evening periods, as well as the construction of the 34.5 kV electric transmission line from to interconnect with its processing facility, he said.
As a US company, Michel-Garcia said EVelution will be the first company to build a carbon neutral cobalt sulfate production facility in the United States with on-site generation.  The company’s aim is to combat climate change, boost US manufacturing, and reduce our economic reliance on other countries for EV battery materials.
Currently about 70% of the world’s EV battery-grade cobalt sulfate comes from China, with Finland and Indonesia producing most of the remainder.  EVelution Energy is hoping to contribute to supplying 40% of the EV battery-grade cobalt sulfate required by US-made EVs by 2027, said Michel-Garcia.
“What is interesting about this project are the confluence of the various tax incentives that have recently become available in the U.S. in order to make green infrastructure projects like this possible,” he said.
EVelution Energy stands to recover costs from the solar investment tax credit for its on-site solar facility, as well as the Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act.  This Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (PTC) applies tax credits of up to $31 billion to the production of cathode and anode materials used in lithium-ion batteries and advanced battery minerals sourced in the United States.
According to a tax presentation by the company, EVelution stands to recover either or both Section 45X or 48C of the IRA, the Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit. The energy project credit is a one-time ITC equal to 30% of the amount of invested capital in a mineral processing facility used for EV batteries.
Prior to forming EVelution in October 2021, co-founder and chief executive officer Navaid Alam was president of commodities trading firm Cobham Capital for 21 years, and was also an attorney at Clifford Chance and other firms. Michel-Garcia also spent four years at Cobham Capital after practicing law in various firms for over two decades.
In October 2022, EVelution signed a memorandum of understanding to partner with Trafigura for the supply of raw materials and marketing of cobalt sulphate and nickel sulphate from the Arizona facility.
