Almost a million Rohingya live at the Kutupalong camp after fleeing from Rakhine state in the face of atrocities by the army of Myanmar in 2017.
Solar home systems (SHS') have been provided by the Bangladeshi government and various international non-governmental and humanitarian organizations to light the homes of the refugees and solar also powers water pumps and filtration systems, to further improve living standards.
While there is electricity grid coverage in areas near the camp, the refugee accommodation is not connected. One international aid agency official has said the technology is familiar to many of the Rohingya as people were found carrying SHS' salvaged from Rakhine state. Mohammad Shamsud Douza, additional refugee relief and repatriation commissioner in Cox’s Bazar, confirmed some residents of the camp had installed solar home systems they arrived with.
The Switzerland-based International Organization for Migration has equipped 27 facilities across the camps with solar, including at its health centers, female safe spaces, distribution points, offices, and water supply networks, according to a report by the UN-related organization. The report highlighted the savings made as a result, giving the example of the $200 daily fuel bill to power diesel generators for two of its health centers.
UAE humanitarian program Beyond2020 has said it will deploy solar lighting systems for almost 4,500 people at the Kutupalong camp and French non-profit Electricians Without Borders (EWB) will install the devices according to a press statement from the Emirati entity. The EWB has previously fitted 240 solar home systems and 640 solar lamps at the camp.
Rohingya at the newly built refugee camp in Bhasan Char, an island in the Hatiya sub-district of Noakhali, have also benefited from solar systems installed to supplement diesel power generation.
Bangladesh boasts around 6 million off-grid solar home systems with a total generation capacity of 262 MW and the World Bank has estimated the government installation drive has enabled 20 million Bangladeshis to access electricity.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/02/bifacial-n-type-topcon-cell-with-22-6-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 2, 2021",Bifacial n-type TOPCon cell with 22.6% efficiency,"A group of scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the United States has fabricated a screen-printed bifacial n-type silicon solar cell with a large area of 239 cm².
The device was built with an ion-implanted homogeneous boron emitter on the front side and a carrier-selective tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) on the rear side. “The cell was developed using commercial tools,” research co-author, Young Woo Ok, told pv magazine. TOPCon is currently being investigated by major manufacturers as a route to efficiencies beyond 25%, but higher costs compared to PERC have limited its development so far.
The passivated contact was implanted through low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) on the rear side of a 180 micron thick Czochralski wafer. “Since LPCVD grows poly-Si on both sides of the wafer, we implemented a masking process to etch poly-Si from front side,” the academics explained.
The cell was then annealed at 855 degrees Celsius for polysilicon crystallization and dopant activation and the boron emitter was passivated by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Silicon nitride masks were applied on the cell's edges to protect them during the process.
The front side metallization was made with floating busbars (FB) using dual-print. The grid fingers were screen-printed with a fire-through paste made of silver and aluminum, and the busbars were then printed with a non-fire-through silver paste to prevent damage to the cell layers. The sample was finally fired in an industrial-style belt furnace at a temperature of 770 degrees Celsius and, at the end of this process, the protection masks were removed.
Tests conducted on the cell showed that it reached a maximum efficiency of 22.6%, an open-circuit voltage of 702 mV, a short-circuit current of 40 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 79.7%.
The cell was described in the study Fully screen-printed bifacial large area 22.6% N-type Si solar cell with lightly doped ion-implanted boron emitter and tunnel oxide passivated rear contact, recently published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.
This comes the same day that manufacturing giant Longi set a new record for n-type TOPCon cells at 25.21%. However, in another study published more recently, the U.S. group investigated optimizations to doping profile, surface concentration, recombination current density, and sheet resistance of the ion-implanted boron emitter. Through simulated results, it raised the cell efficiency to 22.9% and concluded that, with busbarless contacts, the device may also achieve an efficiency of 23.5%.
the June edition of pv magazine Global will be published on Monday, and features an in-depth look at the deposition processes used in TOPCon cell manufacturing. Visit our online shop to subscribe.

The minister of popular power of electric power of Venezuela, Néstor Luis Reverol Torres, has announced that the first photovoltaic system in the country was installed, located in Guárico state. pv magazine has requested more information on the system, which is stated to be “part of the actions carried out by the workers of the Corporación Eléctrica Nacional S.A (Corpoelec), for the protection of the electricity service.”
Reverol explained that the solar panels are “made with 100% Venezuelan engineering,” and that they strengthen the continuity of the electricity service and demonstrate the commitment of the government of President Nicolás Maduro to comply with the sustainable development goals established by the United Nations (UN) to develop renewable sources of energy. No further details of the project have been released.
This system was built in the Sombrero II substation and will feed the broadband transport network continuously and thus guarantee, in the event of any failure, the operation of the voice and data system necessary to keep the National Electric System (SEN) working.
In 2018, Venezuela announced the manufacture of its first solar cell: the development and research took about a year and was carried out at the facilities of the National Center for Optical Technologies (CNTO), attached to CIDA and located in the Libertador de Mérida municipality. The activity was financed by the National Fund for Science, Technology and Innovation (FONACIT).
President Maduro expressed his desire to promote the development of a solar industry in 2013. Since then, however, only small, off-grid photovoltaic projects have been carried out, for isolated regions. Most of the systems were installed within the framework of the Sembrando Luz program, which depends on Fundelec's renewable energy management. The program was founded in 2005 by the Bolivarian government “within the framework of the policies of social inclusion and diversification of energy sources, promoted through the VI Joint Commission Cuba-Venezuela Comprehensive Cooperation Agreement, and aimed at serving communities [which are] isolated.”
In 2014, the Venezuelan government stated that it wanted to install about 523 MW in renewable energy projects in the 2013-2019 period, of which about 478 MW corresponded to wind projects.
According to the latest figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency, the Latin American country had around 5 MW of installed solar power at the end of 2020.

The funds will be assigned through a series of competitive calls and projects located in areas affected by a decline in coal mining will be prioritized. Each selected project may secure funds to cover up to 50% of the costs for buying and installing the PV system.
Of the program's total budget, CZK1 billion will be allocated for projects not exceeding 1 MW in size and CZK3.5 billion will be earmarked for solar installations with a capacity of over 1 MW. For both project categories, the first call will be launched on June 12.
With this new scheme, large scale solar will be subsidized again in Czechia after the government closed, abruptly, a feed-in tariff scheme in 2011 and introduced, later, a few retroactive measures to reduce the level of support granted to the projects operating under that mechanism. Ever since, no more utility scale solar plants were built across the country.
According to the Czech government, the country has, currently, 2.2 GW of installed solar power.
In 2019, new PV additions totaled around 50 MW. Most of this capacity was deployed under the Green Savings Program for distributed generation and the country's solar-plus-storage scheme.

A stock market update issued by Scatec yesterday did not specify the tariff secured by the three 50 MW slices of solar capacity but stated: “The tariffs awarded to the projects fall within the range of the previously awarded preferred bidders.” In March, pv magazine reported the 2 GW ‘rescue mitigation power procurement program' held by the South African government had attracted final tariff bids ranging from ZAR1,468-1,885/MWh (€87.73-112.65), for an average auction price of ZAR1,575/MWh.
The technology-neutral procurement round was held to secure additional power generation capacity to plug shortfalls in supply in South Africa, particularly to the nation's mining sector.
pv magazine did not name Scatec among the preferred bidders to the tender in March but mentioned “a further three eligible bids totaling 150 MW.” Our previous report also indicated the preferred bidders named by the government, when it published the results, included proposals for solar and wind power facilities, as well as battery storage and liquefied natural gas – including floating gas plants.
However, Scatec yesterday said its solar capacity was the only proposal to feature renewable energy generation. pv magazine has asked the developer if it can explain the apparent discrepancy.
Yesterday's update stated the overall solar-plus-storage project will cost an estimated $1 billion, 80% of which will be debt funded by banks and “development finance institutions,” with financial close expected this year. Scatec said it expects to obtain grid connection by the end of next year.
Scatec will provide engineering, procurement and construction services for the complex as well as operations and maintenance. The Norwegian developer will own 51% of the project with Cape Town-based developer H1 Holdings owning the balance under the Black Economic Empowerment policy brought in by the government to help address the imbalances of the apartheid era.
pv magazine previously reported, the tender – which closed for bidding in December – attracted 28 bidders for 5,117 MW of capacity.

Michael Jordan, senior adviser to the Power Africa initiative run by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), said the president intends to triple its climate change-related adaptation finance by 2024.
Jordan was speaking as a panelist during a webinar held by London-based continental business group Invest Africa to debate donor financing to the African energy sector. The event was held on Africa Day – May 25 – which marks the foundation of the Organisation of African Unity in 1963.
The Power Africa scheme is supporting African utilities in developing new business models, particularly in the low-margin markets of sub-Saharan Africa, Jordan told the webinar, and is also exploring the productive use of solar power in agriculture and other sectors. Agrivoltaics is a good example of how innovation can drive down African power costs, the USAID adviser said.
Solar PV could disrupt the fossil fuel industry and help with two of the biggest sustainability challenges of our times: biodiversity loss and food production. In Q1, 2021, pv magazine’s UP initiative shone a spotlight on agrivoltaics. Read our coverage here.
“There is a great opportunity for innovation to bring down the cost of power, make utilities more sustainable [and] help private and public sector investments,” said Jordan. “Innovation is not only key but essential and needs to be supported through all avenues, whether it's public or private sector or a combination of both.”
Jordan pointed to clean power mini-grids as the most successful form of renewables deployment across the continent but said such systems still require an element of subsidy. Power Africa, he added, is deploying such mini-grids to power healthcare facilities in six African nations.
That need for financial feasibility was echoed by Ammarens Bruggenkamp, manager for energy in West Africa and the Middle East and North Africa region for Dutch development bank FMO. Stating the Dutch state entity wants to venture into solar and wind power deployment to help plug a financing shortfall – with an additional emphasis on energy storage, mini-grids and off-grid systems – Bruggenkamp said the energy investment environment was crucial. “It all depends on the regulatory framework and the environment, and also the feasibility,” she said.
James Mackay, strategy and Africa south market lead for energy at accountant PwC South Africa, pointed to recent data which indicated the volume of power generation capacity added across Africa last year was at its lowest since 2008, with most of the new plants government-funded fossil fuel facilities.
Mackay highlighted estimates the energy transition could mean as much as US$1 trillion of public money could be invested into stranded fossil fuel assets and Angela Nalikka, manager for national and regional power systems at the African Development Bank (AfDB), said fossil fuels were the biggest hurdle to renewables deployment on the continent.
Commenting on the role played by her employer in disbursing donor funds, Nalikka said: “The AfDB approach is in three ways: market building, preparation, and catalytic financing. We grant funds for project preparation. In most cases, they are small projects. Lastly, we provide catalytic funding. We can provide local currency options in many of the projects.”

EuPD Research says in a new report that it is optimistic about the market for residential storage systems in Germany.
The Bonn-based research company said it recorded an increase of 106,000 home storage units in the country last year. It expects 150,000 new battery storage systems to be installed this year.
However, some PV installers are missing out on this growth. In its “Global PV Installer Monitor 2020/2021″ report, EuPD Research says that one-quarter of installers currently do not offer any storage products. There are several reasons for this, but price is playing a particularly key role and has been mentioned as one of the main obstacles to storage deployment for several years.
Prices for storage solutions fell by 21% between 2017 and 2020. According to EUPD Research, a kilowatt-hour of storage capacity fell in cost from €889 in 2017 to €699 in 2020. However, lack of demand and low knowledge are also why many installers are still not offering storage.

The announcement was given by South Korean floating PV specialist Scotra, which will provide its floating structures for the project through a US$4 million supply agreement. Construction on the facility is scheduled to start in August and be finalized in August.
The project, which is being developed by Taiwan's Water Resources Agency, is planned to be built with 34,263 solar modules with a power output of 400 W each, on a 13-hectare surface.
Scotra had previously provided its structures for a 2 MW floating project at the Fengsan dam, located in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.
A lack of land for large scale solar power projects has recently prompted the government of the island to turn to floating PV. The largest project under development is a 181 MW floating solar project at the Changhua Coastal Industrial Park, in the Changbin Lunwei East district of the island.
The Taiwanese government aims to install 20 GW of solar by 2025 – including 3 GW of rooftop installations. According to the latest figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency, the island had approximately 5.81 GW at the end of 2020.

Solar Cloth, a startup based in Mandelieu-la-Napoule, France, said this week that it has developed new products that will be used to provide on-board electricity for Renault Trucks.
The French company says vehicle-integrated photovoltaics (VIPV) will be a key element in sustainable mobility.
Over the past two years, it has managed to remove a number of technical obstacles to effectively deploy VIPV in road and maritime transport.
Solar Cloth integrates thin films via an ecological, solvent-free thermal fusion process. It said that it can produce racing sails that are light and “undeformable,” among other products.
It produces its solar fabrics with films made of copper, indium, gallium and selenide (CIGS) and amorphous silicon and germanium (aSiGe) encapsulated into flexible, structured textiles.

Today, indium tin oxide (ITO) is the most commonly used material, but the relative scarcity of indium could soon become a problem.
With the growing need for transparent and semitransparent solar cells – either as part of a tandem device where light needs to reach multiple layers stacked on top of each other, or for other solar glass and other integrated cell concepts, scientists are hard at work seeking alternative transparent electrode materials.
A group led by Penn State University in the United States investigated a new method to grow a very thin, continuous layer of gold onto a perovskite solar cell as the top electrode layer. And while gold is also a rare and expensive material, the group is convinced its approach offers an alternate, efficient route to fabricating perovskite and tandem solar cells.
“We've shown we can make electrodes from a very thin, almost few atomic layers of gold,” said Shashank Priya, associate vice president for research and professor of materials science and engineering at Penn State. “The thin gold layer has high electrical conductivity and at the same time it doesn't interfere with the cell's ability to absorb sunlight.”
Key to the electrode layer was the use of a chromium seed layer, which serves to spread the gold evenly into a continuous film, with high light transmittance and conductivity. “Normally, if you grow a thin layer of something like gold, the nanoparticles will couple together and gather like small islands,” explained Dong Yang, assistant research professor of materials science and engineering at Penn State. “Chromium has a large surface energy that provides a good place for the gold to grow on top of, and it actually allows the gold to form a continuous thin film.”
The group then incorporated this gold electrode into a perovskite solar cell, which it measured at 19.8% efficiency, and further incorporated the perovskite cell into a tandem device, stacked on top of a silicon heterojunction cell. This device reached an efficiency of 28.3%, improving on the HJT cell’s initial 23.3% efficiency. Both devices are described in the paper 28.3%-efficiency perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell by optimal transparent electrode for high efficient semitransparent top cell, published in Nano Energy.
The group further stated that the perovskite cells it fabricated are “stable and maintain high efficiencies over time in laboratory tests”, without offering details.

ABSOLAR, a PV industry association in Brazil, reported this week that the country has added another gigawatt of solar over the past two months, pushing it past the 9 GW mark for cumulative operational PV capacity.
Strong growth in the distributed-generation PV segment is driving the market, along with a growing number of bilateral power purchase agreements (PPAs) for large-scale solar plants.
Separately, Brazil-based consultancy Greeener said in a new report that PV module demand hit 4,950 MW in Brazil last year.
The Brazilian government supports distributed generation through Convention 16/15 (Convenio ICMS 16/2015). It exempts the owners of solar systems up to 1 MW in size from paying the ICMS state sales tax, under a net metering regime open to projects no larger than 5 MW.
There are currently about 13.38 GW of unsubsidized solar power projects in advanced stages of development, with permits to start commercial operations.
“It is interesting to note that, in this project pipeline, there are at least 8.4 GW of projects that have also secured a power purchase agreement,” Greener CEO Marcio Takata told pv magazine in April.
Just five projects with capacities ranging from 600 MW to 1 GW account for around 3.6 GW of all capacity under signed PPAs in Brazil.

The PV plant will sell power to Swedish polymer-based products provider Nolato Group through Alight’s electricity trading partner Bixia, and will cover around 15% of the company's electricity demand.
Construction on the facility is expected to be finalized in April 2022.
“We have 48 signed solar PPAs to date, of which three are grid connected [and] large scale, and the rest are behind the meter,” Alight's CEO, Harald Överholm, told pv magazine. “Their combined capacity is about 50 MW.”
In December, Alight had obtained a five-year PPA for an 18 MW solar park with Swedish restaurant and catering specialist Martin & Servera.
Sweden reached an installed PV capacity of 1.09 GW at the end of December, according to provisional figures released by the Swedish solar energy association, Svensk Solenergi, which are based on data from the Swedish Energy Agency. Most of this capacity, however, is represented by rooftop PV arrays installed under the country's solar rebate scheme for rooftop solar.
Only a few megawatt-sized PV plants have been built in the country to date. These include projects developed by local municipality-owned utilities in places such as Kalmar, Luleå, Falu, Trollhättan and Lidköping.

Ukrainian financial news service Finbalance on Monday reported local developers had already won significant payments from the state-owned entity set up as guaranteed purchaser of clean electricity.
London-based lawyer Tomas Vail – of Vail Dispute Resolution, which will represent Lithuanian company Modus Energy International BV in its claim against Kiev – has told pv magazine: “Many other renewable energy producers are also engaged in local court litigation with the state-owned guaranteed buyer in respect of outstanding debts, and reports indicate they have so far been able to recover debts in the amount of UAH700 million [€20.8 million].”
The latest edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big look at the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movements amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
Vail said the Modus claim differs from the others because it is the first that has been lodged in the context of an alleged breach of the Energy Charter Treaty international agreement, to which Ukraine and Lithuania are both signatories. With the case due to be heard by the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, the lawyer added: “Whereas … domestic claims may be constrained by the budget of the guaranteed buyer, investment treaty claims are levied against Ukraine and its state organs, agencies and instrumentalities, in respect of Ukraine’s obligations under international law, such as those reflected in the Energy Charter Treaty.”
The Finbalance report referred to by Vail – which pv magazine has read using an online translation service – claimed the UAH700 million settlements previously settled with clean power developers have now been supplemented by successful actions, at the Economic Court of Kiev, by ‘Ajax Dnepr', which the website reported successfully claimed UAH26.1 million (€776,000); ‘New Ukrainian Energy Solutions' (UAH22.9 million); ‘Solar Energy Plus' (UAH16.1 million); ‘Tavan Solar' (UAH13.4 million); ‘Euroimex' (UAH9.7 million); ‘Goodwelly Ukraine' (UAH6.9 million); ‘Ekoprod CJSC' (UAH5.5 million); and ‘Ukrainian Solar Group-Vinogradovo' (UAH4.9 million), for a total bill of UAH806 million for the energy offtaker.
Referring to the Finbalance story, Vail added: “[Electricity transmission system operator] Ukrenergo reported debts of UAH22.4 billion [€669 million] at the end of 2020 and debts of UAH15.8 billion in mid-May 2021, in respect of 2020, with new debts in respect of the first half of 2021 – in an, as yet uncertain amount – also accruing.”
The government of Ukraine retroactively reduced FIT payments for clean power generators in August, to ease the financial burden on the public purse, with the holders of signed contracts suffering reductions of 2.5-15%.
A note issued by London based legal and tax consultancy CMS Cameron McKenna Nabarro Olswang LLP last month, which referred to the minutes of a Ukrainian government cabinet meeting, stated Modus was set to suffer a FIT reduction of 15% on payments it had agreed to 2029. The note said the payments related to three solar farms owned by Modus in Ukraine which have a combined generation capacity of around 47 MW.
Russian news agency Interfax has reported Modus is claiming €11.5 million and said the company, part of the Lithuanian Modus Group, was not among the clean power developers who signed up to Kiev's proposal to reduce FIT payments.

According to the manufacturer, the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin (ISFH), Germany, has confirmed that the efficiency of its commercial-sized monocrystalline, n-type, bifacial product has been raised from 25.09% to 25.21%. No technical details were disclosed on how the result was achieved.
Longi also announced it achieved two more efficiency records.
It claimed to have reached a power conversion efficiency of 25.02% for a p-type monocrystalline bifacial TOPCon solar cell and explained it is the first time that a cell based on this technology surpasses the 25% barrier. Furthermore, it said to have achieved a 25.26% efficiency for a monocrystalline heterojunction solar cell.
The manufacturer added that both results were confirmed by the ISFH and did not give an explanation for the technical improvements.
“With the ambitious goals we have set for ourselves, our approach is to stay close to the essence of technology by selecting the best technical route, maximizing product performance potential and proactively ushering in the changes needed to achieve the technical transformation,” said Li Hua, head of the company's Cell R&D Center.
Longi is currently the world's biggest solar manufacturer, by market value and sales revenue, and shipped 24.5 GW of panels last year to generate revenue of RMB54.58 billion ($8.43 billion). At the turn of the year, the company boasted annual production capacities of 85 GW, 30 GW and 50 GW for its mono wafers, cells and panels, respectively.

The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) allocates federal funds to green energy projects across the country. At the recent Australian Energy Week event, the agency’s chief executive, Darren Miller, gave a speech in which he upped the ante in terms of where Australia’s renewable energy generation should be targeting. He says the country should be trying to generate “five to 10 times more than is supplied by our electricity system today.”
“This electricity will not only be used to provide zero emissions lighting, heating and cooling to our homes and businesses, but will be used to power our transport and heavy industry – either directly or through the production of hydrogen,” Miller wrote in a LinkedIn post. “With the right mix of storage and peaking technologies, transmission and interconnection, and demand side flexibility, we can get to a scale that allows Australia to transform our domestic economy and supply clean energy to other countries without the same natural resources.”
Matt Walden, ARENA’s director of business development and transactions, expressed similar sentiments in a speech at the Australian Hydrogen Conference in Sydney last week. Walden described hydrogen as front and center of the agency’s investments, with both men framing hydrogen as an ideal medium for Australia to export its surplus clean power.
However, Kobad Bhavnagri – global head of industry and building decarbonization for BloombergNEF (BNEF) – said that the economics of Australia’s hydrogen export market remain “poor.” He attributed this to the high cost of transport, coupled with the cost of processing hydrogen at each end – for example, “cracking” ammonia molecules to turn them back into pure hydrogen.
Yet superpowers like Germany remain undeterred and are eager to pursue close alliances with Australia, as they see it as one of the most promising hydrogen suppliers in the world.
“Australia can become the clean energy superpower – and make ‘shipping the sunshine' a very profitable reality,” said Christoph von Speßhardt, chief executive of the German-Australian Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
