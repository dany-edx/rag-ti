Northwest will specialize in the export of hydrogen to European countries and the implementation of measures to reduce the carbon footprint of export-oriented enterprises. Vostochny will supply hydrogen to Asian countries, as well as develop hydrogen infrastructure in the transport and energy sectors. Finally, the Arctic cluster is tasked with providing a low-carbon electricity supply to the Russian Arctic,” reads the document. The main focus will be on steam reforming of methane and coal gasification, combined with carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies. “The first stage is designed for the next three and a half years,” Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said in a meeting with other representatives of the government. The large export-oriented production facilities should start operations between 2035 and 2050. “The development of hydrogen energy will reduce the risks of losing energy markets,” concluded Mishustin.
In recognition of power-to-X (PtX) technologies, the German government recently underlined the role of fuels from renewable energy in air and sea transport. It considers the U.S., Australia, Chile, and Argentina the most promising countries for PtX, and confirmed its interest to make public funding available. “In their early stages, new technologies need financial support to get off the ground. This also applies to so-called PtL—power-to-liquid fuels. Alongside regulation, players in this market require assistance in the launch phase,” Federal Minister for the Environment Svenja Schulze said earlier this month. The Federal Ministry for the Environment is supporting the development at two different locations. The Lab in Lausitz should be opened at the end of August, while the Berlin Hub should focus on developing and emerging countries. The National Hydrogen Strategy includes a budget of €600 million which the Federal Ministry for the Environment will use to promote fuels derived from electricity for air and sea travel.
Emirate-based privately-owned special project vehicle company Helios awarded a contract to perform a technical study for a new green hydrogen and green ammonia project to German industrial engineering and steel production company ThyssenKrupp. This move suggests that years of climate diplomacy and a focus on hydrogen from the German government is paying off for German companies, which are expected to maintain a footing in the Middle East, banking on hydrogen-related opportunities. “A water electrolysis plant, as well as a facility for sustainable ammonia production, are planned to be constructed at Kizad in Abu Dhabi, UAE, based on ThyssenKrupp technology. It will be the first commercial plant to produce CO2-free green ammonia from renewable resources in the UAE,” reads the note released on Monday. The last months witnessed an increase in competition between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, also in the realm of hydrogen production. “We are building both on our innovative technology solutions as well as on ThyssenKrupp's regional and local footprint and long heritage as a partner to the region,” said Sami Pelkonen, CEO of the company's Uhde business unit.
The US Department of Energy (DOE) awarded US$1 million for a collaborative project between three U.S. companies – Southern Company Gas, Electro-Active Technologies, and T2M Global – to advance next-generation clean hydrogen technologies. The project seeks to develop low-cost renewable hydrogen generation for use in transportation and distributed energy applications. “We are excited for this opportunity to work with our partners and the DOE in advancing the wet waste-to-clean hydrogen pathway and to help bring the hydrogen economy to reality,” said Robin Lanier, renewable gas director for Southern Company Gas. The project targets distributed generation of hydrogen from food waste, diverting the waste from landfills.
U.S.-based hydrogen solutions company Plug Power announced an $84 million investment into a green hydrogen production plant in Georgia, which should produce 15 tons of liquid green hydrogen per day. “Plug Power affirms its continued commitment to establishing the first North American green hydrogen supply network,” reads a note released on Tuesday. It adds that Plug Power is already the largest buyer of liquid hydrogen globally and has built more hydrogen refueling stations than any other company in the world. “Plug Power’s newest production plant is a result of increasing customer demand,” said Sanjay Shrestha, general manager of energy solutions and chief strategy officer for Plug Power. The Camden County plant joins previously announced green hydrogen facilities in South Central Pennsylvania and the Western New York Science, Technology and Advanced Manufacturing Park (STAMP), through which the company aims to produce more than 500 tons of green hydrogen per day by 2025. “Together with Plug Power’s existing plant in Tennessee, acquired in 2020, and its PEM stack and electrolyzer Innovation Center in Rochester, N.Y., this plant further strengthens the company’s position as a leader in advancing the green hydrogen ecosystem,” reads the note. The Georgia gas production plant is expected to be completed by the end of this year.
British-American hydrogen-electric aircraft developer ZeroAvia achieved its first major milestone for the HyFlyer II program. “The ground test… involved ZeroAvia’s flight-intent 600kW powertrain, pulling ZeroAvia’s new 15-ton HyperTruck mobile ground testing platform across the tarmac. The HyperTruck, developed based on heavy-duty military trucks, is sized for the company’s ZA-2000 2MW+ powertrain, which can be used to test systems for 40-80 seat hydrogen-electric powered aircraft,” reads a note released on Tuesday about the demonstration conducted in California. The program is expected to deliver a hydrogen-electric, zero-emission propulsion system for airframes 10-20 seats in size. “The first milestone test-flights of HyFlyer II’s Dornier 228 aircraft testbed are expected to take place later this year from ZeroAvia’s UK facility in Kemble.” ZeroAvia CEO Val Miftakhov was recently selected to become a member of the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association (FCHEA) Board of Directors.
Indian Railways has tendered a hybrid hydrogen fuel cell and battery-based technology to run trains as part of its efforts to cut emissions as well as fuel costs. Initially, it plans hydrogen power-based conversion of two diesel-electric multiple unit (DEMU) rakes in the 89km Sonipat-Jind section of Northern Railway. The hydrogen fuel cell retrofit kit, along with the balance-of-plant and energy storage and hydrogen storage modules, will replace the existing power-train items onboard 1,600HP DEMUs.

Solar module maker Heliene said it will open a third North American manufacturing facility in Riviera Beach, Florida.
The 75,000-square-foot facility is Heliene’s second in the U.S., and increases its manufacturing capacity by 100 MW. The company said it will begin production at the new facility in September, following upgrades to an existing solar production line previously operated by SolarTech Universal. Heliene operates other production lines in Ontario, Canada, and Minnesota.
The company expects to announce in the coming weeks a 350 MW expansion at the Minnesota facility. That expansion is likely to include a multi-million-dollar incentive package from the state.

“The DBSA has matched GCF’s $100 million funding, thus ensuring there is a funding contribution of $200 million toward the implementation of EGIP from the two institutions,” the document reads. “Approximately $84 million of the $200 million funding will be utilized to provide Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment funding to enable the participation and ownership of local communities and small, medium and micro enterprises in renewable energy projects under the program.”
Embedded generation in South Africa includes all power plants up to 10 MW in size. But according to the DBSA, the South African government has reportedly raised this threshold to 100 MW.
“The recent announcement to exempt embedded generation projects up to 100 MW from having to apply for generation licenses is an impetus for the implementation of EGIP and the various shovel-ready embedded generation projects in the market,” it said in the request for proposal document.
The selected projects must have secured power purchase agreements with industrial or commercial off-takers for a minimum of 15 years. The proposed projects should have completed feasibility studies, with all relevant permits and licenses. Their capacity will range between 10 MW and 75 MW.
Interested IPPs will have time until Sept. 30 to submit their proposals.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/10/facade-bipv-modules-designed-with-stone-veneers/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,FRANCE,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 10, 2021",Facade BIPV modules designed with stone veneers,"Researchers at Germany’s Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH) have developed two different techniques to integrate stone veneers in conventional solar modules to make them suitable for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) projects in stone facades.
“With our approach, the authentic rough stone surface allows for seamless integration of PV modules, even for an observer standing at close range from the facade or touching it. It is possible to use original equipment manufacturer (OEM) standard modules and to apply the front stone on them for costs comparable to glass printing,” ISFH scientist, Arnaud Morlier, told pv magazine. “The panels could be ready for mass production in a short term, as the stone veneers are commercially available,” he added. “All types of crystalline silicon or thin-film modules are suitable for this.”
One technique consists of replacing the front glass pane of the panels with a stone veneer sheet, and the other involves lamination of the natural stones veneer directly onto the front glass pane. The stone veneers used are 1.5 mm thin resin-based products reinforced with glass fibers and a stone layer up to 0.5 mm thick.
The German group was able to fabricate four large-area modules with a size of 1,220×610 mm and a weight of 13 kg each. All panels are based on bifacial heterojunction solar cells with a size of 156×156 mm encapsulated between two sheets of polyolefin encapsulation film.
After showing photovoltaic efficiencies of up to 11.2% with single-cell laminates, larger test modules have been fabricated. Some modules were fabricated by adding the stone veneer in a single lamination step and the others were first laminated like conventional glass-backsheet products and then laminated a second time for the addition of the veneers, thus showing that the stone veneers can be added on an already manufactured module, or be integrated during module production.
The stone veneers used and especially the resin layer absorb light in the UV and visible wavelength range. This absorption can be reduced by employing optimized resins. The natural patterns in the veneers, however, are said to cause significant spatial variations in photocurrent, which may, in turn, cause hot spots during PV operations, the scientists warned. This issue, however, may be solved by checking the homogeneity of the veneer translucence before lamination. Another solution, they add, could be fabricating smaller panels that allow a proper adjustment of currents within a module string.
Because of these inhomogeneities, while single strings in the modules achieved maximum efficiency of about 10%, the modified modules achieved a maximum efficiency of around 8.5%.  For comparison, the modules used for the experiment without modification showed an efficiency of 20.7%. This halved efficiency, according to the German group, is in line with those of other modules designed with other coloring techniques including printed images or monochromatic interference coatings, but has the advantage of offering what it calls a “natural feeling and natural surface texture.” Furthermore, the panels can also be used as partial shading walls or semi-transparent roof elements.
The two techniques are described in the paper Photovoltaic Modules with the Look and Feel of a Stone Façade for Building Integration, which was recently published in RRL Solar.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/10/harnessing-heat-loss-with-thermionics/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CANADA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 10, 2021",Harnessing heat loss with thermionics,"Energy lost as heat is one of the fundamental, and largely unavoidable, challenges to improving solar cell efficiencies. Heat generated in the device limits the conversion of light into electricity, and also causes degradation of the device, negatively affecting both performance and lifetime.
Thermionics (TI) is an alternate approach that uses heat from the sun to generate electricity, rather than light as in photovoltaics. TI has been known by scientists for a long time, but has not proved itself as practical as PV as a way to generate electricity. However, recently scientists have begun to explore TI effects in solar PV cell materials, and the possibility of combining the two to both increase efficiency and reduce the negative effects of heat on a device – an approach known as photon enhanced thermionic emission (PETE).
The potential of this approach is evaluated in a new paper published in nature communications, Semiconductor thermionics for next generation solar cells: photon enhanced or pure thermionic. The research, led by scientists at Canada’s University of British Columbia, notes that previous work in this area has simplified certain aspects to focus on others – an approach which “does not enable a realistic analysis of these photothermal phenomena and devices based on them,” according to the group.
The group concludes that while both PETE and thermionics alone are promising pathways to addressing the thermal limitations of PV, there is a wide range of challenges to be overcome before it could make any meaningful contributions. These include ensuring temperature stability of the various materials that make up a solar PV cell, increasing the likelihood of thermally excited electrons being emitted and collected, minimizing recombination, and many more. “The ultimate challenge is to combine all the desired properties into a single material or heterostructure,” the group states.
The group sought to improve understanding of TI/PETE, and hopes to foster further interest in the approach. “Overall, the concept of semiconductor thermionics is still in early stages and much remains to be investigated on the experimental front,” they conclude, noting that many of the challenges have been identified already. “We point out these issues and possible solutions to both fundamental and practical challenges, in order to provide a broader perspective as well as to motivate further research into semiconductor thermionics.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/10/vehicle-to-grid-outlook/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"AUGUST 10, 2021",Vehicle-to-grid outlook,"From pv magazine 08/2021
In the energy storage industry it can be easy to think that the growth trajectory is exceptional. Indeed, six months ago, in the IHS Markit Grid-Connected Energy Storage Market Tracker (our bi-annual evaluation of the energy storage industry), we predicted that the industry would double in size in 2021, with installations topping 10 GW for the first time. This is no doubt impressive. However, the changes underway in the automotive space are happening at an even larger scale. With this huge scale, there will inevitably be speculation on how to exploit the idle batteries sitting in the millions of EVs parked at any one time as a grid asset and an enabler for higher penetrations of renewable energy. This interface with the electricity grid, where EVs both charge and discharge, is called vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and could operate at a scale that eclipses the current and projected stationary storage market.

The cost at which this storage capacity could be deployed is, potentially, significantly lower than using separate stationary batteries, as is becoming increasingly common in a range of sectors today. The reason behind this is relatively simple – the capital cost of procuring the storage asset is met by the vehicle owner and is separate from its role as a grid asset. In addition to that, the incremental increase in cost of a bidirectional charger (the key component that needs to be added to an EV/EV charger to enable V2G, compared to the conventional alternative) is falling rapidly, with near parity expected in the next five years. This just leaves the cost of enabling communication and control over the dispatch of the vehicle’s battery, and there are positive signs that this could also be incredibly low.
Automotive OEMs already have over-air communication with their vehicles in many cases, and new EV chargers now invariably come with communications hardware to schedule charging. These communication and control interfaces could be leveraged to control V2G with minimal additional complexity. The combination of these factors will potentially enable V2G to be used as energy storage at an incredibly low cost.
With significantly lower capital requirements and potentially larger scale, the use case of V2G assets is likely to be different to that of stationary storage. As domestic EV chargers are typically 7 kW, and EV battery capacity is 50 kWh to 70 kWh, V2G is inherently a long duration (10-plus hours) asset. The lower cost will enable V2G assets to be profitable on wholesale electricity markets over a narrower price spread than traditional stationary storage assets. For these reasons, it is perfectly placed to provide long-duration balancing services at the intraday scale and play a large potential role in stabilizing wholesale markets under higher penetrations of renewable energy.
While this analysis certainly paints a rosy picture of the prospects for V2G technology, there remain significant barriers to its adoption in the short and medium term. The industry largely remains in the pilot and commercial trial phase, with large challenges remaining before deployment at large scale can take place. While some of these barriers – such as licensing difficulties and lack of bidirectional support in charging protocols – will be overcome in due course, others may be more difficult for the industry.
Although the aggregation of many thousands of EVs has the potential to form a highly valuable grid asset, a key challenge is that it will offer very little value to each individual EV owner. V2G will earn very little revenue per vehicle – this will raise the question of how vehicle owners should be incentivized to make their vehicles available for V2G. Equally difficult is the issue of battery degradation; while there are some clues that batteries will last longer than the vehicle under normal use, there is little information on how V2G affects battery lifetime. This means that in the short term, at least, this will remain a major concern in the minds of many vehicle owners.
In light of the tremendous potential of this technology, with the opportunity to provide storage at huge scale and very low cost, it now comes to the industry stakeholders to overcome these barriers of low customer value and concerns over battery degradation. It remains to be seen whether an effective commercial proposition can be made amongst the web of stakeholders, including auto OEMs, energy suppliers, and flexibility providers, in order to effectively unlock the value of V2G.
Collaboration between these industry players has never been achieved at such an enormous scale before. But is likely to be the determining factor in whether V2G can be an effective enabler for grid storage and decarbonization in the
years to come.

Whether module prices move up or down this year essentially depends on the development of the international market. If a fourth wave of Covid-19 can be stopped or slowed in time, then the market should be in quite good shape on both the supply and demand sides. If the Delta variant of the virus is not contained, however, there will be further bottlenecks in Asian production facilities and in the rest of the supply chain, which could make the future development of the market difficult to predict.
This is a tough time for both the industry and our world at large. We do not yet know when regular supply chain and transport systems will return, or if they will return in the shape we knew them before. With so much uncertainty in the world, there can be little possibility for certainty about module prices.
After all, this is a time when three billionaires, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, are tussling it out in a civil space race where the sky is apparently no longer the limit.
On the heels of Virgin Galactic founder Branson, Amazon CEO Bezos also had himself launched into orbit last month, just to show that he can do it too. Only time will tell how the ambitions of Tesla and Space-X CEO Musk, the third in the group, will shape up in this regard. Apparently, a mission for a circumnavigation of the Earth with four space tourists is already planned for September, but without Musk himself being on the passenger list. His actual vision goes well beyond the megalomania of his competitors – he wants to colonize Mars.
To me this immediately raises the question: What is the point? Do we not have much bigger problems at the moment than which super-rich person will be the first in space, or who will be the youngest or oldest space tourist? Surely we should be able to smoothly trade amongst ourselves before embarking on outer space discovery?

After the first year of the pandemic in 2020, the natural world had just begun to recover from overflowing air traffic caused by growing, far too cheap, international tourism and business-related short air hops. But here too, a race within the airline industry has begun to catch up with former flight volumes and frequency. Ryanair is in the process of ordering 100 or more large aircraft from Boeing. Apparently, the low-cost airline wants to fill the gaps in the industry left by the insolvencies and consolidation of other airlines as quickly as possible by expanding its own operations. I see this development as even more alarming than the space plans of the three billionaires – for the time being, at least.
Nevertheless, the idea of taking well-paying private individuals into space by using huge amounts of fuel and accepting the emission of tons of CO2 lacks, in my opinion, any rational basis. “Astrotourism” in its current form is simply ruthlessly destructive of resources, and as far as I know, the gain in knowledge for more important missions is minimal.
The images of the expensive space hoppers shown on TV – that is all they are at the moment – are particularly hard to stomach in light of the climate-change-related environmental catastrophes of the recent past.
While billionaires congratulate or mock each other for their supposed successes, less egregiously well-off people in many parts of the world are struggling to survive, to trade, and some are even losing all their belongings in devastating fires or major floods. The flood victims in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany likely wish that such vast sums of money, presumably untaxed, would not be squandered on fulfilling the adolescent dreams of the super-rich, but instead used to help them get back on their feet. At the very least, however, these vast sums could be invested in climate impact mitigation and climate protection instead of climate destruction.
Musk’s goal of colonizing Mars seems particularly cynical to me. What is the attraction of banishing people irretrievably to a highly hostile environment in which survival is possible only with extreme hardship and the constant threat of death? The way to this goal also leads along a road of particularly resource-devouring tests with thousands of setbacks. Every rocket launch puts a huge burden on the earth’s environment.
Now, I’m not an evolutionary biologist, but human life is tailored precisely to today’s environmental conditions through thousands of years of evolution. So why exchange optimal living conditions for completely different ones which the human organism must first adapt again for millenia? With this in mind: The sky is the limit, period!

The scientists said that heterojunction cells based on thin wafers have low absorption efficiency in the red and near-infrared portions of the solar spectrum, which in turn results in lower Jsc.
“The hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) emitter layer causes excessive reflection losses in SHJ solar cells owing to their high refractive index,” they explained. “Therefore, lowering the optical losses would improve the absorption properties of a solar cell, which is the crucial aspect for attaining high efficiency.”
The double-layered anti-reflection coating (DLARC) is based on a dielectric layer aluminum oxide placed on top of an indium tin oxide layer, with a thickness of 50 nm to 70 nm.
Via an optical simulation, the academics were able to observe that the novel layer can significantly minimize the optical losses in cells. According to their measurements, the solar cell with the aluminum oxide/indium tin oxide DLARC showed an increase in external quantum efficiency, which defines the ratio of the number of electrons in the external circuit produced by an incident photon of a given wavelength, from 76.89% to 84.34%. It also exhibited a reduction of average reflectance from 9.33% to 4.74% and an increase in Jsc 39.91 mA/cm2 to 41.13 mA/cm2, as compared to the cell fabricated with a coating based on the ITO layer alone.
“The improved optical and electrical properties lead to increase the cell efficiency from 20.95% to 21.60%,” the scientists affirmed. “These results suggest that the fabricated (aluminum oxide/indium tin oxide) DLARC can be effectively used in industrial silicon heterojunction solar cell applications.”
The scientists described the anti-reflective coating in “Improved Optical and Electrical Properties for Heterojunction Solar Cell using Al2O3/ITO Double-layer Anti-Reflective Coating,” which was recently published in Results in Physics.

India's ReNew Power has signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI) for 400 MW of round-the-clock (RTC) electricity supply.
The PPA is the first of its kind in India. The power will be supplied to New Delhi Municipal Council and utility Dadra & Nagar Haveli.
ReNew Power emerged as the winner to supply round-the-clock power last year in an auction conducted by state-owned SECI. It will supply electricity in the first year at a tariff of INR 2.90/kWh ($0.04). The tariff will increase by 3% per year for the first 15 years of the 25-year power supply deal.
“The project will be designed to operate at an 80% average annual plant load factor and will have a minimum capacity utilization factor of 70% monthly, despite being a renewable energy project,” said ReNew Power.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/10/worlds-largest-grid-forming-battery-to-begin-construction-in-australia/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"AUGUST 10, 2021",World’s largest ‘grid-forming’ battery to begin construction in Australia,"From pv magazine Australia
The Torrens Island battery is AGL Energy’s first grid-scale storage project. It will be built at the company’s gas plant, where it will continue to provide electricity as the fossil-fuel run turbines are retired.
The AUD 180 million ($131.8 million) battery isn’t Australia's largest and only has one hour of storage (it is expected to expand to four hours). However, the project will be the largest in the world with grid-forming capacity, and will undoubtedly be observed within Australia and internationally.
The system, to be delivered by Wärtsilä, will initially operate in the usual grid-following mode, meaning that the output synchronizes to the grid’s voltage waveform. It will then be switched into the more novel grid-forming mode, making it capable of providing the grid with “virtual inertia.”
System strength services and inertia have traditionally been the realm of spinning mass fossil-fuel driven turbines, but grid-forming projects hold promise as a clean substitute.
Their virtual inertia is provided by grid-forming inverters, which in this project will be provided by Germany's SMA. Also known as virtual synchronous generation, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) recently identified grid-forming technology as a top priority because of the crucial role it expects the technology will play in the clean energy transition.
While large-scale demonstrations of grid-forming storage like Torrens Island are not yet in operation, Australia has already had some success with the technology on a smaller scale. Its triumphs include the 30 MW/8 MWh Dalrymple Battery Energy Storage System, which is currently the only source of virtual inertia in the National Electricity Market.
Storage systems with grid-forming inverters independently set their internal frequency and speed, making them able to form an islanded grid by generating a frequency reference. In other words, they can continue to provide power to the network if the main grid goes down – something systems without that technology cannot do.
News of the grid-forming plans for Torren Island follows a decision by South Australia transmission provider ElectraNet to deploy two synchronous condensers in the state, with another two in the works. The primary role of these spinning machines is also to provide system strength and inertia. However, in comparison to grid-forming inverters, the solution appears to be far less flexible and unable to offer multiple services. 
SMA said it will supply 109 Medium Voltage Power Stations (MVPS-SCS4200) to Wärtsilä for Torrens Island project. It said its “MVPS-SCS4200” platform is a turnkey solution for large storage systems. With the new, robust battery central inverters Sunny Central Storage UP and coordinated medium-voltage components, the turnkey solution offers more power density, it added. The complex system is also supported by the GEMS Power Plant Controller and energy management software from Wärtsilä.
“The Torrens Island project has huge implications globally; Australia is among the leading countries in the world when it comes to high levels of renewable energy feeding into the grid at particular times of the day,” said Joshua Birmingham, director of large-scale and project solutions at SMA Australia.
Battery rollout
AGL Energy has committed to build 850 MW of battery-based assets by 2024. To that end, Torrens Island marks the first project to be constructed at the site of a fossil-fuel power plant. It won’t be the last, however, as big batteries are planned for New South Wale’s Liddell coal plant and Victoria’s Loy Yang facility.
In January, AGL Energy revealed that it had  secured both Wärtsilä and Fluence under non-exclusive framework agreements to supply up to 1 GW of large-scale battery storage.
