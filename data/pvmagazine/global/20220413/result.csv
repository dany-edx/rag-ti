https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/13/india-may-miss-2022-solar-target-of-100-gw-by-27/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 13, 2022",India may miss 2022 solar target of 100 GW by 27%,"From pv magazine India
India will fall well short of its installed solar capacity target of 100 GW by 2022, mainly due to the slow uptake of rooftop solar, according to a new report by JMK Research and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
The report highlights rooftop solar as the pain point in India’s journey to 100 GW. It projects that by December 2022, there will be a 25 GW shortfall in meeting the 40 GW rooftop solar target, compared to just 1.8 GW in the utility-scale solar target.
As of December 2021, India had installed a cumulative solar capacity of 55 GW, with grid-connected utility-scale projects contributing 77% (42.3 GW) and the balance coming from grid-connected rooftop solar (20%) and mini or micro off-grid projects (3%).
The nation is expected to add another 19 GW of solar capacity in 2022 – 15.8 GW from utility-scale and 3.5 GW from rooftop solar. This will take the cumulative utility-scale PV capacity to 58.2 GW and cumulative rooftop solar capacity to 15 GW by the end of December.
“Even with this capacity addition, about 27% of India’s 100 GW solar target would be unmet,” said Jyoti Gulia, the report's co-author and JMK Research founder.
On the current trajectory, the report finds India’s solar target of 300 GW by 2030 will be off the mark by about 86 GW.
“Utility-scale solar capacity addition is on track. India is set to achieve nearly 97% of its 60 GW target,” said Gulia. “This makes it imperative to have a more concerted effort towards expanding rooftop solar.”
Challenges
The report states that headwinds ranging from pandemic-induced supply chain disruption to deeply rooted policy restrictions have impeded the growth of India’s rooftop solar (onsite solar power) and open-access solar (offsite solar) installations.
“The anticipated 27 GW shortfall from the 2022 solar target can be attributed to a string of challenges which are slowing overall progress on renewable energy targets,” said co-author Vibhuti Garg, energy economist at IEEFA.
These challenges include regulatory roadblocks, net metering limits, the twin burdens of basic customs duty on imported cells and modules and issues with the new and renewable energy ministry's approved list of models and manufacturers, unsigned power supply agreements, banking restrictions, financing issues, delays in or rejection of open-access approval grants, and the unpredictability of future open-access charges.
“Central and state government policies and regulations must be aligned to support the solar sector overall, and especially the ailing rooftop and open access segments of the market,” said co-author Akhil Thayillam, senior research associate at JMK Research.
Recommendations
The report proposes short and long-term measures to get India back on track to meet solar targets.
Short-term measures include uniform policies to be applied nationally for at least the next five years, consistent regulations for net metering and banking facilities, and revocation of restrictions on the banking of renewable energy at least until rooftop and open-access state targets are achieved.
Long-term measures include stricter enforcement of the renewable purchase obligation; improved financial health; the potential privatization of distribution companies; reduced cross-subsidy surcharges for commercial and industrial consumers; and a capital subsidy for battery energy storage systems.
“In rooftop solar, state-level efforts such as Gujarat’s Surya Scheme need to be replicated by other states in the short-term to help in boosting capacity,” said Gulia.
“It is also likely that the government, in the short-term, will push aggressively for expediting solar capacity addition to achieve the 100 GW target by 2022 by re-allocating some of the unmet rooftop target to utility-scale generation.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/13/concentrating-solar-power-system-for-building-applications-usable-with-pv/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 13, 2022","Concentrating solar power system for building applications, usable with PV","German start-up SunOyster Energy GmbH has developed a concentrating solar technology based on parabolic mirrors that is claimed to achieve a 75% efficiency in converting direct radiation into heat.
“Our system can be used for all kinds of electric applications and, on the thermal side, for a wide range of applications from sanitary warm water over winter and district heating, solar thermal cooling, process heat for industry and feeding the heat into steam power plants for pre-heating,” the project coordinator, Carsten Corino, told pv magazine. “Clients can be single-family houses, apartment houses, commercial applications such as hotels or hospitals, industrial customers e.g. from food or textile industry, district heating operators and utilities.”
The start-up is currently producing the devices at its facility at the GreenTEC campus in Enge-Sande, North Frisia, Germany. “We want to expand our production capacity for our patented hybrid receivers in 2022 to 50 MW,” Corino stated.
The system takes its name from the oyster, as it follows the principle of closing strongly its shells in case of danger or storm.  The flagship system, the SunOyster 16 heat pvplus can supply 4.8 kW of electric power and 10 kW of heat output. The thermal receiver generating heat is made with a steel pipe with a selective absorber and may reach temperatures of up to 170 C. It can be combined with thermal chillers for room cooling. These adsorption or absorption chillers use the heat to evaporate the working fluid, drawing heat from the interior, which is released again through condensation outside of the room.
Another model is the smaller and lighter SunOyster 8, which has a premium design with rounded mirror edges following the idea that a Tesla driver would like to put it on his carport to power his car. In addition, the German start-up is also offering the PVmover, which is a purely electric product using the tracking know-how of the company. The bi-axially tracking PVmover with nine PV modules is claimed to generate 30% more electricity than conventional PV systems without trackers; it measures under 3 m in height, making its installation free of building permits in Germany.
The SunOysters may be either equipped with solar trackers or photovoltaic modules, which would both occupy the same space on the front and lateral sides of the installations. “The present price for SunOyster 16 heat with 10 kW thermal is €8,400 and for the pvplus system integrating photovoltaic modules totaling 4.8 kW is €3,800 including installation. The target price from serial production for SO8 hybrid pvplus with 3.5 kW thermal and 3.8 kWp is €5,800,” Corino further explained.
SunOyster Systems currently uses 20% efficient 390-400 W Vertex modules from Chinese manufacturer Trina Solar. “But there is some flexibility to use modules with varying sizes, too,” Corino added.
The concentrating solar technology was developed as part of the EU-funded SOCool project, which aims to bring the SunOyster system from working prototype to certification, or technology readiness level 9 (TRL 9). The TRL measures the maturity of technology components for a system and is based on a scale from one to nine, with nine representing mature technologies for full commercial application.
“This was achieved in July 2021 with the Solar Keymark Certificate and the start of commercial sales,” Corino stated, noting that several tests were conducted in Scotland, Zambia and China. “They led to various improvements of the azimuth drive and control system now incorporated in the machines.”
From these experiments, the company learned that direct radiation in Scotland is weak so that the PVmover is crucial to achieving satisfying energy yields, and that, in Zambia, the battery in the electric installation has to be dimensioned larger in order to bridge the long power cuts. In China, a leakage in the system resulted in SunOyster Systems always including its own security service in the thermal system, monitoring pressure, flow and solar fluid temperature, Corino concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/13/photovoltaics-for-electric-cooling/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SWEDEN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 13, 2022",Photovoltaics for electric cooling,"Solar photovoltaics could be the most competitive power generation technology for meeting the increasing demand for cooling due to the positive correlation between the time series of the cooling demand and the output of PV power generators.
This is the main conclusion of recent research conducted by scientists from the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden and the Europa-Universität Flensburg in Germany, in which its authors proposed a capacity expansion model to assess whether PV may be cost-effective in meeting cooling demand for seven different regions under various CO2 emission targets.
“In our study, we show that solar PV might be cost-competitive in powering electric cooling for an investment cost ranging from $165/kW to $480/kW,” the research's corresponding author, Xiaoming Kan, told pv magazine. According to him, if the cost of PV and battery storage continues to decline at a fast speed similar to what it was in the past decade, it might be cost-optimal to power electric cooling with PV in countries with low costs for the technology, such as China and India, in the coming decades. “Of course, the time may vary from region to region depending on the regional cost reduction for PV, existing electricity generation infrastructures and climate policy implemented,” he also stressed.
The study focused on the cooling demand for the residential sector, where most of it is expected to originate. “For each region, the electricity system with and without electric cooling for the residential sector in 2050 is modeled for one year with hourly time resolution,” the researchers explained.
The scientists implemented a sensitivity analysis based on different costs for solar, wind and storage to explore the uncertainties that may surround these technologies in the future. Three levels of costs — low, medium, and high — were assigned to each of the three technologies. “Varying these three parameters allows us to understand whether the cost-effectiveness of investing in solar PV due to the demand for electric cooling is undermined by expensive solar and storage, or cheap wind power,” they specified.
The selected hot-climate regions are eastern Brazil, Spain, northern Nigeria, western Saudi Arabia, South India, South China, and Malaysia. The average cost of cooling for these areas is estimated at between $24 and $52/MWh and the average electricity system cost is indicated at between $40 and $65/MWh.
Through their analysis, the scientists found that the share of solar PV in the optimal capacity mix may increase by up to 4% in eastern Brazil, up to 2% in Spain, and up to 12% in northern Nigeria. The latter is said to achieve the highest percentage thanks to the highest cooling demand share among the modeled regions.
Their findings were presented in the paper Into a cooler future with electricity generated from solar photovoltaic, published in Science. “Thanks to the long utilization time and zero running cost for solar PV, the average electricity system cost decreases when solar PV is installed to meet the increased electricity demand due to cooling. Taken together, this indicates that solar PV could be a suitable solution to sustain a comfortable indoor temperature condition in countries with hot climates,” the scientists concluded.

The first round of Germany's new tender scheme for ground-mounted PV projects has seen the allocation of 1,084 MW of solar capacity.
The procurement exercise was slightly oversubscribed, as the German authorities originally planned to allocate 1,108 MW and the German network regulator, the Federal Network Agency, agreed to review 209 project proposals with a combined capacity of 1,116 MW.
The tender concluded with a final average price of €0.0519/kWh, climbing slightly from the previous procurement round's €0.050. Bids ranged from €0.0405 to €0.055/kWh.
The southern state of Bavaria secured the largest portion of the allocated capacity — 488 MW spread across 106 projects — followed by Rhineland-Palatinate, which secured 19 projects totaling 233 MW, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania with 10 projects equaling 67 MW, and Saarland with 16 projects with a combined capacity of 66 MW.
The next round of the scheme is scheduled for June 1 and is planned to allocate around 1,200 MW of solar power.

Back in December 2021, the Northern Territory (NT) government granted Major Project Status to water-from-air technology company Aqua Aerem to develop its $15 billion 10 GW Desert Bloom green hydrogen project in Tennant Creek, NT, with ambitious plans for commercial production by 2023. Now Japanese energy giant Osaka Gas has entered into a joint development agreement that puts considerable heft behind the project.
Desert Bloom is also backed by Singapore-based Sanguine Impact Investment.
Aqua Aerem chairman and Sanguine managing director David Green has also revealed that the company is in discussions with other potential partners for the purchase of its green hydrogen, and is in the process of increasing the scale of the project to 20 GW “to meet the quickly developing demand for green hydrogen as companies position to deliver on their international commitments.”
According to Aqua Aerem (literally “water-air” in Latin), for every one kilogram of hydrogen produced, nine litres of water is required. The company’s patented proprietary technology captures water from the atmosphere in arid environments using off-grid solar energy, with no waste other than air. This commercial quantity of water can then be used in solar electrolysis whereby water is split into its constituent parts, namely hydrogen and oxygen.
Considering the scale of renewable energy required for green hydrogen production, necessarily requiring lots of sun and wind, usually hot and arid regions are best situated. Of course, such regions don’t tend to have much water. Technology that enable significant quantities of water to be obtained from the atmosphere provides a serious advantage, and are demonstrable of the increasingly fecund solar-water nexus. 
Desert Bloom aims to utilise that technology to produce green hydrogen for domestic and export markets using off-grid renewable energy generation and atmospheric water.
The joint agreement, which was ratified on Tuesday, will see the two companies develop the project, which Aqua Aerem said will produce approximately 410,000 metric tonnes of green hydrogen annually when it is completed.
Osaka Gas is no stranger to large quantities, as it is one of the world’s largest gas buyers and distributors, with a global portfolio of energy projects, pipelines and LNG terminals.
“We are pleased to be collaborating with Osaka Gas on the further development of Desert Bloom Hydrogen, which is the most advanced, shovel-ready green hydrogen project in Australia,” said Aqua Aerem CEO Gerard Reiter.
“This deal is a strong endorsement of the massive value of the project and Aqua Aerem’s innovative air-to-water technology, which is opening the door for green hydrogen projects to be located where the best renewable power sources are available, which is generally in the driest areas of the planet.”
NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner welcomed the announcement and noted that the green hydrogen sector was to play a key role in meeting the NT’s economic targets.
“Today’s announcement is great news for the Northern Territory, for Australia and for Japan, as we strive to reach our shared destination of net-zero emissions by 2050,″ said Gunner.
“This major project is also providing a big boost to our economy, with around 1,000 jobs to be created during construction and a further 120 once it is operational, and we look forward to marking many more important milestones along the way.”
The atmospheric water extraction system and hydrogen generation units are contained in multiple modular and portable solar-powered Hydrogen Production Units (HPUs) capable of generating “water, heat, electricity, and hydrogen, meaning each is a set of containerised solutions that can operate independently.” This independence garners versatility as well, and outside of green hydrogen Aqua Aerem sees potential applicability in mining and agriculture, as well as the alleviation of water scarcity.
Unlike desalination, Reiter says the advantages of generating water from air means no grid connection is required, there’s no brine to dispose of, it has fewer inefficiencies and fewer ongoing costs. Considering the water challenge is one of the biggest barriers to green hydrogen production in water-stressed regions with the best renewable resources, this technology could prove a breakthrough.
“Desert Bloom Hydrogen will produce revenue from the installation of the first module and does not require large upfront expenditure, including investment in large infrastructure that may become stranded or suffer from technological obsolesce,”  said Green. “As a result of these substantial savings, Desert Bloom will be on track to produce green hydrogen at an export price international customers want to pay – less than US$2/kg within five years.”
“An equitable global energy transition and water security are the key challenges of this generation and Aqua Aerem is well-placed to assist with the expected surging demand for reliable, affordable, green energy and provision of security water supplies.”

Arizona’s First Solar announced that it has come to terms on a multi-year master supply agreement with southern utility-scale solar developer, Silicon Ranch, under which First Solar will supply 4GW of advanced thin film photovoltaic modules to Silicon Ranch’s projects in the United States from 2023 to 2025.
While this is not the first supply partnership to be reached between the two companies, the level of commitment dramatically expands on their prior partnership, under which First Solar has supplied modules to over 30 projects totaling more than 1GW since 2015. The deal uses First Solar’s agile contracting approach, which means that Silicon Ranch will benefit from any advances in technology First Solar achieves prior to the first delivery of modules. The contract also includes a recycling clause, under which end-of-life CadTel modules from Silicon Ranch projects can be processed by First Solar’s recycling program, which recovers approximately 90% of CadTel material, allowing those materials to be used to manufacture new modules.
The move also likely alleviates some module sourcing stress for Silicon Ranch, as many developers have had their existing supply agreement plans turned upside-down by the Department of Commerce’s anti-circumvention investigation. In a webinar last week, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) shared preliminary survey data from more than 200 respondents across the solar industry. Within the survey, 75% of respondents reported that they are already experiencing canceled or delayed module shipments, while 11% have not yet been notified of delays, but expect them to come.
“Long-term module supply agreements with a trusted partner provide a vital hedge against the pricing and supply uncertainties that have impacted the solar industry over the past few years,” said Georges Antoun, chief commercial officer at First Solar. “And with First Solar’s agile contracting strategy, Silicon Ranch will have the added benefit of access to our best-in-class PV technologies as they continue to evolve.”
Silicon Ranch isn’t the only company turning to First Solar to shore up its supply. Just yesterday, Origis Energy placed an order for 750MW of First Solar’s modules.
Headquartered in Miami, Florida, Origis has completed 170 projects worldwide totaling more than 4GW to date of developed solar and energy storage capacity. The company also provides financing, engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) and operations, maintenance, and asset management.
The deal uses First Solar’s agile contracting approach, which means that Origis will benefit from any advances in technology through 2024, when the Cadmium Telluride (CadTel) thin-film modules will be delivered to its projects across the United States.
The thin-film modules to be procured by Origis are manufactured at First Solar’s R&D centers in California and Ohio. First Solar is investing $680 million in expanding America’s domestic solar manufacturing capacity by 3.3GW annually, by building its third US manufacturing facility, in Lake Township, Ohio. The new facility is expected to be commissioned in the first half of 2023 and when fully operational will bring the company’s Northwest Ohio footprint to a total annual capacity of 6GW.
