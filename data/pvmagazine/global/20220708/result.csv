The site is located 20 km north of Rome and is 50%-owned by EGP and Vulcan Energy Italy, the Italian subsidiary of the Australian lithium company. They secured a research permit from the local authorities earlier this year.
“The collaboration involves a phased approach, which in a first scoping study phase will consist of assessing the potential of Vulcan's ‘Cesano' license, a site that covers an area of 11.5 square kilometers, just a few kilometers away from Rome,” Enel said. “The partners intend to examine the prospects for further developments in geothermal lithium, starting from the area under exam but not excluding further collaborations in Italy and abroad.”
Vulcan Energy said the site hosts a single geothermal well that yields two “hot brine” samples containing high average lithium-in-brine.
“Vulcan’s in-house geological team in Germany will be collaborating with Italian geologists and local stakeholders to collate and assess historical data, verify the lithium content and assess the brine for potential lithium project development,” the company said. “If successful, the Cesano project could provide a source of strategic, sustainable lithium in Italy for Europe’s battery and automotive market, and become a possible future additive to Vulcan’s zero-carbon lithium business.”
In Germany, Vulcan Energy is working on scaling up its zero-carbon lithium project, which aims to produce geothermal energy and battery- grade lithium hydroxide by pumping geothermal brine from deep in the earth at a site in the Upper Rhine Valley. Once the heated brine has been used to produce energy, it will be processed into high-purity lithium hydroxide monohydrate at another facility.
The company has demonstrated the production of LHM exceeding minimum quality specifications for the battery industry. And in June, it secured a site outside of Frankfurt, Germany, for its planned commercial processing facility. It said it hopes to begin large-scale production at some point in 2024.

Shell‘s subsidiaries have made a final investment decision to build a renewable hydrogen plant based on a 200 MW electrolyzer in the port of Rotterdam. The plant will start operating in 2025 and will produce 60,000 kilograms of hydrogen per day. It said the plant will be the largest in Europe upon commissioning. The power for the electrolyzer will come from the Hollandse Kust offshore wind farm. The new HyTransPort pipeline will transport the hydrogen to Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam, replacing some of the refinery's gray hydrogen usage.
Vestas is launching a pilot program to determine how a hydrogen-powered crew transfer vessel (CTV) could help to reduce carbon emissions in its offshore service operations. “The CTV is powered by a dual-fuel solution, capable of being powered by hydrogen in a combination with marine gas oil,” said the Danish company. It will test the solution as part of a pilot program at the Norther Wind Farm. The launch is scheduled for July 15. and the pilot will run until the end of 2022.
Solges-Energy and the Children of Armenia Fund (COAF) have agreed to jointly launch the first complete chain of green hydrogen production in Armenia. The solar-powered industrial demonstrator will initially supply electricity to an energy center created by COAF in the village of Debet. The hydrogen will be stored or transformed back into electricity via hydrogen fuel cell, said the French company.
Air Products and power generator VPI have signed a joint development agreement for the “Humber Hydrogen Hub.” It seeks to develop an 800 MW low-carbon hydrogen production facility in Immingham, England, based on carbon capture technology and offshore CO₂ storage. The hydrogen will primarily replace gas for VPI's power production. 
Hanwha Solutions has joined Shell in a plan to build hydrogen refueling infrastructure in California. The Seoul-based company will supply Shell with high-pressure, carbon-fiber-reinforced hydrogen tanks for transport within its network of stations. The tanks, with a 2,000 liters of capacity, can store hydrogen at a pressure of 517 bar.
Tangshan, an industrial city in China, has announced plans to develop a local hydrogen energy industry. It aims to serve the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. It also wants to launch three to five advanced hydrogen companies by 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/08/smart-solar-window-based-on-thermochromic-laminate/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 8, 2022",Smart solar window based on thermochromic laminate,"A research group led by the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) has developed a new solar control window technology based on thermochromic smart glass.
The glass can change its infrared transmittance when hit by incident solar radiation as the temperature increases. It does not become visibly darker, as the effect only happens in the infrared part of the solar spectrum, so it becomes less transparent for solar heat. 
“It would be possible to combine our technology with a PV window,” researcher Paskal Buskens told pv magazine. “But depending on the PV technology you use, the wavelengths would need to be synchronized, so that the thermochromic material doesn’t block wavelengths that are used by the PV to harvest energy. Such an idea came around in some discussions, but is not actively followed up on at the moment.”
The research group used vanadium dioxide (VO2) as a functional material in the pigmented polymer film coating, as it changes its crystal structure and therefore its optical properties at high temperatures. The thermochromic coating was combined with a standard low-emission (low-E) coated glass. 
 “Thermochromics can switch their infrared modulating properties from transmissive to blocking depending on the glazing temperature,” Buskens said. “The integration of VO2  into a film or coating for application in smart thermochromic windows can lead to a significant reduction in energy consumption for heating and cooling of buildings in intermediate climate.”
The proposed solar window concept works by blocking the heat from the sun when outdoor temperatures are high, while absorbing heat in colder weather.
“VO2 changes its crystal structure at a certain temperature,” Buskens explained. “With this change in the crystal structure, also the electrical and optical properties change, which means that the material absorbs more infrared light in the high-temperature crystal phase and the absorbed solar energy is not transmitted into the building.”
In the cold temperature crystal phase, most infrared light is transmitted and can therefore enter the building. The temperature at which the material switches can be adjusted via metal ion doping and can therefore be tuned for optimum energy savings.
“The most optimum switching temperature is around 20 C,” Buskens said.
The researchers claim the smart window can ensure energy savings of up to 8% in free-standing buildings, duplexes, and terrace houses.
“For apartments with large window areas even higher energy savings of up to 30% can be reached,” they said. “In total, the thermochromic coating adds between €6.00 ($6.09) to €7.50 per square meter in cost savings to standard low-E glass, which is currently used in newly built homes. Here due to low additional production costs, a return on investment within seven years is feasible.”
According to Buskens, energy savings and annual cost savings depend on the performance of the window and the building. “Therefore, these values can vary a lot and we try to bring some consistency into the reporting,” he said.
The scientists said material and application costs for the thermochromic laminate came to between €3.00 to €5 .00 per square meter.
“The final costs for the end-user will very much depend on the glass companies selling the product,” Busken said. “But due to the low costs for the material itself and the large potential saving an attractive business case is ensured, whilst keeping the return on investment for end-users at an acceptable level of around seven years.”

The company plans to manufacture 100,000 tons of industrial silicon per year by 2023, as well as 50,000 tons of high-purity silicon. It said it also aims to produce 20 GW worth of monosilicon, while reaching 5 GW per year of wafer, cell, and module capacity. In addition, it plans to make 7.5 GW of “auxiliaries for modules” per year.  The second phase of the project, due in 2025, will add 200,000 tons of silicon production capacity, 100,000 tons of high-purity product, 25 GW of monosilicon, 7.5 GW of auxiliaries, and another 5 GW of wafers, cells, and modules.
Jolywood has begun manufacturing at its new TOPCon solar cell in Taiyuan, Shanxi province. The facility produces 182 mm and 210 mm cells and has a capacity of 16 GW per year. The company invested CNY 5.6 billion ($836 million) in the factory.
Tongwei said it expects its net profit to grow by up to 321% year on year in the first half of 2022. Net profit attributed to shareholders is estimated to be CNY 12 billion to CNY 12.5 billion. The solar cell and polysilicon manufacturer attributed its strong performance to growing sales volumes and rising polysilicon prices.
JinkoSolar has announced a share-repurchase exercise that will see it buy back up to $200 million worth of its American depository shares over a period of 18 months.
Beijing Energy International will pay two other public bodies CNY 511 million for engineering, procurement, and construction services on a 100 MW solar project in Baotou, Inner Mongolia. The contractors are local government-owned Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey and Design Institute and state-run China Energy Engineering Group Zhejiang Thermal Power Construction. Beijing Energy’s independent shareholders will vote on a proposal to spin off the project companies for a 300 MW solar project in Yulin, Shaanxi, and a 100 MW park in Hubei province. The developer wants to sell off 49% of its stake in the companies as part of a float on a Chinese stock exchange.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/08/all-perovskite-tandem-solar-panel-with-19-1-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 8, 2022",All-perovskite tandem solar panel with 19.1% efficiency,"Researchers at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany have fabricated a spin-coated, two-terminal, all-perovskite tandem solar module with an aperture area of 12.25 square centimeters and a geometric fill factor of 94.7%.
They said the laser-scribed two-terminal all-perovskite tandem (2TPT) solar cells have sparked interest at the research level in recent years, as they combine a wide bandgap perovskite top subcell with a narrow-bandgap perovskite bottom subcell.
The scientists used a 23-5% efficient 2TPT solar cell based on perovskite and copper/indium/selenium (CIS) thin-film, which they first announced in June. It has an open-circuit voltage of 1.59 V, a short-circuit current of 19.4 mA cm–2, and a fill factor of 75.5%.

The German group used a custom-built laser-scribing set-up for the production of the monolithic interconnections of the solar modules.
“The set-up allows patterning in an inert atmosphere to prevent oxygen exposure and degradation of the narrow bandgap bottom subcell during the scribing process,” they said, noting that they used vacuum-assisted growth control (VAGC) to extract all solvents in the deposition process of the bottom cell on top of the top cell.
They said the module interconnections had a minimal impact on the device's performance, which resulted in an open-circuit voltage loss of only 10 mV per cell stripe.
“Our modules retain a high fill factor of 75%, demonstrating a negligible detrimental effect of introduced module interconnections,” they said.

The solar module achieved a power conversion efficiency of 19.1% and a smaller version with an aperture area of 2.56 square centimeters reached an efficiency of 22.2%.
“The prototype module presents 95% of initial power conversion efficiency for 15-hout MPP tracking under continuous AM 1.5G illumination,” the scientists said.
They introduced the module in “Scalable two-terminal all-perovskite tandem solar modules with a 19.1% efficiency,” which was recently published in Nature Energy.
“By means of electroluminescence imaging and laser-beam-induced current mapping, we demonstrate the homogeneous current collection in both subcells over the entire module area, which explains low losses in open-circuit voltage and fill factor for our scalable modules,” they said.

Quinbrook Infrastructure has announced plans to deploy a 2,000 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) backed by large-scale wind and solar generation, as part of plans to build one of the largest “green data” storage facilities in the Southern Hemisphere.
The Supernode project will be developed in stages on a 30-hectare site in the northern Brisbane suburbs. The site will also have direct connections to an international subsea data communications network. Quinbrook Managing Partner David Scaysbrook said the site provides an “unrivaled” location for power supply resilience, offering up to 800 MW of capacity with three separate high-voltage connections.
“It also offers ample scope for powering our large-scale batteries with locally produced solar, wind and hydro sourced renewables which will also power the data centre campus as it grows,” he said.
Quinbrook plans to procure, self-develop and construct the renewables supply capacity needed by Supernode customers as their energy demands grow. It is anticipated Quinbrook will source wind power from third-party projects under development and will build new solar farms itself.

The two companies have held the same positions since 2016, with Huawei securing the top spot for the seventh year in a row. Global PV inverter shipments reachers 225,3 GWac in 2021, up 22% growth from 2021.
“Huawei’s market share stayed at a stable 23% in 2021 while Sungrow ranked a close second at about 21% growing from approximately 19% in 2020,” the analysts said. “Second runner-up Growatt accounted for 7% of market share, replacing SMA which slid down to sixth position. Together, the top three vendors control over half of the world’s solar PV inverter market.”
GoodWe jumped four positions to rank fifth  in 2021, due to large shipments to the Asia- Pacific region – particularly China and South Korea, Wood Mackenzie said. “Entering the top 10 list for the first time is Israeli-backed SolarEdge, which secured the ninth spot in 2021, adding about 1,000 MW.
The Asia-Pacific region was once again the biggest market last year, accounting for more than half of total shipments. Europe and the United States had shares of 23% and 14%, respectively.

It brought the Sessy (Smart Energy Storage System) battery to market via a crowdfunding campaign.
“The AC coupled battery can be stacked in a six-unit configuration to reach 30 kWh of storage capacity and 12 kW of power,” company co-founder Roeland Nagel told pv magazine. “It can be placed between a residential PV system's inverter and the main fuse box.”
The device measures 400 mm x 500 mm x 200 mm and weighs 45 kg. It features a nominal voltage of 48 V and is equipped with a bidirectional inverter that can be tied directly to the grid.
“The battery can be connected to Wi-Fi to get access to the cloud algorithm that provides the optimal discharge strategy to maximize savings and earnings from dynamic energy contracts,” Nagel said. “It considers solar radiation and consumption forecast, as well as electricity prices, in order to calculate the optimum time to charge and discharge.”
The roundtrip efficiency of the battery and the inverter is around 88% under full load. The product comes with a 10-year warranty and can purportedly maintain stable operations over 6.000 cycles.
“Sessy is currently being engineered and designed in the Netherlands,” Nagel said. “The production will also be done in The Netherlands in the facility of Charged in Aldelst, in the province of Gelderland, Netherlands.”
Charged plans to raise capital via funding rounds under the SmartHub Incubator Industry platform.

The “energy centers” it has identified already host turbines. It said it will also add battery storage and hydrogen production facilities, with the additional possibility of hydrogen refining and biogas equipment.
The company said it has lodged a planning application for 700 hectares of land to host solar panels at the Energipark Overgaard in Randers municipality, where it has 26 wind turbines. That site is Denmark's largest onshore wind farm, according to Eurowind.
Based on prices in Germany in 2020, 700 hectares could host around 630 MW of solar generating capacity. Another 375 hectares has been secured from landowners for solar at the developer's Energipark in Aalborg. The company said it has also proposed a solar element in its plans for the Nørrekær Enge II site in Vesthimmerland.
“Solar PV and wind turbines will always be the starting point for us,” said CEO Jens Rasmussen. “They produce the green power that is used in the other parts of the energy center. That part is in place. We are also working with battery technology because this way we can provide balance services to the electricity grid. We have already tested batteries and will perform several tests at our plant at Greenlab Skive.”
Eurowind also quoted Rasmussen as saying that the company sees “electrolysis as part of all [its] energy centers and [its] medium-sized energy parks.” The company also claims to be “relatively advanced” at making power-to-X technologies a part of the project.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/08/teslas-solar-trailer-for-range-extension/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 8, 2022",Tesla’s solar trailer for range extension,"From pv magazine USA
Tesla has unveiled a new concept solar trailer for range extension at the IdeenExpo in Hanover, Germany. The trailer features a fold-out array of nine solar panels and the SpaceX Starlink satellite internet system.
The trailer reportedly can produce about 50 miles of additional electric vehicle range, assuming the modules pictured are about 300 W each. This brings the array capacity to approximately 2.7 kW.
The average US driver covers about 39 miles a day on their daily commute, so the trailer might represent a useful alternative to home charging. Tesla has yet to say whether the prototype will go into mass production.
The trailer also features SpaceX’s Starlink, a satellite-based internet hub that offers high-speed, low-latency broadband internet in remote and rural locations by connecting to a SpaceX Starlink satellite in orbit. Starlink is currently offered for residential and RV applications for an initial hardware cost of about $600, plus $110 to $135 per month for ongoing service.
Solar trailer models have continued to pop up across the globe, designed for various applications. In Munich, Sono Motors recently said it plans to equip the city’s fleet of buses with trailers topped with 20 semi-flexible solar panels.
The modules cover an area of 12 square meters and supply the 24 V battery with more than 2,000 W. In this pilot, the solar energy generated will be used to operate the HVAC system and to support the trailer steering system. This saves the bus from burning diesel and stabilizes the battery’s energy supply, which lowers maintenance costs and extends battery lifecycle.
The company said a medium-sized fleet of 300 buses could save about 2,000 metric tons of C02 emissions each year. When considering the 1.5 ton C02 emissions “backpack,” or the amount of emissions related to producing the bus trailer, the carbon impact of production would be offset in less than one year of operation.
In Spain, startup Polar Developments created a retractable compact trailer that houses 12 solar panels with a total capacity of 4.4 kW. The system is scalable and can reach a capacity of up to 6.5  kW.
It can be used to provide energy for cars, scooters or electric bikes. It can also provide energy support to homes during power outages, among other uses. The PolarGreen Tow trailer can be transformed into “an authentic removable solar micro farm” in less than an hour.
