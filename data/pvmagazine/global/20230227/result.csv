COO Thomas Hausch is also stepping down from his role.
The company’s decision to end the Sion program appears to be driven by the high cost of its business plan, coupled with “depressed capital market conditions.” Sono Motors said an estimated 90% of its funding needs for 2023 were dedicated to the solar car program.
Sono Motors first publicly presented its plans for the Sion solar electric car in 2017. The Sion was marketed as the world’s first affordable solar EV, with a price tag of about €25,000 ($26,375).
Sion’s outer shell featured 456 monocrystalline solar half cells to extend the time between charges and enable self-sufficiency on short journeys. Its 54 kWh lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) battery would allow for a maximum charging capacity of up to 75 kW (DC) and 11 kW (AC). The vehicle also had an 11 kW, on-board bidirectional charger.
However, pre-series production of the Sion remained beyond reach, as Sono Motors has repeatedly failed to secure enough funding. In December, it launched the #savesion campaign to offer customers €3,000 discounts in exchange for advance payments. It aimed to secure €100 million.
Sono’s plan was to start production of the Sion car in Finland in the second half of 2023. However, “given the resource-intensive nature of the Sion program, including personnel requirements, the company is now implementing a significant cost reduction program,” it said in a statement.
“It was a difficult decision and despite more than 45,000 reservations and pre-orders for the Sion, we were compelled to react to the ongoing financial market instability and streamline our business,” said Laurin Hahn, the CEO of Sono Motors.
“In terms of Sion reservations with deposits made before the #savesion campaign, the company announced a payback plan to reimburse in various instalments including a bonus over the next two years,” Sono said in a statement without providing any further details of the plan.
The company said the success of its 18-vehicle series-validation program proved the viability of its solar electric vehicle concept. This is why it will continue to use its proprietary polymer-based vehicle-integrated solar technology, but only by retrofitting and integrating the tech into third-party vehicles.
Sono now plans to sell its Sion program. In addition to the passenger car program, the company has worked on PV solutions for buses, e-vans, and refrigerated vehicles. It will launch its Solar Bus Kit retrofit solution in the second half of 2023, the company said on Friday.
To date, Sono has acquired 23 customers, including Mitsubishi Europe, CHEREAU and Volkswagen subsidiaries – Scania and MAN Truck & Bus, which are piloting its integrated solar technology in a variety of vehicles.

“Our solution uses a bio-inspired coconut fiber for thermal regulation,” researcher Sudhakar Kumarasamy told pv magazine. “It can be used for building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) rooftop systems, ground-mounted plants and agrivoltaics.”
The researchers described their findings in “Thermal and Electrical Performance of Uncooled, Nature-Cooled, and Photovoltaic Thermal Module,” which was recently published in the International Journal of Photoenergy. They said that the cooling system features a moist coconut pith encapsulated with a polyurethane sheet. It is placed on the back of surface of a PV module to act as a heat sink.
“Water molecules are directly in contact with the PV modules’ back surface with the coconut fiber’s help due to the coconut fiber’s high water-holding capacity, lowering the back surface temperature of the module,” the scientists said, noting that this helps to transfer heat from the front to the back surface via conduction. “Following this, the sensible heat will be absorbed by the water molecules present in the coconut fiber. Finally, when the water molecules have absorbed sufficient heat energy, they will act as a heat removal agent by evaporating through the perforations present on the polyethylene sheet encapsulation.”
The researchers compared the temperature behavior and performance of a PV module equipped with the system to that of a photovoltaic-thermal module (PVT) with water-based cooling.  They found that the passively cooled PV module had a maximum operational temperature of 44.6 C, while the PVT panel and a reference PV panel without cooling registered higher temperatures of 47.8 C, and 57.2 C, respectively.
“By integrating damp coconut, the temperature of the PV module surface was decreased by 22.03% and 23.46%, whereas the PVT system reduced the PV module surface temperature by 16.43%,” the scientists explained. “The maximum power point (MPP) for the passively cooled PV module with coconut fiber, PVT system, and reference module is 24.21 W, 20.21 W, and 14.65 W, respectively.”
They said that the passively cooled PV module's power output increased by 65.26%.
“The PVT system, however, only managed to increase the power output by 37.95%,” the said. “The convection that carries water molecules away from the back of the PV module increases heat loss from the back surface and, as a result, from the front cover of the passively cooled PV module compared to the PVT system.”
The same research group also published an extensive review of all passive and cooling techniques applied to photovoltaics in October 2021. The study looked at active techniques such as air-based cooling, liquid-based cooling, forced water circulation, liquid immersion cooling, water spraying. The also considered passive methods like PCM cooling, heat pipes, heat sink or fins and heat exchangers, microchannel heat exchangers, radiative sky cooling, nano-fluid based cooling, thermoelectric cooling, evaporative cooling, and spectrum filter cooling.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/27/new-thermal-battery-offers-fast-efficient-performance-at-low-cost/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HEAT PUMPS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,PENNSYLVANIA,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"FEBRUARY 27, 2023","New thermal battery offers fast, efficient performance at low cost","Thermal energy storage systems use temperature shifts to store energy for later use, or for use at other locations. The most commonly used ways to capture energy are based on latent and sensible heat transfers.
The former heat method uses the amount of thermal energy needed for a phase change – which is a change in physical state, such as from solid to liquid, or liquid to gas – without altering the temperature of a material. This technique is associated with large energy densities. The latter is the thermal energy required to raise the temperature of a material without causing any phase transitions. A major advantage of this heat transfer method is its low cost.
Now, engineers at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, with support from the US Department of Energy, have developed a new thermal energy system that combines the best of both techniques. The Lehigh Thermal Battery consists of engineered cementitious materials and thermosiphons in a combination that enables fast, efficient thermal performance at low cost. The technology can operate with heat or electricity as the charging energy input.
The team has announced that, after three years of research and development, the Lehigh Thermal Battery is now market-ready. The process involved integrated system testing at 3, 10 and 150 kilowatt-hours thermal (kWhth) in a relevant environment.
The 150-kWhth prototype built at the Energy Research Center is a fully instrumented structure containing 22 finned thermosyphons. The 150-kWhth prototype has been tested extensively using compressed air at 480 C, producing an energy-to-energy charge/discharge efficiency of the solid media of more than 95%, uniform temperature distribution in the solid media during charging, and consistent cyclic repeatability.
The average power rates achieved during charging and discharging were 16.4 kWth and 19.8 kWth, respectively, with a very fast energy gradient of the thermal battery of 0.51 kWhth/min during the first hour of discharge.
Co-principal investigator Sudhakar Neti, professor emeritus in the Department of Mechanics and Mechanical Engineering at Lehigh, claimed that the technology is innovative on many levels.
“It is modular, designed for independent energy input/output streams during charging/discharging, which is feasible with the help of the thermosyphons, and the two-phase change process inside the thermosyphon tubes allows rapid isothermal heat transfer to/from the storage media at very high heat transfer coefficients and heat rates,” said Neti.
Carlos Romero, co-principal investigator on the project and the director of the Energy Research Center at Lehigh, said that the concrete plus thermosiphon concept is unique among heat energy storage concepts.
“The technology offers the potential for adaptation over a broad range of temperatures, and heat transfer media and operating conditions,” said Romero.
These qualities make the Lehigh Thermal Battery suitable for decarbonization opportunities in energy-intense industry sectors, the flexibilization of conventional power plants, and advancements and penetration of concentrated solar power.
“Another opportunity for the Lehigh Thermal Battery to play an important role in the decarbonization effort is the integration of thermal energy storage in a system that includes heat pumps and Organic Rankine Cycles, working with surplus renewable electricity,” said Neti.

It exhibited the new product at the Genera trade show last week in Madrid, Spain.
The Chinese energy storage specialist said one to five battery modules can be connected in series, with capacities ranging from 3.74 kWh to 18.7 kWh. The smallest battery in the Titan-HV battery line has a nominal voltage of 96 V, measures 606 mm x 651 mm x 217 mm, and weighs 49.5 kg. The largest has a nominal voltage of 480 V, measures 1,910 mm x 651 mm x 217 mm, and weighs 198.7 kg.
“The GS Energy Titan-HV series is a high-voltage, expandable battery energy storage system. It is easy to install and can be plugged in and used immediately,” said GS Energy.
The new battery can be placed on the ground and can be installed indoors or outdoors. It discharges ambient temperatures ranging between -10 C and 50 C, and charges at temperatures between 0 C and 40 C. It comes with a 10-year warranty and reportedly has a lifecycle of more than 6,000 cycles.
The new product is IP65-rated and has been approved according to UN 38.3, IEC 62619, and IEC 62040 certifications.

Individuals who install new, unused rooftop solar panels from March 1, 2023, will be able to claim rebates equal to 25% of the cost of the panels, up to a maximum of ZAR 15,000.
The new scheme has a budget of ZAR 4 billion and was introduced to address South Africa’s severe load-shedding problems.
“Record levels of load shedding were experienced in 2022 – 207 days of load shedding compared to 75 days in 2021,” the minister said in his budget speech last Thursday. “In response, we are acting decisively to bring additional capacity onto the grid.”
The rebate scheme only covers PV modules with minimum capacities of 275 W. Portable solar panels are excluded. The solar modules must be part of systems connected to the main distribution of private residences. The rebate applies to qualifying solar PV panels that are brought into use for the first time in the period between March 1, 2023, and Feb. 29, 2024.
Storage systems, inverters, diesel generators, and installation costs will not be covered by the program. The South African Photovoltaic Industry Association (SAPVIA) has already criticized this decision.
“Solar panels alone do not protect end users against loadshedding,” said SAPVIA CEO Rethabile Melamu. “The solar panels incentive is limited and does not address those households that can't access instruments for the purchase of solar systems. Based on a 25% cap this could translate to a solar system of ZAR 60,000 [6 kWp to 7 kWp] which will not make a meaningful impact for the average household without storage,” he argued. “SAPVIA is on record indicating that an average household tends to purchase a 5 kW hybrid system, including panels and battery storage which ranges from ZAR 95,000 to ZAR 200,000 depending on the components used.”
Melamu said SAPVIA welcomes the incentive scheme, but it is urging the government to consult with its experts to design such programs more effectively. However, the government has also announced the expansion of its renewable energy tax incentive for businesses, with a total budget of ZAR 5 billion. From March 1, 2023, businesses will be able to reduce their taxable income by 125% of the cost of an investment in renewables.
“There will be no thresholds on the size of the projects that qualify, and the incentive will be available for two years to stimulate investment in the short term,” said Godongwana.
The current scheme allows businesses to deduct 50% of their renewable investments in the first year, 30% in the second, and 20% in the third year. This applies to PV projects above 1 MW in size, along with qualifying investments in wind energy, concentrated solar, hydropower, and biomass. Investors in PV projects below 1 MW in size can deduct 100% of their costs in the first year.
Under the expanded tax incentives, businesses will be able to claim a 125% deduction in the first year without thresholds on the size of projects.

They claim it can predict electricity generation levels one hour ahead.
They described their findings in “Individual yield nowcasting for residential PV systems,” which was recently published in Solar Energy. The researchers said the new approach can forecast the individual power output of large fleets of PV systems. 
Their novel method is based on a single XGBoost algorithm, which is a decision-tree ensemble, open-access algorithm that uses a gradient-boosting framework.
“Since XGBoost is made of a combination of decision trees, the importance of each feature is relatively straightforward to compute,” the researchers said. “A decision tree makes predictions by splitting decisions into branches.”
They applied the algorithm to a fleet of 1,102 residential PV systems in the Netherlands and Belgium. They considered global horizontal irradiance (GHI), cloud coverage, wind speed, precipitation, and ambient temperature, by relying on data provided by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.
Their methodology also considers PV system size, age, panel types, latitude, longitude, panel inclination, orientation, decay-per-year inverter efficiency, and operational cell temperatures.
“Descriptive parameters consist of day of year and historical yield from 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h before,” the academics said, noting that Dutch startup Solar Monkey provided all of the system data. “Data needs to be properly prepared for the machine learning model in order to obtain the best results.”
Given an average PV system size of 4.4 kW, the algorithm achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.877 kWh and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 23% for hourly data aggregated to daily values.
“XGBoost predictions for individual PV systems are on average two times better than currently used commercial software,” the academics said. “Despite the presented issues, XGBoost provides two fold improvement with respect to the commercially available analytical model.”
