THEnergy recently published an electrolysis capacity map for Europe. “My best guess would be that the map covers 80% of electrolyzers that are used for producing green hydrogen,” said Hillig. “Adding up the installations from the map results in approximately 135 MW. So, the total would be in the range of 170 MW.” He noted that a big wave of new electrolyzers emerged in 2023. “However, many projects are still under realization,” he said. “That also means that the map will look completely different in one year from now.”
Ecoclean has started series production of modular AEL electrolyzers on a megawatt scale. “The robust, low-maintenance electrolyzers from the globally active company are available as scalable standalone solutions and turnkey systems with outputs ranging from 1 to 20 MW,” said the German company. It claimed the systems deliver “high gas quality” and a system pressure of up to 30 bars. “As not every application requires a gas pressure of 30 bars or more, [we are] currently in the process of adding atmospheric-pressure alkaline electrolyzers to [our] product range,” said Ecoclean.
Lhyfe and EDP Renewables have signed a 15-year renewable electricity supply contract. Under their corporate power purchase agreement (CPPA), Lhyfe will buy energy from a 55 MW solar project in Germany developed by EDPR, through Kronos Solar EDPR. The companies expect to connect the installation to the grid during 2025. The CPPA is Lhyfe's largest such deal to date and secures renewable power supplies for its future green hydrogen production sites in Germany. It is also the first PPA that EDP Renewables has signed with a hydrogen company.
Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe has launched a public tender for the procurement of up to 151,000 tons of low-carbon hydrogen, in order to supply direct-iron reduction facilities it is building at its plant in Duisburg, Germany. The steelmaker is seeking 10-year contracts for green or blue H2 to reduce emissions at Germany's largest steel mill.
Masdar and Daimler Truck have agreed to explore the feasibility of liquid green hydrogen exports from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, to Europe by 2030. The aim is to decarbonize road freight transport in the continent. Daimler Truck is pursuing a dual-track strategy with hydrogen- and battery-powered vehicles. The company's prototype Mercedes-Benz GenH2 Truck recently completed a trip of 1,047 kilometers across Germany with one fill of liquid hydrogen under real-life conditions. Daimler Truck is building a customer-trial fleet of Mercedes-Benz GenH2 Trucks, which is expected to be deployed in mid-2024.
Germany's National Academy of Science and Engineering has concluded that a feasible German-Australian supply chain exists, as outlined in a new study it has commissioned. The Fraunhofer Research Institution for Energy Infrastructures and Geothermal Energy IEG conducted the study, comparing the economic benefits and technical feasibility of various transport infrastructures, including a hydrogen network, product pipeline, inland waterway vessel, and rail. Acatech President Jan Wörner said that an Australian-German hydrogen bridge promises a stable and mutually beneficial trade relationship between two democratic countries. The study is the final component of the HySupply project, initiated in December 2020 and funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), conducted in collaboration with an Australian consortium led by the University of New South Wales in Sydney (UNSW).
Edison Energy said numerous companies signed green hydrogen deals in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2023, supporting new production facilities. The clarity brought by EU regulations and support mechanisms, including the EU Hydrogen Bank for operating expenses, could spur competition for power purchase agreements (PPAs) if European hydrogen producers successfully address economic and technical obstacles in deploying renewable hydrogen production facilities. Edison Energy said that PPA pricing continued to fall in the fourth quarter across most markets, with Polish and Italian median prices decreasing by 16% and 12%, respectively, compared to the third quarter. In Germany and Spain, fourth-quarter PPA prices remained relatively unchanged from the third quarter, with a shift of around €2 ($2.17)/MWh. Median prices in these countries also fell compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 as volatility eased, it said.

The company said in a statement that it is evaluating the development of multi-gigawatt-scale solar wafer manufacturing in the US market, with an initial target production volume of 6 GW.
The company said it is evaluating manufacturing locations, considering regional incentives, and actively working on strategic partnerships and wafer offtake agreements in the United States.
To lead the US operation, the company has named Jonathan Pickering as VP of business development, North America. He was previously an executive at JA Solar Americas and Applied Materials.
“Multiple top-tier solar companies have committed to advanced PV cell and module manufacturing at a multi-gigawatt scale across the US. But now we see a significant bottleneck in the supply chain for a domestic source of silicon wafers,” said Pickering, adding that the company will be able to offer US-made, thin silicon wafers.
Nexwafe is commercializing kerfless wafers. Its monocrystalline silicon wafers are grown directly in a gas-to-wafer manufacturing process that it claims is not only more efficient but also enables the production of ultra-thin wafers. Its wafers are compatible with conventional cell processing, and reportedly minimize wastage, offering a 60% reduction in the carbon footprint compared to conventional processes.
Nexwafe, which is based in Freiburg, Germany, announced a €30 million financing round in May 2023.

The move is part of the company's plan to expand across the entire PV supply chain. In April 2023, the silicon and polysilicon producer announced plans to build a 20 GW vertically integrated module factory in Urumqi.
Flat Glass Group said it has paid HKD 59.67 million ($7.63 million) to buy back 4.26 million of its H shares, as part of a board-authorized share repurchase program.
Golden Solar New Energy Technology acquired 1,296,000 of its shares between Dec. 19, 2023, and Jan. 22, 2024. The transaction was part of a previously announced share buyback program. It said it has spent HKD 5.09 million on 1.37 million shares thus far.

They have found that hybridizing CSP facilities with PV projects could offer the best cost-competitive configuration.
The scientists said that the two cities have different weather and irradiance conditions. The scientists see “solar multiple,” which is the ratio of solar field thermal capacity to power block capacity, as the crucial factor.
“The study presents a new way of thinking about the potential of CSP plants not only to provide baseload generation, but to act as more flexible generation assets taking a combination of direct solar heat and excess electricity from PV or wind plants that would otherwise be curtailed, and delivering baseload power for a 100% renewable future,” they explained.
The December-January edition of pv magazine reveals the much-anticipated winners of this year’s pv magazine Awards. We also consider the ramifications of the current global oversupply of solar panels, Australia’s prospects for refining battery raw materials, and progress with the European Union’s green hydrogen ambitions.
The researchers explained their findings in “Integrated CSP-PV hybrid solar power plant for two cities in Saudi Arabia,” which was recently published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering. They presented the results of three different simulations conducted via the NREL System Advisor Model (SAM) model and covered three types of projects.
The scientists that all of their PV project configurations use AC power after the inverter as input.
“All simulations were performed using a typical meteorological year (TMY) time series for the meteorological variables including direct and global irradiance components, temperature, and wind speed,” they said. “The hybrid concept with a PV plant added to the CSP original baseload plant, the results show a reduction in LCOE of 18% for Riyadh and 7% for Tabuk keeping the plant capacity factor at a high 79%. The hybridization concept can extend the applicability of CSP technology to regions with less direct sunlight than would be economically feasible with CSP alone.”
Another recent study from Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd University showed that Saudi Arabia’s futuristic Neom City would use the sources of renewable energy that have the best chances of being dispatched.
“There will be no competition between the different renewable energy technologies and synergies will be the key,” researcher Alberto Boretti told pv magazine.
CSP, which Boretti defined as the only renewable energy source with the added value of dispatchability, will prevail over PV and wind, as it relies on internal molten salt energy storage, so it doesn't need external solutions for storage.
The Neom City project is part of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's efforts to shift to a less oil-dependent economy.

Saudi Arabia’s traditional power grid faces challenges such as transmission losses, low efficiency, and limited ability to accommodate renewable energy sources, creating the need for a modernized smart grid.
The researchers said smart grids increase the potential of integrating renewables into the electricity grid by allowing better energy transactions and reliable supply. They claimed that utilities would be better equipped to deal with load-balancing challenges associated with renewable integration. The researchers also said that smart grids could “help reduce greenhouse gas emissions through optimized operational accessibility of grid assets with enhanced reliability, self-healing capability, and resilience incorporated into the grid system, leading to better energy management opportunities.”
They listed a series of other benefits outside of renewables potential, including allowing for better protection against cyberattacks, reducing system losses and energy waste, as well as reducing the need for redundant or new power plants and transmission lines, while also enabling predictive maintenance. But the researchers said the deployment of smart grids must be well organized and meticulously planned.
“Even though smart grid proves to be a promising technology, a meticulous blueprint is needed to be designed to ensure an advanced projection for initiation, planning, development, and execution for a practical and satisfactory realization,” they said.
They noted that the promotion of smart grid technologies will be needed for consumers to buy into the idea. They recommended regulatory governance to ensure the security and privacy of smart grid technologies.

The scheme, first presented by Cyprus’ minister of energy, commerce and industry in November, has a budget of €30 million ($32.4 million) and is expected to help around 6,000 homes.
It features three for photovoltaics.
The general photovoltaic category offers a grant of €375 per kW and a maximum grant of €1,500 (4kW), with a 50% increase for mountainous areas. The second photovoltaic category, aimed at vulnerable households, offers a grant of €1,250 per kW and a maximum grant of €6,250 (5kW). 
A third photovoltaic category, entitled ‘photovoltaics for all’, offers the possibility of installing a photovoltaic system for citizens who do not have the initial capital. It will give a grant of €250 per kW and a maximum grant amount of €1,000 (4kW), as well as an additional investment repayment of €1,000 per kW with a maximum repayment amount of €4,000.
The scheme is also offering a one-off bonus of €750 if both PV and roof insulation are implemented in the same house.
Applicants will be pre-approved before installation, with applications processed electronically to reduce bureaucracy and speed up the payment of the grant. Repayments start with bi-monthly charges of €150 through the household's electricity bill.
Installations must be carried out by installers registered in a list of participating traders, providing applicants with a seven-year commercial guarantee. Installers of photovoltaics and roof insulation are expected to begin registration in the coming days. 
The scheme is expected to open for applications by the end of February.
Statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) show that Cyprus had 464 MW of cumulative solar installations at the end of 2022.

6,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/26/april-total-eclipse-to-impact-solar-generation-from-mexico-to-new-england/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,2024-01-26,April total eclipse to impact solar generation from Mexico to New England,"As solar capacity increases, the grid impact of subsequent major solar events also increases. On April 8, a total eclipse will pass from Mexico, across Texas and up the East Coast, with most of the continental US experiencing a significant drop in solar generation. The eclipse will occur from Noon to the early afternoon, when solar generation is at its highest. It is too early to predict weather conditions for the day, in particular high-resolution cloud modeling, so this analysis is based on clearsky data via the Solcast API.

 
Areas in the totality, where the moon completely blocks the sun, will see a 100% loss in solar generation for the duration of the totality. However, the overall effects of the eclipse will cost up to 16% of daily total clear sky irradiance in areas most affected.
 
 

Whilst it is too early to predict the precise cloud impacts on the day, Grid Operators will already be preparing for the maximum potential impact, a temporary total loss of solar generation and a fast ramp of solar decreasing then increasing. For areas directly in the path of the eclipse, the maximum duration will be over 90 minutes of impacted generation, and a total loss of up to 6 minutes. In every grid analyzed, the rate at which solar generation drops off and then picks back up again, is faster than grids normally see in the morning and evening.

Due to the large proportion of utility scale assets in ERCOT, Texas will be heavily impacted by the effects of the eclipse. Individual assets will lose up to 16% of their daily irradiance, but the wide area covered by ERCOT means that the overall loss to the grid will be up to 11.7% of daily utility scale solar generation. At current capacity, that would be 16.9 GWh, though the rapid increase in capacity in ERCOT, and known projects coming online before April makes it likely this number could be higher. Solcast’s grid aggregation model shows that the ramp will be slightly steeper than normally seen in the morning or evening, peaking at a rate of 250 MW/minute. The fast change in generation is what can cause instability in the grid, so asset managers, energy traders and grid operators will be working to maintain stability whilst making the most of volatile energy prices.


As the eclipse moves up the East Coast, it will impact both NYISO and ISO-NE. These regions have less utility scale solar than Texas, so the impact will mostly be seen in ‘behind-the-meter’ residential rooftop solar generation. For each grid, the impacts are fairly similar. NYISO will lose up to 10.91% of their daily rooftop generation, and up to 3.1 GWh of power. Being further south, and hit by the eclipse slightly earlier explains the difference with ISO-NE. New England will lose up to 9.85% of its daily behind-the-meter generation, though differences in installed capacity make this a higher 3.7 GWh. Notably the ramp rate is much higher than the morning or afternoon ramps, as irradiance will drop from almost the daily maximum to zero in approximately 40 minutes. This will require active management from the grid operators to maintain stability.

CAISO in California will also see impacts from this eclipse, though being so far from the path of totality, the effects will be less than seen in the partial annular eclipse in September 2023. Despite seeing a lower proportional effect from grids in the North-East, only 5.72% of daily
generation, increased levels of rooftop solar in California mean that the energy losses will be greater than either NYISO or ISO-NE, up to 4.0 GWh.
Whilst the impact of this eclipse is significant, it is predictable, and grid operators are already preparing and planning for the impacts. Large storm events, snow dump events and large heavy cloud fronts are less spectacular but can have even bigger impacts on whole-day solar generation. These events are also harder to plan for and predict, which makes it more important for asset owners and grid operators to plan and manage the impact of weather on solar generation as solar increases in the generation mix.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This information is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets throughout the world.

The researchers carried out a supply chain analysis on heating households using hydrogen-source heat pumps compared to heat pump systems utilizing air, ground and water as their energy source. The researchers, from the Advanced Resource Efficiency Centre at the University of Sheffield, believe it is the first study to consider hydrogen as an energy source for heat pumps.
Their findings indicate that hydrogen-based heat pumps, which operate using green hydrogen derived from renewable energy sources instead of relying on electricity from the grid network, present a “promising option” for the UK market. They have the potential to reduce stress on the national grid network and minimize the environmental impacts associated with the supply chain. Hydrogen's abundant availability, minimal emissions, significant reduced greenhouse gases and reversible generation process were noted as key benefits.
Central heating operated by natural-gas-fueled boilers is currently the dominant heating system in UK households. Households in the UK have experienced recent surges in energy prices and the issue of pollution and dependency on fossil fuels in existing boilers pose significant threats to the sustainability, energy security, and resilience of the UK's building sector.
The UK government has set a nationwide goal to eliminate fossil fuel-based heating systems from new residential constructions by 2026. In its Heat and Buildings Strategy, the government set a goal of a minimum of 600,000 heat pump installations annually by 2028. The strategy acknowledges the potential contribution of hydrogen in the decarbonisation of heat, suggesting hydrogen could cater to up to 4 million households by 2035.
The research paper says the heat pump market and its supply chain “will play a significant role in shaping the energy security and resilience of the United Kingdom.” The researchers said they hope the results of the project will help policymakers and other stakeholders select more environmentally-friendly supply chain pathways for heat pumps, enhancing the resilience of the UK’s energy supply.
“This research highlights the potential of a net-zero emissions strategy for heat pumps in mitigating ecological impacts, attracting investment, gaining support from local authorities, and influencing decision-makers to allocate more financial resources for the expansion of renewable energy sources and their integration into the grid network,” said Prof Lenny Koh, director of advanced resource efficiency at the University of Sheffield and co-head of Energy Institute.
The research paper’s conclusion says the United Kingdom exhibits substantial potential for manufacturing and advancing hydrogen production systems domestically. It suggests the heat pump supply chain, and the supply chain for hydrogen production technologies such as electrolysis, are strengthened in parallel in the United Kingdom. It also calls for manufacturing capacity development to supply all main components of heat pump units in the United Kingdom, including compressors, evaporators, valves, piping, insulation, and refrigerants.
“The outcomes of this study could also help policymakers choose more sustainable supply chain scenarios and routes to counter climate change, reduce toxicology and global warming damaging consequences,” the researchers concluded. “Such actions to improve UK energy sustainability, resiliency and security are poised to have substantial direct and indirect benefits on a wide range of industries and sectors.”

“Everything electric happens behind the curtains: the contacts are placed on the back of the module, thus allowing a ‘gridless' effect,” Conny Axel Hulverscheidt, the CTO of AGE's Solar Solutions Group, told pv magazine, referring to the cell design. “Not only does this allow a larger active area on the module surface to convert sunlight to electricity, it also ensures an absolute sleek black look. Furthermore, the low-temperature coefficients and the robust dual glass design make this solar module a real flagship product.”
The AS-M1089B-GA(M10)/HV solar panel is currently available in three versions with a power output of 445 W to 455 W. Power conversion efficiencies range from 22.8% to 23,3%, while the open-circuit voltage is between 40.15 V and 40.35 V and the short-circuit current spans from 13.68 A to 13.80 A.
The panel is based on M10 wafers, measures 1,722 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm, and weighs in at 24.0 kg. It relies on 2.0 mm glass, a black frame made of anodized aluminum alloy, and an IP68 rating. It can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and temperatures ranging from -40 C to 85 C. It features a temperature coefficient of -0.29% per degree Celsius.
AEG offers a 40-year product warranty and a 40-year power output guarantee. The 40-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 83.4% of the nominal output power.
“To underline the premium approach, this module design gives us the confidence to offer market-leading warranties of up to 40 years,” Hulverscheidt stated. “The series will soon also include a 460 W version and will be available in two variants: a glass-glass product and a glass-backsheet module. Both panels with have a 108-cell design.”

California, once known as a clean energy leader, has fallen off track with its clean energy goals. This is the view that was shared last week by CALSSA in a panel discussion at the Intersolar North America conference in San Diego, California.
The US state passed a bill in 2018 targeting 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. Governor Gavin Newsom recently set an interim target of 90% carbon-free electricity by 2035, accelerating the clock for deployment.
When considering the state’s ambitious goals for whole home electrification and the halt of new gas-powered car sales by 2035, electricity demand is only expected to rise sharply, making these goals even more ambitious.
The California Energy Commission (CEC) projects that the state will need to build 6 GW of solar-plus-storage every year for the next 26 years straight to meet the 2045 target. Over the past five years, California has only averaged about half of the 6 GW deployment figure.
“We started to get on pace in the past two years, but it is driven at least 50% by the distributed [rooftop solar] market,” said CALSSA Executive Director Bernadette del Chiaro.
On this march toward 100% carbon-free power, California shot itself in the foot, passing Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0, a policy that cut customer compensation for exporting power to the grid. Combined with a high interest rate environment, project economics for rooftop solar in California have eroded, and demand has imploded.
CALSSA reports that roughly 17,000 rooftop solar jobs have been lost, demand for rooftop solar has fallen about 80%, and solar business insurer Solar Insure said that 75% of its covered companies are considered a “high risk” for bankruptcy.

10,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/26/mixed-signals-for-solar-cell-price-prospects/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,2024-01-26,Mixed signals for solar cell price prospects,"Solar cell FOB China prices have stayed consistent this week since there hasn't been much of a shift in supply and demand fundamentals. Mono PERC M10 and G12 cell prices trended flat at $0.0482/W and $0.0473/W, respectively while the TOPCon M10 cell price remained flat at $0.0584/W week on week.
Mono PERC M10 cells on the Chinese domestic market remained at CNY0.387 ($0.055)/W, according to the OPIS survey. A portion of the price stability can be attributed to the upstream wafer prices stabilizing after ceasing to rise. The price of Mono PERC M10 wafers on the Chinese domestic market trended flat this week as a result of wafer producers' attempts to boost pricing and restore profits being derailed by the weak demand, staying at CNY1.98/pc without any change from last week.

Nevertheless, cell suppliers are still attempting to invent fresh price hikes. According to a source from the cell segment, it is optimistic that the price may rise to over CNY0.4/pc by early February.
According to this source, market participants believe that Mono PERC M10 cell prices are at their lowest point for the foreseeable future, because such cells are poised to move from being mass-market products to customized products. “Manufactures don’t have to sell bespoke items at large losses,” the source added.
By contrast, a downstream source is cautious about additional Mono PERC cell pricing hikes before Chinese New Year, arguing that there isn't sufficient demand to support the price increases. “The majority of new module purchase orders signed by European developers beginning in the second half of 2023 are n-type,” the source continued.
A developer concurred, stating that it may be difficult for all types of cells to raise prices in February and that the module businesses' cash flow might not be able to support the price hikes of cells.
Even after switching to n-type cells, another cell supplier claimed that the manufacturers’ financial status has not significantly improved. The source stated that non-silicon costs like silver paste are the main reason why creating n-type cells is more expensive than producing Mono PERC cells. The market participant went on to say that N-type cells' premium price is insufficient to cover these expenses, though the price of TOPCon M10 cells is between CNY0.08/W and CNY0.09/wp or about 21% higher than that of Mono PERC M10 cells.
Product diversification remains a key strategy for cell companies seeking to stay in business. A medium-sized cell producer told OPIS that they plan to start the production of TOPCon M10 cells with 16-busbar in 2024, which are more effective than conventional 10-busbar cells and require less silver paste.

11,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/26/ai-tech-for-dc-arc-detection-in-pv-systems/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,QUALITY,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,ASIA,CHINA",LIOR KAHANA,2024-01-26,AI tech for DC arc detection in PV systems,"Researchers from China's Tianjin University and inverter manufacturer Ginlong Solis have developed a novel AI-based method for DC arc detection in PV systems.
A DC arc occurs in PV arrays when there is an electrical discharge between conductive parts on this side of the system. The high energy and temperature involved in the process ionize surrounding gases, creating a plasma path for the current to continue flowing. “PV DC arc-faults have the potential to start fires, damage property, and endanger people's lives,” the group stated. “Many countries have established DC arc detection standards and defined DC arc fault protection due to the disastrous consequences of DC arcs.”
The novel technique is based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm and the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) machine learning estimation method. The FFT is an algorithm frequently used to analyze signals and in this research was used to convert PV current to the frequency domain. BPNN is a machine-learning training method that corrects itself by changing the weight it gives to different layers of its understanding mechanism.
In the first step of the proposed method, a digital signal processor (DSP) unit is sampling AC components of the PV-side current until it achieves hundreds of points. Then, it uses the FFT algorithm to obtain frequency domain results and remove the components of the low-frequency range (less than 41 kHz) and high-frequency range (over 102.5 kHz).
In the following step, the remaining samples are divided into eight groups, feeding them to the BPNN analysis. Using those eight groups, the AI model processes the data and decides whether an arc exists. If it does, it sends a command to the PV-end DC/DC to interrupt the arc.
“The arc interrupting process can be done locally, eliminating the need for decisions to be made by the inverter level layer and cloud layer,” they added. “As a result, system reliability is relatively high. The disadvantage is that the algorithms are primarily implemented at the PV-end layer. Furthermore, because the training data is saved locally, the local units must have larger physical memory for data storage.”
The AI model is trained in two ways – online and offline. In the offline case, collected training data is fed into the algorithms in a computer, which upgrades the abilities of the DSP control software. The online training kicks into effect when the offline-based recognition fails. When it fails, the recorded data from the detection system is sent to the cloud, where the AI is further trained on them. Then, it sends the results back to the physical unit.
“The arc can be identified instantly utilizing FFT and AI analysis, and the arc detection time is less than 200 ms when an arc occurs,” the scientists said.
To test their detection method, they constructed a test platform. In between the platform’s PV and the inverter they connected an arc generator, a device that can create an arc for the AI to identify.
“The training results closely match the actual values,” they found. “Furthermore, 40 sets of testing data are used to validate the trained model. The testing results and created model match well. The success rate is 97.5 %, and just 1 out of 40 sets is incorrectly identified. The arc detection time is less than 200 ms when an arc occurs.”
The novel approach was presented in “A DC arc detection method for photovoltaic (PV) systems,” published in Results in Engineering.

A group of researchers at Sandia National Laboratories are studying ways to increase grid resilience to extreme weather storms and hackers. Their idea is to build a self-healing grid through various algorithms coded into grid relays. These detectors would quickly restore power for critical infrastructure, including hospitals, grocery stores, assisted living facilities, and water treatment plants, before operators can implement repairs or provide direction on moving forward.
Researchers at Sandia imagine these grid relays embedded in microgrids of renewable energy supplies and their local energy storage systems. The Sandia project is focused on ensuring these small islands of power around critical infrastructure can automatically heal themselves and connect to share electricity, powering as many users as possible.
Sandia researchers plan to build this resilience by ensuring microgrids can automate functions like balancing energy production with consumption and reconfiguring if part of the system is impaired. The algorithm must also prevent microgrids from forming an unintentional loop in the circuit. All while leveraging device-specific local measurements to avoid the costs of having to depend on power inverters that currently offer the high-speed communications necessary.
When it comes to automating energy production and consumption regulation, the Sandia-led team developed an algorithm based on the process inverters designed to power microgrids use when overloaded. However, instead of stopping to regulate the voltage of the power supply during surcharge, the new system uses the decrease in voltage to signal relays to disconnect power to less vital customers like those in individual homes.
Regarding reconfiguration, the automated process is based on computer-aided design software. The proposed algorithms of three small interconnected microgrids were able to isolate issues, including tree-downed lines or a damaged power plant, and then restore electricity to essential infrastructure.

13,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/26/fraunhofer-ise-amolf-reveal-details-of-record-breaking-36-1-efficient-triple-junction-silicon-solar-cell/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-01-26,"Fraunhofer ISE, AMOLF reveal details of record-breaking 36.1%-efficient triple-junction silicon solar cell","Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) and Dutch research institute AMOLF have provided an extensive technical description of the record-breaking silicon-based multijunction solar cell unveiled in late September.
In the paper “Wafer-bonded two-terminal III-V//Si triple-junction solar cell with power conversion efficiency of 36.1% at AM1.5 g,” published in Progress in Photovoltaics, scientists from the two research institutes explained that the main feature of the monolithic cell design consists of wafer-bonding the III-V top cell structure to the silicon bottom cell.
The triple-junction cell utilizes a top cell based on gallium indium phosphide (GaInP), a middle cell relying on gallium indium arsenide phosphide (GaInAsP), and a silicon tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) bottom cell. “The middle cell was deposited first and the top cell second on the GaAs substrate to reduce the voltage drop in the top cell due to a high thermal load,” the researchers explained. “The upright growth fashion made it necessary to temporarily bond the epitaxial structure to a sapphire wafer as mechanical support.”
The group attached the GaInP/GaInAsP top structure to the TOPCon devices by using surface-activated direct wafer bonding. They then implemented rear-side grating through nanoimprint lithography. The cell utilizes a metallodielectric back-side reflector to enhance light trapping in the bottom cell and a specially designed metal/polymer nanocoating provided by AMOLF.
“By employing a rear-heterojunction cell design in both the middle and top cell, the open-circuit voltage of the triple-junction device could be improved by 61 mV compared to previous generations,” the scientists explained. “Due to the high minority carrier lifetime of the n-absorber material, the external radiative efficiency is higher compared to a reference device with a homojunction cell design.”
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the triple-junction cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 36.1%, an open-circuit voltage of 3.309 V, a short-circuit density of 12.7 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 86.0%.
“The main reason for the higher efficiency compared to the last generation of III-V//Si triple-junction solar cells made at Fraunhofer ISE is the increase in open-circuit voltage by 61 mV,” the group explained. “The major difference compared to the previous generation is the inclusion of a rear-heterojunction cell configuration in place of the former homojunction cell design for the middle cell.”
Looking forward, the academics said they want to further reduce optical losses in the device through a four-layer anti-reflection coating. “The electrical losses in the silicon bottom cell due to surface recombination at the unpassivated mesa trenches will be alleviated in the future if this technology is scaled to larger solar cell sizes,” they stated.
