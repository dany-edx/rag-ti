https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/10/macquaries-second-renewable-energy-fund-raises-e1-6bn-for-large-scale-investment/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"FEBRUARY 10, 2021",Macquarie’s second renewable energy fund raises €1.6bn for large scale investment,"Last week, Green Investment Group (GIG), which is part of Australia-based venture capital fund Macquarie, launched Cero Generation with the intention of building an 8 GW solar project pipeline in Europe. Today, Macquarie has announced that the GIG's Renewable Energy Fund 2 has raised over €1.6 billion in investor commitments.
This is the second major GIG Renewable Energy Fund, the first was dedicated to an operational offshore wind fund and now manages investments in a 1.45 GW portfolio of six offshore wind farms around the United Kingdom.
The fundraising strategy, spearheaded by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA), which already overseas investments of 12.3 GW of green generation globally, vastly exceeded its original fundraising target. The 25-year, closed-end fund will invest in a diverse portfolio of solar and wind projects in Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, and New Zealand.
In a statement, Macquarie said that 32 different, though largely Eurocentric, investors contributed to the fund from pension funds, local government pension schemes, insurers and sovereign wealth funds. But it added, commitments were also received from investors in the Asia-Pacific and North America regions.
Leigh Harrison, head of MIRA for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said that the energy transition to renewables was the key driver for investors.
“Our changing climate presents profound challenges to our environment, economy and way of life,” said Harrison, “It is vital we take action to accelerate the shift to clean energy, building on the opportunities presented by rapid technological change, falling technology costs and strong political and regulatory support.”
The acceleration of GIG in recent months is not a surprise to Ivan Varughese, head of Asia-Pacific for GIG, who said last year: “Renewable energy infrastructure has proven to be a resilient investment, even in the face of Covid-19, because demand for electricity will still grow and the need to decarbonize remains an immediate one.”
The fund has already made two investments: a 10% stake in the 576 MW Gwynt y Môr Offshore Wind Farm in the U.K., and a 50% stake in a 268 MW portfolio of residential rooftop solar projects in the U.S.

The equipment, which the company dubbed ‘DUO machine', will be installed in a factory in Saransk, about 630km east of Moscow. It will be operated by the Center for Nanotechnologies and Nanomaterials of the Republic of Mordovia, and its partner Solartek.
“The corona[virus] pandemic has made it impossible to travel to Sweden from the countries and regions where our machine customers are located,” said Midsummer CEO Sven Lindström. “This has caused difficulties for us to make acceptance tests and install our already-sold DUO machines. Thanks to a new procedure that makes it possible to make final approvals through video link instead of on location in Järfälla, we have now been able to perform the acceptance test and ship the machine to Russia.”
Rusnano had been previously active in PV manufacturing with a stake in Russian solar module manufacturer Hevel Solar.
In November, Midsummer announced a plan to set up a 50 MW manufacturing facility in Bari, in the southern Italian region of Apulia. Earlier in July, it launched a 500 W solar panel it said is particularly suitable for large roofs. The Swedish manufacturer also recently announced that it had introduced a production process that can increase cell power output by around 10% while giving its products a more discreet look. Its Power Mesh Technology (PMT) is said to rely on a dense array of wires – rather than standard ribbons – for current collection, ensuring lower resistive losses in panels.

Germany-based Nice Solar Energy has opened the proceedings for self-administered insolvency at the Heilbronn District Court, in Germany. The insolvency proceedings under self-administration have been possible since 2012 under German insolvency law. Various PV companies have already used this process.
The CIGS thin-film photovoltaics specialist will now have three months to present a restructuring plan. In the meantime, business operations continue with no disruption, Nice Solar Energy said. The company cited the coronavirus pandemic as the reason for the insolvency proceedings. 
The company's shareholders are Manz AG, the China Energy Group, Shanghai Electric and the Beijing Future Science Park Development Group.
The joint venture was founded to advance the development of CIGS thin-film technology. It operates a module production line in order to transfer research and development activity into series production.
The company employs 160 people in Schwäbisch Hall, in southern Germany. At the end of 2019, Nice Solar Energy reported an efficiency of 17.6% for its CIGS modules – a new world record at the time. It was achieved on a module area of 120x60cm on Manz production systems.
Nice Energy is supported in the restructuring process by consultants from Ebner Stolz. The Heilbronn District Court has appointed the lawyer Andreas Kleinschmidt as trustee.

The company’s analysts reported that panel imports totaled 4,760 MW and domestic products accounted for 190 MW – which represents around 3.8% of the total market share. For comparison, in 2019, module imports reached 4,134 MW and domestic products totaled 139 MW.
The report also revealed that around 32% of the shipped modules employed monocrystalline PERC cell technology while this percentage a year earlier, stood at less than 10%. Polycrystalline PERC panels reached a 24% share, while for mono and poycrystalline standard modules, this percentage stood at 24% and 20%, respectively.
Canadian Solar, Trina Solar and Risen were the three largest providers last year, with shipments of 926 MW, 824 MW and 797 MW, respectively. Canadian Solar owns and operates a solar module factory in Sao Paulo and modules produced locally benefit from low-interest-rate financing from Brazil's development banks. Chinese battery and module maker BYD, which also operates a panel manufacturing facility in Brazil, was the fifth largest provider, with 526 MW of shipped modules, behind Jinko, which sold products with a combined capacity of 526 MW in Brazil last year.
Inverter shipments last year reached 4,900 MW, with 1,449 MW being shipped in the fourth quarter alone. A year earlier, total inverter shipments had totaled 3.48 GW.
The largest provider was China-based Sungrow, with 651 MW, followed by Chinese inverter maker Growatt, with 467 MW; and Austria's Fronius, with 456 MW. Particularly strong growth was registered in the segment of devices with capacities below 50 kW, Greener said in the report.
The report added, PV system prices in the distributed generation segment grew by 20% last year, due to the strong devaluation of the real and high logistical costs. In the previous years, instead, these prices have been decreasing constantly.
The average cost of a 4 kW project, for example, rose from BRL3.17/Wp ($0.58) in January 2020 to BRL3.30/Wp in January this year.
For a 50 kW system, the price grew from BRL2,49/Wp, to BRL2.72 while for a 1 MW installation, the bill increased from BRL2.34/Wp, to BRL2.55.
The Brazilian government is supporting distributed generation through Convention 16/15 (Convenio ICMS 16/2015), which exempts the owners of solar systems with a generation capacity of up to 1 MW from paying the ICMS state sales tax under a net metering regime open to projects no larger than 5 MW.

Poly manufacturer Tongwei said it would have a 30% stake in a joint venture by the partners to establish the wafer production capacity as part of a strategic cooperation with module giant Jinko.
In return, Jinko will invest 35% of the cost of a new 45,000-ton annual production capacity polysilicon fab to supply the planned wafer site, which will have preemptive rights to 60% of the silicon produced by the partner facility.
As part of the cooperation Jinko, which in November signed a two-year deal to buy 93,000 metric tons of polysilicon from Tongwei, agreed to, in return, supply its partner with 6.5 GW of solar wafers.
Tongwei reached more than 80,000 metric tons of annual polysilicon production capacity last year, with the scale set to grow to 290,000 tons before 2024. The 19 GW of solar modules shipped by Jinko last year earned it second ranking on the panel supplier list compiled by Taiwanese data company PV Infolink.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/10/from-power-to-energy-rating-for-a-better-choice-of-pv-module/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,QUALITY,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"FEBRUARY 10, 2021","From power to energy rating, for a better choice of PV module","Power and efficiency ratings are key for both buyers and sellers and PV modules, in demonstrating the quality and performance of the product. However, as solar power makes its way both into more regions of the world, and more specific applications, it is becoming apparent that the performance of the same module can vary greatly depending on the local climate and other factors, something which is not accounted for in power ratings measured under standard test conditions, even though it can potentially have severe effects on project economics further down the line.
This issue is examined in detail in a new report published by the International Energy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power Systems Program (IEA PVPS) – an international working group that aims to improve quality and reliability in the PV industry.
The report, Climatic Rating of Photovoltaic Modules: Different Technologies for Various Operating Conditions, outlines the need for modules to be assessed on a realistic estimate of performance in different climatic conditions. Providing a ‘climate-specific energy rating’, rather than the standard power rating, say the authors, would allow buyers to compare the performance of different products and make a better decision based on the parameters of their specific project.
“The criteria for the selection of a PV module should shift from a power-based rating to a more accurate and climate-specific rating on the expected lifetime yield e.g. an energy-based rating…,” state the report’s authors. “Deeper knowledge in energy rating can have multiple benefits.”
They explain that for manufacturers, the energy rating demonstrates performance in varying climates. Project developers would be able to make more accurate yield assessments early on in a project, and policymakers could more accurately calculate requirements for product lifetime, quality and ecodesign.
The report notes encouraging developments already on this shift, with standards body the IEC introducing a simple methodology to obtain performance estimates for different climates. But for ‘energy ratings’ to become an accurate industry standard, much more work is needed – to take into account different degradation mechanisms, and to adapt to technological developments such as the recent growth of bifacial modules.
“Climate classification presents a multifaceted problem, in which solutions have to balance specificity, accuracy, simplicity, and applicability,” the report concludes. “Efforts have been made, but still the correlation with field-observed degradation modes are needed.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/10/italys-next-renewables-auction-may-deliver-even-worse-result/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"FEBRUARY 10, 2021",Italy’s next renewables auction may deliver even worse result,"Italy’s last three renewables tenders for projects exceeding 1 MW went under-subscribed, with prices following an upward trend, in stark contrast with the Spanish case. According to several experts and analysts, the Italian procurement exercises are a “fiasco” because of the lack of authorizations and the difficulty to obtain favorable land – usually agricultural, plus Italy’s convoluted bureaucracy.
All these elements might bring about even worse results in the ongoing, 700 MW, fifth tender round. “Honestly, I expect even worse results,” Mauro Moroni, chief executive of Moroni & Partners, a provider of engineering services to energy plants and part of the Kiwa Group, told pv magazine. Gianluca Biagio Biscotti, founder of the engineering consulting firm BFP, shared Moroni’s bleak perception of the next tender.
“In fact, a number of significantly lower requests than the quotas available is also expected for the next auction sessions. Therefore, in excess of supply, operators will keep the prices offered very close to that of the starting price of €70/MWh,” he told pv magazine.
According to Moroni, the bleak scenario has mainly to do with the lack of appropriate locations. “The plants eligible for the tender are essentially those on industrial land, which are few and generally of limited power. As a result, auctions have faced, and will face scarce participation again. To be clear, only 356.8 MW were requested for large plants, compared to the 1,374.1 [MW] available.”
In Italy’s fourth renewables auction, the procurement exercise's lowest bid came in at €0.06819/kWh and was submitted for a 10 MW solar project.
While the Italian energy agency (GSE) was announcing the results of the fourth renewables auction, Spanish authorities awarded about 2.04 GW of PV and 998 MW of wind capacity, out of a total allocation of approximately 3.03 GW. The average price for solar was €0.02447/kWh, less than half the Italian price.
“The contemporaneity of the fourth GSE auction with the Spanish auction dramatically highlighted the Italian flop. The last Spanish auction closed with requests for three times the power of the available quota. The Italian one has allocated about a quarter of the available quota,” said Biscotti. The point is that, given the low demand, competition on the tariffs is very limited. “Professional operators are aware of the authorization situation in Italy, and clearly know that they do not have to make great efforts to access incentives. Even in this auction, the energy prices for photovoltaics are significantly higher than those of the first auction,” explained Moroni.
On the other hand, according to him, Spanish rates are theoretically possible also in Italy. “It will be possible to obtain rates comparable to those in Spain if access to auctions is also allowed for plants installed in agricultural areas,” Moroni told pv magazine.
Given Italy's attention to sustainability, alternative solutions with marginally higher opex and capex could also be considered. For instance, Moroni mentions the construction of agro-photovoltaic plants equipped with storage, or a portion dedicated to green hydrogen or green mobility.
The shortage in authorized projects on industrial land and the unavailability of agricultural areas are the main reasons for the “flop.” This outcome is strongly connected, according to experts, to a convoluted bureaucratic system.
“The Italian bureaucracy is the reason for a very high death ratio for authorizations, causing delays on the authorization. In practice, authorization times are double or triple compared to what is stated in the law. There can even be cases of up to 10 years. Let me give you an example: As BFP, we have been operating on the market for almost 20 years, nevertheless, we have in our portfolio a simple 1 MWp PV project in Puglia in an unconstrained agricultural area for which the first request for authorization dates back to 2008. After three appeals to the regional administrative court (one still pending) and two to the appeals court (one still pending) – all won – it has not yet been authorized up [to] today. And it is a small, 1 MWp plant. Just imagine what can happen to large photovoltaic or wind farms similar to the Spanish ones,” elaborated Biscotti.
A possible solution is the simplification of the authorization process. Experts also call for some incentive mechanisms for civil servants and authorities, to prevent the mistaken rejection of projects. This highly political reform would require a solid government, with ministries collaborating on new laws and new licences. Other measures, other tweaks, could help too.
“A sort of change of perspective would be needed. For instance, instead of the unsuitable areas established in 2010, it is suggested a definition [should be made] of the suitable areas in which the PV and wind power plants should be authorized in a fixed time, unless there are concrete and proven, serious reasons [against], to be defined by the public administration. By decreasing bureaucratic obstacles, not only will authorizations on the market increase but development costs will decrease, with a direct reflection on the price of energy which, in our vision, in Southern Italy, will have no difficulty in falling to €40/MWh,” concluded Biscotti.
According to Alberto Pinori, president of ANIE Rinnovabili, the authorization problem that afflicts PV and wind, mainly for “landscape reasons,” can hardly be remedied in a short time because the authorization processes have long time frames. “A political intervention is needed if we want to try to remedy it in the immediate future. The lack of projects is reflected in the formation of the price offered,” he wrote, to pv magazine.
ANIE Rinnovabili agrees on the need to change gear, explaining that the number of new installations is far from that required to reach the 2030 objectives.
But there are silver linings.
“The 2020 PV data comfort us: In the first ten months, we installed … 25% [more] new power, compared to 2019, despite the pandemic. We have, however, recorded [a block on the] authorization … of utility scale plants – for which most operators are developing business plans in market parity.”

Members of the parliament's committee on environment, public health and food safety endorsed the proposal by 58 votes to eight, with ten abstentions, on Friday and the matter is expected to be voted on by the full plenary during the session planned from March 8-11, with legislators at the European Commission expected to present a proposal before July.
The environment committee members said the carbon border should be used to extend the greenhouse-gas-abatement requirements applied to EU businesses by the bloc's emissions trading system – the EU ETS – to all companies which export goods and commodities into the region.
Committee members said the emissions levy to be applied to goods at a proposed, World Trade Organization-compliant carbon border should be linked to the carbon price determined by the EU ETS and should encompass, by 2023, the power sector and the bloc's most carbon intensive industries, including cement, steel, oil refining, aluminum, paper, glass, chemicals and fertilizers.
Green Party MEP for West France Yannick Jadot said the proposed EU carbon border adjustment mechanism, or CBAM, will offer “a major political and democratic test for the EU, which must stop being naïve and impose the same carbon price on products, whether they are produced in or outside the EU, to ensure the most polluting sectors also take part in fighting climate change and innovate towards zero carbon.”
Jadot added: “Parliament is leading the way and we expect the same level of ambition from the commission and member states.”

The scientists explained that the device was built with a new cell architecture, named CARLAH, which is based on what they called a “high-temperature heterojunction” approach. The special architecture is created by combining ultra-thin polycrystalline silicon layers, with a thickness of up to 20 nm, with films of passivated transparent conductive oxide (TCO) contacts.
“Our teams have designed a simplified processing method that generates strong ‘external getter' effects (extraction of metallic impurities) suitable for low-cost crystalline silicon (c-Si) substrates with a low carbon footprint,” the research institute specified. “The structures created are, moreover, compatible with integration in Perovskites/c-Si tandem cells.”
The French research group stated that passivated contacts for solar cells are commonly fabricated with tin-doped indium oxide (ITO), which has high costs due to the limited availability of indium. “In order to improve the economical balance and environmental footprint of this type of cell, the ITO layers usually used on the front panel have been compared by our laboratories with Zinc (AZO) based layers on single junction structures,” it further explained. “Like ITO, the AZO layers studied here are deposited by physical vapor deposition (PVD), a process that facilitates their transfer to industry.”
The solar cell was built in industrial format (M2) and its efficiency is currently a world record for this type of cell on an industrial scale, the researchers said.
Liten achieved a 24.25% peak efficiency for a silicon heterojunction solar cell in December 2019. The cell developers said at the time they were able to increase performance by improving the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition of amorphous silicon nanolayers and the conductive and anti-reflective transparent oxide layers. They also reduced wafer-handling damage during manufacturing.

Germany's TÜV Rheinland has developed PV TravelLab, a mobile laboratory to test solar modules.
The small, portable lab can be completely dismantled, so it can fit into seven transport cases for easy transport as airplane luggage. TÜV Rheinland jointly developed the testing system with Germany's MBJ Solutions, which specializes in testing and measurement systems for the PV industry.
TÜV Rheinland has claimed that the portable laboratory can conduct on-site module tests according to relevant IEC standards – at the port, shortly before installation, and even at solar project sites. Test data can be made immediately available on site for detailed assessments. The only requirement is a testing environment that can be darkened, like an empty freight container, for example.
PV TravelLab is designed to test up to 150 to 200 solar modules per day and combines the latest measurement technologies for PV devices. The light source is certified according to IEC 60904-9 Ed.3 and ensures power measurements with very low measurement uncertainty, even with new module technologies.
With a measuring range of 0 V to 250 V and 0 amperes to 20 amperes, the testing lab can assess both highly efficient crystalline solar panels and thin-film PV modules. For PERC or heterojunction PV modules, TÜV Rheinland's own “Dynamic I-V” process can be used. Bypass diode tests are also possible.
For electroluminescence measurements, the modules are pushed over EL cameras in a measuring frame mounted on rollers, TÜV Rheinland said. Two 5-megapixel cameras generate images of the PV modules to quickly highlight cell cracks, as well as problems in the connections of cells, or potential induced degradation (PID) and light and elevated temperature-induced degradation (LeTID). The portable lab can also be used to conduct EL analysis at 10% of the nominal short-circuit current, thanks to the system's sensitive cameras, TÜV Rheinland claimed.

The Pure Hydrogen International joint venture – comprising Liberty Hydrogen and Real Energy’s wholly owned offshoot, Pure Hydrogen – has signed a term sheet with hydrogen developer Port Anthony Renewables to build a 20-ton-per-day hydrogen production facility at Port Anthony, about 200 kilometers southeast of Melbourne, Australia.
Pure Hydrogen and Liberty Hydrogen established a joint venture company several weeks ago to develop a network of hydrogen manufacturing and distribution hubs. Two of those facilities will be built in Queensland, and one each will be constructed in New South Wales and Victoria.
Real Energy Managing Director Scott Brown said that the Port Anthony site is ideally suited to the company’s goal to build and develop a large-scale hydrogen business. The location could also provide access to shipping and road transportation – facilities that should allow for the export of any product that is not needed domestically.
“This is an ideal site for a hydrogen hub with the necessary attributes to cater for both domestic and international markets,” Brown said. “This agreement builds on our strategy of co-operating and collaborating with experienced operators to develop a significant hydrogen business capable of servicing a large customer base.”
Brown said that the Port Anthony project, which was originally being developed by Liberty Hydrogen, would utilize “best-of-breed hydrogen and fuel cell technology.” It is expected that the project will involve the use of an electrolyzer to produce hydrogen, powered by electricity sourced through either ‘blue’ or ‘green’ power purchase agreements.
The project is one of four hydrogen manufacturing and distribution hubs that Pure Hydrogen is planning for Australia’s East Coast. It also has similar ventures in development for the port cities of Gladstone, Mackay, and Newcastle.
“We are making solid progress securing site control at our other three planned hubs, as well as potential new locations, as well as advancing further technology and new customer agreements with further updates pending,” Brown said.
Port Anthony has long been a hub for offshore oil and gas exploration and production. Port Anthony Renewables Executive Chairman Ben Anthony said that the shift to hydrogen would ensure that it remains a cornerstone of Australia’s energy sector.
“This change of direction is in line with both current and future community expectations,” Anthony said.
He added that the transition will build on Australia’s efforts to decarbonize a large energy-based industry by engaging in activities that substantially reduce carbon emissions.
“This deal with Pure Hydrogen International is yet another opportunity to show Port Anthony can manoeuvre itself to continue to provide that service to Australia through a greener way of operating,” Anthony said. “Port Anthony will continue to undertake the same activities it has for the many years, while at the same time reducing its carbon footprint.”

Abu Dhabi-based Masdar has achieved first close on its acquisition of a 50% stake in a 1.6 GW project portfolio in the United States from EDF Renewables North America. It did not disclose the financial terms of the transaction.
Masdar and EDF Renewables North America announced a deal last year to partner on eight renewable energy projects. They included five solar PV projects in California, totaling 689 MW, 75 MW of lithium-ion storage capacity at two sites, and 815 MW of wind capacity at three locations spread across Nebraska and Texas.
Four of the solar projects started commercial operations in December – all in Riverside County. These include the Desert Harvest 1 and Desert Harvest 2 projects, at 213 MW of combined capacity. The other two arrays are the Maverick 1 and Maverick 4 projects, which total 309 MW.
Big Beau, a 128 MW solar PV and 40 MW/160 MWh battery energy storage system, is in Kern County and is set to reach commercial operation in December. All three wind projects are expected to begin commercial operations during the first quarter. Power from the portfolio projects will be sold under long-term contracts to a range of offtakers, including utilities, hedge providers, and community choice aggregators.
Masdar entered the U.S. market in 2019, when it acquired a 50% interest in two wind farms in Texas and New Mexico. Masdar CEO Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi said the U.S. market offers “considerable scope for further growth.” He added that with President Joe Biden having made clean energy investment a key priority for his administration, “we clearly anticipate greater opportunities in this market.”
