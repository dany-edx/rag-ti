The site was the subject of a feasibility study by the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). They determined that a floating solar power plant with 40 MW to 50 MW capacity could be set up there.
“We express our sincere commitment to deliver the project in the shortest possible time using the world’s most efficient technologies,” said Latif Khan, the director of Summit Power.
Barapukuria Coal Mining Co. officials have noted that a number of Chinese companies also expressed interest in developing the site.
Summit Power, which is listed on the Dhaka Stock Exchange, wants to build the solar plant in cooperation with Barapukuria Coal Mining. It said it aims to implement the project as a lead member under a land lease agreement. However, it said it is also open to revenue sharing or any other arrangements proposed by the government.
Presently, there is only one floating solar power plant in Bangladesh. The 10 kW facility was set up by Solar EPC Development Ltd., a private sector developer. It was built on a pond in the municipality of Mongla, in southwestern Bangladesh. The company is now waiting for approval to set up a 10 MW floating solar plant on the same pond.
Separately, the Bangladeshi government is working on setting up a 50 MW floating solar power plant on Kaptai Lake in Rangamati district. Currently, the country's renewables capacity stands at 790 MW. About 556 MW of the total is solar power. The country aims to generate 40% electricity from renewables by 2041.

The Al Taweelah site is located in Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (KIZAD), about halfway between the cities of Abu Dhabi and Dubai.
According to ACWA, the facility is 44% largest than the world’s current largest reverse osmosis (RO) plant in terms of capacity. It is able to meet water demand for more than 350,000 households.
“Al Taweelah now provides 100 million gallons of desalinated water per day, and will eventually reach 200 million gallons per day, making it the world’s largest reverse osmosis (RO) facility with a capacity of 909,200 cubic meters per day,” the Saudi company said. “The plant supports the industries and the community at Al Taweelah and the surrounding areas, and will additionally play a key role in catering to Abu Dhabi’s peak water demand, which is expected to rise by Q1 in 2023.”
ACWA did not reveal any details about the solar park that is being used to cover part of the desalination unit's electricity demand.
“Solar energy is expected to account for at least 30% of the project’s electricity capacity within eight years, with a target of raising this figure to 55% by the end of the first quarter life of the project,” the company said.
According to ACWA's website, the solar park is about 69 MW in size. The total investment in the entire water plant is $874 million. ACWA owns a 40% stake in the project, while the remaining share is held by UAE-based Mubadala Capital and Abu Dhabi National Energy Co.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/23/caribbean-neighbors-move-on-solar-storage/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",MAX HALL,"JUNE 23, 2022","Caribbean neighbors move on solar, storage","Two Caribbean nations have made steps toward the energy transition with a tax exemption for lithium-ion batteries and financing for new solar and energy storage projects.
Jamaica said this week that lithium batteries will be exempted from its General Consumption Tax (GCT). GCT is a value-added tax applied on goods and services in the nation, usually at a rate of 15% plus 5% on imported goods, as would be the case for lithium batteries.
An announcement of the CGT exemption, issued by the government's Jamaica Information Service, stated that the GCT on lithium batteries generated $193 million for state coffers in 2019. It is not clear whether the figure stated was in US dollars or in Jamaican dollars, which would be the equivalent of $1.26 million at the current exchange rate.
Some 100,000 lithium batteries imported by Jamaica had already benefited from a two-year exemption from the 10% to 20% Common External Tariff (CET) levied by the 15 members of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) trade area on goods sourced from non-Caricom states. The CET exemption expired in April 2021 and the Jamaican Ministry of Finance and the Public Service has made no objection to a request by the Ministry of Science, Energy and Technology that lithium batteries secure another CET exemption.
Caricom's Council for Trade and Economic Development will consider a request to exempt another 240,000 batteries from CET in a two-year arrangement that would run to the end of 2023.
Fellow Caricom founding member Guyana last week benefited from a decision by the Inter-American Development Bank to approve a GYD 16.6 billion ($75.8 million) finance package for solar and storage projects in the South American nation.
An announcement of the decision, made by Guyana's Department of Public Information (DPI) this week, did not reveal whether the finance would be comprised of grant or loan funding but it is likely to be the latter, given the bank's business model. The DPI article said the cash would be used to back 33 MWp of solar generation capacity and at least 34 MWh of energy storage facilities, under the Guyana Utility Scale Solar Photovoltaic Programme.
The initiative involves 10 MWp of solar capacity on the Demerara-Berbice grid, 15 MWp of solar and at least 22 MWh of battery storage on the Linden network, and 8 MWp plus at least 12 MWh of battery storage on the Essequibo grid, in the interior of Guyana.
The DPI statement did not indicate whether the Inter-American Development Bank funding would finance all of the planned generation and storage capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/23/agrivoltaics-for-broccoli-cabbage/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 23, 2022","Agrivoltaics for broccoli, cabbage","A research team at Chonnam National University in South Korea has looked at how solar power generation could be combined with broccoli and cabbage cultivation. The team found that the shading provided by a PV facility could improve the quality of crops.
Broccoli and cabbage need to be grown in places that receive full sun, which means between six and eight hours of sunlight per day, or very light shade. A lack of sunlight could result in thin, leggy plants.
“Because of its low light saturation points, broccoli may be a suitable crop to maximize famer’s profits and energy security through an agrivoltaic system,” the scientists said. “However, to date, there is limited information on the performance of brassica crops in agrivoltaics.”
The scientists built their agrivoltaic system with bifacial modules at a height of 3.3 meters. They achieved an average power generation per day of 127 kWh during the testing period. They claimed that their approach demonstrated the technical and economic viability of the proposed agrivoltaic solution.
“We found that the taste and the quality of the broccoli were not lower than those of a reference field without the solar array,” they said. “We also found no significant change in functional ingredients and metabolites that affect taste.”

The PV installation caused a significant reduction in the light hitting the crops, which in turn resulted in an improvement of their color.
“The color of broccoli is an important property that goes beyond appearance quality and is involved in consumers’ desire to purchase,” the scientists said.
They said that presence of the PV system reduced the agricultural yield by around 20%, compared to the reference field without solar. However, they said that the income generated by the solar array could more than compensate for such losses.
“The annual economic benefit from solar power was 10.4 times more than the broccoli production benefits,” the scientists said. “Therefore, farmer benefits will increase as they are cultivated in agrivoltaics compared to open field.”
The researchers presented their findings in “Agrivoltaic Systems Enhance Farmers’ Profits through Broccoli Visual Quality and Electricity Production,” which was recently published in Agronomy.
“In terms of land use efficiency, agrivoltaic is a good means of producing energy and food in Korea, which is a highly mountainous area,” they said.

(Toshiba EES), a unit of Japanese conglomerate Toshiba, has agreed to team up with a Sweden's Echandia to jointly develop pure hydrogen fuel cell systems for ships.
The two companies aim to build a pure hydrogen fuel cell system that will rely on Toshiba ESS’s pure hydrogen fuel cells. Such a system could be used for continuous operation in marine applications, they said.
“Echandia and Toshiba ESS will consider the possibility of incorporating the next-generation pure hydrogen fuel cell currently under development by Toshiba ESS into the electric propulsion systems for ships being developed by Echandia, with the joint aim of commercializing a longer-life pure hydrogen fuel cell system around 2024,” the companies said. “By integrating these next-generation pure hydrogen fuel cells, the systems for ships currently under development are expected to last approximately 200% longer.”
Toshiba has developed different fuel cell systems over the past few decades, including a 3.5 kW hydrogen fuel cell system that is currently being tested Fukushima prefecture, Japan. The system is based on a solid polymer fuel cell stack which eliminates the need for an external humidifier, according to the manufacturer. The stack is internally humidified and dehumidified automatically to keep it at optimum humidity.
It also developed a scalable 100 kW system that can be used for large scale applications. According to the company, this system shows a power generation efficiency of 50% and an overall efficiency of 95 %.
“Cell Stack is the core technology of fuel cell systems and our unique technology makes it possible to optimize the water balance inside the cell, which is necessary to maximize the performance of the fuel cell, without the need for an external humidifier,” the company said on its website. “Toshiba is developing the Pure hydrogen fuel cell systems for vehicles, a versatile fuel cell module with high output, high durability, compactness, and light weight that is suitable for heavy duty usage.”
Toshiba relocated its hydrogen site to Ukishima, in the Japanese city of Kawasaki, in 2019. It said at the time that it had delivered more than 120 H2Rex hydrogen systems for wholesale markets, hotels, convenience stores and sports facilities.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/23/in-the-far-reaches-of-northern-mexico/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,MINIGRID,SPONSORED,MEXICO,WORLD",,"JUNE 23, 2022",In the far reaches of northern Mexico,"The state of Chihuahua, in northern Mexico, is the largest in the country, with a land area similar to that of the United Kingdom. But with a density of around 15 inhabitants per square kilometer, it is also one of Mexico’s least populated regions. Noteworthy though, is the fact that Chihuahua has one of the highest sunshine indices in the world.
Chihuahua covers a diverse landscape, ranging from the desert that borders the United States to a plain that extends to the southwest and ends in a mountainous area. It is easy to imagine how this translates into the territory’s isolation from the electrical network, and therefore an electrical shortage.
Thankfully, two projects serve as examples of how a reliable solar power supply can be brought to such regions at a fraction of the cost of diesel generators and other options. Both are autonomous microgrids powered by solar: the first a 12.7 kW array located in the municipality of Urique, and the second a 3.2 kW PV installation, on an agricultural ranch located in El Oasis, a town in the municipality of Ojinaga.
The first case involves powering the facilities of a local university, the Universidad Tecnológica, near the town of San Rafael, in a mountainous area difficult to access.
“Moving the equipment there required the use of a 4×4 car,” explains industrial electronics engineer Regino Gaytán, who was in charge of developing the project, which arose from a statewide bidding process in which around nine proposals were submitted. “We were chosen because, in addition to giving the best price, we presented the best type of structure for the type of climate in that mountainous area, which at certain times of the year is very windy with gusts that sometimes reach 100 km/h”.
“To avoid that problem,” Gaytán continues, “we built a combination of stainless steel and aluminum for mounting the panels, a shed structure mounted on tall poles, without walls, 2.5 meters high in one section and 4 meters high in the other. The shaded area underneath is used as an outdoor classroom area where students have ready access to power outlets and laptop chargers.
The equipment, which took three months to install, consists of 505 W modules, “a relatively new model in the photovoltaic market, with 210 mm cell technologies,” says Carlos Gutiérrez Benítez, SolarEver’s deputy director of manufacturing.
Three Growatt off-grid inverters (SPF 3000TL LVM) integrated with an MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) solar charge controller, a high-frequency pure sine wave inverter and uninterruptible power supply function in a single machine. Backing up the energy storage with 48 V in module design are 10x 2.56 kWh lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries, also from Growatt.

Until the start-up of the microgrid in October last year, the facilities were powered by diesel generators – of which two remain as backup – the average monthly fuel cost prior to adding the solar microgrid was more than $1,000.
The new photovoltaic installation covers the needs from Monday to Saturday of air conditioning and heating systems, lighting, chemistry laboratories and welding equipment, among others, benefiting a group of 110 people, including teaching and administrative staff and students, many of whom come from several nearby indigenous communities.
The other microgrid system serves a newly constructed agricultural ranch growing cotton, corn, and watermelon, located about 70 km from the US border. In this case it is an installation for home use, smaller than the previous one, to supply energy for a refrigerator, air conditioning, lighting and heating.
SolarEver’s Gutiérrez Benítez breaks down the 3.2 kW installation into six 540 W modules with 182 mm cells, which he says is the best-selling line, offering flexibility for more types of project; and which adapts easily to more inverters with any type of capacity. The configuration is completed with a Growatt SPF 4000T DVM inverter, which also provides two batteries similar to those described in the previous project – that is, 2.5 kWh each.

“This is an example of projects for home use, and part of a strategy we are adopting with Growatt,” adds Gutiérrez Benítez. “It is about adapting these new technologies with inverters and batteries offline, in areas that do not have access to a power grid.”
On this occasion, according to developer Calvin Penner, both the analysis of the work field and the installation of the equipment took two days each. The challenge this time around was the area, with a lot of suspended desert dust that still presents challenges,” he acknowledges. However, the installed solar energy storage system works stably in these harsh conditions to deliver reliable clean power for the ranch.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/23/retc-releases-2022-module-index-report/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 23, 2022",RETC releases 2022 Module Index Report,"From pv magazine USA
The Renewable Energy Test Center (RETC) has released its “2022 PV Module Index” (PVMI) report, highlighting module performance across a variety of lab tests, while also providing industry-cited clarifications on the real-world significance of the results.
The 2022 PVMI marks the first edition released since VDE acquired a 70% stake in RECT. President and CEO Cherif Kedir said the move will allow RETC to expand its testing services to a broader network of manufacturers, investors, insurers and developers, all in pursuit of minimizing risk and uncertainty in favor of long-term reliability, sustainability and profitability by designing better data-driven risk mitigation programs and service products.
RETC Vice President of Business Development Daniel Chang told pv magazine the 2022 PVMI takes a more forward-looking approach than previous editions, supplementing testing results and hardware performance with emerging industry trends that are going to guide the use of this hardware and investments in projects that utilize it into 2023 and beyond.
“We focus on what we think are going to be topics that are going to be relevant for the upcoming year, like the onset of N-Type modules, and field services,” explained Chang. “There are a lot of installations out there degrading at a faster pace than expected. These installations are investments in assets made by banks to yield some sort of financial benefit to them, right? If they have some sort of degradation, then that’s not performing the way that was expected and planned for.”
Specifically, RETC is interested in forensic analysis of PV systems to determine the root causes of underperformance. This investigation is the culmination of different analyses to be done over the life of a project, starting with a baseline third-party module health assessment during project commissioning.
In instances of underperformance, RETC recommends Electroluminescence (EL) testing. EL testing uses a special camera system to document the light emissions that occur when an electrical current passes through PV cells. The technology has long been used in labs to detect a wide range of hidden module defects.
Another aspect of forensic analysis is predictive maintenance, wherein a third party inspects plants from periodically to detect issues that may not be visible at a base overview, but could develop into much larger issues if allowed to linger.
While Chang brought to light the ongoing issue of degradation and the developing need for advanced field services, Kedir focused more on the technology side, researching where the next wave of module innovation will come in a post-large-format world.
That innovation, he thinks, will come from heterojunction n-type modules (HJT).
“I think leading manufacturers are kind of a crossroad point right now, in terms of how to get more power out of modules without making the modules just unreasonably large, because they’re already pretty damn big,” Kedir said. “The other reason I think manufacturers may be hesitant to make their modules larger is that everybody is testing the waters with heterojunction cells, so that they can eke out more more watts per module, without having to increase the size. With the module technologies they currently have, I don’t think they’re able to get a lot more efficiency out of the cell, so they’re trying to figure out how to get more power without increasing the module size, and the next, the next logical thing is to go to different technologies, Topcon and heterojunction.”
In an op-ed for pv magazine in November 2021, Nadeem Haque – chief technology officer at Heliene – outlined some of the distinct technology advantages that HJT presents. HJT cell manufacturing involves the deposition of an amorphous layer of silicon on both the top and bottom of the wafer followed by a transparent conducting oxide deposition and making of metal contacts.
HJT cell production lines are currently expensive, almost prohibitively so, and new lines need to be built. The cells require a more expensive metallization paste to manufacture. HJT cells are by nature bifacial, with bifaciality rates above 90%, the highest of any cell technology. Higher bifaciality and lower temperature coefficients result in higher energy output, and HJT cells in mass production are expected to reach about 27% efficiency.
“You can gauge where the industry is going based on where investment money is going, and we hear a lot about companies investing money in heterojunction cell lines in Asia, so I think that’s probably going to be a trend,” said Kedir.
The last industry trend examined by RETC is mitigating the effects of extreme weather on PV systems, a topic which pv magazine has reported on extensively with RETC and other partners, like VDE Americas.
Module index
The core of the report is a review of modules’ performance across a range of tests that are designed to go beyond the parameters of tests for certification and accurately project what each module’s strengths are, rather than compare and rank them against one another.
The tests are split up into three categories, each of which analyzes a different aspect of module excellence: quality indicators, performance indicators, and reliability indicators. In testing, the researchers at RETC noticed a new trend that some of the performance and reliability gaps from manufacturer to manufacturer have widened, as opposed to the narrowing they observed in recent years.
“Some of the issues that we saw over the last year have been related to manufacturers faced with their own supply chain issues and inability to get their raw materials,” explained Kedir. “They’ve had to go to other sources, secondary and tertiary sources of cells and backsheets, and then that triggered a few failures, we saw more of them last year. What’s been lingering is potential-induced degradation (PID) and some related performance stuff. On cells, PID, for all intents and purposes, had been completely solved a few years ago, but then it reappeared throughout the pandemic, with the supply chain issues, we see some of that leftover.”
This is a phenomenon that Kedir expects to see continue, at least in the short term. The issue may linger as a result of the recently-announced two year moratorium on the DOC’s anticircumvention case, he said.
“Demand is going to is going to pick up in the US,” he began. “The upcoming traceability requirements are going to put a constraint on the cell supply from forced labor regions, which means you’re not going to have enough cell supply for them for the market demands. This causes supply separation between manufacturers. Some larger manufacturers have already completely mitigated that issue, developed a new supply chain for polycrystal, and have new cell lines in Southeast Asia. Those guys are going to fare out much better than a manufacturer who hasn’t put in that infrastructure already. They’re going to have to try to source cells from other places or other manufacturers that may or may not be as good as their initial supply.”
While the gap between top-tier, established module manufacturers and some newer market entrants is widening, RETC still had a number of manufacturers perform well across their litany of tests.
Based on available testing data, RETC highlighted Hanwha Q CELLS, JA Solar, Jinko Solar, LONGi Solar, Trina Solar, and Yingli Solar as the overall top performers of the year. The recognition does not stop with the top performers, however, and RETC listed some of the manufacturers who scored the highest marks in individual tests, listed below.
Hail durability:
Thresher test:
LID resistance:
LeTID resistance:
Module efficiency:
Pan file performance:
PTC-to-STC ratio
Damp heat test
Dynamic mechanical load test:
PID resistance:
Thermal cycle test:
RETC said the rankings are comprehensive only to data that the company has collected, so modules from other manufacturers could perform similarly to the ones listed above, but the organization cannot make an overall determination regarding high achievement in manufacturing without module tests data across the three categories.
The report concludes with a look at a number of notable changes and revisions anticipated in the upcoming edition of IEC 61730, a two-part standard pertaining to PV module safety qualification, as well as upcoming updates to IEC TS 62915, a technical specification pertaining to PV module approval, design and safety qualification.
The standards analysis is expansive, and pv magazine will cover these pending changes in a follow-up to this article.
Edit 6/24/22: This article was edited and re-published to recognize additional companies who earned recognition in individual tests, as well as top performers. We apologize for the oversight.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/23/debunking-myths-about-pv-system-orientation-dimensioning/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,FINLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 23, 2022","Debunking myths about PV system orientation, dimensioning","Researchers from Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT) claim to have debunked three myths about the orientation and dimensioning of PV systems and the sale of surplus electricity.
“The results are applicable to the conditions in the north, but the methods are applicable everywhere,” a spokesperson for LUT told pv magazine. “Our experts would like to take a closer look at other data and other countries' data for solar electricity, energy consumption, and electricity prices.”
In a first study – “Optimization of rooftop photovoltaic installations to maximize revenue in Finland based on customer class load profiles and simulated generation,” published in Solar Energy – the scientists considered a PV system orientation based on profitability. They used hourly data from 13 different statistical customer class load profiles, historical electricity market price data for the 2016-20 period, and simulated solar PV yield from southern Finland.
The research group compared single-azimuth and dual-azimuth systems. It found that the first project typology was more profitable under a net metering regime, with optimal orientations being identified at azimuth angles of -15 degree to -5 degrees and at tilt angles of 35 degrees to -45 degrees.
“However, if no compensation is paid for surplus electricity, it is usually more profitable to minimize the electricity purchase by orienting the solar PV modules in two azimuths between east and west with tilt angles of 10 degrees to -55 degrees, depending on the capacity of the solar PV system and the load profile,” they said.
An east-west orientation could lead to financial losses of 15% compared to a south-facing system, when net metering is not in place and self-consumption must be maximized.
“A south orientation is economically viable regardless of the consumption profile. There is no single correct orientation. The choice depends on whether you want to maximize self-sufficiency in electricity generation or profitability,” said Altti Meriläinen, an electrical engineering research assistant at LUT University.
Optimal dimensioning
In “Optimal dimensioning of a solar PV plant with measured electrical load curves in Finland,” which was recently published in Solar Energy, another research team investigated the profitability of PV systems for self-consumption. They focused on a grocery store, a dairy farm, and a home in southern Finland.
“The profitability of the PV power system was studied by using internal interest rate, net present value, discounted payback period, and self-consumption rate,” the researchers said.
They found that the respective internal rates of return were 6.8%, 6.6%, and 1.4% for the grocery store, dairy farm, and home. For the grocery store and the dairy farm, the PV system size could be increased without the internal rate of return decreasing significantly, which would justify a larger installation. By contrast, using the self-consumption ratio to optimize the PV power system size could result in an undersized system.
”In single-family houses, the best or most profitable solution is the over-dimensioning of the solar PV system. In larger buildings, 100% self-consumption is the most economical alternative. On the other hand, profitability would not plummet due to excess yield,” said researcher Antti Kosonen.
A paper in Applied Energy, “Techno-economic viability of energy storage concepts combined with a residential solar photovoltaic system: A case study from Finland,” compared the profitability of PV systems operating under net metering with that of solar arrays connected to physical or virtual storage. The researchers found that selling surplus electricity to the network would be the most profitable option.
“(The) addition of a physical battery energy storage to the energy system was found to increase self-sufficiency from 20 to 30 percentage points for the houses under study,” the academics said. “The peak power capacity of the solar PV installation was observed to be a significant factor for determining the amount of self-sufficiency increase obtained by the use of a battery energy storage, with the increase being higher for larger solar PV installations.”
But given the current power price scenario in Finland, the deployment of lithium-ion batteries for residential applications is not yet economically feasible, they concluded.
“An increase in price for electricity import, of which the price of transmission is the most significant and prone to rise, would improve the profitability of an investment in a physical battery storage,” they said.

Mumbai-based Hinduja Group is one of the five new investors in UK-based Connected Energy, which develops commercial-scale stationary energy storage systems from used electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Hinduja Group, Caterpillar Venture Capital, Mercuria, OurCrowd, and Volvo Energy have together invested GBP 15 million ($18.4 million) in Connected Energy.
Connected Energy will use the funds to scale up its technology and operations in response to a growing energy storage market and increasing international availability of second-life batteries. The investment will also facilitate the in-house development of the company’s first large-scale M-STOR system of around 20 MW and 40 MWh. The system will feature a contracted “flow” of batteries from multiple original equipment manufacturers to provide long-term operational services to customers.
Connected Energy’s E-STOR technology is battery agnostic. It allows thousands of batteries with varying levels of degradation to be aggregated, controlled, and reused as one stationary energy storage system. It has 16 operational systems in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.
According to Connected Energy CEO Matthew Lumsden, when batteries are around 25% degraded, they are often considered unsuitable for vehicles. However, they still have sufficient capacity for up to 10 years of more use in battery energy storage systems (BESS). Over its lifetime in operation, a second-life BESS can save an additional 450 tons per MWh of CO2 equivalent compared to using first-life lithium-ion batteries.
“To grow the second-life battery industry, strong pan-value chain relationships will be critical to Connected Energy as it expands, and the company’s new investors will complement this effort,” said Lumsden.
Connected Energy is backed by Engie New Ventures, Macquarie, and the Low Carbon Innovation Fund.

India’s Natural Battery Technologies has started making lithium-ion inverter batteries for residential and commercial use. They also double as solar energy storage systems. The batteries use lithium ferro phosphate as the cathode material.
The manufacturer offers batteries in storage capacities ranging from 1.5 kWh to 20 kWh, but it can provide other sizes according to customer requirements. The operating voltage can be 12 V, 24 V, or 48 V, meeting the needs for low-scale applications. It can go up further in the case of bigger storage systems.
The batteries provide steady output ranging from 1 kVA to 50 kVA, which makes them ideal for use as uninterrupted power supply systems. They are safe to keep in any setting and can last up to 10 times longer than their lead-acid counterparts.
Natural Battery Technologies also provides integrated battery systems for both residential and commercial usage. The batteries are housed in separate cabinets – the kind typically used in larger energy storage applications. The company offers smaller 1 kVA to 10 kVA grid inverters in combination with solar energy storage systems. The maximum inverter output is around 240 V AC.

AES, Clearway Energy Group, Cypress Creek Renewables, and D. E. Shaw (DESRI), have formed the US Solar Buyer Consortium to support the expansion of the domestic solar supply chain and drive the growth of the US solar industry.
As a first step, the consortium launched a competitive request for proposal to search for qualified manufacturers who are aligned with the consortium’s goals and who can commit to a long-term strategic partnership to supply up to 7 GW of solar modules per year starting from 2024.
“Our group of companies comprise industry leaders that are committed to delivering cost-effective, renewable power for our customers. Our joint commitment to procure at this scale can provide the certainty suppliers need to ramp up capacity and overcome current supply chain constraints,” said David Zwillinger, CEO of DESRI.
Formation of the consortium follows the June 5 announcement by the US government of a 24-month tariff exemption on solar modules manufactured in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. The administration also invoked the Defense Production Act and said it is using the full power of federal procurement capabilities to boost US solar manufacturing.
A recent Wood Mackenzie report estimated that with supportive policies, an additional 20 GW of US manufacturing would be added. Earlier proposals of the Build Back Better Act contained significant incentives for solar modules, trackers, inverters, and more.
With the Build Back Better Act tabled, manufacturers hold out hope for the passage of Senator Jon Ossoff’s (D-Georgia) Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act,  which would offer tax credits for domestic manufacturing of modules, cells, and solar-grade polysilicon, as well as trackers and inverters. The incentives would be available through 2028 with a phase-down over the following two years.
The buying consortium hopes to encourage a stable, domestic supply chain for solar modules, which is sorely needed to get solar installations back on track. Increasing solar energy deployment is essential to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 C.
“Today’s announcement from the Consortium is just one step toward bolstering America’s solar supply chain,” said Craig Cornelius, CEO of Clearway Energy Group. “With legislation pending before Congress, policymakers can scale our domestic manufacturing workforce and restore our country’s legacy as a manufacturing leader. We appreciate the Biden administration’s commitment to invest in American workers and urge lawmakers to seize this opportunity.”

“Our modules are mainly used in external operations by the French army on containers in order to supply electricity to maintain temperature for ammunition, food rations, or medication,” Vincent Broha, an engineer for 2CA, told pv magazine. “The panels are also used to equip the canvases of command tents in external operations.”

The company claims that the frameless, self-supporting module is four times lighter than an equivalent glass-glass solar module.
“Thanks to six inserts in the panel, we can fix it on many surfaces without a frame and we can drill the panel at six points and fix it with screws and nuts,” the spokesperson said.
The new product is available in two versions – a 28-cell and a 60-cell configuration. The smaller Opérasol 28 BM panel has a power output of 130 W and a power conversion efficiency of 20.0%. Its open-circuit voltage is 18.6 V and its short-circuit current is 9.2 A. It measures 1,180 mm x 680 mm x 14 and weighs in at 3.4 kg. Its temperature coefficient is -0.37% per degree Celsius.

The larger Opérasol 60 BM panel measures 1,660 mm x 1,000 mm x 14 mm and weighs 6.3 kg. The efficiency and the temperature coefficient are the same as the 28-cell module and the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current are 40.0 V and 9.2 A, respectively.
“All panels are produced at our facility in Arlanc, in the Puy-de-Dôme department in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes in central France,” Broha said. “The warranty we offer varies from two to 10 years depending on the applications.”

The organization's “Africa Energy Outlook 2022” study anticipates oil and gas will continue to supply 85% of North Africa‘s energy in 2030. The IEA also said that cheap local coal will continue to dominate in South Africa at that point. The IEA report centers on a sustainable Africa scenario (SAS), which foresees the continent achieving all of its energy-related sustainable development goals on time by 2030.
A separate section of the 250-page study noted that one-fifth of Africa's liquefied natural gas facilities are at risk of coastal flooding. The IEA also found that almost 45% of the continent's residents who currently lack access to electricity would be better served by an expansion of national grids than by off-grid systems, with the latter only deployed in hard-to-reach locations, under the report's SAS model.
On the solar front, the document predicts a levelized cost of energy of $0.018/kWh to $0.049/kWh by 2030, cheaper than wind power or gas. That will mean the anticipated 125 GW of new solar generation capacity by 2030 would make up more than 40% of new power production capacity, the IEA predicted.
That figure is expected to include around 225 MW per year of solar minigrid capacity, from 2021 to 2030. Off-grid networks are set to dominate in nations such as Somalia, which have an almost non-existent power network.
For hydrogen, the three megatons (Mt) per year of unabated fossil fuel-based gas produced today could rise to more than 5 Mt by 2030. But only 15% of the latter figure would be what the IEA terms “low carbon,” a phrase which includes gas produced from fossil fuels fitted with carbon capture technology.
Hydrogen outlook
By the end of the decade, hydrogen could be produced in Africa for less than $2/kg, making it competitive with exports from the Middle East and southern Europe. The production figure would rise to 20 Mt by mid century, under the IEA scenario, with 80% of it “low carbon” by then.
The SAS model would generate 4 million energy-related jobs by 2030, the report stated, mostly to ensure universal access to electricity. But it would come at a price. The IEA said the average annual energy investment figure of $99 billion recorded in Africa from 2016 to 2020 would have to rise to $192 billion per year in the 2026 to 2030 period.
Achieving aims such as universal access to electricity will require an expansion in natural gas use, according to the IEA. Rising demand for domestically produced natural gas, much of it in currently unexploited reserves, would also take the edge off falls in export income for the fossil fuel as the rest of the world embraces the energy transition by 2030, the report stated. In addition, expansion of natural gas production would help Europe to wean itself off Russian gas, the Paris-based IEA noted.
