Israeli solar company Ellomay has connected to the grid the 300 MW Talasol PV project in Spain after 17 months of construction work.
Located in Talavan, in the province of Cáceres, in the country's southern region of Extremadura, the solar park is currently the third largest PV installation in Spain, after the 500 MW Núñez de Balboa solar plant owned by Iberdrola and the 493 MW Mula project owned by the Spanish industrial group Cobra.
Ellomay acquired Talasol Solar, a special purpose vehicle owning the project, for €10 million in May 2017.  In January 2018, the company secured a binding term sheet with an undisclosed international hedge for the projects. The company said the financial hedge will cover between 3.5 TWh and 3.7 TWh of power over a 10-year period, with the facility currently selling electricity on the spot market.
In September, the company said the project Capex was estimated at €240-260 million and that a 49% stake in the asset had been sold to unspecified investment funds. Financial closing for the project was achieved between the end of 2018 and March 2019.

The Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (Masen) has launched the second phase of the 400 MW PV tender it launched in January 2020.
The agency said it will now work closely with the pre-qualified bidders and will ensure their projects will be located at sites with suitable grid connection and infrastructure. The site selection takes into account a series of criteria including suitability for solar PV technology, accessibility, topography and environmental and social acceptability as well as the absence of competition with other economic activities.
These sites are located near Sidi Bennour, Kelaa Sraghna, Taroudant, Bejaad, El Hajeb and Ain Beni Mathar. The selected projects will be part of the first phase of the Noor PV II project, under which several PV arrays will be built across eight different locations.
Morocco intends to build at least 2 GW of generation capacity under the Noor Solar Plan. The country's energy strategy, launched in 2009, aims to increase the share of renewable energies in its electricity production capacity to 42% by 2020, and to 52% by 2030.

Germany deployed new PV systems totaling 480 MW in November according to the latest figures from the country's Federal Network Agency (the Bundesnetzagentur). This compares to 421 MW in October, 387.6 MW in September and 270.5 MW in November 2019.
In the first 11 months of 2020, 4.4 GW of new PV systems were registered by the Bundesnetzagentur, with cumulative installed PV capacity reaching 53.1 GW at the end of November. In the same period of 2019, new additions had totaled 3.6 GW.
The combined capacity of all PV systems not exceeding 750 kW in size, and installed last month, reached 383 MW. Of this capacity, around 30 MW is represented by small-sized solar parks built outside of the country's tender scheme for renewables.
As a result of this sustained growth, all the FITs for PV installations will be reduced by another 1.8% and will range from €0.0816-0.0622/kWh, depending on the system size.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/04/greece-plans-350-mw-solar-wind-tender-in-may-and-a-further-2-1-gw-to-2024/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,GREECE",ILIAS TSAGAS,"JANUARY 4, 2021",Greece plans 350 MW solar-wind tender in May and a further 2.1 GW to 2024,"Greece's Regulatory Authority for Energy (RAE) has announced the country’s third joint solar-wind tender will take place, on May 24.
Solar power projects with a generation capacity of up to 20 MW will be allocated, along with wind facilities up to 50 MW in a 350 MW procurement exercise which will have a €53.86/MWh (€0.05386/kWh) price ceiling for the energy generated.
Bidders hoping to compete in the auction must apply online by 5pm EET on March 22.
The tender is the third joint solar and wind power exercise, following April auctions in 2019 and 2020.
The May tender will be the first held under the country’s new digital license regime. The previous requirement to hold one of the limited number of generation licenses issued by the regulator has been removed, with the RAE now simply issuing an online generation certificate within 20 days of receipt of a €60 application fee from developers.
The previous regime had proved restrictive as the regulator was unable to process huge numbers of generation license applications.
The change brought in by environmental law 4685/2020 prompted a big response, with the RAE announcing just before Christmas that the first round of generation certificate applications had attracted 1,864 online applications related to 45.55 GW of potential renewables generation capacity – 1,286 of them relating to 36.34 GW of solar facilities.
Numerous contenders for the May auction now hold generation certificates, although they will still be required to also have a grid connection agreement and financial letters of guarantee.
The regulator is also expecting increased competition in the May tender. The RAE insists on over-subscription of its renewables tenders to meet competition requirements. The dearth of generation licenses available under the old regime meant that overbidding requirement was set at 40% – even so, tenders were routinely unable to achieve their capacity allocation targets.
The relative abundance of digital generation certificates has prompted the regulator to set a 100% over-subscription bar for the next procurement exercise.
The intent is that increased competition will bear down on the energy price tariffs allocated, to the benefit of electricity users.
Meanwhile, Greece’s Ministry of Energy and the Environment announced in November, the renewables tender program will be extended until 2024.
The exercise planned in May would actually have been the last tender planned under the 2018-20 clean energy procurement program but the ministry announced plans for a further six solar-wind auctions up to 2024, each aiming to allocate 350 MW of renewables generation capacity.
The government department also stated, in a press release about the tender schedule, that the program would be fine tuned in the months ahead to better match a new electricity market design introduced at the end of last year.
Prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis today made Kostas Skrekas minister for energy and the environment in a cabinet reshuffle. Skrekas will replace Kostis Hatzidakis, who was responsible for introducing the digital renewables licensing process and a more comprehensive environmental licensing scheme. Hatzidakis was a strong proponent of the new electricity market design, which is based on EU guidelines, and Skrekas is expected to continue in the same direction.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/04/enhancing-electron-transfer-kinetics-crucial-for-viability-of-redox-flow-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 4, 2021",Enhancing electron transfer kinetics crucial for viability of redox flow batteries,"A group of scientists from the University of Pittsburgh, in the United States, has analyzed challenges and opportunities for the commercial viability of redox flow batteries (RFBs) and has identified the kinetics of electron transfer between electrolytes and electrodes in the charge-discharge stack as the crucial factor for their success.
In the paper Harnessing Interfacial Electron Transfer in Redox Flow Batteries, published in Joule, the researchers explained that vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), which are currently being considered as the most mature and popular RFB technology due to their advanced electrolyte chemistry, have still too-high costs for vanadium precursors and stack components and that, as a result, the research on RFBs has recently refocused on the electrolyte design. “Significant interest is currently centered on organic and organometallic redox couples, due in part to the ability to tune key physicochemical properties such as reduction potential and solubility,” the academics explained. “These electrolytes have shown excellent promise in laboratory studies and are undergoing initial deployment in early-stage commercial devices.”
Efficiency, lifetime, and cost, according to the research team, are the three key factors that must be considered in evaluating the performance of RFBs and their ability to compete with lithium-ion technologies. In terms of efficiency, it went on to say, vanadium redox flow devices have so far shown they can operate at high efficiencies only when operating at low power densities. This trade-off between efficiency and power density is due to kinetic limitations in vanadium redox couples and transport limitations in membrane separators.
Redox flow batteries that are not based on vanadium could represent a cheaper and more efficient alternative due to their lower electrolyte and stack costs. “System cost is often touted as a major advantage for RFBs over established secondary batteries such as li-ion in grid scale energy storage,” the U.S. group stated. “This primarily results from the fact that increasing the capacity of a flow battery simply requires the use of more electrolyte.”
Interfacial electron transfer kinetics is pointed out as the key factor that influences voltage efficiencies in RFBs, which is in turn responsible for lower round-trip energy-conversion efficiencies compared to solid-state storage. “Understanding, and ultimately controlling interfacial electron transfer in RFBs fundamentally depends on the ability to accurately measure reaction rates as a function of applied potential and to interpret the results in the context of RFB operation,” the scientists highlighted, adding that high-quality electroanalysis for RFB performance and robust characterization methods for RFB active materials are needed to help future research gain insight in this matter.
Furthermore, the research team believes that the performance of redox flow storage may be improved by relying on design strategies adopted from electrochemical catalysis or by designing electrolytes with organic and organometallic molecules that exhibit inherently fast, outer-sphere electron transfer reactions, although both techniques are described as suffering from several key constraints. “Research in RFBs will also greatly benefit from a deeper understanding of kinetic stabilization strategies to increase cell voltage,” the academics added. “These will likely be necessary for non-aqueous RFBs that are as stable as li-ion batteries, and they may be equally useful for aqueous systems.”

With more than 100 garment factories certified green by the U.S. Green Building Council in recent years, more than 500 facilities have registered to make their manufacturing operations more environmentally friendly.
“We have set up green factories and the number of such facilities is increasing,” said Rubana Huq, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA). “Rooftop solar will ease our endeavor to set up green industry.”
With Bangladesh the second largest apparel exporter in the world, the nation hosts more than 4,000 garment factories, scores of which already feature rooftop solar after the introduction of net metering rules. A 3.1 MW system across multiple rooftops owned by the Robintex Group in Narayanganj district and a 2.46 MW facility at Dhaka's Basundhara Industrial Complex are among the commercial and industrial arrays which have already been installed.
“Yes, we will ask BGMEA members to set up solar system[s on] building rooftop[s] under [the] net metering facility,” Huq told pv magazine. Asked whether government assistance would be necessary, Huq said: “Incentivising green growth is a key to sustainability.” The state-run Infrastructure Development Company Limited provides low cost loans for rooftop solar.
Businesses able to install their own solar arrays can generate rooftop electricity for as little as $0.037/kWh, according to the nation's Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA). By leasing rooftops under the net metering regime, using the operating expenditure (opex) model, companies can reduce their electricity costs by $0.012/kWh, compared to state utility prices.
“We all need to install rooftop solar to get electricity at low cost and to lower [the] burning [of] fossil fuel,” said Abdus Salam Murshedy, MD of platinum-certified green garment factory owner Envoy Textiles Ltd.
Some 1,167 solar rooftops in Bangladesh generate 17.13 MW of electricity under the net metering regime, according to SREDA.

The consultant reported the annual energy working meeting held by state body the National Energy Administration (NEA) last month stated it would consider gunning for the 120 GW figure this year, in the wake of a pledge by president Xi Jinping in mid December to achieve 1.2 TW of renewables generation facilities this decade.
However, even if the NEA adopts a 120 GW target – perhaps as part of the next, 2021-25 five-year plan – it is unlikely to achieve the ambition, according to the AECEA, which has offered 45-50 GW as its initial guesstimate of how much solar will be added in China this year.
An update issued by the AECEA this morning stated the president's 2030 announcement had caused the Chinese renewables industry to get “carried away.” The analyst pointed to the warning issued by the State Grid Corporation of China nine months ago that only 48.45 GW of new solar project capacity, and 36.65 GW of wind could be accommodated on its network during 2020. The “up to 15” long-distance, ultra-high-voltage DC power lines which are under construction to alleviate capacity constraints will not enter service until at least 2022-23, according to the AECEA.
The world's solar capital experienced its usual end-of-year installation rush last month, according to the consultant, with official NEA figures expected this month to confirm up to 40 GW of new solar was added last year, with 14-15 GW coming online last month and November predicted to have seen 3.49 GW of the year's remarkable 10.1 GW of new residential arrays. That anticipated rooftop rush in November will have been helped by the “buffer month” guarantee to honor subsidies for household systems despite the fact the annual RMB500 million ($77.4 million) budget had been almost exhausted during October.
Notably, the NEA is considering extending the household solar subsidy program this year and city authorities in Beijing, Shanghai, Xian and Guangzhou last month issued supportive policies for such arrays out to 2025.
If an annual figure of around 40 GW of new solar is confirmed for 2020, China would have reached 245 GW four days ago, obliterating the current five-year-plan target of 105 GW, according to the AECEA.
Guizhou is expected to have added 5.2 GW of solar capacity last year, to retain its top position, and the 4.57 GW of rooftop solar expected to have been added in Shandong, plus 4.1 GW in greater Hebei, are expected to have accounted for the lion's share of new household PV.
If those figures are borne out, the 1.2 TW renewables ambition announced by President Xi would require 72 GW of new wind and solar annually this decade, a figure which is already expected to have been beaten by around 18% last year. The AECEA stated the National Energy Administration has a 50 GW renewables pipeline plus plans for a “reserve capacity” of around 40 GW in the form of more than 20 clean-energy mega-projects. The consultant added, state utilities are aiming to install 175-200 GW of renewables by 2025.

The starting price for MK KazSilicon LLP has been set at KZT707 million ($1.68 million). This company operates a solar grade metallurgical silicon factory with a capacity of 5,000 tons per year in Ushtobe.
As for Kazakhstan Solar Silicon LLP, which owns a 60 MW wafer manufacturing facility in Ust-Kamenogorsk, the starting price has been set at KZT5,59 billion. The starting price for Astana Solar LLP has been set at KZT3.38 billion. This unit produces polycrystalline solar cells and modules and operates a 50 MW manufacturing facility in Astana.
The units were created with the support of a French consortium led by government-run atomic energy agency the CEA and were formed with fully integrated PV manufacturing lines.
Kazatomprom sought to sell the three companies through a first auction launched in September 2017. Later, in May 2019, it announced that a 75% stake in the three units had been sold to an international consortium formed by the Yadran Solar unit of Russian oil provider Yadran Oil; France’s ECM Greentech, which manufactures turnkey production lines for the PV industry; and China’s Kasen/Canadian Solar. At the time, Kazatomprom said, under the terms of the agreement, the remaining 25% stake would be acquired by the consortium within three years.
In its latest financial results, however, the company revealed that this agreement did not enter into force due to “non-compliance by the purchaser with certain conditions.”

The Senegalese government is targeting to reach universal access to electricity by 2025. This is expected to be achieved by expanding the existing power grid and adding around 180 MW of off-grid generation capacity. Around 88% of the interested remote villages will be electrified through the grid expansion.
In order to support the development of off-grid solar, the Senegalese government introduced in September a VAT exemption for PV products when connected to an off-grid project.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency, Senegal had an installed PV capacity of 134 MW at the end of 2019. Most of this capacity comes from grid-connected large scale PV.

The regulator assigned 608.95 MW of PV capacity across 33 projects submitted by seven developers. Israel-based companies Doral Group Renewable Energy Resources LTD and SoleGreen secured 200 MW and 95.6 MW capacity allotments, respectively.
EDF Energies Nouvelles Israel LTD, the Israeli unit of French energy giant EDF, was awarded projects totaling 90 MW and Israel-headquartered Enlight Renewable Energy secured 82 MW. Furthermore, Tel Aviv-based independent power producer Energix Renewable Energies Ltd and Israeli company Meshakim & Partners were assigned 80 MW and 40 MW of PV capacity, respectively. The remaining 21.35 MW was secured by Israel's infrastructure and real estate company Shikun & Binui.
The projects will sell power at a final price of ILS0.1745/kWh ($0.0544) and will have to begin delivering power to the Israeli grid by July 2023. A storage capacity of around 2,400 MWh will be linked to the selected solar power projects.
The regulator had pre-qualified 10 bidders with proposals for 55 projects with a total of 870 MW of capacity.
“Israel is a young PV market, launched in 2009,” the director of Israel's Green Energy Association, Eitan Parnass, told pv magazine. “For many years, the government has delayed implementation aiming to avoid subsidies, but in the past three years things have changed.” According to him, the government is now pushing for Israel to become a leader of solar PV.  “A lot will have to be done to get there, but the impressive quantities and results prove the seriousness of both the government and the local PV industry,” Parnass also stated.
In the first tender of the same kind, finalized in mid-July, the Electricity Market Regulatory Authority assigned 168 MW of capacity. This auction concluded with a final price of ILS0.1990/kWh.
The nation supports PV through tenders for large scale projects and operates an incentive scheme for rooftop PV, offering feed-in tariffs.
The government approved in October a plan submitted by energy minister Yuval Steinitz to deploy around 15 GW more solar capacity to help raise the 2030 target for the proportion of national electricity drawn from renewables from 17% to 30%. The new ILS80 billion ($23 billion) plan will add to the new energy and water infrastructure plan announced in late April, to help the country’s economy recover from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Between Christmas and New Year, South Australia got another glimpse of its 100% renewably powered future, when solar and wind generation made up 99.6% of electricity in the grid on December 27, as tracked by OpenNEM.
Although much of the affected population was in Christmas recovery at the time, PV technology consultant Pierre Verlinden, a former VP and Chief Scientist at Trina Solar in China, but now based back in South Australia’s McLaren Vale, posted the moment on LinkedIn and began answering questions from the worldwide clean-energy-interested community.

He noted that South Australia has seen a steady increase in the penetration of renewables over the past 13 years, with an absolute increase of 4.5% per annum, leading to an average contribution of renewable generation over 2020 of 59%.
Therefore, he extrapolated, “I would expect 63.5% in 2021 and 100% by 2030.”
AEMO’s South Australian Electricity Report for the financial year 2019/2020, released in November, attributed 42.9% of the 59.6% renewable penetration in South Australia to wind generation, and 15.7% to solar generation (11.6% rooftop).
As Verlinden says, “The keys to 100% renewables is a good combination of diversity of sources, storage and interconnection of the network.”
So although the renewable contribution in the state so far is stellar by world standards — and for an hour on October 11 solar generation actually supplied 100% of South Australia’s electricity — diversification of renewable sources and stronger interconnection with the rest of the National Electricity Market are necessary further developments on the road to continuous 100% generation.
“The good characteristics of South Australia are that there is very good decoupling of wind and solar PV,” wrote Verlinden on LinkedIn, who contrasted the resources with those of California, “where wind energy is very much synchronous with solar”.
Nonetheless, rampaging solar generation, which the South Australian Electricity Report documented as increasing by 35% from the financial year 2018/19, has caused daytime meltdowns when supply outstrips demand, such that the state government saw it necessary to rush in regulations to allow centralized disconnection of rooftop supply to support grid stability.
Ultimately, the flexible autonomous control by inverters of rooftop-solar exports to the grid will allow a more balanced supply-demand scenario, and an ARENA-funded trial is currently underway — involving SA Power Networks, SwitchDin smart software solutions and Fronius, SMA and SolarEdge inverter manufacturers — to test and hopefully scale such a system, which would enable continued connection of rooftop solar systems sized to suit the householder, not the limitations of the network.
Verlinden also refers to the stabilizing influence of batteries: notably South Australia’s 150 MW Hornsdale Power Reserve, which since its first 100 MW stage was connected to the grid in 2017, has responded to major system outages and helped the network surf variability in renewable supply.
Residential and commercial batteries, especially when linked to smart energy-flow controllers capable of responding to grid signals, will also help smooth network supply and demand.
“Currently,” notes Verlinden, “the state is using a minimum of 200 MW of continuous gas-powered source to maintain the grid voltage, and a back of ~1,500 MW of gas-powered generators.”
Interestingly, South Australia’s existing connection to the long arm of the NEM has facilitated exports to other states equal to 2.8% of generation, so the state actually generated renewable energy equal to 61.3% of its consumption.
On the subject of interconnection, 2020 saw Project EnergyConnect, a long-planned 875-kilometer transmission line between South Australia and New South Wales, clear another regulatory hurdle in the required several-year process to delivery.
Should the $2.5 billion project go ahead, and not be overtaken by a conga line of batteries delivering virtual transmission, or pipelines of renewable hydrogen — it is taking so long that such eventualities are not totally in the realm of the ridiculous — it will enable still greater resilience to South Australia’s variable renewable generation allowing supply and demand to be distributed across different geographic regions, and a wider range of renewable generation and storage projects including Snowy 2.0.
At the start of this new year, South Australia, says Verlinden, still has a “very weak” interconnection with other states and no renewable-energy sources besides prodigious wind and growing solar (that’s discounting a 3 MW dribble of hydroelectric capacity provided by SA Water’s Terminal Storage Mini Hydro system at Tea Tree Gully).
In short, he writes, “the transformation of the energy economy is far from finished”.
