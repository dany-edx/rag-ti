The new solution is said to provide the lowest delivered cost for hydrogen fueling,  as well as up to 2,300 kg/day of hydrogen production, which is equivalent to 38 MWh of usable energy, in a 40-foot, movable containerized solution. It can be islanded or grid-connected, with no risk of battery thermal runaway and a small volume of hydrogen stored on site. The system integrates KCE’s hydrogen generator, ZincFive’s immediate power nickel-zinc batteries, and fuel cells from Power Cell to offer customers modular, scalable economic fueling as a service. Robert Meaney, co-founder of KCE, told pv magazine that the energy input comes from methanol. He said the system is essentially the clean version of a diesel generator. It uses the ZincFive battery for immediate demand response as the methanol-to-hydrogen system ramps up to full production over the first 15 minutes. After entering full production mode, the batteries shut off and the reformer takes over the full power demand. The system is charger agnostic and can support multiple DC fast chargers at once. KCE has started accepting pre-orders and plans to deploy a 20-foot, 150 kW solution with pilot customers in the fourth quarter of 2022.
Lightyear has launched the final design of its long-range, production-ready solar car. The model, which has been renamed “Lightyear 0,” has a Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) range of 625 kilometers and consumption of 10.5 kWh per 100 kilometers.  However, the Dutch startup claims that a theoretical range of 695 kilometers could be achieved, with a battery pack capacity of 60 kWh. “The optimized solar roof and holistic design mean that the car can drive for weeks, even months, without charging,” the company said. Lightyear is already readying its second solar electric car, which will be available by late 2024 or early 2025.
European Union lawmakers have upheld plans to ban combustion engines in new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles from 2035, while moving closer to forcing carmakers to stop selling gasoline-powered cars. Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) support the corresponding proposal of the EU Commission. Specifically, car manufacturers must reduce their average fleet emissions by 15% by 2025, by 55% by 2030 and by 100% by 2035. Synthetic fuels will not be exempt from the ban. “An ambitious revision of CO2-standards is a crucial part of reaching our climate targets,” said Dutch MEP Jan Huitema, who had introduced the draft. “With these standards, we are creating clarity for the car industry and can stimulate innovation and investments for car manufacturers.” EU member states will have their say in the coming weeks before a final agreement on tougher emission requirements is approved.
Ferrari is reportedly looking to expand its factory in northern Italy as part of its electrification strategy, scheduled for release next week. According to BloombergNEF, the Italian luxury car manufacturer has bought space near its Maranello plant and has started clearing the way for a third production line that will be dedicated to making hybrid and electric vehicles. The expansion will likely include a new battery R&D center, according to unidentified sources. Ferrari is expected to launch its first purely electric vehicle in 2025.
Nio said that in 2024 it will start making high-voltage battery packs. The Chinese EV maker has developed them on its own, as part of a drive to improve profitability and competitiveness. It will start producing an 800-volt battery pack, which recharges faster than 400-volt batteries present in most EVs on the market today. The self-produced batteries will be used in its new mass-market models, which should be ready for sale in the second half of 2024. Like Tesla, Nio plans to use a combination of self-produced and externally sourced batteries over the long run.
Nano One and Rio Tinto have announced a strategic partnership to provide iron and lithium products, and a $10 million investment in Nano One that equals to 4.9% of the company shares. The partnership and funding are expected to accelerate Nano One’s multi-cathode commercialization strategy and support the production of active cathode materials in Canada. The Canadian battery developer's patented One Pot Process and metal-to-cathode active material (M2CAM) technologies form a unique manufacturing platform. It enables nickel-rich (NMC), iron-rich (LFP) and manganese-rich (LNMO) lithium-ion cathode active materials to be made sulfate-free from a range of battery metal sources with fewer steps, lower costs, less complexity, and a smaller environmental footprint. The tech applies to all lithium-ion battery chemistries for applications in electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, and portable electronics.
Siemens has acquired a minority stake in wireless charging specialist WiTricity for $25 million. The two companies seek to bridge gaps in the global standardization of wireless charging for electric passenger and light duty commercial vehicles, to enable interoperability between vehicles and infrastructure, as well as support market penetration. In addition, they will collaborate on wireless charging systems.
The United Arab Emirates Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, meanwhile, also selected Siemens to set up a nationwide network of ultra-fast charging stations for electric vehicles. Ten Siemens Sicharge D 160 kW and 180 kW charging stations will be installed along the highways in Ras Al Khaimah, Ajman, Umm al-Quwain and Fujairah. To meet changing market demand, the chargers have a scalable power of up to 300 kW and can be expanded with additional external dispensers for up to two additional charging cables. All of them are cloud-connected devices that allow for remote monitoring and management.

“We have set a world record in hydrogen combustion in micro gas turbines. No one has been able to produce at this level before,” said the research project's coordinator, Mohsen Assadi.
The gas turbine generates heat and electricity, while also providing hot water for some laboratory buildings in the immediate area.
“In addition, surplus energy is supplied to power provider Lyse's district heating and electricity grids,” the university said in a statement. “The goal is to produce electricity with zero CO2 emissions.”
The scientists acknowledged that the turbine has a slightly lower efficiency when it is operated exclusively with pure hydrogen. However, they also noted the advantages of using the green fuel without the need to build new infrastructure.
“First, a certain effort is required to ensure that existing gas infrastructure can handle hydrogen instead of natural gas,” they explained. “Second, this is about technology for energy conversion, that is, the turbine technology itself.”
The German Aerospace Center (DLR) has partnered with the university on the project. It has provided a special combustion chamber for the micro gas turbine plant.
“We have contributed to technological adaptations of the fuel system and combustion chamber technology,” said Assadi
Looking forward, the researchers said they plan to investigate the limitations of the gas plant for hydrogen use, as well as ways to increase capacity.

(NTT), to use grid-scale battery storage to reduce the impact of solar curtailment on the island of Kyushu, in southern Japan.
“By spring 2022, solar power curtailment has been carried out in Kyushu region, where solar power spreads even earlier in Japan,” Mitsubishi said in a statement. “Solar power curtailment has been carried out in several regions other than Kyushu, such as Shikoku, Chugoku and Tohoku area in Japan.”
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) issued its first “Power Crunch Alert” for the Tokyo Region in mid-March, after an earthquake hit the area.
“Under these unstable circumstances, effective utilization of excessive electricity should be one of the essential ways to secure stable power supply,” Mitsubishi explained. “Considering the situation, we have agreed into collaboration to establish a business model to utilize grid-scale battery storage for restriction of solar power curtailment and trading electricity in various electricity markets.”
The three companies plan to use grid-scale battery storage installed by NTTAE, in order to effectively use excess power and stabilize power supplies. The first 4.2 MWh facility will be deployed in Fukuoka and is expected to begin commercial operations in February 2023.
According to Japan's Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies (ISEP), the island of Kyushu had around 10.5 GW of PV and 600 MW of wind capacity installed under the country's feed-in scheme by the end of 2021. The curtailment rate in the region for the entire year was estimated at around 4.4%, up from 3.8% in the preceding year.
“In addition, about 4 GW of nuclear power generation is in operation at any given time, and the VRE output curtailment is also greatly affected by the operation of these nuclear power plants,” said ISEP.
The energy sources are curtailed on the island in the following order of prioritization: thermal, biomass, solar and wind, hydroelectric, nuclear, and geothermal.
“The use of pumped hydro storage and storage batteries is effective, but further promotion and optimization of online control of VRE, review of the minimum output of thermal power generation, demand response and virtual power plants are required,” said ISEP.

EDF Renewable North America has won contracts for three solar projects with co-located energy storage from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA).
The projects represent nearly 40% of the 2.4 GW awarded as part of NYSERDA’s 2020 Renewable Energy Standard Solicitation, and 170 MW of the capacity was awarded as part of the 2018 solicitation.
All three projects are expected to reach commercial operations by the end of 2025. The awarded projects are as follows:
EDF Renewables is among the largest developers of renewable energy in North America, with 24 GW of solar, storage, and wind projects across the continent. About 70% of the company’s project pipeline is solar. To date, it has installed 187 MW of solar and 80 MW of wind in New York state.
NYSERDA’s 2020 clean energy solicitation program includes 22 new large-scale renewable energy generation sites, over 3,000 jobs created, and nearly $3 billion in direct investment. In total, the reduced carbon emissions is expected to be equivalent to taking 440,000 cars off the road annually.
Under the program, NYSERDA supports new project development, and the program creates an obligation for retail electricity suppliers, such as energy service companies, to purchase increasing amounts of renewable energy to supply their customers. The NYSERDA program is in pursuit of a 2030 target of 70% of the state’s electricity to come from renewable energy sources, and 100% zero-emissions electricity by 2040.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/13/perovksite-solar-cell-with-23-13-efficiency-via-new-passivation-approach/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 13, 2022",Perovksite solar cell with 23.13% efficiency via new passivation approach,"Australian researchers have developed a perovskite solar cell with a novel passivation process based on the use of guanidinium (Gua) and octylammonium (Oa) spacer cations.
They claim that guanidinium salts can improve the performance of the perovskite film, as guanidinium ions are capable of penetrating into the bulk of the perovskite material and localizing at the grain boundaries (GBs).
“We designed the cells to be used in small-scale residential solar systems or large-scale solar power plants,” researcher The Duong told pv magazine. “Significantly, the perovskite solar cell technology can be combined with the existing silicon solar cell technology in a tandem configuration to achieve ultrahigh efficiency of up to 30%.”
The research group used guanidinium bromide (GuaBr) and octylammonium bromide (OABr) for the cations, which purportedly outperform their monospace cation counterparts in terms of short-circuit current density, power conversion efficiency, and thermal stability. The passivation layers were embedded on the hole transport layer (HTL) side at the HTL/perovskite interface.
“To optimize the ratio between GuaBr and OABr components, three different volume ratios of 1:1 (termed as 1G-1O), 1:2 (named as 1G-2O), and 2:1 (referred to as 2G-1O) were examined,” the team said. “After spin coating the 3D perovskite precursor solution on the substrate and annealing it on a hotplate at 100 C for 30 minutes, the passivation solution is spun on the substrate, followed by another annealing at 100 C for 10 minutes.”
The 1G-1O cell sample achieved an average open-circuit voltage of of 1.2V, which is 30 mV higher than that of a reference cell without the new cations. This indicates a reduction in nonradiative recombination, according to the researchers.
“With dual-cation passivation layer, the efficiency increased from 21.37% for the control cell to 23.13% for the passivated device, along with much improved shelf-life stability.” they said. “In addition, in light soaking stability, test device 1G-1O maintained over 97% of its initial efficiency after 60 hours.”
They described the novel passivation approach in “Above 23% Efficiency by Binary Surface Passivation of Perovskite Solar Cells Using Guanidinium and Octylammonium Spacer Cations,” which was recently published in RRL Solar. The research group includes scientists from Flinders University, the University of New South Wales, and Australian National University.
“Further enhancement in cell performance and stability may be able to be achieved by exploring other combinations of various spacer cations as the surface passivation layer,” the team said, referring to their future work on the cell.

“We have succeeded in the development of a water heater powered by hydrogen, which is sought after as a clean fuel source with zero CO2 emissions, in a way that addresses the issues of explosion risk and combustion stability,” it said, adding that the heater can be used for residential applications.
Rinnai is currently using the hydrogen water heater in demonstration projects in Australia, prior to commercialization.
“We will develop our products in countries where hydrogen will be quickly available,” the company said. “This latest breakthrough will be an absolute game-changer, both for our business and for the wider gas industry. It will mark the beginning of bringing proven household appliances that can run on 100% renewable gas to market.”
In the past, Rinnai has developed a gas water heater that can operate with 20% hydrogen or methane blending. It also recently tested tankless water heaters that can work with 30% hydrogen or methane blending, without the need for product upgrades or modifications.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/13/albania-approves-first-unsubsidized-large-scale-solar-projects/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,ALBANIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 13, 2022",Albania approves first unsubsidized large-scale solar projects,"Albanian Minister of Infrastructure and Energy Belinda Balluku said last week that the government has approved two unsubsidized PV projects with capacities of 20 MW each.
The plants, which will be built in the Korça region, will help local energy consumers to reduce their energy bills through power purchase agreements (PPAs). Around 2% of the energy from the two facilities will be supplied to public entities for free, as a payment for the land lease the government is awarding to the two unspecified developers.
Balluku did not reveal any additional technical and financial details about the two projects.
“These new investments are in line with the priority given by the government of Albania by the end of 2021 of the solar sector,” Albanian energy lawyer Lorenc Gordani told pv magazine. “The latest data shows there are 1.2 GW in the pipeline in the solar power sector and, according to preliminary zoned studies, there is currently in total untapped technical potential for deploying solar projects up to 2,378 MW, available with a low capital cost.”
The Albanian government has also decided that renewable energy plant operators will now have to pay for grid imbalances as conventional power producers. Such costs were previously covered by the nation's public utility, Korporata Elektroenergjitike Shqiptare Sh.a (KESH), and other state entities.
Albania currently subsidizes large-scale PV through a series of tenders. It also supports rooftop PV through a net-metering scheme. According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the country's cumulative installed PV capacity stood at just 22 MW at the end of 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/13/dutch-agency-probing-payments-for-surplus-solar-power/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 13, 2022",Dutch agency probing payments for surplus solar power,"The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) is now investigating whether energy suppliers are buying surplus solar power from prosumers under the nation's net-metering regime at lower tariffs than what is considered a “reasonable price,” according to Minister for Climate and Energy Rob Jetten.
Jetten made the comments last week in response to a parliamentary inquiry into Consumentenbond, a Dutch non-profit organization that promotes consumer protection. Jetten said a reasonable minimum net-metering fee for surplus solar energy would be at least 80% of the energy price that prosumers pay to buy power from the grid, minus taxes. He added that the introduction of new net-metering rules in the future could help to identify a lower limit for such tariffs, which would in turn bring more certainty to the Dutch residential PV market.
“This is partly the result of increasing negative prices in the market, mostly due to the high solar generation peaks in the middle of the day,” Dutch solar analyst Peter Segaar told pv magazine. “This means that energy providers also have risks and, at the same time, have to keep up a profitable business case in relation to solar power generation from residential customers.”
According to the most recent statistics from the Dutch Central Agency for Statistics (CBS), at the end of 2021 there were around 1.58 million Dutch households that were equipped with rooftop PV systems. And this is why big protests could erupt if a solution to the current tariff uncertainty is not provided soon.
“Now we expect the ACM to do its job, which is monitoring the tariffs,” Segaar said. “So far, however, we haven't seen anything in this regard.”
The country's cumulative installed PV capacity stood at 14.3 GW at the end of 2021, according to the CBS. The Dutch solar market grew by 3.3 GW last year. By comparison, new PV capacity additions hit 2.93 GW in 2020, 2.57 GW in 2019, 1.69 GW in 2018, and 853 MW in 2017.
