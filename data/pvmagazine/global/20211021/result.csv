One of the biggest predictions made in the 2021 report, published this week, is that the falling costs of renewable energy technologies, combined with stronger climate policies, “will result in carbon emissions in line with a 2°C pathway. Stopping global warming at 1.5°C, however, will require a substantial increase in both political ambition and pace of global action.” 
And yet, that “2°C pathway” still requires more than twice as much solar and wind installation every year up to 2050. The report was launched at an event at Statkraft's central London office attended by leaders in climate policy, including economist and author of the Green New Deal, Ann Pettifor, and former RenewableUK CEO Hugh McNeal. 
“There's so much more we need to do,” said Pettifor, “and given the latest and disappointing government net zero strategy announcement, it is clear the political will required to make the transformation here (UK) and in the US still does not exist. The delusion persists that the private sector can undertake this transformation. The private sector is largely risk averse…This is about changing the very dominant economic debate, which is that society must rely on private capital markets to allocate resources for transforming energy”.

“The world has been called to arms,” said Statkraft CEO Christian Rynning-Tønnesen, “to work in unison to slow the warming of our planet. It's the mission of a lifetime, one that will define our generation. With the world slowly re-opening, so too are emissions returning to pre-pandemic levels, reinforcing our belief that the only way towards a 1.5-degree path is through the energy transition.”
Despite the economic hit from the Covid-19 pandemic, Statkraft saw green investment increase by 7% in 2020, a result of the fact that renewable energies are already cheaper than fossil fuels when it comes to new capacity in most markets. “In general, for one euro invested in solar PV and wind today you get around four times the output compared to what you did ten years ago.” 
For that reason, Statkraft predicts that between now and 2050, solar capacity will grow by a factor of 21, and wind by a factor of seven. By 2050, solar will meet approximately two-thirds of global energy demand. And the world will need it, considering power demand is set to more than double in the same period.


The report predicts that solar power capacity will increase by 10% annually, on average, every year up to 2050, to almost 13,000 GW. And Statkraft retains its 2020 report prediction that “solar production will surpass wind power, hydropower, coal power and gas power, and will be the largest source of power from around 2035.” 

Of course, to achieve these kinds of capacity numbers, an enormous electrification of global energy systems needs to take place, with Statkraft predicting “the share of electricity in final global energy demand will more than double to reach 47% in 2050.” 
“Development is happening fast,” continued Rynning-Tønnesen, “but it needs to go even faster…During the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, a time when our lives were upended and we lived in lockdown, we experienced a 6% drop in CO2 emissions. That's the very amount that we must reduce year-on-year towards 2050, if we are to reach the Paris Agreement's target of 1.5 degrees.”
Since 2012, green energy jobs have increased by nearly 60%, and in the solar energy sector the numbers have actually tripled. By 2050, Statkraft predicts those numbers will quadruple, a prediction in line with the International Renewable Energy Agency's (IRENA) figure of about a 30 million green job increase by 2050, with around 60% of those jobs seen in Asia. 

Statkraft's report forecasts that green hydrogen will provide 9.6% of global power in 2050, and more than 20% in Europe. However, before this can happen the cost of green hydrogen needs to come down. The major cost component of hydrogen is, of course, electrolyzers, but Statkraft forecasts a 60% fall in the price of electrolyzers by 2050, a steady decline considering electrolyzers have fallen by 60% over just the last five years. 

By 2050, Statkraft predicts Europe's demand for green hydrogen will increase anywhere from 20-25%, corresponding to approximately 1,000 TWh. But the report points out that cooperation between nations, both inside and outside the EU, is integral to making green hydrogen production more affordable.

Though standards are emerging to simplify this process, there remain two wafer formats on the market – 182mm and 210mm – and significant differences between PV modules based on the two. These two formats have divided the manufacturing, with both enjoying backing from major players. And while there is likely space in the market for both formats for the time being, gaining a better understanding of how each performs in the field, and the further optimizations that might be needed to get the most out of this new generation of larger modules.
Longi Solar Technology, currently the largest module maker in the world by production capacity, and a key backer of the smaller 182mm wafer format, engaged energy consultancy DNV to conduct a cost comparison for the balance of systems components in three different layouts, and testing 72 cell modules based on the 182mm wafer against 55 and 60 cell modules built with the larger 210mm format.
All modules in the comparison used half-cut cell and multi busbar interconnection. The following table shows the power ratings, dimensions and other characteristics of the modules in the comparison.

MBB
The modules were tested on single axis trackers, two-in-portait fixed tilt, and four-in-landscape racking systems. DNV produced cost calculations for each based on its own experience as well as quotes from equipment suppliers, industry research and ‘typical cost’ estimates for specific parameters provided by market research firm Wood Mackenzie.
For each scenario, DNV made calculations based on a 3.7 MW system located on a flat, rectangular piece of land in Texas. Central inverters were used for the comparison, and number of modules per string calculated based on the maximum voltage of the modules and the inverter.
In all three scenarios, the 182mm module pencilled out at a balance of systems cost slightly lower than the 210mm modules. The cost calculations are provided in the table below.
DNV downplayed the differences in cost between each scenario. “There is little variation in overall prices within each scenario, meaning the module choice has little effect, but it can be seen that certain racking configurations lead to different overall prices,” the company stated, noting that the variation in two string versus three string trackers did produce a noticeable cost difference.
Longi, meanwhile, was keen to note the positive result 182mm products “…under fair and practical boundary conditions of module power, capacity ratio, racking length, selection of electrical equipment and manual installation costs,” reads a statement from the company reviewing the results of the comparison, “the adoption of over-sized modules with an ultra-high current does not show advantage in BOS cost savings than 182-72c modules, as module efficiency is still the critical factor in BOS costs.”
Longi went on to state that DNV’s comparison only takes in BOS costs on the DC; and that there could be further savings possible in the AC system and grid connections lines. “In reality, in the case of large power plants, land resources will usually be fully utilized to maximize installation capacity, meaning that 182 modules will represent a larger capacity (about 2 ~ 3%) with higher module efficiency,” Longi’s statement concludes. “[this means] potentially saving on project development cost per watt and costs arising from booster stations and outgoing utility lines on the AC side, further strengthening the 182 module's potential superiority in overall value.”

Chris has also served as an advisory board member at Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA).
Chris Pennington (CP): When there was very little renewable energy on the grid all new renewable energy was beneficial towards reducing grid costs and emissions. But as the percentage of generation from renewable sources increases it will continue to become more and more important that we're aware of where and when renewable power is placed onto the grid in order to maximize impact. We've adopted the 24/7 carbon free energy goal in part because it draws awareness to the importance of knowing where power comes from and how it is consumed, each hour of every day. As more companies consider this goal and commit to knowing their hourly renewable usage, we will collectively become more impactful in decarbonizing the grid.

Tracking energy usage hourly will naturally identify the hours underserved by carbon free sources, and enable focused innovation towards solving these gaps in renewable supply. We're already seeing that in many cases the duration of unmatched hours is fairly small and we're beginning to consider technology solutions to bridge these. Yes, it will ultimately reinforce the value and impact of solar+storage solutions. Identifying the high carbon hours will help us design and implement solutions with the precision necessary to gain improvement efficiently.
Yes, though I think the real starting point for small companies considering a 24/7 carbon free energy goal is to focus on understanding their own load. They may be able to shift when they consume power from the grid with basic demand management techniques or on-site solar which will naturally improve their carbon free energy score, and likely save money while doing it.

We're big fans of on-site solar, having installed the largest data center rooftop system in the U.S. last year. It is clearly the most accessible, lowest cost and most efficient generation source available today. So much so that in most cases there is more roof-space available than what is needed to cover site consumption during the day.
Further progress could be made in decarbonizing the grid if regulatory programs were expanded to encourage the export of excess on-site solar generation. We're exploring this in one of our European markets today, working with the local grid operator to identify efficient large-scale export that can be complementary to the grid, reducing the energy they would need to source from outside their local network. There is plenty more capacity on rooftops in most communities, the limiting factor is often policy related.
We're big fans of on-site solar, having installed the largest data center rooftop system in the US last year. It is clearly the most accessible, lowest cost and most efficient generation source available today.
The 24/7 carbon free energy journey is fundamentally different, and more difficult, than the conventional annual 100% renewable goal. Many firms have already achieved 100% annually, and are recognizing that there is still more work to do. Unlike the 100% annual goal, hourly matching will rely on advances in technology and new marketplaces which are not fully matured.
This uncertainty with precisely how to achieve results may be too great for some companies to set this as a goal today. We believe in the power of innovation and collaboration and the importance of setting a clear and ambitious goal. Setting a goal, whether it is 24/7 carbon free energy or an ambitious carbon emissions reduction goal, is the real point here, and it is great to see a growing number of companies leaning in to make an impact on decarbonizing our energy supply.

While costs for storage are declining, it is still expensive. Lower cost storage will enable us to expand our solar developments beyond what we may be able to consume in any given moment.
We have looked at hundreds of rooftops over the last few years. The typical reasons projects don't move ahead are the usual suspects – insufficient structural capacity, a need for roof replacement in just a few years and preferring to postpone installation rather than fund a remove/replace. Landlords at leased sites not supportive of solar has also been an issue, though this has nearly gone away the past couple years.
We will continue to seek ways to contract for new carbon free energy in all the markets we operate in globally, in support of our 24/7 carbon free energy goal. Re-Source was very beneficial in establishing relationships with the providers that are ultimately critical to us in achieving success.

Today, lava has spread from the volcano near the town of El Paraíso in the municipality of El Paso, to reach the urban are of La Laguna.
In the Las Manchas area of El Paso there sits 1 MW PV plant which was inaugurated in 2008, develop d by Gamesa Solar and later acquired by U.S. based investment fund First Reserve Corporation. The plant occupies 1.7 hectares of land and, according to a statement issued by Gamesa shortly after its inauguration, consists of some 5,000 PV modules. Today, these modules have been covered by up to one meter of ash spewed from the volcano.
According to online news site Nius, firefighters have been trying to clean the rooftops of nearby houses to prevent wind from blowing even more ash onto the panels, and they are waiting for the eruption to calm before they can return to the site and begin cleaning and evaluating the state of the PV system. “Only then can the losses incurred be valued,” states the article from Nius. “Its owners are aware that it is likely they will have to rebuild the project from scratch.”
At pv magazine we have frequently discussed the effects of extreme heat on panels and their performance, as well the effect of heavy loads (more commonly snow) resting on the modules, including in Spain where the winter storm Filomena left a third of the country blanketed in white earlier this year.
But what happens when solar panels are completely covered by volcanic ash? “In principle, the panels should not be considered lost, a meter of snow doesn’t leave them completely unusable either,” explains Asier Ukar, senior consultant at PI Berlin and the managing director of its Spanish subsidiary, PI Berlin S.L.
Ukar goes on to say, however, that the ash may cause several long-term problems for the PV project: the sheer weight of it could damage the mounting structure; sharp particles or stones mixed in could scratch the module glass; and the ash might contain aggressive compounds such as acids or sulfides that cause backsheet corrosion.
“All of this will become clear once the ash can be removed,” continues Ukar. The panels should be able to support between 2,400 and 5,400 pascals of pressure, depending on the standard they have been tested to. “If the ash is light, there should be no problem,” he adds.
Scratches to glass would also negatively affect performance, but Ukar believes this would be unlikely to put the project out of commission entirely, and would simply lead to more transmission losses of light through the glass.
The possibility of backsheet corrosion would also depend on how long the ash remains before it can be cleaned up, but Ukar says this “should not be a serious issue, as long as the ash is removed soon, since in principle the panels are only covered from the front.”
He adds that since the entire project is equally covered in ash, formation of hotspots should not be a problem. “Honestly, I don’t see it as serious,” he concludes.

USD$13.8 million has been invested in a high quality nickel, cobalt and manganese pilot production facility for battery cathodes. The investment is a combination of cash and “in kind” in investment.
The cathode is a key component in lithium-ion batteries, allowing the high powered charging and discharging of lithium ion batteries. It can be one of the most costly battery components and its quality crucial for battery performance and safety. A Canadian study, from McGill University, found that the cathode can account for up to 40% of lithium-ion battery cell production costs.
WA is hoping to establish processing facilities for key cathode materials under the Cathode Precursor Production project. The WA government is contributing $673,000 to the project. The funding is part of a $9.9 million the WA government is investing in cathode manufacturing projects.

“Western Australia already exports all the minerals needed to make a battery but now we have the exciting opportunity to move into the next step of manufacturing these materials,” said Bill Johnston, the WA Minister for Mines and Petroleum. Johnston is also responsible for the WA energy portfolio.
Once the manufacturing facility is completed, an 18 month trial will be carried out to assess its feasibility and competitiveness. A 2020 report found that WA has a “once in a generation opportunity” to develop cathode material production capabilities.
The cathode precursor project compliments miner BHP’s Nickel West facility that will produce nickel sulphate in Kwinana, south of Perth. The refinery was opened this month.
Lithium hydroxide plants are also under construction in the state, which the state government says indicates activity “along the battery value chain.”
Vanadium electrolyte manufacturing is also being pursued in WA, to support the production of vanadium redox flow batteries.
“Diversifying our economy and increasing our activity in mineral processing and advanced manufacturing are key objectives,“ added Johnston.
A report published earlier this month made the case for Australia to leverage its mineral wealth by creating battery manufacturing “hubs”.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/21/bangladesh-looks-to-nuclear-to-raise-clean-energy-share/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,BANGLADESH",SYFUL ISLAM,"OCTOBER 21, 2021",Bangladesh looks to nuclear to raise clean energy share,"The government of Bangladesh is pushing ahead with plans for new nuclear power plants to form the backbone of its energy mix, a strategy that has been criticized by the country's renewable energy industry.
Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, energy adviser to the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, said small-sized modular nuclear reactors are available nowadays which can be used for power generation in small plants.
“The main source of clean energy in Bangladesh will be nuclear power,” he said at an event on alternative energy in Dhaka this week.
He said the share of clean energy in the country will rise significantly once several large nuclear power plants currently under construction come online. “There is huge potential of nuclear power in the long run.”
Chowdhury further said densely populated Bangladesh has a shortage of vacant lands suitable for wind or solar. “So, if we can set up solar panels over the rivers and canals that can bring some power for us.”
By 2024 Bangladesh will bring 2.4 GW of nuclear power online, from two plants in Pabna district in the north-west of the country. Installation of first reactor at these projects began on October 10.
However, renewable energy advocates in Bangladesh criticized this strategy as high risk and expensive, and urge the government to follow other countries in focusing on wind and solar as primary sourcers of energy.
Dipal C Barua, president, Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association said that if there really was scope for nuclear energy to be the main backbone of clean energy, score of other nations would have installed nuclear power plants by now.
Rather, most are now setting up solar, wind, or other kinds of renewable energy based power plants, he pointed out. 
Barua, a pioneer in Bangladesh’s pv industry, said the investment requirements, maintenance risks, and also the over dependence on some particular countries for nuclear fuels also should have been taken into consideration before opting to focus on nuclear power.
On the other hand, he said, “in case of solar, wind, and hydro energy, the dependence is only on nature.” “Due to severe price hike of LNG, power generation cost in many countries already gone severely up.” 
“The growing rate of efficiency of solar panels and technological improvements gives hope that solar and wind power will be the main source of green power in the future, not nuclear,” said the solar power advocate.
Barua said it is true that Bangladesh lacks adequate land for large-scale solar power plants. “But due to the over population there are a large number of buildings here as well. The rooftops of them can produce huge solar electricity.”
Bangladesh now produces 776 MW of electricity from renewable sources like solar, wind, hydro, biogas, and biomass of which 542 MW alone comes from solar. Earlier this week a report also criticized the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank for continuing to invest in new fossil fuel projects in the country.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/21/prioritizing-electrification/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 21, 2021",Prioritizing electrification,"From pv magazine 10/2021
Residential and commercial buildings are expected to make up 12% of global emissions through 2050. The International Energy Agency (IEA) says that fossil-fueled and conventional electric heating appliances make up 70% to 80% of new sales today, with developing countries such as India and China blackening their air with emissions of solid fuels such as coal and wood – the most polluting.
In order to remain in line with its Sustainable Development Scenario for climate change, the IEA estimates that clean heating sources must reach 50% of global sales by 2030. For most buildings, heat pumps are the optimal solution. By moving heat rather than creating it, they are three to four times more energy efficient than the most efficient fossil tech, and their carbon intensity will fall with the rising penetration of renewables on the grid.
While the generator fleets of China and India remain coal-dependent, the levelized cost of utility solar has fallen below that of coal in both countries, justifying investment in electrification today for emissions reductions in coming decades.
Heat pumps are the fastest-growing heating technology today, with global sales increasing from 14 million units in 2014 to 20 million in 2019. They have reached 90% of sales in some Nordic countries, dispelling the myth that the technology cannot perform in cold climates. Much faster adoption is required, however, as this penetration represents only 5% of global sales – far short of a 50% target.
Cost hurdle
The main challenge that heat pumps face is their upfront cost. This is compounded in many regions by high electricity costs relative to those of fossil fuels. However, the 15-year net present cost of an air-source heat pump can be lower than that of a natural gas furnace on account of its energy efficiency, even in low-cost natural gas environments like the United States.
This is typically the case for new construction and when the heat pump is replacing both an air conditioner and a furnace. When only the furnace is replaced, incentives of around $6,000 are required to break even. Investment in customer education as much as in incentives is needed to translate these case-based economics into increased heat pump demand for retrofits and new construction.
A consequence of limited customer demand is a contractor industry lacking in heat pump awareness and expertise. A survey by the UK Heat Pump Association of fossil fuel heating system installers found that 43% had no experience with heat pumps, and a majority believed that both manufacturers and contractor organizations should be responsible for more widespread training.
Governments have stepped in to boost the heat pump market, through direct incentives and building code updates that promote energy efficiency, emissions reduction, or electrification. The EU’s Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), for example, requires all buildings become “nearly zero-energy buildings,” a standard that each member state can define for itself. Under the landmark building code that California is likely to enact in December, new single- and multi-family homes, as well as schools, offices, and many businesses, are required to install heat pumps or meet their efficiency standards.
Unfortunately, U.S. municipal efforts to ban gas hookups have prompted a fierce political reaction, with at least 20 states adopting or considering legislation to preempt such building code enforcement. As a result, Wood Mackenzie forecasts that under current trends, 68% of U.S. states will fail to electrify half of all single-family homes by 2030.

Decarbonization solutions
Banning natural gas is not necessarily the right solution for decarbonization. While electrification must be the primary solution, it can only take us so far. Heating demand is anti-correlated to solar irradiation, on both seasonal and daily timescales. Wood Mackenzie forecasts solar will represent 15% of global fleet capacity by 2040 under a base case, which could reach even higher penetration given the Biden administration’s 45% by 2050 target and the EU’s Fit for 55 package.
Moreover, an Oxford University study found that as of 2018, the United Kingdom and Germany’s heating demand were two and three times their electricity demand, respectively, further exacerbating the challenge. Together, these findings illustrate that even with massive long-term energy storage investment, the power sector cannot meet the world’s entire heating demand. Complementary fuels and technologies will be needed.
One option is to decarbonize gas networks, both by reducing methane leakage and by introducing renewable natural gas (RNG), which can be used in existing furnaces and boilers or hybrid heat pumps. RNG, or biomethane, results from purifying biogas, which is produced by anaerobic digestion or thermal gasification of food, agricultural, or landfill organic waste. Europe leads the world with 60% of RNG production today, followed by the United States with 20%. The tech remains heavily policy support-dependent, however, with costs in the U.S. ranging from $7-25/ metric million British thermal units (MMBtu), far above conventional gas, which trades closer to $2.50/MMBtu.
District heating is another complement to electrification, offering economies of scale for metropolitan areas. Popular in China, Russia, and Europe, district heating is largely fossil-fueled today, but offers multiple avenues for decarbonization. Networks of hot water or steam can deliver heat to an entire municipality from industrial-scale heat pumps, biogas furnaces, solar thermal, and combined heat and power facilities. Significantly, they can also deliver waste heat captured from industrial facilities, such as data centers and water treatment plants, which an EU study estimates could conservatively cover 25% of the continent’s district heating demand.
All input energy to data centers is converted to waste heat, notably, and a global array of operators – including Google, Amazon, IBM, and Intel – have signed on to a European Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact, which includes the reuse of waste heat. Other European waste heat initiatives include the ReUseHeat Project, funded by the EU’s Horizon 2020 Programme for Research and Development, which has four large-scale demonstration projects underway, including a data center and an underground metro system.

Providence Asset Group, an Australian clean energy investment firm, has revealed that it will install hydrogen-lithium battery energy storage technology developed by green hydrogen storage specialist LAVO at its 10 solar farms in the Australian state of Victoria, after finalizing AUD 33 million ($24.8 million) of project financing with Commonwealth Bank (CBA).
Providence Asset Group said the community-based solar projects – including 5 MW solar farms in Katamatite, Numurkah, Echuca West, Echuca and Stanhope – are already operational. They cumulatively produce 100% renewable energy to power approximately 20,000 households each year.
The Victorian solar farms form part of Providence’s master plan. It is also extending its footprint into regional New South Wales (NSW), where it intends to develop another 29 community solar projects, including projects at Manilla, South Tamworth, Guyra and Gunnedah, increasing its total portfolio to almost 40 ~5 MW solar farms across both states.
“Providence Asset Group recognizes the enormous opportunities that exist in our regions and we’re excited to be partnering with regional communities to deliver more affordable and sustainable energy solutions,” said Chief Investment Officer Alan Yu.
As part of the infrastructure rollout, Providence plans to deploy advanced hybrid storage technology – including hydrogen storage and traditional lithium-ion batteries – at its regional solar farm locations. Each solar farm is to be fitted with Sydney-based LAVO’s HEOS renewable hydrogen energy storage system.
Developed in partnership with the University of NSW’s Hydrogen Energy Research Centre, with the seed investment from Providence Asset Group, LAVO’s HEOS hydrogen energy storage system uses patented metal hybrid technology to store hydrogen equivalent to up to 60 kWh which will produce 40 kWh of useable electricity.
At installation, the energy storage system is connected to a solar PV array via a hybrid inverter, and to water via a purification system, to enable internal electrolyzers to convert excess energy into hydrogen, which it stores in four canisters.
When stored energy is needed, the HEOS activates a fuel cell to deliver electricity. An integrated 5 kWh lithium battery provides a buffer that can provide instantaneous response to power shortage or outage.
Yu, who is also the CEO and executive director of LAVO, said the development of low-cost hydrogen storage is creating a new and exciting opportunity for Australian residences and businesses.
“Providence Asset Group is proud to be at the forefront of the energy transition in Australia, applying the innovative storage technology of the LAVO HEOS with our existing and planned portfolio of regional solar farms,” he said.
Providence Asset Group plans to initially trial the LAVO hydrogen energy storage system at its Stanhope solar farm in Victoria. Installation is expected in the fourth quarter of 2021 and aims to progressively deploy the technology across the rest of its portfolio during the 2023-24 period.
Providence Asset Group has already secured an offtake agreement for its solar farm portfolio, signing a multi-year power purchase agreement (PPA) earlier this year with SmartestEnergy Australia, a subsidiary of Japanese investment giant Marubeni. Under the terms of the agreement, SmartestEnergy will purchase the renewable generation output of the solar farms for an initial 30-month period, with both parties planning for a 10-year extension on the firming PPA at the end of the initial period.
Providence Asset Group said when all the solar farms are operating, the combined generation output will be around 500 GWh per annum.

In an effort to quantify the overall value that community solar programs could add, the Coalition for Community Solar Access enlisted Michigan State University’s Product Center/Center for Economic Analysis to assess such a program’s economic contributions.
Dr. Steven R. Miller and Dr. William Knudson assumed that the program would enable the installation of 150 MW of capacity per year for six years. The program’s final 900 MW of capacity would be spread out over 30 installations per year, each with a capacity of 5 MW, typical for such installations.
The analysis also assumes the installations would be distributed statewide rather than centralized to a few counties, and that the lifespan of a facility would be 25 years. The study did not consider other value-creating resources, such as energy storage.
The benefits were calculated as additions to Michigan’s gross state product, meaning what they would add to the state’s total annual value of goods produced and services provided. All figures were calculated in current dollars, rather than projected for the future.
Project installation alone was determined to generate $474.84 million in cumulative gross state product. Lifetime operations and maintenance (O&M) expenditures were expected to generate $952.01 million in gross state product. Over the life of the program, the combined discounted contributions to gross state product were estimated to be $1.47 billion.
Breaking the numbers down into annual terms, the report outlined that the industry-wide construction contribution to gross state product would be $79.14 million for the six years of installation. The annual contributions from O&M averaged to around $30.71 million over the 31-year projections.
The report also projected contributions to Michigan labor income and employment. It calculated an estimated 900 new Michigan jobs per year, with a total of $318.56 million in labor income over the six years of installations.
Aside from construction, the team estimated that 423 annual jobs would be created and linked to O&M operations over the 31-year span. The projected labor income, discounted to current values over this same period, was expected to be $412.36 million.
The current value of expected labor income (both installation and O&M) over the 31-year analysis was $730.92 million. And the current value of future stream of contributions to gross state product exceeded $1.426 billion over the same time span.
On a per-project basis, a single 5 MW community solar project would directly employ about 15 Michigan workers and support about 30 jobs with a total payroll of just under $2 million. In addition, the analysis estimated that a single 5 MW community solar project would contribute nearly $3 million in annual gross domestic project during the installation phase.
