OnSight Technology, a California-based startup, has developed an autonomous, tele-operated unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with a radiometric thermal imaging camera. It also has an optical zoom camera, backed by artificial intelligence, to detect, report and observe problems and anomalies in solar plants.
It is powered by solar energy and can move at a speed of 1.6 km per hour for up to 12 hours a day.
“The capabilities lead to the lowest cost and highest quality data in the industry,” said the company.
The company recently updated the solar O&M robot, which can now be booked through the manufacturer's website. It uses 5G technology.
“It is controlled through our online portal and uses an Xbox controller,” the company said. “Setup is very simple and using the Xbox controller makes learning to move the robot extremely easy.”
OnSight Technology said that the robot can adapt to the needs of specific PV installations. The company also offers training and support to project owners.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/09/european-battery-manufacturers-unhappy-with-eco-design-and-recycling-proposals/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,EUROPE",MAX HALL,"MARCH 9, 2022",European battery manufacturers unhappy with eco-design and recycling proposals,"With the European Parliament today set to debate proposals for the regulations which will govern the bloc's hoped-for battery manufacturing industry, the membership body representing battery makers is pushing back on various eco-design and recycling requirements of the rules.
Industry body Recharge has leveled criticism at four proposed amendments to the regulations, which were tabled by the parliament's committee on the environment, public health and food safety.
A statement issued by Recharge yesterday said the suggestion individual battery cells must be removable and replaceable in European products would pose a safety risk, given the requirement all cells in a battery must be absolutely identical.

Circular manufacturing has been under the spotlight of our UP Initiative. We considered whether adopting circular approaches could create a competitive edge and reap financial and reputational rewards, in addition to investigating what is already being done in the solar industry. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.

Claude Chanson, general manager of Recharge, quoted in a press release issued by the organization, said: “Design requirements regarding the removability of individual cells inside batteries will jeopardize longevity and the safety of batteries.”
The membership body said a requirement batteries used in automotive and specifically electric vehicle (EV) applications, plus industrial batteries, should also be removable and replaceable was impractical because of the variety of types of product and their uses. Recharge said such batteries are currently used in settings as diverse as nuclear power plant back-up systems, high-speed trains, airplanes, and offshore platforms.
Recharge also criticized a definition of battery manufacturers as “producer” of their products when supplying them to original equipment manufacturers in the same EU state, and said universal requirements for battery makers to have to take back and recycle products made by other companies in different industrial segments was impractical and potentially dangerous.
On the latter point, the industry body said the proposal for a rule similar to that applied in the EU to waste electrical and electronic equipment – that manufacturers be required to accept and recycle products whether made in their own factories or not – might mean a company which made small batteries for use in gas meters could be required to collect and recycle containerized, industrial scale products.
The Recharge statement read: “The take-back obligation on industrial and EV batteries must be limited to the products that a producer has placed on the market and must not require to take back products that were placed on the market by other producers, regardless [of] the size of their business … Such an obligation … is not justified and would potentially lead to impossible or unsafe situations.”
European Parliament MEPs are due to vote on the batteries regulation proposed by the European Commission – including the amendments proposed by the parliament's committee on the environment, public health and food safety – tomorrow.

Presented in the paper NiMoV and NiO-based catalysts for efficient solar-driven water splitting using thermally integrated photovoltaics in a scalable approach, published in Cell, the device is described by its creators as an electrolysis device combining copper, indium, gallium and selenium (CIGS) thin-film solar modules with an alkaline electrolyzer based on a trimetallic cathodic catalyst made of nickel, molybdenum, and vanadium (NiMoV) and an anode made of nickel oxide (NiO).
In the proposed system configuration, the anodic NiO electrocatalyst is used as a counter-electrode to the NiMoV cathode. The anode and cathode of the electrolysis cell were placed in close contact with each other and separated by an anion exchange membrane and thin glass was used as the wall of the cell to enable thermal coupling and heat exchange.
“The anodic and cathodic catalysts were positioned in close connection in the design to minimize mass transport limitations in the design, where modules of the size constructed here could be assembled into arrays for larger area installations for convenient maintenance and replacement of separate modules,” the scientists explained. “The approach allows a heat transfer between the PV and electrolysis parts beneficial for improved system efficiency, where a decrease in PV efficiency from high operating temperature is compensated by increased electrolysis efficiency, and vice versa for low operating temperature.”
A 14.5%-efficient CIGS module with an area of 78cm2 was placed in thermal contact with the electrolysis device that has an active area of 100cm2. The operating voltage for the combined PV-electrolyzer system was estimated at 1.63V. Nickel plates measuring 130×130×5mm were used to cover the electrolyzer in order to minimize corrosion and ensure long-term stability.
The performance of the solar-powered electrolyzer was evaluated with operating temperatures ranging from 25 to 50 degrees Celsius and under standard solar illumination. The champion device, built with a 4-cell solar module, was able to provide an average solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 8.5% for stable operations during 100 hours. Its maximum efficiency reached up to 9.1%. “The results in the present study bear promise toward large-scale implementations using matched integrated PV-electrolysis with stable thin-film PV materials, monolithic design, and utilization of earth-abundant catalyst components,” the researchers stated.

According to the government-run agency, 273 PV projects with a combined capacity of 268.7MW we selected through the procurement exercise, which was the eleventh of the country's auction schemes for utility scale solar and will be the last exercise awarding fixed tariffs. Starting from the next auction, developers will be awarded feed-in premium tariffs.
The lowest bid offered in the auction was ¥8.99/kWh ($0.078) and the average, offered final price was ¥9.99. The ceiling price had been set at ¥10.25/kWh.
The Japanese authorities had accepted to review 345 project proposals with a combined capacity of 278.5MW.
The agency stressed that this is the first time that the minimum price crossed the ¥9 threshold. Total solar capacity, however, was lower than in the tenth auction, in which about 340MW was allocated and the lowest bid reached ¥10.23/kWh.
In 2021, the Japanese government allocated a total of 675MW of PV capacity across three different auctions. In the previous auctions, it allocated 942MW.
The main issues solar developers have to address in Japan are land availability – in part due to restrictions on the use of abandoned agricultural sites – and grid constraints.

German renewable energy company Trianel plans to offer mini power purchase agreements (PPAs) to residential PV system owners in Germany, starting from the second quarter of this year.
Solar array operators will sell their electricity to Trianel at a fixed price. Trianel will then sell that power on the energy futures market. This will ensure that customers get prices above the minimum feed-in tariff for rooftop PV, explained Bastian Wurm, head of direct marketing at Trianel.
For its fixed-price model, Trianel is targeting systems that have been excluded from the German incentive scheme for renewables. According to Wurm, old systems could use the fixed-price model to protect themselves against volatility on electricity markets. The continued operation of the systems can thus be better planned economically.
Trianel has been offering mini PPAs for wind energy, biogas plants and hydroelectric power projects since the end of 2021. Since then, Trianel has included 350MW of capacity in the short-term fixed price payment.
It defines the terms of the mini PPAs directly with the customer. They amount to three to six months on a rolling basis, although the company says it can also envisage longer terms of up to 12 months.
“The fixed prices supplement direct marketing and secure the proceeds via the futures markets,” said Lena Abt, a spokesperson for Trianel. “This means that our customers benefit from the higher prices on the futures markets and at the same time protect themselves against price declines.”
Customers will be able to switch between a fixed price model via mini PPAs, said Trianel.

The Sino-Canadian solar manufacturer and project developer is working on a 51MWp solar field at Trapani, in western Sicily, and a 33MWp site at Viterbo, in central Lazio.
The March edition of pv magazine, which is out today, investigates the rapid rise of TOPCon cell manufacturing. While not the only option PV manufacturers have their eye on, TOPCon is already the first n-type cell to claim significant market share. We chart the tech’s progress from laboratory to gigawatt production plus efforts to standardize process flows, reduce costs, and raise performance.
With the developer yesterday stating construction will begin this year and both facilities will be operational in January 2024, the Italian unit of Swiss energy company Axpo has committed to pay an undisclosed price to buy 70% of the estimated 156GWh per year to be generated by the two sites.
Canadian Solar said the solar plants would produce enough clean energy to power 61,000 households. The ten-year power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed by Axpo commit it to buying around 109.2GWh per year.
Announcing the PPAs in a press release issued by Canadian Solar yesterday, chairman and CEO Shawn Qu said: “We are pleased to sign our second and third PPA with our partner Axpo Italia, becoming the largest solar developer in the country based on contracted volume. The growth of renewable energy in Italy is critical to achieving the country's decarbonization and energy security objectives. We will continue to step up in our leadership role as we continue to grow our pipeline of clean energy projects in Europe.”
News of the energy deals emerged on the day the European Commission called for a massive acceleration of the EU's renewables deployment plans, in order to reduce demand for Russian gas by two-thirds this year following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

UL, a global safety science leader, has published a new report in cooperation with the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
The “Cybersecurity Certification Recommendations for Interconnected Grid Edge Devices and Inverter Based Resources” report notes that cybersecurity threats have become common. For example, just two weeks ago, thousands of internet users in Europe lost access to services when a satellite operator experienced a “cyber event.”
The same attack also knocked nearly 6,000 wind turbines offline in Germany and Central Europe, with a combined output of 11GW. The growth in grid-edge distributed energy resources (DER) offers a potential new target for cyberattacks, which is why certification testing procedure are needed to identify gaps in DER cybersecurity functionality, as well as mandates for secure features at the device, network, and system level.
Distributed energy resources include any grid-connected energy storage and generation technologies and their associated flexible loads, such as solar, battery storage, wind turbines, and fuel cells, among other resources essential to grid operations. The cyber-threat increases when the resources have communication capabilities.
The certification testing procedure can potentially be used in a US industry standard to help manufacturers develop effective approaches to cybersecurity and to help in the development of third-party conformity assessment programs for cybersecurity testing and certification. While standards are not yet in place, this report includes recommendations.
In the meantime, the report acknowledges that “utilities, aggregators, and equipment manufacturers could consider implementing and testing against appropriate elements of existing cybersecurity standards and guidelines as they become available. As a start, they could align their cyber-defenses to (the US National Institute of Standards and Technology) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.”
Kenneth Boyce, senior director for the principal engineering and industrial group at UL, said that there are currently no cybersecurity certification requirements to which manufacturers and vendors can certify their DER and IBR devices against an established, widely adopted cybersecurity certification program. The development of these new cybersecurity certification requirements will provide a single unified approach that can be taken as a reference for performing the testing and certification of DERs before being deployed and while in the field, he claimed.
With support from Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office, UL will continue working with NREL on developing requirements to support cybersecurity certification standards for DERs and IBRs. NREL and UL are currently working on an Outline of Investigation for a standard that will apply to energy storage and generation technologies on the distribution grid, including inverters, EV chargers, wind turbines, fuel cells, and other resources essential to advancing grid operations.
The new requirements will prioritize cybersecurity enhancements for power systems dealing with high penetration inverter-based resources, including those interfacing with bulk power systems for periods of instantaneous high wind, solar and hybrid/storage generation. It will also help ensure cybersecurity is designed into new IBR and DER systems.
“UL supports the development of a cybersecurity certification program because, not only will robust cybersecurity be introduced to the electric grid, but it will also help to ensure the concept of security by design is being followed for new DER systems,” said Danish Saleem, senior researcher for energy cyber-physical system security at NREL.
The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)’s Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards now include cybersecurity requirements with hefty consequences for violations, but having cybersecurity standards and certification will enable corporate security specialists to implement best practices to prevent violations in the first place.

The European Commission yesterday stated its intent to draw up a “RepowerEU” package of policies “by the summer” to try and reduce by two-thirds the volume of Russian gas it imported last year, with the aim of securing that result by the end of December.
The emergency measure was drafted in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the connected threat to supplies of Russian gas, oil and coal to the EU.
A communication published by the EU executive yesterday included proposals to fast-forward the deployment of solar generation capacity – including rooftop PV – which, to date, had been planned to arrive by the end of the decade.
The commission said the EU imported 155 billion m3 (bcm) of Russian gas last year and it will aim to reduce 103bcm of that demand this year by varying its sources of gas supply and dramatically speeding up the deployment of renewables, green hydrogen, and energy efficiency measures. “Let's dash into renewable energy at lightning speed,” said commission VP for the European Green Deal Frans Timmermans, as the RepowerEU plan was announced.
The commission pledged to deliver a solar energy document in June which will include a proposed European Solar Rooftops Initiative and the EU body said successfully installing enough panels to generate the hoped-for 15TWh of clean power this year would remove demand for 2.5bcm of Russian gas.
With the Fit for 55 package – which refers to a planned 55% cut in EU carbon emissions this decade – laying plans for 420GW of solar generation capacity by 2030, speeding up that planned rate of PV project deployment 20%, as the commission suggested yesterday, could reduce demand for a further 20bcm of Russian gas this year.
With the RepowerEU package set to recommend a further 80GW of solar and wind capacity this decade – on top of the figures included in the Fit for 55 plan – to power green hydrogen production, the commission called for EU member states to immediately get to work processing permits for renewable energy projects as quickly as their legislative systems allow, and to allocate the land and water bodies necessary for the raised ambition.
The commission has promised to deliver, in May, recommendations on how to accelerate project permitting and has also told member states and industry it may be necessary to stockpile critical and other raw materials necessary to continue the deployment of renewables.
The commission said the EU should aim to double the projected, Fit for 55 rate of heat pump deployment, to 10 million units over the next five years, a move it said could remove demand for another 1.5bcm of Russian gas this year.
The Brussels-based body said the bloc should secure an extra 15 million tons of green hydrogen this decade, on top of the Fit for 55 volumes, with 10 million tons more than planned to be imported, by 2030, and five million tons more to be generated on European soil. The inclusion of nuclear-fired hydrogen among the definition of the green form of the gas may prove contentious, however.
With solar trade bodies in Italy and Europe having criticized moves by the governments of Spain and Italy to protect households and businesses from rising energy costs by fixing electricity prices and clawing back profits from generators, yesterday's commission announcement implicitly endorsed such moves, as an emergency measure to protect energy users.
The EU executive issued guidance on the circumstances which would permit such moves and its stipulation renewable energy producers be equally affected by such measures may raise the hackles of membership bodies such as Italia Solare and SolarPower Europe, although those organizations registered their opposition to such state-sponsored energy market intervention before the invasion of Ukraine.
With the commission stating the EU imports 90% of its gas, and adding, 45% of those imports arrive from Russia, the RepowerEU plan will also aim to diversify the source of its gas imports. The commission said Norway supplied around 24% of EU gas last year, with another 13% arriving from Algeria, 7% from the US, 5% from Qatar, and 7% from unspecified, “other” markets.
US president Joe Biden yesterday announced a ban on Russian gas imports to the US, potentially rendering that alternative source of the fuel tighter, for EU purposes, and the same might be said of Norway, which the UK takes a lot of its gas from, given Boris Johnson's announcement yesterday of plans to phase down Russian energy-related imports.
The EU also imports around 27% of its oil from Russia, and 46% of its coal, according to the commission.

The scientists explained that products for BIPV projects may differ significantly from each other, especially in terms of voltage. “[This] scattered, nearly random, distribution of possible parameters requires each vendor to find a partner for the development of a specialized power electronic converter,” they also stated. “This slows down system design and limits the flexibility of the solar architecture.”
The device is based on a half-bridge, front-end inverter and a three-mode reconfigurable rectifier (RR). The latter, according to the academics, is able to maintain the duty cycle of the input side while offering what they defined as a “favorable range of acceptable efficiencies.”
The research team built a 360W prototype that it claims can offer an ultra-wide input voltage range of more than 1:20. It is also said to be able to be compatible with different PV module types while enabling their shade-tolerant operation.
“It is smaller than an A5 sheet of paper and as thin as 20mm,” said researcher Andrii Chub. “Considering its electrical parameters, it has no analogs in the world.”
The device can be integrated in both solar facades or BIPV rooftop arrays.

Glass is a very challenging material to study. Under minor deformation, its macroscopic properties are reversible, while its microscopic configurations are irreversible. In simple terms – repetitive heat cycling or mechanical deformation of glass – weakens the material in ways that cannot be measured without inducing failure. As a result, large-format solar panels – greater than our prior commercial standard – have questions of longevity that need to be answered.
Results of the inhomogeneous snow load test have been released for the Longi Hi-MP solar panel. The test simulates a beamless racking installation, in which the glass back of the module floats under its own strength and does not gain support from the racking structure.

The larger format solar panels – 2.6 square meters (28 square feet) – were able to reach or exceed 6,400 pascals (Pa) of force before failing. The press release notes five units were tested, and one of the units reached 7,400 Pa.
One limit to a standard mechanical stress test is that it doesn’t specifically focus pressure in the “lower” half of the solar panel, whereas in real-world settings, that load shifts toward the edge with the deepest snow accumulation. Thus, the creation of the inhomogeneous snow load test, which places increasingly larger weights on the panel, in this case, is installed at at 37 degrees.

As module size increases, the local pressure and bending moment begins to increase exponentially. Longi also tested a 3.1 square-meter module – the size of a large-format 210 mm solar cell based module – which failed at 4,600 Pa.
Longi recently announced that it had reached a sizing standardardization agreement with JA Solar and Jinko Solar for 182 mm solar cell panels. The standardization agreement, among other items, sets the size of 72-cell products at 2,278 mm × 1,134 mm (2.58 square meters), with 78-cell panels set at 2,465 mm × 1,134 mm (2.79 square meters).
The press release from Longi is part of an ongoing discussion among manufacturers as they settle in on the next generation of solar cell and panel sizing.

Longi included a table sharing the amount of glass deformation that would occur before the module actually breaks. Panel deformation matters because it can crack solar cells, and cracked solar cells lower module performance.
