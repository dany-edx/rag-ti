https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/08/large-clusters-of-solar-power-stations-2/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 8, 2021",Large clusters of solar power stations,"We have seen that the world’s largest individual solar power plants now have AC capacity in excess of 1 GW. Meanwhile, solar parks, where several projects are co-located in one organized site, are expanding from about 3 GW towards 5 GW or more.
This ‘solar park’ model is most widely adopted in China, India, and the Middle East, where the electricity industry is highly regulated. In other countries, notably the U.S., where the power market is more liberalized, solar projects also sometimes congregate together around the best locations, but without the formal coordination that solar parks offer. We call these groups of neighboring plants ‘solar clusters’.
Solar clusters typically form in areas where the available grid connection capacity and sunlight levels are favorable. This article looks at some of the largest clusters, though size is more subjective because it depends on how wide an area is included. For consistency, I have totaled the capacity of all plants within a 50 km (31 mile) radius.
This list shows clusters above about 1.5 GWAC, together with (in brackets) the position each held when last published in 2019.
The arid region north of Phalodi in India's Jodhpur district hosted some of India’s earliest utility-scale solar power projects, dating back to 2011. Today it accommodates two solar parks and a growing number of smaller individual solar plants. The Godawari CSP plant at Nokh is also included this cluster (see the red outline near the top).
This cluster’s rise up the table is thanks to new plants at both the Bhadla Solar Park, currently #2 in the world, and Rawra Solar Park, which has now climbed to #6. Between them, the parks house seven 300 MW projects supplying power to India's ISTS (Inter-State Transmission System).
Other standalone solar plants in the area – including the 600-MW Lawan-Purohitsar station further south, now ranked #9 in the world – take the total number in this cluster to 90 with a combined capacity of some 6.6 GW – about the same as the national totals for France or Australia.
Further plants are under development in the district and are expected to take the total capacity of this cluster over 8 GW. Another cluster further east in Rajasthan, the area around Jamsar, houses over 1 GW of plants and is expected to rise to 2.5 GW in coming years.
Gonghe County in Qinghai’s Hainan Prefecture, China, looks like the world’s ‘giga-solar capital’. Readers of the previous articles in this series will not be surprised to see it near the top of this list.
Though the cluster holds only 18 plants, they include the world’s #1 plant Huanghe Hydro­power Developments’ 2.2 GW monster and Longyangxia Solar-Hydro, now listed as the #3 biggest solar park in the world. A handful of other nearby plants take the total capacity of this cluster to 5.1 GW.
New recently installed transmission lines taking the power over 1,000 kilometres east to Beijing make this a prime location for a renewable energy cluster.
 
Imperial County borders Mexico at Mexicali and has become home to many solar projects, including the multi-phase Mount Signal, Centinela and Imperial Valley projects.
Recent expansions to these plants have increased the total capacity to some 2.8 GW, shooting Imperial Valley up this list. Projects still in development should take the eventual total towards 5 GW.
Unlike the previous clusters in arid and desert regions, this is relatively fertile land, making the solar arrays (bordered in blue) harder to spot in this aerial view.
 
It is a sign of how fast Vietnam’s renewables market has progressed that it has now broken into this list. When it was last published in 2019, the whole of Vietnam had less than 1 GW of utility-scale solar.
The southern part of Ninh Thuận province now houses 40 plants with a combined capacity of 2.6 GWAC. The largest plant is Trung Nam Group’s 450 MW plant at Phươc Minh.
Around 12⁰ latitude, this is the first of only two clusters in the top 10 outside the subtropics; all the others are between latitudes 27⁰ and 38⁰N.
 
A second California valley is heading towards 5 GW – this one to the west of the Mojave Desert and north of Los Angeles, Its sunny location is boosted by good connectivity to the electricity markets of south and central California.
Amongst the 70 solar projects in Antelope Valley is the U.S.’s second-largest PV power plant, Solar Star, ranked #10 in the world.
Total connected capacity in this district currently stands at 2.5 GW.
 
 
The other cluster outside the subtropics, centered in Zhangbei County of Zhangjiakou in China's Hebei province is just north of 41⁰N. It houses 1.8 GWAC of utility-scale solar from about 50 projects, a few of which are in neighboring Shangyi County and just over the provincial border in Inner Mongolia. However, the biggest concentration is in the municipality of Gonghuizhen.
Three CSP projects totaling 150 MW were also scheduled to be built in this area, but do not appear to have been completed yet.
 
The area around the city of Jinchang, also in China, accommodates, in addition to the world’s #5 solar park to the northwest, several more solar plants to the southeast, the largest of which is 200 MWP. The combined capacity of this cluster is 1.7 GW, and that can be expected to rise if Jinchuan Solar Park is further built out. However, no new capacity has been added in this cluster since the list published in 2019.
 
 
Zhongwei County in Ningxia is home to Tengger Desert Solar Park – once the world’s largest, but now down at #14. The area also has a few concentrations of individual solar plants, most notably around Zhongning, Hongsibu and Tongxin.
In total, the cluster houses 45 plants with a combined capacity of 1.5 GWAC.
 
In the desert to the south of Las Vegas, around Eldorado Dry Lake are clustered several large solar plants, including the multi-phase Copper Mountain PV project – now #4 in the world – and the Nevada One CSP plant.
Visible in the south-western part of this view are the facilities that make this area so attractive to solar developers – the three high capacity electricity substations and the power lines heading north to power-hungry Las Vegas and southwest to California.
The combined capacity is currently 1.4 GW, with further projects under development.
The list shows that the cluster approach is best suited to less densely populated regions of countries with high energy consumption. It can be expected to spread to parts of South America, Australia, and southern Africa. For example, the areas around Calama and Diego de Almagro in Chile already hold half-GW clusters, which are due to increase substantially.
Europe’s larger solar markets do not have many wide-open spaces available. Typical plant and cluster sizes are smaller, like those in Germany's Brandenburg, France’s Landes, and Montalto di Castro in Italy. Rapid market growth may make Spain an exception, however. Teruel already hosts a ¾-GW cluster, and this is scheduled to grow to 2.6 GW.
The term ‘solar plant’ is used for an individual project that has been developed by a single developer or consortium. The largest of these were listed in an earlier article. Where multiple plants are co-located in a discrete area under the coordination of an identified agency, this is called a solar park, as described in the previous article. Today’s article explains how I use the word cluster where multiple solar farms are sited in an area without formal coordination.

Also for consistency, all capacities are quoted in MW/GWAC to allow direct comparison between PV and CSP plants (and other forms of generation). Readers will be aware that the DC peak capacity of PV plants is typically ~25% higher than the rated AC capacity, quoted here.

The idea is to use a catalyst to bind the hydrogen to the alloy. When heated, the hydrogen is then released. “While the specific chemistry remains part of our ‘secret sauce’ so to speak, we have developed a magnesium-based composite which is proving in testing to be a very promising material for hydrogen storage purposes,” research scientist Brian Ellis said in a press release on Tuesday. According to CNL, the new alloy is capable of storing “just a little over 6% of its weight in hydrogen.” Researchers say that the development might be prohibitive for small passenger vehicles, but an advantage in heavy equipment. “A hydrogen-powered passenger car currently carries approximately 10 kilograms of hydrogen (as a compressed gas) to allow its full operating range. That same 10 kilograms of hydrogen stored in metal would weigh upwards of 150 kilograms,” CNL stated, adding that the magnesium-based alloy would, for instance, come in handy for fork lifts.
South Korean car parts company Hyundai Mobis announced a $1.1 billion (€0.95 billion) investment in two new fuel cell plants in Korea. The aim is to accelerate the hydrogen economy and “to secure broader global market dominance.” According to the South Korean public company, the new plants will start mass production in the second half of 2023. “When fully operational, the facilities are expected to produce 100,000 hydrogen fuel cells every year,” the company announced on Thursday. Hyundai Mobis already operates one fuel cell plant in Chungju with a capacity of 23,000 hydrogen cell systems a year. “We will continue to invest more in facilities and strengthen our R&D capability for the development of the hydrogen industry and expand the ecosystem,” said Hyundai Mobis President and CEO Sung Hwan Cho. Current production mainly targets fuel cell EVs, but the company wants to also provide fuel cells to other sectors, mostly construction machinery and logistics equipment.

U.S.-based hydrogen solutions company Plug Power and SK E&S, part of South Korea’s SK Group, formed a joint venture to accelerate the use of hydrogen as an alternative energy source in Asian markets. The scope of the collaboration will include hydrogen fuel cell systems, hydrogen fueling stations, electrolyzers, and green hydrogen. Earlier this year, SK Group made a $1.6 billion (€1.38 billion) capital investment in Plug Power. SK E&S and Plug Power will own 51% and 49% of the joint venture. Plans include the construction of a gigafactory in South Korea by 2024.
Spanish oil and gas major Repsol, which produced renewable hydrogen using biomethane as a raw material for the first time earlier this month, increased its targets for renewable generation and emission reductions. The company said it was increasing “investments in the 2021-2025 period to €19.3 billion, allocating an additional €1 billion over the period of the Strategic Plan to step up its renewable electricity generation capacity and production of renewable hydrogen, as well as other low-carbon initiatives.” Repsol plans to produce 552 MW equivalent of renewable hydrogen in 2025, and 1.9 GW in 2030. The company said it would achieve its objectives through the installation of electrolyzers and biogas production plants at its industrial complexes, as well as the development of photoelectrocatalysis technology. “This technology is a joint development of Repsol and Enagas, and a demonstration plant will be installed at the Puertollano industrial complex in 2025 to obtain hydrogen directly from water using solar energy,” the company said. Repsol announced earlier this week that it had produced 10 tons of renewable hydrogen from 500 MWh of biomethane at its Cartagena Industrial Complex.
South Africa’s integrated energy and chemical company Sasol signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with the Northern Cape Development Agency (NCEDA) to lead a feasibility study exploring the potential of Boegoebaai as an export hub for green hydrogen and ammonia. “The Boegoebaai ‘green hydrogen’ development has been designated a Strategic Integrated Project (SIP) in the South African National Development Plan and is located in the Namakwa Special Economic Zone (SEZ). The project’s location and classification as a SIP are key enablers to exploring Boegoebaai’s potential as a global green hydrogen hub,” the company wrote on Wednesday. It expects the feasibility study to take approximately 24 months. Sasol partnered with the Gauteng provincial government to leverage special economic zones and with the Industrial Development Corporation for joint funding. The focus should be on mobility for the local market and aviation for international markets. The project has the potential to produce 400 kilotons of hydrogen per annum, according to local media reports, which cited Priscillah Mabelane, Sasol's executive vice president for energy.
Australia’s Northern Territory government released its Renewable Hydrogen Master Plan to guide the development of a Northern Territory renewable hydrogen industry. “The Territory is well placed to position itself at the forefront of the developing renewable hydrogen industry with large areas of land, high solar irradiance, close proximity to export markets, and an established world-scale energy production and export industry,” the government said Thursday. The plan hinges on a two-step approach. The government first wants to support the early adoption of renewable hydrogen as a fuel source locally through transport corridors before scaling up to export it. It's also banking on large-scale geological storage. The Northern Territory represents around 15% of Australia’s total LNG production and export. It now wants to replicate, or even increase, this share of total Australian hydrogen production and export. “Darwin is the closest Australian capital city and deep sea port to key export markets such as Japan, Korea, China and Singapore,” reads the complete Master Plan.

The plan will require around RMB 2.29 billion ($264.6 million) in investments. The new factory will be located in Luyoang, Henan Province.  The entire project is planned to be completed within 30 months. The first phase, which is expected to last 18 months, includes the construction of the air compressor station, circulating water system, substation, waste heat power station, flue gas treatment and rooftop PV power generation.
Wafer maker Wuxi Shangji has secured a big wafer supply agreement from Longsheng New Energy, a Jiangsu-based solar producer. Under the terms of the agreement, Shangji will deliver around 670 million pieces of wafer products from October 2021 to September of 2024. The two companies will set the purchase price on a monthly basis. According to the latest wafer prices from market research institute PV Infolink, the contract is valued at around RMB 3.93 billion ($609.5 million).
Polysilicon supplier and solar cell maker Tongwei expects to post a net profit of up to RMB 2.67 billion ($414 million) for the first three quarters of this year, which would represent a growth of up to 80% from the same period a year earlier. Tongwei attributed the growth to the fast-growing demand for polysilicon. The company said it continues to operate at full capacity.

The two Mexican factories are located in Ensenada and Mexicali, which are both in the state of Baja California, close to the US border.
“The two facilities should reach a capacity of around 2.6 GW,” Maxeon Chief Revenue Officer Mark Babcock told pv magazine during the ongoing Intersolar event in Munich, Germany. “The facility in Ensenada is currently being ramped up to 800 MW and will produce our IBC modules for all markets, and the one in Mexicali should reach 1.8 GW and will manufacture only products based on the company's mono PERC shingled technology.”
Production should start again at the two facilities in late Q1. “We have committed deliveries in early Q2,” he added. “We could sell these products also in non-US markets, but right now it's more profitable shipping them there.”

The solar cells for the new production in Mexicali will be provided by Maxeon's 1.8 GW manufacturing facility in Malaysia, which will produce uniquely for the Mexican facilities. Babcock said he was not concerned about a possible investigation by the US Department of Commerce into solar cells and modules that are imported from Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand. “We have been in Malaysia for years and it is not to get around anything,” he further explained. “That facility started many years ago.”
Modules produced at the two facilities will be sold as SunPower-branded rooftop products to SunPower itself and Maxeon-branded modules for the utility-scale segment. “We saw headwinds for Chinese production and we feel very strongly that our manufacturing base in China will serve the rest of the world,” Babcock said. “Given the trade restrictions with the United States, the only way to bring our products to the US market was to use our Mexican factories, which was great, as the facilities have been in operation for many years.”
Maxeon is also examining the possibility of expanding its production capacity for the US market by opening a new factory there, although no location has been identified to date. “We made that public in our latest earnings call,” he stated. “The final decision it will depend to some degree on the measures that the US congress may introduce to support solar manufacturing.”
Finding the rights partners to build the rest of the supply chain will be crucial for long-term competitiveness. “It is not only about the cells, you need the glass, the aluminum and the backsheets and without this ecosystem it will be impossible,” he concluded.
*The article was updated on October 8 to reflect that only the factory in Mexicali will serve exclusively the US market.

The JW-HD132N panel is based on 210 mm wafers built with the company's n-type TOPCon 2.0 cell technology dubbed Niwa Max, which the manufacturer said reached efficiencies of up to 25.4% in the laboratory. This record has passed the China National Institute of Metrology's third-party testing certification and achieved the highest efficiency ever in the industry for a large wafer NTOPCon cell.
The 132-cell panel, which is the most powerful product manufactured by the company to date, is available in six versions, with nominal power ranging from 675 to 700 W and a power conversion efficiency of 21.73 to 22.53%. The open-circuit voltage spans from 46.2 to 47.1 V and the short-circuit current from 18.57 to 18.82 A.
The double-glass product has dimensions of 2,384 x 1,303 x 35 mm and a weight of 38 kg. It is fabricated with 2.0 mm glass and an IP68 enclosure. The module can operate with a system voltage of 1,500 V and in temperatures ranging between -40 and 85 degrees Celsius. It features a temperature coefficient of -0.32% per degree Celsius.
Jolywood offers a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year power output guarantee. Annual linear degradation over 30 years is indicated at 0.40% while degradation for the first year of the panel’s lifetime is capped at 1.0%.
In July, Jolywood started construction of its new solar cell factory in Taiyuan City, Shanxi province. The 16 GW manufacturing facility will exclusively produce TOPCon solar cells and its first, 8 GW phase is expected to be completed within 24 months. Jolywood signed the agreement for the project with the government of Taiyuan in May.
At the end of 2020, the company had an n-type TOPCon cell capacity of 2.1 GW and a module capacity of 2.7 GW.

“Whilst a clearly orchestrated plan was set in motion which sought to tarnish our good name and reputation as the only 100% South African owned photovoltaic manufacturer, we are glad that the Court saw through this and dismissed this ill-conceived application with costs,” ARTSolar CEO Viren Gosai told pv magazine.
In its lawsuit, Suntech Solar Power South Africa described the exemptions granted to the two companies as “unlawful,” adding that they excluded all other module suppliers from competitively participating in the Risk Mitigation Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (RMIPPPP).
“(It) forces preferred bidders to procure from ARTsolar and Seraphim and its Chinese partners, LONGi Solar and Seraphim China,” South African media outlet Engineering News cited Suntech Solar as saying in the lawsuit.
The tender was launched in response to a chronic short-term electricity supply gap that has been affecting the country and its mining sector. Renewable energy developers were also allowed to participate.
The RMIPPPP attracted 28 bid responses with a potential contracted capacity of approximately 5.12 GW. The DMRE selected eight preferred bids totaling 1.85 GW. Around 60% of the 2 GW tender capacity was awarded to several floating power plants powered by liquefied natural gas, but several PV projects were ultimately selected and they had to compete in ensuring a certain level of local content requirements – not only with other technologies, but also with each other.

Switzerland-based solar module maker Meyer Burger has unveiled new solar tiles for a building-integrated PV (BIPV) project at the Intersolar event, which is being held this week in Munich, Germany. The new product was designed by German engineering company paXos Consulting & Engineering GmbH & Co. KG, which sold the related patents to Meyer Burger.
The tiles measure 44 cm x 33 cm x 3 cm and weigh in at 2.5 kg. This makes them lighter than normal roof tiles, says paXos Managing Director Peter Hakenberg. He claims this is an important advantage, particularly in relation to snow loads.
The black PV tiles heat up considerably in summer, which is why there is a continuous ventilation duct from the lower to the upper bricks, producing a chimney effect. At the top of the ridge, the hot air can be discharged or used for heating. In the winter, when the temperature differences are not so great, a fan can specifically suck in the heated air and direct it to a heat exchanger or heat pump.
Hakenberg says the paXos prototype has been assessed in wind tunnels and other practical tests. He said the company hopes for a noticeable reduction in costs, compared to conventional rooftop systems.
Frank Hoetzsch, head of service at Meyer Burger, announced that production of the tiles will begin in the second half of 2022. He noted that the company is conducting tests with the Cologne University of Applied Sciences to determine the exact thermal performance of the new product.

The system works in four steps. First, it is charged by a renewable source of electricity, which is then stored in the form of heat in a recycled aluminum alloy, with a phase change at 600 degrees Celsius. The heat is in turn dispatched to a Stirling engine, which is a closed-cycle regenerative heat engine with a permanent gaseous working fluid. The engine generates usable heat with a temperature ranging from 55 to 65 degrees Celsius and electricity that can be utilized on demand at all hours of the day.
The system measures 2.810 x 2.67 x 3.65 m and has a nominal electrical output of 13 kW. One unit’s storage capacity reaches 165 kWh. A system combines units in clusters, for example in 20 units with a storage capacity of 3.3 MWh of electrical output, and thermal energy on top of that. The system is scalable in systems of up to 100 MW, with an initial commercial focus of up to 20 MW installations.
The manufacturer says the product is particularly suitable for commercial and industrial projects in unstable or off-grid locations with an economically viable renewable baseload source. However, the instability of grid prices and supply has enhanced the systems’ relevance also for grid-connected locations.
“The system is designed for daily cycles, which makes it suitable for systems combining solar PV for energy supply during daytime, while charging the storage,” the company's Director Communications and Marketing, Johan Sahlin, told pv magazine. “The TES.POD then supplies renewable energy during the night or when direct production is insufficient, completing the 24h cycle with renewable energy.”
Production of the TES.POD system was launched at the company's facilities in Sweden in mid-September. “The production chain consists of the assembly of cylinder kits in the company's facilities in Åmål, followed by the final assembly of a complete Stirling engine in its factory in Uddevalla,” the manufacturer said in a statement released at the time.
So far, the company has secured orders for two TES.POD units in Sweden and one unit in Dubai as well as a conditional 260 kW/3.3 MWh order from Egypt. “The company's goal for 2021 is to sign and begin delivery of one or two projects in the size of 100 kW or larger,” the company stated.

It was a smaller than normal event, yet happily, it felt more concentrated and focused than reduced. From new solar and storage products, to supply constraints, European manufacturing potential, and green hydrogen, the E Restart managed to pack a lot into a bustling few days.

Today was Michael’s PV mounting system experience! After having visited the booths of K2, arausol, and PV Zimmermann Stahlbau, and before embarking on his train back to Berlin, he passed by Schletter.
One of the PV mounting system pioneers in Germany, it was back at this year’s Intersolar with a rather big booth in the first row in Hall A5, where it introduced a new flat roof PV system.
Stefan Gelhaar from the sales department explained the product it is more flexible than its predecessor, while the clamps can be fixed at any tilt, allowing the system to be used for different tilt angles. The height of the supports may also be easily adjusted by adding additional pieces.
Overall, the system is very modular to reduce the number of different pieces in the supports.
The good vibes are continuing into day three of Intersolar Europe, as can be witnessed here when Michael Fuhs met Robert Zimmermann, CEO of Zimmermann PV Stahlbau (pictured right). The company is a big PV mounting systems player developing fixed-tilt, tracker, and floating systems for utility-scale solar projects.
This year, Zimmermann says the company will probably ship 1.1 GW worth of mounting systems, comprising 50,000 tons of steel. The PV Zimmermann Stahlbau floating system (also pictured) has been used in Baywa r.e.’s Netherland’s floating PV projects, for example, where around 200 MW have been installed.
Now Zimmermann has installed sensors in its mounting systems to see where they can be optimized and how to reduce the material used. It is also embracing innovations on the PV tracker level, with the company now boasting a tracker system that allows one to install modules vertically – perfect for agriPV projects!
Yesterday, Blake Maitch visited Swedish battery storage manufacturer Nilar to find out about its new nickel metal hydride battery (which, by the way, won the pv magazine energy storage highlights award in 2020!)
Michael Fuhs (pictured left) has now met with CEO Stephan Dörrschuck of Kopp (pictured right), a distributor for Nilar. A one-stop-shop of sorts, one can buy the storage system together with Kostal’s hybrid PV inverter, for example.
The company is also producing its own hardware and software, in addition to developing PV inverters and energy management systems.
Kopp’s strategy is to not only distribute products but also to see where it can add value. This is, according to Dörrschuck, wherever it is possible to control something.
Sax Power was presented one of the three ess awards handed out by the event organizer, which together with Intersolar and two other shows, is called the “The smarter E”.
Technologically, Sax Power’s storage product is highly innovative. The battery, which managing director Lei Shen holds in her hands, integrates power electronics and battery cells. A complicated design of switches, and controlled by a computer, it is used to directly create AC output. Shen told pv magazine’s Michael Fuhs that the challenge was to find less expensive designs – a task with which Sax Power has been successful, she said.
What’s more, according to Shen, this switching technology – based on railway technology – has several advantages compared to conventional lithium-ion battery storage system designs: Her setup allows the aging characteristics of the battery cells to be better controlled, which may result in longer lifetimes. Furthermore, when idle, the battery does not use voltage, which could be a safety advantage.
Shen aims to start using the technology for home storage systems (see the stylish box in the background). In the future, her vision is that it will also be used for electric vehicles. Indeed, she believes it could be used as a solution by German automotive companies, which face the competition of Tesla’s advanced technology. In the past year, Shen has found investors, which have enabled her to build up a small manufacturing base in South Germany.
Our German-language readers can read about the startup in the latest edition of pv magazine Germany.
Much has been made of the good foot traffic, busy booths, and unexpectedly large crowds in Munich over the past three days. But if you look a little closer, behind the booths in some of the halls, one of the reasons for the compression of activity becomes clear.
Hall A5 is a good example: The hall hosted many of the solar manufacturing technology providers, and the place was buzzing. But behind the petitioning lay a cavernous expanse comprised of a whole lotta nothing.
To steal some confectionary marketing: maybe it is the sections of nothing that make it really something.
Michael Fuhs passed by arausol Solartechnik to discover the answer. He met with Henning Wicht (pictured right), who is well known to pv magazine readers in his former capacity as one of the leading solar analysts, previously working for IHS.
He has now joined Arausol as Director of Photovoltaics. The company develops mounting systems and works as an EPC and PV project developer.
CEO Jaime Arau (pictured left) is proud to proclaim that one needs just four screws to build one section of the mounting system table. In his hands, he is showing us a clamp the company has also designed for easy use.
We already reported on K2’s new offer for the Mena region yesterday; however, the company is also addressing German and European solar installers with novelties. Already one year old – but due to Corona the first time at Intersolar – is K2’s pre-mounted version of its Dome 6 system for flat roofs.
Highlighting its time saving properties, Stephan Klopfer, Area Sales Manager, tells pv magazine’s Michael Fuhs, that the pre-mounted system can help shave 50% off the time it takes to install a regular mounting system, e.g., rather than the around one hour it takes to install a normal mounting structure of a 10 kW system, for example, the new K2 product reduces this time by 30 minutes.
To adapt to the fast-changing PV module sizes, the company has enlarged the length of the rail and changed the design of the clamps. And they can also be used to clamp at other positions on the module, which some manufacturers require for their larger formats. The system is now usable for module sizes up to 1.17 by 2.34 meters.
Also helping to reduce installation times, K2 is continuing interfaces of its statistical software planning tool with those of inverter manufacturers. When installers have carried out their statical designs, they can now directly import the design data to the planning tools of Fronius, Goodwe, Kostal, SMA, and Solaredge, which are then used to plan the electrical design.

Two PET backsheet innovators are on the search for end-of-life backsheets to help them close the loop on the material that can be key to PV module durability. Coveme and DuPont Teijin Films have been collaborating on a PET recycling project.
The first stages of the project involved recycling PET plastic bottles into the raw material, which could then be fashioned into new backsheets. DuPont Teijin has pulled off the trick of turning old bottles into precursor PET backsheet material, and it picked up a 2021 Intersolar Award in the process.
Italy’s Coveme stepped in next and has produced backsheets that it says do the trick needed for PV module making. It’s upcycling, but it’s not quite closing the loop when it comes to PV. The two teams are looking for end-of-life modules that can be tested and then the PET backsheet isolated, so that DuPont Teijin and Coveme can then repeat the trick they’ve pulled off with old water bottles.
“We could call it [the project] back-to-back” suggested Steve Davies, from DuPont Teijin. “But It’s actually back-to-backsheet,” added Coveme’s Michele Vannini.
Whatever the name, if you’ve got old modules made of PET backsheets, and can partner on the project, get in touch with Coveme to make circular solar manufacturing a reality.
For many years, companies have been coming up with new monitoring and alarm management platforms. Brand new at this year’s Intersolar Europe, Sens presented its Sensaia solution, as pv magazine’s Michael Fuhs discovered.
The team around Head of Energy Moritz Wickert (left) developed the device using the AI competence of Sens’ parent company Steag – a big player operating in Germany’s coal and gas power plant sectors, among others. Sens, which also builds solar plants globally, is the renewable arm of Steag.
Discontent with existing monitoring solutions, the team developed a new one using the AI data gathered from their existing solar plants. Sensaia now incorporates a “holistic validation” of the many data from them. As a result, all alarms now immediately go through an AI-based quality check based on historical data to eliminate false alarms.
The experts are confident that, among other benefits, the platform correctly predicts the financial losses which arise due to faults or soiling of PV modules. This allows O&M service providers to know when to act. The solution is also sold as a service to other asset managers.
Sensaia is targeted at operators of PV plants above 1 MW in size.
In traditional energy storage solutions, multiple PV modules are connected in a series to a rack, and multiple racks are connected in parallel. Thousands or even tens of thousands of modules are coupled with each other. Thus, if one module fails, the others will be affected.
Blog sponsor Huawei says its solution helps customers avoid this issue and reduce the LCOS by up to 20%. How does it do it? The solution supports battery pack-level and rack-level optimization. Through this, the solution can achieve more refined management, with an accuracy of no more than a dozen batteries. If you’re interested in finding out more, visit B5.510!
As part of the Smarter E Europe Restart 2021, Hydrogen Europe, the German Hydrogen and Fuel-Cell Association DMV, the European Electrolyzer & Fuel Cell Forum EFCF, and Smarter E Europe have combined “to send a clear signal in favor of decarbonization and a sustainable circular economy” through “The Green Hydrogen Manifesto”, writes editor Blake Maitch.
“Against the backdrop of the current realignment in politics, our manifesto aims to encourage decision-makers to factor in green hydrogen – whether in the energy sector or the economics sector,” says Werner Diwald, Chair of the German Hydrogen and Fuel-Cell Association DWV. “Because hydrogen that is produced from renewable sources is not only important for the energy transition. More importantly, it also provides huge opportunities for the economy of the European Union.”
The Manifesto presents 12 action points to the EU, as well as regional policymakers and governments. Actions include:
Well over 50 companies and organizations are already signatories and supporters can still sign the manifesto at ees Europe Restart 2021 until 3:30 pm October 8, or online here.
There’s been a genuinely ebullient mood among production equipment suppliers throughout the three days of Intersolar Europe, with a range of new EU-based PV cell and module projects presenting a wealth of opportunities for production equipment suppliers, according to editor in chief, Jonathan Gifford.
Basque-based production equipment supplier Mondragon Assembly had its new solar head Iñaki Madina on site, and he reported that the company had been swamped with enquiries over the first two days. There had not been even time for lunch, Madina reported – a doubled edged sword, it seems.
Iñaki Madina had taken over from Mondragon’s former solar business head Iñaki Legarda a little less than a year ago, and it was certainly not a case of the lesser of two Iñakis. Madina set out his vision and strategy for supplying the European solar market over the next few years, and it’s comprised of some exciting stuff.
On one side, he sees the future of European manufacturing as being high-tech projects, with a HJT, ECA encapsulant project and an IBC project two recent examples of Mondragon technology projects on display at the booth.
The other component of Mondragon’s strategy is the supply of relatively novel manufacturing concepts, such as automated BIPV module production, and production tools for specialized floating PV and agri-PV projects.
“Our basis to invest in technology with partnerships, in these new technologies, and what we are good at making equipment in which we adapt the new technology,” said Madina. “Our strategy is also focused in niche applications and adapting the solution for the customer.”
Despite being hidden at Fraunhofer ISE institute’s booth, pv magazine’s Cornelia Lichner managed to unearth M10 Industries Business Development Manager, Michael Kroeffges and even CEO Philipp Zahn.
The two can sell you the stringers for their newest shingling matrix technology, which the company developed in close cooperation with Fraunhofer ISE. These devices can interconnect 12,000 cells per hour, which is probably comparable to conventional soldered connections.
The special thing about the shingling matrix is that soiling or a shadow on one point of the module does not affect an entire cell string. Instead, the current can flow around the obstacles. In addition, the shingled modules are aesthetic, with no gaps disturb the picture.
The finished module doesn't have to be square or flat, says Kroeffges. A gently curved car roof is exhibited as proof, which unfortunately reflects too much light for photos, but round or oval modules and even bifacials are also easy to produce, as the manufacturer is not bound by usual cell sizes.
One of the more unusual booths at Intersolar is from copper merchant Gindre, writes pv magazine’s Tristan Rayner. Despite being in the market for close to 200 years, it's Gindre's first time exhibiting at Intersolar.
On offer? Sustainable copper, 100% recycled. Who's interested? Battery companies, with Yves Lembke, Product Manager for E-Mobility, saying he was surprised by the number of battery startups interested in copper for upcoming projects.
Lembke confided to pv magazine it's a game of patience, with initial conversations taking up to a year to develop into orders. And, with demand increasing, Gindre is seeing improving margins after Covid-19 related slowdowns.
Over the past two days, the pv magazine team has scoured the halls of Intersolar, meeting with the established market leaders, the new kids on the block, and the industry’s analysts to bring you the latest PV and energy storage trends from the ground.

Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Australia-based iron ore giant Fortescue Metals Group, said this week that it has purchased a majority stake in High yield Energy Technologies (HyET) Group, which includes solar PV module manufacturing company HyET Solar among its assets.
In addition to the stake acquisition, FFI has also agreed to provide a majority share of financing for a planned expansion of HyET Solar’s solar PV manufacturing plant in the Netherlands. The Dutch company, which manufactures flexible solar modules, has plans to ramp up the production capacity of its Powerfoil technology to 900 MW peak by the end of this year.
Fortescue Future Industries CEO Julie Shuttleworth said that FFI will also look to establish a solar PV module manufacturing facility in Australia. She said the lightweight Powerfoil modules are suitable for high-volume areas, such as utility-scale solar farms, as well as high-value segments such as building-integrated PV.
Shuttleworth said the project has already commenced, but she did not provide any additional details about the proposed manufacturing facility. “We have commenced the design study for a 1 GW Powerfoil factory in Australia and at this scale, we aim to rapidly drive costs down at a greater rate than is achievable with conventional solar PV technology,” she said.
If built, the facility will dwarf the operations of Australia’s only existing solar PV module manufacturer, South Australia-based Tindo Solar. Tindo, which is set to soon commence operations at a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Adelaide’s northern suburbs, has confirmed that production capacity at the AUD 11 million ($8 million) plant will be 150 MW per year.
Shuttleworth said the acquisition of HyET, which also includes HyET Hydrogen among its assets, marks an important milestone in FFI’s vision to produce affordable green hydrogen. It aims to supply 15 million tons of green hydrogen throughout the world by 2030.
“FFI’s goal is to become the world’s leading, fully renewable energy and green products company,” she said. “The addition of HyET Solar and HyET Hydrogen to our portfolio of FFI companies builds on our commitment to develop technologies needed to tackle emissions and global warming.”
Fortescue Chairman Andrew Forrest has previously revealed ambitious plans to build one of the biggest renewable energy portfolios in the world, by delivering more than 235 GW of renewables capacity.
“We are building a portfolio of renewable assets, energy-producing assets around the world,” he said.
Forrest said the HyET acquisition will help to fast-track FFI’s wider ambitions to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2030.
“Green energies need to be available at an industrial, global scale. We don’t have time to wait, we have to act now,” he said. “The technologies of the HyET companies will help us reach that tipping point and the world will begin the journey in earnest to become zero-carbon.”

The 132-cell NewT@N panel is based on 210 mm n-type monocrystalline multi busbars cells with a half-cut design.
The bifacial module can reach a power output of up to 703.6 W and a power conversion efficiency of 23.08%, the company's head of distribution, Juan Molinero García, told pv magazine. “Both results were confirmed by TÜV SÜD in Germany.”
The module is available in five versions with a power output ranging from 680 to 700 W and efficiencies ranging from 21.9 and 22.5%. The open-circuit voltage is between 46.70 and 47.17 V and the short-circuit current is between 18.17 and 18.53 A. “The product shares the same features of the Titan series, such as low voltage and high current,” Molinero García went on to say.
The panel measures 2,384 x 1,303 x 35 mm and weighs in at 35 kg. It is built with a white backsheet, low iron, tempered anti-reflective glass and an anodized aluminum alloy frame. It also features an IP68 enclosure and the maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
The panel has a temperature coefficient of -0.32% per degree Celsius and its operational temperature ranges from -40 to 85 degrees Celsius.
The bifacial comes with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 12-year product guarantee. “The module will be produced starting from the second quarter of next year,” Molinero García stated.
Risen launched its first high-power product in May 2020. The company operates several manufacturing facilities in China and is currently developing a 3 GW cell and module factory in Malaysia.

NanoPV Solar, a New Jersey-based crystalline silicon and thin-film solar panel manufacturer, has announced plans to open up a new production line and distribution facility about 150 miles south of Atlanta.
The company will operate in an existing 56,000-square-foot facility in Americus, Georgia. It will invest an estimated $36 million in the facility, which is expected to create around 500 jobs. Positions will be available in solar manufacturing, quality control, operations and maintenance, research and development, and marketing.
NanoPV operates crystalline silicon and thin-film silicon solar panel manufacturing facilities, as well as solar farms that use its technologies, in a range of global locations.
A recent report from the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE) projected that, within the next five years, Georgia will surpass North Carolina, the long-time leader in installed solar capacity in the southern United States, in both total installed capacity and on a solar watts per customer basis. In 2020, Florida surpassed North Carolina in terms of total installed capacity and South Carolina eclipsed it on the solar watts per customer ratio.
In September 2019, Q Cells opened a new factory in Dalton, Georgia. The facility has the capacity to produce 12,000 PV modules per day and 1.7 GW per year.
NanoPV has yet to reveal the annual production capacity of its new Americus facility.

Solar arrays can often experience faults that go undetected for long periods of time, causing generation and revenue losses. In particular, residential-scale solar projects lack sensing and instrumentation for performance monitoring and fault detection.
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst addressed this issue and developed SunDown, a computer model for residential solar fault detection. The model sidesteps instrumentation and sensors and instead leverages correlations between the power produced by adjacent panels to detect deviations from a panel’s otherwise expected behavior.
The model is also sadi to handle concurrent faults in multiple panels and classify the anomaly to determine the probable cause.
SunDown uses two years of solar generation data both from a real home and from a dataset of historic system faults. The result, the researchers said, is a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 2.98% when predicting panel output.
The researchers said the SunDown model has demonstrated an ability to detect and classify faults–including from snow cover, leaves and debris, and electrical failure–with a  99.13% accuracy. It can also detect multiple concurrent faults with a 97.2% accuracy rate.
Two main models are used in SunDown. One is a linear-regression-based model that takes advantage of the high correlation between adjacent panels. The other is a graphical model using what the researchers called “half-sibling regression,” which is based on a recently proposed machine learning technique.

Melbourne-based BE Power will progress to the next stage of the tender process for the proposed $980 million Big T pumped hydro storage project being developed at the 80,000-megalitre Cressbrook Dam after Toowoomba Regional Council (TRC) agreed to provide the developers with access to council-owned land and water assets.
Toowoomba Region Mayor Paul Antonio said this week the tender process was progressing well and the latest endorsement would allow the council to continue taking steps towards using its land and water assets to generate energy.
“If the project proceeds to delivery, council will provide access to land and water assets and BE Power will develop the project, including providing necessary infrastructure,” he said. The Melbourne-based BE Power is developing the pumped hydro storage project in conjunction with renewable energy heavyweight GE Renewable Energy, a division of France-based General Electric.
BE Power managing director Scott Walkem said the project partners welcomed the council’s latest approval as they progressed work to meet their objectives with construction scheduled to commence in 2023 ahead of commissioning in early 2026. “Having now secured the private land required to deliver the project, we look forward to our continued engagement with the TRC, the state of Queensland, and the federal government’s Underwriting New Generation (UNGI) team as we to work together to deliver the project,” he said.
Walkem said the project would provide long-duration, high-capacity storage, helping to facilitate new wind and solar projects and provide valuable system strength and inertia at a critical point in the National Electricity Market (NEM).
“In an increasingly dynamic power system, long-duration storage (such as pumped hydro) is vital,” he said. “Not only does it help match wind and solar output with actual consumer demand, but it also provides many different grid services required to keep the system stable.
“With significant investment in renewable wind and solar forecast for the Queensland Southern Renewable Energy Zone (QREZ), this project is strategically placed to help unlock the Southern QREZ and ensure it delivers power, jobs and social and economic benefits, not just for locals, but for all Queenslanders.” When generating, the project is expected to provide power equivalent to the demand of about 200,000 typical households.

Antonio said as part of TRC’s latest endorsement for the project, BE Power would now need to demonstrate its alignment with council requirements around water security, community and stakeholders, plus regulatory approvals.
“Water is one of our most precious resources and the proposed project must not adversely affect council’s water security,” he said. “BE Power must also provide a Communication and Stakeholder Engagement Plan before starting community consultation and project approvals must progress through the relevant regulatory bodies.”
The Big T proposal is one of a number of pumped hydro projects in the pipeline in Australia, including the 250 MW Kidston Pumped Hydro Project being developed by Genex Power in far north Queensland.
The Queensland government has also called for tenders for the proposed 1 GW Borumba Dam pumped hydro energy storage project being developed near Gympie in the state’s south-east.
Further south, the New South Wales and federal governments are pushing ahead with the $4.6 billion Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro storage project. The pumped-hydro expansion of the existing Snowy Scheme will provide 2 GW of on-demand generation and 350,000 MWh of large-scale energy storage.
