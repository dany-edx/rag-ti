Its water jet tech is commonly used in the construction sector. It includes a water generation pump and can reportedly discharge high-pressure water with small amounts of water. It also uses an inverter to minimize power consumption.
Shintora Kosan claims that the new patented water jet for solar panels can peel off and pulverize the solar cells and the backsheet by spraying high-pressure water from the module's backside, without damaging the glass. After this process is completed, the glass shows no presence of harmful substances or damages of any kind, the company said, adding that it uses a special filtration device to remove wastewater.
Shintora Kosan said it may now cooperate with Japan-based machinery company Sugino Machine to develop equipment based on its water jet technology. It did not disclose any additional technical details.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/20/new-model-to-predict-safety-of-floating-solar-arrays/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,SOUTH KOREA",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JANUARY 20, 2023",New model to predict safety of floating solar arrays,"Academics from the Korean Institute of Machinery and Materials have developed a safety analysis procedure to judge when different kinds of floating PV arrays are safe to install in the field. They validated their numerical simulations and shared their findings in “Effects of various inlet angle of wind and wave loads on floating photovoltaic system considering stress distributions,” which was recently published in Journal of Cleaner Production.
“We will use these findings to install and operate a floating PV system at the Saemangeum tidal flats, on the coast of the Yellow Sea, on the west coast of South Korea,” researcher Byung-Ju Lim told pv magazine.
The South Korean government is currently developing a 2.1 GW floating solar complex with the support of the Saemangeum Development and Investment Agency (SDIA). The academics built their safety analysis model through three types of numerical simulations: computational fluid dynamic (CFD), hydraulic dynamics analysis, and transient finite element analysis (FEA).
The CFD and hydraulic dynamics simulated the wind and wave loads on the floating PV system. The scientists used FEA to analyze stress distribution on PV systems at various inlet angles for wind and wave loads. They used the results of the numerical simulations to judge the safety of the floating PV arrays.
“If the current design of the floating PV system is judged unsafe, then it can be remodeled to eliminate the weak points. If the design is judged safe, then it can be installed at the desired site,” the researchers explained.
The simulations used a floating PV system consisting of 9 modules, each measuring 1.03 meters by 2.08 meters. The panels had a 15-degree tilt angle. The solar system was supported by 15 floaters made of high-density polyethylene (HPDE).
The scientists validated the CFD results by conducting experiments in at the wind tunnel center of the Chonbuk National University with a wind speed of 12 m/s. The test model was at a 1:15 scale, and thirty pressure taps were installed on the solar panel surfaces to measure the pressure distributions: 15 at the front of the panels, and 15 at the back. Through this experiment, they found that the local maximum error range was 37% and the minimum error 1.7%.
The South Korean team conducted a hydraulic dynamics analysis at a wave pool considering a 1:10 scale model. They found that the local maximum error was 19.4% and the minimum error 0.6%. The scientists also tested the area-averaged drag coefficients (CD) on the solar panels at various inlet angles, the displacement of the unit floating PV system under the regular wave condition, and the stress distribution for floating installations.
“The results confirmed that the stress distribution on the solar panels, supporting frames, and floating bodies did not exceed the yield strengths of the constituent materials,” the researchers concluded. “Thus, the unit floating PV system was safe under the wind and wave conditions considered.”
The results also point to potential safety and cost-improvement strategies for floating solar. “Installing a windshield instead of solar panels at the edge of the PV array could reduce the load and improve safety,” the scientists said, noting that the results show that the first and last rows of the solar panels are exposed to higher wind loads.
Developers could also reduce system costs by replacing the HDPE floaters in the middle of systems with medium-density polyethylene (MDPE) floaters, which are around 20% cheaper, according to the academics. This is supported by the results of hydraulic dynamics analysis, which show that the sheltering effect reduced the loads on the middle of the floating PV system by 32% to 54% compared to the edges.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/20/greek-utility-reaches-financial-close-on-230-mw-of-solar-at-former-coal-mine/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,GREECE",ILIAS TSAGAS,"JANUARY 20, 2023",Greek utility reaches financial close on 230 MW of solar at former coal mine,"The EIB has revealed plans to provide €28.5 million of financing to Greek state-owned utility PPC. The EIB said the funds will reach a maximum of €35 million in the months ahead, which PPC Renewables, the renewables unit of the PPC, will spend on the construction of three solar farms, totaling 230 MW.
The EIB financing comprises “part of a €102.4 million project finance debt package comprising of €95.1 million long term facilities and €7.3 million medium term construction VAT financing,” the bank said in a press release. Specifically, the EIB, which is the European Union’s financing entity, worked together with Greece’s Eurobank and National Bank of Greece, which together provided 70% of the long-term facilities and 100% of the medium-term VAT financing.
The EIB’s loan stems from the InvestEU program, which brings all EU financial instruments together under one roof, to improve the financing of green projects in a timely, efficient manner. As such, the loan is backed by an EU budget guarantee of €26.2 billion.
In 2021, the EIB had also signed an agreement with the Greek finance ministry to help manage up to €5 billion as part of Greece’s implementation of the national recovery and resilience plan, which is the EU’s post-pandemic recovery plan. The bank has said the loan is supporting three solar farms totaling 230 MW. pv magazine understands this is a cluster featuring a 200 MW solar park alongside two smaller solar farms, each with 15 MW of capacity, in Ptolemaida, a mining region.
The three projects are referred to separately because they have won separate contracts in Greece’s previous rounds of renewable energy tenders. Thus, the 200 MW project won a tariff of €0.04911/kWh in a tender held in 2020 and the two smaller projects were also awarded contracts in separate tenders.
PPC Renewables Chief Executive Konstantinos Mavros told pv magazine that the two smaller projects totaling 30 MW were connected to the grid in March, while the larger 200 MW project will be connected to the grid within the next 60 to 90 days.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/20/flexible-cadmium-telluride-solar-cell-with-12-6-efficiency-via-lift-off-method/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 20, 2023",Flexible cadmium telluride solar cell with 12.6% efficiency via lift-off method,"Researchers at the University of Toledo in the United States have developed a flexible CdTe solar cell through a water-assisted lift-off approach, including an additional cadmium chloride treatment for the cell's cadmium sulfide (CdS) film.
“These are lightweight and flexible solar cells that can especially install on any curve surface or electric device and, most importantly, they are good for space applications,” researcher Sandip Singh told pv magazine.
The scientists described the water-assisted lift-off method as a low-cost fabrication process to offer advantages such as lower stress in CdTe films and ambient operation temperature. The lift-off approach consists of different photolithography techniques for creating a photoresist profile that ensures separation between the thin film coating in desired and undesired areas of a give pattern. It includes washing away the photoresist to leave behind the film in the patterned area.
They used cleaved mica sheets as a mediator substrate for the solar cell and a CdS buffer layer with thickness of 100 nm. They also applied a cadmium chloride (CdCl2) vapor treatment to the cadmium sulfide (CdS) film before CdTe deposition and a second CdCl2 treatment after CdTe deposition.
“A 3.5 μm CdTe absorber layer was deposited by the closed space sublimation method with a source temperature of 580 C and a substrate temperature of 520 C in a 1% oxygen and 99% argon environment,” they explained.
The academics dried the peeled film with a nitrogen jet and deposited a transparent conduction oxide indium zinc oxide (IZO) layer as a front contact.
“In this process, the mica sheet serves only to grow CdS and CdTe films, after the delamination mica sheet is not a part of the solar cell,” they said.
They said the process results in a higher cristallinity of the films. They found that the average grain size of the CdS film without additional CdCl2 treatment is much smaller than that with additional CdCl2 treatment. This means that the CdS film has a higher conductivity.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 12.60%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.829 V, a short-circuit current density of 23.64 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 64.30%. The group described this efficiency value as highest reported among all flexible CdTe solar cells fabricated by the lift-off technique.
“The additional CdCl2 treatment on the CdS layer significantly improves the open-circuit voltage and fill while the improvement of short-circuit current density is negligible,” the researchers said. They described the novel cell technology in “Water-Assisted Lift-Off Process for Flexible CdTe Solar Cells,” which was recently published in ACS Publications.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/20/romania-reduces-vat-on-residential-solar-to-5/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,ROMANIA",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JANUARY 20, 2023",Romania reduces VAT on residential solar to 5%,"Romania has passed a reduction in VAT for solar modules from 19% to 5%.
“The law does not provide any installation size limit in order to benefit from the reduction,” Mihaela Nyerges, partner at Nyerges & Partners, told pv magazine.
The measure only applies to PV panels for residential homes or public buildings belonging to central or local authorities or entities. Commercial companies are excluded from the tax cuts. The VAT reduction also applies to solar thermal panels, installation kits, and low-emission heat pumps.
The incentives are expected to increase solar uptake across Romania and boost self-consumption. Amid rising energy prices, the country has seen a sharp increase in prosumers since it introduced more favorable net metering provisions in 2022. Romania is also supporting rooftop PV deployment via the Casa Verde Fotovoltaice (green PV home) scheme.
“The VAT reduction will stimulate even more the already growing market, although we can expect that the VAT reduction will be passed only partially to consumers due to rising demand,” said Nyerges.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Romania had 1,398 MW of solar installed by the end of 2021.

The Chinese battery and inverter supplier has described the N1 HV inverters as high-voltage devices with high efficiency and reliability.
“The hybrid inverter supports 150% oversized PV power,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
They can work with existing on-grid inverters, regardless of the brand, and can also operate without batteries, which customers are free to add, according to the company. The inverters are available in four versions, with power outputs ranging from 3 kW to 6 kW. The devices measure 506 mm x 386 mm x 170 mm and weigh in at 20 kg.
The new products have efficiency ratings ranging from 97.42% to 97.50% and a European efficiency rating of 97.15% to 97.20%. They feature two maximum power point tracking (MPPT) points, with MPPT voltage range between 120 V to 550 V. The maximum PV power input is 4.5 kW for the 3kW inverters and 9 kW for the 6 kW devices. The maximum input voltage is 600 V.
The inverters have an operating temperature range of -35 C to 60 C and IP66-rated protection. They are certified for the European market by TUV Rheinland and for the Brazilian market by INMETRO. They feature lithium-ion batteries with voltages ranging from 80 V to 450 V, with a maximum charge/discharge current of 25 A.
“The RENAC hybrid inverter is very flexible, working in different residential scenarios by selecting from the five working modes, including self-use Mode, force time use mode, backup mode, feed-in-use mode, and EPS mode,” the company said.

Rajasthan-based Rays Power Infra has switched on a 275 MW DC solar project in Sundarganj, Bangladesh. The installation is purportedly the single largest PV plant in the South Asian country. It is also the single largest PV array that Rays Power Infra has ever commissioned.
The plant is spread across 600 acres of land. It will offset over 375 billion tons of CO2 emissions over its lifetime, said Rays Power Infra. The company completed the project within the scheduled time frame of 14 months, despite a challenging execution environment and difficult soil and weather conditions.
The company is now focusing on establishing more such power plants in Bangladesh and other countries. Prior to the deployment of the PV facility, Bangladesh had 950 MW of renewable energy capacity, with 716 MW coming from solar.
Rising fuel prices in Bangladesh have recently forced the government to shut down a number of diesel-run power plants, in order to cut spending of the nation’s foreign-currency reserves. Dipal C Barua, president of the Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association, said more renewable energy is the only way to overcome the electricity crisis.

Investments in the US renewable energy market are expected to hit $114 billion by 2031,  up 78% from $64 billion in total investments at the end of 2021, buoyed by decarbonization momentum from the landmark US Inflation Reduction Act. Wood Mackenzie provides an initial assessment in its latest report on how the IRA will greatly support the expansion of US renewable energy equipment manufacturing capacity.
“The IRA will completely reshape the renewables supply chain in the US, incentivizing the reopening of shuttered facilities as well as provide opportunities to build entire equipment supply chains from scratch,” said Daniel Liu, head of asset commercial performance at Wood Mackenzie.
Two key provisions of the IRA are likely to be game changing for equipment manufacturers. The first is the advanced manufacturing production credits (AMPC) for US-made renewables equipment. The second provision is the incentivization of developers of US renewable energy projects to purchase domestically sourced equipment with an additional tax credit. To qualify, 40% of all equipment must be American made for projects installed before 2025, and 20% American-made for offshore wind projects. This requirement rises to 55% beginning in 2027 for the offshore wind market, the report notes.
“It’s high stakes for US equipment sales, as the IRA provides incentives that cut the manufacturing cost of solar panels, storage equipment and wind towers in the US by anywhere from 4% to 30%,” Liu said. “This, along with tariffs on some imports, potentially puts domestic manufacturing on a cost-competitive footing with imported equipment.”
