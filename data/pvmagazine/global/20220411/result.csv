Bhavana Sri Pullagura, a senior power analyst at GlobalData, attributes the expected growth of the battery storage market to a “fall in battery technology prices, increasing need for grid stability, and resilience of the integration of renewable power in the power market.” 
China, one of the fastest-growing economies, is expected to lead the global battery energy storage market with a $4.04 billion share in 2026. A mammoth target of 1,200 GW of wind and solar capacity will provide considerable growth opportunities to the energy storage market over the forecast period.

South Korea, the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom will be the major markets due to supportive regulations and incentives. Other countries will also see rapid growth in demand for electricity and the wider use of renewable integration. 
Over the last decade, countries have been aggressively promoting grid modernization and enhancing the grid's ability to meet present and future requirements. Additionally, batteries are being deployed to aid smart grids, integrate renewables, create responsive electricity markets, provide ancillary services, and enhance system resilience and energy self-sufficiency.
“GlobalData believes that encouraging policies and high electricity charges are also nudging the market to renewables and storage plus renewables at the end consumer level,” said Pullagura. “As the power sector evolves to accommodate new technologies and adapt to varying market trends, energy storage will play a crucial role in the transition and transformation of the power sector.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/11/us-government-may-not-wrap-up-pv-anti-circumvention-probe-until-august-says-roth/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 11, 2022","US government may not wrap up PV anti-circumvention probe until August, says ROTH","From pv magazine USA
The US Department of Commerce (DoC) has launched an antidumping and anticircumvention investigation in four Southeast Asian countries that supply 80% of the nation’s solar panels.
If violations are found, a 50% to 250% tariff can be placed on solar panels entering the United States. Module prices can represent 50% or more of a project’s cost, so for a $300 million utility-scale project, that’s as much as $375 million in risk. What’s more, the fee is retroactive to the February 8th petition by Auxin Solar led DoC to launch the investigation.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that roughly 75% of companies report canceled or delayed module supply, 50% said that 80% or more of their 2022 project pipelines are at risk.
In his industry note, Philip Shen, managing director, ROTH Capital Partners, wrote that “the module procurement process has been turned upside down.” He continued to share that some solar developers may be willing to take on the risk and continue to procure and deploy, but that activity will mostly occur in the distributed generation space rather than the utility-scale. “Our AntiCirc checks this week suggest C-Si utility scale module volume for the rest of the year may largely shut off,” said the note.
Shen’s team believes the DoC will take the full 150 days it is allotted to make a determination on the case, which places the deadline on Aug. 26. He notes that the passing of Senator Jon Ossoff’s (D-Georgia) Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act may play a role in the determination.
The note added that mid-week, facilities in Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia had started to reduce production. Shen’s team also noted an increase in power purchase agreement prices and a trend of smaller developers reselling projects to larger developers.
Costs are particularly rising in the distributed generation space, with pricing skyrocketing to $0.607/W to $0.70/W, rising from last year’s $0.40/W to $0.50/W/ This translates to residential end-user costs rising from $4/W to $4.50/W to nearly $6/W, said ROTH.
““American workers will bear the pain of the decision to allow one rogue antagonist (Auxin Solar) to abuse and manipulate trade laws for their own gain,” American Clean Power Association CEO Heather Zichal said in reaction to the investigation. “The 230,000 proud Americans who work in the solar industry are calling on President Biden and Secretary Raimondo to reverse their decision and bring this matter to a speedy conclusion. Every day this investigation hangs over the solar community is a day of lost jobs and postponed solar projects critical to the administration’s climate agenda.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/11/storing-renewables-in-depleted-oil-and-gas-wells/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 11, 2022",Storing renewables in depleted oil and gas wells,"Researchers from the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) are proposing the use of horizontal gas and oil wells to store renewable energy via compressed natural gas.
The scientists initially considered injecting renewable-powered compressed air into old wells, but they chose natural gas because of its compatibility with existing reservoirs.
“We want to start the program with natural gas because it’s easy and I think the people who own the wells, they’d get on board a lot easier,” said NREL researcher David Young. “Eventually, as you prove out the idea, you gradually shift over to a different gas to run the system. CO2 would work. Nitrogen would work. Hydrogen. If you use CO2 that could also be part of a carbon-capture cycle.”
In particular, the US group recommended hydraulically fractured (“fracked”) projects, which account for about 75% of all newly drilled wells in the United States. “The number of active horizontal wells has jumped from about 9,000 in 2,000 to more than a quarter-million in 2017,” said NREL.
The academics evaluated the potential storage of large-scale renewables capacity as compressed natural gas, to be released to spin an electrical generator when electrical demand is high. They described their findings in “Electrical energy storage using compressed gas in depleted hydraulically fractured wells,” which was recently published in iScience. They referred to their technology as “REpurposed FRAcked wells for Energy Storage” (REFRAES).
They proposed the use of unconventional shale and tight sandstone dry gas wells that have been fracked and depleted. Renewable energy could be used to compress natural gas for storage in the wells. The heat generated by the compression process could also be stored for later use.

“The ability to predict and control injection and production of natural gas into and from a shale reservoir through a hydraulically fractured well is one of the most important and challenging aspects of the REFRAES concept,” they emphasized, noting that the shale wells must be able to sustain gas flow rates of several million standard cubic feet per day. “The gas injection occurs near the natural reservoir temperature, pressure, and flow rate, so reservoir deterioration is unlikely.”
The proposed energy storage cycle model is expected to be implemented in four phases: an injection phase, a storage phase, an electricity production phase, and a recovery period. During the recovery period, the well is shut in. The research group assumed that each of these phases would be equal in time duration, although the scheme might not be the most efficient way to cycle the reservoir.
The scientists chose two different configuration for short-term or long-term storage. For the first one, the cycle takes 24 hours to complete, with each phase lasting six hours. For the second option, each phase lasts 90 days and the entire cycle takes 360 days. “These are arbitrary storage cycles chosen for convenience. Actual storage and production durations will be market-driven,” they said.
Through their analysis, the scientists found that these storage facilities may achieve a round-trip storage efficiency of between 40% and 70% depending on the natural reservoir temperature. They said renewables stores in wells may also achieve a levelized cost of storage (LCOS) ranging from $70 and 270/MWh, a value which they describe as on par with pumped hydro storage. They also estimated that these facilities may be built at a cost of $1,000 to $3,500 per kilowatt installed.
“The low LCOS values are due to the reuse of existing infrastructure, including a de-risked reservoir, low capital expenditures for additional needed equipment, and utilizing the geothermal energy of the reservoir to maintain the thermodynamic state of the compressed gas,” the scientists concluded. “In all, REFRAES is shown to be a viable technology for energy storage with high RTE, low LCOS, and ability to be expanded in scale to meet grid-scale storage needs.”

“With this work, we show that the scaling-up of high efficient perovskite solar cells to modules is possible without penalizing the efficiency and keeping the hysteresis index low,” researcher Aldo di Carlo told pv magazine. 
The manufacturing temperature never exceeds 150 C. This represents an additional step to the industrial exploitation of perovskite photovoltaic technology.
The module was built with 0.09 square-centimeter solar cells. The perovskite solution was deposited at 2,000 rpm with 10 seconds ramp-up to fully cover the substrate without persisting at this speed to prevent the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent from sticking onto the substrate.
“This is avery crucial point, because DMSO was trapped during  film formation and formed voids at perovskite-substrate interface, as it has been recently demonstrated for a different p–i–n architecture,” the scientists said. “Moreover, to avoid cracks on the perovskite film, it is very crucial that the velocity of the antisolvent dripping and the distance between substrate and pipet tip.”
The solar module achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency of 19.11% and a stabilized efficiency of 18.7%.
“The reported simple and reproducible method represents an outstanding baseline to be transferred to large-area modules (size ≥100 cm 2 ) by scalable full fabrication procedure out of glove box,” the researchers concluded.
They described their design in “Hysteresis-free Planar Perovskite Solar Module with 19.1% Efficiency by Interfacial Defects Passivation,” which was recently published in RRL Solar. The research group includes scientists from the University of Tor Vergata in Rome, Belgian research institute Imec, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL).

Su and his colleagues have noted the importance of using radiative cooling as a cooling agent for solar panels, but also to extend the operation of PV-thermal modules at night.
“The thermal-to-power efficiency of a solar thermal power plant can be increased by dropping the condensing temperature with an additional radiative cooling strategy,” they explained.
The researchers identified all useful radiative cooling strategies for PV cooling. They stressed the importance of the cooler in reducing a solar cell's operating temperature without affecting its overall power conversion efficiency. However, several radiative cooling techniques use radiative coolers atop the solar cells, which results in optical losses, they said.
They highlighted the need to evaluate the performance of radiative cooling in solar cells by comparing it with the original encapsulated solar cell. They also noted the importance of setting clear comparison benchmarks.
“Simply comparing the PV efficiency, thermal efficiency, and radiative cooling flux reported in different studies is unfair and insignificant since the material, environmental, and operating conditions are different,” they said. “For instance, radiative cooling is preferable in arid and high-altitude areas, involuntarily resulting in a greater cell-temperature reduction for a PV cell or a higher net radiative cooling flux for a PT-RC collector in these regions.”
They looked at the accessibility, scalability, and reliability of the materials used in radiative cooling systems and found that the polyethylene film used in PV applications may not be resistant enough for long-term outdoor operation.
“Future researches should attach primary importance to alternative cover with better mechanical strength and weatherability,” they said.
They presented their findings in “Applications of radiative sky cooling in solar energy systems: Progress, challenges, and prospects,” which was recently published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Review. The research group includes academics from the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom and the University of Science and Technology of China.
Radiative cooling occurs when the surface of an object absorbs less radiation from the atmosphere and emits more. As a result, the surface loses heat and a cooling effect can be achieved without the need for power. Radiative cooling was recently applied to solar panel cooling by researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China, Purdue University in the United States, the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales in Spain, and the Jordan University of Science and Technology and the Australian College of Kuwait.

As the second-largest power utility in Bosnia and Herzegovina, ERS currently owns and operates a 300 MW coal-fired power plant in Ugljevik, as well as other hydroelectric power plants. The Koncar Electric Engineering Institute said the coal plant is classified as a supercritical power station. It sources 1.8 million tons of lignite coal per year from the nearby Gacko coal mine, which is operated by Gacko Mine and Power.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) said in 2018 that the Balkan countries are home to a largely underdeveloped renewable energy market. However, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia still largely rely on lignite coal capacity, which covers between 65% and 75% of their net generation. That said, they have all recently implemented plans to increase the share of renewables in their respective national electricity mixes.
