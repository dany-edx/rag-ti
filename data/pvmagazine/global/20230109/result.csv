GPE built the project on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis, after winning a bid in Myanmar’s second tender for utility-scale PV projects. The country’s second tender was launched in June 2021 – just a few months after Myanmar’s military coup in February. It was aimed at independent power producers (IPP) and BOO projects. Myanmar launched its first solar tender in May 2020.
The Taung Daw Gwin project features 45,980 PV modules from an undisclosed manufacturer and 1,500 V string inverters from Chinese manufacturer Sungrow. While PV projects tendered in Myanmar’s second tender are moving ahead, reports from exiles point to problems related to the construction of large-scale solar projects that were allocated in the first tender. Sungrow secured a project in the 2020 tende, but it was canceled in April 2022, for example.
The new facility is expected to generate 25.1 MW of electricity per year, according to a statement by GPE. It is linked to the Taung Daw Gwin substation and is connected to the Burmese grid via a 33 kV transmission line that the company built.
“GPE is deeply committed to infrastructure development and sustainability in Myanmar,” said GPE’s Managing Director U Zaw Win. “This and other renewable energy projects we are involved in will increase the contribution of renewable energy to the national grid while advancing the country’s national electrification goals.”
The company also commissioned the Thapyay Wa solar project in Myanmar in December 2021, with a total installed capacity of 30 MW. According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Myanmar had an installed PV capacity of 80 MW by the end of 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/09/sun-tracking-vs-fixed-vehicle-integrated-pv/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UKRAINE,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JANUARY 9, 2023",Sun-tracking vs. fixed vehicle-integrated PV,"Academics from universities in Ukraine, Latvia, and Slovakia have assessed the impact of vehicle-integrated photovoltaics (VIPV) on electric vehicle mileage. They used a 2017 Volkswagen e-Golf 7 series EV in Kyiv to determine the distance that solar electricity could power it on a single, full charge of its battery. They compared the results of a fixed VIPV system to a single-axis tracking system.
The group determined that the vehicle’s available rooftop area was 1,468 mm x 1,135 mm. Based on those dimensions, they assumed the car’s roof could accommodate two 120 W solar panels and one 50 W monocrystalline module from Chinese manufacturer Xinpuguang. They connected the three panels in parallel, resulting in a maximum power of 257.92 W.
The researchers then calculated PV electricity generation on typical days in January, April, July and October. Using data from car tests by the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the academics compared the additional distance the EV could travel using solar energy. They assumed the solar modules could only charge the EV batteries while parked.
The results show that the fixed-VIPV system could produce 1,587 Wh of electricity in July, allowing the EV to travel 7.98 km according to the EPA standard, or 12.64 km according to the NEDC.
“These are 3.99% and 6.32% of the maximum range of the trip on a full charge of the battery, respectively,” the scientists said. In January, the fixed system produces 291 Wh, or a range of 1.55 km (EPA) and 2.32 km (NEDC), 0.77% and 1.16% of the maximum range, respectively.
The tracking system produces the same energy as the fixed system in summer, but its yield is superior in spring, autumn, and winter. The best results were in January, when the EV could travel 3.01 km (EPA) or 4.52 km (NEDC), which corresponds to 1.51% and 2.26% of the maximum possible mileage on a single battery charge, respectively.
“The real advantages can be lower than the ones provided … due to the energy spent to adjust the sun-tracking roof platform and to possible constraints preventing perfect orientation,” the authors noted.
While the tracking VIPV system powers the EV for an extra 1.46 km to 2.2 km in January, the solution’s LCOE is 40% higher than the fixed-tilt system’s, the scientists claimed. According to their calculation, the LCOE of the PV system with zero degrees inclination is $0.6654/kWh. For a system with 20 or 80 degrees of inclination, the LCOE is $1.1013/kWh. The payback time of each system is 5.32 and 5.07 years, respectively.
“Given the small difference in the [payback period], an ordinary EV's driver can be satisfied with the system without inclination adjustment, since a sun-tracking roof platform requires significantly higher initial investment expenditures and makes more difficult the installation,” the scientists concluded.
The scientists described their findings in “Application of photovoltaic panels in electric vehicles to enhance the range,” which was recently published in Heliyon.

The French Ministry of the Ecological Transition has published the results of a tender for innovative PV technologies under the nation's new PPE2 tendering mechanism, which was launched in late 2021.
The authorities allocated 172.9 MW of solar power in the procurement exercise. They originally planned to assign just 140 MW, including 60 MW of ground-mounted installations ranging in size from 500 kW to 3 MW, and 80 MW of rooftop projects with capacities ranging from 100 kW to 3 MW.
The second category includes agrivoltaics, solar carports, and other innovative rooftop arrays. Overall, the ministry selected 66 projects, including 30 for the first category (around 80 MW) and 36 for the second (around 92 MW).
French consultancy Finergreen notes that Urbasolar led in the total number of projects, with 14 innovative PV plants on the ground, or 40.1 MW of capacity. With 12 projects in the 2nd category, for 32.9 MW, Sun’R / Rgreen came in second place. TotalEnergies Renouvelables had 6 MW, followed by Corsica Sole with 15 MW, Iberdrola with 12 MW, Générale du Solaire with 11 MW, and Technique Solaire with 7.4 MW. Eleven other developers also obtained approximately 6 MW of projects.
The list includes a very large number of 3 MW projects. Finergreen said “the average size of projects is 2.6 MW and that, surprisingly, it is similar in the two eligible categories.” It also noted that the average allocated tariff of €0.08446 ($0.090)/kWh was much lower than the maximum tariffs set by French regulator of €0.120/kWh and €0.15/kWh.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/09/photocatalytic-water-splitting-with-9-2-solar-to-hydrogen-efficiency/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"JANUARY 9, 2023",Photocatalytic water splitting with 9.2% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency,"University of Michigan researchers developed a new photocatalytic water splitting system that is reportedly able to reach a 9.2% solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency.
The proposed system uses the higher energy part of the solar spectrum to split water and the lower part of the spectrum to provide heat that encourages the reaction. The extra heat also allows the hydrogen and oxygen to remain separate, rather than renewing their bonds and forming water once more.
It works in an indoor environment and uses pure water, concentrated solar light, and an indium gallium nitride photocatalyst. The semiconductor catalyst, a forest of nanowires of indium gallium nitride grown onto a silicon surface, is able to become more efficient during use, according to the scientists. The device absorbs photons and converts them into electrons, which are used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.
The nanowires are peppered with nanoscale balls of metal, 1/2000th of a millimeter across, that use those electrons and holes, positively charged gaps left behind when electrons are liberated by the light, to help direct the reaction.
“A simple insulating layer atop the panel keeps the temperature at a toasty 75 C, or 167 F – warm enough to help encourage the reaction while also being cool enough for the semiconductor catalyst to perform well,” the scientists said.
They claim that the system is nearly 10 times more efficient than other solar water-splitting systems of the same kind. They said that the final cost of hydrogen could fall with a bigger semiconductor.
“We reduced the size of the semiconductor by more than 100 times compared to some semiconductors only working at low light intensity,” said researcher Peng Zhou.
The research group described the system in the study “Solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of more than 9% in photocatalytic water splitting,” published in Nature.
“This temperature-dependent strategy also leads to an STH efficiency of about 7 % from widely available tap water and sea water and an STH efficiency of 6.2% in a large-scale photocatalytic water-splitting system with a natural solar light capacity of 257 watts,” they said.
They claimed that the next challenge is to further improve the efficiency and generate ultra-high purity hydrogen that can be directly fed into fuel cells.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/09/neoen-starts-building-fifth-big-battery-in-australia/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 9, 2023",Neoen starts building fifth big battery in Australia,"From pv magazine Australia
French renewable energy and battery storage company Neoen said it had given notice to proceed to a EPC consortium comprising Italy-based storage specialist NHOA Energy and Spanish infrastructure development group Elecnor, signaling the start of construction for its 200 MW/400 MWh Blyth Battery project.
The 200 MW/400 MWh battery is being built next to the Blyth West substation in South Australia’s mid-north and will be linked to ElectraNet’s transmission network. NHOA Energy will be the battery storage specialist in the consortium, while Elecnor will act as balance-of-plant contractor.
In line with its develop-to-own business model, Neoen will be the long-term owner and operator of the Blyth Battery. The asset is expected to commence operating in 2025.
Neoen said the system will mainly be deployed to supply 70 MW of “renewable energy baseload” power to BHP as part of a contract to help power the miner’s Olympic Dam operations. The battery will be used to firm the production of Neoen’s 412 MW Goyder South Stage I wind farm, the first phase of the planned Goyder Renewables Zone, a hybrid wind, solar and storage project that has development approval for a total of 1200 MW of wind generation, 600 MW of solar generation and 900 MW of battery storage capacity.
The Blyth Battery, which received the support of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) Large Scale Battery Storage Funding Round, will ultimately be equipped with grid-forming inverter technology, allowing it to provide essential system strength services and inertia which have historically been provided by baseload coal and gas power plants.
“Battery storage is an essential technology in the transition to renewable energy, allowing us to smooth out variable generation and store electricity for when it’s needed,” ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said. “Next generation grid-scale batteries will underpin this transition, with inverter technology that can maintain grid stability without fossil fuels.”
Neoen Chairman and CEO Xavier Barbaro said the Blyth Battery will also demonstrate the potential of renewable generation coupled with energy storage as the future of Australia’s baseload power supply.
“We are delighted to be building our second storage asset in South Australia, the state where we delivered the world’s first big battery back in 2017,” he said. “Blyth Battery will play an essential role in providing 24/7 energy, serving as a template for future baseload contracts for our customers, both in Australia and in our other countries.”
The Blyth Battery is Neoen’s fifth big battery in Australia, elevating the company’s total Australian assets close to 3 GW in operation or under construction with its storage portfolio approaching 1 GW.
“Neoen is now operating at the gigawatt scale in storage, making us one of the leading global players in batteries and one of the true accelerators of the energy transition,” Barbaro said.
Neoen, whose 150 MW/194 MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia was the first grid-scale storage project in the country, also owns and operates the 300 MW/450 MWh Victorian Big Battery and is building the 100 MW/200 MWh Capital Battery in the Australian Capital Territory and the 200 MW/400 MWh Western Downs Battery in Queensland.
The company has also received state government approval to build a stand-alone 1 GW/4 GWh battery near the town of Collie in Western Australia and is pursuing plans to develop a 200 MW/400 MWh battery facility to be built near Chittering in the state’s Wheatbelt region. Neoen is also developing a 500 MW/1000 MWh battery near Wallerawang in New South Wales.

The Renewable Power Plant Database for Africa (RePP Africa) features 1,074 hydropower projects, 1,128 solar plants, and 276 wind power assets. It provides geographic coordinates, construction status, and capacity for each of them.
“RePP Africa lists more renewable power plants with cumulated capacity,” said the scientists.
They removed canceled projects and added new plants that were not identified by previous databases. They then georeferenced all data records.
“Data records were compiled and processed from various sources for all African countries,” the scientists stated. “Most solar power plants (1072) are operating or proposed as photovoltaic (PV), 47 as concentrated solar power (CSP), and 9 as concentrator photovoltaics (CPV) type plants.”
The database currently shows that in Africa there are 411 solar projects totaling 10.56 GW that are in operation or under construction and 717 solar facilities under development with a combined capacity of 53.32 GW.
The researchers presented the database in “RePP Africa – a georeferenced and curated database on existing and proposed wind, solar, and hydropower plants,” which was recently published in Scientific Data. The research team includes academics from the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen, the University of Osnabrück, and the Senckenberg Society for Nature Research.
“The contemporary, curated database on renewable power plants (existing, under construction, proposed) in African countries will enable the research community to address and fill current research gaps and to advance integrated renewable energy modeling,” they concluded.
In November, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) published a dataset with 10,905 sites for PV deployment across Africa, with an estimated total capacity of 4.9 TW.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/09/austria-deployed-more-than-1-4-gw-of-new-solar-in-2022/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,AUSTRIA",ROLAND ERNST,"JANUARY 9, 2023",Austria deployed more than 1.4 GW of new solar in 2022,"Austria has joined the group of nations that have installed at least 1 GW of solar capacity in a single year.
Figures from the local solar association, PV Austria, show that 1.4 GW of PV were newly installed last year. “The final results will be available only from next summer,” a PV Austria spokesperson told pv magazine.
Austria installed 740 MW of new PV systems in 2021, 341 MW in 2020, and 247 MW in 2019. If the new figures for 2022 are confirmed, it means the country reached 4.2 GW cumulative PV capacity at the end of December. According to previous estimates by SolarPower Europe, Austria was not expected to become a gigawatt market last year.
The Austrian federal government created the framework under a new renewable energy law (EAG) to facilitate the rapid expansion of photovoltaics, but implementation also depends a lot on the federal states. In Lower Austria, for example, the state government has raised the expansion target to 3 GW by 2030, but it also reduced the area for solar parks that are larger than 2 hectares.
“PV zoning should be used more as a weapon against the energy crisis and high electricity prices. Regrettably, however, the areas for solar power systems have been reduced and so the photovoltaic target will certainly not be achieved,” says Herbert Paierl, the chairman of PV Austria.
It is unclear how many of the designated zones can actually be used. This is due to competing land uses, pending nature conservation reviews, complex ownership structures, and a lack of power grid capacities.
“The task of the future Lower Austrian provincial government will be, on the one hand, to carry out close monitoring of the actual land use and, on the other hand, to quickly designate further zones for solar power production,” said Paierl.

In the first procurement exercise, the Tunisian authorities are seeking proposals to build eight solar plants with capacities of 100 MW. Developers will be responsible for identifying and securing land for the projects.
The tender will be held across four different rounds. The deadline to submit project proposals for the first round has been set for June 15, 2023. For the fourth and final round, the submission date has been set for an unspecified date in September 2025.
In the second tender, the Tunisian government wants to facilitate the construction of two 100 MW solar plants in Hecha, in Gabes governorate, and Khobna, in Sidi Bouzid governorate. 
Interested developers will until May 18 to submit their proposals. The government did not reveal any other details about the procurement exercises. The selected projects will likely sell electricity to Société tunisienne de l’électricité et du gaz (STEG), the Tunisian state-owned grid operator, under long-term power purchase agreements.
Tunisia is supporting utility-scale solar through a series of 70 MW tenders. It also finalized a 500 MW solar tender in December 2019. The country's cumulative installed PV capacity stood at just 95 MW by the end of 2021, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
