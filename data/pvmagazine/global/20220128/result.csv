Ultimately, the EU-supported project is expected to have a production capacity of around 400 kilograms of green hydrogen per day, which will be stored in a salt cavern on the site that is currently used for natural gas storage. The initial storage capacity will be 2 to 3 tonnes of green hydrogen, but could eventually reach almost 44 tonnes by mobilizing the full capacity of the site.
Oslo-based Yara and Germany's Linde Engineering signed a contract for the construction and delivery of a green hydrogen demonstration plant at Yara’s ammonia production facility at Herøya Industripark in Porsgrunn, Norway. “The project, which is supported by a NOK 283 million (€ 28.3 million) grant from Enova (announced in December 2021), will demonstrate that ammonia produced using renewable energy can reduce the impact of carbon dioxide in fertilizer production,” the company wrote on Friday. This will be the second 24 MW PEM electrolysis plant designed and constructed by Linde Engineering; the first is now being built at the Leuna Chemical Complex in Germany. The project aims to supply the first green ammonia products as early as mid-2023. The plant will reportedly have an annual capacity of around 10,000 kg/day of hydrogen.
Oslo-based maritime hydrogen bunkering solutions company Hyon, whose majority owners include Nel, Norwegian Hydrogen and Saga Pure, completed a private placement of NOK 50 million, valuing the company at NOK 130 million (€13 million). The company intends to soon have its shares admitted to trading on Euronext Growth. “Hyon is filling an important gap in the value chain critical in making hydrogen a success within maritime applications, both domestically in Norway and beyond,” Nel CEO Jon André Løkke commented last week.
Norwegian vessel operator Torghatten Nord has signed a contract with the Norwegian Public Roads Administration to operate hydrogen ferries between Bodø and Lofoten from 2025. Norghatten Nord will build two new hydrogen vessels and the existing main natural gas (LNG) vessels delivered in 2012 will be retrofitted to use low-emission solutions, the company wrote on Tuesday. Torghatten Nord argued that the hydrogen ferries will have ripple effects for Norway's hydrogen and maritime industries. The company sees significant opportunities for the shipyard and equipment industry.
Energy company Royal Dutch Shell has started operations at the power-to-hydrogen electrolyzer in Zhangjiakou, China, a joint venture between Shell (China) and Zhangjiakou City Transport Construction Investment Holding Group, the Anglo-Dutch company wrote on Friday. The electrolyzer will reportedly provide about half of the total green hydrogen supply for fuel cell vehicles at the Zhangjiakou competition zone during this year's Winter Olympic Games, set to begin on February 4. Shell looks set to make further investments in China’s hydrogen sector. “We see opportunities across the hydrogen supply chain in China, including its production, storage and shipping. We want to be the trusted partner for our customers from different sectors as we help them decarbonise in China,” commented Wael Sawan, director of Shell’s Integrated Gas, Renewable and Energy Solutions unit. The companies, which took 13 months to complete the project, have plans to scale the power-to-hydrogen electrolyzer up to 60 MW in the next two years. Utilizing onshore wind power, the project will initially supply green hydrogen to fuel a fleet of more than 600 fuel cell vehicles at the Zhangjiakou competition zone during the Winter Olympic Games. After that, the hydrogen will be used for public and commercial transport in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.
Green Hydrogen Systems, a provider of pressurized alkaline electrolyzers used in on-site hydrogen production based on renewable electricity, has signed a supply agreement with Edinburgh-based Logan Energy to deliver electrolysis equipment for a project in England. The order includes the supply of two electrolyzers with a combined capacity of 0.9 MW for the production of green hydrogen from renewable energy. “Manufactured by Green Hydrogen Systems and operated by Logan Energy, the electrolysers will be deployed in a 40 ft container as a complete green hydrogen plant as part of plans to develop a regional hydrogen economy in Dorset, England,” Green Hydrogen Systems wrote on Tuesday. When fully operational during Q4 of 2022, the ordered electrolyzers will reportedly have the capacity to provide approximately 389 kg green hydrogen per day.
Vertex Hydrogen, a new joint venture between Essar and Progressive Energy focused on hydrogen in North West England and North Wales, submitted plans to build the UK’s first low carbon hydrogen production hub as part of the government’s Cluster Sequencing process. “The hub, which will be built at the Stanlow Manufacturing Complex in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, includes technology that will capture carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to produce low carbon hydrogen. CO2 emissions will be stored offshore in Liverpool Bay,” wrote the company on Wednesday. The hydrogen produced by the HyNet low carbon cluster will replace fossil fuels in industry, heating homes, and fueling transport across the North West England and North Wales. Vertex’s hydrogen plant will begin production in 2026, reportedly generating over 1 GW of hydrogen. Waste fuel gases from Essar Stanlow, and natural gas, will be converted by Vertex Hydrogen into hydrogen, with carbon dioxide safely captured and stored by HyNet partner Eni, explained Vortex.
The Welsh government awarded funding to renewables installer and consultancy Dulas to look into the feasibility of hydrogen production in Wales using renewable energy sources. The four-month project, called HyFEAS, will include the examination of available technologies and assessment of the technical and commercial feasibility of hydrogen production.
German-based hydrogen technology company H-TEC will supply Westnetz with two 1 MW electrolysis systems for the CEC Haren GmbH & Co. KG project Green H2-Hub Haren in the town of Haren in Lower Saxony. The research and development project is intended to enable the establishment of a wind-powered decentralized hydrogen facility. The green hydrogen produced at the site will be stored in connection with specific regional applications, primarily for the mobility sector and in rural areas, primarily in the field of agriculture.
New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the introduction of House Bill 4, the Hydrogen Hub Development Act, which should expand the clean energy economy in New Mexico. The legislation will create tax incentives for low-carbon hydrogen production, distribution, use, refueling, and electric generating facilities across the state. The New Mexico Finance Authority will offer funding options to develop regional hydrogen hubs through the creation of public-private partnerships. New Mexico also wants to establish a greenhouse gas emission limit for any hydrogen-electric generating facility seeking tax incentives. “The public and private sectors are investing billions of dollars to deploy low-carbon hydrogen, with one report suggesting an estimated $300 billion in worldwide spending on hydrogen-related projects by 2030,” the office of the governor wrote on Tuesday. According to AP, state legislators have given the package a cold reception. “A state House panel voted 6-4 to indefinitely postpone consideration of a bill that would offer grants, loans and tax breaks to a nascent hydrogen industry,” wrote the news agency on Thursday.
Larsen & Toubro (L&T), an Indian multinational EPC contractor, has partnered with Norway’s HydrogenPro to set up a joint venture in India for gigawatt-scale manufacturing of alkaline water electrolyzers. The gigafab will serve the Indian market and also supply to other territories. With HydrogenPro's new electrode technology, it is possible to increase the efficiency of its alkaline high-pressure electrolysers by 14% to reach 93% of the theoretical maximum, the company stated.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/28/new-lithium-ion-battery-recycling-plant-in-norway/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,NORWAY,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 28, 2022",New lithium-ion battery recycling plant in Norway,"With demand for battery storage set to go nowhere but up in transitioning to a carbon-free economy, a fair number of sustainability concerns are being raised. Not the least of them is making batteries a truly circular and sustainable product.
Against the backdrop of the mounting challenge of lithium-ion battery recycling, Toronto-based Ly-Cycle has partnered with second-life battery specialist Eco Stor and battery manufacturer Morrow Batteries to build a new commercial lithium-ion battery recycling facility in southern Norway.
The facility will be capable of processing up to 10,000 tons of of lithium-ion batteries a year, including battery manufacturing scrap, full EV packs, and energy storage systems, with operations scheduled to start in early 2023. The parties are currently finalizing the site for the new recycling facility and awaiting regulatory approvals.
Oslo-headquartered Eco Stor, a portfolio company of Norwegian utility company Agder Energi, will provide the joint venture with end-of-life lithium-ion batteries, along with battery manufacturer Morrow Batteries supplying lithium-ion battery manufacturing scrap from its planned battery manufacturing facilities in Norway.
Based in southern Norway, Morrow Batteries is currently in the process of establishing its 43 GWh giga-factory that will utilize 100% renewable hydroelectric power. The factory is slated to be operational from Q4 2024.
As the majority owner of the joint venture, Li-Cycle will provide equipment, technology, technical services, and operational management for the new facility, while having the right to acquire 100% of the facility’s production of black mass — a dense, cakey mixture containing a blend of critical battery materials, including large amounts of lithium, manganese, cobalt, and nickel metals.
As one of the leaders in the adoption of electric vehicles, Norway is on track to phase out sales of new internal combustion engine vehicles as early as April on the back of its consistent and steep downward trend in sales of gas cars. “This would be three years ahead of the 2025 target proposed by the Norwegian government and could result in a significant, long-term supply of end-of-life batteries,” Li-Cycle said, adding it expects to be well-positioned to ultimately recycle and bring end-of-life batteries back into the lithium-ion battery supply chain.
But Li-Cycle is not alone in its ambitions. Another lithium-ion battery recycling plant broke ground in Fredrikstad, Norway, last year. The facility operated by Hydro Volt AS, a joint venture formed between Norwegian materials processing company Hydro and Sweden-headquartered lithium battery manufacturer Northvolt, will have capacity to process more than 8,000 tones of batteries per year, with the possibility to expand.
Spoke & Hub
Currently, the largest capacity lithium-ion battery recycling company in North America, Li-Cycle operates plants in Kingston, Ontario, and Rochester, New York. Last month, the company announced it will expand the capacity of its Rochester facility by about 40% due to the rising volume scrap in the U.S. The plant will have the capacity to process the equivalent to approximately 90,000 tons of lithium-ion battery feed annually.
Li-Cycle says its recycling processes are applicable to all chemistries and formats of lithium-ion batteries, capable of recovering 95% of all constituent materials and environmentally optimized with no production of landfill waste. Their proprietary Spoke & Hub Technologies use a combination of mechanical safe size reduction and hydrometallurgical resource recovery specifically designed for lithium-ion battery recycling.
In the Spoke phase, all types of lithium-ion batteries are transformed from a charged state to an inert product in a safe and efficient manner. What is left after the initial plastics and metals are separated out is black mass, which is the feed for Li-Cycle's Hub. There, cathode and anode materials are processed into battery grade end-products for reuse in lithium-ion battery production or other applications in the broader economy. The Norway facility will be Li-Cycle's first European Spoke, whereas its only Hub plant is located in Rochester.
In addition to three other Spoke facilities in the U.S. in construction or advanced development, the company is targeting its second Spoke in Europe to be in Germany. It is expected to have an annual processing capacity of 10,000 tones of lithium-ion battery input a year.

G1 products, measuring 158.75-223 mm, now cost RMB5.15 (US$0.81) per piece, up 4%, and 166 mm M6 wafers are 3.9% more expensive, at RMB5.35 (US$0.84). The price of M10, 182-247 mm wafers was raised 3.7% to RMB6.38 per piece (US$1.00). This upwards trend was confirmed by Taiwanese market research company PV Infolink, which reports price increases for all types of wafer products. One reason for the rise is increasing polysilicon demand, according to data released by the silicon branch of China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association.
Solar manufacturer JinkoSolar was listed on Wednesday on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) with the code 688223. The company issued a total of 2 billion shares at a price of RMB5 (US$0.79) per share through its IPO to raise RMB10 billion (US$1.57 billion). The capital market embraced Jinko, resulting in a 111% price increase in the first trading day, increasing the company value to over RMB100 billion (US$15.72 billion ).
Solar manufacturer Zhonghuan Semiconductor said it expects revenue of up to RMB43 billion (US$6.76 billion) for fiscal year 2021, with a YoY growth of 120%. Net profit attributable to shareholders is estimated to reach up to RMB4.2 billion (US$660 million), which would mean a growth of 286% over last year. The company said the strong performance depended on improved wafer sales, cost reductions and new capacities.
Embattled solar developer China Smarter Energy Group Holdings Ltd on Wednesday announced that the hearing of a winding up petition lodged against it by Danish conglomerate Nine United International Ltd has been adjourned by the High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region until March 23. C Smarter Energy told the Hong Kong Stock Exchange it is in negotiations with the petitioner to try and reach a settlement. The winding up petition relates to alleged non-payment by a C Smarter subsidiary and a connected business of loans of US$4.52 million and US$5.51 million signed in January and March 2020. Trading in C Smarter’s stock has been suspended since April 1.

The new provisions were included in a decree published today in the country's official journal.
The incentive cut will apply only for the period from February 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022, and will reduce the tariffs paid by the GSE to PV system operators depending on the zonal energy price, with the incentive reduction being proportional to the increase in energy prices.
The new rules apply only to existing installations under the Conto Energia program, which expired in 2014, and not those built under net metering program outside of the scheme.
“We express great concern for the new decree, as it establishes a forced levy on companies that produce energy from renewable sources without any possibility of compensation or restitution,” Italia Solare President Paolo Rocco Viscontini told pv magazine. “Although temporary, the decree represents a change in the rules of the electricity market and creates a loss of credibility in the country towards investors who today more than ever are called to make the energy transition by investing in new renewable plants.”
The new measure is also being opposed by several Italian trade bodies, including Italian wind power association Anev, hydropower association Assoidroelettrica, and enewables organization ANIE Rinnovabili, as well as consumer and environmental associations that were among the signatories of a letter to the government.
“The signatories believe that it is essential to quickly open a discussion table on a topic as important as that of the current energy crisis in our country, to define structural interventions that guarantee the country stable energy costs in the medium and long term, competitive and as independent as possible from international geopolitical contexts, in compliance with the decarbonization objectives assumed by our country,” the letter reads.

“This capacity matches with Russia’s first incentive program started in 2014 and that is set to end in 2024,” Anton Usachev, president of the Russian Solar Energy Association, told pv magazine. “Apart from grid-connected PV, off-grid solar installations totaling 17 MW were also deployed last year.”
Most of the deployed capacity comes from utility scale solar plants selected in the country's tender scheme for renewables. The latest tender round was held in September when the Russian authorities allocated 775 MW of solar power at an average price of RUB 5.18 ($0.067)/kWh.
“Commercial and industrial solar accounts for 4,5% of total PV generation, with all of this capacity coming from PPA agreements,” Usachev further explained. “Residential PV accounts for about 20 MW, of which 98% is off grid or hybrid with partial feeding into the grid.”
The Russian government recently approved a new tender scheme for renewables for the period 2025-2034, for which a total budget of RUB 147 billion ($1.88 billion) was allocated, Usachev added. “The solar capacity is not specified as it will hinge on bidding price on each auction held.”

Last summer, the German government coalition decided to increase the capacity of the solar tenders planned for 2022 from 1.9 to 6 GW and, shortly before Christmas, the European Commission approved this plan.
The Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) has now launched the first tender for ground-mounted solar plants with an output of between 750kW and 20MW. The deadline to submit bids is Mar. 1 and the offered capacity is 1,107.7MW instead of the originally planned 617MW. The ceiling price has been set at €0.0557 per kWh.
The Bundesnetzagentur also explained on its website that the total tendered capacity for ground-mounted installations will be 3.6GW, which is to be divided evenly over three tender rounds.

The Spanish companies Solartia and IED — experts in energy and electronics, respectively — have launched Arca, an autonomous solar power generator described as a robust and low-maintenance system that aims to alleviate energy poverty.
The system integrates solar panels, power electronics, energy storage and prepayment in a compact, robust and simple way, which allows it to be able to supply energy permanently anywhere in the world, according to the manufacturer. The solution is also designed to be installed in any location without qualified personnel.
Arca Lite has a rated installed power of 490 Wp, and Arca Plus of 980 Wp. The voltage range is 30-50 V and 60-100 V, respectively.
The system also features encapsulated electronics, which are claimed to allow the device to withstand up to 100% relative humidity, as well as  LiFePO4 batteries. A charge and discharge algorithm prevents overcharging and deep discharging of the system, offering between 3,000 and 6,000 cycles at 80% depth of discharge (DoD).
The system can assess the state of the battery in terms of the deterioration of its storage capacity and can thus carry out predictive maintenance, according to the manufacturers. Its passive cooling avoids the use of active elements such as fans, which shorten the lifetime of the system.
Arca can work at temperatures between -15 to 65 degrees Celsius. The manufacturers offer a 7-year warranty.
The system is also said to be able to model the usage patterns of users to know the energy needs of the network to which it is connected.
 
 
Solartia and IED also stated that the system requires very low maintenance and that no skilled labor is needed for its deployment.
“Arca is not only a generator with storage, but also an information system, as it is designed to communicate with the end-user and monitor human behavior, aspects that seem key to us in these non-interconnected areas,” said IED CEO Iñigo Ayerra.
Founded in 1999, Solartia specializes in solar energy, smart microgrid energy storage, and energy access. IED was established in the early 1990s in the town of Aizoáin, Navarra, with the aim of supplying the industry with electronic products tailored to the particular needs of each segment. Focused on the design, production and assembly of electronic equipment, as well as its marketing and post-sale, IED currently offers solutions for practically all industrial sectors: renewable energy, lifting, construction and electric mobility.

The method integrates techniques used for the automatic extraction of buildings along with their underlying roof faces, as well as the identification of utilizable rooftop areas for solar arrays. It is described as a three-step approach including automatic extraction of buildings footprint, automatic segmentation of roof faces, and automatic identification of utilizable areas.
“Specifically, the innovations of this work are a new method for roof face segmentation and a new method for the identification of utilizable rooftop areas,” the scientists stated, noting that the correctness and completeness for the first operation were found to be 95% and 85%, respectively. “The proposed methodology only requires digital surface models (DSMs) as input, and it is independent of other auxiliary spatial data to become more functional.”
The suitability of a roof for PV deployment is also evaluated by considering the area's solar radiation, with the modeling taking into account atmospheric effects, site elevation and orientation, daily and seasonal changes of the sun position, and the shadow effect of surrounding objects.
The roof faces suitable for PV installations are then captured by partitioning rooftops into planar segments. In this phase, the system utilizes geometric features including the height and greatest width of an above-ground object, and regional features, including the area of an object and the area of its constituent planar segments.
When these operations are carried out, the system is able to automatically identify the solar-suitable surfaces. “Having the spatial distribution of solar irradiation along with planar segments of roofs, utilizable rooftop areas can be automatically identified,” the academics explained. “Technical, geometric, and solar limitations are considered to accomplish this task.”
The methodology was tested in part of the Swedish city of Gothenburg, which the scientists describe as a city with buildings with complex roof forms. They found that around 27% of its roofs are suitable for PV installations. “The results also indicated that the proposed roof face segmentation method outperforms region growing, a widely used plane segmentation method,” they added.
The novel approach is proposed in the paper “Automatic identification of utilizable rooftop areas in digital surface models for photovoltaics potential assessment,” published in Applied Energy. The research group includes scientists from Sweden's University of Gävle and Uppsala University.

An example is Hevel Group, a manufacturer of solar modules and cells in Russia and Europe, which has developed a new BIPV product based on its high-tech heterojunction (HJT) solar modules.
Developed at its Research and Development Centre (R&D Centre), Hevel says the BIPV product is comprised of cells that have reached an efficiency of up to 24.2% which exceeds the efficiencies of standard monocrystalline and polycrystalline PV products.
Moreover, Hevel’s modules reportedly have a record low-temperature coefficient (-0.26%) and a minimum annual degradation (0.45%) per year. They also come with a guarantee for energy production up to 30 years.
BIPV systems have several advantages. For instance, they help to significantly reduce energy costs and shorten payback periods (five years and up). They also contribute to reduced CO2 emission levels, thus enabling companies to reach their environmental goals and meet the LEED, BREEAM, and GREEN ZOOM international standards.
There is an unlimited choice of options available on the RAL color chart and a multitude of textures to choose from.
Key to the Hevel Group is a personalized approach and maximum customer satisfaction. And it’s important to demonstrate modifications. Thus, it has a highly qualified team of experts to assist in finding the right BIPV module for the job.

U.S.-owned Scottish data company Wood Mackenzie also hinted the solar module price falls which have been tracked since the turn of the Western new year would continue. WoodMac said an anticipated 20% fall in the price of wind turbines would drive down overall renewables equipment prices in the nation by 8-10% in 2022. Polysilicon shortages and supply chain turmoil saw solar panel prices reverse their long-term cost reduction trend last year.
The analyst expects China to install 20% more clean power generation capacity this year than last and said more than half of the new power generation capacity anticipated out to 2025 would come from renewables.
With electric vehicle sales expected to hit 4.8 million this year, to best a national, 2025 target of 20% of total sales three years early, China may also tighten the carbon emission allowances distributed to thermal power generators under the emissions trading scheme launched last year, and could also expand the program to the building materials sector and non-ferrous metals.
On the other side of the energy ledger, WoodMac expects Beijing to continue efforts to ramp up domestic coal supplies, following the supply shock in the final three months of 2021 which led to power shortages, and research director Miaoru Huang said, in this morning's note: “China is unlikely to significantly reduce its import dependency on oil and gas” this year.

Rapid changes are underway for local solar and storage, as innovations drive down costs and create new markets for hardware and services, says Bill Nussey in the book Freeing Energy.
The former technology CEO and venture capitalist describes dozens of local energy opportunities, projecting that each represents a market of at least a billion dollars of annual revenue.
Nussey developed his thinking through interviews with hundreds of solar and storage industry participants. While many of the technologies he describes will be familiar to pv magazine readers, his public assessment that they represent billion-dollar opportunities is new.
Nussey says he wrote the book for the “ten thousand innovators needed” to speed the local energy transition. Even so, people already working in the industry are likely to find Nussey’s vision for the growth of local energy engaging, along with the “shop talk” throughout the book.
Nussey also presents a few innovation opportunities related to large-scale solar, arising from overbuilding of solar farms, or sizing them to power short winter days. Overbuilt solar farms will produce “cheap excess summer electricity” that will “spawn massive new industries” that operate each summer, Nussey says, such as desalination, indoor agriculture, or production of hydrogen and ammonia.
In a nod to policy, Nussey calls for “immediate attention” to slashing soft costs for local solar and storage installations—which helped Australia reach 20% residential solar uptake; instituting dynamic customer pricing to reduce electricity bills; and requiring new buildings to be ready for solar and storage installations.
Utilities in the future
Nussey says that an excess kilowatt-hour from rooftop solar is worth whatever a neighbor would otherwise pay the utility for a kilowatt-hour, “minus a small fee for transaction processing and using the grid for delivery.” Thus one of the billion-dollar opportunities Nussey foresees is transactive markets for electricity trading.
Continuing cost reductions, Nussey says, will make “local energy” the best way to provide most residential and commercial energy for the 70% of Americans who live in suburbs and rural areas.
Already cost reductions have led Hawaii to “embrace batteries” and “redefine the utility’s role as a backup provider,” Nussey says, calling Hawaii’s experience a “postcard from our future.”
In the long run, no matter how much utilities spend on lobbying, Nussey says, ultimately they will be unable to “withstand the pressure” from customers who will be “unwilling to pay two or three times more” for electricity than it costs to generate electricity themselves, or to buy electricity from a neighbor in a local market.
“The political winds will shift,” Nussey predicts, estimating that utilities have a 10-year window to “embrace local power” or else likely be “absorbed into more forward-thinking” utilities.
Stories
To support his views on electric utilities, Nussey presents examples of disruptive technologies displacing incumbents, such as ridesharing services outcompeting taxi monopolies. Throughout the book, he also recounts stories drawn from the history of technology, to help the reader grasp how the technology environment for local energy is changing.
Solar advocates may find a resource in the book’s arguments dispelling several “myths” raised by solar opponents. Nussey found only one “truth” in opponents’ claims, namely that solar power is intermittent. But that issue can be solved, he says, by reducing the cost of storage, overbuilding solar, tapping electric vehicle batteries using vehicle-to-grid technology, pairing solar with wind, and other measures.
Local solar provides 18 benefits, Nussey adds, including grid benefits. One benefit is a reduction of 1400 to 2100 pounds of carbon dioxide per month for a typical home’s rooftop solar system. If coal power is displaced, that rooftop system also prevents the creation of 185 pounds of coal ash per month.

ASX-listed multinational Rio Tinto is exploring its legal options after the Serbian government revoked the miner’s lithium exploration licences amid environmental concerns, hurting the company’s ambition to become Europe’s largest supplier of the critical mineral used in large-scale batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) and storing renewable energy.
Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabić said all decisions and licences regarding Rio Tinto’s Jadar lithium project had been annulled after requests by various environmental groups to halt the $3.3 billion project that was expected to start production in 2027.
Brnabić, who faces a general election in early April, told a news conference in Belgrade late last week the government had “fulfilled all the demands from the environmental protests and have put an end to Rio Tinto in the Republic of Serbia”.
“All decisions (linked to the lithium project) and all licences have been annulled,” she said.
“As far as the Jadar project and Rio Tinto are concerned, everything is over.”
Rio Tinto said in a statement it was “extremely concerned” by Serbia’s decision and was reviewing the legal basis for it, saying “it had always operated in compliance” with Serbian laws.
“Rio Tinto is reviewing the legal basis of this decision and the implications for our activities and our people in Serbia,” the company said.
Brnabić said the government was prepared to “fight against” any potential lawsuit from Rio Tinto linked to its cancellation of the project.
The decision shapes as a major setback for Rio Tinto, which was hoping the project would help make it one of the world’s 10 biggest producers of lithium, a key ingredient used in batteries for EVs and energy storage.
At full capacity, the Jadar mine was expected to produce approximately 58,000 tonnes of refined battery-grade lithium carbonate a year, making it Europe’s biggest lithium mine by output. Rio Tinto said the mine would have been capable of producing enough lithium to make about 1 million EV batteries a year to the highest environmental standards.
In addition, Jadar was expected to produce borates, which are used in solar panels and wind turbines.
The company said in a project fact sheet in July that it had already spent $450 million in pre-feasibility, feasibility and other studies on Jadar to understand the nature of the deposit.
The Jadar mine is Rio’s only lithium project although the company last month announced plans to buy a lithium asset in Argentina for $825 million, as it looks to build its battery materials business.
