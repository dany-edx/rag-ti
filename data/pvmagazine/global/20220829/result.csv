A groundbreaking ceremony was held recently for GAF Energy’s new 450,000-square foot manufacturing center in Georgetown, Texas. It will be GAF Energy’s second manufacturing facility in the United States, and reportedly the largest solar roofing manufacturing facility in the world. It is expected to bring hundreds of jobs to the Georgetown area.
“One of the reasons I was drawn to work at our parent company, Standard Industries, was their commitment to US-based jobs and manufacturing. We’re thrilled to be building the future of solar here in Georgetown, Texas. The community has welcomed us with open arms – and made the decision of where to build our second facility easy,” said Martin DeBono, the president of GAF Energy. “We’re producing our technologically cutting edge Timberline Solar roof here in the U.S. because we believe it allows us to make the best product for our customers.”
GAF Energy manufactures Timberline Solar, a nailable solar shingle that the company says is the only roof system to directly integrate solar technology into traditional roofing processes and materials. Construction expected to be completed by the summer of 2023, with full-operation by the end of 2023.
GAF Energy introduced Timberline Solar in January at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where it won three awards, including the “Best of Innovation Award” for Smart Cities. What sets the Timberline Solar roof apart from competing products (Tesla’s, for example) is that the roof system directly integrates solar technology into traditional roofing processes and materials.
Congressman John Carter, Georgetown Mayor Josh Schroeder, and other community leaders were on hand to celebrate the groundbreaking.
“Texas’ 31st district continues to grow because it’s a great place to live and work, and today we see more of that growth,” said Carter. “I’m proud that GAF Energy has chosen our great community to call home and create hundreds of new manufacturing jobs right here in Georgetown. GAF Energy is a shining example of the American spirit of innovation to meet the needs of today, while focusing on the future. I welcome them to my district and look forward to their continued success in their new home.”
Timberline Solar is currently manufactured at GAF Energy’s facility in San Jose, California, which was constructed last year, after the company moved manufacturing out of South Korea. At the time, the facility was expected to be able to produce 50 MW of solar panels per year, and provide jobs to about 400 people in manufacturing, engineering, and R&D.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/29/predicting-solar-power-output-with-limited-data-sizes/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,GREECE,PORTUGAL",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 29, 2022",Predicting solar power output with limited data sizes,"Scientists at the National Technical University of Athens have used a machine-learning method known as transfer- learning (TL) to develop a new solar power forecast modeling intended at helping developers with limited data size.
The TL method uses a trained model on one task to repurpose in a second, related task. The researchers used three TL strategies in combination with the stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) model, which is a kind of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. The LSTM technique takes the relevant parts of a pre-trained machine learning model and applies it to a new but similar problem.
“TL is exploited both for weight initialization of the LSTM model and for feature extraction, using different freezing approaches,” they explained. “LSTM depends on weight updating between the neurons of the deep learning model, allowing the creation of pre-trained models. Thus, it facilitates pre-training the model on the baseline PV in order to utilize the saved weights of the pre-trained model and apply TL on the target PV.”
The stacked LSTM model considers temperature, humidity, solar irradiance, PV production, one-hot encoding representation of the month of the year, and sine/cosine transformation of the hour of day. The three strategies were based on three different approaches: keeping the weights of the layer fixed, fine-tuning the weights of the layer based on the target domain data, and training the weights of the layer from scratch based on the target domain data.
The “TL Strategy 1” approach is reportedly able to extract features from the source domain and carry them to the target domain.
“This is a widely used scheme when treating images, where the first layers are used as feature extraction layers and the last layers are used to adapt to new data,” the researchers explained.
With “TL Strategy 2,” weights of all layers of the TL model are initialized based on data from the source domain. They are fine-tuned based on data from the target domain.
“This approach is extensively used with problems where there is an abundance of data in the source domain, but a scarcity of data in the target domain,” the group said.
In “TL Strategy 3,” the initial layers of the TL model are frozen and the last layer is trained from scratch, popping the last layer of the base model and adding a new layer after the frozen layers.
“This approach is similar to the first one, but it differs in the fact that the weights of the last layer are not initialized based on data from the source domain,” the academics said.
The researchers used the three strategies to forecasting the hourly production of six solar plants located across several locations in Portugal. Their effectiveness was compared to that of conventional non-TL models.
“The findings of the experimental application indicate that all three TL strategies significantly outperform the non-TL approach in terms of forecasting accuracy, evaluated by several error indexes,” the scientists said. “Results indicate that TL models significantly outperform the conventional one, achieving 12.6% accuracy improvement in terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE) and 16.3% in terms of forecast skill index with one year of training data.”
They introduced the model in “Transfer learning strategies for solar power forecasting under data scarcity,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports.
“This study is the first step towards enhancing our understanding of the impact of TL on solar plant power prediction,” they concluded. “Future work will concentrate on assessing the impact of the base model’s training data volume, investigating whether training base models with more data or with data from different solar plants could further improve forecasting accuracy.”

“The order for E.ON Denmark consists of turnkey contract for a heat pump with associated exchanger, piping and purification system, which will be extracting the energy from the treated wastewater before it is subsequently discharged into the local environment at Roskilde Fjord,” Aalborg CSP said in a statement. “The heat pump itself, which applies the natural refrigerant ammonia (to be completely renewable and nontoxic), will have a maximum output of approx. 2,500 kW.”
The Danish renewable energy company said the heat pump will be set up at a local wastewater treatment plant. It claimed that it will have a high coefficient of performance (COP), with the wastewater temperature varying throughout the year.
“On the one hand, it is positive for the aquatic environment that the outlet temperature of the treated wastewater is decreased and is hence closer to the temperature of the aquatic environment in which it is discharged,” it explained. “Likewise, it is positive for district heating consumers, as the relatively high temperature of wastewater ensures a more stable and sustainable energy supply.”
The ammonia heat pump is equipped with two stage compressors, with a life cycle of 25 years.
“The solution is furthermore designed flexibly in a manner which allows for changes in the heat source, thereby giving certainty to the bankability of the long-term investment. A possible switch of heat source can allow the plant to utilize the outdoor air as an energy source if the treatment plant were to be closed down in connection with potential future changes in the wastewater plan,” the company said.
Aalborg CSP also develops thermal energy storage, CSP projects, integrated energy systems, and solar district heating.

The Japanese industrial group said the new inverter can maintain the grid frequency of distribution systems by providing pseudo-inertia through power output from the inverter when the grid frequency rapidly fluctuates.
“Toshiba has implemented a control algorithm of the grid-forming inverter in battery energy storage systems instead of conventional control algorithm without inertia, and when there are rapid fluctuations in renewable energy output or power demands, the inverter outputs power and generates a synthetic inertia to maintain the grid frequency,” the company said in a statement. “This instantly suppresses sudden drops in frequency, realizing a stable power supply.”
Toshiba tested the inverter in a simulated microgrid with a grid frequency of 50 Hz, a 40% renewable energy rate, and five 20 kW/14.9 kWh batteries. The system also featured a diesel synchronous generator with a capacity of 125 kVA, and two load banks to vary the power load.
“It was demonstrated that under load fluctuations of 50 kW, grid frequency reductions were suppressed by 70%, from 2.4 Hz (50.0 to 47.6 Hz) to 0.6 Hz (50.0 Hz to 49.4 Hz),” the company said, in reference to the test results. “The frequency threshold for power supply interruptions due to grid frequency fluctuations in East Japan is set at 48.5 Hz, and verifications using actual equipment ensured that the frequency did not fall below this threshold, demonstrating the realization of a stable power supply that avoids power outages.”
The company conducted a second test on a 20 kW PV system without batteries, and found that the grid frequency was suppressed by approximately 30%, from 1 Hz (50.0 to 49.0 Hz) to 0.7 Hz (50.0 to 49.3 Hz).
“Toshiba also verified that instantaneous load on the GFM inverter can be reduced by 30%, from 22 to 16 kW, by selecting an inertia suitable for parallel operation of synchronous generators with internal combustion engines, like those expected to be used in a microgrid,” it said.
The company said it plans to reveal the results at the Annual Conference of the Power and Energy Society of the Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan in September. It will also discuss its findings at the 2022 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE2022) in October.

After 64 days of continuous flight, a solar-powered drone-satellite developed by Airbus Defense and Space crashed in the desert in the US state of Arizona on Aug. 18. The incident did not cause any injuries.
“The prototype aircraft's flight ended when the Zephyr 8 UAS encountered events that led to its unexpected shutdown,” said the US Army Command in a statement.
The drone was launched from the Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) test site in Arizona on June 15. The unmanned aircraft soared more than 60,000 feet (about 18 km) over the southern United States, the Gulf of Mexico, and South America, before returning to its starting point. Prior to the crash, air traffic control data showed the drone flying at an unusually low altitude.
“The military and its partners have collected invaluable data and increased knowledge about the endurance, battery efficiency, and station-keeping capabilities of the aircraft at high altitudes,” said said Michael Monteleone, director of the military program overseeing the flight. “This knowledge will allow us to continue to advance the requirements for reliable and modernized stratospheric capabilities for our soldiers.”
The drone, which is remotely controlled by satellite, weighs 75 kg. It has a wingspan of 25 meters and is entirely covered with PV modules with multi-junction cells. The system enabled the aircraft to travel more than 55,000 km, or more than one trip around the Earth.
The Zephyr 8 drone managed to double the previous endurance record for an unmanned aircraft, which was just under 26 days. Within a few hours, it would have been able to break the record for the longest flight in history, held by two American airmen, at 64 days, 22 hours, 19 minutes and five seconds in the sky.
Unmanned aircraft are drawing interest from the military and telecoms sectors. They can be used for high-resolution observation, surveillance, and high-speed communication services.

The government of New South Wales, Australia, said the Illawarra Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) south of Sydney has attracted AUD 43 billion ($29.4 billion) of potential investments in response to a call for expressions of interest for large-scale energy projects.
New South Wales Treasurer and Energy Minister Matt Kean said the state has received commercial interest to develop 44 projects, including wind, solar, energy storage, pumped hydro and green hydrogen production totaling 17 GW of capacity.
“The response has been tremendous, with particularly strong interest in offshore wind, energy storage technologies and green hydrogen,” Kean said. “The Illawarra REZ will help deliver cheap and reliable energy, power existing industries, support emerging industries to thrive and create thousands of new jobs in the future.”
The proposals include five large-scale solar projects, 16 energy storage projects, and four pumped-hydro projects. Investors have also proposed two onshore wind energy projects and eight offshore installations, as well as three new “load projects,” including green steel manufacturing.
“This highlights the variety of large-scale energy projects being developed in the region, that will ensure the Illawarra plays a role as the powerhouse of the renewable energy economy,” Kean said.
The Illawarra REZ is one of five renewable energy zones included in the New South Wales government’s electricity roadmap. The state aims to support more than AUD 32 billion of private investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission.
The Energy Corporation of NSW (EnergyCo), a state-run authority behind the REZs, said it will now work closely with industry, local government, local communities and other stakeholders. The Illawarra REZ is expected to be formally declared under the New South Wales government’s electricity roadmap legislation by the end of 2022. REZs are also being developed in other parts of the state. They are expected to bring at least 12 GW of renewable energy and 2 GW of storage online.

Toronto-based Hydrostor has revealed that it has selected Kiewit Engineering Group to advance front-end engineering and design studies for the 500 MW/4 GWh Willow Rock Energy Storage Center. Once completed, the site will be the largest standalone energy storage project in California.
The installation will feature Hydrostor’s Advanced Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES) technology. The company said its equipment can provide affordable, emissions-free long-duration energy storage (LDES). The project will store enough energy to provide power to 400,000 homes over eight-hour durations, storing intermittent wind and solar energy.
Hydrostor’s technology features a four-step process to store and dispatch energy. It initially pulls off-peak or surplus energy from the grid, producing heated compressed air. Then, the heat is extracted from the air stream, and stored inside a thermal store, preserving the energy for later use.
The compressed air is then stored in a tank that via the hydrostatic compensation process to maintain constant pressure during operation.  When the energy needs to be dispatched, pressure forces air to the surface, where it is then recombined with heat, and sent through a turbine, producing dispatchable electricity.
“Hydrostor continues to reach important milestones at Willow Rock, and we look forward to working with the world-class engineering and construction teams at Kiewit to advance this critical clean energy project. Our global teams are paving the way towards achieving aggressive net-zero goals.” said Curtis VanWalleghem, Hydrostor’s chief executive officer. “Willow Rock will be capable of eliminating the equivalent of roughly 120,000 cars off the road every year.”
In January, Hydrostor announced a preferred equity financing commitment of $250 million from Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Goldman Sachs will fund its investment in tranches tied to project milestones to match Hydrostor’s capital needs and accelerate project execution. The funds will also support the company’s global development and marketing initiatives, including the expansion of its project pipeline.
“The need for utility-scale long-duration energy storage is clear,” said Charlie Gailliot, partner at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “Hydrostor’s A-CAES solution is well positioned to become a leading player in this emerging global market.”
In June 2021, the California Energy Commission said that it would procure 1,000 MW of long-duration energy storage, with durations of eight hours or longer, to be activated during the 2026-28 period.

Ambri, a developer of liquid-metal long-duration energy storage systems, has revealed plans to partner with Colorado electric utility Xcel Energy on a demonstration project. The project will demonstrate the ability of Ambri’s calcium-antimony liquid metal batteries to interact with renewable energy.
MRI Global’s Solar Technology Acceleration Center (SolarTAC) will be the host site for the demonstration project. The SolarTAC was established to test renewable energy technologies in real-world, grid-connected environments.
Ambri’s chemistry is being developed to meet the demands of large industrial energy customers, such as data centers. The company’s large-scale battery unit has 250 kW/1,000 kWh of capacity, DC efficiency of more than 80% under a wide set of use cases, a response time of less than 500 milliseconds, and voltages between 550 V to 1,150 V.
It is housed in a 10-foot shipping container. The system holds shelves of cells, thermal management systems, a weatherproof outer enclosure, and a battery management system for applications that require high energy capacity, frequent cycling, long lifetimes, and high efficiency.
Xcel Energy is the first utility in the United States to set a long-term goal of providing its customers with zero-carbon electricity. It aims to be net-zero across electricity, heating, and transportation by 2050. Ambri’s technology is designed to perform in a wide range of environments, potentially making it the right fit for Xcel to effectively store and dispatch power in harsh Colorado weather conditions.
The SolarTAC has been owned and operated by MRI Global since 2011. It will test Ambri’s technology for one year. In addition to solar and energy storage, the site is used to test microgrid capabilities at the edge of the electric distribution system.
In 2020, Ambri signed a deal with TerraScale, a clean infrastructure development company, to deliver 250 MWh of Ambri systems to TerraScale’s Energos Reno data center project. The site’s battery will be bolstered by a reported 500 MW of on-site renewable generation.
