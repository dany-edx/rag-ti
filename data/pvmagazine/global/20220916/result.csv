The 8.75 MW PEM electrolysis plant will use only solar and wind power. Siemens did not disclose where the green electricity would come from. The plant's operator is the specially founded company WUN H2, in which Siemens Financial Services and the company Rießner Gase from nearby Lichtenfels each have a 45% stake and the Wunsiedel municipal utility a 10% share. WUN H2 is currently considering expanding the plant to 17.5 MW. The facility can generate up to 1,350 tons of green hydrogen annually. “The Wunsiedel concept demonstrates that local green hydrogen production is feasible in Germany. Waste heat recovery and regional hydrogen use for industrial purposes, transportation and energy storage boost the business case,” Thomas Hillig, managing director at THEnergy consultancy in Munich, told pv magazine. 
Engie has taken the Final Investment Decision for an industrial-scale renewable hydrogen project in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The project will include a 10 MW electrolyzer powered by 18 MW solar PV and supported by an 8 MW battery energy storage system. “Scheduled for completion in 2024, the first phase of the Yuri project will produce up to 640 tonnes of renewable hydrogen per year as a zero carbon feedstock for Yara Australia's ammonia production facility in Karratha,” wrote the French energy company. Mitsui has agreed to acquire a 28% stake in the joint venture company for the Yuri project, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions under the agreement. Australian authorities are supporting the project with two grants for a total of AUD 49.5 million ($ 33.2 million).
The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis wrote that the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is in a prime position to start producing carbon-neutral or green steel. “The MENA region can lead the world if it shifts promptly to renewables and applies green hydrogen in its steel sector,” said Soroush Basirat, author of the “Green Steel Opportunity in the Middle East and North Africa” report. The analysis underlines that the region's sector is dominated by direct reduced iron-electric arc furnace (DRI-EAF) technology, which releases lower emissions than the obsolete coal-fuelled blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) process used in 71% of global crude steel production in 2021. “In 2021, MENA produced just 3% of global crude steel but accounted for nearly 46% of the world's DRI production,” said Basirat. The DRI-EAF process uses electricity and syngas from natural gas or gasified coal. It could be zero emissions if green hydrogen (produced using renewable energy-powered electrolysis) and electric arc furnaces powered by renewable energy were used. The region would not require investments in base technology, with all the funds used to expand the production of green hydrogen. DRI-EAF production should reach between 29% and 56% of primary steel production, according to different estimates. The World Bank said that MENA has the highest global photovoltaic power potential and could theoretically produce more than 5.8 kWh per square meter daily. It is predicted that 83 GW of wind and 334 GW of solar power will be added by 2050, increasing the share of wind and solar from 1% and 2%, respectively, to 9% and 24%. “With MENA's available capacity, producing green hydrogen below $1/kg is achievable by 2050,” said Basirat, speaking about Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) found that governments committed $126 billion to hydrogen by August 2022. The US committed at least $13 billion for clean H2 producers under its Inflation Reduction Act, while the European Union's REPowerEU plan introduced the long-awaited carbon contract for difference system. “These policies will make clean hydrogen more competitive, helping producers find buyers to build the clean H2 supply capacity,” BNEF wrote. Production of clean H2 could reach 44.3 million metric tons based on announced projects, equivalent to 38% of gray H2 production today. “While many electrolysis projects are delayed, we expect 247 GW of electrolyzers installed by 2030. Blue hydrogen also plays a strong role in the US, Canada, and UK thanks to support for carbon capture and storage,” BNEF wrote. BNEF's database counts 146 industrial projects planning to use clean H2, up from 114 in January.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced plans to create the European Hydrogen Bank, a new financial institution able to invest €3 billion to help build the future market for hydrogen. Meanwhile, the European Parliament adopted a measure to raise the share of renewables in the EU's final energy consumption, scrapping the “additionality” requirements at the EU level within the Renewable Energy Directive II (RED II). The Parliament will now start negotiations with the Council. 
H2 MOBILITY Germany plans to purchase green hydrogen from Hy2B Wasserstoff starting in 2024. The green hydrogen will supply H2 MOBILITY hydrogen stations, primarily in Bavaria. Hy2B's hydrogen production plant in Pfeffenhausen is part of the HyPerformer model region HyBayern, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Digital Affairs and Transport (BMDV). Starting in the second half of 2023, the hydrogen electrolysis plant will produce green hydrogen using renewable electricity from a newly constructed open-space photovoltaic plant and later also from wind turbines in the immediate vicinity.

Anyone operating a photovoltaic system with an output of up to 30 KW on a single-family home or commercial property will no longer have to pay income tax on the electricity yield from the beginning of 2023.
The German government approved the measure in its Annual Tax Act 2022. This tax exemption also applies to multi-family houses and mixed-use properties owning a PV system with an output of 15 kW.
In addition, the value-added tax (VAT) will no longer be due on the purchase, import, and installation of photovoltaic systems and energy storage systems. The prerequisite for this is that the systems are installed on or near private homes and apartments as well as on public and other buildings that are used for activities serving the common good.
This VAT exemption means that operators will no longer have to deal with the so-called “Regulation for Small Business Entrepreneurs” in order to receive reimbursement, thus being relieved from bureaucracy. In approving the regulation, the federal government is also using leeway offered by the new EU VAT Directive.
In addition, the federal cabinet has decided that income tax assistance associations may in the future also advise their members on income tax if they operate photovoltaic systems with an output of up to 30 kW that are subject to the income tax exemption. Fiscal legislation had previously prohibited this.

Brazil's Electric Power Chamber of Commerce (CCEE) announced this week that the A-5 energy auction scheduled for September 16 has been suspended and that it is now investigating the causes and effects of the event.
A new schedule of auction activities is to be published soon. Through the procurement exercise, the Brazilian authorities will select power projects that will have to begin generating power from January 2027.
A total of 1,345 solar projects had registered to participate in the A-5 auction, with a capacity of 55,822 MW, 67.2% of the total registered for the auction, 83,005 MW, which included five other generation sources. The ceiling price for the exercise was set at BRL 280 ($53.3)/MWh
The state of Minas Gerais has the largest share in photovoltaic project proposals for the auction, with 328 bids totaling 14,268 MW. It was followed by Rio Grande do Norte, with 6,158 MW (142 solar projects); Bahia, 9,900 MW (250 projects); Piauí, 7,881 MW (208 projects); and Ceará, 5,621 (150 projects).
In the last auction in which solar projects participated, the A-4 held in May, an average of 39.8 MW was sold at an average price of BRL 178/MWh ($34.74/MWh), with the maximum at BRL 225/MWh ($43.91/MWh).
In August, the Ministry of Mines and Energy canceled the A-6 auction, which would have contracted energy from 2028, citing a lack of demand from energy distributors. It would have have been held jointly with the A-5 auction. Prior to the announcement, Absolar had filed a lawsuit requesting the participation of solar projects in the A-6, which was not planned.

French Minister of Ecological and Solidarity Transition Agnès Pannier-Runacher has announced measures to support collective and individual self-consumption.
“Our objective is to ensure that the prefects work on renewable energy sources,” Pannier-Runacher said on Tuesday at a meeting of the country's Economic Affairs Committee. The minister specified, however, that this should be discussed within the framework of the energy-climate law, which has been announced for the second quarter of 2023.
“We had thought of doing an ecological planning component on the energy-climate law on the acceleration of renewable energy sources. The difficulty is that we are simultaneously engaging in an energy-climate debate that is supposed to animate all local communities,” Pannier-Runacher said. “There is a risk of making a first law and coming back to it six months later. The debate will have to pass through the parliament, taking into account the nature of the texts and the measures to be taken.”
With regard to self-consumption, the minister announced support measures, approved by the country's Higher Energy Council on September 8. These are rebates to facilitate the upfront investment, taking inflation into account in the prices for the sale of power to the grid, and facilitating the collective self-consumption for energy communities.

According to the current legislation, the EU is obliged to cover at least 32% of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2030. With the 45% target, the MEPs go beyond the 40% mark decided by the member states in June. The next step is negotiations on the renewables target with the member states.
With 418 favorable votes, 109 unfavorable votes and 111 abstentions, the result was very clear. The conservative EPP, the social democratic S&D, the liberal Renew Europe, and a large part of the Green MPs voted for the new target. The Greens, together with the Left, had previously tried unsuccessfully to win majorities for a target of 55% to 56%.
The parliamentary decision also sets sub-targets for sectors such as transport, buildings and district heating and cooling. In the transport sector, for example, the use of renewable energy should lead to a 16% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions – through a higher proportion of advanced biofuels and a more ambitious quota for renewable fuels of non-biogenic origin, such as hydrogen. Industry is expected to increase its use of renewable energy by 1.9 percentage points per year, and operators of district heating networks by 2.3 points.
In addition, each member state should develop two cross-border projects for the expansion of renewables. Member states with annual electricity consumption of more than 100 TWh are called to develop a third project by 2030.
“Only the development of renewable energy means real independence,” said Markus Pieper, German EPP member and rapporteur for the Renewable Energy Directive. “We strongly support the increased target of 45% for 2030. We reiterate the need for greater cross-border cooperation to expand renewable energy deployment and call for a diversified hydrogen import strategy.”

According to an official statement released by the agency, 2,267 cases of illegal fund management were identified across 12 local governments over the entire 5-year period of the previous government. The cases relate mostly to illegal loan execution, unlawful subsidy allocation, and bid rigging. “All illegal cases discovered will be further investigated and illegally allocated subsidies will be refunded,” the OGPC said, noting that the investigation is only a sample investigation limited to a specific region, and that it will be soon extended to the rest of the country.
Some of the cases also relate to the deployment of solar parks on agricultural land hosting mushroom or insect breeding facilities, which can be built without converting farmland to other uses. “Although these projects were presented as including a mushroom cultivation facility or insect breeding facility, in reality, there were no traces of properly growing mushrooms or insects there,” the agency said.
The OGPC said the Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) will participate in the nationwide investigation.
South Korea is currently supporting large-scale solar and renewables through a tendering scheme. These tenders were launched in 2018 and through them the authorities have allocated so far around 8.85 GW of solar power.

A new Canadian Solar battery product will be unveiled at the RE+ conference in Anaheim, California, a large event that will bring together leaders in renewable energy and clean technologies from Sept. 19-22.
The battery is a utility-scale lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) battery with a 2.8 MWh energy capacity. LFP chemistry is hailed for cutting the risk of thermal runway, or fires, that can be problematic in other lithium-based battery systems.
Called the SolBank, the system is designed for safety, reliability, and bankability. The battery enclosure contains liquid cooling mechanisms and humidity control, and active balancing battery management systems. The company said the technology complies with the latest international safety standards.
Canadian Solar’s majority owned subsidiary CSI Energy Storage produces the unit in Jiangsu Province, China. The current annual battery manufacturing output capacity is 2.5 GWh and is expected to reach 10 GWh by the end of 2023.
The SolBank product will be displayed at Canadian Solar’s booth #2204, Anaheim Convention Center, Halls A-D.
CSI Energy Storage also provides full commissioning and integration services, turnkey engineering, procurement, and construction project execution and long-term operational service and capacity maintenance. As of Q2 2022, the company’s system integration total pipeline reached 11 GWh, including 861 MWh under long-term service agreements, 1.9 GWh under construction or contracted and an additional earlier stage pipeline of 8.2 GWh.
“Our manufacturing capacity in battery storage will spur the continued growth of our battery storage solutions business, which will in turn enhance the synergies with our battery storage project development business,” said Dr. Shawn Qu, chair and CEO of Canadian Solar. “Solar plus battery storage will be one of the key solutions to combat climate change.”
Residential battery
Additionally, Canadian Solar recently announced an all-in-one residential battery and hybrid inverter, called the EP Cube, also to be displayed at RE+.
One unit can scale from 9.9 kWh to 19.9 kWh in capacity, and up to six units can be connected in parallel, achieving 119.9 kWh of storage and 45.6 kW output, said the company. This is more than enough to fully power the average home with high-surge-current appliances and AC units.
EP Cube is designed to be lightweight and easy to install, featuring all-inclusive components and self-configuration for fast commissioning. Each battery module weighs less than 70 lbs., significantly lower than many residential units, which can weigh upwards of 300 lbs. The battery module measures only 6.25 inches thick and is NEMA 4X rated for both indoor and outdoor use.
The battery is compatible with the EP Cube app, which allows homeowners to monitor production and consumption in real time. Homeowners have access to their energy management through the app, and installers use the app to set up and troubleshoot the system. Updates are made remotely to the battery management system.
Over the past two decades, Canadian Solar has delivered over 76 GW of solar modules to customers across the world. Since entering the project development business in 2010, the company has developed, built and connected over 6.8 GW in over 20 countries across the world. Currently, the company has about 311 MW of solar projects in operation, 5.3 GW of projects under construction or in backlog (late-stage), and an additional 21 GW of projects in pipeline (mid- to early-stage).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/16/energy-vault-to-deploy-2-gwh-of-gravity-storage-in-china/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CHINA,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2022",Energy Vault to deploy 2 GWh of gravity storage in China,"Switzerland-based gravity storage system provider Energy Vault announced it will build five storage projects with a combined storage capacity of 2 GWh in China.
The company said the projects will rely on its EVx gravity-based energy storage technology and that it will partner with US-based Atlas Renewable Energy, Chinese NGO EIPC, China-based telecommunications company China Tianying, and unspecified selected provincial and local governments for their construction.
“In February 2022, Energy Vault and Atlas Renewable signed a licensing and royalty agreement for the deployment of Energy Vault’s gravity energy storage technology in China which followed a $50 million equity investment into the company as part of the IPO earlier this year on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),” the company said in a statement. “The companies immediately commenced the construction of a first 25 megawatt (MW), 100 MWh system outside Shanghai in the distric of Pudong, which broke ground in March 2022 earlier this year.”
In April, Energy Vault signed an agreement with Indian utility NTPC Ltd aimed at forging a long-term strategic partnership. NTPC will deploy Energy Vault’s EVx gravity-based energy storage technology and software solutions based on the outcome of a joint feasibility study.
In January, Korea Zinc agreed to invest $50 million in Energy Vault so it can use its energy storage technology at its Australian refinery. The South Korean smelting giant is the latest major company to back Energy Vault ahead of its listing on the New York Stock Exchange.
The new investment upsized previously announced private investment in public equity funding from $100 million to $150 million, in conjunction with Energy Vault’s agreement to become a publicly traded company through a merger with Novus Capital Corporation II. Its previous funding round included investments from Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures, BHP Ventures, Volta Energy Technologies, and Softbank Vision Fund, among others.
Energy Vault’s EVx storage system is comparable to pumped hydro, using grid-scale renewable energy when supply is abundant to drive motors and raise 30-ton blocks on a six-arm crane tower, rather than water, up to a height. When power needs to be discharged back to the grid, the blocks are lowered, harvesting the kinetic energy.
According to the company, there is zero degradation in the storage capacity of the composite blocks, which can remain in the raised position for unlimited periods of time. Its composite blocks are developed in cooperation with Mexico’s Cemex, using local soil at sites where it builds its storage systems, as well as other materials such as recycled coal ash, waste tailings from mining operations, and decommissioned wind turbine blades.
Energy Vault’s EVx tower features 80% to 85% round-trip efficiency and over 35 years of technical life. It has a scalable modular design up to multiple gigawatt-hours in storage capacity.

The scientists used an optimized post-hydrogen plasma treatment (HPT) to enhance the surface passivation qualities of the (i)a-Si:H layers, which were deposited through a multi-chamber plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) tool under various temperatures between 140 C and 200 C.
They also applied a very-high-frequency (VHF) treatment to improve the quality of the passivation process. “The VHF treatment consists of highly H-diluted SiH4 plasma, which mainly modifies the microstructure of (i)a-Si:H layers rather than depositing (i)nc-Si:H, as no change in the thickness of (i)a-Si:H was detected via spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) after 6 min of this VHF treatment,” they explained.

The research group utilized Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to measure the microstructural evolution of (i)a-Si:H layers under various conditions. “Interestingly, porous films deposited under lower temperatures exhibited significantly improved and better passivation qualities with additionally applied HPTs, which favor the formation of porous and H-rich film,” it stated. “Besides, we also noticed distinctive peaks around Si-H W-RM in the infrared spectra, which seemingly reveal microstructural properties of thin-film (i)a-Si:H layers that are still unclear, for which further investigations on the vibrational origins of those peaks are still required.”
The solar cell built with this manufacturing technique at 160 C achieved an in-house-certified power conversion efficiency of 24.18%, an open-circuit voltage of 726.0 mV, a short-circuit current of 39.97 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 83.3%. This cell features further improved thickness combinations of the p-layer. A similar cell built at 160 C without the improvement of the p-layer achieved an efficiency of 23.71%, an open-circuit voltage of 724.5 mV, a short-circuit current of 39.81 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 82.2%
“As the deposition temperature of (i)a-Si:H and associated material properties affect solar cell performance, we showed that high performance devices should meet critical requirements in optimizing the (i)a-Si:H that are not only limited to an excellent surface passivation quality to reduce losses induced by interface recombination,” the academics explained.
They presented the cell in the paper “Effects of (i)a-Si:H deposition temperature on high-efficiency silicon heterojunction solar cells,” published in Progress in Photovoltaics. “We demonstrate that carefully optimizing (i)a-Si:H layers that fulfill both requirements can contribute to higher SHJ solar cell efficiencies,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/16/novel-tech-to-recycle-silver-aluminum-from-end-of-life-solar-panels/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2022","Novel tech to recycle silver, aluminum from end-of-life solar panels","Scientists from the University of Leicester in the UK have discovered a process to recover silver and aluminum from used PV cells that is cheaper and more environmentally friendly than current recycling processes using mineral acids.
The researchers used the technology on crystalline solar cells measuring 12 × 15 cm, weighing 2 g, and consisting of a 100 µm thick silicon wafer, coated with a 100 nm thick silicon nitride anti-reflective layer on the front side and a 20 µm thick layer of aluminum on the back side, both stripped with silver electrodes approximately 30 μm high.
“First, we place the solar cell in an aluminum chloride solution. The aluminum electrode is removed from the silicon wafer. We use ultrasound to promote the dissolution of the aluminum, which takes place within a few minutes,” researcher Guillaume Zante told pv magazine.
Given the low cost of aluminum, there may be no economic interest in recovering it, but the aluminum salt solution could be used for wastewater treatment purposes, according to the scientists. “In the second step, the silver is dissolved from the solar cell using iron chloride, an oxidizing agent, in a choline chloride or calcium chloride brine, which takes around 10 minutes,” Zante explained, noting that the components of these two brines, or salt water, are found in chicken feed and grit used on roads to avoid ice, respectively, and are thus widely available, cheap, and low on toxicity.
“It is interesting to note that iron dissolved in water cannot oxidize silver, but iron dissolved in the brine can. Using a brine instead of water improves the ability of iron to oxidize silver and improves the solubility of silver in the brine,” Zante said. “This is due to the presence of chloride ions in the brine. The addition of water to the brine dilutes the chloride ions, allowing the silver chloride to precipitate. Silver chloride is easily filtered from the solution.”
This process successfully recovers silver chloride with a purity of 98%, which according to the researchers could be converted into metallic silver in a further step, thereby increasing its purity. The process does not affect the silicon wafer and nitride anti-reflective coating, leaving open the possibility to reuse the silicon in PV panels or processing it for other uses.
The results were obtained in a lab setting, using a few grams of solar cells, and may differ at an industrial scale. However, the authors believe that industrialization is feasible due to their use of cheap, low-toxicity and readily available chemicals. “Since we are using cheap chemicals, the price could be as low as the processing costs with mineral acids and in some cases cheaper, around $0.4 lower per kilogram of solar cell as compared to mineral acids,” Zante affirmed.
They presented their findings in “Efficient recycling of metals from solar cells using catalytic etchants,” which was recently published in the Journal of Cleaner Production. The scientists are currently developing a strategy to scale up the technology and to extract other metals from waste sources, including bismuth, tellurium and copper from thermoelectric materials, which are used in perovskite, thin film, and wiring and cabling in solar cells, respectively. They are also attempting to extract gold, nickel and copper from printed circuit-boards, as well as neodymium and dysprosium from waste magnets. The academics are part of the Met4Tech project, which supports the creation of a circular economy for technology metals.

Transgrid has confirmed its Victoria-New South Wales Interconnector (VNI) upgrade project, which will increase transfer capacity into NSW from Victoria by 170 MW at times of high demand, is now more than 80% complete with the network operator saying it remains on track for completion this year.
The project, identified as a priority by both the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and the NSW government, involves an upgrade of Transgrid’s substations at Yass and Stockdill in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) using SmartValve technology designed by US-based company Smart Wires. Smart Wires’ modular power flow controller technology enables the real-time control of electricity flows along power lines. The SmartValve system detects areas of congestion in the network and automatically redirects flows to less congested lines.
Transgrid executive manager of works delivery Craig Stallan said the system will increase the capacity for the efficient flow of energy across state lines, unlocking spare transmission capacity using existing transmission infrastructure.
“This is clever technology which benefits both customers and the environment and will allow renewable energy from Victoria to flow into NSW and the ACT when demand is greatest,” he said.“We are maximizing the capacity of the existing infrastructure, resulting in a more secure, stable network that will be able to integrate more renewable energy.”
The VNI project is the first large-scale use of the SmartValve technology in Australia but Smart Wires APAC general manager Aidan Lawlor said the technology has been successfully implemented by the United Kingdom’s National Grid, across Europe, the USA and Latin America. “We have worked alongside Transgrid for three years to create the right solution for the VNI project with the use of SmartValve technology,” he said.
Nine SmartValve units have already been commissioned at Transgrid’s Stockdill substation, unlocking an extra 120 MW of additional energy to the NSW grid. Six of the units will be installed at Yass by the end of September with testing to get underway in October. These will unlock a further 50 MW of energy.
Commissioning of the units at Yass substation is expected by the end of 2022. The VNI upgrade is scheduled for completion in December.

EPC Power Corp., a US-based supplier of smart inverters for utility-scale solar installations, today announced the Sustainable Investing business within Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Cleanhill Partners acquired a majority stake in its company. The transaction closely follows the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which among other provisions, extends a first-ever tax credit to stand-alone energy storage, creating a significant financial incentive for clean energy technologies.
EPC Power, headquartered in San Diego, Calif. is an end-to-end power conversion solution provider. Its main products are designed for utility-scale applications as well as business and facility applications, and its smart inverters are designed for applications in standalone energy storage, solar energy storage and data center backup power. Going beyond the role of traditional inverters to feed power into the grid, smart inverters are powered by advanced software and work dynamically with the grid to increase resilience, reliability, safety, and security.
“EPC Power is uniquely positioned to play a critical role in the evolution of the U.S. solar and energy storage value chains and is now well capitalized to continue its trajectory of rapid growth,” said Alexander Mass, managing director of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “As the only scaled supplier of smart inverters that are designed, engineered and 100% manufactured in the U.S., EPC Power is a natural continuation of our thematic investment activity in this space, in partnership with Cleanhill Partners and EPC management.”
To date, EPC Power has sold more than 2 GW of smart inverters globally. Its first manufacturing facilities are in Poway in San Diego County, Calif., with a second U.S. manufacturing location on the East Coast scheduled to open in late 2022 to significantly expand production capacity. With a growing customer base in Europe, EPC Power also maintains an engineering and sales office in Helsinki, Finland. The company employs approximately 180 people.
“In an exploding market of cleantech innovators, EPC Power stands out for its industry-leading technology, which directly supports the renewable energy transition while preserving grid reliability and performance,” said Rakesh Wilson and Ash Upadhyaya, managing partners at Cleanhill Partners, which first invested in EPC Power in 2021 when it underwrote a credit facility to support its growth; since then, the firm has also provided counsel on operational matters and facilitated strategic partnerships to help the company achieve rapid scale. “As prior investors in EPC Power, we have every confidence that the company will meet its ambitious and environmentally critical objectives and we are excited to partner with Goldman Sachs for the next stage of EPC Power’s growth.”
The strategic investment positions EPC Power to further expand to be ready to meet the growing demand for renewable energy storage markets. Global energy storage installations are projected to multiply 20 times by the end of 2030 compared to the end of 2020, according to BloombergNEF’s 2021 Global Energy Storage Outlook, with the U.S. currently being the world’s largest market. Wood Mackenzie sees the United States on a path to be a 27 GW annual market by 2031, and 83% of that figure will be utility-scale storage.
