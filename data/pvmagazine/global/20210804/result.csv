Chinese inverter and storage system manufacturer Sungrow has completed one of wider Europe's largest energy storage projects, in the United Kingdom.
The Minety power plant has a capacity of 100 MW / 100 MWh and is intended to provide services for grid frequency regulation and maximize the use of renewable energies.
The project saw two 50 MW batteries developed by Penso Power and funded by state-owned China Huaneng Group and CNIC Corporation. Initially, the project was a single 50 MW battery completed in 2020, with a second battery added during 2021.
As a result of a short-term drop in network frequency, there was a large-scale power outage in the United Kingdom around two years ago. After that, the authorities gave priority to the construction of large storage facilities in order to prevent this kind of incident from happening again. The use of some of the large storage systems installed at the time, in fact, helped prevent a total failure of the country's electricity system.
Construction of the Minety large storage facility began at the end of 2019, for which Sungrow supplied both nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) and lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery solutions with a high level of integration. According to the company, this reduced the space requirement, shortened the commissioning time and reduced system costs by 5%.
The new large storage system fulfills the latest British frequency regulation requirement, dynamic containment. This means that the system has to react to the power instructions of the network within a second. Only about 30% of the large storage facilities in Great Britain are equipped with this function, according to Sungrow.
Shell Energy Europe Limited, the gas and electricity unit of the Anglo-Dutch fossil fuel giant, agreed to buy power from the project under a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA), though terms were not disclosed.

The project has an estimated investment of around $3.45 million and 10% of the sum will be provided by GEDF. The solar park is planned to generate 7,100,000 kWh per year.
GEDF specified it already conducted a feasibility study for the project and that it also prepared all the tender documentation for the selection of an EPC contractor.
Interested investors will have time until August 16 to submit their proposals.
The GEDF issued a tender for “purchasing consulting services” for the project in April 2017.
Georgia has had limited success with solar energy deployment to date. At the end of 2020, the country had only 1 MW of installed solar power. The country, however, currently hosts a 500 MW solar module factory owned and operated by US-based Aionrise that exports panels to the United States and Europe.
Around 78% of Georgia’s power comes from 2.4 GW of hydropower generation capacity, with the balance from 900 MW of thermal power plants. Electricity rates in the country are already low: reported to be in the neighborhood of two US-cents per kilowatt-hour.
*The article was amended on August 4 to specify that the 500 MW module factory is owned by US-based Aionrise and not AE Solar, as we previously reported.

QMM is a joint venture between Rio Tinto, which owns 80% of the company, and the government of Madagascar, which controls the remaining share.
The project will consist of an 8 MW PV facility relying on 18,000 solar panels linked to a 12 MW wind farm composed of nine turbines and will be owned and operated by the independent power producer CrossBoundary Energy (CBE). The PV system is expected to begin commercial operations at the beginning of 2022 and the wind facility by the end of next year.
The hybrid plant will also be connected to a lithium-ion storage system with a capacity of up to 8.25 MW, Rio Tinto said in a statement. “It will supply all of QMM’s electricity demand during peak generation times, and up to 60 percent of the operations’ annual electricity consumption,” it further explained. “QMM will replace the majority of the power it currently supplies to the town of Fort Dauphin and the community of around 80,000 people with renewables.”
More technical and financial details on the project were not revealed.
Rio Tinto has also used solar to power its mining operations in Australia, where it built a 6.7 MW solar array at its remote bauxite operation in Weipa, Queensland. The company also began to plan last year a $98 million solar + battery energy storage system at its Koodaideri mine in the Pilbara, Western Australia (WA).
The company is investing in solar PV and energy storage as it looks to reduce carbon emissions from its mining operations.

The cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 30.09% (taking into account the rear side performance).
The tandem device was built with a bifacial crystalline silicon perovskite-filtered heterojunction sub-cell, which the scientists described as able to absorb the solar spectrum from both the front and rear sides and achieve a significant enhancement compared with semitransparent amorphous silicon sub-cells, as it absorbs all solar spectra in the short-wavelength range.
The perovskite used in the sub-cell is methylammonium-lead (ΙΙ) iodide (CH3NH3PbI3). The hole and electron transport layers were developed with nickel(II) oxide (NiO) and PCBM, which is a solubilized version of the buckminsterfullerene C60, respectively.  The NiO was deposited through an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, while spin coating was used to coat the PCBM on the absorber layer. Commercial Czochralski-grown n-type crystalline silicon wafers with a thickness of 200 microns were utilized for the heterojunction cell. Layers of the amorphous silicon were grown on the cell via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition in a cluster system.
The researchers explained that in a traditional four-terminal perovskite/silicon configuration, the solar spectrum in the short-wavelength range is absorbed by the perovskite top sub-cell, while the remaining light is absorbed by the silicon heterojunction sub-cell beneath. “However, not all photons corresponding to bottom sub-cell’s optical bandgap can be yielded,” they further explained.
In the proposed cell configuration, the bifaciality increases the number of absorbed photons. “As a result, short-circuit current and the conversion efficiency of the crystalline silicon heterojunction bottom sub-cell improved from ~ 15.15 to 33.5 mA/cm2 and from 8.68 to 12.99%, respectively, when the albedo reflection increased from 0 to 0.5 sun,” the academics stated. “The albedo reflection intensity can be accurately adjusted in the range of 0–0.5 sun by altering the distance between the cell holder and illumination source.”
This efficiency increase was able to raise the cell's overall efficiency (including light reflected to the rear side) from 25.78 to 30.09%. The solar cell is presented in the paper Over 30% efficiency bifacial 4-terminal perovskite-heterojunction silicon tandem solar cells with spectral albedo, published in scientific reports. The research group comprises scientists from the Incheon National University and the Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) in South Korea, as well as the National University and the Ton Duc Thang University in Vietnam.
“This approach achieved a conversion efficiency exceeding 30%, which is higher than those of both the top and bottom sub-cells,” reads the study. “Notably, this efficiency is also greater than the Schockley–Quiesser limit of the single-junction c-Si solar cell (approximately 29.43%).”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/04/cutting-europes-energy-costs-through-interconnection/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,EUROPE",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 4, 2021",Cutting Europe‘s energy costs through interconnection,"As intermittent renewables come to represent a larger share of the energy mix in regions the world over, ensuring that energy is available where needed, and that electricity continues to run reliably, becomes more of a challenge.
Energy storage will play a key role in balancing grids powered by renewables. However, interconnection between countries and regions can be an effective alternative – since the regions will have different climates, weather patterns, and resource profiles, and importing energy between them serves to balance supply and demand on the combined grid.
Regional grid interconnections are the subject of new research from Stanford University’s Mark Jacobson. The latest paper examines various interconnection scenarios for 14 western-European regions (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom), based on all regions meeting 100% of their overall energy demand (not only electricity) from wind, water, and sunlight.

The study compares the costs of ‘fully interconnected’ versus ‘completely isolated’ grids in various iterations across the regions studied, taking in climate forecasts, grid integration data, and energy demand profiles. Full details of the model can be found in the paper The cost of grid stability with 100 % clean, renewable energy for all purposes when countries are isolated versus interconnected, published in Renewable Energy.
In every scenario modeled, the study found that interconnection resulted in lower energy costs and better grid stability than isolation. “The main implication of this work is that interconnecting countries can usually serve as an additional benefit to grid stability and cost reduction in a 100 % clean, renewable energy world,” reads the paper. Jacobson goes on to note that even for grids relying on fossil fuels, interconnection can serve to increase reliability and act as a hedge against unexpected events. “An isolated grid that has no outside electricity support may fail during an extreme weather event, as it did during the February 14e18, 2021 Texas storm,” Jakobson stated. “Such an outage could happen in any isolated grid.”
The model calculated that interconnection across all of the regions would make energy costs around 13% lower than in the isolated scenario, with the largest benefit coming from connecting Norway with Denmark and the rest of northwestern Europe, taking advantage of the Nordic country’s large hydropower capacity to bring about a 20.6% cost reduction.
While the cases compared in the study – full interconnection and complete isolation – don’t reflect the reality that most energy systems in Europe are interconnected to some degree, and will likely remain somewhere in between the two scenarios. Political limits to interconnection also complicate the picture further: “Limits can also arise if one country doesn't want to cede too much reliance of its energy security on the goodwill of its neighbors, fearing that a neighbor may shut off the electricity supply during a conflict,” the paper states. “This risk must be balanced by the lower cost and increased efficiency of a well-interconnected system.”
However, Jacobson states that these models can still allow relevant conclusions. “Showing that grids can stay stable at low cost with 100 % WWS and storage in both the isolated and fully-interconnected cases suggests they can stay stable at low cost in cases in-between,” he states in the paper. And though reality may add in some more complicating factors, the paper draws a clear conclusion that in most cases, increased interconnection will be a valuable tool in building low-cost, reliable energy systems reliant on 100% wind, water and sunlight.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/04/foreign-investors-tapping-into-indias-solar-market-undeterred-by-untimely-payments/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"AUGUST 4, 2021",Foreign investors tapping into India’s solar market undeterred by untimely payments,"From pv magazine India
Foreign investors are pairing up with local independent power producers to tap into India’s booming solar market despite problems with timely payments, land acquisition, and grid access, IHS Markit analysts say in a recent analysis of India’s PV market.
The analysts note that sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and Abu Dhabi, along with banks like Goldman Sachs, funds like Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP), and utilities such as Japan’s JERA currently hold sizeable stakes in solar projects led by Indian developers. Further, major banks like JP Morgan and Standard Chartered are prepared to underwrite many of the green bonds that Indian power producers are floating to add to their renewables portfolios.
India is eager to attract foreign investment as the country aims for 450 GW of installed renewable capacity. For investors, the nation’s solar market offers a high-growth area. 
“Foreign investors see India’s solar market as a high-growth area, and many are buying substantial stakes in local firms that know the market and operate successfully there,” Conway Irwin, IHS Markit’s climate and cleantech research director who analyzed the solar market data.
“Foreign investors also are flocking to India because they need “a home” for the $88 trillion they have pledged to meet the Paris Agreement goals to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels,” the analysis also quoted Tim Buckley, energy finance director for the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
And as the International Energy Agency noted in a July report on global electricity markets, India today represents the third-largest electricity consumer in the world. Demand is set to grow once it resumes economic activity that the COVID-19 pandemic brought to a crawl in the past two years.
IEEFA estimates India will need a $500-billion investment in new renewable installations to reach its 2030 goal of 450 GW, of which roughly half will be in solar, 20% in wind, about 10% in grid-firming technologies such as battery storage, and the rest devoted to upgrading grid distribution and transmission services.
Foreign investors are drawn to India as the nation offers up to 100% ownership in any renewable project in which they have a stake, something that China doesn’t allow. A 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) is another reason. The PPA is secured in some instances by sovereign guarantees via the Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited (SECI), which is under the administrative control of the Indian Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.
In this way, analysts say, foreign investors may be able to mitigate, but not eliminate entirely, the risk of untimely payments from individual state agencies—the purchasers of much of the renewable capacity. It also appears that some of the more successful renewable project developers in India have portfolios that are spread across various states, thereby allowing them to decrease their risk by avoiding putting all their eggs in one basket.
For the local renewable energy developers, IHS Markit said, “the promise of lower cost of capital associated with backing from stable, foreign financial institutions allows them to bid more competitively into price-sensitive markets in India than competitors that rely primarily on domestic funding sources.”
Investors look for prospects that will provide opportunities on a sensible, risk-adjusted basis, Buckley said. “And what India is offering is a $500-billion prospect of new investment in already government-guaranteed infrastructure assets in the renewables space,” the report quoted IEEFA’s Buckley.
In addition to the scale of capital deployment opportunities and strong, consistent energy policy framework offered, Indian renewable energy projects have historically provided “healthy project-level” equity returns in the range of 14-16% that are much higher than those available in say Germany or Japan, Buckley wrote in a February analysis of the global capital flows underpinning India’s transition to a low-to-zero carbon economy.
IHS Markit analysts agree. Independent power producers with strong foreign financial backing enjoy substantially lower capital costs because they can access lower-cost financing from overseas investors and avoid domestic borrowing costs that can run as high as 9-10%, said IHS Markit’s Irwin.
“The negatives posed by the lack of timely payments by state agencies, which are the largest purchasers of renewable energy, is more than offset by all the reasons for going into India in the first place,” Buckley said.

Joining South Australia’s Tindo Solar in the Australian made and owned solar manufacturing game, Sydney-based MSquare Energy (MSquare) claims to be the largest solar panel manufacturer in Australia with a fully automated facility. 
In what will be news to few, Sydney is currently in strict Covid-19 lockdown, meaning pv magazine Australia is not currently able to visit the MSquare’s facility, located in the western Sydney suburb of Toongabbie. 
However, what we know from an MSquare statement is that they’re currently operating a 300 MW manufacturing capacity fully automatic assembly factory making CEC approved panels up to 445W, with plans to bring M10 panels up to 590W all black into the line by October 2021. 


MSquare says it has already begun exporting some of its products to the United States, and has purchased a site in Kelso, near Bathurst, for a second manufacturing facility which it says will triple manufacturing capacity. 
According to MSquare, their “business goal is to become the leading solar panel manufacturing company in Australia”, an ambitious goal considering Tindo Solar secured $1 million federal funding in June to help it transition to new M10 cell technology and boost production capacity with a new $6 million state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Adelaide nearing completion.
What can be said for certain is that Australian module manufacturing industry is at a pivotal stage of development, and that MSquare is throwing their hat in the ring.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/04/crystal-arrangement-results-in-1000x-more-power-from-ferroelectric-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 4, 2021","Crystal arrangement results in 1,000x more power from ferroelectric solar cells","Combining ultra-thin layers of different materials can raise the photovoltaic effect of solar cells by a factor of 1,000, according to researchers at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) in Germany.
Their findings, published in the journal “Science Advances,” described a lattice arrangement of three different layers of ferroelectric crystals (in this case, of barium titanate, strontium titanate, and calcium titanate) that created a powerful solar energy producing effect.
Ferroelectric means that the material has spatially separated positive and negative charges. The charge separation leads to an asymmetric structure that enables electricity to be generated from light.
Ferroelectric crystals differ from conventional silicon cells in that they do not require a p-n junction to create the PV effect. In other words, there is no need to create positively and negatively doped layers within the cell. The researchers said that change could make solar panels easier to produce.
MLU researchers have been experimenting with barium titanate to take advantage of these properties. However, pure barium titanate does not absorb much sunlight; as a result, it generates a relatively low photocurrent. The research showed that combining ultra-thin layers of different materials can significantly increase a cell’s yield.
Researchers added a thin paraelectric layer to the cell. Although this layer does not have separated charges, it can become ferroelectric under certain conditions; for example, in low temperatures or when the chemical structure is slightly modified.
MLU physicist Dr. Akash Bhatnagar and his team discovered that a much stronger photovoltaic effect occurs when the ferroelectric layer alternates with not one, but two different paraelectric layers.
The team embedded barium titanate between strontium titanate and calcium titanate. This was achieved by vaporizing the crystals with a high-powered laser, redepositing them on carrier substrates. The result was a material made of 500 layers that was only about 200 nanometers thick.
The MLU team irradiated the cell with laser light to test the new material, and the results surprised them. Compared to pure barium titanate of a similar thickness, the current flow was up to 1,000 times stronger, despite the proportion of barium titanate having been reduced by almost two-thirds.
“The interaction between the lattice layers appears to lead to a much higher permittivity – in other words, the electrons are able to flow much more easily due to the excitation by the light photons,” Bhatnagar said.
The studies show the effect is also resilient as it remained nearly constant over a six-month test period. Further research is underway to understand what exactly causes this photovoltaic effect.
