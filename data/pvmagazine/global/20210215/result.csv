The company said that it wants to invest around €4 billion in the new factory, which will have an initial capacity of 45 GWh.
Italvolt is currently seeking to identify a location for the factory, with due diligence and evaluation exercises already underway at several sites in Italy. “With its gigafactory, Italvolt wants to give an important response to the historic opportunity of green industrialization, which is involving all production sectors across the board, with a socio-economic impact that will represent a turning point for the global economy,” Italvolt CEO Lars Carlstrom stated.
The project's first phase is expected to be finalized by the end of 2024. Italian car design firm and coachbuilder Pininfarina will be responsible for the architectural design of the new factory, while Italian industrial automation company Comau will provide the production equipment and will be responsible for the setting up of an R&D laboratory.
“When built, the factory will be the largest of its kind in Europe, and the 12th largest worldwide,” Italvolt said.
In Europe, there are currently at least three similar gigafactories in various stages of development: One under construction by U.S. electric car maker Tesla in Berlin, Germany; another planned by France-based battery cell producer Verkor in Rodez, about 150km northeast of Toulouse, and Northvolt's plans for production at sites in Sweden and Germany.

Spain deployed 4,639 MW of new renewable energy capacity in 2020, of which 3,256 MW was for photovoltaic installations, according to Spanish renewable energy association APPA Renovables.
Of the solar power installed last year, 623 MW corresponded to self-consumption facilities, which is a greater amount than the 596 MW indicated by Spanish PV trade body UNEF at the end of January, and 2,633 MW come from utility scale solar facilities.
For comparison, in 2019, new renewable energy capacity had totaled 7,177 MW and solar had a share of 3.97 GW. Most of that capacity was represented by the 3 GW of solar projects that the Spanish government had allocated in the auction held in 2017, for which the grid-connection deadline was December 31, 2019. As for last year, by contrast, large scale solar power that came online in 2020 was made mostly of unsubsidized solar projects under private power purchase agreements.
The largest of these projects is the 300 MW Talasol PV project developed by Israeli company Ellomay, and Iberdrola's 500 MW (590 MWac) Núñez de Balboa project in Usagre, near Badajoz.
The country's cumulative PV capacity reached approximately 11 GW at the end of December.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/15/spectral-splitting-filters-for-more-efficient-photovoltaic-thermal-panels/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 15, 2021",Spectral-splitting filters for more efficient photovoltaic-thermal panels,"Photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) solar panels have barely been developed thus far, compared to PV modules and solar-thermal panels. This is mainly due to their lower overall efficiency and longer payback times, as well as a number of technical challenges. Although a considerable number of PVT products are currently available for sale, such panels are usually produced by small companies on a limited scale, for sale in niche markets.
The combination of PV generation and heat production on a single device has not become attractive enough for consumers yet. But a research group from Imperial College London and Zhejiang University in China believes that this technology has strong potential for improvement. They have therefore created a framework to predict its performance and efficiency limits.
The scientists said that the choice of PV technology and the improvement of spectral-splitting (SS) filters, which are used to split the solar spectrum, will be key for the future success of PVT devices. These filters exploit the partial spectral sensitivity of PV cells and minimize, through different designs, the thermal coupling in PVT modules. This means that spectral splitting can direct different parts of the solar spectrum to suitable receivers, while avoiding the high temperatures of the thermal collector, which can compromise the efficiency of the PV devices.
However, there is still a lack of consensus about SS filters and their optimal design, operating conditions, and ultimate potential, the researchers said. “We have demonstrated that, if designed and operated appropriately, spectral-splitting photovoltaic-thermal collectors always have a higher efficiency than any combination of conventional solar PV panels and solar-thermal collectors,” said researcher Christos Markides, adding that current PVT devices rely on one of two spectral-splitting approaches, based on either absorptive optical filters or selectively reflective variants.
The first filter lets part of the solar spectrum pass through to the PV cells and then reflects the rest to a thermal absorber. The second filter only lets part of the solar spectrum go through to the PV cells. The British-Chinese group said that the efficiency of a PVT device depends on a coefficient that considers the relative value of thermal energy to that of electricity.
“Assuming that thermal losses can be minimized, the efficiency limit, optimal PV material and optimal filter all depend strongly on a coefficient ‘w,' which quantifies the value of the delivered thermal energy relative to that of the generated electricity,” the scientists explained. “The total (electrical plus thermal) efficiency limit of SS-PVT collectors increases at higher w and at higher optical concentrations.”
The overall efficiency of the SS-PVT panels is particularly sensitive to the bandgap energy of the PV material when “w” is lower than 0.5. The scientists claim that this corresponds with scenarios in which the electricity is at least twice as valuable as the generated thermal energy. They also said that photovoltaic-thermal modules are preferable to either of these standalone conventional technologies at intermediate temperatures.
“The total effective efficiency limit of SS-PVT collectors is over 20% higher than those of both standalone PV modules and ST collectors when ‘w' is in the range from 0.35 to 0.50 and is up to 30% higher at ‘w' of around 0.4,” they said.
They point to crystalline silicon and CIGS as the most suitable PV technologies with a coefficient “w” lower than 0.22. They said gallium-arsenide (GaAs) technologies are preferred when this value exceeds 0.22. Indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) should be considered when “w” surpasses 0.4. However, germanium and gallium phosphide may present some challenges due to their extreme bandgap energy, they added.
The scientists presented their findings in “Efficiency limits of concentrating spectral-splitting hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PV-T) solar collectors and systems,” which was recently published in Light: Science and Applications.

Bringing supply closer to demand in this way could allow solar to meet a big chunk of energy demand, whilst also alleviating many of the land usage and grid stability concerns that come with it.
As such, flexible solar is attracting plenty of interest from both researchers and commercial players. Solar cell materials, however, tend to be quite sensitive. Designing and manufacturing devices that can withstand the stress of being folded and bent is challenging, and many of even the most promising solutions seen to date are still quite limited in their flexibility.
Scientists at Pusan National University in South Korea took a major step forward in solving this problem, fabricating a device that can be folded down to a ‘bending radius’ – the minimum size of fold possible without causing damage – of 0.5mm. Their device is described in the paper Foldable Perovskite Solar Cells Using Carbon Nanotube‐Embedded Ultrathin Polyimide Conductor, published in Advanced Science. Starting with a perovskite cell material and a polymer substrate, the group demonstrated a device just seven microns thick, which could withstand being folded at a 0.5mm radius more than 10,000 times.
Key to this performance was the use of single-wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a transparent electrode layer. The CNTs were integrated into a polyimide substrate, which addressed expected problems with CNTs sticking to the substrate as the force was applied. This device was then doped with molybdenum oxide to increase its conductivity. A control device fabricated with a standard ITO electrode and polymer substrate showed severe performance degradation after 1,000 folds at a considerably larger bend radius, and could not withstand even one bend at 0.5mm.
The device achieved an impressive 15.2% efficiency, which the group claims is the highest ever achieved for any cell utilizing carbon nanotubes. Though the devices were producing at a small scale using spin-coating techniques, and the group has not investigated possibilities for larger volume processing here, the approach presents solutions to some of the issues that have held back CNT’s development for solar applications, and could greatly increase the possibilities for flexible PV in future.

The added financial muscle is expected to enable the EIF to play a big role in the bloc's InvestEU program, and particularly its focus on driving green and digital transformations.
European Commission executive VP Valdis Dombrovskis, quoted in an EIB press release on Friday, said of the move: “This means that the EIF will be fully equipped to implement the InvestEU program, to help EU businesses in emerging out of the [Covid-19] crisis, and to support the green and digital transformation of the EU economy.”

The company operates in the Laikipia West sub-county of Laikipia County, in central Kenya, and is fully owned by the County Government of Laikipia.
The selected developers will be responsible for financing, designing, and constructing the solar plant, as well as for the entire permitting process. The deadline to express interest in the project is February 23.
According to a recent study by researchers at Mohammed V University in Rabat, Morocco, reverse osmosis for water treatment can be maximized at lower energy consumption by powering it with solar PV. In this paper, the scientists showed that the combination of reverse osmosis with PV power generation can help to improve the rejection of chlorophenols in the water treatment process. Chlorophenols are toxic, colorless, and weakly acidic organic compounds that are ubiquitous contaminants in the environment.
Another study from the University of California, Berkeley, has illustrated the potential advantages and challenges of using PV to power electrochemical water treatment. These researchers analyzed how the use of solar power could increase the competitiveness of electrochemical approaches such as electrocoagulation (EC), capacitive deionization (CDI), electrodialysis (ED) and electrodeionization (EDI). The four methods examined, according to the scientists, are not as capital-intensive as traditional large scale water treatment centers while also being modular, portable and energy efficient. The use of solar could also make smaller electrochemical facilities suitable for desalination of brackish water in remote regions.

Amazon was the No. 1 U.S. corporate buyer of renewable energy in 2020, procuring more than 3.16 GW. Utility scale solar power also was the most sought-after renewable resource among the country’s major corporations.
That’s according to the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA), a member-based organization that represents and advocates on behalf of many of the nation’s largest corporate energy purchasers.
In its second annual Deal Tracker Top 10 report, REBA found that U.S. corporations once again showcased their resolve and commitment to renewable energy with a record-breaking 10.6 GW of contracted capacity.
REBA CEO Miranda Ballentine said: “It is remarkable that the business community announced nearly 100 new deals while managing the impacts of a global pandemic.”
REBA’s group members accounted for 97% of the procurements tracked in 2020. Of the 98 deals reflected in the full report, 72% were for utility scale solar projects.
Kara Hurst, vice president of sustainability at Amazon, said the company is making “big investments in wind and solar energy because it can help to quickly decarbonize our business operations.”
Amazon is on a path to run on 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of its original target of 2030. Building on Amazon’s procurements last year, the company has continued making solar deals in 2021.
“We believe all companies have a role to play in protecting the planet,” said Hurst. “To inspire collaboration, we co-founded The Climate Pledge–with signatories committing to reaching net-zero carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement.”
REBA said the companies in its report–half of which represent first-time energy buyers accounting for 25% of total announced volume–navigated market barriers through innovative contracting structures and collaboration with key stakeholders, including utilities, energy transaction parties, local communities, and industry leaders.
Although the information technology (IT) sector continued to represent the highest procurement by volume, the industrials and materials market was the top sector for new buyers, which REBA said indicates the importance of decarbonization of industrial supply chains.
According to REBA, 2020 was also the first year that multiple U.S. corporate energy buyers announced procurements including battery storage, aligning with broader industry trends as storage technology becomes more accessible.
Looking ahead, REBA said significant potential remains to grow the U.S. renewables market, and economy, through key federal policy priorities.
In January, the group helped lead more than 30 corporations–including Amazon, McDonalds, Pepsi Co, Walmart, and Facebook–to call on the Biden administration to help pave the way for a zero-carbon U.S. power sector.

Greenyellow Thailand, a subsidiary of the French solar company Greenyellow, which is itself a subsidiary of French mass-retail company Groupe Casino, has announced the commissioning of Thailand's first floating solar power plant.
The 2 MW plant was deployed in Thailand on the historic site of local agro-food company SPM group. The 6,000 solar panels used for the project occupy a 1.6ha area on a 4.3ha pond. The plant will produce 2.8 GWh of low carbon electricity per year, covering up to 20% of the annual energy consumption of the site.
According to Greenyellow, as the price of solar electricity sold to SPM is significantly lower than that of the electricity grid, this project will allow the group to achieve significant savings on its monthly electricity bill. SPM will also benefit from the maintenance and performance monitoring system provided by Greenyellow at no additional cost, the company said, noting that the project makes it possible to exploit an under-utilized basin.
“For the past 2-3 years, we are seeing a clear trend in the solar market with the commercial and industrial customers choosing the private PPA model where they outsource the capital expenditure (capex), the hassle and the operational risk to independent power producers (IPPs) like Greenyellow. This allows them to generate significant energy savings and focus their time and money on their core business, ”said Frank Glück, CEO of Greenyellow Thailand and Asia. 
Thailand aims to develop its capacity for floating PV installations, particularly on dams. According to Bloomberg, the country plans to install nearly 2.7 GW of solar capacity on nine dams by 2037. In June 2019, the Thai Government Electricity Authority issued a call for tenders to develop 55 MW of floating solar. Four months later, French floating PV specialist Ciel&Terre, and SCG, an Asian petrochemical company, signed a memorandum of understanding to develop floating PV systems on hydroelectric dams in Thailand.
Greenyellow was established by Groupe Casino in 2007. In 2016, the company obtained authorization to implement the sale of power to final clients and power providers through its subsidiary, Greenyellow Vente d’Énergie. It has mainly deployed solar projects on France’s mainland and overseas territories and in French-speaking Madagascar. In 2018, Greenyellow joined forces with France’s energy giant Engie by creating a common subsidiary that will be primarily active in the development, construction, operation, and maintenance of PV power plants. The unit is specifically dedicated to solar production for B2B.

Germany’s 2021 EEG places a hurdle at 300 kWp for rooftop PV systems. While projects of this size and above are not required to participate in the public tender process, abstaining means that they automatically forego remuneration for 50% of the energy they feed into the grid. This new option seems so unattractive that many will for the time being prefer the old scheme, in which operators of rooftop systems up to 750 kWp are entitled to full remuneration for the power their systems generate. For installations designed according to the old rules, there is a deadline of March 31, 2021, when rooftop systems up to 750 kWp must be connected to qualify for the full feed-in tariff.
Industry players know all too well what such a deadline means: A scramble for all of the panels and inverters available by mid-March is already running at full tilt. Unfortunately, this has been exacerbated by the fact that Chinese manufacturers cut back on production volumes, and in particular on delivery volumes to Europe, at the end of last year. Raw materials prices rose across the board over the course of 2020, presumably due to pandemic-related production shortfalls in the spring. This caused bottlenecks and price increases, which made inexpensive modules hard to come by.
Even more dramatic, however, is the bottleneck in the logistics sector. Freight prices from Asia to Europe have increased almost fivefold in recent months. This sharp rise, which accounts for the largest proportion of current module price increases, is probably due to the lack of return freight to Asia. In European seaports, containers – both full and empty – are piling up, and that is squeezing the supply in Shanghai and Shenzhen. The pandemic has meant that for some time now fewer goods are being exported from the United States and Europe to Asia, rather than vice versa. The lack of affordable transport has likely resulted in many modules being sold and installed in Asia.
In China, after a weak first half of 2020, there was a race to catch up to 40 GW of new PV capacity. In 2021, this trend is expected to continue, with up to 50 GW of new installations. Accordingly, supply capacities for Europe are likely to be limited for some time. The Lunar New Year is also just around the corner. Time will tell whether travel around the country leads to another extensive lockdown in China, as was the case in 2020. After last year’s lockdown, it was impossible to imagine a regular flow of production and distribution of important goods for several months.
Overall, we should expect a further module price increase of $0.02 to $0.03 per watt-peak in the commercial and large-scale plant segment for future deliveries. In the already higher-priced small plant segment, the increase might be less pronounced. The current sharp surplus in demand will settle down somewhat after March 31, at least in Germany. Modules in the higher-efficiency range will probably be somewhat easier to come by in April and May.
For most in the PV sector, 2020 went comparatively well. After the first few months in the tight grip of the pandemic, something akin to normality returned to the solar market. Prices were on target, orders were in the pipeline, and for the first time it was possible to plan for the future. In December, which was slowed by the lockdown, everyone had been preparing for a quiet Christmas and did not want to hear anything about precautions and materials hedging. Thus, most players unfortunately did not see the dark clouds gathering.
Then in the first few weeks of January came a rude awakening. Suddenly, nothing seemed to fit together anymore, long-term plans were not working out, and supposed winners were turning into losers. Manufacturers, for instance, are dissatisfied with contract prices from 2020, which they can no longer maintain without incurring losses. In some cases, agreed selling prices are already 10% below current procurement costs. But fierce resistance from contractual partners means it is seldom possible to raise agreed prices. Suppliers can only hope that they will be allowed to deliver the quantity owed at a later date, when production costs come back down to earth.
Module buyers’ are not much better off. At the very least, installers for plants up to to 750 kW that have failed to make timely preparations are now likely to be in a world of hurt. They neither have access to the materials they need at the conditions they had previously calculated, nor sufficient time to procure and install new installations. There are simply not enough modules left on the market that can be delivered by the deadline. Everything that does arrive in time is sold to the highest bidder at steep markups. In fact, the products that are available are coming from those who made provisions in time but do not have to meet a deadline. Many of us know this type of hustle, not only from the stock market, but from the early years of the EEG, when the feed-in tariff degression kicked in on Dec. 31, and in the depths of winter, during the holidays, assembly and installation work had to keep going. This time, however, the deadline falls in spring, when temperatures will hopefully have risen again and work on the rooftops will be a bit more pleasant.

“This impressive efficiency was achieved by optimizing the bandgap and the efficiency of both the rigid semi-transparent perovskite top cell and the flexible CIGS bottom cell,” the research group said, adding that the results represent a world record for such a cell.
MiaSolé's 20%-efficient CIGS cell was fabricated in a roll-to-roll process on steel foil. The 17.5%-efficient semi-transparent perovskite solar cell was developed on glass.
The perovskite device, which was placed on top of the tandem structure, was designed to maximize the visible light conversion, while also maximizing the infrared light transparency, in order to allow the majority of infrared light to reach the bottom CIGS cell.
“This approach resulted in an efficiency of 17.5% for the top device, measured at the maximum powerpoint, tracked for five minutes,” the scientists said.
Solliance and the Energy Research Center of the Netherlands (ECN) said in March 2018 that they had recorded a 26.3% efficiency rate on a transparent perovskite solar cell combined with a crystalline silicon solar cell. A month later, Solliance also announced a new record performance for large-area perovskite modules, with a 14.5% conversion efficiency level.
In January 2019, Solliance achieved a 21.5% efficiency rate for a flexible copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) tandem solar cell based on perovskite. In November 2019, MiaSolé announced a new record of 18.64% for a flexible CIGS cell. The landmark achievement represents a significant improvement on the previous record of 17.44%, set five months earlier.
Hanergy and Solliance first teamed up in April 2017, when they signed a memorandum of understanding to strategically collaborate in the area of integrated solar solutions for buildings and infrastructure.

The first 400 MW stage of the New England Solar Farm near Uralla in New South Wales has reached financial close, thanks to debt financing from Bank of China, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and Westpac. 
Joint venture UPC/AC Renewables Australia (UPC Renewables and AC Energy) said that construction on the first stage of the project started at the end of 2020. The lead contractor, Spanish infrastructure development group Elecnor, started early works through its subsidiary, Green Light Contractors, with an initial focus on substation and road design. 
The New England Solar Farm will eventually become a 720 MW solar installation combined with a 400 MWh battery energy storage system on site. It is hoped this first stage of the enormous project will be connected to the National Energy Market (NEM) and produce clean solar energy by July 2022. It is tentatively set to be fully operational by the end of 2023.
Of the 400 MWh lithium-ion battery storage facility planned for the site, UPC/AC Renewables plans for the first 50 MWh, which is supported by the New South Wales government’s AUD 75 million ($58.4 million) Emerging Energy Program, to be operational by mid-2022, along with the first stage of solar installation. 
As the largest hybrid solar and battery project in Australia, the New England Solar Farm’s two solar fields sit within the area of the recently announced New England Renewable Energy Zone (REZ). However, the project was planned and had connection to transmission approved by TransGrid before the 8 GW REZ (the second to be set on a path to development by the New South Wales government) was announced in July 2020. 

“It’s exciting to achieve financial close on a merchant basis for such a large project, which is the first of many such projects we have in Australia,” said UPC/AC Renewables Australia CEO Anton Rohner. “UPC/AC Renewables Australia views this project fitting into the New South Wales government roadmap and look forward to being engaged in this process to help lower electricity prices.”
UPC Renewables Executive Chairman Brian Caffyn added that this is “a very large energy project even for Australia and we are proud to be associated with the New England Solar Farm and the local community and helping to transition New South Wales toward a clean, lower cost energy future.”
