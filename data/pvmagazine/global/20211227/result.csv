The estimated cost for the project is around US$7 million.
Developer Soudia Agro Solar PV Power Plant Ltd – a joint venture between Solarland China and local company Mostafa Motors – is expected to sign a power purchase and implementation agreement with the Bangladesh Power Development Board for the project on Dec. 29.
An electricity tariff of $0.1074/kWh has been set and the government will buy the generated electricity for a period of 20 years. The project is expected to be completed by next October and will be connected to the Bera-1 33/11kv PBS-2 Substation.
Chinese PV inverter manufacturer Huawei will supply its string inverters and smart transformer station for the project while the developer has invited tenders for the selection of an EPC contractor. No further supplier details were released.
The land for the project is classified as normal agricultural fertile land and the developer has it will introduce special technologies for the different types of agricultural work expected, including five specially designed solar mounting structures. It declined to elaborate further on these, however,
It did say a major portion of the area under the solar panels will be used for farming local chickens, ducks, goats, sheep, bees, and other domestic animals. Vertical crops will also be planted for different types of berries and a greenhouse is also expected to be installed, although no further details were disclosed on this either.
“Considering the scarcity of land in Bangladesh and high potentiality for solar projects, the combination of solar and agriculture will be the best choice here,” project director Abdul Gaffar told pv magazine.
Since 2014, around 2,800 Agri-PV systems have reportedly been deployed worldwide, with a total capacity of about 2.9GWp. Regulatory frameworks and support schemes are already in place in Japan, South Korea, China, France, and Massachusetts, the US, and are reportedly under development in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, India, and California, the US.
It wasn’t until 2019, however, that this niche market really began to take root. Over the past two years, research, policy discussions, and projects have gained traction, while the first agrivoltaics conference was held last October, attracting over 350 participants from 38 countries. In Q1 2021, pv magazine's UP Initiative shined a spotlight on agrivoltaics in recognition of this emerging market. You can read a summary of our coverage here.

Trends in PV manufacturing this year have proven that large format solar modules are here to stay. Since 2019, when PV wafer manufacturers began to introduce larger formats to the market, there has been much debate over the ideal size for a cell or module. This year has seen virtually all major PV manufacturers adopt either the 182mm or 210mm formats. While the debate continues over which of these offers the biggest advantage, it is now unlikely that we will see a shift back to anything smaller in mainstream production.
The first installations featuring modules based on either of the new cell formats have been completed, test installations are underway – and the backers of both formats claim an energy yield advantage in the field. Since it requires fewer changes and therefore lower risk in system design, the 182mm format looks to have the largest share for now. Standards are emerging, which should make things easier on the system and component design side. And analysts expect to see the 210mm format become more widely accepted further into the current decade.
Aside from the format switch, n-type technologies have been the other big news on the PV manufacturing side. Tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) and heterojunction (HJT) have waited in the wings for the past few years, and will still only represent a small chunk of the market in 2021. Major commitments from the biggest PV cell and module manufacturers, however, mean that major market growth for n-type is all but assured in the next few years. And initially at least, TOPCon looks to be the more cost effective of the two main n-type technologies, particularly for those manufacturers already operating large PERC manufacturing lines – which can be adapted to TOPCon, while heterojunction will require an all-new cell production line and a considerably higher investment cost.
Installations of ground and rooftop-mounted PV modules will still be the norm for solar; however, the past year has also seen big steps in the technology carving out new niches for itself. Promising and practical developments in agrivoltaics, building-integrated PV, floating PV and many more all point to the promise of integrating solar into our existing environments, and the direction the future could take.

In October, pv magazine USA announced that Meyer Burger Technology AG planned to set up a PV module manufacturing facility in the US; however, the location was not disclosed. Today, Meyer Burger announced that it is establishing a production site for high-performance solar modules in Goodyear, Arizona.
Initial annual production capacity is expected to be 400MW by the end of 2022, with the potential to scale to 1.5GW capacity in the future. At full 1.5GW potential capacity, the facility will provide over 500 skilled manufacturing jobs
“Meyer Burger is thrilled to be establishing roots in Arizona and expanding our footprint to the United States,” said CEO Gunter Erfurt. “My sincere thanks to our partners in Arizona for their support throughout this process. Solar energy will be critical to achieving U.S. and global clean energy goals, and our proprietary heterojunction cell technology and patented SmartWire module technology enable us to produce products of the highest quality and performance in order to offer our customers economically competitive solar components.”
Initial production capabilities will enable the company to manufacture PV modules for residential, commercial & industrial rooftop, and utility-scale solar applications. Production is expected to be operational by the end of 2022. Meyer Burger has entered into a lease as the first tenant of a recently constructed new building at market conditions.
Long known as a manufacturer of PV production equipment, Meyer Burger pivoted in the summer of 2020 to producing machines for heterojunction, smartwire manufacturing exclusively for its own use. At the same time, the company announced that it would no longer supply its technology to third parties and discontinued its partnership with REC Group.
“We are thrilled Meyer Burger has chosen Goodyear for their first manufacturing facility in the U.S.,” said Arizona Governor Doug Ducey. “The company’s new solar module manufacturing facility will further enhance Arizona’s standout reputation as a renewable energy leader”
Meyer Burger has begun hiring key personnel to support the installation of equipment and the initial startup of the facility. The company intends to continue hiring through 2022 in order to train personnel and ramp production quickly.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/27/stepping-up-in-2021-1-how-agri-pv-could-address-two-of-the-biggest-sustainability-challenges-of-our-times/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",BECKY BEETZ,"DECEMBER 27, 2021",Stepping UP in 2021: #1 How agri-PV could address two of the biggest sustainability challenges of our times,"This September, legendary broadcaster David Attenborough released the documentary, A life on our planet. In it, he said that preserving biodiversity is one of the key issues we face. At the same time, research published by the University of Oxford found emissions from the world’s food system – said to account for around 30% of total global emissions – could increase temperatures by 1.5°C, even if we “immediately” halted fossil fuel emissions.
These threats may appear detached from the solar industry. However, PV is not only uniquely positioned to address our addiction to fossil fuels. A growing body of evidence shows it could also prove key to solving biodiversity loss and intensive agriculture challenges, including deforestation, soil erosion, land conflicts, pesticides, drought, and desertification.
Building PV for the future: Financiers and investors have always understood that PV power plants play a more prominent role than just generating profits – they also produce electricity without emitting carbon. Lately, the sector is discovering that PV can fulfill a much larger range of environmental functions – improving biodiversity, removing carbon from enriched soils, and producing food in an environmentally sustainable way.
Orchardvoltaics – it’s just ripe: How do you feed a growing population with limited agricultural space, and ensure that the global trend of smashed avocado toast lives on? In Israel, Doral Energy is facing this question head-on with its innovative agri-PV concept, ‘orchardvoltaics’, which purportedly boosts farmers’ profits, increases crop yields and helps realize ambitious renewable energy goals.
PV in the water-energy-food nexus: Sector coupling may be somewhat of a buzzword, but it also points to opportunities for PV beyond the power markets, which may quickly reach limitations during peak hours of irradiation. Combined energy, food, and clean water production present one such opportunity, with benefits for developers, utilities, and communities.
Solar’s flexibility can be agriculture’s gain: Both solar and the farming industry are beginning to see potential in the combined use of land for food production and energy generation. And as innovators begin to experiment with different forms, it’s becoming clear that in most cases it is solar that will have to bend to the needs of agriculture, and not the other way around, to ensure a positive outcome.
An inclusive, rural European Green Deal through agrisolar: Combinations of sustainable agriculture with solar PV systems have immense potential in the EU, writes Miguel Herrero, policy adviser at SolarPower Europe, and the coordinator of the organization’s agrisolar workstream. According to SolarPower Europe’s most recent policy briefing, if agrisolar is deployed on just 1% of arable land, it could deliver more than 700 GW of technical capacity, amounting to more than 25% of the EU’s current electricity consumption. If the EU taps this potential, it could lead the world in this efficient global solar PV innovation.
An endless appetite for PV: With a growing demand for healthy fruit and vegetables, both plastic and glass greenhouses are increasingly supplying Chinese tables. Rene Moerman, the founder of China-based Xilia, toured several sites where solar PV has been integrated into greenhouses.
Raspberry PV protects the crop and avoids waste: An agrivoltaic project in the Netherlands demonstrates the compatibility of solar PV power generation and raspberry cultivation. The solar roof protects the plants, saves the farmer's work, and only has a minimal impact on the harvest.
Agrivoltaics: Where are we heading?: The complexity of agrivoltaics is not rocket science, but rather lies in the field’s various interdisciplinary challenges, says Max Trommsdorff, head of group agrivoltaics at Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE. Should agrivoltaics be deployed with interspace cropping, or should we use stilted PV systems that allow for cultivation below? And can the sector flourish without regulation?
PV for biodiversity: PV’s contribution to a cleaner future can go well beyond generating emissions-free energy, but maximizing the opportunity is not always straightforward. Ragna Schmidt-Haupt, a partner at Everoze and a board member at Skyray, argues that investors and lenders must start making decisions today to fulfill the required disclosure regulations and make sure their fleet has a positive impact on biodiversity. The key challenge is to weigh the techno-economic-ecological risks, opportunities, costs, and revenues.

An announcement from the government’s Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Organization (SATBA) states that the factory was inaugurated in a ceremony attended by Iran’s Minister of Energy Ali Akbar Mehrabian, and other officials.
Mehrabian stated that with this factory and cooperation from others in the renewable energy sector, Iran would be able to set higher targets for renewable energy in its development plans. “Today, in response to questions related to the effects of fossil energy use, including water and fuel consumption, pollution,… it can be noted that the development of renewable energy is the answer to all these questions,” the minister said at the event.

The factory is operated by Tehran-headquartered company Mana Energy Pak. The company’s website states that it has additionally purchased a factory able to produce 1.2GW of multi- and monocrystalline wafers per year, without mentioning the location of this factory. It also states that it has operated a 250MW production line for PV modules at the site near Khomeini since early 2020. According to SATBA, further phases already under construction will increase the factory’s PV module capacity to 1.5GW by the end of 2023.
The factory will be the first in Iran or the wider Middle East region to produce silicon solar cells. Though several countries in the region have made big steps in developing renewable energy projects, and there has been some appetite for local manufacturing, this has so far not grown beyond a few module assembly facilities.
Iran generates the majority of its energy from oil and gas and has not met a target of 5% renewables by the end of 2021. In November, however, SATBA issued a call for proposals for up to 10 GW of new renewables generation capacity to be built over the next four years. In early December, the organization reported that it had received more than 80 GW worth of proposals.

China’s PV demand is expected to reach as high as 70 GW next year. InfoLink projects that global module demand will range between 196 GW and 212 GW, up more than 20% on 164 GW this year. In the meantime, the rising deployment of solar+storage will accelerate steady solar growth. On the storage side, InfoLink predicts that the total number of homes equipped with solar will pass 11 million, while storage will hit 1.5 million, across four of the leading markets Germany, Japan, Australia and the United States by the end of the year.
The international trade situation and China’s power rationing pose major threats to 2022 deployments. If China relaxes power rationing next year, the pace of PV module price decreases will be subject to polysilicon prices. Polysilicon manufacturers will work toward bringing new capacity online as scheduled, amid high gross margins. Against this backdrop, annual polysilicon production is expected to reach 700,000 MT, which is enough to supply approximately 255 GW of end-user demand.
However, vertically integrated companies continue to ramp up their in-house wafer capacity, while new wafer players such as Gaojing and Shuangliang are also expanding. Large volumes of new wafer capacity will push up demand for polysilicon, and the newly installed furnaces require three to six months to ramp up fully. Therefore, the supply of polysilicon is expected to remain tight in the first half of 2022, with prices decreasing too slowly to ease high PV module cost pressures. Polysilicon prices are expected to hover around CNY 190/kg ($26.35/kg) by mid-2022. If the United States continues its sanctions against Xinjiang, polysilicon prices in regions outside of China may be slightly higher.
Polysilicon prices are projected to decline quarter on quarter, as polysilicon supply grows. If module prices remain high, PV plants that have halted installation will try to postpone as long as possible to secure better module prices. In light of this, module prices and overall demand will impact each other next year. If module prices decrease markedly, overall module demand will increase.
While capacity expansion continues across the supply chain, uncertainties caused by power rationing and international tensions will lead to low module orders for the first quarter of 2022. Consequently, module prices, which stayed at $0.28/W to $0.29/W, finally showed signs of decline in November. Meanwhile, prices for other components such as glass also began to slip. It’s expected that a slow downward trend in module prices will begin in the first half of 2022.
In early November, the U.S. Department of Commerce rejected anti-circumvention petitions, providing breathing space to manufacturers with capacity in Southeast Asia. If anti-circumvention is no longer an issue next year, capacity expansion projects in Southeast Asia will continue as planned, with 15 GW of capacity addition expected for both the PV cell and module segments.
In addition to the Xinjiang issue, which has caused polysilicon prices to move unsteadily, the U.S. Withhold Release Order (WRO) also put Southeast Asia-based businesses on watch. Thus, production lines in the region are not likely to return to full capacity utilization until this uncertainty is overcome.
Southeast Asia aside, wafer, cell and module capacity expansions are concentrated in China. Because of the rapid shift to large-format products, global wafer, cell, and module capacity are each set to grow more than 140 GW this year. The cell segment saw the largest volume of additional capacity, reaching around 180 GW. Given new production lines are more competitive, capacity across the supply chain will continue to grow next year, with the wafer and cell segment each adding 100 GW of new capacity.
The combined capacity of wafer, cell, and module will outgrow end user demand and surpass 350 GW by the end of the year. Production costs of conventional format modules are higher by CNY 0.01/W than the large-format ones, and as sales of conventional format modules are low, older production lines will be eliminated next year. However, those installed for PERC around three to five years ago may simply be left idle.
As most manufacturers started production of large-format products with the 182mm format, modules featuring 182mm cells and a power rating of 535 W to
545 W will see the largest share, followed by the 210 mm format. Cell numbers and layout vary across manufacturers. The two formats will together make up more than 70% of next year’s share, while M6 and smaller-format modules will continue to be used in the rooftop sector.
In terms of cell technology, PERC cells began to see profits decreasing to nil due to overcapacity. Meanwhile, manufacturers are expanding tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) and heterojunction (HJT) capacity, both n-type products. After China successfully localized production of the factory equipment to produce these cell technologies, the required investment per gigawatt has fallen from $35 million to $28 million for TOPCon, and from $62 million to $55 million for HJT this year, a significant reduction bringing them closer to the $22 million/GW required by PERC. It appears that TOPCon capacity additions will reach 20 GW to 30 GW next year, while HJT may see a 15 GW to 20 GW expansion.
As equipment cost reductions will reach a limit, the optimization of manufacturing costs will continue. Metallization cost reductions will remain key next year, while n-type cells will help reduce costs through adopting large wafers. With the combination of large wafers and large module designs, the market is expected to see n-type modules featuring power outputs higher than 600 W.
It seems that prices for TOPCon modules will be $0.02/W higher than PERC modules, which will already be an appealing price point for end users. Therefore, TOPCon will outgrow HJT in terms of capacity and production.
Nevertheless, PERC products are currently the most mature and cost competitive on the market. So, it’s expected that n-type products will stay in the promotion and preparation phase next year, and the market share will grow slowly and steadily from 4% this year to 6% to 7%.

Solar stocks performed poorly in the month of November, with the Invesco Solar ETF trading down 7%, underperforming the broader market and major indices such as the S&P 500, which was up 1.7%. The top five performing solar stocks in the U.S. market include Applied Materials, Inc. (6.7%), Enphase Energy, Inc. (4.6%), JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. (2.2%), and Array Technologies, Inc. (0.9%).
As far as the U.S. market is concerned, solar’s underperformance this month can be tied to new legislation making its way through the capital. The elimination of the bifacial exemption/exclusion by the U.S. government was refused by the U.S. Court of International Trade. Module providers may now import bifacial modules into the United States, and the industry will avoid the section 201 import duties.
This comes as a big surprise to us. We expect that the Department of Justice will file an appeal against the decision, although the time frame for this is unknown at this stage. We expect it to take longer than two months.
The chances of the DOJ succeeding are high. Some are stating a 99% chance of a successful appeal, however we believe the likelihood is between 50% and 75%. The current situation is a big negative for domestic thin film producer First Solar, and a major positive for other utility scale companies that serve the U.S. market.
In other public policy developments, the House also passed H.R. 5376/Build Back Better Act 220-213, following a nine-hour delay from House Minority Leader McCarthy (Republican, California). The measure is now on its way to the Senate.
If the House rejects the Senate’s version of the legislation, House and Senate leaders must agree on a conference report. All eyes will be on senior senators Joseph Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema in the coming weeks.
