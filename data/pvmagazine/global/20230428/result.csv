The study identifies primary policy variables such as the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives for hydrogen production, carbon pricing, and hydrogen supply targets, while energy costs are the primary market variable. As for existing gaps, a carbon tax, safety regulations, and further R&D grants could also aid the hydrogen economy if implemented. They said carbon taxes could encourage the use of hydrogen, unlike incentive programs such as the IRA, which focus on production.
Ohmium has secured $250 million in a Series C funding round. It said the funds will enable it to expand to 2 GW of annual manufacturing capacity and support projects in the United States, Europe, India, and the Middle East. The money will also support research and development programs to reduce the cost of green hydrogen production, said the manufacturer of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer systems. 
Worley and Advisian will assess Xcel Energy's natural gas system in the United States to determine the feasibility of injecting and blending hydrogen into its 36,000 miles of distribution pipeline and 2,200 miles of transmission pipeline. Once the assessment is finished in July, it will provide Xcel Energy with the data needed “to guide informed decisions on how to proceed with upgrades and adaptations to their midstream infrastructure,” said Worley.
BP, Gasunie, Nowega, NWO, Salzgitter, Thyssengas, and Uniper have signed a letter of intent to link their hydrogen projects in northwestern Germany. The alliance aims to connect Wilhelmshaven as a future site for hydrogen import and production with the industrial consumption centers in North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony. BP and Uniper are planning projects in Wilhelmshaven to import and produce hydrogen. Gasunie, Nowega, NWO, and Thyssengas, meanwhile, are working on modifying existing transport pipelines and on the construction of new H2 pipelines.
H-Tec Systems has started building a development site for PEM electrolyzer stacks in Hamburg. “In future, the H-Tec Systems Stack Manufacturing and Development Center will combine stack development, production, testing and service at one single location,” said the German company.Automated production will provide a potential total electrolysis capacity of up to 5 GW through PEM electrolysis stacks. The production line should be ready in 2024. Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) funded the automated factory's construction. The aim is to research processes to produce PEM electrolysis stacks and electrolyzers in Germany.
Hynion Sweden has secured a grant of SEK 61.4 million ($5,94 million) from the Swedish Energy Agency to build two more hydrogen refueling stations in Sweden.

The Public Advocates Office (PAO) for the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has proposed adding a monthly fixed charge on electric utility bills based on income level. The proposed rate change aims to lower bills for the lowest-income residents, while aligning billing more directly with utility costs.
Under the PAO's recommended Income Graduated Fixed Charge, customers not enrolled in the California Alternative Rates for Energy (CARE) program would be charged fees ranging from $22 to $42 per month, depending on their territory. CARE customers would be charged between $14 and $22 a month, depending on income level and territory.
For households earning $50,000 or less per month, the fixed charge would be $0, but only if the California Climate Credit is applied to offset the fixed charge. Meanwhile, the PAO proposal lowers usage-based electricity rates. Average rates would be reduced by 16% to 22% for the three major investor-owned utilities.
The lowest-income Californians are expected to save about $10 to $20 a month under the proposal, while middle-income customers may see their costs rise by about $20 a month. The PAO said it expects that the vast majority of low-income customers (earning $50,000 or less per year) will see their monthly bills decrease by $10 or more, while a small proportion of the highest income earners (earning $100,000-ülus per year) will see their monthly bills rise by $10 or more.
The proposed charges aim to help suppress rising rates for electricity generation and transmission, which are among the highest in the country. Rates are expected to continue to rise sharply as wildfire mitigation efforts are implemented by utilities found at fault for their origin.
“We are very concerned. We do not see the increases stopping at this point,” Linda Serizawa, deputy director for energy, PAO, told pv magazine. “In fact we think the pace and scale of the [rate] increases is growing faster than we would have anticipated, for several years now.”

“On April 27, 2023, the Clementy Group terminated the Investment Contract because of the various defaults of Fimer’s shareholders,” Clementy Group said in a statement. “Notwithstanding the Clementy Group’s readiness to enter the Procedure, including with a proposal for a €50 million proof of funds and initial disbursement of €30 million in the coming weeks, Fimer’s shareholders failed, amongst various other repeated defaults the investment contract, and numerous irregularities, to deliver the Clementy Group with the necessary instruments to proceed with such investment.”
Clementy Group said that Fimer’s shareholders failed to issue shares that were needed for Clementy’s investment.
“As recently highlighted by the Court of Arezzo, Fimer’s shareholders also failed to ensure a continued governance for the Company, causing high instability to the Company, and leading one of its crediting institutions to pause its credit lines to Fimer,” it added, claiming that Fimer has defaulted on approximately €300 million of debt.
At the time of the publication, Fimer had not responded to pv magazine‘s requests to comment on the matter.
Fimer announced an industrial relaunch after entering composition-with-creditors proceedings at a tribunal in Arezzo, Italy, in September. The company filed for creditor protection with the same court in February. According to Italian legislation, the composition-with-creditors procedure is a contractual settlement between a debtor and its creditors. The arrangement gives a business the chance to restructure its debt obligations and continue as a going concern.
The company presented its new industrial plan to the tribunal in late June.
Fimer has two inverter factories in Italy and one in India. It acquired the inverter business of Swiss conglomerate ABB in 2020. The company employs more than 1,000 people throughout the world and is present in more than 20 countries, with local training centers and manufacturing sites
“Clementy Group’s plan for Fimer included a significant expansion on the markets of United States of America, and on the Asian markets, where Fimer enjoys an excellent competitive advantage on the premium segments,” Clementy Group said in today's statement.

New highs in renewable energy generation, including record average output from rooftop solar, has resulted in the lowest demand in the National Electricity Market (NEM) in the March quarter since 2005, according to AEMO's latest market intelligence report.
AEMO’s Q1 Quarterly Energy Dynamics report shows the average output of rooftop solar reached a record 2,962 MW for the first three months of 2023. The market operator said this was up 23% compared with the same period in 2022, reflecting resumption of high distributed PV installation growth rates after a slowdown in 2022.
Generation from large-scale solar and wind surged during the quarter by an average of 330 MW and 134 MW, respectively, yielding a record quarterly average of 4,654 MW, which was 11% higher than the same period last year. The increases in grid-scale solar and wind output were attributed, in part, to new and recently commissioned units coming online.
AEMO reported that the record solar generation resulted in an instantaneous penetration of renewable energy peak at 65.8% during the quarter, but it was mostly about 37% of total power generation. At the high, which was up 4.4% on the previous record, rooftop solar accounted for 36% of supply.
On Feb. 11, 2023, rooftop solar output peaked, reaching a record high of 11,504 MW, up 818 MW from the previous high achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022.
AEMO Chief Executive Officer Daniel Westerman said the insights highlight the fundamental changes underway as Australia’s energy system transitions from fossil fuels to renewable sources.
However, Westerman said the report also reinforces the need for more investment in new transmission infrastructure and “firming technology” to help the grid cope with the switch, noting that a number of major renewable energy projects in the Murray region of Victoria and southwest NSW were unable to supply their full capacity to the grid because of constraints in the transmission network.
“These insights reinforce that critical transmission investments, such as VNI West and EnergyConnect, are needed to share low-cost, low-emission renewable energy with consumers,” he said.
“This is clear with the projects in Victoria’s Murray River renewable energy zone that are burdened with generation impacts.”
In spite of constraint concerns, the growth in renewables helped deliver new records for minimum demand, drove wholesale electricity costs down to historic levels, and helped reduce emissions to record lows as coal-fired and gas generation decreased.
The record levels of solar generation contributed to the lowest operational demand for the first quarter of the year since Tasmania joined the NEM in May 2005, at 14,375 MW.
The AEMO report shows that operational demand declined to 21,181 MW, the lowest first quarter average since Tasmania joined the NEM in 2005. The new mark was 1.5% down on the same period last year. Operational demand bottomed out on 21 January 2023, reaching a record low of 14,375 MW in the half-hour ending 12.30pm.
“Growing renewable output across the NEM meant that 12% of the time wholesale prices were negative or zero. Further, between 9.00 am and 5.00 pm, wholesale electricity prices were negative in South Australia and Victoria 60% and 55% of the time, respectively,” Westerman said.
The report also showed a record March quarter low for greenhouse gas emissions at 28.83 million tons, down 5.1% on a year earlier as electricity generation from coal and gas declined.

The project's first phase has a capacity of 1 GW and required an investment of CNY 5.11 billion. Construction of the facility started in November.
The plant is connected to the ultra-high voltage power line Ningxia-Hunan ±800 kV UHV DC. The CNY 100 billion line stretches from Ningxia Hui to Hunan province. It will pass through Ningxia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Chongqing, Hubei and Hunan provinces.
The 3 GW project is currently the world's second-largest PV plant under construction, following a 3.3 GW solar facility that state-owned China Huadian is currently building in Changdu, Sichuan province. It will require a total investment of around CNY 15.25 billion.
The government of Hunan said that the solar park is expected to produce 5.78 billion kWh per year upon full completion.
The world's largest operational PV plant is currently a 2.2 GW facility that Chinese state-owned utility Huanghe Hydropower Development put into operation in October 2020. This project is also connected to an ultra-high voltage power line that State Grid Corp is building in China.

The method is similar to phase change materials (PCMs), which absorb, store and release a large amount of latent heat over a specified temperature range, and are typically used for PV module cooling at the research level. The system is inexpensive and does not consume energy, and it has self-recovering properties, making it highly versatile.
“The proposed method has no energy consumption and consists of cheap materials, making it highly applicable,” the scientists claimed. “Moreover, it can be repeatedly utilized, owing to its self-recovering characteristics.”
The researchers describe the technique as an atmospheric water desorption-driven cooling system that uses Zeolite 13X, a commercially available alumino-silicate material, to desorb water molecules that produce a latent cooling effect. When heat is applied, water is desorbed from Zeolite 13X and dissolves ammonium nitrate (NxH4NO3) to induce endothermic reaction cooling, resulting in a reversible process that recovers itself at night.
The water desorption-driven endothermic reaction (WD-ER) cooling system can absorb heat from solar radiation and desorb the solvent, which generates secondary cold energy by dissolving the solute. The cooling effect is achieved because the water adsorption capacity of zeolite 13X is inversely proportional to temperature, and water can dissolve more ammonium nitrate at higher temperatures.
The Korean team attached the WD-ER system to the backside of a solar cell that is urethane waterproofed to protect it from moisture. They coated the cell with Zeolite 13X particles and a negligible amount of polyvinyl, then saturated these particles with water and added an NH4NO3 crystal layer to form a thin film.
The WD-ER system had an average effective heat transfer coefficient of 64.1 W/m2, and thermal imaging taken at 2 pm showed that the surface temperature of the PV cell with the WD-ER cooling unit was 39–43 C, which was significantly lower than that of natural air cooling (51–56 C). The average temperature of the PV cell with WD-ER was reduced by 14.9 C.
The researchers suggest that this novel cooling system may outperform other cooling methods reported in the literature, although they did not provide a detailed analysis of production costs or potential commercial applications.
They presented their findings in “Self-recovering passive cooling utilizing endothermic reaction of NH4NO3/H2O driven by water sorption for photovoltaic cell,” which was recently published in Nature Communications.

The fragile equilibrium holding M10 prices steady in preceding weeks finally showed signs of cracking, as wafer output outstrips demand growth slightly.
China is estimated to produce around 48 GW of wafers in April, a 7% increase from March. Industry players concurred that wafer production is expanding more quickly than anticipated, with some who had been expecting wafers to continue trading sideways switching to more bearish outlooks.

The slight dip could signal that wafer prices are in for a gradual slide downwards in the near term, following the footsteps of upstream polysilicon’s continual decline in the preceding weeks. Weakness in the wafer segment comes as China’s high-purity quartz (HPQ) imports arrive, suggesting wafer manufacturers should be able to ratchet up now to full capacity.
While the current HPQ shortage has eased, concerns about future shortages continue to affect the market. Given Sibelco’s plans to double HPQ production capacity at its Spruce Pine facility by 2025 and that Spruce Pine in North Carolina is the world’s single largest source of HPQ, wafer makers may have good news – albeit on the distant horizon.

However, until today, deploying V2G services at scale has proven complex, not least because of EV owners’ unwillingness to let go control of their vehicles.
To incorporate EVs with V2G capability into the frequency control, existing approaches have primarily focused on the State of Charge (SoC) level of batteries, which does not effectively distinguish between EVs with varying owner expectations. However, a higher level of EV owners’ satisfaction may increase their interest in providing these ancillary services in the future.
Now, researchers from the Griffith University, Queensland, Australia, and the Macquarie University, New South Wales, Australia are proposing a novel adaptive decentralized control scheme to regulate the contribution of EVs to primary frequency control in an islanded microgrid considering both operating limits and owner expectations.
For this purpose, different adaptive droop parameters are developed. Instead of using SoC to represent the functionality of an EV to participate in frequency regulations, the researchers have introduced Charge Capability of Battery (CCoB) and Discharge Capability of Battery (DCoB) indices to evaluate these capabilities in real-time.
“Using these indices, it is possible to evaluate the contribution of EVs not only based on SoC level but also according to the time that EV owners expect to spend at charging stations. Vehicles with the same SoC but different plug-in durations will be treated differently. The results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive control scheme offers both EV-side and microgrid-side benefits,” they write in their paper.
The proposed method provides the EV owner with a higher level of SoC during frequency control, which is subject to several uncertainties, and consequently leads to higher satisfaction among EV owners, the researchers find. With the help of the EV Owner Satisfaction (EOS) index, it is possible to evaluate charging methods, incentive programs, and other activities that may influence the participation of EVs in supporting the grid.
Finally, implementing this strategy is found to prevent ramping issues in cases where a large number of EVs with similar SoCs are ready to contribute, thus adversely affecting the microgrid stability.
The findings were discussed in “Adaptive control of V2Gs in islanded microgrids incorporating EV owner expectations,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.

German system integrator Badenova has inaugurated the first PV roof for cycle paths in Germany. The 287 kW installation is located in Freiburg, in the southern part of the country, and is based on 900 translucent glass-glass solar modules provided by German panel maker Solarwatt.
The modules in the series have a general technical approval from the German Institute for Building Technology (DIBt). They are therefore regarded as a regulated building product that can be used without restriction in the private and public sector. The solar modules can also be used for overhead and facade installations without individual checks and additional security measures.
The solar array is 300 m long and is located near the SC Freiburg football stadium, which is already equipped with a PV system that utilizes heterojunction modules supplied by Switzerland-based Meyer Burger.
Badenova's Badenova Wärme Plus subsidiary partnered with the city of Freiburg and the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE in the construction of the cycle path. Freiburg-based company Clickcon provided the mounting structures.
The energy generated by the facility – around 280 MWh per year – will be primarily used in the laboratories and buildings of Fraunhofer ISE. The Freiburg Institute is also the leaseholder and operator of the facility and will be responsible for monitoring.
“We have to rethink photovoltaics so that we can integrate further projects of this kind into the cityscape. This pilot project shows how urban spaces can be used twice,” said Heinz-Werner Hölscher, a Badenova board member.
