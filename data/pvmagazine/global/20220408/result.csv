The SOFC system can run on natural gas, biomethane, hydrogen or different blendings, with an electrical efficiency of more than 60% and an overall efficiency of more than 85%.
“Our SOFC system is primarily used to produce electrical energy but can also produce thermal energy at temperature levels that can be used for heating or cooling,” Marcus Spickermann, senior vice president of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) at Bosch, told pv magazine. “We are running several pilot projects at the moment, and we are preparing for the market entry in 2024, when we will start with an annual production volume of 200 MW per year.”
The current prototype machines have a target power output of 10 kW electricity supply. They also produce up to 3 kW of thermal energy.
“We are currently planning to increase the capacity of the system, as our plan is to offer the device mainly in the commercial and industrial segment,” Spickermann said.
The modular SOFC units can be combined to a cascade or cluster that forms a decentral energy supply system and are designed as connected devices that are part of the Internet of Things. In the future, it will be possible to connect SOFC clusters to virtual power plants that reach high power capacities in the megawatt range.
“When these machines are linked together, and the power grid fails, their resilience has a value that many investors may be happy to recognize,” Wayne-Daniel Kern, vice president of SOFC at Bosch, told pv magazine.
The fuel cell unit also produces thermal energy at temperature levels that can be used for heating or cooling.
“The heat coming out of the system has a temperature of around 200 Celsius degrees, an optimal level to reutilize it to heat buildings or reconvert it into cooling for use cases in data centers,” Kern said. “This heat can be an efficient add-on supply to a building's existing heat supply system. The machines are primarily intended at producing electricity, but making use of the heat supply helps reduce the costs of ownership.”
When commercial production is launched, the product may have a payback time of between five and six years, so by that time it will become very attractive, said Kern. Bosch aims to produce the fuel cell units on a large scale.
“We are not targeting a niche market, we are a mass manufacturing company,” Kern said. “We know how to industrialize and produce thousands of machines.”
In Germany, Bosch already operates around 50 SOFC pilot installations at its own sites in Bamberg, Homburg, Renningen, Salzgitter, Schwieberdingen, Stuttgart-Feuerbach, and Wernau. Its first pilots are running at customer locations such as Stadtwerke Bamberg. This SOFC unit supplies power to the surrounding area and the heat is used at a nearby bakery.
In preparation of the production ramp-up in 2024, further pilot projects will follow in order to prove the capabilities of the SOFC units. The company will develop a series of products that meet custome requirements in different use scenarios such as buildings, industrial applications, distributed energy supply systems (microgrids), and data centers.

It added that it is about to assemble a 20 MW electrolyzer at its PtX HySynergy facility. The facility will be scaled to 300 MW in 2025 and 1 GW in 2030.
The European Hydrogen Backbone (EHB) initiative has accelerated its program to produce 20.6 million tons of renewable and low-carbon European hydrogen from 2025 to 2030. “The accelerated EHB vision shows that by 2030, five pan-European hydrogen supply and import corridors with almost 28,000 km of initial pipelines could emerge, connecting industrial clusters, ports, and hydrogen valleys to regions of abundant demand,” said the EHB. The group of 31 European gas transmission system operators also proposes a hydrogen network of around 53,000 km by 2040, which would require an investment of €80 billion ($86.8 billion) to €143 billion by using 60% repurposed natural gas pipelines and 40% new pipelines, including subsea links. “Transporting hydrogen over 1,000 km along the proposed onshore backbone would on average cost €0.11 to €0.21 per kilogram of hydrogen, making the EHB the most cost-effective option for large-scale, long-distance hydrogen transport. In case hydrogen is transported exclusively via subsea pipelines, the cost would be €0.17 to €0.32 per kilogram of hydrogen per 1,000 km transported.”
The UK government published its hydrogen investor roadmap, with plans to double its target to up to 10 GW of low-carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030. At least half of this will be from electrolytic hydrogen. The government has launched a GBP 240 million ($311.8 million) to support the production of hydrogen, and a further GBP 5 million toward research into carbon capture. “Increasing our production ambition could mobilize over GBP 9 billion of private investment (an increase of GBP 5 billion relative to 5 GW ambition),” said the government. It also published a report on the potential hydrogen emissions in different sectors across a future hydrogen value-chain. “There is an increasing body of evidence that leakage of hydrogen to the atmosphere will have an indirect warming effect on the climate and so should be minimized,” it said. 
Impact Coatings, a physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) coating specialist in Sweden, has announced the opening of a subsidiary in Shanghai. “The objective of the opening is to distribute Impact Coatings' market-leading expertise in PVD coatings for hydrogen solutions and to improve the availability of Coating Services solutions to Chinese customers in the hydrogen value chain,” the company said on Thursday. Impact Coatings is already present in the Chinese fuel cell market. 
Green Hydrogen Systems has signed an agreement with Gaznat to deliver electrolysis equipment for its Innovation Lab in Switzerland. The order includes the supply of an electrolyzer with a capacity of 0.5 MW. “When fully operational, the ordered electrolyzer will have the capacity to supply approximately 195 kg of green hydrogen per day. The hydrogen will be used to produce synthetic methane with a new and innovative methanation reactor developed by Gaznat, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne nd GRZ Technologies. The synthetic methane will be injected into the distribution grid covering the region of Chablais in Switzerland,” said Denmark-based Green Hydrogen Systems, which is a supplier of pressurized alkaline electrolyzers.
PKN Orlen will spend PLN 7.4bn (€1.6 billion) by 2030 on low- and zero-carbon hydrogen development projects based on renewable energy sources and municipal waste conversion technology. “As a result, ten hydrogen hubs will be developed by the end of the decade, with motorists in Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia provided with access to a network of over 100 hydrogen refuelling stations,” said the Polish state oil refiner and petrol retailer.
The Ontario government in Canada has released a low-carbon hydrogen strategy to accelerate the development of the low-carbon hydrogen economy. “As part of this strategy, the government is supporting a proposal from Atura Power, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ontario Power Generation, to build, own and operate the province's largest low-carbon hydrogen production facility in Niagara Falls. This project alone would expand the province's hydrogen production capacity eightfold,” the government wrote on Thursday. The proposed facility would be a source of low-carbon hydrogen with a 20-megawatt (MW) electrolyzer.
Next Hydrogen Solutions, an Ontario-based manufacturer of electrolyzers, has signed a deal with Black & Veatch to offer a complete and integrated solution to produce large-scale green hydrogen for industrial and transportation customers. Under the non-exclusive agreement, Next Hydrogen and Black & Veatch will develop a large-scale, multi-megawatt green hydrogen solution and identify additional collaboration opportunities.
E.ON has teamed up with Belgium-based Tree Energy Solutions (TES) to import green hydrogen at scale into Germany. The tie-up follows its deal with Australia-based Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) for up to 5 million tons per year of green hydrogen to Europe by 2030. “TES is developing a green energy hub in the German port of Wilhelmshaven. The energy hub will feature a receiving terminal, storage facilities and a clean, zero-emissions oxy-fuel combustion power plant,” E.ON said. The German company plans “to build the Wilhelmshaven location into a hub for international hydrogen trading and upgrade the infrastructure accordingly,” said Paul van Poecke, managing director of TES.
MPreis has commissioned an electrolysis plant in Völs, near Innsbruck, Austria. “The plant will initially prove that the electrolyzer can be used to compensate for fluctuations in the Austrian electricity grid. Soon, the Therese Mölk bakery will also use hydrogen to heat baking ovens. We also want to put the first fuel cell trucks on the road as early as May 2022,” said the Austrian food retailer. The first three vehicles, reportedly the first of their kind in Austria, will be refueled at the company's own H2 filling station.
HydroGraph Clean Power, a spinoff of Kansas State University, is commercializing a detonation method to create graphene and hydrogen-rich syngas, based on channeling acetylene and oxygen in a small chamber to create a controlled detonation. “The research not only led to a pilot-scale graphene production device, but another discovery: an environmentally benign, inexpensive method to make hydrogen,” said Kansas State University. HydroGraph Clean Power recently went public on the Canadian Securities Exchange.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/08/the-mobility-revolution-nissan-moves-forward-with-in-house-all-solid-state-battery-production/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"APRIL 8, 2022",The mobility rEVolution: Nissan moves forward with in-house all-solid-state battery production,"Often touted as a potential game-changing technology for accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), all-solid-state batteries boast an energy density approximately twice that of conventional lithium-ion batteries, significantly shorter charging times, and lower cost thanks to less expensive raw materials. While many Western legacy carmakers continue to invest heavily and forge partnerships with solid-state battery specialists, like QuantumScape or Prologium, to develop vehicles powered by this type of technology, Nissan has made key progress towards producing its own version of solid-state batteries for EVs. To keep all production in-house, the Japanese carmaker has unveiled its prototype manufacturing facility for laminated all-solid-state battery cells at its research center in Kanagawa Prefecture. Under its Ambition 2030 vision, Nissan aims to launch an EV with all-solid-state batteries developed in-house by fiscal 2028. Its plan is to establish a pilot production line at its Yokohama Plant in fiscal 2024 to study materials, design, and manufacturing processes for prototype production. The maker of the world’s first mass-market EV, the Leaf, believes the cost of all-solid-state batteries can be reduced to US$75 per kWh in fiscal 2028 and to $65 per kWh thereafter, placing EVs at the same cost level as gasoline-powered vehicles.
When it comes to affordability of EVs, Japanese carmaker Honda and U.S. corporation General Motors have come together to “put people all over the world into EVs faster than either company could achieve on its own.” The two car manufacturers will codevelop a series of affordable EVs based on a new architecture using GM’s Ultium battery technology. The tie-up is expected to produce millions of EVs priced below $30,000, including popular compact crossover vehicles, beginning in 2027. GM is already working to accelerate new technologies like lithium-metal, silicon, and solid-state batteries, along with production methods that can be used to improve and update battery cell manufacturing processes. Meanwhile, Honda has established a demonstration line in Japan for all-solid-state batteries, which it sees as the core element of future EVs, and is making further progress toward mass-production. The two carmakers will also discuss future EV battery technology collaboration opportunities, to further drive down the cost of electrification, improve performance, and drive sustainability for future vehicles. “GM and Honda will share our best technology, design and manufacturing strategies to deliver affordable and desirable EVs on a global scale, including our key markets in North America, South America and China,” said Mary Barra, GM CEO. “This is a key step to deliver on our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality in our global products and operations by 2040 and eliminate tailpipe emissions from light-duty vehicles in the U.S. by 2035.”
Earlier this week, Barra herself, alongside Tesla’s Elon Musk and other automotive industry representatives, met with Biden administration senior officials to discuss EVs and charging infrastructure. The virtual meeting held on Wednesday yielded an agreement that the US EV charging network should offer an interoperable experience based on any car model. CEOs of Ford, Stellantis, Nissan Americas, Lucid and others also attended the meeting which discussed the US funding to “create a national network of 500,000 chargers.” Biden wants at least 50% of new vehicles by 2030 to be EVs or plug-in hybrids. In February, the administration rolled out a plan to award nearly $5 billion over five years to build thousands of EV charging stations every 50 miles (80km) along interstate highways, as part of a $7.5 billion funding package approved by Congress last year.
In Europe, EV batteries made by Mercedes-Benz will be given a new life in stationary energy storage systems. Swedish startup BatteryLoop said it will use batteries supplied by the German carmaker’s Mercedes-Benz Energy business line for its range of scalable, circular energy storage solutions, called BLESS. This could enable BatteryLoop to roll out 40MWh of energy storage systems within the next 18 months. The first project using Mercedes-Benz Energy’s modules will be a 2MWh system that the start-up, part of Swedish recycling company Stena Metall Group, will install in its home country. BatteryLoop said it will secure “high volumes” of batteries, both new and second life, through the deal. “With second-use batteries and a power-optimizing system we can also, based on the Swedish environmental research institute lifecycle analysis, save 1,000-tonnes CO2 emissions per 3MW energy storage system from the production and at the same time generate the same benefits for the grid,” BatteryLoop CEO Rasmus Bergström said, adding that such systems can generate significant revenues for customers of between SEK7 million (US$0.75 million) to SEK10 million per year.
This week, Mercedes-Benz revealed that its EV sales are going through the roof. The carmaker said the sales of its EVs and plug-in hybrids has increased by 37% to 67,800 units in the first quarter of 2022. Sales of the fully electric EQ models more than tripled to 21,900 (up by 210% compared to Q1 2021). “Ongoing strong demand for our electrified vehicles in all segments and markets proves that customers desire our EVs und plug-in hybrids. And with the launch of our new EQS SUV on April 19th we further accelerate our transformation,” said Britta Seeger, Member of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG responsible for Mercedes-Benz Cars Sales. Thereby, the Stuttgart-headquartered luxury carmaker seems to have outperformed its Munich-based rival BMW, which saw an increase of 149.2% in global sales of its all-electric BMW and Mini vehicles. However, BMW delivered a greater number of all-electric vehicles – a total of 35,289 between January and March.

Among these approaches are inverted perovskite devices, where the negative electrode is placed at the top layer of the cell, and the positive at the bottom – as opposed to the typical device where this is reversed. This approach has shown strong stability performance and could potentially open up new manufacturing techniques for exploration, but it also comes with challenges. “It’s hard to get good contact between the perovskite layer and the top electrode,” says Hao Chen, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Toronto. “To solve this, researchers typically insert a passivation layer made of organic molecules. That works really well in the traditional orientation, because ‘holes’ can go right through this passivation layer. But electrons are blocked by this layer, so when you invert the cell it becomes a big problem.”
Overcoming this challenge to the electron flow was the goal of Chen and his colleagues, who worked with extremely thin “two-dimensional” perovskite layers, which afforded them better control over the material’s “quantum mechanics” characteristics – those that differ from the material’s overall behavior when observed at a larger scale, such as the movement of electrons or absorption of particular wavelengths of light. By slightly increasing the thickness of the layer, from one to three crystals in height, more electrons were able to escape through the passivation layer and into a circuit.
The research is described in full in a paper published in Nature Photonics. Cells fabricated by the group achieved 23.9% efficiency, which did not fade after the devices were left unencapsulated in ambient conditions for 1,000 hours. The cells were also encapsulated and subjected to harsher accelerated aging tests, where they retained 92% of initial performance after 500 hours.
The group says that its future work will focus on improving this stability performance, as well as scaling up the approach to larger area devices than the 5mm² used for these cells. “We compare our prototypes to both traditional and inverted perovskite solar cells that have been recently published in the scientific literature,” said researcher Sam Teale. “The combination of high stability and high efficiency we achieved really stands out. We should also keep in mind that perovskite technology is only a couple of decades old, whereas silicon has been worked on for 70 years. There are a lot of improvements still to come.”

The company wants to invest CNY20.6 billion (US$3.27 billion) in the new facility. The project is currently awaiting approval from the company's board of directors and relevant regional authorities.
PV wafer producer Shuangliang Eco-Energy announced this week it wants to enter the solar module business by setting up 20 GW of capacity. The company plans to invest CNY 5 billion ($794 million) in the new facility, which will be located at an unspecified location in Inner Mongolia. The first phase of the project should have a capacity of 5 GW and is set to be finalized by the end of 2023.
PV panel manufacturer Longi said this week it received an official notification from the provincial office of the National Development and Reform Committee (NDRC) of Yunnan Province, where some of its manufacturing facilities are located, that it will not be granted preferential electricity rates, as agreed with the provincial government before the construction of the factories. According to the notification, all the electricity Longi consumed in this province since Sept. 1, 2021, must be priced through electricity market-based transactions and directly settled with the local power grid company. Longi said the cancellation of the preferential electricity rates will increase production costs and negatively impact its profit margin.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/08/greece-installed-792-mw-of-pv-in-2021/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,GREECE,WESTERN EUROPE",ILIAS TSAGAS,"APRIL 8, 2022",Greece installed 792 MW of PV in 2021,"Just this week, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis inaugurated a 204 MW solar array – the country’s largest PV project. However, he also revealed the bad news that the country will not phase out coal until 2028.
The Renewable Energy Sources Operator and Guarantees of Origin (Dapeep) has published its statistics for 2021. However, its report did not cover net-metering systems, and it only counts solar arrays connected to the grid, but not those that are installed and waiting for a connection.
The Hellenic Association of Photovoltaic Companies (Helapco) told pv magazine that Greece installed 792 MW of new PV capacity last year. This capacity includes 384 MW of solar connected to the grid, 38 MW of net-metered systems also connected to the mainland or island grids, and 370 MW of new PV projects that were installed by the end of the year, but will only be electrified in 2022.
This problem is not new. It also happened in 2020 and pv magazine reported on it in detail. The problem concerns sub-500 kW solar projects that are operated with stable feed-in tariffs (FITs). These tariffs were lost if projects failed to connect to the grid on time. But many projects were ready to connect, and the local electricity network was often slow to process the rush of connection applications, resulting in some projects potentially losing the stable FITs.
The government therefore allowed such projects to retain the FITs as long as they were fully installed within the deadlines. Electrification can take place later.
In 2020, Greece had installed 913 MW of new PV. At present, sub-500 kW solar projects do not need to participate in Greece’s competitive tenders and can claim a stable tariff of €65.74 ($71.43)/MWh, as long as the projects are installed by the end of August 2022.
Dapeep said that by the end of 2021, Greece had connected 3.66 GW of ground-mounted solar farms and 375 MW of rooftop PV to the grid. The figures exclude net-metered arrays. Dapeep also said that Greece’s renewables fund had a surplus of about €250 million surplus in December 2021. It expects this surplus to reach about €2.45 billion in December 2022.
According to Helapco data, Greece’s cumulative net-metering capacity stands at 89 MW. Rather impressive is the fact that 98% of the net-metering installations last year were commercial systems.
The government introduced a number of policy changes a few months ago to support the net-metering sector. The success of these measures will only show up in this year’s installations, however.
Mitsotakis inaugurated the country's largest PV project this week  in Kozani, a coal mining town. The 204 MW project was secured in country’s first joint competitive tender for solar and wind energy in April 2019.
Germany’s Juwi Group’s won a €0.05446/kWh premium tariff for the first 139.24 MW portion of the project. Two smaller project chunks (27.68 MW and 37.37 MW) were awarded a €0.06472 per kWh premium tariff.
The 204 MW project was later sold to Athens-based Hellenic Petroleum and is part of Greece’s goal to install 3 GW of solar power in the country’s lignite regions. Juwi said it is Europe's largest bifacial solar park and the largest utility-scale solar farm in southeastern Europe.
Delayed coal phase-out
However, Mitsotakis also bore bad news this week. He said that Greece will postpone its coal phase-out date to 2028, on top of plans to expand its lignite mining output by 50%. The prime minister claimed that the moves do not represent an energy policy shift and insisted that Greece remains committed to the green energy transition.
This latest embrace of lignite is a reaction to the war in Ukraine and efforts to reduce reliance on Russian gas. Mitsotakis has said that the decision is a temporary measure, with no impact on Greece’s climate emissions targets and net-zero goal.
pv magazine reported on Greece’s coal phase-out coal in December. The government said in September 2019 that the country would phase coal out of its electricity mix by 2028. However, a number of developments later brought this date down to 2025. This week, the lignite phase-out date was again pushed back to 2028.
A number of factors will affect Greece’s coal phase-out date. They include gas prices, carbon emissions prices, the speed at which Greece develops new renewables capacity, new electricity interconnections, and the European Union’s policy mandates.
Greece’s ministry of the environment and energy has said that a new bill is ready for faster licensing of renewable energy and policies for energy storage. The new bill will be Greece’s second serious overhaul of its energy policy since its first policy package in 2020. But the clock is ticking. There is not much time left.

The factory now has a capacity of 500 MW. It will produce new panels based on multi-busbar, half-cell, and 1/3 cut cell technologies, with power outputs ranging from 450 W to 670 W.
“With this new capacity, the company strengthens and maintains its leadership in the national market, not only in terms of volume produced, but also in cutting-edge technology, characterizing itself as one of the companies that invest the most in new processes and equipment in the sector,” BYD said referring to the new production line, which is expected to start commercial operations on April 25.
Adalberto Maluf, director of marketing and sustainability at BYD Brasil, hailed the launch of the new production line.
“In addition to representing the largest factory in operation and occupying the position of largest manufacturer in the country, the facility has already produced more than 1.6 million modules in the last five years, bringing great independence and economy to the market, as a source of clean and renewable energy,” said Maluf.
The factory opened in 2017 with an annual capacity of 200 MW, with the support of Apex-Brasil, the Brazilian government's trade and investment promotion agency. Solar projects that feature Brazilian-made components can obtain financing from the Brazilian Development Bank and Banco do Nordeste.
Chinese-Canadian PV module manufacturer Canadian Solar also operates a solar module factory near Sao Paulo with an annual production capacity of 380 MW.

The device uses propane as a refrigerant, which allows for high energy efficiency, while keeping carbon dioxide emissions to almost zero.
“Our heat pump can heat homes completely environmentally friendly, without emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In addition, its high-efficiency energy allows it to be classified as renewable energy, by pumping energy from the environment”, said researcher José Gonzalvez.
According to the scientists, the heat pump is able to generate domestic water at up to 75 C, a value which they describe as impossible to achieve for conventional heat pumps.
“In addition, it can be installed not only in new buildings but also to replace gas boilers in existing buildings. It also allows applying the anti-legionella treatment without the need for external support,” Gonzalvez explained.
The heat pump purportedly has a high efficiency of A+++ and can produce 6.49 kWh of heat for each kilowatt-hour of power it consumes. It is also capable of producing 4.43 kWh of domestic hot water for each kilowatt-hour of consumed power.
“In the technological developments that have been carried out to date, it has been possible to achieve energy efficiencies similar to those achieved with our refrigerants, with a high atmospheric heating power,” said Gonzalvez. “To do this, we performed an analysis on the best configuration of the vapor compression cycle adapted to the refrigerant used – propane – thus minimizing the amount used and optimizing the control parameters of the equipment.”
The researchers did not provide any additional technical details about the device.
According to Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE, the Polytechnic University of Valencia is currently developing a tool for predictive simulations with its IMST-Art software for the simulation and design of refrigeration equipment. The German institute is also developing refrigeration circuits for heat pumps, which will be able to operate as efficiently as possible with low amounts of climate-friendly refrigerant propane.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/08/lithium-ion-storage-a-much-needed-development-to-support-the-rise-of-renewables-in-the-coming-decades/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,EUROPE",,"APRIL 8, 2022",Lithium-ion storage: A much-needed development to support the rise of renewables in the coming decades,"Since Belfort, the invasion of Ukraine and the succession of international sanctions that have descended upon Russia have only accentuated the need to work towards greater energy autonomy and sobriety.  On Mar. 8, the European Commission unveiled its plan, labeled REPowerEU, to halt Russian oil and gas imports. One of the four main axes of this plan is based, once again, on the development of renewable energies.
The inevitable penetration of intermittent renewable energies into the European electricity mix constitutes an ever-growing challenge to the stability of the grid. In Europe, the development of renewable energies is taking place much more rapidly than the growth of electricity consumption – in France, the latter has not increased since the years 2005-2010. The emergence of renewables penalizes twice over conventional controllable electricity sources (such as gas, oil, and coal, called as such due to their high reactivity – nuclear power is also controllable but over longer time periods due to strong inertia):
The development of wind and solar on the grid was therefore primarily at the expense of well-established controllable energies. European grid operators, responsible for ensuring the supply-demand balance at all times throughout the year, are now juggling between (i) on the one hand, variable electricity consumption punctuated by peaks in electricity consumption during heat waves and extreme winter colds and (ii) on the other, increasingly intermittent means of electricity production, less and less predictable in electricity output.

In the long run, innovation will be needed to equip electricity grids with flexible resources to control and modulate this growing intermittent electricity production. Tasking controllable power plants to ensure grid stability, as is done today, may not seem like the best option: many complementary alternative solutions seem more suitable to perform grid flexibility services.
Changes in electricity consumption behaviors with cut-offs, energy efficiency, and sobriety stand as the obvious primary solution; but technological innovation with electricity storage (lithium-ion batteries, hydrogen power-to-gas etc.) should be another. Every given storage technology has its own use case, mainly defined by its activation speed as well as its charging (or discharging) time.
Among all options, lithium-ion storage stands out as the most mature technology to meet the grid’s rapid short-lived imbalances. These assets can be activated in a few seconds by the grid operator but are limited by their charging time, most often of an hour or two (and up to four hours). They can therefore respond very quickly to these imbalances, both upwards and downwards in frequency, by temporarily storing or injecting electricity. However, the relatively short discharging time of lithium-ion batteries makes them unsuitable for responding to imbalances over long periods of time, such as seasonal imbalances, whereas other technologies such as Pumped Energy Transfer Stations (PETS) or hydrogen will be more suitable.
In France, the development of these new flexibility resources is supported by the opening of new markets to remunerate their services. The long-term intraday electricity price forecasts today make it unlikely that lithium-ion assets will solely be profitable on the basis of a buy-sell arbitrage strategy on the spot market. In such a strategy, the asset buys and stores electricity when the spot price is low – in the middle of the day when the sun is in full swing for instance – to sell and inject it later into the network when the spot price rises, as in the evening after the return from work.

In France, two alternative markets allow for better profitability for storage assets: the capacity market and the frequency regulation market. At any point in time, a storage asset can either perform arbitrage on the spot market or operate on either one of these markets – whatever is more profitable for the battery.

Beyond these existing markets, the trend is towards the multiplication of remuneration sources for storage assets in France. The upcoming European opening of the secondary reserve/aFRR to this asset class (the PICASSO project), RTE’s experimental flexibility tenders under development as well as ENEDIS’s ongoing territorial tenders are good examples. Interestingly, the latter two aim at providing a local solution to decongest grid inflexibility nodes (although the applicability of ENEDIS’s tenders to lithium-ion storage assets remains uncertain at this stage).
These new markets remain very volatile and difficult to read for a long-term infrastructure asset class. Unlike renewable electricity projects that are remunerated via a power purchase agreement, often at a pre-agreed fixed price, storage assets in France are subject to significant market risks: the pricing of flexibility services systematically stems from a supply-demand balance rationale. Whether through operating on the spot markets or through participating in recurring tenders, the different sources of turnover of these assets are, in essence, volatile and difficult to predict in the long run.
This volatility greatly stifled the financialization of this asset class by the French energy transition long-term lenders, cooled down by these significant market risks. In 2019, RTE brought a first solution to the issue with its first long-term tenders (AOLT). These tenders offer predictability on the capacity market by guaranteeing a fixed price for seven years to the awarded projects. The introduction of these new tenders only partially met the lenders' need for predictability, despite being a step in the right direction. The capacity market (on which the AOLT provides seven-year visibility) rarely exceeds 25% of the total turnover base of lithium-ion storage assets.

Developers who want to quickly position themselves in the lithium-ion flexibility market are therefore forced to make strong choices:
The need for flexibility on the grid constitutes a real problem today with multiple answers. Among them, lithium-ion batteries appear the best suited to ensure the structural stability of the grid for short-term imbalances. The take-off of the French lithium-ion sector, which has been anticipated for some years now, seems to be slowed down by the lack of visibility on the profitability of the various flexibility markets. With (i) the multiplication of the number of projects and actors involved and (ii) the maturation of the various flexibility markets, the lithium-ion sector should continue to develop and structure itself so as to offer a suitable framework for third-party financiers. Interests look aligned between all parties: developers and lenders would find a relay for growth, while the grid operator would reduce its balancing costs.

Portugal awarded 183 MW of renewables capacity in an auction for floating PV projects this week. Around 56% of the capacity was awarded under the contract-for-difference regime (103 MW), and the rest under the National Electricity System Compensation scheme (80 MW).
In a statement, the Portuguese Ministry of the Environment and Climate Action states that it expects an average price of electricity of €0.041025 ($0.045)/kWh from the auction.
There were two lots with fixed prices in the auction. One lot concluded with a price of €0.04103/kWh and another at the lowest rate in the world, with a value of €-0.0413/kWh – equivalent to a 110% discount on the ceiling price initially set by the government. This bid was submitted by EDP Renewables (EDPR), the renewable energy unit of Energias de Portugal (EDP), whose largest shareholder is state-owned China Three Gorges.
Most of the remaining lots were awarded under the National Electricity System Compensation, in which a weighted average contribution of approximately €47,400 per MW/year was achieved. This remuneration offers a compensation expressed in euros per megawatt per year that will be paid to the network operator for grid-connection rights.
In addition to EDPR, Endesa Portugal – the Portuguese unit of Spanish energy company Endesa – reported on Monday that it won lot four, the third-largest in the tender. The project in Alto Rabagão, Vila Real, will have to wait until 2023 to start operating. It is a 42.5 MW floating solar power plant that will be bundled in a project with 48 MW of wind power and 16 MWh of battery storage.
Portugal-based Finerge has won lots five, six and seven, which correspond to the Paradela (13 MW), Salamonde (8 MW), and Vilar-Tabuaço (17 MW) reservoirs, respectively. Lot seven, from Tabuaço, was the most disputed, with 24 rounds. It was also the last to be completed in the entire auction. Finerge told pv magazine the prices of each lot were €4k/MW/year for lot five, €8k/MW/year for lot six, and €103 k/MW/year for lot seven, all for periods of 15 years.
“Since only six lots were actually disputed (because lot two has not yet been awarded), Finerge won 50% of the lots, the total of those that were proposed,” a spokesperson for the company explained.
Finerge currently has 68 wind farms and 17 solar plants in operation. It has nearly 1 GW under development, between Portugal and Spain, in addition to 38 MW of the new floating solar plants.
France's Voltalia also won one of the lots in the tender. The Cabril project, in Sertã, will have an installed capacity of between 33 MW and 40 MW, depending on the final optimization of the project. It is expected to be operational no later than 2026.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/08/pure-solid-state-batteries-from-switzerland/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SWITZERLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 8, 2022",Pure solid state batteries from Switzerland,"Swiss startup Swiss Clean Battery (SCB) AG said this week that it will build a gigafactory to produce pure solid-state batteries at its headquarters in Teufen, Switzerland.
“With production scaling from 1.2 GWh to 7.6 GWH, SCB AG will serve both the Swiss domestic and international markets with sustainable battery storage from 2024,” the company said. “In the first production phase of 1.2 GWH, SCB AG is planning sales of CHF 318 million ($340 million). For this, CHF 246 million investment volume in the machinery is planned.  In this first stage, SCB AG employs 181 people. A production area of 20,000 m2 will be built in order to manufacture 7.2 million battery cells per year.”
COO Thomas Lützenrath said the batteries will have several competitive advantages compared to conventional lithium-ion storage.
“Conventional lithium-ion batteries age because a covering layer is formed on their anodes through charging and discharging. This grows over time and with each use, even faster the more intensively the battery is used. This growth of the top layer consumes capacity and increases the internal resistance, and the performance of the battery decreases,” he told pv magazine.
By contrast, a very thin top layer in the pure solid-state batteries is formed during the first charge, said Lützenrath.
“After that, it doesn't grow anymore,” he explained. “By using our protected electrolyte made of a solid ion conductor, the internal resistance and capacity will remain virtually constant over the service life. No matter how much the battery is used.”
The battery technology does not require any critical raw materials such as cobalt or gold.
“As a result of this and the extreme service life, the environmental balance can be improved by more than half compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries,” Lützenrath explained. “The predecessor technology of the solid-state battery – still on a liquid basis – has already completed more than 50,000 charging cycles in practical use in the USA in a battery storage system for buffering the power grid. This liquid predecessor technology has already been produced on an industrial scale.”
The core of the storage technology is the solid ion conductor, which replaces conventional liquid electrolytes.
“A central, technical problem is to bring the fixed ion conductor in the battery cells into a stable connection with the electrodes. After more than 30 years of basic research, it has now been possible to solve this problem,” said Lützenrath.
He said many research projects are based on a modular design, which means that individual parts are combined outside the cell and inserted into the housing, with technical problems occurring during the transition of ions at the material boundaries, between the anode, the solid ion conductor and cathode.
“Our solid-state battery is different, as the fixed ion conductor is formed in the battery cell itself, similar to a multi-component adhesive, like two components glue,” said Lützenrath, without providing more technical details.
SCB said that its market value currently stands at CHF 13 billion and that it will launch an initial public offering on the Zurich stock exchange in October.
“In the final phase, SCB AG is to produce 7.6 GWH, with an investment sum of CHF 775 million and a turnover of over CHF 2 billion. Approximately 100,000 m2 of production area will be built for this purpose. At this stage of expansion, SCB AG will produce nearly 48 million battery cells per year with 1,061 employees.  The company will then be worth CHF 8.6 billion,” said the company.
Solid-state batteries could be the most promising of the many different routes pursued by researchers to improve on today’s battery energy storage technologies. And many in the industry are optimistic that the approach will eventually bring about a “step change” in battery technology, greatly improving the capacity, lifetime and safety of lithium-ion batteries.
Swapping out the current generation of liquid/gel electrolytes with a solid material could eliminate any fire risk from the battery, as well as improving energy-to-weight ratios and removing the additional “energy redundant” packaging materials required to hold a liquid, among several other advantages.
The key development though is that the solid electrolyte would allow for the use of a lithium-metal anode, with far higher energy density than the graphite that’s commonly used today. Though there is research into integrating lithium-metal with liquid or semisolid electrolytes, all-solid-state is viewed by many as the best approach.

According to Ember, an independent think tank, if wind and solar keep up a 20% compounding growth rate over the next 10 years, the global power sector has a chance of meeting the decarbonization goals that are needed to keep the world’s temperature increase at or below 1.5 C.
If solar electricity generation keeps up the year over year growth rates of the last ten years – 33% – for another 10 years, then solar will without a doubt be pulling its weight in mitigating CO2 emissions. The report suggests that solar “only” needs to grow at 24% over the next decade to meet its goals.
The analysis found that solar electricity generation rose by greater than 23% last year, and that wind grew by 14%. The two sources officially surpassed 10% of global electricity generation last year, and when combined with other clean electricity sources (nuclear and hydro being the other two largest), they hit 38%. Combined, this means they passed the world’s largest electricity generation source – coal – at 36%.
Globally, 50 countries now meet 10% or more of their electricity demand with wind and solar. Three countries dramatically surpassed that target: Denmark, Luxembourg, and Uruguay produced 52%, 42%, and 47% of their respective electricity supply using only wind and solar power. The current global leaders in solar power are Yemen, at ~15%, Chile at 13%, and Australia at 12%.
But the news isn’t all roses. Coal consumption ramped up last year as a result of China’s continued growth, as well as the recovery of the global economy and related electricity demands. In absolute terms, the global electricity demand increases of 2021 were the largest ever observed. Unfortunately, growth in wind and solar — also the largest ever observed — supplied only 29% of that increased demand for electricity.
In a related document, Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a report stating that wind and solar power represent our two least expensive tools for lowering CO2.
The graph from the IPCC report (above) shows that by 2030, solar and wind are each expected to mitigate roughly four gigatons per year of CO2 emissions, with an upper limit as high as six gigatons each, per year. The carbon savings from either one of these clean energy sources is expected to be on par with the emissions that would be saved by ceasing the destruction of forestland. The blue on the bar graph suggests that at least four gigatons of these global CO2 reductions (wind and solar combined) will cost less than we’re paying for energy today.
Within that report is a combination graph that should look familiar to readers of pv magazine: the growth rates of various clean technologies, along with their associated cost decreases.

Next Automation's hydraulically operated cleaning machine, SolarTrack MK1, provides better control with optimal water usage.
“Currently, manual cleaning requires water tankers and laborers to clean panels on a routine basis,” Kiran Kumar, the founder of Next Automation, told pv magazine. “With an eight-hour working shift, it takes a month to clean a 15 MW plant with six laborers and 2,25,000 liters of water. SolarTrack MK1 takes just five days to clean the entire plant with a maximum of 70,000 to 90,000 liters of water.”
The overall cleaning system contains three parts: brush, water and hydraulic system.
The water system contains a water storage tank to carry water with the tractor itself.  During the cleaning operation, a sprinkler system placed near the rotating brush sprays water on the surface of the panels. The wet cleaning gives more efficient cleaning than dry cleaning methods because the sticky particles and bird droppings cannot be cleaned with the dry cleaning methods.
The hydraulic system helps control the cleaning system’s swivel mechanism, brush rotation, and cleaning height adjustment for various inclinations of panels.
“For solar park operators, dust and bird droppings on the panels are the biggest enemy as it drastically reduces the solar panels’ efficiency. Our equipment can clean bird droppings and sticky particles, which is usually not possible with conventional panel cleaning robots. Wet cleaning is possible with the water system mounted itself,” said Kumar.
As regards ease of use, SolarTrack MK1 can easily cover the entire panel length in a single swipe. The tool provides more accurate cleaning and requires no external power source or batteries. The SolarTrack cleaning system is externally mounted on tractors and can be customized. After use, it can be folded up and safely transported.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/08/fortescue-buys-cattle-stations-for-5-gw-renewable-energy-hub/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 8, 2022",Fortescue buys cattle stations for 5GW renewable energy hub,"From pv magazine Australia
According to the ABC, Australian mining magnate Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest has continued his land grab in Western Australia to generate renewable energy with the purchase of three cattle stations in the state’s northwest. 
Forrest’s Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) purchased Emu Creek Station in the Pilbara and Ella Valla Station in the Gascoyne for undisclosed sums. The sale of Yalbago Station (also in the Gascoyne) has yet to be finalized. The stations will continue to run cattle, but their primary function will be to generate renewable energy to power Fortescue Metals Group’s (FMG) Eliwana iron ore mine 170 miles west of Emu Creek Station. 
According to the environmental documents FFI lodged with the WA Environmental Protection Authority for its Uaroo Renewable Energy Hub in the Pilbara region, the hub will consist of 3.33 GW of solar and 2.04 GW of wind spread across 10,000 hectares. In addition, the hub would also include a 9.1 GWh battery.  
The hub is set to utilise a 220 kV transmission line that would connect Uaroo’s main substation to a substation at the Eliwana mine site, though this transmission line was not included in the EPA submission. 
“What the greater Perth area would be using on a really, really hot day with all of the air conditioning on would be something like the energy that we’d be hoping to generate from this development,” FFI’s director-western states Maia Schweizer told ABC. “[Ella Valla and Yalbago Stations] are not so much supporting the decarbonisation of FMG, but they could be supporting the export of green energy in some other form, so for example green hydrogen or green ammonia.”
FMG said the Uaroo Renewable Energy Hub will provide renewable energy to power its mining operations in the Pilbara and is a critical component of it achieve net zero emissions from its mining operations by 2030. The miner said the renewable electricity would eventually eliminate its reliance on gas and diesel-fired generation and diesel-fueled mobile plants such as haul trucks and trains which currently consume hundreds of millions of litres of fuel annually.
It is expected the Uaroo project would reduce the miner’s current annual carbon emissions of 2.2 million tonnes by at least 1.5 million tons by the end of this decade.
The renewable generation assets will be integrated with the company’s Pilbara Energy Connect program, which includes a AUD 250 million ($186.9 million) transmission project that will install 275 km of high voltage transmission lines connecting Fortescue’s mining operations in the region.
Interestingly, FFI isn’t done with its land acquisitions. “We have our eyes on a few other areas where that wind and sun is really high quality,” said Schweizer.
