The international company celebrated its 10th anniversary, surpassed 1 GW in microinverter shipments, marked a one-day delivery milestone, and further strengthened its relationships with partner companies, particularly in the emerging Latin American (LATAM) market.
APsystems was founded in Silicon Valley in 2010 and has become a global leader in the development, manufacturing, and marketing of module-level power electronics (MLPE) products based on its solar technology.
The company’s co-founders, President and CEO Dr. Zhi-Min Ling and Chief Technology Officer Dr. Yuhao Luo, both have experience in the semiconductor and photovoltaics industries, having served in leading roles at Xilinx and Solaria Corp.
Within about two years, APsystems launched its first single and duo microinverter products. Later, the company launched the YC1000, the first native three-phase quad microinverter, then the dual microinverter YC600 with RPC function, and the QS1 microinverter.
In 2016, Olivier Jacques joined APsystems as vice president. With experience across many high-tech industries, including executive-level positions at Enphase Energy and Samsung Electronics, Jacques played an important role in increasing revenues, developing sales channels, launching a new product platform, and repositioning the company as a value-added solutions provider.
Today, APsystems has grown to encompass several global subsidiaries with warehouses, sales, marketing, and technical support teams around the world, including LatAm, Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific, serving customers in more than 120 countries.
Main products include both AC-side microinverters and DC-side rapid shutdown devices for residential and commercial solar installations. The company’s EMA energy monitoring and analysis software also provides customer control over each individual module and microinverter in a solar array.
Alvin Xianyu, LATAM director of APsystems, called the company’s 10-year anniversary a “major landmark,” especially in the evolving inverter industry. “It has been a long and exciting journey,” said Xianyu. “The path we’ve taken to get here has been incredibly fulfilling and has brought a strong sense of accomplishment.”
The company has also been profitable each of the past nine years.
“Staying alive is one thing,” said Xianyu, “but growing profitably when you need to heavily invest in R&D on one side, while keeping enough agility to adapt to an ever-changing emerging market on the other side, is another challenge.”
He added that APsystems’ success is primarily due to the “hard work, determination, and patience of the hundreds of talented and committed people who have joined and believed in this company over the years.”
By the end of 2020, APsystems’ global cumulative microinverter shipments surpassed 1 GW, representing more than 3.5 million individual units. They are expected to generate a total 1.24 billion kWh annually and reduce carbon dioxide output by 910,000 tons, equal to the environmental benefits of 45 million trees.
When the impacts of Covid-19 started in early 2020, APsystems adjusted its production and business strategy in a timely manner and achieved growth in several main markets, including the United States, Europe, and LatAm.
APsystems plans to keep concentrating on product and market development. In fact, the company’s next goal is to achieve 1 GW of microinverter shipments annually.
It also reached a one-day delivery milestone last year: On Dec. 1, 2020, the company shipped 22,000 microinverter units totaling over 27 MW. Xianyu said the units were mostly quad microinverters, which offer distributors and installers increased reliability and lower MLPE system costs.
He added the delivery represented a record-setting moment for APsystems and an achievement for any inverter supplier to ship such volume in a single day.
In 2020, APsystems remained focused on steady growth in the emerging LatAm solar market, especially Brazil. To support that growth, the company also devoted itself to strengthening its relationships with key regional partners.
The company has been in the LatAm market for over eight years, and its products have earned a good reputation among regional installers and other industry stakeholders. Xianyu said the company saw the strong potential of the “fast-growing” LatAm market.
“When you combine sufficient solar irradiance with supportive policies on clean energy from local governments, you obtain strong driving factors which set the foundation for a growing and sustainable solar business in LatAm,” he explained.
Another key to APsystems' success in LatAm has been close collaboration with leading distributors. The company has been working with Ecori Energia Solar, one of the largest distributed generation (DG) PV system distributors in Brazil, for almost six years. Their partnership has helped increase APsystems’ presence in the promising Brazilian market.
“Both of us have the same view of the MLPE segment, and we treat each other as reliable partners as well as good friends,” said Xianyu.
“With a great sense of professionalism and ethics, together we created this market from scratch,” said Martins. “Our resellers started to migrate their sales from other technologies to APsystems microinverters, and they love it.”
Xianyu credited Ecori’s large business and service network in Brazil to the company’s “very professional team highly responsible for added value and contribution to this market through consistent best-in-class technical support and training.”
Although Brazil is among LatAm's largest solar markets, it still has some obstacles to overcome. “Each coin has two sides; opportunity and challenge always coexist,” said Xianyu.
He said APsystems keeps an eye on uncertainties like potential policy change, unstable exchange rates, and other big challenges like the unexpected impact of Covid-19. Xianyu also cited a desire to continually lower system costs so that microinverter solutions gain even more interest in commercial applications.
“The greatest challenge we face here is to ensure the resellers also do a great job on their installations,” said Martins. “We know that education and training are key for newcomers in the market, as many new companies need to acquire the necessary knowledge to guarantee high-quality installation services for residential and commercial system owners. We believe this is improving.”
Martins pointed out that Ecori offers free training, both online and at the company’s center in São Paulo city. He said, “We are always available to make our market more professional.”
Another challenge is the discussion over potential changes to Brazil’s DG rules. Martins said he hopes the country’s politicians will protect the solar industry, noting President Jair Bolsonaro “already gave many speeches in its favor.” Martins said some associations, such as Movimento Solar Livre, are also “doing a great job trying to avoid any kind of taxation.”
Both Martins and Xianyu are pleased and encouraged to see Brazil’s DG market becoming increasingly mature.
According to Brazilian solar association ABSolar, the country recently surpassed the historic mark of 7 GW of operational PV power. DG solar accounted for most of that capacity, with more than 4 GW installed. Brazil’s government also recently set a target of 45% renewables by 2050.
To help expand Brazil’s MLPE use, APsystems and Ecori plan on maintaining their partnership. Martins said the companies’ six-year relationship is “just the beginning of a very long journey together.”
APsystems already has some new solutions under development. Xianyu said the company will launch a new generation of microinverters for both residential and large roofs based on an entirely new architecture in a few months.

For example, Xianyu mentioned the new APsystems dual microinverter, the DS3. He said this third-generation dual microinverter is the result of unprecedented integration work that has enabled APsystems to reduce the number of components by 20%. It will offer unprecedented power density, delivering 50% more AC output power than the YC600, and will be “fully compatible with our current single-phase dual and quad, the YC600 & QS1, for installation on the same roof.”
After celebrating the company’s 10-year anniversary, reaching milestones, and strengthening key partnerships in emerging markets, APsystems is excited about the future.
“APsystems is now well recognized for its leadership in multi-module microinverter solutions, bringing innovative products to market that are built to last,” said Xianyu. “This is the DNA of the company and will continue to be.”

According to new figures published by Germany’s Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur), the total capacity of newly registered solar PV systems in Germany in February was 350.7 MW. This compares to 536 MW in January and 202.3 MW in February 2020.
Most of the February capacity–270 MW–comes from PV systems not exceeding 750 kW in size under the country's FIT scheme.
The newly installed PV capacity for the first two months of the year was 880,8 MW and the cumulative capacity of all subsidized PV systems in Germany reached 54.3 GW at the end of February.
Starting from tomorrow, tariffs for PV systems will fall 1.4%. The FIT for rooftop systems of up to 10 kW capacity will fall under the €0.08/kWh threshold for the first time, to reach €0.0781/kWh. The payment for installations with a capacity between 10 and 40 kW will be €0.0759/kWh.
Systems with a capacity of 40-100 kW will receive €0.0595/kWh. The payment for projects with a 40-750 kW capacity will be €0.0536/kWh. For other systems up to 100 kW in size, there is a fixed FIT of between €0.0363/kWh and €0.0227/kWh.

Ocean Sun said that the Cyprus-based renewables developer will use its floating PV technologies in utility-scale projects on inland reservoirs, but also for ocean applications.
“Some locations have been identified, like high power-consuming industry, e.g. cement production,” Ocean Sun CEO Børge Bjørneklett told pv magazine. “Focus is on both lakes and reservoirs as well as sheltered coastal regions.”
Bjørneklett said the projects will be developed as multi-megawatt floating plants, but at a number of sites, MP Quantum Group will set up demonstrators with capacities ranging from 2 MW to 4 MW.
“The pilots will be initiated later this year,” he said, adding that the permits for the first project will likely be secured by the end of this year.
The Norwegian company said that a comprehensive plan has been developed for the larger projects, with MP Quantum Group now working to secure permits.
“Floating solar is an excellent fit for the energy markets in Greece and Cyprus, with good irradiation, water resources and a commitment from authorities to push for the renewable energy transition,” said MP Quantum Group Chairman Yiannis Alafouzos. “Ocean Sun has a world-leading solution for floating solar with its low capex and high power output. In addition, the seaworthiness of the system enables deployment along our widespread shores and island communities.”
Ocean Sun has developed an innovative design for floating PV projects at near-shore locations and semi-sheltered bodies of water. The patented system includes a floating buoyancy ring anchored to the seabed with four mooring points and 12 lines. Last July, the company signed a deal to develop pilot projects for a 2.1 GW floating solar installation that is being planned near the Saemangeum tidal flats on the west coast of South Korea.
A number of floating PV projects have been announced in Greece in recent months. Greek conglomerate Gek Terna, for example, has announced plans to deploy large-scale floating PV plants on three different reservoirs, with a total investment of €170 million ($199 million). National utility PPC is also reportedly planning to deploy an additional 50 MW, while InterPhoton Group is considering building a 500 MW project.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/31/dnv-publishes-guidelines-for-proper-deployment-of-floating-pv/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,NETHERLANDS",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"MARCH 31, 2021",DNV publishes guidelines for proper deployment of floating PV,"Rebranded, Norway-based consultancy DNV has published a guide to help renewable energy developers in the construction of floating solar power plants.
The Recommended Practice guide, on top of describing the most common requirements for building a floating PV array, provides a series of technical guidelines for electrical safety, anchoring and mooring issues, operation and maintenance, and specific plant design that can withstand site-specific environmental conditions. “It aims to be valid and applicable in all major markets and geographic regions, for all defined applications within scope, from component level to system level, covering the entire life cycle,” its authors specified.
“It will take the industry around five years to reach full standardization,” said DNV consultant Michele Tagliapietra, adding that standards set by the IEC, ISO and DVN will be defined within two to four years, depending on component.
Launching the first global recommended practice document for floating solar, the company underlined that the technology requires significant attention on some parts of the system in the medium term. At the same time, a focus on durability and degradation will be needed in the long term.
“At the moment, in the medium term, the main cause of failure is [the] anchoring and mooring part of the system. This is not a surprise because these are new challenges for PV developers,” explained Tagliapietra.
The guide is a collaborative, joint industry project (JIP) involving 24 industry participants.
According to the paper, floating arrays can significantly increase the efficiency of PV technology. The total increase in energy yield will be positively influenced by stronger irradiation (around 2% more) and the cooling effect, although it can be negatively influenced by mismatch losses.
“When it comes to offshore PV, 5-10% higher yield is a broad but realistic range,” said Tagliapietra. “It depends on how you install the system. If you have systems detached from the water, you won’t have direct cooling from the water, you’ll, rather, have convective cooling, while if you have structures that are already installed in contact with the water, in that case you can have a higher efficiency boost because of a direct cooling effect,” said Tagliapietra.
In terms of safety and sustainability, the experts explained that the evaluation must be done case by case, depending on the floating structure and location.
“There are ongoing studies on how floating solar can be combined with marine life. It really depends on the layout and the conditions of the specific site,” Tagliapietra stated, adding there are cases of floating PV combined with aquaculture.
DNV said that installed capacity for floating solar power was just 10 MW at the end of 2015 but has accelerated considerably since then, reaching 2 GW at the end of last year. The first projects trace back to 2006.
“It is estimated that the total global potential capacity for deploying floating solar power on man made, inland waters alone could be as high as 4 TW [source: the World Bank] with an expected pipeline of more than 10 GW by 2025,” the company said.
Similar, Netherlands-focused guidelines for floating PV had been published by the Netherlands-based Foundation for Applied Water Research in February 2019.

English-language Bangladeshi newspaper The Daily Star made headlines in February when it published details of an apparently leaked letter sent to the government by Liu Zhenhua, an economic and commercial counsellor at the Chinese embassy in Dhaka.
Although the thrust of the letter concerned the Bangladeshi government's interest in securing soft loans–which it says were offered by China–for different infrastructure projects than those originally discussed, it is the fifth paragraph of the message which captured the attention of environmentalists.
Liu, from the economic and commercial counsellor's office of the Chinese embassy–according to the letterhead–writes: “The Chinese side shall no longer consider projects with high pollution and high energy consumption, such as coal mining, coal-fired power stations, etc.”
Given the infrastructure projects referred to are the subject of memoranda of understanding signed between the governments of the two nations because of Bangladesh's membership of China's huge, East-Asia-to-Europe-via-Africa infrastructure program, the message sparked speculation such an anti-coal stance might be applied to all the 130-140 countries which have signed up for BRI investment.
However, Christoph Nedopil Wang, director of independent policy and research body the Green Belt and Road Initiative Center, told pv magazine hopes for coal-free energy and infrastructure development along the overland and maritime trade routes which make up the BRI may be overblown.
Wang said such a policy diktat would have to come from higher levels of government and added, although his center is seeing more opportunity for renewables finance–in tandem with demand and supply side changes in coal project planning–clean energy spending may not be a simple affair.
For renewables, “some Chinese financial institutions are still working on building more capacity to invest in alternative energies abroad,” said Wang, who added: “energy systems in BRI countries are not necessarily able to deal with RE [renewable energy investment],” and “vested interests continue to favor coal.”
pv magazine has contacted the Chinese embassy in Dhaka to ask about the authenticity of the letter and about China's BRI coal investment policy.
This copy was amended on 06/04/21, at Christoph Nedopil Wang's request, to change his quote about the capacity of Chinese entities to invest in renewables abroad.

The Bolivian government has introduced, through Supreme Decree 4477, a net metering scheme for distributed-generation renewable energy power generators.
The new provisions came into force on March 24 and allow the owners of small-sized solar and other renewable energy systems to sell excess power to the grid.
The Ministry of Hydrocarbons and Energies presented the regulations, stating that Bolivians will now begin to be active players in the generation of electricity with environmentally-friendly sources. All installation of distributed generation must be carried out by specialized installation companies which are duly registered and authorized.
“What we hope to achieve in the first year of application of this measure is the economic reactivation of 400 small and medium-sized companies dedicated to the installation of photovoltaic systems,” said minister Franklin Molina. “It is expected to generate around 1,300 direct and indirect jobs during the first year, and to reach more than 3,000.”
Three project categories will be entitled to operate under the net metering regime: distributed micro-generation, not exceeding 10 kW in size; mini-generation systems, with power ranging from 10 kW to 50 kW; and commercial systems with a capacity between 50 kW and 350 kW.
Net metering tariffs will have to be set by the country's energy regulator, the Autoridad de Electricidad, Tecnología Nuclear. “The regulator will apply a minimum cost, that must be equivalent to the current minimum cost of the energy produced in the National Interconnected System, and a maximum equivalent to the final distribution cost, which will be applied based on the balance between consumption and hourly energy injected into the distribution network,” Molina explained.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Bolivia had an installed solar power capacity of 120 MW at the end of 2019. Most of this capacity comes from large scale solar plants like the Oruro Photovoltaic Solar Plant, located in central Bolivia.
Bolivia has a renewable energy target for 2025 of just 183 MW, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Currently, its energy demand is covered by 2 GW of installed power generation capacity, which is represented 60% by thermoelectric energy, and 40% by hydropower.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/31/multi-layer-front-contact-perovskite-solar-cells-with-16-55-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,JAPAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 31, 2021",Multi-layer front contact perovskite solar cells with 16.55% efficiency,"Researchers from Kanazawa University in Japan have developed a perovskite solar cell based on a titanium oxide (TiO2) compact electron transport layer (ETL), which they claim is the most efficient PV device of its kind to be produced at the research level to date.
They used a spray pyrolysis deposition (SPD) technique, which is generally used for temperature decomposition of organic material in the absence of oxygen. This process is known to provide excellent rate capability and high cycling stability. It is used in the chemical industry to produce ethylene, carbon and chemicals from petroleum, coal and even wood, in addition to producing coke from coal.
Via this method, the scientists deposited at an optimized TiO2 front-contact layer onto a set of planar perovskite solar cells, at 450 C.
“In a multi-layer front contact, a hole blocking/electron transport layer (ETL) is considered a key element that needs to be compact, smoothly distributed, and pin-hole-free to achieve high power conversion efficiency,” the academics explained, adding that the TiO2 front-contact layer can be applied to both single-junction perovskite cells and perovskite/perovskite tandem devices.
The solar cells built with the front-contact layer achieved an open-circuit voltage of 1.07 V, a short-circuit current of 21.3 mA cm−2, a fill factor of 72%, and an efficiency of 16.55%.
“This isn't quite as good as commercial silicon-based solar cells,” acknowledged researcher Md. Shahiduzzaman. “Nevertheless, electromagnetic simulations were a powerful tool for predicting the possible energy conversion efficiency limit by optimizing specific parameters.”
The scientists said the computational simulations they have conducted have shown that perovskite/perovskite tandem cells built with such configurations could achieve an efficiency of more than 30%.
“This is close to the theoretical efficiency limit of silicon-based solar cells,” Shahiduzzaman said.
They described the solar cells in “Spray Pyrolyzed TiO2 Embedded Multi-Layer Front Contact Design for High-Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells,” which was recently published in Nano-Micro Letters.
In March 2019, a separate group of scientists at Kanazawa University used anatase and brookite, which are two different variants of titanium dioxide, to improve the efficiency of perovskite-based solar cells. The use of the two minerals is said to considerably improve the control of electron transport out of the perovskite layer. And in January 2019, another group of Japanese researchers said they had used tin dioxide (SnO2), instead of more commonly used titanium dioxide, to produce perovskite solar cells.

This conclusion was drawn by two separate studies published this week by scientists at Aarhus University, in Denmark, and researchers from the German Aerospace Center (DLR).
In a study published in Joule, Aarhus University professor Marta Victoria and other scientists from universities and knowledge institutions in the U.S., Europe and Japan have shown how the 2050 integrated assessment modeling (IAM) scenarios from the IPCC have underestimated PV over the past 14 years, thus confirming the results of previous research conducted by scientists at the University of Geneva, in Switzerland. “Our paper reaches similar conclusions that the paper by [Marc] Jaxa-Rozen and [Evelina] Trutnevyte [did]” Victoria told pv magazine. “But we focus more on explaining the reasons behind that, which means the limitations of the model.”

The researchers analyzed, in particular, the integrated assessment models and partial equilibrium models used by the IPCC experts and found that the estimated levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for the PV technology was set too high. “Solar PV modules have maintained a learning rate of 23% since 1976, i.e., their cost reduces by 23% every time the capacity [manufactured] doubles,” the paper notes.
“All the models used by the IPCC in [its] reports apply a cost that falls to a minimum of €1 per installed watt in the year 2050. However, the average cost today is already cheaper than this. In other words, 30 years before previously assumed,” Victoria stated. “The IPCC emphasizes other energy sources and technologies and underestimates the contribution from solar cells.” According to her, the international institution should acknowledge the primary role of the PV technology in the global energy transition.
In another paper, published by Energy Strategy Reviews, researchers from the German Aerospace Center have compared cost assumptions for solar and wind technologies in global, regional, and national energy scenario studies from different institutions with the costs reported by the renewable energy industry. “Our results indicate that the trend of rapid cost declines has been structurally underestimated in virtually all future energy scenario analyses, and suggest that even the most recent studies refer to obsolete or very conservative values,” the authors of the study stated.
The German group selected scenarios that were released after 2015, including a long-term scenario of the energy system including the capacity structure for the power plant fleet, and provided cost estimates for capex and LCOE. “There are six regional or national studies that cover the USA, China, [the European] Union, India, Brazil, and South Africa, while the rest are … global,” the German paper specified. The studies were published by scientific researchers, government bodies, or non-governmental organizations including the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the European Commission, the Indian government, the International Energy Agency (IEA), and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), among others.
The paper notes that only one of the selected studies assumes that the LCOE of solar in 2050 will be lower than today's auction values. “In other words, planning agencies use costs of PV for 2050 that have been invalidated in today's market,” the paper's authors emphasized.
They explained that the economic potential of solar and renewables keep being largely underestimated while energy transformation and mitigation costs, by contrast, are being overestimated. “Researchers should also update assumptions on economic lifetimes, full-load hours, systems’ degradation, and operation and maintenance costs,” concluded the German group.

Quite apart from the carbon emissions reduction represented by the clean energy generated by the 1.2 MWp array at Rini Kusters’ fruit farm in Wadenoijen, the structure has been observed to reduce extreme high temperatures on the crop and also shield the plants from damp.
“Weather excesses are becoming more and more common, and they are harmful to the plants,” said Kusters. “The development of fungus on the fruit due to a too-wet climate, for example, is a problem that is increasingly frequent.”
The expansion of what was installed as a pilot project last year has borne fruit, said the farmer. “On the hottest day last year it was 10 degrees [Celsius] cooler under the solar panels. On the wettest day, the plants remained dry. It's a solution that I really believe in.”
Baywa, which yesterday said it has plans for 35 MWp of European agrivoltaics through next year, initially tested its solar array by shielding raspberries from the elements at Babberich, also in the Netherlands. The program was then expanded to several pilot schemes with the help of Wageningen University & Research, including Kusters' crop, said Baywa in a press release issued to publicize the technology.
The solar array will replace the poly tunnels which typically protect such crops and Baywa said it is testing its application on other crops in Europe, including apples and pears.
“We had already created one of the largest and most technologically sophisticated ‘fruitvoltaic’ solutions in Europe in 2020, with our 2.67 MWp raspberry PV installation in Babberich,” said Stephan Schindele, product manager for agri-PV at BayWa. “Today, we are very excited to continue this fantastic journey and see our efforts rewarded by entering a new chapter of agri-PV with a new berry crop in Wadenoijen.”

For comparison, in the previous three years, new PV additions had totaled 407 MW, 369 MW and 305 MW, respectively.
Provisional numbers released by Italian renewables association ANIE Rinnovabili and data from grid operator Terna indicate most of last year’s capacity was installed in July and August, with 83.3 MW and 101.7 MW of new solar, respectively.
Terna’s figures show more than 102.3 MW, in last year's trajectory, was supplied by projects bigger than 1 MW in scale. PV projects that do not exceed 1 MW in size account for almost all of the new capacity, at 523.1 MW. Residential PV systems up to 20 kW in size still accounted for the largest share, at around 250.4 MW of capacity. PV systems ranging from 20 kW to 100 kW accounted for 98.6 MW of the total. Meanwhile, commercial and industrial PV installations ranging from 100 kW to 1 MW hit 156.3 MW.
The country's regions with the highest development volumes were the Lombardy region, which brought 107.7 MW of new solar online, and the northern region of Veneto, with 80.9 MW. Sardinia and Piedmont finished the year with 66.2 MW and 64.1 MW, respectively.
The provisional figures indicate that Italy reached around 22 GW of cumulative solar capacity at the end of December. The nation’s National Integrated Plan for Climate and Energy aims for 50 GW of solar by 2030.

Eight areas with high solar potential are being explored by the Azeri authorities in the Kalbajar, Lachin, Gubadli, Zangilan, Jabrayil and Fuzuli regions, with the wind power potential of the first two also being assessed, according to the Dentons publication Investing in renewable energy projects in Europe, Dentons' Guide 2021.
The breakaway region of Nagorno Karabakh is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but was largely administrated by the unrecognized Republic of Artsakh from the end of the first Nagorno Karabakh war, in 1994, until fresh hostilities broke out in September. The recent conflict saw Azerbaijan make gains at the expense of neighboring Armenia, with the settlement ratified by regional power Russia.
The role solar might play in rebuilding the region's electricity grid was one of the highlights in the latest Dentons' Guide, which noted a “booming” clean power industry in Italy and the usual impressive progress in Germany while remarking on retroactive feed-in tariff cuts in Czechia and Ukraine and the refusal of Moscow to afford its renewables project developers any flexibility to mitigate the effects of Covid-19.
The publication stated “Germany should continue to be an attractive market for investments in renewables;” noted Poland is “turning into a major renewables construction site”–especially if EU state aid chiefs approve its plans for a new auction schedule; and reported solar and wind are “booming again” in Italy. The latter statement already appears dated, however, given it mentions plans by “the government” to introduce a new renewables incentive program and refers to “prime minister Giuseppe Conte.” Which government is that exactly?
In surveying 21 nations in a definition of ‘Europe' which appears to be as loose as that adopted by football governing body UEFA, Dentons also noted the collapse in government finances in Russia prompted by the plunging price of oil and gas, with the resulting budget cuts meaning the target of installing 7 GW of clean power generation capacity by 2035 may be reined in to 3 GW. With local content requirements for renewables equipment set to rise to 98-100% over 15 years, and the authorities in Moscow showing a reluctance to extend the deadlines for projects delayed by Covid-19, the law firm anticipates continuing struggles in the Russian sector.
There were similar troubles in Slovakia which, with the EU hinting it should raise its 2021-30 target for the proportion of renewables in its power mix from 20% to 24%, is instead proposing it be cut, to 19.2%. That would anticipate a possible reduction in clean power capacity, explained by the prospect of an incentive payment cliff-edge in 2025-27 for projects installed in 2010-12. In that scenario, Dentons envisages clean power plants being disconnected.
Ireland stands on a knife edge, according to the report, after impressive progress in renewables, led by wind power–which also became the leading renewable technology across the Irish Sea in the U.K. for the first time, the report noted. Irish government policy on tax, grid charges and balancing costs, planning, and environmental permits could equip the nation with anything from the cheapest to the most expensive clean electricity costs in Europe, according to the study.
Elsewhere it was noted Belgium has blamed a lack of private sector cash for missing its 2020 renewables target, France and Hungary are both still wedded to nuclear, Georgia is liberalizing its electricity market despite a creaking grid, Kazakhstan‘s best intentions are being undermined by the financial position of its state energy offtaker, and Romania‘s government is running out of time to introduce an EU directive which rules out unjustifiable obstacles to the signing of private power purchase agreements. The usual grid constraints in the Netherlands were mentioned, Spain's ambitious auction program is similarly haunted by a lack of grid connections–”preventing a number of projects from being developed”–and Turkey's clean power industry is set to be held back by a wildly fluctuating lira, which is what its incentives regime will be linked to from June 30.
Perhaps most surprising of all, though, was the revelation the micro state of Luxembourg is grappling with “the challenges presented by rapid population growth.” Who knew?

Renewables plus batteries could offer Australia’s National Energy Market (NEM) the same energy security and reliability as coal and gas generators, according to new report commissioned by The Australia Institute, a think tank in Canberra. 
Historically, coal plants and other “synchronous” generators such as gas and hydro facilities have kept frequency and voltage in the electricity grid within safe limits. However, ministers are soon set to agree on the Energy Security Board's Post-2025 proposal to redesign the National Electricity Market, and this has prompted The Australia Institute to propose new rule changes, so such functions are not automatically relegated to fossil fuel-based sectors.
The technical study underpinning the report was conducted by the Victorian Energy Policy Centre. It aimed to provide input into the Energy Security Board’s Post-2025  review.
“The technical study finds that batteries and renewable energy are becoming competitive with conventional sources of inertia and system strength. There is no technical obstacle to them replacing the system security which has been provided by coal and gas generators,” said Dan Cass, energy policy and regulatory lead at The Australia Institute. “The rules governing the provision of inertia and system strength are not fit for purpose for the Post-2025 market. They are a brake on the clean energy transition and undermine state-based Renewable Energy Zones.”
New inverter-based sources are already proving to be cheaper and better than legacy technologies, Cass said. He pointed to one project in Queensland that has tuned its inverters at four large solar projects for around 4% of the cost of a conventional synchronous condenser solution.
“Batteries can deliver far more system security than a coal generator of the same power capacity. When EnergyAustralia announced that the 1.48 GW Yallourn coal power station would close in 2028, it also announced a new 350 MW battery will be built in 2026. The battery is likely to be able to provide at least three times as much inertia as Yallourn, despite a capacity a quarter as large,” Cass said.
Clean energy resources have traditionally been excluded from providing system security, the report says, but it notes that this began to shift in 2017. However, Cass said that “regulatory barriers continue to be the key limitation on batteries and renewable energy providing system security.”
The Australia Institute has also found that there is popular support for using clean energy technologies to support the grid, rather than coal and gas. In March 2021, it conducted a national opinion poll of 1,040 people and found that 51% of Australians would prefer to pay for new batteries to keep the grid secure, where 26% would prefer to continue to pay for coal generators.
The Australia Institute is proposing three key objectives for the Post-2025 redesign: more competition, the promotion of innovation, and pragmatism in accommodating state policies. The full report is available on The Australia Institute’s website.

Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Princeton University have discovered that innovative and low-cost long-duration energy storage (LDES) technologies could have a big impact on efforts to affordably decarbonize the electricity system.
The team defined LDES as a range of emerging technologies that can respond to the variable output of renewables, discharging electrons for days and even weeks, while also providing resilience to the electric grid. In a recent paper in Nature Energy, the researchers looked at whether LDES paired with renewable energy sources and short-duration energy storage options such as lithium-ion batteries could power a big, cost-effective move to a decarbonized grid. They also looked at whether LDES might end the need for low-carbon energy sources such as nuclear power and natural gas fitted with carbon capture and sequestration.
The researchers surveyed technologies such as pumped hydropower storage, vanadium redox flow batteries, aqueous sulfur flow batteries, and firebrick resistance-heated thermal storage, among others. There were a number of key takeaways:
The researchers said that niche market opportunities for LDES currently exist, like in places with a lot of solar and wind already deployed, where transmission limits exist. In such places, storage could fill up when transmission is at its limit, and then export power later, while maximizing the use of power line capacity.
