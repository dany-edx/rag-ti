The continent could use its “plentiful solar and wind resources” to produce 30 million to 60 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of green hydrogen by the midway point of the century, they said. It could also become the world's most competitive source of green hydrogen by 2030, with estimated costs of $1.80/kg to $2.60/kg, but falling to $1.20/kg to 1.60/kg by 2050. They said $320 billion to $610 billion of investment will go to renewables needed to produce hydrogen, while $115 billion to $220 billion will be needed for electrolysis plants. Masdar and McKinsey said most of the capital needed for export projects would come from foreign investors.
Ben-Gurion University researchers and Israel Institute of Technology scientists have revealed new ways to speed up the catalytic process in water splitting, aided by solar energy. Oxygen evolution requires the transfer of four electrons to create one oxygen molecule (O2) and two hydrogen molecules (H2). According to the current paradigm, those electrons move one after the other in a sequence of four steps on an atomic reaction site, which makes the chemical reaction energetically difficult. The researchers said that two electrons can be simultaneously transferred at different reaction sites, reducing the energy barriers for oxygen evolution. “The prevalence of parallel pathways fundamentally broadens the current paradigm of the water photo-oxidation reaction mechanism,” the said in a recently published study in Energy & Environmental Science. “It may inspire new strategies to reduce the high overpotential of this reaction so as to enhance the efficiency of solar fuel production.”
Pertamina Power Indonesia, Keppel Infrastructure, and Chevron have signed an agreement to jointly explore the development of green hydrogen and green ammonia projects in Sumatra, Indonesia. They are considering green hydrogen facilities with production capacities of at least 40,000 tons per annum, powered by 250 MW to 400 MW of geothermal energy in the initial phase. The hydrogen production facility could have the potential to scale up to 80,000 tons to 160,000 tons per year, “depending on the availability of geothermal energy as well as market demands,” said Singapore-based Keppel Infrastructure.
Asahi Kasei has started building an alkaline water electrolysis pilot test plant for hydrogen production at its site in Kawasaki, Japan. It said it aims to start operations in early 2024. The system features a changeable configuration with one to four 0.8 MW water electrolysis modules.
Oman and the Netherlands have agreed to cooperate on hydrogen under a letter of intent signed on the sidelines of COP27. “The declaration of intent is a concrete starting point for cooperation between the Port of Rotterdam and the Port of Sohar,” the Dutch government said in a statement. “Through these ports, the Netherlands can start importing green hydrogen from Oman.”
H2Pro and Gaia Energy have agreed to build a pilot green hydrogen project in Morocco, in addition to studying the feasibility of an electrolyzer “gigafactory” in the African country. The agreement is not Gaia Energy's first such deal with Israeli companies, as it signed an agreement with Gander earlier this year to collaborate on renewable energy projects.
ReNu Energy has announced the signing of a term sheet with HESTA, an Australian industry superannuation fund, to invest up to AUD 100 million ($66.8 million) in green hydrogen projects. ReNu Energy said the term sheet is a “non-binding, strategic framework” that will eventually be “converted into definitive arrangements, subject to HESTA completing its due diligence.”

The company’s entry into the wholesale electricity market was marked by the ringing of the NZX bell.
Over the past year, NZX, Transpower, Panasonic and Auckland University have jointly developed the software. They have also integrated the solarZero platform and validated the ability of the VPP to participate in the market.
SolarZero is now starting a staged enrollment of its 10,000 household battery systems into the New Zealand electricity reserves market to provide fast, sustained reserves. The VPP will help state-owned Transpower maintain a stable electricity grid as the nation transitions to 100% renewable energy by 2030.
SolarZero shares revenue from trading in the market with its community members through a monthly eco-bonus credit. Every member can expect to be credited NZD 18,000 ($10,722) over the next 20 years by lending their solar batteries to take part in its VPP, thus reducing their power bills. The company claims the solarZero community currently saves more than NZD 2.3 million on annual energy costs.
“In the face of the highest energy prices in the history of New Zealand, every home that has a roof can now earn extra income, safely power through blackouts, and support their community by reducing the cost of electricity for everyone,” said Andrew Booth, solarZero CEO.
Earlier this year, solarZero made headlines as US investor BlackRock agreed to acquire the company as part of its push into renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific region. At the time, solarZero claimed a 40% market share of new residential rooftop solar installs in New Zealand and had approximately 8,500 systems under its belt across the residential, commercial, and community sectors.
Biggest battery
In another momentous development for New Zealand's battery energy storage market, Meridian Energy revealed that it has secured the green light for a 100 MW battery – the island country's largest such system to date. It will provide additional reserve power and resilience to the national grid.
The battery system is the first stage of Meridian Energy’s Ruakākā Energy Park, north of Auckland, and will also include a 125 MW solar farm. Construction is scheduled to begin early next year on land adjacent to the former Marsden Point oil refinery. It is expected to be completed in 2024.
“It will provide reserve power in the event of insufficient generation by allowing more electricity to flow north from the South Island, and by storing power from the grid during off-peak periods,” said Rebecca Knott, Meridian Energy's head of renewable development. “When fully charged, it would be capable of powering 60,000 average households for two hours over a winter’s evening.”
In addition to improving resilience and reducing the chance of network outages, Knott said the battery storage capacity will likely have a modest positive impact on regional and national power prices.
The biggest battery currently under construction in New Zealand is a 35 MW system in Waikato on the North Island. The system, developed by WEL Networks and developer Infratec, is expected to go online in December. The equipment supply contractors include Saft and Power Electronics NZ.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/11/the-economic-case-for-heat-pumps-in-poland/,"MARKETS,POLICY,POLAND",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"NOVEMBER 11, 2022",The economic case for heat pumps in Poland,"There is a strong economic case for owning and operating heat pumps in Poland, despite high upfront costs, according to RAP. In a new report, “Cleaning up heat: The changing economics for heat pumps in Poland,” the non-governmental organization shows that heat pumps are particularly economically competitive amid current high prices for fossil fuels.
The capex and opex for heat pumps are still higher than for fossil-based heating technologies in Poland. Prior to this year's energy price surge, the total cost of ownership (TOC) for air-to-water heat pumps was estimated at €8,000, according to the report. Coal stoves cost around €1,500, while gas boilers came in at €3,000.
“In terms of operating costs, heat pumps were almost on par with fossil technologies,” said RAP. “According to 2021 prices, operating a heat pump cost around €12,500 over its lifetime compared to a coal stove at €11,700 and a gas boiler at €11,500.”
However, RAP’s analysis shows that running costs for heat pumps are considerably inferior to coal and gas technologies in high heating-fuel price scenarios, compensating for their higher upfront cost.
“A doubling and tripling of the price of residential coal … leads to a TCO increase of 82% and 164%, respectively,” said RAP. “Increasing household gas prices from 2021 to 2022 levels raises the TCO by 12%, while a 50% increase in the gas price corresponds to a 38% increase in TCO.”
The report also studies the effects of Poland’s block tariff on electricity for households. It currently freezes prices for electricity consumption up to 2,000 kWh at 2022 levels and charges a higher rate for usage above this limit. Given that 2,000 kWh is the average Polish household demand for non-heating uses, “all electricity used by heat pumps would be subject to higher retail prices, although still capped below their market value,” said RAP.
Under a scenario involving high electricity retail prices of €189/MWh, the TCO for heat pumps is more competitive than for coal furnaces, but still €4,200 more expensive than gas boilers.
RAP suggests raising the block tariff to 5,000 kWh, which would cover 80% of the electricity use of heat pumps. Under that scenario, the TCO of a heat pump would be €3,400 more competitive than a coal furnace. The cost different in respect to gas boilers would fall to €2,100.
“Going forward, the key questions around the economics of heat pumps will be the relative volatility of fossil fuels versus electricity prices and government policies incentivizing clean heating solutions,” said RAP.
Poland was reportedly Europe's fastest-growing market for heat pumps in 2021. Sales rose by 67% from 2020, with more than 93,00 units sold, according to the report. In the first half of 2022, the Polish heat pump market grew by 86% year on year.

It has yet to reveal its investment in the 4.6 GW Kuara solar park, which will feature 8 million solar modules from an undisclosed manufacturer. The project will cover 7.8 thousand hectares of unused farmland between the municipalities of Aracati e Icapuí, in the Brazilian state of Ceará.
The environmental council of Ceará met this week to discuss the project's environment license, and decided to postpone its final decision until Dec. 1. It noted that a member of the Order of Attorneys of Brazil has asked to visit the project site before casting a vote.
According to local media reports, Omega Energia will sell some of the electricity to Australian iron ore producer Fortescue. The company plans to build an industrial green hydrogen plant in the port of Pecém, about 200 km from the solar project site.
The world’s two largest PV parks to date are now under construction in China. State-owned China Huadian is building a 3.3. GW solar park in Changdu, Sichuan province. A second 3 GW solar installation is also planned in Zhongwei, in China's Ningxia Hui region.

The short-circuit current is between 13.66 A and 13.84 A, with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V.
The Chinese module manufacturer said the new modules measure 2,279 mm x 1,134 mm x 32 mm and weigh 29 kg. They feature 3.2 mm anti-reflective glass and an IP68 enclosure, with a temperature coefficient of -0.35% per degree Celsius. The operational temperature of the panels ranges from -40 C to 85 C.
They come with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 12-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 2% and the 25-year power output is guaranteed to be no less than 84.80% of the nominal output power.
“The module has a beautiful appearance and does not accumulate water or dust,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine, in reference to the frameless frontside, which allows rain to wash away dust.
DAH Solar says the design improves the PV module’s drainage function, so the rain washes away the dust and reduces dust sedimentation. This feature can reportedly reduce the frequency of cleaning operations and maintenance activities and also help avoid hotspots.
“The new module perfectly suits steel rooftops with small installation angles,” the spokesperson went on to say. “In the actual application of distributed PV installation, the smaller the installation angle, the more the dust shading at the bottom of the regular PV modules.”
DAH Solar is based in Hefei, Anhui province. It currently operates a 2 GW solar panel factory.

French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire and Agnès Pannier-Runacher, the nation's energy transition minister, said on Nov. 10 that the government will set up a guarantee fund to support power purchase agreements for renewables. By covering default risks for industrial buyers, the fund will help to facilitate the signing of long-term PPAs with industrial companies.
“This is a major step forward that will make it possible to remove one of the main obstacles to the development of long-term energy supply contracts,” said Pannier-Runacher. “This system is complementary to the measures that we are taking in favor of PPAs within the bill to accelerate renewable energy.”
French financial services provider Bpifrance will run the system, with the aim of securing the first contracts in 2023. The fund will enable the closing of contracts for up to 500 MW of cumulative installed power.
“Our ambition is there,” said Roland Lescure, the minister delegate in charge of industry. “And it is only the beginning.”
The terms of the compensation granted to contracts in default will operate on a mode close to additional remuneration. The fund will be self-funded by the premiums paid by guaranteed contracts and the recovery of part of their excess income, in the event of high market prices.

The system is suitable for off-grid life enthusiasts and those having a strong belief to go green with solar energy. It can be utilized as a home backup option in some special conditions like emergencies or power outages, especially when combined with its expandable pack and the possibility of connecting two units together to use combined power.

The system is equipped with lithium-ion battery technology provided by Chinese manufacturer CATL, which offers higher temperature resistance while producing very low noise. This is in part due to the high quality of its CATL battery cells, which are more efficient and safer than other market options, while also offering a lifespan of more than 2,000 cycles and a 5-year warranty.
Powered by two wheels at the back and an expandable handle, transporting the Mango Power E is very similar to using a suitcase.

The portable battery has a high capacity of 3.5 kWh, which can be expanded up to 14 kWh with a pluggable pack in order to cater to the power needs of more demanding environments. Up to two standalone or expanded units can be connected together to further increase capacity all the way to 28 kWh. It provides 3 kW output capability (expandable to 6kW) and supports 240 V output to power heavy-duty appliances.

The plant is based on Brenmiller Energy's storage technology. The Israel-based company's system uses rocks that store excess energy as heat, then releases that heat to generate steam for electricity. The system has a capacity of about 24 MWh of thermal capacity and can be fully charged and discharged in about five hours.
“In this first-of-a-kind application, the TES is integrated with a combined cycle gas turbine power plant to partially decouple production from the gas turbine and the bottoming steam cycle,” said Nicola Rossi, head of innovation at Enel's renewable energy unit, Enel Green Power. “The TES is charged by steam coming from the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).”
Rossi said the aim is to increase the overall flexibility of the thermoelectric plant, which means having faster ramp-up rates, reducing minimum load, and having faster startup times from warm conditions.
“In this way, the plant can offer more services to the grid, thus increasing the overall renewable energy hosting capacity of the electrical system,” he said. 
They use high-pressure steam at around 9 tons per hour at 550 C and 80 bar to charge the TES during the charging phase. Condensate coming out of the TES goes back to the steam cycle at a degasator. During the discharging phase, 150 C water feeds the TES at around 6 tons per hour. The intermediate pressure steam then goes back to the HRSG to feed the intermediate pressure steam turbine stage at 360 C.
“[This] will allow for the technology to be tested in very challenging conditions,” Rossi said. “In the future, the system will be charged electrically through resistors fed by solar and wind power plants. The heat accumulated in the system will be then used to feed industrial sectors that need heat for their production processes and that today use gas to produce the required heat, or to generate electricity”
Enel believes that the most interesting business case for the system would be using it for electrification purposes, to make heat demand from industrial customers more flexible.
“The TES will be used both as power-to-heat equipment and a thermal storage,” Rossi said. “In fact, TES technologies already have a configuration that uses a direct electric charge with resistors instead of steam during the charging phase. Therefore, the TES matches a renewable energy generation profile and the heat demand profile, supporting 24/7 full decarbonization.”
Enel says another interesting application is that the TES replaces a conventional boiler in phased-out thermal power plants.
“In this configuration, an electrically charged TES integrated with the plant’s existing power island, including turbines, generator, condenser and other main equipment, represents a real power-to-power energy storage system, that despite the lower efficiency, offers a competitive solution in terms of levelized cost of storage (LCoS) for long durations of over eight hours and very large-scale applications of hundreds of MWh up to GWh,” it said.
TES could also be an interesting technology for hybridizing different generation assets, according to the company.
“For instance, heat accumulated by PV or wind in peak production hours could be reinjected in existing plants such as geothermal plants to produce more energy during demand peak hours,” Rossi said. “In all the above-mentioned future applications, the TES could be directly coupled with RES (PV or other) or connected to the grid and using other tools like PPAs to manage the charging phase.”

The structure features two vertical poles, spaced at a distance of 14 meters. It can be equipped with a single-axis or double-axis tracking system, which produces a dynamic, controlled shadow on the ground.
“The shadow precision on the ground, as well as shadow dynamics, increase with the rotation degree,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The control system can move the PV modules in different configurations, the shadow is maximum when the modules are perpendicular to the sun, but they can also rotate to let full light on the ground. This is particularly important for certain crops during the flowering phase.”
The structure's horizontal steel profile is able to rotate around its axis and can host four smaller profiles mounted perpendicular to the horizontal axis, which are also able to rotate around their axes. Each of the four profiles can host up to six bifacial panels, with the entire horizontal profile reaching 24 modules. The distance between the solar panel rows can vary between 12 meters and 18 meters.
“Each horizontal structure may host between 13 kW and 17 kW of solar modules,” the spokesperson said. “This would correspond up to between 600 kW and 800 kW per hectare, depending on the PV modules nominal power, the distance between the row,s and the needs of the crops.”
Rem Tec claims the new structure is ideal for flat surfaces with a maximum slope of 3%.
“Our system makes it possible the dynamic control of the shadow, which in turn reduces the hydric stress of the plantation underneath,” the spokesperson said. “We are also currently developing a mono-axial tracker for higher slopes, up to 12%.”
Rem Tec is currently conducting extensive research on several crops at different geographical latitudes.
“We know that most of the crops can have a real benefit from the shadow, such as salads and cabbage, red fruits, grapes, corn and many others, while some crops depend on the environmental condition and latitude of the plant,” the spokesperson added. “In general, when designing the plant, we start from the needs of the crops and adapt the layout accordingly, for example by changing the distance between the rows to change the shadow ratio. Our target is to keep the crop production yield on average minimum on the same level as an open field for several years, or even to increase it.”
The company recently announced plans to cooperate with Portuguese energy company Galp on the installation of a pilot plant at a vineyard in Lisbon.
“This new facility will be operational in the first quarter of 2023,” the spokesperson said.

The 31SG Balancer engine is 8% more powerful than its predecessor, with an electrical power of 12.4 MW and 52.3% efficiency.
“Our latest grid-balancing engine is designed to help utilities transform the energy mix of their power plant portfolios, so that the lowest cost technologies, renewables, provide most of the power, most of the time,” said Risto Paldanius, vice president Americas at Wärtsilä.
The engine is designed to provide unlimited fast starts and shutdowns, in order to support the grid amid variable renewable energy generation. It can connect to the grid in 30 seconds.
“The advantage of pairing our engines with solar PV is that energy can be delivered round the clock, even when the sun isn’t shining,” a Wärtsilä spokesperson told pv magazine. “To do this requires careful planning and integration of assets, to ensure the lowest total emissions and cost of electricity for the customer.”
The solution includes prefabricated power plant modules. The company claims this reduces site work by 30%, bringing installation times to just a few days. It also includes Wärtsilä lifecycle services for remote monitoring.
The 31SG Balancer is suitable for “most geographical locations, latitudes, and power systems. The engine can be configured to operate in both extreme cold and hot climates, ranging from -40 C to 45 C,” the company said. Its price is “cost competitive with other competing technologies due to low initial investment and optimized operational expenditure.”
The engine can run on natural gas, biogas, or hydrogen blends. It could also be adapted to use sustainable fuels in the future, according to the company.

These are typically gallium-arsenide (GaAs) and other materials and technologies that are too expensive for regular solar energy applications, despite their impressive performance.
Making solar cells from these materials as thin as possible, to minimize consumption of expensive materials, has been investigated by some as a way to bring costs down to more acceptable levels. Such ultra-thin devices are also of interest to those developing PV for space applications, as they are both lighter and inherently more resistant to damage caused by various types of radiation often present in Earth’s orbit and beyond. But maintaining high performance at very low device thickness is also a challenge.
A group of scientists led by Cambridge University fabricated an active layer of GaAs just 80 nanometers thick and integrated this into a cell with a rear surface mirror to enhance light absorption. They then measured the performance of these cells before and after exposure to radiation.
They found that their design allowed for much thinner solar cells to maintain good performance levels, while offering improved resistance to radiation, thanks to thickness alone. Thinner solar cells are more resistant to radiation, because trapped light particles have less distance to travel, and radiation’s effect on particle diffusion length cannot affect the cell performance anywhere near as quickly.
“Our ultra-thin solar cell outperforms the previously studied, thicker devices for proton radiation above a certain threshold,” explained Cambridge University scientist Armin Barthel. “The ultra-thin geometries offer favorable performance by two orders of magnitude relative to previous observations.”
In terms of actual applications, the group notes that its new cell design could prove useful in satellites bound for higher regions of Earth’s orbit – which have higher radiation levels, and will increasingly need to be used as lower orbit segments become more cluttered. Powering exploration of more distant parts of the solar system could also require higher radiation tolerances than those available today, with the group noting Jupiter’s moon of Europa as one environment that it’s new device could open up to study.
The cost benefits are also clear. The group calculated that thanks to its improved radiation tolerance, its cells could deliver the same amount of power after 20 years with less than one-third the amount of protective glass that thicker cells require.
The results, along with deeper analysis of the effects of radiation on solar cell performance, can be found in “Radiation effects in ultra-thin GaAs solar cells,” which was recently published in the Journal of Applied Physics.

New Delhi-based Gautam Solar has released its new G-2X series mono PERC modules with 450 Wp of power output. They are built with 120 half-cut cells based on M10 wafers and offer a power conversion efficiency of up to 21.28%.
The company said its 450 Wp M10 modules are made for rooftop solar installations. The modules are compact and lightweight, and only require two purlins to install, compared to four purlins for higher-wattage M10 modules, said Gautam Solar.
The modules measure 1,923 mm x 1,134 mm x 35 mm and have a power density of 206.4 W per square meter. The modules incorporate multi-busbar technology for reduced internal resistance losses and round ribbons for better light utilization. The modules come in monofacial and bifacial variants.
