The AT48-200H measures 660 mm x 855 mm x 360 mm and weighs 89.9 kg. It uses lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) as the cathode material.
The UK-based LED lighting specialist said the lithium-iron system has a storage capacity of 10 kWh and a nominal voltage of 51.2 V. It has an ambient operating temperature range of -20 C to 70 C, with a recommended temperature range of 10 C to 45 C.
“Tested and certified by European standards, the battery is compatible with systems of matching specifications regardless of the brand, making them ideal for users looking to upgrade their existing systems,” V-Tac said in a statement.
V-Tac said the battery comes with a five-year warranty and can operate for more than 5,000 cycles. It recently started distributing products for the solar industry. Its new solar catalog includes monocrystalline half-cell and TOPCon PV modules, inverters, and other solar batteries.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/31/zinc-bromine-redox-flow-batteries-with-superpower-density/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 31, 2023",Zinc-bromine redox flow batteries with superpower density,"Unlike their cousins, vanadium redox flow batteries (RFBs), which suffer from intrinsic low energy density, zinc-bromine RFBs have high theoretical energy densities (440 Wh/kg). However, the poor kinetics and poor reversible behavior of Br2/Br− redox activity pose significant barriers to realizing that potential.
To increase the efficiency of the flow cell, researchers at the Central Electrochemical Research Institute (CECRI) in India have developed graphite felt (GF) supported platinum-nickel (PtNi) bimetallic alloy-based electrode. The 3D structure GF -based metal particles decorated electrode-based flow cells showed an impressive performance at all the tested conditions.
The Ni-rich Pt0.5Ni1@HT-GF-based flow cell accomplished a superpower density of about 1550 mW cm−2, which is greater than that of a bare GF-based flow cell at 1260 mW cm−2. The cycle life showed excellent stability up to 300 cycles with coulombic, voltage, and energy efficiency of 97%, 86%, and 83%, respectively.
According to the researchers, the improved redox kinetics parameters are due to the high electro-catalytic nature of the heat-treated Ni-rich PtNi coating deposited on the GF. In the process of testing, the sample cell was subjected to different current densities from 20 to 140 mA cm−2.
Considering the high cost of platinum, the metal’s content was kept to a minimum and the redox reaction was augmented on the back of nickel’s catalytic activity. The bimetal catalyst was deposited on the 3D GF network electrode via a chemical reduction method.
The new research is said to offer a promising approach to developing effective electrode materials for a superpower RFB system. The scientists discuss their findings in “Nanocatalyzed PtNi Alloy Intact @3D Graphite Felt as an Effective Electrode for Super Power Redox Flow Battery,” which was recently published in Advanced Materials.

In one of the case studies, the communities of Shungnak and Kobuk deployed a solar-plus-storage system coupled with electrical heat pumps for households. The communities have a combined population of 361 people, according to the 2020 Census Reporter.
The solar-battery system was deployed to replace diesel generators, and the heat pumps to increase building energy efficiency and reduce the use of diesel-fueled furnaces. The initiative was launched when a change in the local river levels prevented barges from delivering diesel.
The communities acted as an independent power producer (IPP). The Northwest Arctic Borough (NWAB) developed the project and provided $800,000 in funding, topped with $1.3 million from the US Department of Agriculture. The Alaska Village Electric Cooperative (AVEC) performed an energy audit on 80 households in Shungnak and Kobuk to access the benefit of heat pumps, adding a cost of about $1.02 million. The two communities signed a power purchase agreement with AVEC and NWAB to complete the project.
The system consists of a 223.5 kW PV array on two strings with a 100 kW inverter each, coupled with a 352 kWh battery and a 250 kW inverter supplied by California-based Box Power. It uses bifacial modules from an undisclosed manufacturer, with no tracking, and an 11% capacity factor.
“The arrays are pointed in different directions to better distributed their power generation throughout long Arctic summer days,” the researchers said.
The system uses microcontrollers to turn off diesel generators when they drop to 30% load during the summer. The study did not provide any technical details about the heat pumps.
Results show that the PV system produces 200 MWh of electricity per year, offsetting 14,300 gallons of diesel. The battery can power Shungnak and Kobuk “for a few hours,” the report says. The communities expect households to save between $2,000 to $2,500 a year each by replacing diesel furnaces with heat pumps. The renewables system provides an estimated 11% to 15% of their electricity mix.
“No pushback was received from community members, and the NWAB is waiting to see how members respond to the project before moving forward,” the report says.
In order to displace more diesel, the IPP plans to upgrade the inverter to 500 kW to meet a winter peak load of 300 kW and add a 100 kW wind turbine to the system. The communities are also looking for funding to install more household heat pumps.
“These pumps make more sense when building a new house and less when removing existing equipment and replacing it,” the report said.
The study concluded that good relationships with suppliers, consultants, and contractors were essential to the success of the project. In particular, the close involvement of the local tribe, the Native Village of Shungnak, simplified land and equipment ownership.
The report also includes the results of a survey on the needs and challenges identified by Arctic communities that don't have renewable energy projects.

The UK company's 19-seat Dornier 228 testbed aircraft is retrofitted with a full-size prototype hydrogen-electric powertrain on the left wing. “This is the largest ZeroAvia engine tested to date, and places the company on the direct path to a certifiable configuration to be finalized and submitted for certification in 2023,” it said. The aircraft has a 600 kW powertrain twin-engine on its left wing and a single Honeywell TPE-331 stock engine on the right. “The hydrogen-electric powertrain comprises two fuel cell stacks, with lithium-ion battery packs providing peak power support during take-off and adding additional redundancy for safe testing,” the company said, noting that the hydrogen tanks and fuel cell power generation systems were embedded in the cabin.
Chinese researchers has reported a superaerophilic/superaerophobic cooperative electrode that can promote bubble removal in electrolyzers. The Chinese Academy of Sciences and Beihang University researchers introduced titanium-based superaerophilic (SAL) stripes covered with gas cushions on the platinum-based electrode. Superaerophobic (SAB) electrocatalytic regions surrounded the SAL stripes. The stripes acted as gas channels to transport hydrogen out. They noted that bubble adhesion on the electrode, bubble dispersion in the vicinity of the electrode, and poor dissolved hydrogen diffusion are common problems in electrolysis. “Benefiting from the enhanced mass transfer, the overpotential for the SAL/SAB cooperative electrode at −10 mA cm−2 is only −19 mV, compared to −61 mV on the flat Pt electrode,” they wrote in Science Advances.
Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology researchers have found that hydrogen production systems based on waste heat systems at 22.91% offer the highest overall efficiency. System efficiency ranges from 11.6% to 22.91%, while the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) ranges from $1.19/kg to $12.16/kg, the researchers said. “The lowest value is obtained when waste heat is employed, followed by the grid, PV panels, and wind turbines. Wind turbine systems are not recommended at selling prices of $8/kg and $10/kg,” they wrote in a recent article in Energy Conversion and Management.
Centrica Business Solutions is working with Germany’s 2G Energy to provide customers with 100% hydrogen-ready combined and heat power (CHP) systems in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Italy. “With a return on investment of less than 12 months for some projects, hydrogen ready CHP remains an energy saving quick-win,” said the England-based company. 
Fusion Fuel has signed an offtake agreement with Portuguese natural gas utility Dourogás for green hydrogen from its projects in Portugal. “This represents Fusion Fuel’s first offtake contract aimed at blending green hydrogen within the Portuguese natural gas grid,” said the Irish company. The Evora facility will likely be commissioned this year. The facility is expected to produce roughly 40 tons of green hydrogen per year.
Hydrogène de France (HDF Energy) has signed a memorandum of understanding with the province of Kinshasa, Congo, to construct and operate a green hydrogen solar plant. “This is the first project of its kind planned in Central Africa,” claimed HDF Energy. It said it is considering a location in the southern part of the country.

Silicon carbide-based inverters are known to have higher power densities, with less need for cooling and lower overall system costs than traditional inverters. However, defects at the interface between the silicon carbide and the insulating silicon dioxide material could still represent an issue for such devices.
“Navitas’ GeneSiC power devices, based on trench-assisted planar-gate SiC MOSFET technology, can operate at high temperatures and high speeds, resulting in up to 25 C lower case temperature and up to [three times] longer life than competing SiC products,” the two companies said in a joint statement. “Due to their documented 100% proven avalanche capability, 30% longer short-circuit withstand time, and consistent threshold voltage for simple paralleling, GeneSiC MOSFETs are suitable for high-power and fast time-to-market applications.”
The German PV inverter manufacturer said that the 4.6 kW coolcept fleX inverter now includes 16 SiC MOSFETs of the model GeneSiC G3R75MT12.
“These 1,200 V, 75 mΩ-rated devices are arranged in a two-level converter with bi-directional boost converters and an H4-topology for AC voltage output,” said the company.
The product sheet shows that the coolcept fleX products without SiC semiconductors have an efficiency of 98.0% and European efficiencies ranging from 97.0% to 98.0%. They measure 399 mm x 657 mm x 222 mm and weigh 12 kg. They feature single MPP trackers, with a maximum input power of 6.1 kW per tracker.
The maximum input voltage is 1,000 V and the MPP voltage range is between 250 V and 800 V. The system also features an IP65-rated protection and a cooling system based on a controlled fan.
“By reducing the size and weight of passive components due to increased switching frequency, the Katek unit outperforms older silicon-based inverters in terms of size and weight,” the manufacturer said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/31/silver-alloyed-cgis-solar-cell-with-18-7-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWITZERLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 31, 2023",Silver-alloyed CGIS solar cell with 18.7% efficiency,"Scientists from Switzerland’s Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) have built a thin-film solar cell based on copper, gallium, indium and selenium (CIGS) by using a small amount of silver (Ag) to alloy the CGIS absorber. They claim the device can be used for applications in tandem solar cells.
“The amount of Ag in CIGS is very tiny; only about 20nm or thinner Ag precursor layer for a total CIGS thickness of about 3000 nm,” researcher Maximilian Krause told pv magazine. “But the benefits in terms of structural and electronic properties to enhance the photovoltaic conversion efficiency are high.”
The researchers said the use of silver improves grain growth and crystal quality, while reducing detrimental defects and compensating for the low bandgap energy of 1.0 eV of the CIGS absorber. The researchers used a precursor layer method to deposit Ag on the absorber, in a three-stage co-evaporation process on soda-lime glass.
“The absorbers were completed by a 35nm cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer deposited in a chemical bath,” they explained. “The solar cells did not undergo a heat-light soaking.”
They built a cell with a surface of 0.57 cm2 and an antireflective coating based on magnesium fluoride (MgF2). Tested under standard illumination conditions, the best-performing device showed a power conversion efficiency of 18.7%, an open-circuit voltage of 602 mV, a short-circuit current of 42.1 mAcm-2, and a fill factor of 73.9%.
“While Ag leads to higher open-circuit voltage and fill factor values, the short-circuit current does not reveal similar trends,” they said.
The academics said the increase in performance may be due to the fact that Ag-alloying modifies the cell interface as it consists of a bi-layer structure with a rubidium, indium, selenium (Rb-In-Se) layer and a Cu-depleted ordered vacancy compound OVC layer, which reduce the density of interfacial defects and act like passivation layers.
They described the cell technology, which they claim can be used for applications in tandem solar cells, in “Silver-alloyed low bandgap CuInSe2 solar cells for tandem applications,” which was recently published in RRL Solar.
“Up to now, we have not yet calculated the extra costs, but benefits could be significant when one considers the implication on industrial-level productions,” Krause said, when asked about the cell's production costs. “Our lab is very interested in further developments of technology and towards industrialization.”

The numbers are based on provisional statistics from the country's four grid operators – Stedin, Liander, Enexis, and Westland Infra. If confirmed, the increase in installed solar capacity could represent year-on-year growth of up to 40%.
Stedin has reported that 107.264 PV systems, or 484 MW, were installed in its service area in 2022, which includes the provinces of Utrecht, Zeeland, and South Holland. The cumulative residential PV capacity of this area hit 1.69 GW at the end of December.
Liander said 153.422 new residential solar arrays, or 699 MW, were deployed in its service area last year, up 25% from 2021. Westland Infra, meanwhile, said that around 19.000 small-sized rooftop PV installations, or 79 MW. were installed in its service area. Enexis said 192,133 residential customers installed solar panels in 2022, but it did not provide installed capacity figures.
“The net metering scheme is an important driver of the popularity of solar panels among homeowners,” Netbeheer Nederland said in a statement. “Since 2004, this scheme has led to unprecedented rapid growth in the number of solar panels on the roofs of homes.”
The Netherlands deployed 1,946 MW of new PV systems in the first half of 2022, according to official statistics from CBS, the nation’s statistics agency.
“By mid-2022, 1.92 million PV installations were connected to the grid in the country, the majority of which can be found on homes,” Dutch solar analyst Peter Segaar told pv magazine. “The provisional figures also indicate that one-fifth of the total number of homes in the Netherlands already had a PV system on the roof at the end of 2021.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/31/retired-coal-sites-to-host-multi-day-iron-air-batteries/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 31, 2023",Retired coal sites to host multi-day iron-air batteries,"From pv magazine USA
Solar and wind power have variability in their productive hours, as multi-day weather events can impact output. Therefore, multi-day storage that is cost effective is important in grid reliability.
This is the logic that supported the creation of Boston startup Form Energy’s iron-air batteries. The grid-scale batteries can store intermittent renewables-sourced electricity for 100 hours at costs competitive with conventional power plants.
Utility Xcel Energy said it will install two 10 MW/1,000 MWh iron-air batteries – one at a retired coal plant in Minnesota and another on a restored site in Colorado. The projects are expected to go online in 2025, following regulatory approval.
The iron-air battery is composed of cells filled with thousands of iron pellets that are exposed to air, creating rust. The oxygen is then removed, reverting the rust to iron. Controlling this process allows the battery to be charged and discharged.
The technology is less energy-dense than its lithium-ion counterparts, making it a better fit for large grid-scale applications. This may come as an advantage for the company, as EV batteries are in competition for lithium, a metal with geo-political mining concerns and battery fire risks.
“Form was founded with a unified mission to develop a multi-day energy storage battery that would unlock the power of extremely low-cost renewable energy to transform the electric grid,” said Mateo Jaramillo, co-founder and chief executive officer of Form Energy.
Form Energy said an individual battery module is about the size of a side-by-side washer/dryer set and contains a stack of approximately 50 one-meter-tall cells. The cells include iron and air electrodes, the parts of the battery that enable the electrochemical reactions to store and discharge electricity. Each of these cells are filled with water-based, non-flammable electrolyte, like the electrolyte used in AA batteries.
These battery modules are grouped together in environmentally protected enclosures. Hundreds of these enclosures are grouped together in modular megawatt-scale power blocks. Depending on the system size, tens to hundreds of these power blocks can be connected to the electricity grid. For scale, in its least dense configuration, a one-megawatt system comprises half an acre of land. Higher density configurations would achieve >3 mw/acre.
“We’re on track to reduce our electric system carbon emissions 80% by 2030 and to deliver carbon-free electricity by 2050,” said Bob Frenzel, chief executive officer of Xcel Energy. “As we build more renewable energy into our systems, our partnership with Form Energy opens the door to significantly improve how we deliver carbon-free energy.”
Form Energy held a $200 million Series D funding round in 2021 led by ArcelorMittal and a $450 million Series E round led by TPG Rise Climate, and numerous Canada-based funds.
In December, it announced a West Virginia-based manufacturing facility. Emerging from startup mode, Form expects to begin construction of its Weirton factory in 2023 and start manufacturing iron-air batteries in 2024 for broad commercialization.
The governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, said that the state was able to structure a unique financial incentive package worth up to $290 million in asset-based, performance financing to support their decision to locate in Weirton. The West Virginia Economic Development Authority allocated $75 million toward the purchase of land and the construction of buildings in Weirton. The governor said he plans on working with the West Virginia Legislature and federal partners to obtain an additional $215 million needed to finalize the agreement.
The Xcel collaboration was modeled using Form Energy’s investment and operational modeling tool for grids, called Formware. This modeling helped Xcel Energy validate how Form’s multi-day storage will support Xcel Energy’s ability to reliably and cost-effectively integrate large amounts of wind energy and other renewable resources on its system.
Additionally, this analysis demonstrated how the 100-hour iron-air battery technology will strengthen the grid against normal day-to-day, week-to-week, and season-to-season weather variability, in addition to extreme weather events including severe winter storms and polar vortex events.
“Xcel Energy operates across some of the richest wind-resource areas in North America,” said Jaramillo. “This partnership highlights Xcel Energy’s commitment to ensuring grid resiliency and reliability, energy security, and access to low-cost clean energy when and where it is needed – every day of the year.”

University of Adelaide researchers have led an international team to the discovery of a method under which water straight from the ocean can be used in a commercial electrolyzer to efficiently produce green hydrogen.
“We used seawater as a feedstock without the need for any pre-treatment processes like reverse osmosis desolation, purification, or alkalisation,” said Associate Professor Yao Zheng, from the University of Adelaide’s School of Chemical Engineering.
The team simply filtered the seawater, which came from the Huanghai Sea in China, to remove solids and microorganisms.
“The performance of a commercial electrolyser with our catalysts running in seawater is close to the performance of platinum/iridium catalysts running in a feedstock of highly purified deionised water,” said Zheng.
The discovery addresses concerns about water scarcity that have lingered around green hydrogen discussions. The researchers have described the ocean as an “almost infinite resource,” accounting for 96.5% of the earth’s water reserves, but it has proven challenging due to the complexities of the water profile. The team’s solution boils down to adjusting the local reaction environment of the catalyst.
The team consists of researchers from China’s Tianjin University and Nankai University, as well as Kent State University in the United States. They published their research in Nature Energy this week.
