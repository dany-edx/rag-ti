Solar cells manufactured from GaAs and gallium indium phosphide (GaInP) have long yielded some of the highest conversion efficiencies of any technology. Bringing down production costs to make them viable for mainstream solar applications remains a challenge, despite recent scientific suggestions for various approaches to using GaAs and other III-V materials in solar devices.
The scientists said the novelty of their approach consisted of using dynamic hydride vapor phase epitaxy (D-HVPE), as an alternative lower-cost solution to metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE), to synthesize the solar cell. HVPE, on the other hand, uses low-cost elemental group III precursors with high utilization efficiency and very high growth rates.
They also applied an emitter layer of gallium indium arsenide phosphide (GaInAsP), which makes the cell's heterojunction together with the GaAs absorber.
“For processing, a reflective Au metal contact was electroplated onto the AlGaAs contact layer, and then samples were inverted onto a Si handle, and the substrate was etched away followed by the etch stop,” they explained.
The academics identified an optimum emitter doping density and energy bandgap to maximize the cell efficiency, and said that the size of this varies with the heteroband offsets, as defined by the material choice.
NREL’s Cell and Module Performance (CMP) Team has certified that the novel cell design achieved a power conversion efficiency of more than 27%. The researchers said this is the highest efficiency ever reported for a single-junction GaAs cell grown using this technique.

They presented the cell in “Modeling and design of III-V heterojunction solar cells for enhanced performance,” which was recently published in Cell Reports Physical Science.
“We also show that heterojunctions yield proportionally larger efficiency improvements in lower-quality materials,” they concluded. “Although the modeling was developed and validated using III-V materials, the results are theoretically applicable to materials systems outside III-Vs.”

Green Gravity and Romanian government-backed energy company Complexul Energetic Valea Jiului SA (CEVJ) have executed a cooperation framework agreement to investigate deployment opportunities for the Australian company’s energy storage technology in 17 coal mine shafts in Romania’s Jiului Valley.
The parties will assess the technical, economic and environmental aspects of converting CEVJ’s existing coal mines into energy storage facilities, using Green Gravity’s energy storage solution, which moves heavy weights vertically in legacy mine shafts to capture and release the gravitational potential energy, providing long-duration storage to the grid.
The two companies will also evaluate the potential benefits and challenges of integrating the energy storage system with the existing power grid and renewable energy sources.
Green Gravity CEO Mark Swinnerton said the agreement underpins the export potential of clean energy technology from Australia and places the company at the forefront of commercialising gravitational energy storage globally.
“Our technology offers a unique solution to store excess renewable energy using gravity, which can help balance the power grid and support the EU’s climate goals,” he said. “Successfully implementing gravitational energy storage in the Valea Jiului will provide a leading example for successful transition of a coal mining region. This project has global implications for climate, jobs and investment.”
Green Gravity’s technology harnesses the fundamental principles of gravity and kinetic energy to generate clean, dispatchable energy. The system relies on lifting and lowering ultra-heavy weights in legacy mine shafts and in doing so, turning a turbine that creates electricity.
Swinnerton said the technology “represents a breakthrough in the search for economic long-duration storage of renewable energy … By re-using mining assets, costs can be kept low. By using gravity as the fuel, we dispense with consuming the critical water, land, and chemicals which other storage technologies rely on.”
Green Gravity – based in Wollongong, New South Wales – has already struck early-stage collaboration deals with the likes of Australian coal producer Yancoal and international engineering heavyweight GHD.
CEVJ Managing Director Eusebiu Durbaca said in a statement that the collaboration with Green Gravity has the potential to transform Romania’s coal sector into a renewable energy storage hub as the country shifts from fossil fuels to renewables.
Romania is aiming to increase the share of renewable energy in its energy mix and reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, targeting 30.5% renewables by 2030 and committing to phasing out coal by 2032.
“This project is part of our strategy to diversify our energy portfolio and explore new opportunities for value creation from our coal assets,” Durbaca said. “We believe that gravitational energy storage is an innovative approach to energy transition, and we are committed to contributing to Romania’s and Europe’s energy transition and green recovery.”

The Munich-based gas and electricity brokerage firm unveiled the digital platform and mobile phone app on Tuesday. According to a press release, the platform aims to expedite the purchasing and leasing processes of home energy systems, such as PV.
Teleson claims the platform will save time for its 4,000 energy consultants, partners, and their customers, when compared to traditional retail methods.
“The new sales platform and app supports energy consultants in planning PV projects and enables contracts to be signed within 48 hours,” a Teleson spokesperson told pv magazine. The spokesperson said the app will help consultants overcome traditional PV-sales “hurdles” by making the planning process as detailed and efficient as possible.
The program works by users entering details specific to their homes – spanning location, residence and rooftop types – and product preferences – such as modules, energy storage systems or wall boxes. Based on this information, the Teleson PV platform then displays options for users to consider with their energy advisors. The app then offers a binding and ready-to-sign contract.
Teleson PV also includes a return-on-investment calculator, which shows convincing arguments for switching to solar power, the press release says. This includes account savings over 20 years based on a variety of price and usage scenarios.
Teleson's PV portfolio currently includes six products and service suppliers, including Hanwha Q-Cells, HeimWatt, GreenRock Energy and Sunvigo. More PV products and service partners will be added over time, the announcement said.

Brazilian energy supplier Comerc Energia has inaugurated the 662 MW Hélio Valgas Solar Complex, which is located in Várzea da Palma, in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. According to the country's Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME), the facility is the fifth-largest PV plant in Brazil.
The construction required an investment of BRL 2 billion ($405.2 million). The complex will sell “almost all” of the electricity it will produce to Liasa, a state-owned manufacturer of silicon metal, under a long-term PPA.
The Hélio Valgas plant is installed on an area of 1,154 hectares – the equivalent of 1,650 football fields. At present, Brazil's largest solar plant is the Janaúba Solar Complex, with 1.2 GW of capacity. In the state of Piauí, Italian utility Enel operates the São Gonçalo complex, with 864 MW of installed capacity. In July, mining giant Vale inaugurated a 766 MW complex in Minas Gerais, which will supply 16% of its energy.
All in all, the country has 10 GW of installed large-scale PV capacity and another 131 GW of projects authorized by the Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (Aneel) as of July 2023.
The states of Minas Gerais, Bahia, and Piauí are the leaders in installed capacity, with 3.1 GW, 2 GW, and 1.4 GW, respectively. They also lead in authorized projects, with 41.7 GW, 23.8 GW, and 17.1 GW of planned pipeline installations, respectively.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/10/open-source-workflow-to-assess-rooftop-pv-potential/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,EUROPE,GERMANY,WESTERN EUROPE",LIOR KAHANA,"NOVEMBER 10, 2023",Open-source workflow to assess rooftop PV potential,"Researchers from Forschungszentrum Jülich and RWTH Aachen University in Germany have developed an open-source workflow for rooftop PV potential assessments from satellite imagery.
The new ETHOS.PASSION workflow can assess a given region's geographical, technical, and economic potential, as well as surface area, orientation, and the slopes of individual rooftop sections.
“ETHOS.PASSION also includes the detection of superstructures, i.e., obstacles such as windows or existing photovoltaic installations,” the scientists said. “The novel two-look approach combines two deep learning models identifying rooftops and sections, and an additional model for identifying superstructures.”
The workflow considers rooftop segmentation, section segmentation, and superstructure segmentation – all trained under U-Net architecture, which is an architecture that was first used for biomedical image segmentation and is now used for semantic segmentation. It relies on machine learning to separate images into meaningful parts.
Programmed rooftop segmentation identifies roofs, section segmentation determines azimuth, and superstructure segmentation filters out unrelated obstacles. Rooftop and section segmentation are trained on INRIA and RID datasets, with INRIA being satellite images from the United States and Austria at 30 cm/pixel resolution, and RID containing semantic labels of roof segments and superstructures.

“Both the INRIA dataset for the rooftop segmentation and the RID dataset for the section and superstructure segmentations were split into 80%, 10%, and 10% for training, validation, and test sets,” the academics explained. After using some additional algorithms, the workflow's final output is the potential panel layout in the region. Based on this, technical and economic potentials can be further calculated.
The research group also used Intersection over Union (IoU), a common evaluation metric for image segmentation in computer vision. The IoU measures the percentage of overlap between the actual data and the prediction output.
They achieved IoUs of 0.8478 for rooftop segmentation, 0.7531 for section segmentation, and 0.4927 for superstructure segmentation on the test sets.
“There is a set of limitations to the current state of the project,” the researchers said. “Perhaps most importantly, the model results in the wild are in some cases not very accurate. Results are expected to be more accurate in larger regions, where errors in specific buildings are balanced out.”
In addition to introducing the novel workflow, the article proposed a conceptual frame of reference to compare different PV potential models. Their framework provides an implementation-independent point of reference that reduces ambiguity in academic information exchange and increases the comparability of methods, software, and data.
“The assessment of rooftop PV potential has become increasingly accurate due to the expanding availability of satellite imagery and improvements in computer vision methods. However, the analysis of satellite imagery is impeded by a lack of transparency, reproducibility, and standardized description of the methods employed,” the academics said.
They presented the new tool in “ETHOS.PASSION: An open-source workflow for rooftop photovoltaic potential assessments from satellite imagery,” which was recently published in Solar Energy.

“Although better than expected performance for vertical installation of bifacial PV has been reported at conferences and workshops, we haven’t seen any publications that show that this is accompanied with a much lower operating temperature than you would expect for free-standing fixed tilt PV with the same total irradiance,” the research's corresponding author, Bas B. Van Aken, told pv magazine. “These lower operating temperatures have a positive effect on the operating voltage. And thereby on the total energy generation, particularly under high irradiance conditions.”
In the study “Thermal model in digital twin of vertical PV system helps to explain unexpected yield gains,” published in EPJ Photovoltaics, Van Aken and his colleagues explained that the voltage is influenced both by the amount of light and by the temperature of the solar cells. With increasing irradiance conditions, the voltage increases logarithmically, while with increasing temperature, the voltage decreases, typically by 0.3-0.4% per C.
“For a standard system, we observed that under high irradiance conditions, the increase due to the light is offset by the decrease due to the higher operating temperature,” Van Aken stressed. “However, for the vertical system, we observed that the operating temperature is not increasing so much and the voltage increase and decrease are more or less balancing.”
For its modeling, the group used digital twins, which are virtual representations that connect and visualize real-world assets, to create twins consisting of a real PV system and a copy in digital format. Digital twins are commonly used for operation and maintenance (O&M) of solar power plants. “The digital version mimics the output of the PV panels based on the time series of weather and other environmental data. The simulated values are compared to observed data,” the scientists explained.
They took their measurements in a vertical PV system located near the TNO facilities in Petten, the Netherlands. The east-west system features nine rows each equipped with eight 315 W bifacial modules, with the spacing between module rows being 2 m, 4 m, or 6 m, respectively. Of the 72 modules deployed in the system, 60 rely on n-type M2 TOPCon solar cells. All of the panels are equipped with power optimizers provided by Israel-based Solaredge.
For its analysis, the group utilized an in-house developed extraction method and found that the heat transfer coefficients of the vertical panels are nearly double the values of the horizontal panels. Heat transfer coefficients define how heat energy passes from one material to another and are commonly used, for example, to make insulation in homes.
They also ascertained that the vertical array operates at a temperature difference with respect to ambient that is “nearly halved,” which they said results in a 2.5% higher annual energy yield.
“These results show the importance of checking the actual operating conditions of emerging applications of solar panels,” Van Aken concluded. “We expect that this effect has a 2-3% increase in annual electricity yield in the Netherlands, the lower operating temperature has a slowing effect on degradation mechanisms and the effect could be more significant in locations with higher irradiance conditions.”

While the wafer market remains sluggish, this week’s price drop was less dramatic than it was in the prior two weeks. This is because wafer prices are projected to bottom out soon, a source upstream said.

Even if polysilicon in China is priced at CNY50 ($6.86)/kg, the cost of M10 wafers made by major manufacturers would still be a little over CNY2/pc, according to a polysilicon seller. A CNY2/pc selling price won’t be reached until the price of high-purity quartz crucibles also plummets, he added, concluding therefore that the bottom selling price for M10 wafers could be around CNY2.1/pc and CNY2.2/pc.
The price difference between wafers offered by major producers and the rest is narrowing. Large and small producers alike have reduced M10 wafer prices to between CNY2.3/pc and CNY2.4/pc, after a Tier-2 wafer manufacturer took the initiative to cut prices, according to a veteran market observer.
Wafer companies are no longer profitable given the present pricing of polysilicon, a developer said. OPIS assessed that China polysilicon prices fell almost 5% to CNY65.875/kg this week. To minimize losses, wafer businesses would rather cut production output further than sell wafers at a significant loss, suggesting that wafer manufacturers are no longer able to afford additional price reductions, the source added.
The only encouraging news in the wafer market is that China polysilicon prices are currently falling more than wafer prices, which could help wafer makers make up for some of their losses, according to a downstream source. An end to the downtrend in wafer prices is within reach as polysilicon prices approach their cash cost, the source added.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

Ind-Ra has maintained a “stable” outlook for solar projects and a “negative” outlook on wind projects in fiscal 2024, from April 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024.
It said that solar projects maintain stability, with adequate debt coverage and improved liquidity, while falling module prices benefit under-construction projects. However, it added that timely project completion is critical due to the slowdown in yearly capacity additions in the first half of fiscal 2024.
Ind-Ra said India installed 5 GW of solar capacity and 1.6 GW of wind in the first half of fiscal 2024, from 6.8 GW of solar and 1.3 GW of wind in the first half of fiscal 2023. Capacity additions for all of fiscal 2023 hit 12.8 GW solar and 2.3 GW wind.
Wind projects continue to be marred by generation variability, said Ind-Ra. It expects wind generation in fiscal 2024 to be similar to the preceding year. The elimination of reverse auctions will probably allow developers to bid with better risk-return profiles, supporting capacity additions over the medium term, according to Ind-Ra.

Solcast analyzed data, via the Solcast API, and found that parts of Italy, Ukraine and Scandinavia saw over 130% of average October irradiance levels despite four large storms that month. The Iberian Peninsula and the land between northern Germany and Poland were hardest hit by storms and saw average or lower irradiance.
October began with clear skies and higher temperatures attributed to a robust high-pressure system over the Alps. The system blocked oceanic moisture from spreading across the continent. In southern Europe, especially around the Black Sea, persistent sunshine led to high irradiance levels. Solar assets from Greece to Ukraine would have recorded an increase of 120% in irradiance levels compared to the typical October average.
Later in the month, low-pressure systems brought clouds and rain across northern Europe. This resulted in lower or average irradiance levels, also moderating the otherwise above-average temperatures. The effects of Storm Babet – which cost the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands over 422 GWh of solar generation – can be seen from the United Kingdom’s east coast to Poland.

The Scandinavian peninsula received much higher irradiance than normal as the low-pressure systems moved farther south than normal, as seen above in the average deviation map. This shifted prevailing winds more north-easterly, bringing colder and drier air masses. This area received less total irradiance than the rest of the continent, as seen below, but many areas across Finland, Sweden and Norway were well above (130%) of the local long-term October average. This was the only Europen area that experienced lower-than-average monthly surface temperatures.

Despite the month's sunny start, solar assets on the Iberian Peninsula's west coast were hit hard by all four major storms in October. Portugal bore the brunt of these storms blowing in from the Atlantic, with just 80% of average October irradiance.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1 km to 2 km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with a typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets globally.

Residential solar has been navigating difficult waters over the past year, as high interest rates squeeze the savings made available to homeowners. Policy changes, like net energy metering (NEM) 3.0 in California, are pressuring the value proposition to rooftop solar customers, crushing demand in recent months.  
Major publicly traded solar stocks are down over 75% over the past year, and demand in major markets like California has peeled back 40% to 80%, with the damage from NEM 3.0 not fully evaluated yet. 
While California has long served as a model for solar success, that may no longer hold true. In its Roundtables US 2023 live event, pv magazine USA invited a panel of four distributed solar and energy storage experts to offer their view of how the market is responding to policy changes and offered some lessons from California’s recent struggles. 
The participants included Aurora Solar Chief Revenue Officer Carina Brockl, Sonnen Chairman and CEO Blake Richetta, Sunrun Vice President Of Public Policy Walker Wright, and California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) Executive Director Bernadette del Chiaro.
Wright began the conversation acknowledging that net metering was instrumental in kickstarting the market in California, which represents roughly 50% of the United States rooftop solar market. It, along with federal policy and California state incentives, was what made rooftop solar such a strong customer value proposition. 
“The largest renewable energy market in California is distributed [solar],” said del Chiaro. “And yet what we have just done is not just a seismic shift  … we are looking at an 80% drop in sales under the new NBT tariff. The months ahead are looking dimmer, not brighter.” 
While residential solar is currently being hammered by headwinds, there are some forces that could counteract the market retraction. Brockl said though inflation has increased steadily, electricity prices have increased even more, and in some cases at double the rate of inflation. This makes the customer proposition to rooftop solar customers slightly more appealing as a hedge to rising utility rates, even if day one savings are razor-thin or even in the negative. 
Richetta, representing energy storage provider Sonnen, expressed more optimism than his fellow panelists. Sonnen has its roots in Germany, which experienced a similar market contraction in rooftop solar when it phased out its feed-in tariff policy that supported the creation of the market. Since then, the market has recovered, and Germany has among the highest rooftop solar penetration rates in the world. 
“There was a market need to harness solar and harmonize it with grid operations… and to transform an intermittent form of generation to something that is firm and dispatchable,” said Richetta.

The US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon is an international collegiate competition that for more than two decades has challenged more than 25,000 students to create efficient, affordable buildings powered by renewable energy. It promotes student innovation, cross-disciplinary education, and real-world training for a variety of careers.
The first Solar Decathlon competition was held on the National Mall in Washington, DC, in the fall of 2002. Fourteen teams designed, built, transported, and showcased zero-energy houses powered entirely by renewable energy – a feat relatively unheard of at the time. During the 21-day inaugural event, more than 100,000 people visited the first-ever Solar Decathlon.
After the initial US events, the Solar Decathlon expanded to  Europe, China, Latin America, Africa, India, and the Middle East. It has grown to include both residential and commercial buildings through Design and Build Challenges.
Students competing in the Solar Decathlon Design Challenge work in interdisciplinary teams to create high-performance building designs that aim to solve problems related to climate change, affordability and environmental justice.
Teams spend one or two academic semesters collaborating on a residential or commercial design project that they enter in the competition event held in April. The event offers the teams an opportunity to present designs to expert jurors, network and build connections with industry professionals.
The winner of the 2022 Design Challenge, residential category, was Georgia Institute of Technology’s retrofit design for a single-family home. The home is located in a diverse neighborhood, and the team focused the retrofit  on environmental sustainability, social equity and economic efficiency. The 102-year old house was in bad shape, so the team redesigned the existing layout to make it more flexible and they improved the roof, windows and designed for cross ventilation in the summer and heat gain in the winter.
The design included an HVAC system that included an energy recovery ventilator and ducted mini-split heat pumps, with electricity provided by a rooftop PV system. The result was efficient daylighting, reduced maintenance, appliance efficiency, privacy and security, in addition to overall energy savings.

“Creating affordable, energy-efficient solutions for buildings nationwide is key to the United States meeting its decarbonization goals,” said Holly Jamesen Carr, director of the Solar Decathlon. “Hundreds of students from around the world are set to meet this challenge head-on this year as they participate in DOE’s longest-running collegiate competition.”
See the list of 105 teams from 93 collegiate institutions. This year’s teams represent 18 countries and 29 US states, with 26 new collegiate institutions and 67 returning institutions.
As part of the Design Challenge, students will create designs for new or existing buildings in one of four categories: single-family housing, attached housing, multifamily building, or education building.
Winning teams are recognized with awards on an international stage and winning design projects are shared through Solar Decathlon and U.S. Department of Energy channels. The students gain marketable design skills as a result of their participation and industry partners and sponsors gain recognition while supporting the next generation of clean energy design professionals.

The teams selected to participate in the 2024 competition have until February 2024 to come up with a design to be entered in the semifinal competition. Those that move to the next stage participate in the final competition held April 19 through April 24, 2024, hosted at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, with virtual participation options available.
