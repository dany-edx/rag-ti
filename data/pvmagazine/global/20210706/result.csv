Having signed, in November 2019, a joint agreement with the developer to install 400 MW of clean power generation capacity in Armenia, the authorities in Yerevan were so unimpressed with Masdar's suggestion of a $0.0299/kWh price for the power generated by the first project envisioned, that they put the bid out to tender. Masdar was, however, given the opportunity of undercutting the lowest bid produced by the tender by at least $0.001/kWh in order to land the deal.
Masdar, a subsidiary of UAE sovereign wealth fund the Mubadala Investment Company, has won the contract, it was announced today, but it will have to settle for $0.0290/kWh, with a joint press release issued by the two parties stating: “Further discussions are under way on the development of the remaining 200 MW” agreed in the joint development declaration.
Masdar and the Armenian National Interest Fund CJSC state entity which will hold a 15% stake in the solar park, today said the $174 million project will span more than 500ha in the Talin and Dashtadem communities, will involve construction of a new electricity substation, and will create “numerous direct and indirect jobs.”
The project was described by Masdar CEO Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi as “Armenia’s biggest utility scale solar project,” and by David Papazian, his peer at the Armenian state body, as “by far the largest single foreign investment in green energy in the region, and the second largest foreign direct investment in the history of modern Armenia.”

The investment will give Ineos the right to appoint a non-executive director to the board.
“Our experience in storage and handling of hydrogen, combined with our established knowhow in electrolysis technology, puts us in a unique position to drive progress towards a carbon-free future based on hydrogen,” said Ineos chairman Brian Gilvary in a note released yesterday.
The HydrogenOne fund, established 14 months ago by an analyst and an engineer, is expected to invest in mainly private assets and has already identified 36 potential opportunities. Ineos is, reportedly, Europe’s largest electrolysis operator and hydrogen producer, and makes around 400,000 tons of the gas annually, mainly as a co-product from its chemical manufacturing. The U.K. government wants 5 GW of ‘low-carbon hydrogen' production by 2030.
Stefano Geuna, rector of the University of Turin, and Guido Saracco, his peer at the city's polytechnic, have agreed to cooperate on hydrogen. Research is under way to identify sites for the storage of large quantities of the fuel, and to prove the economic rationale of the large-scale use of hydrogen for the seasonal storage of renewable energy – referred to as ‘power-to-power' or ‘P2P'.
“The use of hydrogen in energy storage systems for large sizes and long durations (power-to-power or P2P systems) is one of the most interesting prospects of use at the international level,” stated a press release about the cooperation agreement, released yesterday. “The REMOTE project, funded by Horizon2020 [an EU research fund] and coordinated by the Politecnico di Torino, and conducted together with 10 European partners, aims to demonstrate the economic and technical sustainability of energy storage systems.”
The EU-funded ‘remote-area energy supply with multiple options for integrated, hydrogen-based technologies' (REMOTE) project, aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of two fuel-cell based hydrogen energy storage systems for use in off-grid areas.
Meanwhile, Italian politicians are discussing whether to adopt additional measures to support green hydrogen but have not found common ground to date.
Energy company Shell has started its 10 MW polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) hydrogen electrolysis plant at the Wesseling site of its Rheinland refinery, near Cologne. The plant, which opened last week after a two-year construction project, is the largest of its kind in Europe. “As part of the Refhyne European consortium, and with European Commission funding through the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU), the fully operational plant is the first to use this technology at such a large scale in a refinery,” stated a note released by Shell on Friday.
 
Shell, which has laid plans to expand the electrolyzer's capacity to 100 MW and said a ‘Refhyne II' facility could be ready in 2024, also plans to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using renewable energy and biomass at the site. “Shell wants to become a leading supplier of green hydrogen for industrial and transport customers in Germany,” said the Anglo-Dutch company's downstream director, Huibert Vigeveno. “We will be involved in the whole process, from power generation, using offshore wind, to hydrogen production and distribution across sectors.”
The consortium behind the project also includes U.K.-based PEM electrolyzer manufacturer ITM Power, Norwegian state-owned research institute SINTEF, and two consultants: Chicago-based Sphera, and Element Energy, which is based in Cambridge, England.
The electrolyzer was made in Sheffield, England, and includes components from Italy, Sweden, Spain and Germany.
“Today, 30% of German demand for hydrogen already comes from North Rhine-Westphalia's industry. Estimates predict that demand will double by 2030,” said the state's minister-president Armin Laschet, who is also hotly tipped to be Germany's next chancellor, after September's election.
The Enova funding agency owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment, on Friday announced its support for Hydrogenious LOHC Maritime, a joint venture set up by Norwegian offshore vessel operator Johannes Østensjø, and Germany’s Hydrogenious LOHC Technologies. Enova will provide NOK26 million (€2.55 million) for the JV's initial ‘HyNjord' project.
“The aim is to develop and market emission-free liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC)-based applications for shipping, having a commercial product ready for operation from 2025,” said a note on Friday. The joint venture is focused on on-board LOHC and fuel cell propulsion systems on a megawatt scale. “German-based Hydrogenious LOHC Technology GmbH has developed and patented the LOHC technology for … particularly safe, easy and efficient storage and transportation of hydrogen, which will revolutionize the supply chain for hydrogen,” added the note.
Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin, and minister of trade and industry Denis Manturov, attended the Innoprom 2021 International Industrial Trade Fair in Yekaterinburg yesterday. “We toured the fair and the stands dedicated to hydrogen energy and robotics, and saw products developed by enterprises from the Sverdlovsk region, the Rostec Corporation, the Almaz-Antey Concern and many other companies,” said Mishustin. “We have things to offer to our international partners.”

The RMB12 billion (US$1.86 billion) development, which will include 500 MW of wind capacity will be developed in phases “according to … policies and business indicators,” said the power investment arm of solar manufacturer Jinko.
Diamond-wire cutting equipment supplier Gaoce Technology yesterday announced an intent to invest in monocrystalline wafer production in Yancheng City, in Jiangsu province. Gaoce, which said it had reached agreement with the local authority, wants to establish 10 GW of annual wafer making capacity through a RMB1 billion (US$155 million) factory in the city's high-tech zone, with construction of the 40,000m2 building expected next year. The plan is yet to be approved by the board of Shanghai-listed Gaoce, however.
China Energy Engineering yesterday announced it and three unnamed companies have signed an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract with fellow state-owned entity Three Gorges New Energy Siziwangqi Co Ltd, to develop a hybrid renewable demonstration project. The Three Gorges Ulanqab New Generation Grid-friendly Green Power Station Demonstration project will feature 75 MW of solar capacity in its first phase, alongside 425 MW of wind capacity and “140 MW/2 hours energy storage,” China Energy said in an update to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Phase two will feature 125 MW of solar, 625 MW wind and “220 MW/2 hours” storage and phase three, 100 MW of photovoltaics, 650 MW of wind and “190 MW/2” hours’ storage. No timeline was given for the project, at Ulanqab City, Inner Mongolia, with China Energy stating the entire EPC contract would be worth RMB10 billion.
Polysilicon manufacturer GCL yesterday continued the solar project capacity sell-off by its New Energy developer arm by selling a 50 MW plant to State Power Investment Corporation subsidiary Guizhou West Power Construction Co Ltd. With a sale price of RMB43.1 million (US$6.67 million) and total net proceeds of RMB306 million (US$47.3 million), GCL is anticipating to book a RMB35.6 million net gain on the deal, which will also remove a further RMB30 million of liabilities from its books.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/06/renewables-powered-island-can-be-an-outlier-for-the-greek-archipelago/,"COMMUNITY,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MINIGRID,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,GREECE",ILIAS TSAGAS,"JULY 6, 2021",Renewables powered island can be an outlier for the Greek archipelago,"Greece’s Ministry of the Environment and Energy has signed a memorandum of understanding for a project it hopes will kick-start the effort to power its small islands with green energy.
The Halki project is part of a national strategy to replace island diesel power generation by either linking territories to the mainland grid or establishing green energy communities. 
The small island of Halki, in the southeastern Aegean, near Rhodes, has a permanent population of around 500 and is powered mainly by diesel generators installed on its larger neighbor.
With neither Rhodes nor Halki connected to the mainland grid, the agreement signed in Athens on Friday will establish a 1 MW solar farm to generate the latter's electricity.
Halki will also receive electric vehicles (EVs), charging points and a 5G telecommunications network under the plan, with all the infrastructure provided for free.
Alexandra Sdoukou, secretary general for energy and mineral resources at the ministry, told pv magazine state-owned electric utility the Public Power Corporation will donate the solar panels and inverters, as well as five EV chargers.
French company Akuo Energy and British-owned Omexom will develop the project by carrying out work from licensing to building and operating it. The companies will also improve Halki’s street lighting.
Vodafone Greece will install the 5G network and has plans to add solar mobile phone chargers on the island.
The ALD Automotive France fleet management and vehicle leasing company owned by investment bank Société Générale, and the Greek dealer which distributes Citroen cars in the country, will donate EVs to the Halki municipality and police and coast guard service. Residents will be offered discounts on EVs too, under the plan.
Ownership of the solar farm, municipal EVs and 5G network will pass to the new energy community comprised of the local authority and residents, said secretary-general Sdoukou, who suggested the donations by the private companies could be in line with their corporate responsibility programs and/or to raise brand awareness.
The 1 MW solar project, designed in line with the island's generation requirements, will operate under Greece's virtual net metering program, which enables bodies such as municipalities, schools and universities to generate solar power far from the points of electricity consumption.
The Halki project has been conceived as part of a wider government program to ‘green' the nation's numerous small islands.
The nearby island of Tilos has hosted a clean power mini-grid which features battery storage, for three years. Athens-headquartered Eunice Energy, which owns the mini-grid, told pv magazine the system has surpassed all expectations, making Tilos Greece’s first smart energy island.
Despite the success of the Tilos system, though, it has not been replicated elsewhere, and Sdoukou said her ministry is determined the Halki project will not be similarly ignored.
“Halki is only the beginning, it is the testbed for our new GR-Eco Islands Initiative, that aims to link the private sector to the local communities, encouraging them to work together and find common solutions that foster new technologies and low-carbon energy practices,” she said.
While the residents of Halki will go green largely free of charge, however, Sdoukou warned that may not be the case in future projects, with the energy ministry seeking to identify similar communities which would be happy to work with private sector companies to introduce community energy systems.
The secretary-general said she has been working closely with the EU’s directorate-general for regional and urban policy to develop the island initiative and the plan is to finance it via the bloc’s European Structural and Investment Funds, with the business models for island energy communities yet to emerge.
Meanwhile, Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted on Saturday that the new subsea electricity cable linking the country’s biggest island, Crete, to the mainland grid, has gone into commercial operation.
The country has already connected a number of the Cyclades Islands to the mainland grid using a subsea cable, with only one section of that project still under construction, and pv magazine has previously reported on the Crete grid link, which is said to feature the world’s longest operational subsea AC cable.
The government has said its plan to reduce diesel generation on the Greek islands can benefit all the nation's electricity consumers as the cost of diesel is shared between all customers.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/06/goodwe-founder-on-pv-inverter-trends-opportunities-and-the-key-to-business-success/,"INVERTERS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",VINCENT SHAW,"JULY 6, 2021","GoodWe founder on PV inverter trends, opportunities, and the key to business success","
Daniel Huang, founder & chairman of GoodWe: First, my motto is “focus on what really matters”. I believe in three key ingredients: product, quality, and service. If you stick to these, you will always thrive and win the trust of customers. I also believe a thorough understanding of market dynamics gives us an edge. Looking back at GoodWe’s history, we expanded our presence abroad in 2012, starting with small residential inverters. We then decided to focus more on the domestic market because I saw the opportunity in China’s residential PV sector around 2014 when talking to our international customers. We invested heavily in China’s first solar inverter academy to share knowledge and educate our customers and partners. Then, from 2016, we started getting many orders. In 2017, when the Chinese market was booming, I noticed it had become oversaturated and that’s when GoodWe began its second internationalization phase and opened offices in every corner of the world.
The first trend is that more and more string inverters are being used in PV farms, because of the many advantages they present; namely, higher efficiency, easier installation, and user-friendly operations and maintenance (O&M).
The second is the integration of PV with storage. Storage is becoming increasingly popular in all kinds of scenarios, including utility scale, commercial and industrial (C&I) distributed PV, and residential PV. We see many inverter manufacturers launching inverter products for the storage segment.
The third trend is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and intelligent energy. The combination of PV, inverters, storage, and intelligent algorithms can form an energy internet facilitating intelligent energy management.
The final is safety. As PV becomes mainstream, safety requirements are key. As Huawei is doing now, GoodWe is also exploring new technologies for increased safety such as arc fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) and rapid shutdown, etc.
We believe that in the future, PV systems will be part of an intelligent and digitalized energy system, part of an energy internet. GoodWe is committed to providing customers with products and solutions made for this future. We have established a Smart Energy Management System (SEMS) for O&M a while back and we remain just as focused now. User interface is becoming more and more practical and the overall user experience is getting better and better.
The first word that comes to my mind is “respect”. When we set up a new branch in a new country we respect and abide by local laws, regulations, and traditions. We hire local talents to work for GoodWe and we respect them and give them enough autonomy, so they can unleash their full potential. The second is contribution. We always aim to contribute to the local economy with taxes and employment opportunities. And final word is adaptation. We strive to integrate into the local culture, become a popular brand, and a respected company. That’s our focus on international marketing.
The chip shortage is a direct consequence of the digitalization of society. And my view is this trend will likely continue for the next two or three years. However, GoodWe has always good partnerships with venders including chip suppliers. Currently, we have a guaranteed chip supply, and we are not affected by this.
I wish to see GoodWe as the industry leader. That does not necessarily mean the top seller but the most respected one, the trend setter, the one with the best record in corporate social responsibility (CSR), loved and cherished by customers, employees, and shareholders. That’s my vision.
