The plan includes the transformation of the Aspach site and the construction of the green hydrogen production facility. Work on the site is expected to start in the next few months so that the production of electrolyzers to produce hydrogen can begin as early as the end of next year. This plant would be the third gigafactory for the production of electrolyzers announced in France this year, after that of Genvia, in Béziers, and that of McPhy, in Belfort. The initial production capacity of the John Cockerill project stands at 200 MW of electrolyzers per year but the site is expected to increase its manufacturing capacity to reach 1 GW in 2030.
Portugal's energy corporation, Galp Energia, plans to install a 100 MW electrolyzer to power its refinery in Sines with green hydrogen by 2025, a project which could be expanded to up to 1,000 MW, chief executive Andy Brown told Reuters on Monday. The company expects a €1 billion investment for the conversion of the refinery to green hydrogen. Galp Energia told pv magazine that the investment includes the solar power generation associated with the electrolysis.
The German and Australian governments have signed a memorandum of understanding to establish a “Germany Australia Hydrogen Accord” to enable the import into Germany of sustainably produced hydrogen in relevant quantities produced in Australia. “Among other things, we will work with German-Australian ‘hydrogen hubs' to advance the production of hydrogen on an industrial scale in Australia using German technology, and explore opportunities for cooperation under our new international funding instrument H2-Global,” Peter Altmaier, federal minister of economics and technology, commented in a press release on Monday. Australia is reportedly prepared to support this cooperation from its side with substantial financial resources. Three of the main initiatives are the co-financing of the HyGate hydrogen incubator, co-financing the industrial scale production of H2 in Australia using German technology (hydrogen hubs), and cooperation on H2 trade. “Our ambition is to produce the cheapest clean hydrogen in the world, which will transform transport, mining, resources and manufacturing at home and overseas,” Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said, in a separate statement.
The German government also announced the establishment of the H2Global Foundation, a group of 16 companies. BMWi, the ministry led by Altmaier, hailed it as “another important milestone for the international market ramp-up of green hydrogen.” Through the H2Global Foundation, green hydrogen or derivatives are purchased abroad under long-term contracts and resold in Germany via annual auctions. “Long-term purchase contracts thus create planning and investment security for industry. “The BMWi supports the instrument with approximately €900 million, in order to temporarily compensate for the difference between the purchase price of the hydrogen derivatives and the sales price in Germany, thus providing an incentive for the market ramp-up,” read a note released on Monday, adding that deliveries of the hydrogen products are expected from 2024, whereas the tendering process for green hydrogen derivatives will start this year.
A new study by the European Hydrogen Backbone initiative estimates 2,300 TWh of hydrogen demand in the EU and U.K. by 2050, corresponding to 20-25% of future EU and U.K. energy demand. “This equals about 45% of EU and U.K. natural gas consumption in 2019,” read a note released by Gas for Climate on Tuesday. The group of ten European gas transport companies wrote that the total expected hydrogen demand could potentially be met by green hydrogen produced in the EU and U.K., using renewable electricity, but that will depend on a series of factors. “Producing such quantities of green hydrogen domestically is subject to public acceptance of an accelerated expansion of renewable installed capacity, financing, regulation and quality-standard setting,” read the note, adding that “hydrogen imports by pipeline can provide an attractive complement to domestic supply.” According to Hydrogen Backbone, pipelines are the most cost-efficient option for long-distance, high-volume transport, at €0.11-0.21/kg per 1,000km, out-competing transport by ship for all reasonable distances within Europe and neighboring regions.
Jaguar Land Rover is developing a prototype hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) based on its Defender SUV, with testing scheduled to begin this year. “The FCEV concept is part of Jaguar Land Rover’s aim to achieve zero tailpipe emissions by 2036, and net zero carbon emissions across its supply chain, products and operations by 2039, in line with the Reimagine strategy announced last month,” read a note released on Tuesday.

The Tanzanian government, on 11 June, signed a €130 million loan agreement with the French Development Agency (AFD) to finance the construction of the 150 MWp solar power plant in Kishapu.
Located in the Shinyanga region in northern Tanzania, the project will be implemented in two phases, between March 2022 and March 2023.
According to the press release issued by the AFD, the project aims to increase the security of electricity supply and enable Tanzania’s state-owned power utility, the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Ltd (Tanesco), to achieve the objective of diversifying its sources of electricity and energy production with a mix of renewable energies.
It should also reduce dependence on hydropower during peak hours, as well as during the long dry season. The solar power plant will also supply with power, unspecified, adjacent gold mines in the Shinyanga region. The feasibility study for the project had already been supported by AFD, with a grant of €700,000.
Around 57% of Tanesco’s installed power generation capacity comes from 696.3 MW of thermal gas and diesel power plants, with the remaining 43% represented by 561.8 MW of hydropower. The company operates a further 52.2 MW of off-grid diesel plants.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Tanzania had an installed solar power of only 26 MW at the end of 2020. Currently, Tanzania has an access rate to electricity of around 32.7%, with approximately 7.7 million people living without power.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/15/industrial-green-hydrogen-could-become-a-global-commodity-but-local-production-is-needed-for-transport-uses/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,EUROPE,WORLD",MAX HALL,"JUNE 15, 2021",Industrial green hydrogen could become a global commodity but local production is needed for transport uses,"A fuller understanding of the cost of solar and wind-powered electricity across the globe will be necessary to help policymakers in regions with expensive electricity to plan whether to import or generate green hydrogen, according to an EU policy paper.
Staff from EU research body the Joint Research Centre (JRC) have modeled the anticipated costs of transporting green hydrogen – electrolyzed in a process powered by renewables – from parts of the world where solar and wind power is cheap to consumer markets where such prices are considerably higher.
In a policy paper published on Friday, the JRC study found the transport of 1 million tons per year of green hydrogen for industrial use, from a point of production to a single recipient 2,500km away, could be economically cheaper than generating the energy carrier in the destination market, provided the renewable electricity price at the point of origin of the hydrogen is at least €20/MWh cheaper than at the point of consumption. The economics become particularly attractive if the hydrogen is transported as a compressed gas along a dedicated pipeline, the researchers found.
However, a more complex scenario, involving the transport of just 100,000 tons per year and further dispersal to a network of hydrogen transport refueling stations within 500km, could prove more expensive than local green hydrogen production, even in markets with a high renewable electricity price, the paper stated. The fact hydrogen for transport use is more costly than the form used for industry reinforced that conclusion, although the researchers pointed out they did not consider the use of a dedicated hydrogen pipe network for such distribution, instead modeling road and rail transport for that leg of the journey.
The academics considered the transport of compressed and liquefied hydrogen as well as its conversion into chemical hydrogen carriers such as ammonia and liquid organic hydrogen carriers. Methanol was not considered as a form of hydrogen transport as it causes extensive CO2 emissions and the cost of mitigating them was considered to be more expensive than the other options studied.
Two electricity cost scenarios were considered, given the anticipated energy input required to convert the green hydrogen into an appropriate form for transport and then convert it back into its usable form at the consumer site, referred to in the paper as ‘packing' and ‘unpacking' the energy carrier. In a low-cost electricity scenario, power would cost €10/MWh at the green hydrogen production site and €50/MWh at the unpacking location. In the more expensive case, the relative costs modeled were €50 and €130/MWh, respectively. In each case, the use of green hydrogen for some energy requirements of the transport and conversion processes was considered, at a cost of €1.50/kg in the simple, industrial-use scenario and €3.50 in the case of green hydrogen for transport. The former also considered the availability of waste heat, at a cost of €20/MWh, for hydrogen packing and unpacking and the researchers added, they assumed the availability of salt caverns to store compressed hydrogen at consumption locations.
In the industrial-use model, compressed hydrogen was found to be cheapest to export, whether shipped or piped, with liquid organic hydrogen carriers almost as attractive if the €20 waste heat is available. Liquefied hydrogen transported by ship “would not be much more expensive,” stated the paper.
The researchers stressed their modeling was based on newly-installed, dedicated, long-distance hydrogen pipelines, hinting the re-purposing of the existing natural gas network could offer much bigger savings. However such infrastructure would have to be dedicated solely to hydrogen, added the paper, as blending was presumed to be unable to supply the required quantities of green hydrogen at the destination site after travelling such long distances.
The researchers found the transport part of the equation contributed much less to the total cost of moving liquid organic hydrogen carriers and ammonia, where the biggest expense is related to packing and unpacking. That opens up the possibility of much longer supply routes. With Germany having recently committed to exploring hydrogen imports from Australia, the JRC study said compressed hydrogen – especially when piped – offered the best business case up to 3,000km, making way for liquefied hydrogen and liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) over long distances, and LOHC and ammonia above 16,000km.
While liquefied hydrogen offered the best business case in the more complex scenario associated with exporting the energy carrier for transport uses, question marks remained over its competitiveness with local production.
Extrapolating the results, the paper suggested hydrogen transport within and around the EU would be most competitive in its compressed and liquefied forms, particularly via pipelines and especially if it can bring the savings of more than 50% suggested by the natural gas industry if existing infrastructure is adopted.
Chemical carriers LOHC and ammonia offer a business case which would render global hydrogen supply feasible, the paper found, for use by a single end-user for industry, with optimization of the associated packing and unpacking processes making the economics more attractive.
The potential importance of re-purposing natural gas pipes for hydrogen prompted the report's authors to suggest more research into how this can be achieved and they also called for R&D investment into hydrogen packing and unpacking. Along with a desire for more extensive mapping of global renewable electricity prices, the JRC document also emphasized the need to ensure adequate safety guidelines are in place if green hydrogen production is to be established in new global regions.

The ministry said in a statement it has also decided to grant a three-month grace period for the completion of projects under development, due to the Covid-19 crisis which has delayed construction works for many facilities.
According to the Taipei Times newspaper, the FITs were originally planned to be lowered to between NT$3.73 (US$0.13) and NT$5.63 (US$0.20) per kilowatt-hour but were, instead, maintained at the current level of between NT$3.79 and NT$5.67 per kWh.
The article also reports that Taiwanese solar manufacturers such as URE, Motech Industries Inc, and TSEC, during last week's meeting, had urged the government to raise the FITs to enable a quick market recovery, especially considering the recent price hike for raw materials used in solar panel manufacturing.
In 2020, Taiwan saw the deployment of around 1,667 MW of solar generation capacity, according to the latest figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency. Its cumulative capacity stood at 5.81 GW at the end of December.

The CPIA, a semi-official body and trade organization, has claimed the deadlines for connecting up subsidized and ‘grid-parity‘ solar projects which are registered, and/or have begun construction, have been extended by a year.
The industry group's assertion is based on one line from the Notice on Development and Construction of Wind and Photovoltaic Power Generation in 2021 policy promulgated by the NEA on May 20.
The latest edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big look at the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movements amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
The sentence in question reads (in translation): “All existing projects which are not finished [with a grid] connection within the year will be counted by provincial government and approved [for] the postponement to connection, [with a] scope of next year.”
The CPIA has interpreted “existing projects” as all facilities which have been registered since 2019 and/or upon which construction has started. As it stands, projects which have been approved for central government incentives must obtain a grid connection this month to receive their payments and unsubsidized ‘grid-parity' solar arrays must connect to the grid this year to benefit from the favorable policy treatment they qualify for under such status.
The Chinese solar trade entity has said the industry has not paid enough attention to this apparently significant concession to the sector by Beijing at a time when rising component prices are threatening to render approved projects unviable.
Many solar project investors and engineering, procurement and construction companies have suspended work amid rising solar costs which have included a quadrupling in the price of panel raw material polysilicon this year. Without an extension to grid connection deadlines, it is feared many projects could be abandoned entirely.
A glance at the business case for solar in a western province of China illustrates the dilemma facing investors. It has been estimated a 100 MW project connecting to the grid by December 31 in that region would offer investors an internal rate of return (IRR) of 6.6%, based on a purchase price of RMB0.2595/kWh ($0.0405) for the electricity generated at the site versus a solar module cost of RMB1.80/W ($0.28) of generation capacity, and a total solar system cost of RMB3.70/W ($0.58).
If, as the CPIA has stated, developers wait until the end of next year to connect the same system, the electricity sale price might only fall RMB0.0095/kWh ($0.0015), to RMB0.25, but module costs by that point may have stabilized back to RMB1.40/W, for a system cost of RMB3.10/W. That would mean an 8.21% IRR in the second half of 2022.
All eyes are on the NEA at this point.

Colombia‘s Ministry of Mines and Energy has launched, this week, the country's second auction for large scale renewable energy projects. The procurement exercise was originally planned to be held in the first quarter of this year but was then delayed due to the Covid-19 crisis.
Projects not exceeding 5 MW in size will be entitled to participate in the procurement exercise. Selected developers will be granted a 15-year PPA and will have to start commercial operation on January 1, 2023.
In the country’s first renewable energy auction, which was finalized in October 2019, the National Mining and Energy Planning Unit (UPME) allocated 2.2 GW of solar and wind power generation capacity. The exercise’s final average price was COP95/kWh ($0.026), and the highest bid reached only COP110 ($0.03).
Projects selected in this auction must come into operation on January 1, 2023. Contracts are linked to the Colombian peso and updated based on a producer price index certified by Colombia’s National Administrative Department of Statistics.
According to the latest figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency, Colombia had an operational installed PV capacity of around 107 MW at the end of 2020.

The scientists explained that the proposed concept, described as a multi-state energy conversion system, builds upon the experience gained in previous research with pumped-hydro gravity storage systems, compressed air gravity storage, suspended weight in abandoned mine shafts, dynamic modelling of gravity energy storage coupled with a PV energy plant, and deep ocean gravity energy storage. “Essentially, this research is geared towards designing a storage system using non-conventional methods and radical ideas with little similitude to previous research but totally different in functionality,” they affirmed.
The research team built their experimental system with a solar power generator; a bulk booster charge controller; an inverter; a solenoid device – which is a coil of wire used as an electromagnet; a deep cycle battery; a pulley block; a geared motor; a microcontroller; and wire ropes.
The battery is not used primarily for storage purposes but only for smoothing out the system's power output. It is connected to an inverter which, in turn, is connected to AC loads. “The life span of the battery in this proposed storage system will be longer, since the battery utilized here will have a constant output hour duration,” it warned.
The solar panels are connected via a diode to a charge controller that regulates the charges supplied to the deep cycle batteries and the electric geared motor. The latter is mounted on a foundation on the roof, which in turn opens into a hollow shaft connected to an intermediate pulley made up of two grooves. “One act[s] as the string wrap that carries the dead weight which falls under gravity when the solenoid retracts the geared motor shaft from the pulley shaft, while the other connects to the dynamo pulley via a flat belt,” the academics explained. “Then, the dynamo is connected to the battery via cables of considerable length, to avoid losses that may arise due to length and [the] resistivity of the cables used.”
Through a series of simulations the researchers found that, due to its high electrical requirements, the system needs to rely on high-power solar modules with an output of over 500 W, and suggested that a combination of multiple panels may be necessary for regions with low solar radiation levels. “This essentially proves the importance of effective utilization of this energy potential in continent[s] like Asia or Africa, with long sunlight stretches, as they will require [a] limited amount of panels, consequently reducing the cost incurred on [the] purchase of PV cells during set-up,” the researchers further explained, noting that raising of the weight and charging the battery requires a considerable amount of energy.
Africa is considered an ideal location, not only for its sunlight potential but also for the large amount of metal scrap materials it hosts, which can be converted to suspended weights at reasonable cost. “The unique characteristic of this system that makes it versatile, is the fact that it is not restricted to a particular land topographical reference or expensive component design materials,” they concluded. “Subsequent optimization of the design and sizing of this storage method might enable the gravity storage approach to compete favorably with current storage solutions already in the market.”
A complete description of the system can be found in the paper Gravitricity based on solar and gravity energy storage for residential applications, recently published in the International Journal of Energy and Environmental Engineering. The research group comprises scientists from the De Montfort University in the United Kingdom, and the Ahmadu Bello University in Nigeria.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/15/pv-policy-developments-in-the-baltic-states/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,EASTERN EUROPE,ESTONIA,LATVIA,LITHUANIA",,"JUNE 15, 2021",PV policy developments in the Baltic states,"From pv magazine 06/2021
At the end of 2020, the three Baltic states had a cumulative installed PV capacity of 800 MW. More than three-quarters of this has been installed in Estonia. Lithuania accounts for around one-fifth, while installations in Latvia are negligible.
The need to replace conventional power plants that were recently closed or are to be phased out partly explains the higher motivation for Estonia and Lithuania to expand the use of solar energy. As one of the EU member states with the highest per capita CO2 emissions, Estonia is being urged by the European Union to reduce its use of shale oil – the largest power generation source in the country. The planned closure of old shale oil facilities is incentivizing increased use of renewables.
Lithuania has been highly dependent on electricity imports since the closing of its last reactor at the Ignalina nuclear power plant in 2009. The plant was a bone of contention for Lithuania’s independence movement, Sąjūdis, in the late 1980s. Plans for a new nuclear power plant were shattered after Lithuanians voted against the resumption of the technology in a 2012 referendum. With a high share of hydropower, Latvia’s need for the build-out of further renewable capacities is less urgent.
Estonian market
Estonia’s PV market was driven by a feed-in premium scheme until the end of 2020. This scheme was discontinued for new installations outside of tenders from 51 kW to 1 MW at the end of 2018, and for systems smaller than 50 kW at the end of 2020. The phasing-out of the incentive created a rush of installations in 2020. As clusters of systems below 50 kW were permitted, a large part of Estonia’s installed capacity was made up of larger systems. The high volume of grid-connection requests for PV systems of close to 500 MW overwhelmed the grid companies, meaning nearly all plants built in 2020 will be connected to the grid in 2021 or in 2022. New installations instead have fallen drastically in 2021.
Net-metering in Lithuania
Since its introduction in 2015, Lithuania’s net-metering scheme has been amended several times. The most important changes came in October 2019. The upper size limit for commercial PV installations to run under net-metering was increased from 100 kW to 500 kW, and the upper limit for a simplified permitting process of microgeneration systems was raised from 10 kW to 30 kW. Another change to the net-metering scheme is the option to consume the electricity at a different location to the place of generation.
The latter has opened a whole new business model that enables customers who do not have their own roof space to buy or rent part of a solar park, and to run their part of the installation under the national net-metering scheme. It also helps developers to attract small investors. To bring together developers and investors, state-controlled utility Ignitis founded the first remote solar park platform in October 2019. Other companies offering participation in remote solar parks include Sun Investment group, Latvian utility Latvenergo, Egrupė and Saulės Grąža, and Solet Technics. The first remote solar parks to operate under this scheme were realized in 2020.
In addition to the net-metering scheme, Lithuania subsidizes on- and off-grid systems of up to 10 kW per installation, financed by the EU structural fund. Another subsidy for commercial systems in 2020 is also expected to be reissued in 2021. Latvia’s net-billing scheme was first introduced in 2014 and is much less attractive than the Lithuanian net-metering program. In Latvia, the electricity fed into the grid from the PV producer is not fully compensated. Improvements for microgeneration systems, effective from April 1, 2020, have only slightly increased the scheme’s attractiveness. Systems below 11.1 kW no longer need a permit from the Ministry of Economics, and net-metering systems are now exempt from the variable part of the mandatory procurement component (MPC) fee for electricity fed into the grid and taken back.
While the Latvian government is reportedly contemplating the opening of the net-billing scheme to larger systems and commercial installations, there are no known plans to improve the level of remuneration for the injected electricity.
Technology neutral tenders
To reach their renewable energy targets, Estonia and Lithuania have launched technology-neutral auctions, exposing PV projects to strong competition from wind power plants.
Lithuania’s auctions have not yet resulted in any awarded PV capacity. A pilot awarded all available capacity to a wind project, while the first regular round launched in May 2020 was cancelled due to low participation. A round planned for April 2021 has also been cancelled. According to the government, if all permitted renewable energy projects (mainly wind) are taken into account, the planned 5 TWh annually from renewables by 2025 should be reached without the need for further incentives. However, new auction rounds are not out of the question.
Estonia’s auctions have been more successful for solar. A total of 7.2 MW of PV projects below 1 MW was awarded in the first two pilot rounds in 2020. Each for an annual production of 5 GWh, for a feed-in premium on top of the wholesale price, to be paid for 12 years. After a third pilot round in July 2021, two large rounds are planned for late 2021 and for 2024 or 2025, with annual generation of 450 GWh and 650 GWh, respectively. However, there are concerns the entire first large tender could go to one wind power project.
Little progress
Utility-scale projects have emerged that could potentially be built outside of state auctions. In 2018, Estonian company Estiko Energia won a tender for a land plot near Tartu to be used for the construction of a 140-hectare solar park. But delays in clearing the site of thousands of tires were extensive. The project, with a planned capacity of up to 75 MW, has now missed the opportunity to benefit from the FIP scheme outside of government auctions, and the current status or plan is unclear.
A floating PV project of between 200 MW and 250 MW was planned for the reservoir of the Lithuanian Kruonis hydroelectric plant. However, during the installation of a 60 kW pilot system, the available technical solutions turned out to be unsuitable, and in 2020 the decision was made to postpone the project
indefinitely.

Australian financial group Macquarie Asset Management on Monday announced a €90 million ($109 million) debt investment in a portfolio of concentrated solar power (CSP) plants in southern Spain.
The portfolio consists of three 120 MW CSP plants that Q-Energy Asset Management refinanced in May. The 120 MW concentrated solar plant portfolio is made up of a 20 MW Gemasolar tower plant, the first solar plant in the world which can operate 24 hours a day, and two 50 MW parabolic trough solar parks.
The portfolio in Andalusia has been in operation since 2011, with Macquarie describing its owner, Q-Energy Asset Management, as having an established track record operating solar farms, CSP plants and wind parks across Western Europe. Q-Energy Asset Management was created by Spanish developer Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV) as its financial, legal and technical asset management arm. 
Macquarie Asset Management said that its investment was made “on behalf of its institutional clients via a bespoke, long-dated, subordinated debt financing.”
The project marks the fourth financing contract between Macquarie and Spain’s Q-Energy. Since 2012, Macquarie Asset Management has invested approximately €2.6 billion in more than 35 renewable energy projects, with a total installed capacity of approximately 13.7 GW.

Goldi Solar, a Gujarat-based solar panel manufacturer and EPC service provider, has announced plans to increase its manufacturing capacity to 2.5 GW per annum with a new facility on the outskirts of the Indian city of Surat. 
The manufacturer’s existing facility has a solar panel capacity of 500 MW. The 2 GW expansion plan features two stages. The first phase of 1 GW will become operational by September. The second phase of production will start by the end of next March.
Goldi Solar’s facility will feature a production line with new micro-gap module technology (MGMT). It will produce modules with gaps of less than 0.75 mm between the cells in the strings, instead of the standard 1.5 mm. This will ensure better coverage, resulting in improved productivity and higher outputs.
The production line will make mono-facial and bifacial modules with peak power outputs exceeding 500 W and 600 W, respectively. It will use M10 (182 mm x 182 mm) wafers, multi-busbars, and PERC solar cell technology.

XENDEE Corp. and Idaho National Laboratory launched a Microgrid Fast Charging Station Designer and tested and validated it with two case studies for grid-connected, islanded operation.
The project offers a design and validation framework for renewable energy-based microgrid configurations that deliver electric vehicle fast charging, energy security, and value-added grid services. Features are supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Microgrid Program and were built on an existing XENDEE platform.
The designer uses software to create project simulations, financial optimizations, and operational dispatches that aim to maximize system efficiency and capture early returns on investment. The platform also maps cables, transformers, and distributed technology interactions to anticipate and mitigate problems during peak usage or adverse conditions.
The optimizations were tested by INL. During these tests, INL’s simulations – which were based on real-world data from the University of California San Diego campus – concluded that electrical results matched within 5% of the predicted values.
The platform also optimizes dispatch and generation at each time step of the day enabling the microgrid to take advantage of energy sales to a utility and best manage fleet charging under changing hourly conditions. The tool is intended to help operators build microgrid systems, both grid connected and islanded, and to operate them efficiently under supply and demand conditions for fast charging at scale.
