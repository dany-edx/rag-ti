The event drew 5,000 attendees and 72 exhibitors across 8,500 m² of floor space, with more than 30 panel discussions focused on solar. pv magazine covered the first day of the conference in Prague, Czechia.
As the central European nation clocked in 2,627 MW of installed solar PV capacity at the end of 2022 – which is 426 MW up from the previous year, according to estimates published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) – the Czech Republic’s continued achievement of these solar gains was on the lips of most attendees. However, the obstacles in the way of these achievements – fraudulent operators, lagging grid infrastructure and lengthy application processes – were also discussed.
Czech Environment Minister Petr Hladik said that the solar industry is currently experiencing a huge boom. However, he dashed hopes for the country only pursuing PV by stating that its generating capacity would be a mix of renewables and nuclear. There are six commercial reactors generating roughly one-third of the landlocked country’s electricity.
Hladik said the government is on the cusp of releasing a national climate policy. The document will establish a roadmap for the government to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, including a fivefold increase in solar and wind capacity. He added that the government also wants to increase grid flexibility.
Robert Sedmera, a sales representative for Austrian PV manufacturer Fronius, told pv magazine that the company has operated in Czechia since 1991. He said he does not believe the country’s solar capabilities would ever eclipse nuclear, but noted that the public appetite is leaning more towards solar and cheaper electricity prices. Sedmera said the price for electricity is currently “high” at CZK 6 ($0.24)/kWh, and noted that there is an additional distribution fee of around CZK 4 crowns, bringing the total cost to CZK 10/kWh.
“About two, three, four years ago, the price for the electricity was much lower, so then the also the return of investment was 10 years or 12 years,” Sedmera said. “Nobody would like to, and nobody could, I would say, imagine that electricity would now cost that much.”
He said that compared to Austria and Poland, Czechia is not meeting all demand for solar. The government is “taking too long” to approve installations, he said.
Martin Bursik, president of the European Renewable Energies Federation (EREF), said that the elephant in the room for Czechia is the government's lengthy approval process. However, he said that a directive is in the pipeline so times could be slashed if projects met certain criteria.
Pavel Chovanec, sales manager of local distribution company SolSol, told pv magazine that government subsidies have helped to ramp up commercial PV installations of late. But he agrees that local authorities need to expedite sluggish processes.
Miloš Preisinger, a renewable energy specialist for Swiss mechatronics specialist Stäubli, told pv magazine that the local solar market is growing due to changing government legislation and growing community desire to cut back on fossil fuel emissions. However, he claimed that “risky products and companies” have threatened to derail the reputation of the local sector.
Milan Hošek, a representative from the Czech Photovoltaic Association, echoed these concerns. He told pv magazine that the caliber of rooftop installations is the “biggest problem” facing the domestic industry. He said that incorrectly installed PV rooftop arrays pose lightning risks, and that could damage the sector's reputation.
Preisinger said another “major problem” is grid connection. The government needs to invest in improving aging infrastructure, he said, estimating it would cost “many millions” over at least five years to ensure that the entire country is properly connected.
“It is very important because many people have made investments to the photovoltaic system,” Preisinger said.
Stepan Chalupa, president of the Czech Renewable Energy Chamber, said that Czechia's energy market is continuously improving but better regulations are needed to prohibit fraudulent providers from operating. This concern was echoed by Natálie Foltýnová, marketing coordinator of German renewables developer BayWa re.
Due to surging energy prices caused by the war in Ukraine, “everyone wanted PV on their roof in the Czech Republic” last year, she said. This led to more mounting companies flooding the market, but not always delivering results. “They only collected money,” Foltýnová explained. “Now everybody is afraid, and nobody trusts the mounting system companies.”
Chalupa appeared to express optimism about the government working with stakeholders to establish key acceleration project zones. Later in the day, Pavel Doucha, founder and partner of the local law firm Doucha Šikola advokáti, clarified this legislative push in greater detail.
In a speech on upcoming Czech solar and battery energy storage system (BESS) legislation, Doucha noted a number of major legislative changes for 2023. He pointed to efforts to amend energy and construction laws for larger projects and the drive for a European Council framework to accelerate smaller renewable energy initiatives of around 50 MW. From next year, reforming construction laws will streamline PV environmental approvals, he added.
Expected changes in the upcoming year include delineating and simplifying solar array areas and amending the agricultural land fund to prevent solar parks on such land. Additionally, a new office in Prague will process large PV applications.
The most crucial change is identifying key regions for large-scale solar, with 13% of the territory deemed suitable. The government's Ministry of the Environment is mapping these regions, which are protected by up to 60 layers of regulations, including national park, cultural heritage, and rare species zones. The government aims to simplify these layers, but the extent of simplification remains uncertain.
Susie Su, eastern Europe sales manager for China-based solar inverter manufacturer Growatt, told pv magazine that a major challenge in Czechiac is that certain stock that clients bought last year was declining. However, there is the potential for commercial solar solutions “growing,” she said.
“I heard from our partner that there will be some subsidy model commercial solution, for example, a factory can install the commercial operation though the commercial solution, [and] can save more money on the electricity bill,” she said. “I think it will be good for business.”

The new product includes standard features such as a built-in circulating pump, an expansion tank, and a safety valve.
“We produce the new heat pump at our factory in Guadalajara, near Madrid, in Spain,” the company's head of operations, Adam Clarke, told pv magazine. “This is a monobloc heat pump, which means you don't have to be an F-Gas certified installer to install it. The system can be scaled by stacking more units together to provide higher capacities.”
The new heat pumps come in seven versions, offering cooling capacities ranging from 4.33 kW to 11.50 kW and power inputs ranging from 1.37 kW to 3.58 kW. The smallest model, ACP04, has a seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) of 4.56 and weighs 61 kg, while the largest, ACP14T, boasts a SCOP of 4.85 and weighs 136 kg. All versions have a maximum operating pressure of 6 bar and use R32 as the refrigerant.
Users in need of greater hot water capacity during high-demand periods can add the EH200BT50 module to the heat pump. This module enables the generation of domestic hot water and its storage in two independent tanks.
The manufacturer said the unit is designed to optimize performance while minimizing space and weight, providing exceptional comfort and convenience.
Fischer Commercial, based in Leicester, England, operates two heating system factories in Germany and Spain and serves all European markets.

The project involves producing and storing 100% renewable hydrogen using the gas turbine of Smurfit Kappa, a paper packaging company in Saillat-sur-Vienne, France.
The consortium includes Germany's Siemens Energy, French energy giant Engie, UK gas turbine manufacturer Centrax, French consultancy Arttic, the German Aerospace Center (DLR), and four European universities.
According to Siemens Energy, hydrogen is produced on site with a 1 MW electrolyzer, stored in a 1 ton tank to power a Siemens Energy SGT-400 industrial gas turbine.
Siemens Energy supplied the electrolyzer for hydrogen production and developed the hydrogen gas turbine. Engie handled  production, storage, and the supply of hydrogen for the demonstrator, while Centrax updated the package for safe hydrogen fuel operation.
The project also secured contributions from the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the Universities of Lund, Duisburg-Essen, and University College London. They helped to develop the hydrogen turbine technology. Arttic supported the project's operational management, and the National Polytechnic University of Athens conducted an economic, environmental, and social analysis of the concept.
Earlier this year, the successful test of an electricity generation demonstrator using a mixture of 30% hydrogen and 70% natural gas was announced. The project, originating in 2020, received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Framework Programme.

REC said the Alpha Pure-RX series, which is based on the company’s heterojunction solar cell technology (HJT), is the highest power class residential solar panel that it has yet produced with a power density of 226 W/m2.
The Alpha Pure-RX is available in three versions, with power ratings ranging from 450 W to 470 W, and efficiencies of 21.6% to 22.6%. The modules are made with 80 heterojunction, half-cut monocrystalline solar cells and have a maximum system voltage of 1,000 V.
The modules have open-circuit voltages ranging between 65.1 V and 65.6 V, short-circuit currents ranging from 8.81 A to 8.95 A, can operate within a temperature range of -40 C to 85 C, and have a power temperature coefficient of -0.24% per degree Celsius.
All three panels in the series measure 1,728 mm × 1,205 mm × 30 mm and weigh 23.2 kg. They feature a 3.2 mm solar glass with anti-reflective treatment, a black polymer backsheet, an anodized aluminium frame, and an IP68-rated junction box.
REC said the four-part junction box design makes the module a good performer in shady conditions and it is also designed to withstand weather extremes – including Australia’s hot climate.
“These panels perform better under low light and hot days offering higher power generation with a guaranteed power output of at least 92% at year 25,” the company said.
REC said the Alpha Pure-RX series will be showcased at the All-Energy conference in Melbourne next week when the manufacturer will also unveil its Alpha Pro M panel, a HJT solar panel targeted at commercial and industrial projects.
Gus Paviani, REC’s head of Asia Pacific and Japan, said the Alpha Pro M is the highest power class solar panel available in the market with a power output of up to 640 Wp and efficiencies of 21.8% to 22.9%.
“The REC Alpha family delivers top-quality, high-performance solar panels for homeowners, businesses and now for commercial and industrial project markets,” he said.
The manufacturer said the Alpha Pure-R panels are available to order now with the Alpha Pure-RX and Alpha Pro M panels expected to be available in Australia and New Zealand in the first quarter of 2024.

Solar installations in India have been steadily rising since March 2023. As per official numbers, India installed 9 GW (AC) of solar capacity from January to August 2023, which is around 12 GW of DC capacity, according to estimates. These installation numbers reflect many projects that were originally supposed to be built in 2021 and 2022 but were hindered by high equipment prices.
A government-approved relaxation of restrictions imposed by the approved list of models and manufacturers (ALMM) – which indicates which products can be included in government-backed projects – has accelerated Indian PV installations, helped also by falling module prices.
The start of 2023 looked a bit gloomy for India, compared with the usual pattern of a strong first quarter each calendar year. Module price and availability prevented many projects from being completed. In May, after the SNEC solar trade show in China, the market turned around. Module prices, excluding import duties, quickly dropped below $0.18 per watt (W) and continued to fall, reaching less than $0.15/W in the July to September period. Installers took the chance to complete pending projects, driving the current installation boom, which is likely to continue through the first three months of next year.
Local developers have grabbed the opportunity offered by module price declines to order in bulk. We believe that will lead to a strong upswing in module imports in the final three months of this year and the first three months of 2024. These modules will go into projects in the first part of next year and possibly even further out, depending on how legislation evolves.
Current regulation allows for government-tendered projects to include modules not named on the ALMM list, until March 31, 2024. Modules imported before that deadline but not installed will not be eligible for installation on government-aided projects. Developers are trying to persuade the government to extend that deadline by another three months, to give them more flexibility in terms of orders and imports.
Module manufacturers have ramped up India’s solar panel output, with annual production capacity expansions driven by national local-content policies. Annual module manufacturing capacity in India has already crossed the 20 GW mark but the factory utilization rate remains below 50% to date. That means, with local manufacturers having brought their prices closer to the cost of imported modules (plus basic customs duty), they will not be able to meet demand.
The fall in imported solar cell prices has resulted in a strong spike of cell imports over the past few months, which is likely to boost solar module-assembly factory utilization rates. The share of Indian-manufactured modules in new installations is expected to increase accordingly, especially after March 2024.
The combined generation capacity of imported and locally manufactured modules is still not enough to supply the 60 GW (AC) or so of solar projects that the Central Electricity Authority reports as being at some stage of construction.
Projects corresponding to more than two thirds of this capacity are unlikely to obtain modules before March 31, 2024. Hence, most developers of government-backed projects will need to procure modules included on the ALMM list. Such constraints on module procurement put the solar project pipeline at risk of delays.
In parallel with the government-backed PV project pipeline that dominates the Indian solar market, there is also growing interest among commercial and industrial electricity consumers seeking to procure solar power via on-site systems or private power purchase agreements. As these are not limited by ALMM list requirements, these segments of the solar industry are in position to benefit from possible module inventories in 2024. India’s PV deployment is, hence, set to diversify further across different market segments.
Given the high number of PV projects waiting to be commissioned and the level of module imports expected for the rest of the year, S&P Global Commodity Insights forecasts India will have installed 20 GW of solar this year. Solar installations in 2024 could be even higher than our forecast, depending upon government policy and possible further ALMM relaxations. Deadline extensions are possible, as we have seen previously in India’s solar power market.

If the European Parliament approves the reforms, they will result in more stable energy prices, lower dependence on fossil fuel costs, and better crisis resilience, according to Teresa Ribera Rodríguez, Spain's ecological transition minister.
“We will also accelerate the deployment of renewables, a cheaper and cleaner source of energy for our citizens,” she said.
The EU Council has announced reforms to stabilize long-term electricity markets, in order to support power purchase agreements (PPAs). The changes involve generalizing two-way contracts for difference (CfDs) and enhancing forward market liquidity. Member states will support PPAs by removing specific barriers and eliminating “disproportionate or discriminatory” procedures if these reforms are approved.
“Measures may include among other things, state-backed guarantee schemes at market prices, private guarantees, or facilities pooling demand for PPAs,” said the EU Council. “Measures may include among other things, state-backed guarantee schemes at market prices, private guarantees, or facilities pooling demand for PPAs.”
Two-way contracts for difference – only applied after a transition period of three years, but five years for hybrid projects connected to two or more bidding zones – would apply to investments in renewable energy, including solar.
“The council added flexibility as to how revenues generated by the state through two-way CfDs would be redistributed,” it said. “Revenues would be redistributed to final customers and they may also be used to finance the costs of the direct price support schemes or investments to reduce electricity costs for final customers.”
The proposal includes a clause regarding consumer protection, with the amendment establishing the free choice of supplier and the option of accessing dynamic electricity prices. This would be across fixed-term and long-term contracts.
“The council agreed to stricter rules than previously for suppliers in their price-hedging strategies to shield customers from variations on wholesale markets,” the council stated. “It agreed to protect vulnerable customers from disconnections by putting in place ‘supplier of last resort’ systems to ensure the continuity of supply at least for household customers if such systems do not already exist.
The reforms also empower member states to set regulated prices for small- to medium-sized businesses during crises, according to the announcement.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/19/organic-pv-developer-unveils-kit-to-develop-new-indoor-battery-free-applications/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWEDEN",VALERIE THOMPSON,"OCTOBER 19, 2023",Epishine unveils organic PV kit for indoor battery-free applications,"Linköping-based Epishine has launched a developer kit for the evaluation of its organic PV (OPV) technology, which it claims can replace or augment batteries in small indoor environmental sensing, information displays, and monitoring devices. The kit is targeted at innovators and original equipment manufacturers (OEM) considering embedding organic solar cells as a power source in new products.
Optimized for indoor lighting conditions and wireless low-power applications, the developer kit contains a supercapacitor, or energy buffer, that can be reconfigured to act as a battery, as well as embedded maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and a management system to handle charging, output voltages, and energy storage mechanisms.
“The evaluation kit highlights the power of Epishine’s indoor solar cells, demonstrating their ability to power low-power wireless devices. It combines our solar cells with a supercapacitor and allows for a fast replacement of primary batteries to evaluate light energy harvesting,” Jonas Bergqvist, CTO, Epishine told pv magazine.
The unit has sufficient current to support low-power data communications protocols, such Zigbee and LoRa, with output voltage ranging from 1.8 V to 3.3 V in 0.1 V steps, up to 300 mA output current, according to the company. It is purportedly safe for operation at -20C to 40C and a humidity range of 0 to 85%. Illumination intensity ranges from 20 lux to 1,000 lux.
The company claims that if the supercapacitor is empty, the circuit is able to start up with an input voltage of 38 mV. The maximum charge voltage of the capacitor is limited to 4.5 V.
Epishine recently subjected its LEH3_50x50_6_10 product to a lifecycle assessment (LCA) by Swedish environmental consultancy Miljögiraff and third-party reviewed by Sweco, a Stockholm-based engineering firm, resulting in a carbon footprint measurement of 0.86 g CO2eq/cm2.
The low carbon footprint is attributed in part to the company's patented production process, which avoids high temperatures and excludes certain materials. According to Bergqvist, it is cost-efficient too. “Roll to roll printing aligns well with these design rules with a very high degree of automation and comparably low process temperatures. Further, we have chosen to not use transparent conductive oxide electrodes, but all our solar cell layers are deposited from solution, thereby enabling a fully roll to roll printed solar cell with a high and very robust performance for indoor low light applications,” said Bergqvist.
Epishine offers customized cell sizes, supporting cut-outs in the cell surface, in sizes ranging from 20 cm2 to 300 cm2, to make the technology available to a wider range of sensor devices and internet of things (IoT) end nodes
In July, the six year old, company raised SEK 60 million ($5.43 million) in a round led by Jula Miljö & Energi, which belongs to Jula Holding, a diversified retail, real estate, and energy holding company based in Sweden, to fund product development and scaling up production in order to increase its market share in the indoor solar cell market.

Dracula Technologies, a manufacturer of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices for connected objects, has announced the construction of its new “Green MicroPower Factory” in Valence, France, following the installation of a pilot line in 2022.
The factory is set to become the largest production site for OPV modules in Europe. It aims to produce up to 150 million cm² of OPV devices annually, while reducing unit production costs by threefold. Dracula Technologies has not disclosed the unit price of its cells but noted that the cells generate 45 µw/cm² of power under indoor lighting at 1000 lux.
To support large-scale production, Dracula will hire over 100 additional employees, with a target of reaching more than 250 employees by 2030. The company, anticipating a €3 million ($3.16 million) turnover in 2023, plans to start delivering modules to customers in early 2024 while continuing its practice of licensing its technology.
Dracula Technologies specializes in OPV modules developed using “inkjet” digital printing, employing materials for its inks that do not contain rare earths and are primarily sourced from France. Its “Layer” technology functions under ambient light, even in low light conditions (less than 50 lux), eliminating the need for mains electricity or batteries.
The new factory represents a total investment of €15 million, with funding coming from a €5.5 million fundraising effort in collaboration with Banque des Territoires, the Auvergne Rhône-Alpes sovereign fund, and Semtech, a global semiconductor manufacturer serving as a strategic investor. An additional €1.6 million in grants from the EIC Accelerator program and several loans have also contributed to the financing.
Dracula Technologies has also secured €5 million from the French government as the winner of the France 2030 “First Factory” tender.
“This will transform our company into a major European player in renewable energy and be one of the 100 industrial sites expected in France by 2030,” said CEO Brice Cruchon.

The system is intended to provide cooling and heating to greenhouses.
“In Korea, geothermal energy is widely used as renewable energy for agriculture, but if geothermal heat is used for a long time, the heat source becomes insufficient,” the agency said, noting that covering around 10% of the greenhouse's roof with PVT panels may easily compensate for this typical shortcoming of geothermal energy. 
The researchers said the PVT panels are able to produce hot water at temperatures ranging between 30 C and 40 C. “This is then used as a heat source for the heat pump to produce hot water at temperatures ranging from 48 C to 50 C, which is a suitable range for greenhouse heating,” they explained.
In spring, summer, and fall, when heating is not needed, the heat produced by the PV panels is sent to the groundwater layer, stored, and used to heat the greenhouse in winter.

The PVT system used in the project has an overall efficiency of 73% and is able to achieve an electricity output of 3 kW and a heat output of 7.9 kW of heat occupying a roof surface of around 18㎡. The presence of the PVT panels, according to the research group, allowed them to reduce the installed capacity of the existing geothermal system by up to 30%.
The researchers conducted an economic analysis of the system performance and found it may reduce heating and cooling costs in a greenhouse by up to 78% compared to diesel generators. They also estimated that the system may achieve a payback time of 4.4 years. “The PVT panels can increase the energy saving rate of a greenhouse by 20% compared to existing geothermal systems,” the researchers added.
The Rural Development Administration said it has applied for a patent for this technology and plans to distribute it to Korean farmers.
“The price of electricity for agricultural use is rising, putting a huge burden on farm management,” said the agency. “We are actively using new and renewable energy such as solar power, heat, and geothermal heat to reduce the costs and achieve carbon neutrality.”

Qcells announced the successful completion of the expansion of its solar module factory in Dalton, Georgia where it added 2 GW of solar capacity, bringing the factory’s output to more than 5.1 GW.
The company said its Dalton factory is the largest manufacturing plant of its kind in the Western Hemisphere and the first solar panel plant expansion since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
The expanded factory will manufacture nearly 30,000 solar modules a day, focusing on the new Q.TRON G2 residential solar module and a bifacial module for the commercial and utility markets. The company expects both products to achieve an ecolabel known as EPEAT, which is intended to help customers identify sustainably made products. QCells says the expanded factory will create 510 new jobs.
“Completing this factory marks the third expansion we’ve made in Dalton, and it’s just the beginning of Qcells’ larger mission to build a fully integrated solar supply chain in America,” said Justin Lee, CEO of Qcells. “The Inflation Reduction Act and the efforts of Georgia’s economic development team helped make these ambitious plans possible, and with it thousands of careers in clean energy. As we build new solar technology from Dalton and prepare for the start of Cartersville, it is critical that our local to federal leaders continue to work not only with us, but the larger industry to ensure our collective investments deliver for communities for decades to come.”
In January, QCells announced that it would invest more than $2.5 billion to build a complete solar supply chain in the U.S.. Considered the largest investment in U.S. solar history, it also made QCells, a subsidiary of Hanwha Solutions, the first company to establish a fully-integrated silicon-based solar supply chain in the U.S.  Qcells intends to break ground on a new, state-of-the-art facility in Cartersville, Georgia, where it will manufacture 3.3 GW of solar ingots, wafers, cells and finished modules.
By 2024, between the Dalton and Cartersville facilities, Qcells anticipates its solar production capacity will reach 8.4 GW a year, or enough to power 1.3 million homes annually with clean energy.
Qcells opened its first factory in Georgia in 2019 and hired 750 people to manufacture 1.7 GW of solar. This initial investment was made possible in part by the Section 201 tariffs imposed on solar cells. Last year, Qcells announced a second expansion, which would add 1.4 GW to its manufacturing output and hire 535 more people. This now completed third expansion as well as the new facility that will manufacturing cells, wafers and ingots, follow the passage of the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act (SEMA) within the IRA and are made possible with support from Georgia’s economic development team.
Upon completed construction, Qcells estimates that its production in Georgia could avoid more than 12 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents per year while expanding domestic manufacturing of solar products amidst the push for Made-in-America clean energy solutions.

They presented three different BIPV integration scenarios for the GESA building, an office building built in the 1960s in Palma de Mallorca, in Spain's southern archipelago of the Balearic Islands.
“Despite of its iconic and protected status, the GESA building has been abandoned for several years, hence it requires a refurbishment that will also update its skin to the current energy efficiency standards,” the scientists explained. “The inefficient envelope, location (isolated and in a sunny climate), and representability of a typology of office building make it a good reference for studying the impact of refurbishing with BIPV.”
Via the TRNSYS simulation software, which is commonly used to simulate the behavior of transient renewable systems, the group simulated the impact of BIPV taking as reference a representative floor. As in the physical building, among the parameters inserted are the GESA building’s curtain wall structure, which is 77% composed of semi-transparent windows and 23% of non-window opaque areas. As the building, although abandoned, is protected by a local heritage commission, the façade design has to keep its original characteristics.
The reference scenario was based on the existing double-glazing Parsol Bronze window. It was compared to four other scenarios, one with only solar control windows; the second with solar control windows and BIPV modules in the opaque area; the third with only transparent BIPV windows; and the fourth with BIPV windows and opaque BIPV in non-transparent areas.
“The data for the transparent PV used in this study is based on a prototype currently in development, hence there is room to improve the thermal, optical, and electrical properties to better fit the building needs, as well as to increase the PV conversion efficiency,” the research group emphasized.
According to the results, the final energy consumption in the existing reference case was simulated at 51.3 kWh/m2. In the case of only solar control windows, this value reached 45.8 kWh/m2, with very similar results with the addition of opaque BIPV. However, in this case, the building will be able to use 5.8 kWh/m2 and export 2.6 kWh/m2 to the grid.
In the case of only transparent BIPV windows, the energy consumption will be higher, as that module will block more of the solar radiation and, therefore, result in higher heating and lighting demands. Overall, that system will require 49.8 kWh/m2 while consuming 5.1 kWh/m2 and exporting 2.2 kWh/m2. In the case of using window BIPV and opaque BIPV, the demand will reach 47.6 kWh/m2, while self-consumption will take 10.9 kWh/m2 and 5 kWh/m2 will be exported to the grid.
“The results show the potential of the BIPV solutions for improving the energy balance of the building. The transparent PV reduced the energy demand by 6.9% and the total energy balance by 21%,” the scientists added. “The opaque PV further improved the results of the two glazing system solutions, the energy balance improving to 28.1% and 38.3% with the solar control and transparent PV solutions, respectively.”
The researchers also conducted an economical analysis, which they claim showcases the “relevance of the electricity pricing schemes into the promotion of BIPV.” The components and installation cost of the components were mostly obtained from a construction materials database, while the cost of the prototype window BIPV was assumed at €200 ($210.65)/m2.
The October issue of pv magazine turns the spotlight back onto agrivoltaics. We’ll consider how solar on farmland is taking root in Australia and South Africa, how agrivoltaic data harvesting could help more farmers take the plunge, and how an insistence on expensive minimum heights for agrivoltaic panels is hindering the technology in Italy.
They looked into two tariff levels. The first is based on current Spanish tariffs and demand, while the second assumes a high penetration of PV into the national grid. In this case, the net load of high-penetration photovoltaics presents a very low price. Another variable was the compensation for the electricity sold to the grid by the building, which they estimated at either 0%, 30%, or 100% of the electricity price.
Currently, 30% of the electricity price is the typical export value in Spain. Under this assumption, with the current price profile, the discounted payback time for solar control will be 24 years, for solar control and opaque BIPV it will be 14 years, for window BIPV only it will be over 50 years, and the combination of both BIPV technologies will result in a payback time of 24 years. In the assumption of high PV penetration and 30% electricity price, however, the payback time in all systems may exceed over 50 years.
“The lower average electricity price and, more importantly, the timing of the generation in the ‘high PV’ scenario explain the significantly worse payback periods,” they concluded.
Their findings are available in the paper “Impact of building integrated photovoltaics on high rise office building in the Mediterranean,” published in Energy Reports, which also included an economic evaluation. The research group comprised academics from The Technical University of Catalonia and the Catalonia Institute for Energy Research.

LG Energy Solutions is set to launch a new residential energy storage system in the US market in November. The enblock S products are stackable, modular lithium-ion batteries designed for easy installation. 
The batteries offer the flexibility to stack three, four, or five battery module assemblies, each accompanied by a battery control unit. The S 10, the smallest size, comprises three module assemblies with a total of 10.6 kWh. The S 14 includes four battery module assemblies, providing 14.1 kWh, while the largest, the S 17, features five battery module assemblies, offering 17.7 kWh of capacity. The enblock S system also supports the parallel connection of two matching units, enabling a maximum power output of 14 kW.
LG said customers can increase energy capacity based on their energy consumption patterns by purchasing additional modules. As homeowners continue to electrify appliances and purchase EVs, flexibility in battery capacity offers a way to meet growing demand. 
The company noted the straightforward installation process for the batteries, featuring a plug-and-play connector without the need to fasten bolts. An enblock S installation can be efficiently completed by a single installer in just 15 minutes. The batteries support both wall-mounted and standing configurations and are suitable for both indoor and outdoor use.
The company said the batteries meet stringent safety standards to prevent thermal runaway fires, a concern with some lithium-ion home batteries, successfully passing UL9540A testing.
Later this year, LG will introduce the enblock S+ variant, which allows customers to acquire the enblock S batteries along with the company's new AC-coupled inverter as a bundled solution. This coupled option is available in two configurations: backup power and energy arbitrage, and it can be retrofitted to an existing PV system.
Battery owners can also use the LG Energy Solution Monitor app to track real-time energy consumption and production.
“LG Energy Solution enblock S is a versatile, expandable, and simple to install Energy Storage System (ESS),” said Matthew Unverferth, residential ESS sales manager with the LGES ESS team in North America. “To offer the highest level of product safety, LG Energy Solutions enblock S was laboratory tested and proven compliant, receiving the industry standard UL9540A fire safety rating.”
