With the latest perovskite solar cells having achieved near-unity light absorption and efficient charge collection under short-circuit conditions, enhancing electroluminescence quantum efficiency is believed to be the final key to reducing voltage loss and reaching the SQ limit.
With that in mind, researchers from the Dresden Integrated Center for Applied Physics and Photonic Materials (IAPP), at the Technische Universität Dresden, have examined the effect of photon recycling and found significant additional light emission is achieved by recursively recycling trapped photons in perovskites.
When a photon is radiated inside re-absorbing semiconductors such as perovskites, it can be re-absorbed by the emitter itself and a new photon can be generated via photoluminescence. Such a process of recursively re-absorbing and re-emitting the photons is called photon recycling. The IAPP researchers say photon recycling and light scattering effects greatly improve light emission efficiency by a factor of around five, thus significantly improving the photovoltage of perovskite solar cells.
“Perovskites are already good absorbers,” said Changsoon Cho, who led the work as a Humboldt research fellow at IAPP. “Now it’s time to improve their light-emitting ability to even further increase their already high power conversion efficiencies. Understanding photon recycling is a crucial step towards this direction.”
The researchers also found that, via photon recycling, the upper limit for the efficiency of the perovskite solar cells rose from 29.2% to 31.3%. Their work predicts that the contribution of photon recycling, along with the suppression of various optoelectrical losses, will lead to a further increase in performance in the future.
The research results were recently published in the paper “Effects of Photon Recycling and Scattering in High-Performance Perovskite Solar Cells,” in the journal Science Advances.

If that result is confirmed by official numbers which will be published by the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE), in February or March, last year may prove to have been the best year ever recorded for the Scandinavian country, in terms of new solar installations.
In 2020, newly installed PV capacity was around 31.7MW and, in the previous year, new solar arrays totaled 51MW. Norway had added 23.5MW of solar in 2018; 18MW a year earlier, and 11MW in 2016.
Solenergiklyngen's estimations for 2021 are based on figures provided by the Norwegian energy industry's common data hub, Elhub, which reported that 38MW of PV systems were grid-connected last year. “These figures, however, are based on data that are being provided with [a] delay,” the association stated. “Our figures … suggest that the Norwegian solar energy market may have grown last year by around 50% compared to 2020.”
Solenergiklyngen added, the current energy price crisis has given a strong boost to the market, and said that industrial customers are increasingly resorting to solar to reduce their skyrocketing energy bills.
Adding the 65MW of residential PV installed last year to the cumulative PV capacity of 150MW that Norway had reached at the end of 2020, the country has now reached 215MW.

Engie Green, a unit of French energy company Engie, is building a pilot vertical PV project in France with the support of the National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (INRAE).
The Camelia demonstrator plant is being deployed on a pasture area belonging to INRAE located in the municipality of Laqueuille, under the scientific supervision of the country's Grassland Ecosystem Research Unit (UREP).
The 100kW pilot facility will be aimed at measuring its agronomic effects on aerial and underground microclimates and biomass growth and production, as well as on the quality of fodder, soil fertility and carbon stocks.
Engie experts will also study the behavior of cattle and the compatibility of vertical structures with the use of agricultural machinery. The company's research center, Laborelec, will actively participate in the analysis of the system's performance.
“A set of measurements on the microclimate, the soil, and the vegetation will allow us to identify the positive and negative effects of this installation on the ground compared to a conventional solar plant,” said Catherine Picon-Cochard, director of UREP.
For this purpose, photovoltaic hedges will be designed to adapt to agricultural activity with a minimal footprint and a simple, modular and reversible anchoring system. These will be installed on a grazed agricultural area of 0.9ha near a control area.
The overall Engie investment budget amounts to nearly €1 million. After several months of local consultation and the award of a building permit, construction of the installation will begin at the end of winter and the commissioning and injection of the first kilowatt-hour of solar electricity into the network is scheduled for spring 2022.

Called the 1+X modular inverter, the new product can be deployed, by combining eight units, to reach a power of 8.8MW. The inverter has a three-level modularization at the inverter level, the system level and the component level.
“The system modularization makes PV module configuration more flexible to extend,” Sungrow said in a statement. The inverter is said to supports a maximum two times DC/AC ratio. Moreover, the 1+X modular inverter has 42% more MPPT than traditional central inverters and it realizes string-level management by means of a new wireless DC combiner.
The system also features a DC/ESS interface for the connection of energy storage systems.
“The component modularization realizes the plug and play function, reducing the maintenance from six hours to two hours,” the manufacturer further explained, noting that, since each inverter also works in an individual unit, it can be directly replaced by an on-site back-up inverter if a failure occurs.

It has been quite the journey. Was the project fully funded by the US$1.4 million crowd sale alone?
Abraham Cambridge: Yes, all our projects are fully funded by crowd sales on our platform. The project has 1,905 [solar] cell owners from all over the world. This is our biggest project, currently. It is a significant project in the solar sector, especially in the sub-Saharan Africa region, and its value is US$1.4 million. We have proven that individuals worldwide want to see such projects happen without relying on big investors to make such projects happen.
Solar could disrupt the fossil fuel industry and help with two of the biggest sustainability challenges of our times: biodiversity loss and food production. pv magazine, as part of its UP initiative, has shone a light on agrivoltaics. Read our coverage here.
pv mag: What challenges have you experienced in this journey, including due to Covid-19 restrictions?
AC: The main challenges with the project were logistics and shipping from China. During the construction phase, the Chinese government banned the export of lithium batteries by ship. We were not able to [import] batteries for quite a period. The solar plant was installed but it could not operate without the batteries since it was designed to be integrated. This caused a delay.
The shipping industry in general was a challenge since the crowd sale ended. After the crowd sale ended, the [Ever Given] ship stuck at the Suez Canal in Egypt caused a backlog of shipping issues, resulting in delays.
However, Zimbabwe has been very open and helpful during the period, despite the challenges. They have administered a good vaccination program with a very high vaccination rate in the country. The installation team has been in Zimbabwe the whole time and a significant number are Zimbabweans.

pv mag: What happens next, after handing over to Nhimbe Fresh? Will you still be on the ground maintaining the project?
AC: Actually, the system is handed over to us, Sunexchange [The Sun Exchange]. The system is currently under synergy; the EPC [engineering, procurement and construction services provider], Sunexchange, will accept the system this [month]. We own and operate the system. Nhimbe Fresh is the tenant, and they will be leasing the system from Sunexchange.
We will, from now on, monitor the system [and] build up maintenance reserves to make sure the system can be looked after in the long term. We will be doing any servicing required, [we will] replace the batteries once they reach their evident life and generally perform all the operations, maintenance, and insurance of the solar plant for its entire lifetime. We will be looking after the plant for the next 20 years.
Image: The Sun Exchange
pv mag: How much should investors expect to make and for how long, and what is the total energy capacity of the project and energy demand for Nhimbe Fresh?
AC: The system is 500kW of PV and 1MWh of battery. The great thing about the battery in place is that solar energy can be used 24 hours a day. For example, when there is load shedding, the solar power plant comes out … if there is no battery. Since the system has a battery installed, solar energy can be used 24 hours a day.
The energy reliability is perfect. This gives a high value to the energy, and the return to the people who own the solar cells in the project is around 13% IRR [internal rate of return] on the U.S. dollar, and those payments are fixed. It's a fixed monthly payment for each solar cell they own. They can earn in Bitcoin or South African rand. The lease is denominated in U.S. dollars and converted into Bitcoin or rand, depending on [the] preference [of investors].
The majority of our payouts are about 60% in Bitcoin and 40% in South African rand. The number of people who choose to earn in Bitcoin keeps increasing as Bitcoin becomes more popular and accepted.
The investors will be earning over the 20-year lease period. After the lease expires, the system is either extended, updated, or decommissioned. Nhimbe Fresh can either take over the system after the 20-year lease period, since it has a 25-year warranty and has some lifetime period left, or we can extend the lease and upgrade the necessary components.
pv mag: What made you decide that going solar was the best decision for Nhimbe Fresh?
Edwin Masimba Moyo: The system was made to solve the challenges we had with ZESA [state utility the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority]. We had outages of power which led to production delays, and the quality of our products gets compromised since we are in the cold chain industry.
By going solar, we won't be short of power and we can run all our projects, such as irrigation [and] packaging, and the cold room will be efficient 24/7. We have 20 hectares of blueberries which will be solar powered soon, and our packhouse will also be solar-powered.
Once we go fully solar-powered, and the second phase is completed, we will be able to do about 200 hectares of blueberries, resulting in the employment of about 5,000 jobs between now and 2025. Currently, we are at the first phase, which is the pack house, the second phase will be powering all the firms, which is irrigation.
pv mag: How has productivity improved, or will be expected to improve going forward, due to getting solar-powered?
EMM: We will be able to attract more markets now because we produce our product under the requirement of low carbon emissions. We will be able to quantify how many carbon credits we are creating. We will be attractive in the market because of growing our product using solar. Most supermarket chains will like that because the product is produced under an environmentally friendly situation, looking after the environment, and we are number one in Zimbabwe at the moment!
Image: The Sun Exchange
pv mag: Is there any substantial impact from going solar? How has the reputation and brand of Nhimbe Fresh changed in the community and country as a whole?
EMM: There has been a tremendous improvement. We were [having] to look for US$1.4 million from our own pockets, but Sunexchange came in with an innovative way to fund it. In the province, we have been recognized as the best, and in the country we are the torchbearers. We have received lots of kudos and credibility on running our projects. It is the biggest solar crowd-funded project in Africa.
It has given us lots of publicity, credibility both in government and [with] investors [Cape Town-based financial services group] Old Mutual. We are now leading examples of going solar, growing blueberries using solar, chilling products using solar, and producing all our products from field to packing through solar. It's exciting!
pv mag: What is the pipeline for Nhimbe Fresh into the future?
EMM: Once the project is handed over to Sunexchange, we will move to phase two. In phase two, we will power the pumps and use the irrigation for the farms. The first phase was for the packhouse. To make sure that the packhouse is chilled … farms closer to the packhouse are powered.
We have a 20-hectare global project next to the packhouse and another 10 hectares that will be added, powered by solar. In the first phase, tobacco, pack houses, houses nearby, and labor houses will all be powered by solar. Everything in the first phase is now fully powered by solar.
pv mag: What is next for The Sun Exchange?
AC: The completion of phase one was a massive milestone for Sunexchange. We are now looking into the second phase, which will have a crowd sale this year. We have demonstrated a global appetite for getting involved and making a project like this happen, which benefits job creation, sustainable development, energy security, and clean energy across the continent. We will soon launch a similar project in South Africa with a leading global farm. We are actively exploring opportunities in the rest of the continent with other leading agricultural farms.
pv mag: Is there anything else either of you would like to say?
AC: We have a new American partner platform, known as Energea, joining the Sunexchange funding community. Energea Global, a U.S. renewable energy developer, has access to hundreds of investors in the U.S., bringing in millions of dollars [to] our platform. This has enabled us to increase our ability to fund projects drastically. This year, we target at least 8MW of solar to be funded through this platform. We are now expecting to do bigger projects with more volume.
EMM: We are working with several small-scale farmers to reduce poverty. We have a group of farmers we have linked into the market as out-growers, which is an opportunity for us to expand the solar projects into … remote areas to help them use solar, since they have challenges accessing ZESA and cannot pay the bills. We want to expand this project and include small scale farmers, and we will spread this project across the country.

Nitricity is using solar electricity to extract nitrogen directly from our air to produce nitric acid, the most critical nutrient in fertilizer that plants use to grow everything we humans eat. The key features of the company’s product are the decarbonization, decentralization and privatization of fertilizer manufacturing, made possible by affordable, off-grid, intermittent solar electricity.

The company installed its first commercial project in October. The off-grid solar power system features 144 solar panels, but details describing the solar hardware are scant. On its website, Nitricity shares an experimental report on its pilot project in Fresno, California. The initial installation’s solar system was a 16-panel ground-mount array that outputted 75V to 85V, with a maximum power of 2.4kW.
The installation was coupled directly with a sub-surface irrigation system for a tomato crop. The paper covers the apparent success of the hardware, which produced tomatoes in a volume and quality that were similar to the control tomatoes. The control tomatoes received a standard, industrially produced nitrogen fertilizer.
Pilot project
Nitricty believes that its product will fill several niches. Because the system is easily distributed, farmers located far from fertilizer manufacturing centers will have additional financial incentive to try out the new technology.
The company’s process directly competes with industrial ammonia production – a process which directly creates more CO2 than any other human-driven chemical process on earth. The primary feedstock for modern nitrogen fixation is natural gas. The processing of the gas into ammonia releases these emissions. The chemical process emissions are only part of the story, as the emissions released from the fossil fuels traditionally used to heat and sustain the reaction are also excessive.
In its favor, the Haber-Bosch process was largely responsible for the Green Revolution of the middle 1900s, which helped catapult the global population. It is estimated that nearly half of all nitrogen currently found in human tissue was produced using this process.
Additionally, Niticity’s distributed, localized nitrogen solution also avoids transportation emissions. The company points out that market inefficiencies related to the distribution process of fossil-sourced nitrogen fertilizers can increase a farmer’s fertilizer cost as much as two to five times above the costs at a factory. Fossil-based fertilizer production costs are also volatile due to their direct relationship with natural gas – which, as mentioned earlier, supplies the primary feedstock for industrial ammonia.

In December, the US Department of Energy’s ARPA Energy awarded the group $500,000 to advance their “non-thermal plasma reactor” process. ARPA notes that “literature and modeling analysis suggest that an energy efficiency 10 times better than present plasma values and equal to or better than that of the conventional Haber-Bosch process could be achieved.”
In an interview with Agrifood Conversations, the company noted that the intermittent nature of solar power is not only easily managed, but is actually a desired trait. According to one of Nitricity’s founders, Nicolas Pinkowski, the process “operates better intermittently. Because we manufacture nitrates (NO3-), there is a lot of oxygen to transport per lb of nitrogen.” Nitricity uses a 200-gallon tank to store the product prior to it being applied to the tomatoes.
In August, the company raised $5 million. Recently, Nitricity announced that it signed a deal with a wheat producer by releasing some emissions-focused math:
Nitricity’s technology mitigates nearly 100% of these emissions.
It could be that these fertilization systems will integrate with solar powered greenhouses and other responsible land management techniques. In doing so, solar power will likely prove to be indispensable to our future food production.

State-owned NTPC Ltd, India’s largest integrated energy producer, has invited bids to develop 900MW of solar parks in the Republic of Cuba. The solar parks will be spread across 175 locations in the island nation's 15 provinces. Cuba is a member of the Gurugram, India-headquartered International Solar Alliance (ISA) of 121 tropical nations.
The Cuban government, through its Ministry of Energy and Mines (MINEM), has sought support from the ISA for development of the solar generation capacity.
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for this year look even more promising.
NTPC has power generation capacity of 67.9GW across coal, gas, hydro, solar, and wind plants and is an ISA corporate partner. The energy company was chosen as preferred partner to help with implementation of the Cuban solar project last year. 
India's former National Thermal Power Company and state-owned Cuban utility Union Electrica de Cuba will work together to bring the Cuban solar capacity to fruition.
Under the auspices of the the International Solar Alliance, implementation partner and ISA project manager NTPC will help the Cuban power company and ministry of energy with the selection of solar project developers and the signing of project agreements and will oversee overseeing project implementation.
With Cuba aiming for 2.1GW of solar capacity under its current national ambition, it has been estimated the 900MW of solar will generate 2.16TWh of solar power per year.
The request for qualification process, to be considered as a developer, is expected to run from March until May.
The 900MW of solar envisaged in Cuba would take the volume of capacity NTPC is helping to install under its ISA role to more than 1.8GW as the power company is already helping bring about 500MW of photovoltaics in Mali, 100MW in Malawi, 285MW in Togo, and 50MW in Niger.
The utility is aiming to assist the development of around 10GW of solar in ISA member states and is also working on providing community-centered solar to such nations.

“SKI was an early mover in Italy’s solar development market when they were founded in 2018,” the Head of Renewable Power Development – EMEA at Shell, Roberto Jimenez, told pv magazine. “SKI has a portfolio of projects at different stages of approval and development, coupled with an experienced staff, that complement Shell’s existing solar development pipeline and capabilities in Italy.
According to Jimenez, the acquisition of SKI aligns with Shell’s strategy for integrated power and energy solutions delivery in Italy and the deal complements its current activities with 750 MW of solar projects. “The acquisition increases Shell’s solar development pipeline in Italy to approximately 2GW and supports Shell’s global ambition to supply customers with renewable power,” the company said in a statement.
The SKI projects are located in Apulia, Basilicata, Lazio, and Molise regions. Shell also has projects in other regions of Italy, including Veneto, Sicily and Sardinia. “The projects are in development,” Jimenez further explained. “Subject to regulatory approvals and final investment decisions, we expect some of the projects to begin construction in early 2023.”
Shell is planning to offer these projects to its commercial and industrial customers for corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs).
“The 10-person SKI team will be integrated into Shell Italy and bring valuable experience in agrivoltaic project development,” said Ivan Niosi, Head of Renewables Power Development Shell Italy and newly appointed CEO of solar-konzept Italia. “The team will develop the combined portfolio, continue to pursue new projects, and support our corporate power purchase agreement (PPA) offerings to customers.”
Shell has a power trading and supply business in Italy with a portfolio of about 500 large industrial customers. The company is developing solutions for electric charging and energy storage and recently signed an agreement with gas grid operator Snam and the National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA) for the hydrogen supply chain and other decarbonization solutions.
Shell recently acquired American solar and storage project developer Savion LLC from the Green Investment Group owned by Australian investor Macquarie.
The energy company in October announced it aims to halve its CO2 emissions – compared to its 2016 performance – this decade, including the removal of emissions from all its owned or controlled assets and from the electricity it purchases. In February, it also announced a plan to attain net-zero carbon operations by mid-century.

“We cladded the entire façade with photovoltaics, maximizing the energy gains to make it not only self-sustainable, for its own usage, but also allowing the building to become a tool of energy production, exporting electricity to the rest of the grid,” said MVRDV founding partner Winy Maas.
The Sun Rock building is located at the Changhua Coastal Industrial Park, near Taichung, and its primary purpose is for the storage and maintenance of sustainable energy equipment. “The site for Taipower’s new facility receives a significant amount of solar exposure throughout the year, and so the rounded shape of Sun Rock is designed to maximize how much of that sunlight can be harnessed for energy,” MVRDV said in a statement.

According to the company, the solar array is exposed to higher radiation on the southern side during the middle of the day, while electricity generation is maximized by the northern side in the mornings and evenings.
The BIPV system was built with a series of pleats that support photovoltaic panels and the modules mixed in with windows, where required, on their upper surface.
“The angle of these pleats is adjusted on all parts of the façade to maximize the energy-generating potential of the solar panels,” MVRDV explained. “As a result of these measures, the building can support at least 4,000 square meters of PV panels that would generate almost 1 million kilowatt-hours of clean energy per year.”

Floating photovoltaics (FPV), or “floatovoltaics,” are expected to establish a new global market by 2026, said Global Industry Analysts (GIA). It has projected 4.8 GW of deployment by that year.
FPV typically features solar panels mounted on a floating structure over a lake or reservoir, often with embedded trackers. It removes the added costs of purchasing or leasing expensive land areas. It also frees up more land area for other uses. And, water bodies are often government-owned, which is a feature that makes permitting easier to obtain, said GIA.
Generally, 1MW of FPV plant covers water bodies of about 17 to 25 acres and can generate electricity of 1,500MWh, said GIA
While FPV projects often don’t reach the same level power output of ground mounts, they serve land-restricted areas. The systems can offer environmental benefits like managing algal growth and reducing evaporation. Water offers system benefits like cooling the panels, which can reduce degradation and lower maintenance costs, said the report.
The market is currently about 1.6 GW globally, and GIA predicts it will move at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.7% by 2026, reaching 4.8 GW. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to be the largest market share at around 60%, with China the fastest growing market with a CAGR of 59.4%.  FPV’s cost is much higher that that of stationary solar panels, which is the key obstacle to its growth, said GIA.
GIA said the United States has more than 24,000 man-made water bodies that are anticipated to be useful in FPV development. Human-made water bodies are preferable for their ability to be managed, and most are located near existing infrastructure and roads.

The funding comes less than a year after 5B closed a AUD 12 million funding round, including investment support from former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Smart Energy Council Director Simon Holmes à Court. 
In December, 5B acquired an Adelaide manufacturing plant ahead of the global gigawatt-scale push of its rapidly deployable, modular, prefabricated Maverick solar arrays. In a statement, 5B said that its Maverick solution was already cost-competitive in Australia, as well as a number of other markets. It said that this program is designed to “leverage advanced automation to dramatically improve the scalability and cost of 5B's solution, enabling end customers to benefit from clean, solar energy at AUD 0.30 cents per watt installed by 2030.” 
This ambition requires a 35% cost reduction by 2023 and a 70% cost reduction by 2030 – both targets that 5B has said it is on track to meet. 
The company’s recently launched 50kW(DC) Maverick, optimized for the 550W module class, has already been installed in 52 projects in Australia, the United States, Latin America and India, for 32MW of total capacity. The Maverick arrays have proven popular with remote regions and mining operations, including a 12 MW system which it delivered with Enerven for SA Water and a 4.3 MW project it delivered with independent power provider Nomadic Energy Australia for miner Northern Star Resources in Western Australia. 5B’s Maverick system is also the preferred technology for Sun Cable’s massive 17GW to 20GW solar farm being developed in the Northern Territory, with the intent to export solar power to Singapore via a subsea transmission cable.
5B plans to use approximately two-thirds of the AUSD 33.4 million investment for the design and construction of an Advanced Manufacturing Pilot Line (AMPL). With the final third, 5B says that it will use robots to install solar arrays using GPS-guided deployment (GGD) technology. That’s right, GPS-guided solar installation robots.
It is 5B’s claim that artificial intelligence-enabled solar installation is the next frontier of solar technology, an advance that would allow for faster, cheaper, safer and more efficient solar farm construction. 
“This program will drive a step change in our automation capability and enable local manufacturing in Australia,” says 5B Chief Operating Officer Nicole Kuepper-Russell. “We are grateful for ARENA’s support – investment like this is essential to realise the opportunity to build Australia’s reputation as a clean energy superpower, exporting cutting-edge clean technology to the world.” 
Of course, the Australian government’s Low Emissions Technology Statement’s (LETS) stretch goal of ultra low cost solar generation at AUD 15/MWh (approximately one-third of today’s cost), means that ARENA is more than willing to fund such projects of ambition like 5B’s. 
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said funding 5B would certainly help reduce the cost of solar. “While solar PV and wind are recognized as the lowest cost form of generation in Australia today, further cost reductions are required to optimise Australia’s transition to renewable electricity and to enable emerging industries such as renewable hydrogen and low emissions metals,” said Miller. “5B is an Australian success story at the forefront of solar innovation. Having started in 2013, they are now becoming leaders in locally manufactured ultra low cost solar products that could reshape our solar industry and achieve our important aim of AUD 0.30 per installed watt at utility scale by 2030.” 
The news comes only a week after  ARENA announced AUD 40 million in research and development funding up for grabs across two solar streams.
