It said prices rose in the April-June period due to a lack of new manufacturing capacity, pandemic measures, and power rationing, including in Sichuan province, where it has production lines. JinkoSolar was a victim of its own success in the second quarter, with adjusted net income for shareholders of CNY 368 million ($53.3 million) wiped out partly by a change in value of convertible bond commitments. Its rising stock price during the quarter meant investors ended up with a three-month loss of CNY 623 million, down from a CNY 28.9 million profit in the previous window. The mixed trading conditions have also prompted Jinko to alter its manufacturing capacity expansion plans. It now aims to have 60 GW of annual module lines this year, down from its initial 65 GW target. Cell capacity will still be expected to hit 55 GW, but wafer output is now set to reach 55 GW, rather than 60 GW.
Risen said it shipped 5.67 GW of modules in the first six months of 2022. It achieved revenue of CNY 12.62 billion, up 51.3% year on year. Net profit soared by 653.6% on the year to CNY 504 million. Sales of polysilicon hit CNY 977 million in the first half, at 4,987 metric tons (MT). Risen said it had a total PV module capacity of 22.1 GW and a polysilicon capacity of 12,000 MT per year by the end of June.
GoodWe said its first-half revenue hit CNY 145.2 million, up 33.6% year on year, on a net profit of CNY 54.6 million, down 64.3% on the year. The inverter maker sold 233,700 PV inverters in the first six months of the year. It attributed the sharp decrease in profit to higher semiconductor prices and logistics costs.
TBEA posted CNY 38.8 billion of revenue in the first half of the year, up 72.2% year on year. It recorded a profit of CNY 6.9 billion, up 122.3% from the same period a year earlier. It produced 46,200 MT of polysilicon and sold 47,700 MT, pushing sales revenue from polysilicon up 193.5% year on year to CNY 10.6 billion. TBEA estimates its total polysilicon output will reach 110,000 MT to 120,000 MT this year, and the figure is expected to grow to 240,000 MT to 250,000 MT in 2023.
Ginlong achieved revenue of CNY 2.44 billon in the first half, up 68% year on year. It recorded a profit of CNY 398 million, up 67.2% year on year. Solar inverters accounted for 74.1% of its total sales. It now has a total inverter capacity of 770,000 units per year.
TCL is extending its move into rooftop solar by two years, following a successful pilot scheme. The strategy involves TCL installing rooftop PV panels for residential and commercial customers, arranging third-party finance, and dealing directly with customers. The pilot scheme, arranged between TCL Electronics Holdings and parent TCL Holdings, was due to run until the end of this year, but will now continue until the end of 2024, TCL Electronics said last week.
Solargiga posted a first-half profit of CNY 67.7 million, up from CNY 61.3 million in the first half of last year. Its ingot and wafer operations banked a profit of CNY 112 million in the January-June period. The company said its annual ingot manufacturing capacity will rise from 6.2 GW to 7.4 GW this year, with wafer output set to rise to 7.4 GW, from 4.5 GW at present. It said it expects PV module capacity to reach the 1 GW to 8.2 GW range.
Beijing Energy International generated a first-half net profit of CNY 286 million, down from CNY 361 million in January-June 2021. The state-owned renewables developer made no additions to its 97 solar plants during the period and saw the average electricity tariff banked by its solar dominated portfolio fall, year on year, from CNY 0.75 to CNY 0.60. The developer owes CNY 8.3 billion in yuan-denominated debt to creditors within 12 months and CNY 3.37 billion in US dollar commitments.
Shandong Hi-Speed New Energy Group reported a first-half profit of HKD 343 million ($43.7 million), down from HKD 418 million, year on year, from its 2,306 MW solar project portfolio. Revenue fell from HKD 3.02 billion in January-June 2021 to HK$ 2.94 billion in the first half of this year. The company, formerly known as Beijing Enterprises Clean Energy Group, said it is now exploring hydrogen production.
Flat Glass said last week that PV products accounted for CNY 1.49 billion of its first-half gross profit. It banked a net profit of CNY 1 billion, down from CBY 1.26 billion in the first half of last year. In the first quarter, Flat Glass completed two 1,200-ton-per-day melting capacity PV glass production lines in Jiaxing, Zhejiang, and cold-repaired an existing 600-ton line at the same site. The company financed the move with a convertible bond that raised CNY 3.98 billion and is now preparing a net CNY 6 billion non-public share issue.

By contrast, Sweden-based Vattenfall, which also operates in the country, has decided to increase the tariff from €0.07/kWh to €0.168/kWh.
“The Netherlands Authority for Consumers & Markets (ACM) had previously stated that this tariff must be at least 70% of the basic electricity prices,” the association said. “But pending new providions, these guidelines no longer applies. And energy companies make good use of this by paying consumers a lower fee.”
Sandra Molenaar, the director of Consumentenbond, said that the new provisions also set a new minimum. However, the law will not go into effect until 2025.
“We, therefore, call on the government to indicate exactly a minimum threshold as soon as possible, so that we don't have to wait for the new law to come into effect,” said Molenaar.
A recent study conducted by the association has also revealed that half of all energy suppliers offer an excessively low tariff for surplus solar power. Five suppliers even pay less than 15% of the basic electricity price.
According to Dutch solar analyst Peter Segaar, Dutch energy providers are currently awarding tariffs between €0.07/kWh and €0.66/kWh – a range he sees as appropriately remunerative.
“These are good prices for solar households, with which they can accomplish a relatively short pay-back time for their PV installations,” he told pv magazine. “All households that produce a surplus, do not pay any energy taxes or the so-called SDE levy, nor VAT, for their own yearly consumption. Besides, as a result of interventions by the fourth Rutte cabinet, due to the high market prices for electricity and gas, also all solar households, will receive a large amount of money from the Ministry of Finance this year, the so-called energy tax compensation. That amounts, currently, to a large sum, of almost €682 excluding VAT.”
In June, the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) began investigating whether energy suppliers are buying surplus solar power from prosumers under the nation's net-metering regime at lower tariffs than what is considered a “reasonable price.” According to the most recent statistics from the Central Agency for Statistics (CBS), at the end of 2021 there were around 1.58 million Dutch households that were equipped with rooftop PV systems.
The Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency recently estimated the country could reach 27 GW of installed PV capacity by 2030. The report’s authors said the planned phasing out of net metering for rooftop PV was more likely to influence the type of projects installed after 2023 than overall volumes.
The Netherlands reached a cumulative installed PV capacity of 14.3 GW at the end of 2021, according to the Dutch Central Agency for Statistics. The Dutch solar market grew by 3.3 GW of newly deployed capacity last year. By comparison, newly deployed PV systems hit 2.93 GW in 2020, 2.57 GW in 2019, 1.69 GW in 2018, and 853 MW in 2017.

First Solar has announced plans to invest up to $1.2 billion to scale up production of US-made solar modules – an investment that is forecast to expand the company’s ability to produce modules for the US solar market to more than 10 GW (DC) by 2025.
As part of its push to scale US production of solar modules, the company intends to build its fourth, fully vertically integrated domestic factory, with an annual capacity of 3.5 GW, in the southeastern United States. The company said it expects to invest up to $1 billion in the new factory, which, contingent upon permitting and pending approval of various federal, state, regional, and local incentives, is expected to begin operations in 2025.
In 2021, First Solar announced that it was building its Ohio facility, where the company produces its thin-film solar modules using a fully integrated process using cadmium telluride (CdTe) semiconductor. The company said that the Ohio plant is currently the largest vertically integrated complex of its kind in the Western Hemisphere. First Solar intends to invest $185 million to upgrade and expand its Ohio footprint by 0.9 GW.
The company said it will invest in the expansion of its two operating facilities in Perrysburg and Lake Township, Ohio, by 0.6 GW to 3.6 GW of annual Series 6 module capacity. And it will also expand its third Ohio factory, expected to be commissioned in the first half of 2023, to 3.5 GW of annual Series 7 module capacity. The expansion will increase First Solar’s total investment in its Ohio manufacturing facilities to over $3 billion, with a cumulative annual production capacity of more than 7 GW by 2025.
“In passing the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Congress and the Biden-Harris Administration has entrusted our industry with the responsibility of enabling America’s clean energy future and we must meet the moment in a manner that is both timely and sustainable,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer of First Solar. “This investment is an important step towards achieving self-sufficiency in solar technology, which, in turn, supports America’s energy security ambitions, its deployment of solar at scale, and its ability to lead with innovation.”
First Solar estimates that its new investment will add at least 850 manufacturing jobs, bringing its total number of direct jobs in the United States to more than 3,000 people in four states by 2025. By 2025, First Solar is also expected to support an estimated 15,000 indirect and induced jobs.
On its last earnings calls, First Solar announced that it had a backlog of bookings, after announcing several large orders for its advanced thin film solar modules. Silicon Ranch recently booked a 4 GW order, a National Grid order came in at 2 MW, and Intersect Power placed an order for 2.4 GW.
A long-time customer of First Solar’s, Intersect Power is expected to be one of the largest buyers and operators of First Solar technology by 2027.
“Intersect Power’s ongoing relationship with First Solar has been critical in rapidly scaling our business to meet our vision and reliably delivering our customers value and performance to support their decarbonization goals,” said Sheldon Kimber, chief executive officer of Intersect Power. “We look forward to bringing this large-scale portfolio to operation, and creating good-paying, American jobs in both construction and manufacturing with First Solar’s domestically-produced modules.”
In addition to its Ohio manufacturing facilities, First Solar also operates factories in Vietnam and Malaysia, and is building its first new manufacturing facility in India, which is scheduled to begin operations in the second half of 2023. When expansion in the United States and India is complete, the company expects to have more than 20 GW of annual global manufacturing capacity in 2025.
The company also continues innovate its process, optimizing the amount of semiconductor material used. First Solar also operates an advanced recycling program that enables materials to be re-used in new modules.

“Our system was conceived to utilize unused water pipes and is aimed at reducing electricity bills in commercial and industrial buildings,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The system can be used in different kinds of commercial and industrial buildings, provided a few conditions are met. For example, a minimum flow rate of 4L/s and a water drop from a height of more than 4 meters. And if these conditions are met, it may even be installed in residential buildings or houses.
The device measures 580 mm x 330 mm and weighs 30 kg, with a nominal power of 2.7 kW. It uses the difference in water pressure in the piping to generate power and can work only with sealed piping. The water wheel rotation speed ranges from 450 to 5,000 rpm and the rotation speed, at a head of 24 meters, spans 5,000 rpm when unrestrained to 2,800 rpm when outputting 2.5 kW.

“The system can also be used in combination with solar,” the spokesperson explained. “It is also possible to use solar power during the day and hydropower at night. Both can be operated, and by storing the generated electricity in a storage battery, you can use it at any time you like.”
The system can provide power for outdoor and office lighting, as well as for surveillance cameras. The company sells the standard model at a price of JPY 980,000 ($7,080). Payback times have been estimated between eight and nine years, while the expected lifecycle is 20 years.
“The only replacement parts are mechanical seals and bearings, but it may be necessary to replace them once every 20 years or not,” the spokesperson said. “As for the warranty, it is currently only available in Japan for one year. For overseas sales, only initial defects will be exchanged.”

Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, said this week that the company’s 10 GW solar cell and module factory in Jamnagar, Gujarat, will start production by 2024. The group will then scale its annual output capacity to 20 GW by 2026 in a phased manner.
Reliance Industries said it will use REC Solar‘s technology for solar manufacturing at the Jamnagar factory. 
“This will be a first-of-its-kind of ‘quartz-to-module’ facility globally,” said Ambani, addressing the company's annual general meeting (AGM) this week.
He said Reliance Industries would also invest in glass and POE film manufacturing. It claims to have a defined technology improvement roadmap to stay ahead in PV manufacturing.
“We target to increase the HJT module efficiency to 26% by 2026 from the current 23%, and further improve it to 28% through innovations like perovskite-tandem cell technology,” said Ambani. 
Reliance Industries also aims to extend the lifetime of PV modules from 25 to 50 years, to set a high benchmark for quality and reliability. In June 2021, the company announced plans to manufacture and fully integrate all the critical components of the renewable energy ecosystem. The plan included gigafactories for PV panels, energy storage, electrolyzers for green hydrogen, and fuel cells.
A spree of mergers and acquisitions has since marked Reliance Industries’ foray into those segments. For solar PV manufacturing, it acquired a 100% stake in REC Solar and its heterojunction solar panels. Ambani said Reliance Industries aims to make India a world leader in new energy manufacturing, as well as a credible alternative to China.
“We are well on our way to creating a manufacturing ecosystem [in the new energy segment], which will be fully integrated with secure and self-sufficient supply chains,” he said. “It will be backed by world-class talent and capabilities, built on the pillars of technological innovation through strategic partnerships. It will deliver modular, world-scale, affordable, and most modern green energy manufacturing business based in India, for India and the world.”
Ambani also announced a new gigafactory for power electronics – one of the key components linking the entire value chain of green energy.
“We are building significant capabilities in design and manufacturing of power electronics and software systems, integrating with our capabilities of telecommunications, cloud computing and IoT,” said Ambani. “[Reliance Industries] aims to start production of battery packs by 2023 and scale up to a fully integrated 5 GWh annual cell-to-pack manufacturing facility by 2024, and further scale up to 50 GWh annual capacity by 2027.” 
For green hydrogen, Reliance Industries has partnered with Stiesdal to accelerate cost reduction and commercialization of their pressurized alkaline electrolyzer technology.
“We are also in advanced discussions to partner with other leading electrolyzer technology players globally to set up a giga-scale electrolyzer manufacturing facility at Jamnagar,” said Ambani.

M. Chikao and other researchers at Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology first created an optical absorption layer using a perovskite crystal structure in 1999. Nearly 25 years later, researchers are still working to stabilize solar degradation.
This time around, researchers from multiple universities across the Mediterranean built and deployed a perovskite solar panel that lasted about nine months. The panels degraded approximately 25% from their original output, before experiencing a catastrophic encapsulation failure. This led to a mechanical panel failure, as the elements rapidly wore down the perovskites.
In “Integration of two-dimensional materials-based perovskite solar panels into a stand-alone solar farm,” thre researchers described how the collaboration went about fully constructing nine 0.5 square-meter perovskite solar panels. The panels were composed of 40 individual “modules” (the authors use the term “modules,” but we will use the term “‘cell”), with the array peaking at 261 watts of output, while individual cells ranged in output from 25 W to 35 W. The authors reported that the 360 solar cells, measured at 1 sun irradiation, were 12.5%±1.6 efficient.
The authors also provided a supplemental document that broke down all of the ingredients that go into making one of their solar panels, even including the electricity consumed in manufacturing, (approximately 11.25 kWh). The panels were named “GRAPE” because the “PE”rovskite was complemented by “GRA”phene.
After being deployed in June, the panel peaked above 250 watts of output – as can be seen in the lower right, image C. The panel saw an immediate drop in output, followed by a stable month, and then a slow, but fairly steady decrease in peak output, down 20%, going into the January-February period. At that point, output degradation sharply accelerated, and was followed by a total lamination failure, allowing for the ingress of oxygen and water.
The team suggests that the lamination failure was due to their use of the low temperature laminate (85 °C) chosen to seal solar cells within the panel frame. A low temperature laminate was chosen as a way to avoid damaging the temperature-sensitive perovskites in the lamination process, since the degradation of perovskites is accelerated at higher temperatures.
One very interesting observation is that output losses were roughly zero as temperatures increased to 50°C, and beyond. The author’s state, “contrary to many semiconductors, in which the optical band gap (EG) decreases almost linearly with the temperature increase associated with solar cell operation, halide perovskites have a positive correlation between the optical band gap and the temperature.”
The authors explain that gains resulting from the increased optical band gap were likely offset by a number of uncertain factors, which should be examined in future research. Generally, at 50 C, one would expect the efficiency of a silicon solar panel to be down 7.5% to 15% from its peak output.

In February, pv magazine reported on Project Nexus, which planned to install solar panels over California canals. Now that project is about to move forward with, groundbreaking planned for the fall.
The Turlock Irrigation District (TID) is partnering with the Department of Water Resource (DWR), Solar AquaGrid, and the University of California, Merced in the project funded by the State of California. The project will include energy storage to study how storage facilities can support the local electric grid when solar generation is lowered due to cloud cover.
The concept of solar on California canals grew out of a 2021 study conducted at the University of California, Merced and University, Santa Cruz, which showed that covering the approximately 4,000 miles of public water delivery system infrastructure in California with solar panels can generate 13 GW of energy annually, equal to about one sixth of the state’s current installed capacity and about half the projected new capacity needed to meet the state’s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030.
“Solar canals are an example of an energy-water nexus that offer multiple sustainability benefits. Using water canals for solar infrastructure conserves water while producing renewable electricity and avoids converting large tracts of land to solar development,” said Dr. Brandi L. McKuin, the lead author of the study.
The study suggests that 63 billion gallons of water could be saved annually by covering canals, which is enough to irrigate 50,000 acres of farmland or meet the water needs of more than 2 million residents. The project will show how covering canals reduces evaporation as well as possibly improve water quality and reduce vegetative growth.
“Research and common sense tell us that in an age of intensifying drought, it’s time to put a lid on evaporation,” said Jordan Harris, CEO of Solar AquaGrid. “Our initial study revealed mounting solar panels over open canals can result in significant water, energy, and cost savings when compared to ground-mounted solar systems, including added efficiency resulting from an exponential shading/cooling effect. Now is the chance to put that learning to the test.”
In addition to studying energy generation on canals as well as benefits to water levels and quality, the project offers an opportunity to study a variety of solar panels and inverters to see how they work when installed over or near the water. Various forms of energy storage will also be studied.
Project Nexus is expected to be complete in 2024 at multiple locations throughout the TID service territory.

The battery relies on two electrodes made of aluminum and sulfur and a molten salt electrolyte placed between them. The electrolyte was composed of sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), and aluminum chloride (AlCl3), and formulated with high levels of AlCl3.
“We demonstrate that these are the key to supporting ultrafast electrodeposition of aluminium (cell charging) while vitiating dendrite formation,” the scientists said, in reference to the three compounds.
They are extremely cheap and earth-abundant compared to lithium, nickel, cobalt and graphite used in lithium-ion batteries.
“The chloro-aluminate salt that we chose essentially retired runaway dendrites, while also allowing for very rapid charging,” Sadoway explained. “We did experiments at very high charging rates, charging in less than a minute, and we never lost cells due to dendrite shorting.”
The researchers said the sulfur electrodes with a high loading of 12.0 mg cm2 can sustain a high capacity of 520 mAh g–1 more than 100 cycles at 5 C.
“We attribute full accessibility of electrode capacity to the advantageously low surface tension of the chloroaluminate melt,” they said.
The US team described the technology in “Fast-charging aluminum–chalcogen batteries resistant to dendritic shorting,” which was recently published in nature.
“Our battery has a two-fold economic promise. First, given the high earth abundance of all components, aluminum, sulfur, NaCl, KCl and AlCl 3, the estimated cell-level cost of our Al–S battery is as low as $8.99 per kWh, which is 12% to 16% of that of today’s lithium-ion batteries,” the academic said. “We also show that the use of low-grade aluminum (for example, food-packaging foil) in the negative electrode does not result in appreciable deterioration in cell performance.”
The research team included members from Peking University, Yunnan University, the Wuhan University of Technology, the University of Louisville, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the University of Waterloo.
