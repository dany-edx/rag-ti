And discussions at the event were held with some urgency. This year’s siliconPV coincided with the publication in Science of a paper authored by many of the leading figures in the global solar industry and research community, titled “Photovoltaics at terawatt scale: Waiting is not an option.”
Drawing on this publication in his opening speech, conference chair Arthur Weeber of Dutch research organization TNO noted that the world will need to have 75 TW of PV installed by 2050, and that it should be defined by the EU as a technology of high strategic importance in order to accelerate efforts to bring full value chain manufacturing back to the region.
Weeber went on to note that industrially, solar is at a turning point with the current generation of PERC technology set to disappear almost entirely by 2025. And the n-type technologies replacing it are a big step forward, but we’ll need modules with at least 30% efficiency to reach 2050 renewable energy goals.
The conference proceeded on this urgent note, and a close link between the PV researchers and industry was far more evident than it has been in previous years, where the transfer to larger scale felt like little more than a dot on the horizon.
Much of the work presented this year, however, focused on processes and solutions that would be suitable for industrial use. Those where it was less obvious were invariably followed by a barrage of questions on larger device size, industrial applicability, material usage and more.
In some ways, the situation is reversed – with researchers having to keep up with moves the industry has made more rapidly than expected. Gallium doping as a solution to mitigate light-elevated temperature induced degradation (more on this later) was taken up by virtually the whole industry within about a year, and researchers are still at work examining possible broader impacts. Meanwhile, many laboratories seem still to be working on older cell formats of 166 mm or smaller, while commercial formats now are almost all based on 182 mm or 210 mm products.
Sticking with the trend of industrial awareness, SiliconPV this year revealed a strong focus on ending solar’s reliance on rare or expensive materials that don’t lend themselves to the industry’s model of growing scale and shrinking costs.
In Thursday morning’s session on heterojunction technology, four out of six presentations looked at ways to reduce or remove indium from the materials list, with a range of innovative solutions on offer: Tristan Gageot of CEA Ines spoke of challenges in slimming down the indium tin oxide layer from 20 nm to 15, 10 or even 5nm. And Anamaria Steinmetz of Fraunhofer ISE presented a cell that could do away with indium entirely. Both of these researchers rely on adding a nanocrystalline silicon layer to the stack to achieve this, which remains a promising approach but one that’s difficult to implement in a large-scale deposition process.
Already better documented is the need to cut silver out of all types of solar cells. Copper, or silver coated copper, have seen much progress as replacements. It was interesting to note this year that more work focused on aluminium pastes, which have the advantages of further industrial development, and that they can be used in the same screen printing processes cell makers have long used.
In highlight sessions on the first morning of the conference, Wolfram Kwapil of Freiburg University described light elevated temperature induced degradation (LETID) as “the phenomenon of the PERC era, and Manchester University’s Tarek Abdul Fattah outlined the current state of the art – we know that the LETID mechanism involves hydrogen  atoms, and is affected by properties of the dopant, but little else is agreed upon.
The switch to gallium doping certainly makes cells less susceptible to performance loss from LETID, but cannot be said to eliminate it completely. Various alterations to the firing process in cell production have also been shown to improve LETID performance, but there’s still work to be done.
Fully explaining that mechanisms behind LETID has become a major goal for PV researchers. Also presented was a range of sophisticated models to explain the performance loss as well as sophisticated imaging techniques aiming to track the behaviour of hydrogen atoms in the material.
Bram Hoex, from the University of New South Wales, also shared new work on potential-induced degradation, noting that this has been an increasing problem in the past few years thanks to bifacial modules and a degradation mechanism particularly affecting the rear side. Hoex warned that newer TOPcon and HJT modules may also be more susceptible to PID than the current generation of modules and outlined a new testing protocol to detect it early on.
In his keynote speech at this year’s conference, Rutger Schlatmann of Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin noted that PV efficiency has increased on average by 0.6% per year since the first cells were made in the 1960s. He described perovskite-silicon tandem cells as “the missing link” to keeping the technology on this trajectory, further noting that the knowledge to do this was very much present in Europe.
A later session on research into tandem cells revealed more of the earlier mentioned closer link to industry. Much of the work here focused on further optimization of silicon cell processing for integration with another top cell, with the addition of a nickel-oxide layer mentioned by a few researchers as a potentially useful innovation.

Engie Energía Chile, a subsidiary of French energy company Engie, has started operating Coya, its largest solar park in Chile. The plant is located in María Elena, Antofagasta province.
The facility consists of 369,432 PV panels equipped with a robotic cleaning system from Israeli company Ecoppia. The plant will feed power into the National Electric System (SEN), supplying energy to 73,000 homes. The company is also now constructing a 638 MWh battery storage system, the BESS Coya project.
Engie Chile CEO Rosaline Corinthien said that “by obtaining the COD for our Coya Solar Plant, the first stage of our transformation plan is closed, with solar and wind plants that already add around 800 MW of renewable energy to the system … Now begins a second stage that consists of adding new technologies to the development of projects, as is the case of storage systems.”
Engie recently connected the 88 MW Capricornio array and the 114 MW Tamaya solar plant to the SEN.

During the fabrication of solar panels, silicon goes through several high-temperature processes known as annealing. Currently the cells are cooked in an oven. But in a recent paper in Applied Physics Letters, a team led by senior lecturer Binesh P Veettil show that heating with microwave radiation is nearly as efficient, while saving considerable time and energy and offering other advantages.
Microwave radiation selectively heats silicon, leading to almost instantaneous effects with massive savings of energy, said the researchers.
“The microwave annealing of semiconductor devices has not been extensively researched and is rarely utilized in industry, yet it has the potential to significantly reduce the time and cost associated with large-volume semiconductor processing, such as the various heating and annealing processes required in the manufacture of photovoltaic modules,” wrote the researchers.
The paper describes microwave annealing of silicon solar cells, the effective passivation of light-induced defects, and a reduction in light-induced degradation. The researchers found that silicon solar cells are heated rapidly in a microwave field and that effective boron-oxygen defect passivation can be achieved by microwave processing in less than two seconds. Microwave annealing yields similar results as compared to rapid thermal annealing, they found.
The use of microwave radiation leaves the rest of the laminated panel of glass, plastic and aluminium largely unaffected. That property has led to an unexpected recycling benefit, for which the group has a patent pending.
The microwave treatment softens the plastic (ethylene vinyl acetate) coating that protects the silicon plate from moisture and contamination, making it possible to peel it off mechanically. The plate can therefore be easily delaminated and its components reused without employing harsh chemicals.
“Until now it made economic sense to just dump the panels in the landfill,” Veettil said. “In the rare instances when they are recycled, you crush the panels, heat them to about 1,400 C and wash them with chemicals to remove the plastic – a highly energy-demanding process. But now, as the solar panels which began to be installed in vast numbers about 20 to 30 years ago are reaching the end of their life and being decommissioned, governments are demanding they be recycled.”
Other advantages offered by microwave annealing include the ability to focus microwave radiation. The heating it induces can be selective and highly tuned. The researchers note, for example, that better-directed annealing is highly advantageous in newer panels that feature heterojunction technology, in which crystalline and amorphous silicon are interleaved.
“Precise focusing also means that annealing can be directed to specific parts of the solar panel, making it ideal for annealing solar panels with more intricate internal structures fabricated for special purposes,” the team adds.
In contrast to an oven, in which all kinds of chemical substances are shed from the walls, microwave annealing takes place in a clean environment. “So there is less contamination,” Veettil explained. “And the whole process can all be undertaken at room temperature.”
There are several other projects involving solar cells and sustainable energy underway at Macquarie. One of the co-authors of the annealing paper, Shujuan Huang, leads a group examining microwave annealing in perovskite solar cells. In this case, microwave radiation produced more efficient solar cells compared to conventional annealing methods, but the reason is not clear. The researchers are currently looking to solve that mystery.
Veettil’s research in collaboration with the school of photovoltaics at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, was initiated with funding from the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics and further supported by the Australian government through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency.

Large-scale solar farms in New South Wales flooded the utility-scale PV generation rankings in March, with international consultancy Rystad Energy noting that seven of Australia’s top 10 best-performing assets are all located in the eastern Australian state.
Rystad Energy Senior Renewables Analyst David Dixon said SUN Energy’s 100 MW Merredin Solar Farm in Western Australia topped the rankings with an average capacity factor of 34.6% for the month. However, facilities in New South Wales had dominated the charts, generating a combined 518 GWh over the course of the month.
Canadian clean energy investor Amp Energy’s 120 MW Hillston Solar Farm in the Riverina region of southwest New South Wales was second in the generation performance rankings, with a capacity factor of 34% across March. French renewable-energy developer Neoen’s 36 MW Giffith Solar Farm, also in the Riverina region, was third with a 30.9% capacity factor.
Sydney-based solar data specialist Solcast, which uses weather data and modelling tools to optimise solar PV systems, said the performance ratings coincided with the demise of the La Nina weather pattern, which typically brings increased cloud cover and rain to Australia.

Jack said the southern parts of Western Australia also saw higher solar irradiance due to less high cloud than usual. Solcast Lead Modeller Harry Jack said the end of the La Nina event meant that most of Australia saw an increase in solar irradiance, compared to long-term averages.
“Summer monsoon activity was reduced in general and focused primarily over the Gulf of Carpentaria and inland Queensland during March, so this region saw the biggest drop from its usual average irradiance,” he said. “The remainder of northern Australia was left with less cloud and therefore higher irradiance than normal, following the end of the La Nina event. In particular, the east coast of Queensland saw irradiance up to 20% above average.”

The LCOE report then analyses the levelized cost of green and pink hydrogen using PEM and alkaline electrolyzers under unsubsidized and subsidized scenarios. LCOH for green hydrogen with PEM electrolyzers goes from $0.48 to $1.81 with subsidies and is in the range of $2.75 to $4.08 without subsidies. LCOH for green hydrogen with alkaline electrolyzers goes from $1.16 to $2.99 with subsidies and is in the range of $3.47 to $5.29 without subsidies. LCOH for pink hydrogen with PEM electrolyzers goes from $0.83 to $2.83 with subsidies and is in the range of $3.79 to $5.78 without subsidies. LCOH for pink hydrogen with alkaline electrolyzers goes from $1.68 to $4.28 with subsidies and is in the range of $4.77 to $7.37 without subsidies. The report also explained that “while hydrogen-ready natural gas turbines are still being tested, preliminary results, including our illustrative LCOH analysis, indicate that a 25% hydrogen by volume blend is feasible and cost competitive.”
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has announced AUD 50 million ($34 million) for two funding rounds targeting research and development for renewable hydrogen and low-emission iron and steel. “Funding for successful research and development projects will be provided over two phases, with an initial laboratory-based research phase followed by a commercialization phase aimed at scaling up and demonstrating research breakthroughs,” said ARENA. AUD 25 million will be allocated to each of the funding rounds, with grant funding for successful applicants expected to range between AUD 500,000 and AUD 5 million.
Australia is facing competition in the hydrogen race from other countries that have stimulated their industries through subsidies. Australia is now seeking to create an enabling investment environment through the provision of enhanced regulatory certainty and the development of a domestic hydrogen guarantee of origin scheme as well as grants, incentives, and access to lower interest financing via the Clean Energy Finance Corporation's AUD 300 million ($202 million) Advancing Hydrogen Fund. “Australia’s announced pipeline of over 100 hydrogen projects is worth around AUD 230-300 billion of potential investment. This represents close to 40% of all global clean hydrogen project announcements, and underlines Australia’s potential to be among the global leaders,” said Chris Bowen, Australia’s minister for Climate Change and Energy, in the State of Hydrogen 2022 publication. The report explains that, as of December 2022, only one project with a 10 MW capacity or higher has passed FID from this pipeline of investment.
Hopium said it wants to prioritize the development of its technology to capitalize on its expertise quickly, while “keeping the Hopium Machina in sight.” The French company reorganized its activities around two divisions: Hopium Technologies, which develops the fuel cell for the professional market, and Hopium Automotive, whose mission is to develop a range of hydrogen vehicles for the general public.
Toyota announced releasing details for three new Crown models. One of them, the Sedan Crown car, is a hydrogen fuel cell model. The car is expected to be launched in autumn 2023. The new model will be the company’s second FCEV offering after Toyota Miral.

Ecuador's Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) has allocated 120 MW of PV capacity in its latest 500 MW renewable energy auction, which was launched in December 2021. It originally preselected 345.3 MW of PV projects and accepted six bids for solar plants ranging in size from 3 MW to 50 MW.
For solar, five of the six participating developers proposed 60 MW projects. Intiyana submitted an offer of $0.049877/kWh and AMBI presented a bid of $0.049876/kWh. Imbabura Solar, Ñañapura, and Dominion offered $0.0535977/kWh, $0.05961/kWh, $0.066988/kWh, respectively. Esco As submitted a 60 MW solar project to sell power at $0.064985/kWh.
Only two of these projects were ultimately selected in the procurement exercise – Dominion's plant for $0.066988/kWh and Esco's project offer of $0.064985/kWh.
The MEM also allocated 150 MW of hydropower capacity, 200 MW of installed wind power, and 30 MW of biomass capacity. It said it will award 25-year PPAs to the wind and solar projects and 30-year deals to the hydroelectric facilities.

The report offers a comparative LCOE analysis for various generation technologies on a $/MWh basis, with exceptions for US federal tax subsidies, fuel prices, carbon pricing, and the cost of capital. The report also includes a cost-of-firming-intermittency analysis for the first time. Unlike in previous years, the LCOE for utility-scale solar omits thin-film technology and only focuses on crystalline silicon.
In a base comparison, without considering subsidies, fuel prices, or carbon pricing, utility-scale solar and wind have the lowest LCOE of all sources. Utility-scale solar PV comes in anywhere from $24/MWh to $96/MWh, while onshore wind registers the lowest possible LCOE over the shortest range, from $24/MWh to $75/MWh. Offshore wind’s LCOE ranges between $72/MWh and $140/MWh.
For comparison, under the same criteria, gas peaking comes in at $115/MWh to $221/MWh, nuclear is $141/MWh to $221/MWh, coal is $68/MWh to $166/MWh, and gas combined cycle is $39/MWh to $ 101/MWh, according to Lazard.
Unsubsidized residential rooftop PV has an LCOE between $117/MWh and $282/MWh, while the LCOE of community and commercial and industrial (C&I) solar ranges between $49/MWh and $185/MWh. When factoring in federal tax subsidies under the US Inflation Reduction Act, including domestic contest provisions, rooftop PV comes in at $74/MWh to $229/MWh, and community/C&I rooftop PV at $32/MWh to $155/MWh.
For the first time in the history of Lazard’s analysis, the average LCOE for both utility-scale PV and onshore wind increased. Inflation, supply chain challenges, and the global energy crisis all had a role to play in putting a stop to solar’s “race to the bottom.” Nevertheless, Lazard notes that “the LCOE of the best-in-class onshore wind and utility-scale solar has declined at the low-end of our cost range, the reasons for which could catalyze ongoing consolidation across the sector.”
For utility-scale PV, the LCOE range in 2021 was very small, at $30/MWh to $41/MWh. In 2023, it ranged from $24/MWh to $96/MWh, thereby increasing the average LCOE.
Lazard estimates that between 2016 and 2023, utility-scale PV’s LCOE increased by 3%, calculated as the average percentage increase of the high-end and low-end of the LCOE range. Between 2009 and 2023, however, solar’s LCOE decreased by 84% according to the same metric.
The new report also includes an analysis of the levelized cost of storage and hydrogen, which pv magazine will cover in separate articles.

Germany's Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) has allocated 1,952 MW of PV capacity in the nation's first tender for utility-scale solar this year. The capacity was assigned across 245 bids and slightly exceeds the 1,950 MW that the Bundesnetzagentur had planned to allocate. The tender was significantly oversubscribed, with 347 project proposals totaling 2,869 MW.
The agency had set a ceiling price of €0.0737 ($0.081)/kWh for the auction. The final average price came in at €0.0703/kWh, with final prices ranging from €0.0529/kWh and €0.0730/kWh.
The southern state of Bavaria secured the largest share of allocated capacity with 845 MW, followed by Brandenburg with 223 MW and Rhineland-Palatinate with 163 MW.
The Bundesnetzagentur also revealed that around 851 MW were assigned for projects on arable land and grasslands in disadvantaged areas. Another 755 MW were awarded for PV projects along motorways and railways, it said.
“For the first time since June 2022, the amount of bids received has significantly exceeded the amount of planned capacity,” said Klaus Müller, the president of the Bundesnetzagentur. “Never before have so many bids been submitted in such a tender by the Federal Network Agency. It is now a matter of maintaining this high level of bids in order to push ahead with the necessary expansion in the long term.”
The agency allocated 609 MW of solar capacity in the previous large-scale PV tender. It was undersubscribed and concluded with a final average price of €0.0580/kWh, up slightly from €0.0510/kWh in the last procurement round. Bids ranged from €0.0520/kWh to €0.0590/kWh.
The Bundesnetzagentur will hold the next tender for ground-mounted PV on July 1. It says that it hopes to allocate 1,611 MW. It says it will also accept project proposals for solar plants with capacities of up to 100 MW for the first time.

“The system consists of a vertical axis wind turbine with a modified helical Savonius shape and a base with four monocrystalline panels,” CEO Serkan Kilic told pv magazine.”It has a roof load of 131 kg/m2.”
The solar base consists of a structure made of galvanized steel and rubber. It measures 1.14 m x 1.14 m x 20 mm and weighs 35 kg. It can host four solar panels with power outputs of 30 W each. It includes four Eco Line ES30M36 modules from Germany-based Enjoy Solar.
“The base can also host other types of solar panels,” said Kilic.
The small wind turbine measures 1.8 m x 1.14 m x 1.14 m and weighs 70 kg. It has a ballast weight ranging from 70 kg to 100 kg and can operate with a temperature ranging from -25 C to 60 C. Every panel is made with glass fiber reinforced polyester, weighs 1.5 kg, and measures 1.5 m x 0.7 m x 1.5 mm. 
The wind power system also includes a 300 W axial flux PMS alternator (PMSA) that converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy
characterized as a three-phase alternating current. The hybrid system features a DualVolt Hybrid Inverter with an output of 500 W.
“It is engineered, developed, and manufactured by Airturb,” Kilic said.
The device measures 540 mm x 430 mm x 139 mm and weighs 25 kg. It must be placed separately on site, with a maximum distance to the system of 25 meters. Airturb offers the systems in two versions, with or without solar panels.
“Both models are pre–assembled by Airturb and delivered on-site by the installer,” Kilic said. “Currently, only the system including the base and solar panels are available. The system without the base and solar panels is being developed and we will offer it from the third quarter of this year.”
The complete package with the solar base and the DuoVolt wind inverter costs €4,235 ($4,626), not including installation costs, according to the company's website.
“The system is engineered, designed, and developed in The Netherlands, manufactured in Turkey and assembled in The Netherlands,” said Kilic.

Nova Innovation, a leading developer of tidal turbines, has added floating solar to its portfolio and will install the PV system later this year. The company is currently testing the array at its facilities in Edinburgh.
“These panels give a fascinating glimpse into the opportunities for Scotland’s future energy system and are the first step towards harnessing our significant potential for floating solar,” said Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf, during a tour of the manufacturing site in Edinburgh’s port district of Leith.
Nova Innovation installed the world’s first offshore tidal turbine array in Shetland in 2016 and subsequently received GBP 6.4 million ($8 million) from the Scottish National Investment Bank in 2021 to expand production of innovative renewable energy generators. It has since established project sites in Canada, France and Indonesia.
“The investment by the Scottish National Investment Bank in Nova Innovation helped expand its manufacturing base here in Leith and aligned strongly with the Scottish government’s priority of supporting innovative technology that will help us achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2045,” said Yousaf. “Scotland is already one of the most advanced hubs in Europe for the testing and demonstration of marine energy technology and I look forward to seeing where the panels will be launched in the near future.”
Nova Innovation CEO Simon Forrest said that record-high energy prices and growing concerns over security of supply made it imperative for Scotland to focus on homegrown energy from its  abundant natural resources.
The latest issue of pv magazine takes a look at how the long-established link between solar and cannabis cultivation can help improve margins as medicinal and recreational use of the drug comes out of the weeds. We take a trip Down Under to examine why communities are rebelling against planned renewable energy zones perceived as being railroaded through without sufficient local consultation, and we consider the “solar crime” wave sweeping the UK and Europe.
“Scotland is at the heart of the tidal energy revolution and Nova continues to lead the sector with proven technology and unrivalled reliability,” said Forrest. “With the addition of floating solar to our portfolio, we are ideally placed to help drive the race to net zero.”
Nova Innovation says the official launch of the floating PV installation will take place later this year. It claims that it already has a multi-megawatt international pipeline.
