https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/16/silfab-solar-launches-21-4-efficient-back-contact-residential-panel/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CANADA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 16, 2021",Silfab Solar launches 21.4%-efficient back contact residential panel,"Canada-based solar module manufacturer Silfab Solar has unveiled a new back contact module, which it claims is the most efficient and most durable panel ever produced by the company.
The SIL 370-380 BK series features three different modules with power ratings of 370, 375, and 380 W, and with module efficiencies ranging from 20.8 to 21.4%. The open-circuit voltage is between 44.76 and 45.13 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 10.33 to 10.55 A. The maximum system voltage for the module is 1,000 V.
All the modules measure 1,795 mm × 990 mm × 38 mm and weigh in at 19.0 kg. Each panel has 66 high-efficiency back-contact monocrystalline PERC cells, enclosed between 3.2 mm high transmittance, tempered glass, and a polymer backsheet developed by Dutch specialist DSM. It also features an MC4 connector developed by Swiss cable manufacturer Stäubli and a junction box with an IP 67 rating.
The panels can be used with operating temperatures of between -40°C and 85°C. The operating temperature coefficient is -0.37% per degree Celsius. They come with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 25-year product guarantee.
“The panel operates at lower temperatures in concert with superior low-light performance, which together increase energy yield by as much as 6% on a kWh/kWp basis,” the manufacturer stated. “The advanced back-contact technology reduces front cell metallization, minimizing shading losses, while simultaneously alleviating locked-in mechanical stress in the electrical contacts, resulting in improved performance, better long-term reliability, and higher efficiency.”
Silfab Solar currently produces back contact panels at its manufacturing facility in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and at a factory in Bellingham, Washington, in the United States.

The city council–part of the West Midlands Combined Authority comprised of seven city councils in the region–is set to approve, at a cabinet meeting in a week's time, the establishment of a joint venture (JV) with Coventry Airport Ltd to attempt to attract a battery supplier and/or automotive manufacturer to the site.
The council, in a press release issued today, said the small regional airport could accommodate up to 4.5 million square feet of commercial space and the JV would lodge a bid for planning permission this year which, if approved, could see battery manufacturing begin at the aerodrome by 2025.
The region hosts automotive manufacturers including Tata-owned Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin Lagonda, as well as taxi maker the London EV Company, which is owned by China's Geely.
Andy Street, the elected mayor of the West Midlands Combined Authority, quoted in the city council statement, said talks were already under way “with the UK’s leading car makers and battery suppliers across the globe.”
The proposed joint venture company would hope to secure a government grant of £500 million (€573 million) available for a U.K. gigafab, as part of an estimated £2 billion investment in such a production line.
Coventry City Council leader George Duggins pointed out Coventry hosts the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre and added: “Coventry Airport … is the obvious location for a U.K. gigafactory. It will immediately plug in to a mature automotive supply chain and skills ecosystem. The green industrial revolution is coming and I will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that Coventry is right at the heart of it. We have the site, the skills and the pedigree to make this work.”

The Africa Solar Outlook 2021 report, the first of a planned annual series by the membership organization, attempts to shine a light on the progress being made by the PV sector across an under-served continent but cannot help but highlight national government failings in its country-by-country analysis.
With numerous reports having extolled the benefits of setting national solar and renewable energy targets, the case of Cape Verde highlighted by AFSIA illustrates the importance of following through on such commitments, when it comes to attracting solar investment.
The island archipelago off the west coast of Africa had, until March, maintained an ambitious target of sourcing all of its electricity from renewables by last year, according to the AFSIA report–although the hyperlink to the policy statement provided in the report fails. That goal has reportedly been scaled back to a much less ambitious 30% by 2025 and 50% by 2030.
Whether the revised target can be met, in a nation which has only 8.8 MW of installed solar capacity–according to AFSIA and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)–remains to be seen. The same can be said for Djibouti, a solar-free nation which in 2019 said it would have an entirely renewable energy system by last year, and of the eight other African nations which boasted clean energy ambitions ranging from 5-50% by last year.
Kenya was forced to admit defeat on plans for a fully renewable power mix by last year, and pushed the target back a decade and Niger‘s plan for 100 MW of solar “by 2021” could at least be said to be theoretically achievable, given a generous interpretation of the word “by”. Niger currently has 7 MW of solar, according to the AFSIA study, albeit with plans for a further 150 MW by the 14 governments which comprise the West African Power Pool.
Similar policy confusion apparently haunts Algeria, one of the countries tipped in the report to be likely to join South Africa and Egypt in solar's ‘gigawatt club' of nations. pv magazine has reported on previously-trailed plans by the Algerian authorities to develop the 4 GW Tafouk 1 solar field, via five 800 MW procurement rounds up to 2024. However, the AFSIA study cited a report by African clean power news site Afrik21 in August, which referred to comments made by Algerian minister of energy transition and renewable energies, Chems-Eddine Chitour, which apparently cast doubt on the project.
Chitour reportedly said, in an interview with “national radio”: “Frankly, I don't know anything about the 4,000 megawatts and I don't like the effects of the announcement.” With the minister appointed in June, as part of the cabinet chosen by president Abdelmadjid Tebboune, who took office in January 2020, the nation's solar ambition now appears to have been scaled back to two 500 MW tenders to be comprised of 50 MW, 100 MW and 150 MW sections of generation capacity.
There are, however, reasons for optimism in the AFSIA report, which tips Morocco, with its 2 GW solar pipeline; and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which has reportedly signed contracts for 1 GW of photovoltaics, to follow in the footsteps of solar pioneers Egypt–with its 1.76 GW-plus of capacity–and South Africa, which boasts around 2.9 GW and has plans in place to procure 6.8 GW more.
Mention is made of the heady plans by southern neighbors Namibia and Botswana to install 4.5 GW of PV and concentrating solar power (CSP) capacity, starting with 275 MW of photovoltaics and 500 MW of CSP. The DRC plans 1 GW of solar for Kinshasha city, and three remote cities elsewhere in the huge nation will benefit from ‘mini' grids which could prove to be the world's largest, after the award of a contract to a consortium comprised of French power company Eranove, Madrid-based developer AEE Power and U.K. government-backed electricity network company Gridworks.
While policy support appears patchy on a continental scale, the AFSIA study highlights exemplars in the island nations of Mauritius and the Seychelles. The former offers solar tax incentives, net metering for small residential systems, feed-in tariff (FIT) payments for registered household solar owners and free installation of small PV systems for 2,000 small and medium-sized businesses. Net metering, solar rebates and household PV loans are available in the Seychelles, where the authorities exempt all solar components from goods and services tax.
However, policy is not always enough, with the report noting in Mozambique there has been a “FIT available since 2014 but no success thus far.”
Elsewhere, in Sudan–where the UAE government is financing 500 MW of large scale solar capacity–the electricity price rose 500% at the start of the year, again illustrating the choppy waters investors often have to navigate in Africa.
With hurdles such as those, turning ambition into reality can be a tough business in nations such as Ethiopia, which has plans for 1.33 GW of solar under the World Bank's Scaling Solar program but, according to AFSIA and IRENA, has thus far installed only 500 kW of mini-grid and solar home system generation capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/16/first-attempt-to-fabricate-solar-cells-based-on-antimony-selenoiodide/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 16, 2021",First attempt to fabricate solar cells based on antimony selenoiodide,"Researchers at South Korea’s Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) have tried to build a solar cell based on antimony selenoiodide (SbSeI).
SbSeI is a ferroelectric photoconductor compound that has promising optical properties. It has been applied with success in various optoelectronic applications, but has not been considered for PV applications thus far.
The scientists built the solar cell by depositing the compound onto mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO2) through multiple spin-coating cycles.
“The effects of deposition cycles including the spin-coating and thermal decomposition of SbSeI on the device performance were investigated by measuring the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and temperature‐dependent current-voltage curves,” the researchers said.
They added that the hole transport layer (HTL) and the electron transport layer (ETL) were both fabricated with PCPDTBT, which is a low bandgap polymer that is used as a donor material, with high photovoltaic efficiency. They claim that the resulting cell has a 4.10% power conversion efficiency, with good stability under standard testing conditions.
“The performance exhibits a short-circuit current density of 14.8 mA cm2, an open-circuit voltage of 473.0 mV, and a fill factor of 58.7%,” the scientists explained, noting that the device can retain around 90.% of its initial efficiency, even after 2,321 minutes under standard illumination. “These results show that the SbSeI solar cells exhibited good stabilities, regardless of humidity, temperature, and light.”
The cell's efficiency is still too low due to insufficient absorption and inefficient charge transfer, the scientists said.
“The inefficient charge transfer in the cells fabricated through 12 cycles was due to deeper level trap states,” they stated. “Sufficient absorption and efficient charge transfer were achieved in the cells fabricated through 10 cycles, and the champion cell exhibited a power conversion efficient of 4.10%.”
They will now use their findings to investigate the potential of metal chalcohalides for solar cells and intermediate products to synthesize lead-free perovskite materials. They described the solar cell in “Efficient and Stable Antimony Selenoiodide Solar Cells,” which was recently published in Advanced Science.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/16/quantum-dot-solar-cells-and-the-search-for-stability/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE,GERMANY,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"FEBRUARY 16, 2021",Quantum dot solar cells and the search for stability,"Almost exactly one year ago, scientists at Australia’s University of Queensland demonstrated a quantum dot solar cell at 16.6% efficiency, an achievement that the director of the university’s nanomaterials center called “effectively the difference between quantum dot solar cell technology being an exciting ‘prospect’ and being commercially viable.”
This efficiency achievement, and the opening of realistic pathways to push beyond 20%, has led scientists to begin thinking about how this technology might look outside of a laboratory setting. Research into quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs) has expanded its focus to take in the many other factors that would affect the material’s performance in a commercial setting. Most QDSC materials that scientists work with could lend themselves quite easily to low-cost, high-volume production techniques. And the ability to easily tune materials to different bandgaps offers further opportunities in device design. Long-term stability, however, still poses challenges.
Quantum dot materials often oxidize and lose performance when exposed to ambient air, and are also variously sensitive to raised temperatures, moisture and other conditions they would be sure to face installed in an outdoor setting. Unwanted reactions with other cell layers and materials can also pose a problem for QDSC device designers.
A new paper from scientists at TU Dresden in Germany; Stability of Quantum Dot Solar Cells: A Matter of (Life)Time, published in Advanced Energy Materials, examines the stability issues and degradation mechanisms holding back three common classes of QD material.
The paper outlines degradation effects observed in earlier experiments for quantum dot materials based on lead chalcogenides and lead-halide perovskites, as well as lead-free quantum dots. For each material, they outline the major known stability issues, as well as the recent progress and potential solutions to them.
While each of the materials has its own intricacies, the group was able to draw broad conclusions about the stability issues affecting QDSCs. “All three share plenty commonalities in their fundamental causes for degradation. Ambient factors such as oxygen and water, but also increased temperatures or high intensities of illumination can decrease the lifetime of QDSCs,” they explain. “Beyond these external factors, both the intrinsic properties of QDs and their interplay with other materials present in the photovoltaic devices can also serve as causes of degradation.”
The group’s key finding is that stability testing in QDSC’s has so far seen piecemeal development, with focus on different factors. “Unfortunately, the lack of a standardized method to assess stability of QDSCs limits the applicability of the results across the field,” the group explains. “To address this issue, we propose two simple stability tests (stress‐free and realistic) which we believe can increase the comparability, reliability, and reproducibility of results and encourage the scientific community to adopt them.”
Looking to the development of such standards in perovskite solar cells, which are somewhat further along the path to commercialization, the group encourages other QDSC researchers to adopt two standard sets of testing protocols: “stress-free” – where the device’s best efficiency is measured with an encapsulant, under an inert atmosphere at room temperature, and at open circuit bias with illumination only for the length of time needed for a current-voltage sweep.
A second set of tests is then recommended to evaluate the device under more “realistic” conditions. This would expose devices without encapsulant to a controlled humidity environment and temperatures up to 85 degrees Celsius, at maximum power point under continuous ‘one sun’ illumination.
“We hope future research focuses on a more profound analysis of the degradation mechanisms in QDSCs….,” the scientists conclude. “Such a detailed investigation—in combination with accurate characterization of the J–V characteristics evolution—would inevitably enhance the understanding of degradation mechanisms of QDSCs, and expedite the development of mitigation strategies.”

“The asset is the largest merchant portfolio of plants in Italy, without GSE incentives, of which [the solar projects] nine are located in Lazio and eight in Sardinia,” the company said, without providing more details on the 17 solar plants.
The portfolio includes a 40 MW solar plant in Assemini, near Cagliari, on Italy’s largest island, Sardinia, and 66 MW of operational plants in Montalto di Castro, central Italy. These solar plants also selling power through PPAs to Switzerland-based off-taker DXT commodities.
Through this transaction, which must still be approved by the Italian authorities, the PV plant portfolio owned by A2A will grow to 284 MW. In March 2018, it acquired five operational PV plants with a combined power of 15.7 MW in Italy from U.K.-based Impax Asset Management Group plc.
In October 2017, A2A took over 17.8 MW of Italian solar plants, all of which are located in the Marche region, central Italy, from local renewable energy developer Novapower, a unit of local industrial group Merloni Holding. Earlier, in September, A2A also acquired another 17 MW of PV plants from local fund Fondo Re Energy Capital.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/16/belgiums-flanders-region-unveils-compensation-scheme-for-pv-systems-affected-by-smart-meter-disruption/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,BELGIUM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 16, 2021",Belgium’s Flanders region unveils compensation scheme for PV systems affected by smart meter disruption,"The energy minister of the Belgian macro-region of Flanders, Zuhal Demir, has announced a package of measures that is intended at mitigating the effect of a recent ruling of Belgium's Constitutional Court, which established that the owners of PV systems with a capacity of up to 10 kW which have not installed a digital smart meter cannot keep operating under net metering. Under the previous regulatory framework, residential PV system owners were granted a 15-year grace period during which they could continue to operate under net metering with a smart digital meter, just like if they still had a standard meter.
The draft regulation, which has now been sent to the country's Council of State for review, would introduce compensation–which the Flemish government called a “retroactive investment premium”–and would apply to PV systems that were grid connected by the end of 2020. “This will be based on the calculated support required to obtain a reasonable investment return of 5%,” Demir specified.
If the new regulation does not come into force, everyone with a digital meter and PV will lose net metering billing.
“The compensation is given to prosumers who already had their digital meter (DM) installed or who will get one in the coming months and years,” the managing director at Flemish renewable energy association Organisatie voor Duurzame Energie Vlaanderen, Dirk Van Evercooren, told pv magazine. “The plan was to roll out the DM[s] to prosumers as a priority target group and this is now canceled and reversed.”
According to the new regulation, the roll-out should take place more organically, with less–or zero–focus on priority groups. “Moreover, prosumers have the right to ask to postpone the installation of the smart meter until 2025,” Van Evercooren added. “This allows them to profit from the net metering through the analog meter or some more time, therefore reducing the need for compensation for the loss of return on investment due to the end of net metering.”
 The compensation would be calculated by looking at the year of grid connection, the year in which the digital meter was installed, the peak power of installation, the length of time that a system had benefited from net metering, the government support already enjoyed, and the prosumer tariff paid in the past. “It is said that, for an average PV system installed in 2020 with a digital meter, the premium would amount to €1,308,” Van Evercooren specified.
He also explained that the Flemish renewable energy sector is not against the deployment of smart meters. “The idea is that the digital meter will only become smart if it is used actively and therefore it needs to be welcomed by the prosumer,” Van Evercooren affirmed. According to him, there is currently no widespread support among prosumers and the five-year delay granted by the government would enable a demonstration of the positive aspects of the digital meters for prosumers. “We aim to convince everyone to join the energy transition and use the smart meters,” he concluded.
The smart meter issue is affecting the vast majority of PV system owners in Flanders. Most of the region's PV capacity, in fact, is represented by solar installations not exceeding 10 kW in size, that operate under the net metering regime. After the ruling of the Constitutional Court, many owners of PV systems united to begin legal actions against the new net metering conditions. A dedicated group on Facebook has seen the number of members increase to more than 50,000 in a few days.

The Austrian energy agency, OeMAG, has allocated 322 MW of PV capacity across 15,957 rooftop solar projects under the country's residential solar subsidy program.
According to the Austrian authorities, the funding pot has triggered around €332.4 million in investments.
Homeowners who install systems with capacities of up to 5 kW can qualify for a rebate of €250 per grid-connected kilowatt installed, or €350 per kilowatt of off-grid capacity. For storage systems, the rebate available per kilowatt-hour of usable capacity ranges from €350 for the smallest units–with a capacity up to 5 kWh–to €250 for the largest (20 kWh and above).

The PV glass shortage that persisted through the last quarter of 2020 set module prices surging, forcing developers to slow inventory draw. Module manufacturers were forced to renegotiate contracts signed at lower prices or postpone delivery until this year due to glass price hikes.
As 2021 gets going, much of the world is still struggling to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. Though concerns over the crisis are again rising among PV manufacturers, global PV demand is expected to shine brighter in the post-pandemic world. PV InfoLink expects global module demand to reach 153.8 GW this year, growing by 10% from 2020.
The strong growth can be ascribed to projects deferred by the pandemic or by price increases. Other contributing factors are stronger demand expected in traditional PV markets across the globe. China, the United States, Europe, and India will dominate more than 70% of the market. This year will mark the beginning of China’s 14th Five-Year Plan, under which unsubsidized projects will become the major market driver. Relaxed regulations on the PV-to-inverter ratio will result in 52 GW of module demand in China.
Driven by postponed commercial/distributed-generation projects, U.S. PV demand is likely to grow slowly, and with President Joe Biden having taken office and the solar ITC having been extended, the long-term outlook for the U.S. market is optimistic, with demand likely to reach 24 GW this year. While the resurgence of Covid-19 continues to rage across Europe, strong PV demand on the continent looks set to continue this year, thanks to continued support from governments. Europe is forecast to see 27 GW of demand.
India is expected to recover from the pandemic crisis, as well as conflicts with China and price increases. With auctions for utility-scale PV underway, PV InfoLink calculates 9 GW of demand for the country. Emerging markets including the Middle East and Latin America are worth noting. The United Arab Emirates, where utility-scale projects in Dubai are likely to be commissioned this year, will see demand growth. Driven by IPP and unsubsidized projects, demand will continue to grow in Brazil and Chile. In contrast, the Vietnamese market will slow down with a lack of incentives, after experiencing a demand boom last year.
Since manufacturers were stocking up on materials ahead of the Lunar New Year in February, material prices held ground in January. Consequently, module prices also stayed higher at the start of the year. While new PV glass capacity will come online after the Lunar New Year, easing the shortage, module manufacturers will not lower prices after higher costs cut into their profits. As a result, module prices will remain high through February.
Demand will grow in the second quarter, when the Chinese market begins the June 30 installation rush and other markets are connecting deferred projects to the grid. However, as the U.S. dollar has been slipping against the Yuan and ocean freight rates have been rising since the end of 2020, the volume of new orders is low. Moreover, cell prices began to slide in January. Against this backdrop, module prices are expected to return to the downward trend between March and April.
China will officially enter the grid parity era after the mid-year installation rush. The traditional high season will return to Europe and the United States, while India will rebound after the fiscal year begins. Overall, the second half of this year will see stronger demand than the first.
Meanwhile, capacity ramps will continue. The 10 largest module manufacturers will bring more than 50 GW quarterly capacity online during the third and fourth quarters – far exceeding estimated demand of 40 GW for the period. Coupled with growing glass capacity and cell price decreases, module prices will be driven down at a faster pace in the second half. PV InfoLink predicts that mono PERC modules rated at 355-365 W to 425-435 W will fall to $ 0.19-0.195/W.

The virus continues to rage, but impacts on solar and renewables are diminishing gradually, as countries reopen their economies and roll out vaccines. Projects will develop more smoothly this year with relatively relaxed measures, and those postponed from last year will start installing. This points to optimistic market prospects for the year.
Driven by postponed projects, as well as China’s June 30 installation rush, strong demand is likely to persist from the second half of 2020 to the first half of this year. Meanwhile, prices for modules and their components have remained high due to strong demand ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. But these will begin to decline rapidly in the second quarter, when new glass capacity comes online, cell prices slip, and overseas customers are in “wait-and-see” mode.
The second half will see strong demand as the traditional high season returns to Europe and the United States, while demand from unsubsidized projects in China emerges. In the meantime, new module production lines will be commissioned in the second half and the surplus will drive down module prices. The PV market will recover from the pandemic in 2021. As the world moves toward carbon neutrality and grid parity, solar PV will remain a major driving force behind renewables targets.

Longroad Energy Holdings has announced plans to acquire the Sun Streams 2, 4, and 5 solar projects in Arizona from First Solar.
The deal includes the 200 MW Sun Streams 2 solar plant, which is under construction and set to go into service in June. The other two projects, which represent a combined 700 MW of capacity, have yet to break ground. They could be developed to include up to 2 GWh of energy storage capacity.
First Solar will provide its Series 6 modules for the facilities. Around 700 MW represent new bookings for the manufacturer.
McCarthy Building is constructing Sun Streams 2. Its energy production will be sold under a long-term contract with an unnamed buyer.
Sun Streams 4 and 5 have target in-service dates of 2022 and 2024, respectively. Sun Streams 4 will have a capacity of 200 MW, while Sun Streams 5 will have 500 MW of capacity.
The Sun Streams complex offers access to the California Independent System Operator grid, as well as southwestern U.S. markets. It is located west of Phoenix and close to the Palo Verde nuclear power plant, which is the largest nuclear generating station in the United States.
In January, First Solar said it would sell a 10 GW utility-scale solar project platform to Leeward Renewable Energy Development. The $261 million transaction is expected to close in the first quarter. Leeward Renewable Energy Development is a portfolio company of OMERS Infrastructure, which is an investment unit of OMERS, one of Canada’s largest benefit pension plans.

Wholesale electricity prices are trending lower in the first month of 2021 across all states in Australia, according to research from Cornwall Insight, which notes that this builds on the low-price outcomes seen in December 2020. Solar and wind have been accounting for more of the electricity mix, pushing down the contributions of fossil fuels, as well as wholesale prices.
“It is, in fact, the lowest monthly average price since December 2012. Unsurprisingly, this price drop had a large impact on more expensive natural gas generation in Victoria,” said Cornwall Insight Australia Consultant George Wong.
“The largest decrease in natural gas generation percentage can be seen in Victoria, where it only accounted for 0.7% of the total generation in January 2021. In Victoria, the brown coal generation also saw a decrease in percentage share from 78.8% to 74.9%. In contrast, solar PV generation has increased from 1.5% to 2.9%, while wind generation increased from 11.2% to 16.3%.” 
Wong said it's the “same story” with other Australian states.
“With a low average monthly price driven by increased solar PV and wind generation. The consequence of which is a reduction in the share of fossil fuels in the generation mix,” he said. “As the wholesale electricity price has fallen, out-of-market costs to keep the system secure have also increased, with South Australia particularly seeing a 91% increase in out-of-market costs when comparing 2020 with 2019.”
