In the same period of 2021, the company sold 21,471 MT and revenue totaled $256.1 million. Net profit increased considerably from $83.2 million in the first quarter of 2021 to $535.8 million in the latest quarter. “We are very pleased to report exceptional results for the first quarter of 2022, the best-ever in the company’s history,” said Daqo CEO Longgen Zhang. “Last December, we began production at our new 35,000 MT phase 4B polysilicon expansion project. Production ramp up was successful throughout the first quarter.” Looking forward, Daqo said it expected to produce between 32,000 MT to 34,000 MT of polysilicon in the second quarter of 2022 and approximately 120,000 MT to 125,000 MT of polysilicon in the full year of 2022. “We believe the polysilicon sector will remain one of the most profitable sectors in the solar PV value chain, as polysilicon will continue to be in short supply and determine the actual pace and total volume of global installations,” the company stated.
Inverter manufacturer Sungrow released its annual financial report on Tuesday, which states the company suffered a significant drop in profits despite increased sales. The company achieved revenue of CNY 24 billion ($3.77 billion), with a YoY increase of 25.15%. Net profit, meanwhile, dropped 19% YoY to CNY 1.58 billion. Sungrow said shipments of its major inverter products reached 47 GW, which it claims accounted for a market share of over 30% globally. Within the total, 18 GW was for the Chinese domestic market and 29 GW for external markets. In an online Q&A with investors and shareholders, Sungrow provided three reasons for the profit decline in 2021. The first was the PV plant business in Vietnam, which suffered delays to due to COVID-19 in 2021. The second was the cancellation of a solar project in Myanmar due to the military coup. And the last was the delay of energy storage projects in overseas markets due to the COVID crisis.
Polysilicon manufacturer GCL-Poly announced on Tuesday that it changed its name to GCL Technology Holdings Limited, effective April 1, 2022. The new Cayman Islands-based company will continue to be listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The company also announced a strategic cooperation with Zhonghuan Semiconductor for a new polysilicon manufacturing facility in Inner Mongolia. The new facility will be located in Hohhot and will have an annual capacity of 100,000 metric tons of annual capacity, The planned investment is around CNY 9 billion ($1.4 billion). GCL Technology will take a 60% share of the joint venture and TCL together with Zhonghuan will take another 40% share.
Hong Kong-based IDG Energy Investment Ltd on Tuesday revealed more details of its move into “advanced solar manufacturing” as it announced that the first customer for its single wafer wet processing equipment would receive the production equipment in the final quarters of this year and next year. They will be manufactured at a fab dedicated to solar cell and semiconductor single wafer clean equipment production lines in Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, which IDG said would be open by July. An update to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange stated: “The products which the company currently contemplates include various types of equipment which can clean wafers with sizes of 6 inches, 8 inches, and 12 inches. The application of the products covers wafer back side thinning, back side clean[ing], bulk chemical[s], solvent clean[ing], and combo configurations.”
Module manufacturer Solargiga on Tuesday published unaudited first-quarter figures indicating a  revenue increase of 5.7% on the same period of last year, from CNY 1.05 billion ($164 million) to CNY 1.1 billion. The volume of shipments to external customers, however, fell on the same measure, from 1.49 GW worth of solar ingots, wafers, and modules in the January-to-March period last year, to 1.33 GW this year.
Of the total CNY 8.71 billion ($1.34 billion) in revenue generated by glass manufacturer Flat Glass last year, CNY 7.12 billion came from the company’s solar panel glass operation, according to the company's 2021 annual report published on Monday. That PV glass revenue figure marked a rise of 36% from the CNY 5.23 billion recorded in 2020. The solar panel unit banked a gross profit of CNY 2.54 billion, even as the PV glass gross profit margin decreased from 44.91% in 2020 to 35.7% as prices fell from the second quarter of last year onwards and freight and raw material costs rose. Flat Glass posted a net profit of CNY 2.12 billion in 2021 and is continuing to expand its production capacity with two phases of a production line project under way in Anhui and plans for four PV glass furnaces in Nantong, in Jiangsu Province, which will have a total daily melting capacity of 1,200 metric tons. The company said it restarted a 600-ton furnace in Jiaxing, Jiangsu, in the first quarter of this year, following cold repairs.
Solar developer and investor C Smarter Energy on Monday said it had received notice from the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong that trading in its stock cannot be resumed until the winding up petition issued against the company by investor Nine United is withdrawn or dismissed. Trading in the shares has been suspended since April 1 last year and Nine United lodged its petition in December in relation to $4.52 million and HKD 5.51 million ($702,000) it claims it is owed.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/22/the-mobility-revolution-hybrid-lithium-ion-battery-capable-of-recharging-within-a-minute/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,MINIGRID,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"APRIL 22, 2022",The mobility rEVolution: Hybrid lithium-ion battery capable of recharging within a minute,"A research team at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) has developed a high-energy density, ultrafast rechargeable hybrid lithium-ion battery that can be used in smart electronic devices and EVs. “The hybrid lithium-ion battery, which has a high energy density (285 Wh/kg) and can be rapidly charged with a high-power density (22,600 W/kg), is overcoming the limitations of the current energy storage system,” Professor Jung-Goo Kang of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering said. “It will be a breakthrough.” The research team synthesized a porous carbon hollow structure with a large surface area by changing the orientation of the polymer resin from linear to twisted. When the twisted resin was carbonized, more micropores were formed, and a carbon structure with a surface area 12 times larger than that of the conventional linear resin was created. The carbon structure created through this process was used as a capacitor-type cathode material. In addition, the anode was made using a germanium-embedded hollow carbon nanosphere material to reduce degradation and maximize the dispersion of lithium ions. The researchers found that the hybrid lithium-ion battery using those special electrodes had an energy density comparable to that of conventional lithium-ion batteries and the power density characteristics of a capacitor, affording recharge within a minute.
In the meantime, an extreme fast charging battery tech developed by Israeli start-up StoreDot got one step closer to commercial viability with an investment from Volvo Cars Tech Fund, the Swedish carmaker's venture capital arm. With the amount of the strategic investment undisclosed, Volvo Cars has become the latest major automotive manufacturer and a vote of confidence in StoreDot's advanced technologies, following the likes of Daimler, BP Ventures, Ola Electric, Samsung, TDK, EVE and VinFast. According to the Geely-owned Swedish company, the investment gives it “the opportunity to collaborate closely with StoreDot on exciting new battery technology, as it aims to become a pure electric car company by 2030”. The first established car maker to commit to all-out electrification, the company is aiming for half of its global volume to consist of pure electric cars, Volvo is aiming for half of its global volume to consist of pure electric cars by 2025. As previously announced, the Israeli start-up is on track to begin mass producing its ‘100in5' silicon-dominant anode extreme fast charging (XFC) lithium-ion cells as early as 2024, achieving 100 miles of charge in just five minutes. For StoreDot, the financial shot into the arm as part of StoreDot's Series D investment round means that it will be able to bring its batteries to the market quicker and boost ongoing R&D into solid-state technologies. According to its strategic technology roadmap unveiled last month, StoreDot gears to deliver three generations of its battery technology – described as 100in5, 100in3, and 100in2 of miles per minute of charging – by 2024, 2028 and 2030. StoreDot claims that it is already at the “advanced stages of developing ground-breaking semi-solid-state technologies” which it believes will further improve its batteries by 40% over the next four years. Its third-generation achievement is expected to come on the back of a post-lithium technology that is to offer an energy density of more than 550 Wh/kg.
With slow charging times one of the major deterrents to EV adoption, Korea-based Hyundai is partnering with retail giant Lotte Group and KB Asset Management to accelerate the establishment of a super-fast charging infrastructure in Korea. Their plan is to set up a special purpose company through which they will lease EV superfast chargers of up to 200 kW to local charging companies. Their goal is to enable 5,000 units in major cities across the country by 2025. With its E-pit, a high-speed EV charging brand, Hyundai is leading the development of the domestic EV charging infrastructure ecosystem. In this week’s statement, the Korean carmaker reported it is now operating E-pit charging stations at twelve highway locations and six urban hubs. Through the new partnership, the company wants to add “major downtown business sites,” such as their national sales and service centers and offices, to its high-speed EV charging network. Lotte Group will also provide its retail facilities such as department stores and shopping malls in major cities as locations to install the new EV chargers.
According to the report Powering Small-Format Electric Vehicles with Minigrids, scaling electric mobility to a growing solar minigrid industry in Nigeria may be transformative for people living without access to transportation, and profitable for both minigrid and EV operators. The report by RMI, Factor[e] Ventures and the UK-charity Shell Foundation finds that in rural communities where solar minigrids are a better option than extending the grid, integrating EVs may stack the benefits of clean, affordable transport on top of those from reliable electricity access. The study also shows that renewable energy minigrids in rural Nigeria can power two- and three-wheeled EVs for the same cost as fossil-fueled alternatives. Finally, the study showed that at the costs, rental revenues and vehicle utilization observed in the Nigeria pilot, investments in leased electric two-wheelers are expected to pay back within a 10-year vehicle life.
For the world’s leading EV manufacturer, Tesla, the first quarter of the year was yet another opportunity to post record profits despite supply chain issues exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the production stop at its Shanghai Gigafactory. It generated a total of $18.76 billion in sales, of which $16.86 billion came from the automotive division. By comparison, in Q1 2021 revenue stood at $10.39 billion, and in the final quarter of 2021, it grew to $17.72 billion. From January to March, Tesla delivered record-breaking 310,048 electric cars worldwide. Due to the production halt of six days in Shanghai, corresponding to some 12,000 cars that could have been built during that time, production in Q1 fell to 305,407 vehicles. While it is looking to ramp up production in all gigafactories, Tesla says it is making “significant efforts” to advance its own cell manufacturing, raw material sourcing and supplier diversification.
Other industry players have felt the pinch to a greater degree. French carmaker Renault reported lower first-quarter revenues due to the war in Ukraine and a semiconductor shortage, which was partially offset by higher prices and rising EV sales. Renault’s revenue fell by 2.7% from a year earlier to 9.748 billion euros ($10.6 billion), and sales were down by more than 17% versus the first quarter of 2021 to 552,000 vehicles, the lowest quarterly sales since the global financial crisis in 2009. The bright spot in its Q1 report are sales of fully electric and hybrid vehicles that were up 13% and accounted for 36% of total sales.
In the Netherlands, solar car start-up Lightyear is partnering with The Sharing Group to integrate its vehicles into their car-sharing platform MyWheels. Under the deal, the solar car maker will supply 5,000 Lightyear Two vehicles to the platform by 2025. In addition, Lightyear One will also be offered via MyWheels as early as 2023, but it has not been specified how many of these vehicles will be available on the platform. Lightyear One is the company's first model that will only be produced in a limited quantity. It will go into production next summer, and first customer deliveries will begin by the end of the year. Lightyear Two will be the mass-market model of the technology manufacturer and will go to market in 2024/2025 with a starting price of €30,000. According to Lightyear CEO Lex Hoefsloot, the future of mobility is not only about the vehicle itself, but also about how we use it. “Car sharing services are an example of how the market is evolving to find new, more sustainable ways to keep people mobile without owning a car,” Hoefsloot says. The company said that vehicles like the Lightyear One and Two generate power themselves and have less moving parts than other cars so their maintenance and operation costs will be comparatively low.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/22/the-hydrogen-stream-magnetic-alloys-for-efficient-hydrogen-cooling/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,EGYPT,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"APRIL 22, 2022",The Hydrogen Stream: Magnetic alloys for efficient hydrogen cooling,"National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), Tohoku University and Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JASRI) have developed a series of Er(Ho)Co2-based magnetic cooling alloys that can be used to efficiently cool hydrogen from 77 K to 20 K. This temperature range, according to the scientists, represents a wide operating temperature window due to the stacking of the refrigerants covering the range of application temperatures for hydrogen liquefaction, easy fabrication, and stable magnetocaloric properties of gas-atomized particles. Prior to this research, Er(Ho)Co2-based magnetic compounds' cooling capability was previously not reversible due to their poor cyclic performance. “These problems are overcome in this work. This research group discovered that by adding trace amounts of 3d transition metal elements make the compounds resistant to deterioration caused by repeated magnetic field application and temperature fluctuation,” NIMS wrote on Thursday. Their findings were presented in a study published in nature communications.
Scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory (INL) used a “simple” acid treatment to bond the electrode to the electrolyte more tightly within protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs). “The increased surface area caused a tighter bond between electrode and electrolyte that allowed for a more efficient flow of hydrogen atoms. Additionally, the cell stability improved significantly, especially under certain extreme conditions,” Idaho National Laboratory wrote. The team, which published the results in the scientific journal nature, included researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New Mexico State University, and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
The Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology ILT in Germany will officially open its laboratory for interdisciplinary collaboration on hydrogen in May. The aim is to advance fuel cells' cost-optimized and demand-oriented series production. “Researchers at Fraunhofer ILT are working on laser processes for the production of bipolar plates used in fuel cells. By selectively structuring and coating bipolar plates, research can significantly improve their efficiency and functionality,” Fraunhofer Institute wrote earlier this month. The facilities will also work on structuring with ultrashort pulse lasers for laser-based coating and high-speed welding and cutting.
H2FLY, a German developer of hydrogen fuel cell technologies for aircraft, announced that its demonstrator four-seat plane, the HY4, is the first hydrogen-electric passenger aircraft to be piloted between two major airports. “We are also thrilled to have set what we believe to be a new world record by reaching an altitude of over 7,000 feet with our HY4 aircraft,” Josef Kallo, co-founder and CEO of H2FLY, commented. The aircraft flew from Stuttgart to Friedrichshafen to participate in the AERO Friedrichshafen airshow, taking place from April 27. “It also serves as a test platform to further develop the propulsion system and thus lay the foundation for development work on a hydrogen-electric-powered, 40-seat Dornier 328, which will be developed jointly with Deutsche Aircraft by 2025,” the company wrote on Tuesday. 
Vessel owner Switch Maritime told Reuters that the 75-passenger ferry service in the San Francisco Bay would begin operations in June. The manufacturer, All American Marine, unveiled the project in December 2021. The vessel has a hydrogen fuel cell power package provided by Zero Emissions Industries, comprised of 360 kW of Cummins fuel cells and Hexagon hydrogen storage tanks with a capacity of 246 kg. Several deals to promote hydrogen-fuelled vessels have been signed over the last months, mostly in the US and Northern Europe. A team led by Seattle City Light, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), and Sandia National Laboratories announced in November 2021 two studies exploring the potential of shifting from fossil fuel to clean hydrogen as fuel to power medium and heavy-duty vehicles. Norway is also active in the sector. In January 2022, Torghatten Nord signed a contract with the Norwegian Public Roads Administration to operate hydrogen ferries between Bodø and Lofoten from 2025. In June 2021, the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment's Enova funding agency announced its support for liquid organic hydrogen applications company Hydrogenious LOHC Maritime.
AMEA Power, an Emirati renewable project developer, and Egyptian authorities signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to produce 390,000 tonnes of green ammonia per annum over two phases in Ain Sokhna, Egypt. “Renewable energy will be used to power large-scale electrolyzers to produce green hydrogen, without generating carbon emissions,” the Emirati company wrote on Thursday. This is AMEA Power's first green hydrogen project. “This green hydrogen will then be used as feed-stock at an adjacent ammonia synthesis facility, also powered by renewables, for the production and export of green ammonia via the Ain Sokhna port.” AMEA Power is reportedly discussing green hydrogen and ammonia projects across the Middle East and Africa. Egypt is discussing hydrogen collaboration with the European Commission. It intends to become a hub for green molecules. Last month, the General Authority for Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE), the Sovereign Fund of Egypt (TSFE), the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC), and the New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) also signed an MoU with Norway's Scatec to jointly develop a green ammonia facility with a production capacity of 1 million tonnes annually. Also in March, British provider of oilfield services Petrofac announced it had secured its first new energy project in the country with a subsidiary of Egypt-focused Mediterranean Energy Partners (MEP).
Portuguese project developer Madoqua Renewables teamed up with Dutch project developer and consultancy Power2X and Danish fund manager Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) to build MadoquaPower2X, a €1 billion industrial-scale project for the production of green hydrogen and ammonia in Sines, Portugal. “MadoquaPower2X will use renewable energy and 500 MW of electrolysis capacity. It is the first project to be installed at the future energy and technological hub of Sines, with an industrial scale production of 50,000 tons of green hydrogen and 500,000 tons of green ammonia per year,” wrote the companies. The hydrogen will target local usage and export markets. The project, which would contribute nearly 25% of Portugal's envisaged 2 GW electrolyzer capacity by 2030, is reportedly expected to be ready for a final investment decision by the end of 2023. “Additionally, if preferred over ammonia production, MadoquaPower2X could meet 100% of Portugal's gas grid hydrogen injection targets.” In March, CIP invested in Dresden-based electrolyzer manufacturer Sunfire, an alkali and solid oxide technologies (SOEC) specialist. In February, CIP teamed up with three Spanish companies, Enagás, Naturgy and Fertiberia, and Danish wind turbine manufacturer Vestas to develop the first phase of Project Catalina on the Spanish Eastern coast. 
Australia's Labor and Liberal parties are supporting a AUD 140 million ($102 million) funding commitment equally split between Pilbara and Kwinana, two new hydrogen centers in Western Australia. “This AUD 140 million commitment will supercharge our renewable hydrogen industry, helping to stimulate local demand for hydrogen to get production projects get off the ground,” commented Western Australia's Hydrogen Industry Minister Alannah MacTiernan. The Federal government chose not to support funding for a third project in Oakajee, however. The Kwinana project, developed by Macquarie Group and bp, will include an electrolyzer of at least 75 MW, hydrogen storage, compression and truck loading facilities. “Bp will soon release the outcomes of a feasibility study into the production of green hydrogen at the site,” the oil and gas major wrote on Tuesday.
MacTiernan released Wednesday the feasibility study on the conversion of the Henderson Waste Recovery Park in Western Australia into a renewable energy park. “The study successfully delivered a design for a green hydrogen facility, which also makes use of existing landfill gas power to enable round-the-clock off-grid hydrogen production,” the WA government wrote. The hydrogen would be used to refuel the City of Cockburn's refuse collection vehicles, including the option to re-use leachate water. Meanwhile, also on Wednesday, the Queensland government announced that local bus company Emerald Coaches would add two hydrogen fuel cell electric buses into its fleet of 120 diesel buses by mid-2023.
Australian automotive company H2X has signed a memorandum of understanding with the municipality of Trelleborg to develop the city's first-ever hydrogen high floor buses and a waste truck through local energy company Trelleborg Energi. “With the first fueling station up and running in Trelleborg in January 2023, these initiatives are an amazing start in transforming the vehicle sector in this region,” commented Magnus Sahlin, CEO of Trelleborg Energi.
Denmark-based Everfuel announced it teamed up with Denmark's Taulov Dry Port to build the country's largest hydrogen station. “The location of a hydrogen station in Taulov Dry Port is an important strategic location,” wrote Everfuel.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/22/ja-solar-brings-its-m10-solutions-to-the-european-market/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WEBINAR PARTNER JA SOLAR,WEBINAR PARTNER JA SOLAR",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 22, 2022",JA Solar brings its M10 solutions to the European market,"pv magazine: Mr. Espinosa, JA Solar has decided to bet on the 182 mm M10 format rather than on the 210 mm M12 size as other major manufacturers. Do you believe this choice is now bearing its fruits? 
Ignacio Espinosa: We really feel the 182 mm is the next step on the PV technology evolution. Wafers with too large a size bring challenges for the production process, packaging and transportation. But our major concern about the resultant 210 mm modules is their high-current output. The high current is impacting over power generation as high current brings higher resistance losses and a higher inner temperature inside the modules, which translates to operance losses. 182 mm modules are more balanced in terms of their dimensions and electrical values.
Is the M10 format suitable for any market segment and all kinds of projects? Would the M12 size represent the best option in cases of low-irradiance conditions? 
M10 format modules have different choices for all market segments. We are offering a 54-cell format that it’s suitable for residential and C&I segments. Due to its reduced dimensions and light weight it’s perfect for rooftop installations. On the other hand, we are also offering 72-cell formats reaching 545 W, which is the mainstream product in the industry nowadays as it is suitable for C&I and ground-mounted systems. We are also starting the mass production of the 78-cell format soon, a product that is aimed at ground-mounted systems being around the 600 W power output range.
The company is now bringing its M-10 solutions to the European market, which is an extremely diversified one in both geographical and environmental terms. What advantages do these panels bring to European developers? 
The main advantage is the high versatility that they have due to the different formats available, which implies different sizes and therefore a perfect adaptability to the needs of each project. On the other hand, the balanced electrical skills of M10 modules make them widely compatible with the rest of the PV elements and brings them high-performing ratios, which is actually the main advantage that they bring to European developers and end users.
JinkoSolar, Longi and JA Solar have reached a consensus on the standardization of PV modules produced with 182 mm (M10) wafers. How important is this standardization process? 
We were living in a transition moment where different manufacturers were designing different but basically similar modules using M10 wafers. At the end of the day, it represents a big headache for the developers as they needed to change their design depending on the module they were using. It was also an issue for the mounting system manufacturers as they needed to design their systems for several options. The issue was also affecting the supply chain, as the different sizes of the modules were also a problem for modules manufacturers’ raw material suppliers. The solution was to standardize the dimensions and make another step forward to set the M10 modules as the mainstream product for the PV industry in the following years.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/22/netherlands-may-reach-135-gw-of-solar-by-2050/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 22, 2022",Netherlands may reach 132 GW of solar by 2050,"The Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) has published a new report outlining two possible scenarios for the development of the country's energy system towards a fully decarbonized economy by 2050.
Called Adapt and Transform, respectively, both scenarios include a strong development of renewables and hydrogen, and, according to the report's authors, the major shift towards clean energy sources will not lead to higher costs. Energy demand in the country is expected to grow from around 110 TWh currently to up to 500 TWh.
The Adapt scenario is less ambitious and contributes less to achieving the Paris climate goals, with fossil fuels being still partly used as raw materials and emissions from international aviation and maritime shipping being only reduced by half.
The Transform scenario raises the bar much higher, as a radical behavioral change will be needed and far-reaching energy savings will be required to reduce energy demand. Under this scenario, renewables will cover almost all electricity demand in the country by 2050, but power imports will be needed to meet all consumption.
The Adapt scenario envisages that the Netherlands' wind and solar capacity may reach 98.5 GW by 2050, including 36 GW of offshore wind, 7.5 GW of onshore wind, and 55 GW of solar PV, with no nuclear power capacity expected to be in operation. Under the Transform scenario, by contrast, nuclear power may have a share of around 7% thanks to 5 GW of installed capacity and solar reaching 132 GW, offshore wind 70 GW and onshore wind 12 GW, with their total capacity reaching 214 GW.
Under both scenarios, the share of solar and wind in the country's electricity mix will be above 80% in 2030 and over 90% in 2050.
“We will have to strive for the largest possible use of sun and wind for our energy supply and making heavy industry more sustainable,” the TNO experts said. “Nuclear energy can be a necessary and CO2-free supplement to this, but should not overshadow the ambitions for sun and wind.”
The Netherlands reached a cumulative installed PV capacity of 14.3 GW at the end of 2021, according to the Dutch Central Agency for Statistics. The Dutch solar market last year grew by 3.3 GW of newly deployed capacity. By comparison, newly deployed PV systems hit 2.93 GW in 2020, 2.57 GW in 2019, 1.69 GW in 2018, and 853 MW in 2017.

“Ferrocenes are compounds with iron at their center, surrounded by sandwiching rings of carbon,” the researchers emphasized. “The unique structure of ferrocene was first recognized by Imperial’s own Nobel Prize-winner Professor Geoffrey Wilkinson in 1952, and ferrocenes are still being researched around the world today for their unique properties.”
The solar cell has a p-i-n structure and was fabricated with a substrate made of glass and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated with a solution based on poly(triaryl)amine (PTAA), which is an excellent hole transporting and electron blocking material, a perovskite layer, a ferrocene layer, a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, and a top electrode based on gold (Au).
The cell was claimed to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25% and to retain more than 98% of its initial efficiency after continuously operating at the maximum power point for 1,500 hours under stander illumination conditions. “Moreover, the FcTc2-functionalized devices passed the international standards for mature photovoltaics (IEC61215:2016) and have exhibited high stability under the damp heat test (85 C and 85% relative humidity),” the academics stated.
Their findings were published in the paper “Organometallic-functionalized interfaces for highly efficient inverted perovskite solar cells,” published in Science. “We are the first team to successfully boost the inverted perovskite solar cell to a record-high efficiency of 25% and pass the stability test set by the International Electrotechnical Commission,” said CityU researcher Zonglong Zhu.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/22/new-solar-module-cooling-tech-based-on-porous-nanochannels/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 22, 2022",New solar module cooling tech based on porous nanochannels,"Researchers from Syracuse University in the United States have developed a solar module cooling technique based on spray-cooling heat flux dissipation on porous nanochannels.
The nanochannels device was attached to the entire surface of the rear side of a monocrystalline panel measuring 180 mm × 290 mm x 5.45 mm. Several devices can be used on the same module depending on the required extent of cooling. Spray droplets are dispersed over the nanochannels device in order to eliminate the need for a continuous supply of a coolant. The cooling effect is provided by the thin-film evaporation-based phase-change heat transfer occurring in the porous nanochannels device.
“The heat flux dissipation due to the employed nanochannels is introduced for the thermal management of the PV panel,” the scientists explained, noting that the performance of the nanochannels was analyzed in two different cases of spray cooling corresponding to the uniform spray droplet diameter of 400 (Case 1) and 20 μm (Case 2) achieved earlier. “The amount of heat flux removal during such a process is found to be dependent on the surface temperature.”
The final steady-state temperature of the proposed two cases was found to be 30.5 C and 20 C, respectively, which compares to 51.5 C for a reference solar module without any cooling. “Clearly, the finer spray droplets in Case 2 provide a higher heat flux dissipating ability and exhibit a greater extent of PV panel cooling approaching the theoretical limit,” the US group emphasized. “The enhancement in Case 2 as compared to Case 1 also aligns well with the finding in terms of the heat transfer coefficient, thus reiterating the significance of the reported technique of PV panel cooling.”
For Case 2, the average cooling was found to be of up to 31 C and the overall enhancement in the electrical power yield to be 32.8%. No information was provided on the costs of the proposed device nor on its commercial viability.
The technique was introduced in the study “Thermal Management of Photovoltaics Using Porous Nanochannels,” published in energy&fuels.

Disneyland Paris has revealed that a third of its 17 MW solar carport project, to be built in stages through 2023, has now been put into operation.
The array is being constructed by French developer Urbasolar. So far, around 46,000 photovoltaic panels out of the 86,000 planned have been deployed. This operating unit covers more than 7,000 parking spaces and produces 10 GWh of solar electricity per year.
The array is expected to generate 31 GWh of electricity per year upon completion and will produce enough renewable energy to supply around 17% of the park's current electricity consumption. Upon completion, part of the installation will light up at night in the shape of Mickey Mouse's head, visible from above.
The plant will also protect visitors' vehicles from the weather. Construction, which started last July, will be completed in 2023.
Geothermal energy is already supplying electricity to the theme park via a power station located at Villages Nature Paris. It transforms the heat and steam naturally present in the ground to cover the heating needs of Disney Parks and the Disneyland Hotel.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/22/pushing-the-boundaries-of-low-head-pumped-hydro-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 22, 2022",Pushing the boundaries of low-head pumped hydro storage,"Low-head pumped hydro storage (PHS) is a storage technology that has had a very limited development to date compared to conventional high-head pumped hydro technologies, mostly because of high upfront costs, a high levelized cost of storage (LCOS), and limited flexibility to provide ancillary services. Low-head projects, however, may be more sustainable in terms of environmental impacts and could be developed in regions without natural elevation differences available that are unsuitable for high-head projects.
With this in mind, two different research groups have provided, in separate analyses, an extensive overview of how this storage technology may get closer to commercial viability. “Low-head pumped hydro storage projects have been designed but never constructed,” reads one of the two papers.
Low-head hydropower and the related option for deploying pumped hydro storage refers to facilities where the head, which is the distance between the hydro intake water level and the water level at the point of discharge, is typically less than 20 meters.
In the paper Low-head pumped hydro storage: A review of applicable technologies for design, grid integration, control and modelling, published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, a European research group has explained that low-head PHS could approach commercial feasibility by offering a storage capacity able to provide balancing in the timescale of hours to days, which would places this technology in the middle between lithium-ion storage for short-term storage and hydrogen for long-term storage.
The researchers identified three main areas where improvements should be made to make low-head PHS technically and economically competitive: Pump-turbine design and configuration; grid integration; and electrical machines and control.
As for the first aspect, the scientists pointed out that the choice of pump-turbine design is strictly dependent on the overall flow rate of the system, with axial flow pump-turbines being indicated as the most suitable option for high flow rates, which leads to higher power outputs.
For the grid integration, they concluded that the combination of grid-forming control alongside bulk energy storage will be crucial for the future adoption of low-head PHS. “To ensure grid stability, such systems will need to provide synthetic inertia next to other ancillary services, namely steady state voltage control, fast reactive current injections, short circuit currents, black start, and island operation capability,” they stated.
Referring to the third area, the academics found that axial flux permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs) are the most promising electric machines for low-head PHS due to their high efficiency, high power density, and suitability for high-torque-low-speed operation.
“There are considerable opportunities for further research to improve low-head pumped storage technology and facilitate economic viability,” the research group concluded. “Firstly, a detailed economic analysis incorporating a predicted increase in revenue from energy arbitrage and the provision of AS combined with improved control strategies optimized for these may serve as a further proof of concept.” The group includes academics from the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, the Technische Universität Braunschweig in Germany,  and the Ghent University in Belgium.
In the second study, entitled Low-head pumped hydro storage: A review on civil structure designs, legal and environmental aspects to make its realization feasible in seawater and also published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, other researchers investigated how low-head PHS may be deployed in shallow seas or integrated into coastal defenses.
According to their analysis, the most important factors to consider in developing similar projects should be assessing new reversible pump-turbine technology, the maintenance of electrical and mechanical components in seawater, methods for identifying adequate locations, ecological and morphological effects as well as the construction of innovative structures and dealing with legislation of different regions. Floating solar was also identified as a technical solution that could provide a mutual benefit with hydropower reservoirs by reducing evaporation while also cooling down solar module temperatures.
The scientists found the low-head PHS in shallow seawater may achieve an LCOS of between €40/MWh and €140/MWh. “Thus it is shown that low-head SPHS can be a competitive technology for integrating variable renewable energies into the grid,” they concluded.
This research group comprises researchers from the Technische Universität Braunschweig and the Universität Stuttgart in Germany, the Delft University of Technology, and the University of Tuscia in Italy, among others.

The hydrogen generation facility will be initially powered by a photovoltaic plant, but Essent may also resort to wind power for periods when the sun is not shining. The energy company also plans to deploy some battery storage capacity at the plant for the temporary storage of the surplus of solar power that cannot be immediately converted into hydrogen or supplied back to the grid.
“It is the first project in the Netherlands in which a ground-mounted and floating solar park, batteries and an electrolyzer are used for sustainable hydrogen production, while simultaneously solving grid congestion and ensuring a balanced energy network,” Essent said in a statement.
Essent and Solinoor will also partner on supplying the hydrogen produced to local customers, which is expected to be done via road transport or direct pipeline. “Green hydrogen is produced from sustainable electricity. Solinoor is developing solar parks throughout the Netherlands that can be used as an electricity source for the production of hydrogen,” said Solinoor director Vahid Kharidar. “We believe that there is always a solution for our industry to move to 100% green energy, even when we have challenges with limited transport capacity on the grid.”
According to Essent,  potential customers will be given the option to immediately switch to 100% hydrogen, but can also to initially use a mix of hydrogen and natural gas, and switch completely to hydrogen at a later stage. “In this way we help entrepreneurs to make the transition to a green future in a responsible, controlled manner,” Essent's statement reads.
The energy provider, which operates across the Benelux energy market, was acquired by German energy company RWE in 2009.

Gujarat’s Swaminarayan Akshardham temple now has 10 portable solar rooftop systems complementing its existing 200 kWp solar system to replace conventional polluting fuels effectively.
Called PV Ports, the systems at the temple complex in the Gandhinagar district were installed under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s initiative to develop renewable energy in cities across India.
PV Ports are standard plug-and-play photovoltaic systems with a minimum of 2 kWp, designed by German development agency Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ). These come with or without battery storage. 
Unlike conventional rooftop solar systems, the PV Port systems can be easily installed by a single person without the need of rewiring and civil work, and allow the space below the panels to be utilized. The systems are highly cost-effective, require low maintenance, and have a long shelf life of 25 to 30 years. These are designed for 100% self-consumption and no power is fed into the grid. Each system leads to an average annual savings of INR 24,000 ($314) on electricity bills.
The PV Ports were manufactured by New Delhi-based Servotech Power Systems Limited (SPSL), a leading manufacturer of high-end solar products, LEDs, oxygen concentrators, and EV charging equipment, under the Make in India initiative.
“Solar energy has to play an important role in reducing the country’s dependence on conventional sources of electricity,” said Raman Bhatia, SPSL's founder and managing director. “The unique PV Port system is the way ahead for greater adoption of solar power in the country. We are thankful to GIZ and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy for this opportunity to contribute to ushering in a renewable transformation.”
The PV Port systems were inaugurated in the presence of Shwetal Shah, an advisor with Gujarat's Climate Change Department and officials from the Gujarat Energy Research & Management Institute (GERMI) and the Swaminarayan Akshardham temple.
“Such collaboration and the resulting synergies are expected to benefit consumers to a huge extent,” said Joerg Gaebler, principal advisor at GIZ. “We are very optimistic that the partnerships will provide us insights to deal with emerging challenges and capitalize on city-level opportunities, which will help us replicate the results in other cities across India.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/22/canadian-university-to-be-equipped-with-a-stealthy-solar-facade-microgrid/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CANADA",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 22, 2022",Canadian university to be equipped with a stealthy solar façade/microgrid,"From pv magazine USA
Mitrex, based in Toronto, is a manufacturer of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). One of the company’s BIPV products is a solar façade, essentially an exterior wall with productive photovoltaics stealthily integrated into a building.
Mitrex said it is now planning the tallest solar façade in North America, a 6,000 square foot BIPV system that will power a student residence building at St. Mary’s University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The decentralized energy source supplies local energy and is connected with the traditional grid to export excess production. It is also a microgrid, capable of functioning autonomously from the electric grid, and able to operate during power outages.
The microgrid application not only can be used for power resilience during outages but can also be intelligently operated to adapt to economic conditions, potentially providing the university with savings during times of high energy prices and peak demand.
Mitrex will work with DSRA Architects, Dillon Consulting, BMR Structural Engineering, to install the project, with construction overseen by EllisDon Corporation and Markland Construction. Construction is expected to be complete in early 2023.
Mitrex said the façade will consist of solar cladding, accented by vertical, semi-opaque solar glass integrated into the windows. The design of the cladding panels is planned to be a delicate combination of school colors with a subtle reveal of solar technology, said the company.
The BIPV maker integrates photovoltaics with a myriad of locations, including roofs, railings, façades, windows and more. “Mitrex aims for a future where every sun-touched surface generates energy with visually appealing solar products,” said the company in a press release.
“The building community needs to think of micro-grids as a must and not an option and rethink their contributions to carbon emissions on every level from carbon used to make the products to powering the structure post-construction,” said Danial Hadizadeh, CEO of Mitrex.
Today, construction operations and building materials fabrication cause as much as 40% of annual carbon emissions. Hadizadeh said that he believes BIPV will replace “outdated solutions” to improve the carbon footprint of buildings. The company provides a high level of transparency in the total carbon lifecycle of its products.
Mitrex’s solar façade panels come in a variety of colors and designs to match the buildings they are integrated with and have a variety of structural designs that can either let the BIPV lay vertical on the wall or be tilted for increased production.
