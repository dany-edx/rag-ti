(Masdar) is now operational in the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda.
The Green Barbuda project is a hybrid solar, batteries and back-up diesel project, featuring a hybrid PV plant with 720 kWp of solar panels connected to a 863 kWh battery.
It is capable of fully meeting the island’s current daytime energy demand. It will contribute to the nation’s goal of meeting 86% of its electricity needs from renewable sources by 2030, while enabling Barbuda to reduce annual diesel fuel consumption by 406,000 liters and cut carbon dioxide emissions by over 1 million kg.
In the wake of the 2017 Hurricane Irma, which destroyed 95% of Barbuda, the climate resistant plant has been designed to survive high winds.
“The Green Barbuda electricity project has been a truly transformative one for Barbuda. It harnesses our indigenous renewable energy resources and has provided for the transfer of cutting-edge technologies as well as capacity building at the local level to manage the project,” said Prime Minister Gaston Browne. “The project supports Antigua and Barbuda’s efforts to reduce its dependence on costly and volatile imported petroleum fuels and to develop our own renewable energy resources. At the same time, it also enables us in both adapting to and mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change.”
Fully financed by the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD), the power station was developed under the $50 million UAE-Caribbean Renewable Energy Fund, a partnership between AE’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ADFD, and Masdar.
ADFD Director General HE Mohamed Saif Al Suwaidi, said the project took into consideration the country’s high dependence on fossil fuel imports for energy needs despite having the potential to exploit its solar, wind and geothermal power. “This initiative highlights the extraordinary capability of clean energy to drive socioeconomic development,” he said.
The UAE-Caribbean Renewable Energy Fund is aiming to deploy renewable energy projects across 16 Caribbean countries to reduce energy costs, increase energy access and enhance climate resilience. Projects have already been successfully launched in the Bahamas, Barbados, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.
Masdar recently announced financial close on a 1.8 GW phase of the world’s largest solar project, located in the UAE. The company claims to have more than 20 GW of capacity including operational, under construction or advanced development projects in its worldwide portfolio and has set the target of reaching 100 GW by 2030.

Local press in Oman reports the project’s investment exceeds $1.35 billion. Expected to be operational sometime next year, the plant will occupy an area of 160,000 square meters and produce 100,000 metric tons of high-quality metallurgical silicon annually.
The plant’s production process will involve pouring liquid metallic silicon from a furnace into molds, then cooling, casting, grinding and packing the ore for global export.
According to a statement released on the Omani government’s press website, the project reflects the government’s “keenness to encourage local investment and attract foreign investors”, and reflects part of the objectives of Oman Vision 2040, a unit of economic and social planning in the country.
Oman’s Undersecretary for Commerce and Industry at the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Investment Promotion, Saleh bin Said Masan, billed the project as the first of its kind in the Middle East and said the project holds the promise of a more sustainable future for the Sohar Port and Freezone by increasing handling capacity in the years to come.
“This polysilicon project will enhance the status of the Sohar Port and Freezone as a global trade hub. Furthermore, it represents a significant achievement in the region’s economic growth and diversification, meeting the growing demand for metallurgical silicon in the markets of Asia, Europe, and North America,” he said.
The announcement follows news that in January, Chinese solar material manufacturer Shuangliang Eco-Energy Co announced it received a $58.3 million equipment order from United Solar Polysilicon (FZC) SPC and will supply polycrystalline silicon reduction furnaces, hydrogen production equipment, and refrigeration units for the plant.

The hydro-solar hybrid project integrates solar energy, hydropower and a battery energy storage system (BESS). It harnesses solar energy in the day and hydropower at night, while the BESS allows continued electricity generation during the transition between the two. EGAT said an energy management system and weather forecast system have been incorporated to enhance stability of the electricity generation system.
The authority has collaborated with Thailand-based Fisheries Research Center to promote the conservation of aquatic animal species in the area. Fishery is integral to the quality of life of people living in the vicinity of the dam, with many millions of fish released into the reservoir annually. 
EGAT said the solar panels, which cover less than 1% of the reservoir’s total surface area, are installed in a way that allows sunlight to penetrate the water surface without impacting the underwater ecosystem. It noted that it plans to develop a solar-powered shrimp farm in the area, acting as a learning centre so communities can generate income and achieve self-reliance.
The Ubol Ratana Dam project is EGAT’s second floating solar hybrid project developed in accordance with Thailand’s Power Development Plan. The authority is planning to develop 16 floating solar projects across nine of its dams with a total installed capacity of 2,725 MW.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Thailand deployed 3,065 MW of solar by the end of 2022. The country expects renewable energy to constitute more than 50% of its power generation mix by 2037.
Researchers from the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory have assessed 10 Southeast Asian countries including Thailand to have the combined potential to deploy over 1 TW of floating PV. The Southeast Asian solar market is thought to have grown by 13% last year, according to mid-year analysis by the Asian Photovoltaic Industry Association, with Thailand as one of the region’s largest markets.

3,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/11/decarbonizing-aviation-attracts-venture-capital/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,EUROPE,NETHERLANDS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",VALERIE THOMPSON,2024-03-11,Decarbonizing aviation attracts venture capital,"Since 2016, there has been $2.4 billion worth of venture capital flowing to companies developing technologies to decarbonize aviation, according to Dealroom.co, a Netherlands-based provider of global data and intelligence on startups and tech ecosystems.
The segment had a strong start in 2024, noted Dealroom.co senior analyst Lorenzo Chiavarini.
“Aviation is one of the segments where we still don’t have a clear winning technology path to decarbonization to reach 2050 net-zero targets,” he told pv magazine. “In my assessment, it could be a threat or opportunity, either we don’t hit the targets, or we hit the targets thanks to huge investments and technological advances. A third option is we hit the targets thanks to massive social change. That is, flying becomes something we only do if there is no other alternative. So, if we want people to fly, and limit climate disruption and biodiversity collapse, we need to get serious about decarbonizing aviation now.”
Based on Dealroom.co data, a total of $2.4 billion was invested in the so-called sustainable aviation since 2016. “Under sustainable aviation, we include things like electric aircraft, aircraft batteries, and hydrogen aircraft; sustainable aviation fuels such as e-fuels and biofuels, as well as new aircraft models, airships, and software solutions for contrail avoidance,” he explained.
The startups that attracted most of the funding are developing electric aircraft, hydrogen aircraft, e-fuels and biofuels. Biofuel is the most mature of these segments while electric, hydrogen and e-fuels are emerging.
“Funding peaked in 2022 at almost $700 million before dropping 50% to $337 million in 2023,” Chiavarini said. “Interestingly, early-stage investments stayed nearly constant from 2021 to 2023, more than double the level of any previous year. It enabled a strong early-stage startup scene that needs to prove it can scale in the next few years. Also notable, Europe seems to have gained a share of innovation by both the amount invested and the number of rounds.”

Venture capital across all sectors decreased 38% from 2022 to 2023, totaling less than half of the 2021 peak, even considering the hype about artificial intelligence startups. “Sustainable aviation is not exactly mirroring the broader market, as it is such an emerging segment, especially the technologies for electric and hydrogen aircraft and e-fuels,” Chiavarini stated.
The surge in new investments, however, has to be taken with caution. “We are very early in 2024,” said Chiavarini. “It was mainly driven by two very large rounds, namely Swedish startup Heart Aerospace, which makes hybrid-electric regional aircraft, and Ineratec, a German company that aims to use CO2 and green hydrogen as feedstock for synthetic fuels and synthetic chemicals. I would add that it is common to announce rounds in January that were in reality closed at the end of the previous year. In any event, we are seeing both late-stage and early-stage activity, which is a good sign.
According to Dealroom.co, over 400 investors have made at least one bet on sustainable aviation startups. The most active based on the number of deals is Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a fund backed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates, with 8 investments from Series A to Series C, including Heart Aerospace, ZeroAvia, U.S.-based hydrogen aircraft developer, and Viridos, U.S.-based developer of microalgae biofuel.
JetBlue Technology Ventures, the corporate venture arm of the US-based JetBlue Airways, is the most active corporate investor with 6 seed and series A stage investments, including Universal Hydrogen, a U.S. provider of end-to-end hydrogen flight solutions, and Electric Power Systems, a U.S. developer of batteries for electric aircraft.
In addition to the sustainable aviation activity, Dealroom.co tracked $5.6 billion invested in electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) and electric Urban Air Mobility (UAM) startups since 2016. Most eVTOLs do not contribute to the decarbonization of the aviation industry due to a predominant focus on just a few passengers, typically 2 to 8 passengers, and limited flight range, typically less than 300 km.
“They are more about enabling new mobility models in urban and semi-urban areas, with use cases such as fast trips to the airport from urban centers,” Chiavarini said.
“They are comparable to the use cases of helicopters and short-distance private jets today, and they cater to a wealthy customer base. A few eVTOLs focus on longer ranges and more passenger seats, so could contribute to decarbonizations, such as France-based Voltaero and US-based XTI Aircraft.”
The hope is that they will still contribute positively to the development of aviation by pushing forward the use of emerging technologies and making regulators more comfortable with certifying electric aircraft. “But on their own, they are not solving any sustainability problems in aviation,” Chiavarini concluded.

Adani Green Energy Ltd (AGEL), India’s largest and one of the world’s leading renewable energy (RE) companies, has operationalized a cumulative 1 GW of solar capacity at the world’s largest renewable energy park being developed at Khavda, Gujarat. With this, AGEL has achieved an operational capacity of 9,478 MW against its stated goal of 45 GW by 2030.
Gujarat’s Khavda is an ideal location to harness wind and solar resources. The region witnesses 2,060 kWh/m2 of solar irradiation and one of the best wind resources in India, with speeds of 8 meters per second.
The 30 GW Khavda renewable energy park spans a staggering 538 sq km of barren land, five times the size of Paris. The cumulative 30 GW of RE capacity at the park is expected to be completed in the next five years and create over 15,200 green jobs.
AGEL delivered 1 GW at the Khavda RE Park in less than 12 months of commencing the work at the site. This involved installing approximately 2.4 million bifacial solar modules.
AGEL has previously built India’s first and the world’s largest wind-solar hybrid cluster at Jaisalmer. The company said it is set to replicate the success of its 2.14 GW Jaisalmer project by leveraging the project execution capabilities of Adani Infra, the technological expertise of Adani New Industries Ltd (ANIL), operational excellence of Adani Infrastructure Management Services Ltd, and a robust supply chain.
To address the terrain challenges, AGEL’s execution partner Adani Infra deployed underground stone columns to enhance the soil strength that was developed with global collaboration. Specialized corrosion-resistant coatings are being used for solar module mounting structures and switchyard equipment for long-term protection of the plant and equipment in a highly corrosive environment.
AGEL has committed to deploying waterless cleaning robots for the entire solar capacity to address dust accumulation on panels to increase energy output and help conserve water in the arid Kutch region. This will enable AGEL’s water neutrality goals aligned with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6.
AGEL develops, owns, and operates utility-scale grid-connected solar, wind and hybrid renewable power plants. With a locked-in growth trajectory up to 20.8 GW, it currently has an operating renewable portfolio of over 9 GW, the largest in India, spread across 12 states.

8,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/11/transcritical-co2-air-source-heat-pump-for-residential-buildings/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HEAT PUMPS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-03-11,Transcritical CO2 air source heat pump for residential buildings,"Researchers at Brunel University London have developed a new system design for residential heat pumps using transcritical carbon dioxide (CO2) as the refrigerant.
CO2 has a very low boiling point and is considered an ideal refrigerant solution for heat pumps. It is also non-toxic, non-flammable and has a low global warming potential (GWP). “CO2 has a far lower GWP and ozone depletion impact than commonly used synthetic refrigerants and, used in its transcritical cycle, can maintain heat pump performance at lower source temperatures and higher delivery temperatures than most synthetic refrigerants,” the scientists stated.
In the study “Application of transcritical CO2 heat pumps to boiler replacement in low impact refurbishment projects,” published in Heliyon, the research group explained that CO2 heat pumps have been on the market since the beginning of this century and said that a well-known product that is currently on the market is the Eco Cute model for domestic water heating (DWH) introduced by Japanese manufacturer Sanyo in 2001. These devices are commonly able to achieve coefficients of performance (COP) of up to 4 and deliver hot water temperatures up to 60 C.
The scientists said they proposed a transcritical CO2 heat pump design including system modifications that are external to the heat pump cycle and are intended at recovering low temperature heat. Their objective was to create a system with a COP of 3 with the same costs of a gas boiler.
Through a series of simulations, the group designed a 1 kW heat pump system for a UK 91 m2 semi-detached house with hydronic heat distribution and 50 mm external wall insulation added. It consists of a compressor, a gas cooler, an internal heat exchanger, an evaporator, an expansion valve, and receiver.
The heat pump also integrates a subsystem including an air source heat exchanger with frosting and defrosting, and heat storage tanks with phase change materials (PCMs). PCMs can absorb, store, and release large amounts of latent heat over defined temperature ranges. They have often been used at the research level for PV module cooling and the storage of heat.
“The heat source side uses a thermal liquid,” the academics explained, noting that the liquid creates an extra heat exchange stage in the heat pump but allows multiple heat sources to be used, while also lowering the pressure and costs of the plumbing. “The heating side models the transfer of heat from moist air through a frost layer, if present, into the heat exchanger. The frost models build and melt the frost layer in line with da Silva et al.‘s mathematical models. They incorporate the impact of the frost layer on heat transfer and on air flow.”
The simulations showed that the heat pump system can achieve a COP of over 3 for a full year run, with maximum values ranging from 3.5 in the winter to 3.7 in the summer. “The results show the annual total heating and DHW requirement being met with COP of between 3.14 and 3.27,” the researchers emphasized. “Winter defrosting was in operation for up to a third of time. The heat pump was never used for more than 25% of time. Recycling was only significant in the summer, reaching 16% of the heat pump operation time.”
Their analysis also showed that, if assisted by photovoltaic panels or thermal collectors, the COP of the system may potentially be raised to 5.1. “With the solar collectors, and current UK Government grants and energy prices, the CO2 heat pump system can achieve a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of GBP0.20 ($0.22)/kWh, 23% lower than GBP26/kWh for a replacement condensing gas boiler,” they further explained.

Fire and Rescue New South Wales (FRNSW) said the fatal blaze started after a battery was compromised and immediately went into ‘thermal runaway,’ a process where a lithium-ion cell overheats and gives off toxic gases before exploding in flames.
Four people were inside the townhouse at Lake Macquarie when the fire broke out last Thursday. FRNSW said two occupants escaped but two died. The tragedy is understood to be the first fatal fire involving a lithium-ion battery in New South Wales.
An FRNSW spokesperson told pv magazine that a report will be prepared for the New South Wales Coroner who will formally decide the cause of the deaths.
FRNSW and NSW Police have declined to publicly identify the manufacturer of the battery involved in the incident.
FRNSW Commissioner Jeremy Fewtrell said lithium-ion batteries as they can be dangerous when overheated, damaged or compromised, warning that lithium-ion battery-related fires can be “extremely intense and volatile” and challenging for firefighters to extinguish because of the high heat.
FRNSW is leading a cross-industry research program examining best-practice response to lithium-ion battery related fires, end-of-life lithium-ion battery hazard management, electric vehicle fires, and fire propagation in battery energy storage systems.
An outline of the Safety of Alternative and Renewable Energy Technologies (SARET) said “there is a general lack of guidance and provisions in building codes, standards, and legislation in relation to safety to address the potential risks from these emerging technologies and part of the problem is that we do not yet know enough about their probability of failure, their mechanisms of failure and potential consequences of failure.”
In a submission to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Lithium-ion batteries and Consumer Product Safety report in October 2023, the Australian Battery Industry Association (ABIA) said developing an industry-wide platform of data and information sharing on lithium batteries needs to be a priority.
ABIA Chair Stuart Hamilton told pv magazine that without the common platform of data sharing, it will be hard to create legislation, guidelines, education, and training.
“Because of the lithium battery industry’s infancy one of our priorities is the collation and sharing of information through all peak bodies, because there is a significant lack of understanding about lithium batteries which are very complex due to their chemistry variety,” he said.

The 5K0 battery is available in two versions called 5K0 Pro and 5K0 Smart, respectively. The 5K0 Pro system comes without an inverter and the 5K0 Smart is an all-in-one solution including a hybrid inverter.
“The single-phase models will be available in Italy from April with new CEI 0-21 certification, while the three-phase models are being certified for the main European and U.S. markets,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “By the end of 2024, a 7.6 kWh version will be available with a storage capacity of up to 110 kWh for small commercial applications. It can be combined with high-voltage three-phase inverters.”
Each battery unit has a storage capacity of 5.12 kWh, with overall dimensions of 669 mm x 185 mm x 340 mm and a weight of 50 kg. The lithium-ion system uses LiFePO4 as the cathode material and has an ambient operating temperature range of -20 C to 50 C.
The new product has a capacity of 5.12 kWh and is scalable up to 60 kWh. It features a depth of discharge of 100% and a rated charge-discharge voltage of 450 V.
It comes with a 10-year warranty and can purportedly operate for more than 6,000 cycles. It also features an IP65 protection level.
As for the 5K0 Pro system, its inverter has an output of up to 6 kW and a PV maximum input voltage of 600 V. It has 2 MPPTs and, according to the manufacturer, can be oversized by up to 150% through optimizers.
The March edition of pv magazine, out today, is dedicated to energy storage and considers sodium-ion’s chances of toppling lithium-ion, takes a look at compressed air technology, and asks whether big or small is the best approach for African solar and storage.
“It is possible to connect up to four inverters in parallel and use the Weco Gateway app for optimized control of the loads,” the spokesperson stated.

In 2023, every segment of solar in the United States recorded year-on-year growth in installations. Cumulative solar capacity stood at 177 GW by the end of the year, and utility-scale solar developers added 22.5 GW – a record year.
Solar has been on an upswing across the United States, with more than half the states with 1 GW of total installed solar capacity.
The industry has been lifted in part by the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, a spending package for climate and energy. The legislation contains numerous provisions to support the US solar industry, among other clean energy technologies, including a long-term extension of the federal investment tax credit, significant domestic manufacturing incentives, labor standards, energy production tax credits and more.
Since the passage of the IRA, more than $240 billion has been invested in clean energy manufacturing and infrastructure projects, according to a White House report. This includes over $86 billion invested in nearly 300 new solar, wind, and battery energy storage projects.
Tracking this growth, SEIA has released rankings for the top five US states in terms of solar deployment across sectors.

Ohio ranked fifth in solar deployment, increasing its installation totals year over year by 1,230%, with 1.3 GW installed. The state has 3 GW across 20 projects in the pipeline for development.

Colorado ranked within the top five for the first time since 2010, with 1.6 GW installed. This is nearly 10 times the total installed in 2022.

Florida maintained its spot as number three in solar deployment for the fifth year straight, adding a record 3.2 GW in 2023. More than 50,000 residents installed rooftop solar on their homes last year, and nearly half of Florida’s 220,000 residential solar arrays were installed in the last two years.

California ranked second, adding 6.2 GW of new solar. However, the California Public Utilities Commission have significantly damaged California’s rooftop solar sector. In total, the state’s solar market is expected to decline 36% across all market segments in 2024, said SEIA.

Texas has moved to the front for solar installations, adding 6.5 GW in 2023. The 15 GW added since 2021 was more than the entire solar cumulative total installed in the United States in 2019.
“From 2024-34, Texas will lead the nation with nearly 100 GW of new solar capacity additions, outpacing the next closest state by a two-to-one margin,” said SEIA.

According to Inove, Vinci's engineering unit, the new tool can save up to 50% in costs associated with earthworks.
“This new software works with the real cost of clearing and filling to minimize the total cost of a project,” said the company.
The new tool accounts for optimization parameters, design restrictions, mounting structure slopes, and terrain adaptation.
“With these factors, the tool is capable of carrying out the necessary iterations to reach the optimal solution in terms of earthworks cost,”  Inove said.
The new software can evolve and adapt to the specific requirements of clients. It reportedly covers the needs of all project phases, from basic engineering to detailed engineering and construction support. Vinci Energies Spain said it has already been deployed.
