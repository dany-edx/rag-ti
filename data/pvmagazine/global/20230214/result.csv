For two years, hydrogen producers will be able to match their hydrogen production with their contracted renewables on a monthly basis. “The decision to allow monthly temporal correlation in a transitional period, to then impose more granular matching (with hourly matching from 2030) will provide a first mover advantage, while preserving the integrity of renewable hydrogen in the long term,” said Arthur Daemers, policy adviser for SolarPower Europe. The commission included an exemption for “low-emission” power grids (nuclear) and for grids with high shares of renewables. The European Parliament and the European Council now have two months to either accept or reject the proposals.
The Port of Corpus Christi Authority (PCCA) and Canada's AmmPower have agreed to develop green hydrogen as feedstock for green fuel and green derivatives production, storage, and distribution. “PCCA has emerged as the nation's preeminent gateway for exporting low carbon energy to international markets due to PCCA's ability to provide access to a deep draft channel, land for site location and close proximity to renewable energy,” said Toronto-based AmmPower. The two entities are now checking the feasibility of a facility in Texas to produce green hydrogen derivatives for domestic and export markets. They have not provided any timeline expectations.
Airbus, Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), Air New Zealand, Hiringa Energy, Fabrum, and New Zealand's Christchurch Airport have launched the Hydrogen Consortium “to support the country to pioneer the commercial deployment of green hydrogen-powered aircraft.” The Christchurch Airport is developing a 400-hectare renewable energy precinct. The first phase will focus on research until the end of this year. Hiringa's first four production and high-capacity refueling stations are going online in 2023, with nationwide expansion planned from 2024. Air New Zealand aims to fly its first commercial demonstrator flight from 2026 and begin replacing its Q300 Turboprop fleet from 2030 with low- emission aircraft. Airbus is working to develop and put into service the “world's first hydrogen-powered commercial passenger aircraft” by 2035. 
DEWA and ENOC have agreed to cooperate in a feasibility study to establish, develop and operate an integrated pilot project for hydrogen in the mobility sector. The two companies, both based in the United Arab Emirates, will jointly build a hydrogen fueling station and work on a roadmap for a green hydrogen strategy. The agreement supports the hosting of COP28 in Dubai later this year.
The latest edition of pv magazine is devoted entirely to energy storage, with topics ranging from how battery suppliers can avoid supply-chain related policy risks, to the plans Russia hatched to be a hydrogen superpower – before it invaded Ukraine.

The PV150 solution measures open circuit voltage between 5 V and 1,000 V, as well as short circuit current between 0.5 A and 15.00 A. It also measures earth continuity, insulation resistance, and checks operating current via an AC/DC current clamp.
“With the push of a single button the new hand-held tester carries out the required sequence of electrical tests in a safe and controlled manner, avoiding the risk of contact with exposed ‘live’ DC conductors,” Seaward said in a statement.
The device has enough memory to store up to 200 complete test records. It has USB connectivity, so the test results can be swiftly downloaded to computers.
The unit can also wirelessly capture and record real-time irradiance, ambient temperature, and PV module temperature measurements through a connection with Seaward’s Solar Survey 200R meter. These measurements can be performed at the same time as electrical testing.
“In this way, the combined testing, data logging, and downloading facility enables PV system documentation and test certificates to be completed quickly and without error,” said Seaward.
The PV150 weighs 0.95 kg and measures 26.4 cm x 10.7 cm x 5.8 cm. It is powered by six 1.5 V AA batteries and comes with a two-year warranty.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/14/can-sensmet-crack-lithium/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"FEBRUARY 14, 2023",Can Sensmet crack lithium?,"As international efforts to fight climate change intensify, the main challenge for battery manufacturers and their supply chains is to find new ways to most efficiently meet soaring demand for electric vehicles (EVs).
The laborious batch sampling and laboratory analysis typically used by battery metal manufacturers to control their processes usually takes around four to 10 hours. As a result of this delay, process managers are unable to efficiently adjust the dosing of chemicals.
Consequently, raw materials are wasted and product purity – the most important component for product quality – is difficult to control. Impurities significantly affect the performance of li-ion (lithium-ion) batteries. Sampling for laboratory analysis is also expensive and often challenging to arrange around the clock.
For these reasons, continuous, real-time process monitoring – which our startup Sensmet has successfully developed – has long been a goal pursued by lithium producers.
Sensmet’s Micro-Discharge Optical Emission Spectroscopy (µDOES), enables the multi-metal, real-time analysis of aqueous samples. The online technology is also suited to the “black mass” recycling of battery metals. The patented µDOES technology is based on atomic emission spectroscopy. A micro-discharge (electric spark) is created directly inside the aqueous sample, causing a microscopic volume of the liquid surrounding the micro-discharge to be flash-heated to 10,000 C. Molecular species in the micro-discharge are dissociated into atoms which are excited to their respective higher electronic states. Upon returning to their ground state, the atoms release excess energy by emitting light at their characteristic wavelengths.
The µDOES system measures the atomic emission spectrum to derive quantitative analysis of the metals in the sample. Real-time data are displayed, showing the concentrations and trends for each metal and alarm levels can be set for each element. Results are digitally transferred to user databases and/or the cloud.
In hydrometallurgical processes that cannot be controlled by monitoring pH, direct measurement of dissolved metal concentrations is essential. Alternative monitoring methods have major limitations. For example, x-ray fluorescence is unable to measure lightweight elements such as lithium and sodium and is almost impossible to calibrate for low-concentration impurity measurement.
Given the large sums involved in lithium manufacture, accurate dosing of precipitation chemicals is extremely important. For example, when sodium carbonate is added to a slurry containing beta spodumene under high temperature and pressure, lithium carbonate and analcime solids are formed. If insufficient sodium carbonate is dosed, some of the lithium will not react to form lithium carbonate, and unreacted lithium will be lost in side-product analcime sand. Overdosing is undesirable too, as it results in process chemical waste and excessive chemical costs.
Continuous monitoring is also vital for the reduction of battery metal impurities such as sodium, potassium, copper, zinc, and calcium; all of which can be measured by µDOES at any stage of the hydrometallurgical production and recycling process. Strict monitoring and control can therefore reduce impurity levels.
The mobility revolution has dramatically increased the importance of battery technology and driven high demand for new solutions that can help improve the quality and efficiency of production.
High purity lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate is required for battery manufacture. Impurities represent a significant challenge because they cause poor charging performance, lower the range of EVs, require more frequent charging, offer poorer performance in cold temperatures and, in some cases, can cause overheating.
As the EV market develops, and global battery metal resources start to dwindle, there will be an even greater emphasis on the recycling of used devices. The online µDOES analyzer will help provide a solution because the processes involved with black mass recycling have to be closely monitored and controlled.
The µDOES system can help the battery industry realize effective processes and quality control. Continuous, simultaneous measurements of multiple metal species in an aqueous matrix offers battery metal manufa
cturers the opportunity to improve process efficiency, lower costs, increase throughput, and improve the quality of the final product.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/14/novel-attempt-to-design-solar-cells-based-on-zinc-phosphide/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWITZERLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 14, 2023",Novel attempt to design solar cells based on zinc phosphide,"An international research group led by Switzerland's Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) has looked at the electrical properties of zinc phosphide (fZn3P2), in another attempt to consider its use as an absorber material in solar cells. So far, cells based on fZn3P2 have reached a very limited power conversion efficiency, due to the intrinsic limitations of their electrical properties, such as minority carrier mobility and carrier diffusion lengths.
The scientists described their findings in “Zn/P ratio and microstructure defines carrier density and electrical transport mechanism in earth-abundant Zn3-xP2+y thin films,” which was recently published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells. They assessed the electrical properties, as well as the chemical composition and microstructure, of polycrystalline and monocrystalline Zn3P2 thin films grown on indium phosphide (InP) substrates.
“We demonstrate a device fabrication technique that circumvents challenges arising from micro-cracks present in monocrystalline thin films,” they said. “Temperature-dependent measurements elucidated the defect states and their contribution to the transport in Zn3P2 thin films. We thus show that the growth conditions play a vital role in determining the electrical properties of the given thin films.”
The group fabricated multiple electrical devices based on thin films grown either on doped (both n-and p-type) and undoped InP substrates. They compared their performance with regard to the current-voltage characteristic of Zn3P2/InP heterojunction. They deposited the Zn3P2 films via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).
The academics found that the poly-Zn3P2 thin film has a rough top surface, while the mono-Zn3P2 thin film has a smooth cross-sectional morphology and relatively flat top surface. They also determined that the mono-Zn3P2 thin film has resistivity values in the range of 150 Ω cm to 1,050 Ω cm and the former in the range of 6,500 Ω cm to 9,000 Ω cm.
“The vast difference in resistivity value can be attributed to the presence of grain boundaries in the poly-Zn3P2 thin films, which could contribute to increased scattering of the charge carriers,” the scientists explained.
Additional analysis showed that the mono-Zn3P2 film could achieve higher current density values in comparison to the poly-Zn3P2  device. The researchers attributed the lower current density value of the polycrystalline thin film to the high resistivity in the material.
“High-quality monocrystalline Zn3P2 thin films with moderate carrier concertation demonstrated a high hole mobility (125 cm2/Vs) at room temperature, indicating the growth conditions and composition of the material play an integral role in tuning the material functionality,” the researchers said. “We unveiled the impact of unintentional doping caused due changes in the Zn/P ratio on the electrical properties of the material.”
Their conclusion is that the carrier concentration in the devices is directly correlated to the Zn/P ratio.
“This work sheds light on the electrical properties and conduction mechanism, thus providing a better understanding of the limitations and potentials of the electrical devices related to the material,” said the researchers.
The team includes scientists from Universidad de Salamanca in Spain.

“We address the direct coupling and integration between PV and batteries at a single PV-module scale, so potentially the PV-battery modules are applicable for various scales of PV installations,” researcher Oleksander Astakhov told pv magazine. “In general, a PV-battery module is applicable in different climates and utilization scenarios, at the same time to achieve optimal operation one would need to choose a specific PV-battery combination for one or another climate zone.”
The scientists described their findings in “Efficient Power Coupling in Directly Connected Photovoltaic-Battery Module,” which was recently published in RRL Solar. They noted the need to eliminate MPPT with the costs it adds to PV systems, power overhead due to self-consumption, lower reliability, and higher maintenance.
“In contrast, a direct PV-to-battery connection can be a simple and cost-effective alternative,” they said.
The German group compared the temperature and irradiance maps calculated for coupling factors to temperature and irradiance data from a hypothetical solar plant in Widderstall, Germany.
“The performance of direct connection was evaluated by comparing obtained coupling factor dependences to the power efficiency of power converters used in literature,” they said. “Finally, real charging measurements were used to validate the calculated coupling factor maps and discuss the effect of load.”
The academics tested the direct PV-battery connection on a shingled PV panel based on heterojunction solar cells and a 160 mAh lithium-ion battery. The measurements of I-V curves showed that the proposed combination could maintain a coupling factor of more than 90% in the wide range of irradiances and power outputs.
“Comparing these results to the power efficiency of MPPT devices revealed that direct coupling can provide superior performance at peak conditions and a wider dynamic range, i.e., wider range of high coupling factor on the irradiance scale,” the scientists said. “In the charging measurement, the battery was completely charged by the PV module at a constant 25 C temperature under 1 Sun irradiance resulting in 17.06% overall efficiency. The coupling factor remained above 95% in a major part of the measurement in a wide range of battery state of charge.”
Recently, researchers from the Institute of Energy and Climate Research IEK-5 Photovoltaik proposed the integration of battery storage in hydrogen production systems with PV-powered water splitting electrochemical (EC) cells. The researchers said that directly integrating batteries into such systems, without adding power management electronics, could help to smooth out PV power fluctuations and stabilize the performance of EC components.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/14/after-hitting-rock-bottom-polysilicon-will-rebound-to-a-sustained-price-level/,"SPONSORED,WORLD",,"FEBRUARY 14, 2023","After hitting rock bottom, polysilicon will rebound to a sustained price level","After years of record capital spending, wafer companies that had struggled with shortages of polysilicon are now facing a sudden drop in prices for the material. Businesses that hoarded polysilicon for one or two quarters are now opting to tap into their inventory, while polysilicon makers have at the same time rushed to ramp up capacity. This combination of factors contributed to the recent plummet of polysilicon prices.  
Changes in supply and demand may be the primary drivers of these changes, but JinkoSolar says that’s not all that’s behind the current decreases in polysilicon pricing. Additional factors are coming into play here as a large chunk of the new polysilicon capacity built over the last two years has gone online simultaneously. On top of that, the rapid loosening of China’s anti-pandemic policies has further accelerated the release of supplies. 
As wafer makers reduce their stockpiles of inventory, prices will balance out and remain at a reasonable level, perhaps even staying tight on the polysilicon side since the combined online polysilicon capacity to satisfy 400GW in 2023 still lags far behind the strong wafer manufacturing capacity of nearly 700 GW. That said, polysilicon manufacturers are not motivated to further depreciate costs. According to industry professionals and analysts, polysilicon makers will not brace for a prolonged downturn and will instead rebound and stabilize at somewhere around 100-130RMB/kg (13.74-17.86 euros/kg) over the long-term, because they still have power over pricing compared to the much larger wafer and cell production capacities. Over the last few weeks, signs have been accruing that the polysilicon price downturn that's been going on since August 2022 has slowed down.  
On the other hand, the downward trend in polysilicon prices may not have been fully reflected in the panels, especially given the sharp upward trend in costs of other critical materials, particularly increases for the quartz sand used in the crucible, POE and EVA encapsulant films, and other components. For example, the price of a quartz crucible is about four times the price from twelve months ago. Analysts predict the cost of quartz sand – particularly the price for high-purity sand – will continue to skyrocket due to the even greater gap between supply and demand. 
 The POE/EVA encapsulant film is another key material that will remain in tighter supply, or will even run short this year, due to the longer time necessary for capacity expansion, as well as its higher manufacturing difficulty. With the strong demand spurred by polysilicon price stabilization, 2023 will see a peak in POE/EVA pricing due to the enlarged gap between demand and supply. There is currently no sign of easing, as this shortage is being experienced everywhere. The inevitable rippling effect across the supply chain means end customers will ultimately experience less of a price drop. 
Downstream demand is traditionally soft in the first quarter of the year, given heavy inventory. The depreciation in polysilicon might not be enough to offset the rising cost of the rest of the materials, while shipping costs remain high, according to one panel manufacturer. In addition, panel makers will opt to avoid dropping their prices; instead, they will speed up adoption of n-type technology. 
The p-type panel, which has been losing ground to the n-type since last year, looks particularly vulnerable under this scenario. The drop in polysilicon costs would hammer demand even in market areas that have typically remained solid, such as in price-sensitive segments. DG rooftop market customers will continue to stay away from PERC-centric products, due to the technology’s prolonged depreciation risk and the weakness in energy yield that the market continues to see. 
Price vulnerability fears, among other factors, are making cutting-edge n-type panels the new norm across the solar industry. According to JinkoSolar, more and more end customers, developers, and investors will take advantage of the price affordability to transition toward n-type products, which offer better value for the money and are more resistant to depreciation. 
Many in the solar manufacturing industry have been building up supplies for a demand that is turning out not to be as real as they thought it was. This may be the current reality for material makers and specialized manufacturers, but it’s also the eternal challenge for the whole industry. Only a large vertically integrated and highly resilient operation will be able to survive these ups and downs.

Ultrasonic flow meters use ultrasound to measure the velocity of fluids in a range of fluid applications. Compared to conventional meters, such devices can provide more accurate gas flow measurements by calculating the time difference ratios between ultrasonic paths into a pipe. Panasonic's GB-L1CMH1A solution is a new product based on a technology that it previously developed for gas meters.
The Japanese electronics manufacturer said the system can operate without changing the operating state of the fuel cell. It is able to measure a wide range of hydrogen flow rates and concentrations. It is also equipped with monitoring functions for temperature, pressure, and humidity.
“The temperature, pressure, and humidity in the fuel cell greatly affect the power generation efficiency and durability of the fuel cell itself,” Panasonic said. “In order to improve power generation efficiency and durability, it is important to grasp the internal state of the fuel cell in real time and perform optimal control.”
The company said the device is available for sale in Japan from Feb. 10. “The use of this product is expected to accelerate research and development of fuel cells,” it added.
In 2021, Panasonic unveiled a 5 kW pure hydrogen fuel cell generator for commercial applications. It previously installed the fuel cell in several pilot projects in Japan. The H2 Kibou fuel cell system works with pure hydrogen at a density of more than 99.97% and achieves an electrical efficiency of 56%.

IIT Madras Research Park (IITMRP), India’s first university-based research park, has signed an agreement with US-based manufacturer First Solar to work on the application of thin-film PV technology in India.
The two organizations will cooperate on a range of  R&D activities, including the localization of thin-film solar and other next-generation PV technology supply chains in India, high-volume manufacturing, the testing of PV modules, and high-value recycling.
“First Solar is the world leader in thin film solar and its knowledge and track record in both R&D and high-volume manufacturing represents a tremendous opportunity for India, which is working to secure its clean energy supply chains,” said Professor Ashok Jhunjhunwala, an official from IIT Madras Research Park. “First Solar has demonstrated the potential of thin film to counter China’s dominance of crystalline silicon with high-performance solar panels that are competitive, sustainable, and responsibly produced.”
First Solar produces its thin-film PV modules through a fully integrated, continuous process. Its eco-efficient module technology uses its proprietary cadmium telluride (CadTel) semiconductors.
“The [agreement] covers a number of areas that directly support India’s decarbonization, energy independence, and sustainability goals and we would be pleased to share our experience, while also benefitting from the institution’s expertise in areas such as field testing,” said Kuntal Kumar Verma, chief manufacturing officer of First Solar.
In 2021, First Solar announced plans to invest in a vertically integrated thin-film solar factory in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, with an annual capacity of 3.3 GW DC. The facility will be commissioned in the second half of this year.

Brazil has surpassed 25 GW of installed solar capacity, equivalent to 11.6% of the country's electricity mix. The utility-scale PV sector accounts for 7.8 GW and distributed generation for 17.2 GW.
Since July 2022, PV in Brazil has grown by an average of 1 GW per month, according to ABSolar. The country had a cumulative capacity of 16.4 GW in July, 17.5 GW in August, 18.6 GW in September, 21.1 GW in October, 22 GW in November, 23 GW in December, and 25 GW in February 2023.
ABSolar says that this capacity has attracted BRL 125.3 billion in new investments to the country.
In January, the Brazilian authorities introduced new rules to ensure that PV systems below 3 MW in size will still be eligible for net-metering tariffs until 2045.
A grid fee for prosumers went into effect this year, but the economic profitability of rooftop PV and small solar parks is expected to remain high. The strong growth recorded in 2022 was also related to the introduction of this grid fee starting from January.

California’s net-energy metering (NEM) policy has been a key driver of the state’s solar deployment, incentivizing adoption by allowing utility customers to sell excess power generated from rooftop solar back to the grid for a profit. With approximately 1.5 million homes and businesses participating, policies like this have made California a clean energy leader in the United States, and even the world. However, the California Public Utilities Commission recently changed the solar-friendly policy.
The approved new framework (known as NEM 3.0) is expected to slash the rate paid for solar energy sold back to the grid by 75%. This revision significantly lengthens the five- to seven-year average payoff period for installing solar and puts the growth of solar power at risk. Californians must embrace an additional clean energy technology in order to shorten payoff periods and continue the momentum behind solar: batteries.
Under the new NEM 3.0 rate structure, the value of excess solar generated during the day is diminished. But, there is a strategically designed loophole – homeowners and businesses can maintain the value of solar power generated by incorporating a battery into their system. The battery can store excess energy for later use, including hours of the day when energy demand and prices are at their highest.
This new structure will benefit the California power grid by reducing dependence on fossil fuels during peak demand periods. As a state that commonly experiences electricity supply shortages and rolling blackouts, California has the opportunity to mitigate these issues by leveraging batteries and renewables as distributed energy resources. Further, battery systems will enable California businesses to accelerate their paths to decarbonization, which regulation will mandate in the coming years.
As demand for solar-plus-storage grows, lithium-ion battery manufacturers are racing to keep pace. However, despite the urgent need for storage as electricity prices skyrocket and grid reliability nosedives, many home and business owners remain hesitant. Lithium-ion batteries have their own risks, including rising costs and fire hazards.
In 2022, the average lithium-ion battery pack price reversed its downward trend and rose 7% to $151/kWh. As of 2021, first costs (including cost of all hardware and cost of full installation) for a 10 kWh to 14 kWh residential battery system were in the range of $10,000 to $15,000 before state-specific incentives, which is cost prohibitive for the average homeowner. Lithium is also an inherently flammable material that can make batteries a liability rather than an asset.
Lithium battery fires burn hot and fast, and are difficult and dangerous to extinguish. Burning batteries also release a range of toxic gasses harmful to humans and the environment. While it’s true California needs battery storage, it will require innovation beyond lithium for mass adoption to meet the scale needed.
The next wave of clean technology adoption must take advantage of batteries that are inherently safe and affordable. Non-lithium energy storage alternatives exist, and many more are currently being developed. These new battery technologies can help California ensure that NEM 3.0 has no adverse effects on the clean energy transition, and instead kick it into high gear.
Once deployed at scale, these new battery chemistries will serve as invaluable assets to help shape the clean and resilient power grid of the future. Much like solar panels once were under previous NEM policy, batteries will respond to and be rewarded for giving energy back to the grid when it’s most needed.
