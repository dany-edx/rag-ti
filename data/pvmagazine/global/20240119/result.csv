German energy company RWE announced it completed a 3.2 MW agrivoltaic project on a 7-hectare recultivation area on the edge of the Garzweiler opencast mine near Bedburg, a town in the Rhein-Erft-Kreis district of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
The utility said it will test three different agrivoltaic system designs for different crops on both arable and horticultural land at the facility over five years. The aim is to develop suitable management methods and value-adding operating concepts for agrivoltaic systems.
RWE also intends to observe the interaction between plant growth and photovoltaic generation under different seasonal weather conditions over the years.
According to the company, the first of the three designs will see the solar modules firmly attached to the mounting system in a vertical orientation. In the second variant, they will be mounted on movable trackers following the sun from east to west. Lucerne, field beans and forage grass will be planted on these two areas in the first year of the trial. In the following years, crops such as grain, sugar beets, potatoes and other vegetables will be grown. The rows of modules are designed so that harvesters can drive through them.
In the third concept, the solar modules will be mounted on a pergola-like structure, with raspberries being grown underneath.
The Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE and the Institute of Plant Sciences at the Jülich Research Center are teaming up with RWE in the testing and analysis of the three systems.

Overall market sentiment remained bearish with many market participants expecting further price cuts ahead of the Lunar New Year festivities in early February. Polysilicon prices were in the range of CNY54-65/kg, OPIS learnt during its weekly market survey.
China produced a total of 1.45 million tons of polysilicon in 2023, up 81.4% year-on-year, data from China’s Silicon Industry Association showed. Current inventory levels stood at 60,000 MT and January’s production is expected to reach 170,000 MT, according to China’s Silicon Industry Association.
Market participants do not expect these inventories to be depleted soon as some companies had already procured January and early February cargoes and said that there was room for prices to fall further in the coming weeks.
The recent increase in wafer prices, stemming from wafer manufacturers trying to recoup previous months’ losses, is not expected to lend any support to polysilicon price gains as wafer demand has yet to recover fully.
Meanwhile, the Global Polysilicon Marker (GPM), the OPIS benchmark for polysilicon outside China was assessed at $26.063/kg on Jan.16, down 30.7% year-on-year tracking price declines in the Chinese market, OPIS data showed.

The commissioning of the first phase of the manufacturing facility with an annual capacity of 700 MWh is planned for the end of 2025, with the full production potential to be reached in 2029. The facility in the Hauts-de-France region will eventually employ more than 1,000 people.
The company will initially manufacture sodium-ion cells for power tools and stationary storage applications in its factory “to fulfill the first orders that have already been received.” It will later target to scale-up production of second-generation products for battery electric vehicle applications.
According to Timat, the new financing round, which brought in €30 million ($32.6 million) in the first phase, will enable the start of the gigafactory construction. Stellantis, Arkema and MBDA were among the new investors, alongside existing investors and the French investment bank Bpifrance.
“We are very pleased to be able to start the industrial project of this project thanks to the renewed support of historical investors and our new partners,” said Tiamat Managing Director Herve Beuffe. “We will be able to produce our technology locally and mass-market it, and this address the issues of sovereignty and availability of materials generated by conventional energy storage technologies.”
Tiamat expects to complete the financing of its industrial project in the coming months with “an additional equity raising of a similar size with the entry of new investors, as well as a mix of debt and subsidies”, bringing the total financing to around €150 million.
Tiamat is a spin-off of the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and was founded in Amiens in 2017. It recently became the first company in the world to have commercialized a sodium-ion technology in an electrified product.
The company’s first gigafatory will be located in the so-called “battery valley,” in the Hauts de France region, which has recently become the hotspot of battery manufacturing in the country, after the closure of its mines and most of the steel industry.
Previously, lithium-ion battery makers AESC, ACC, Verkor unveiled plans to establish gigafactories in the region. Taiwanese solid-state battery specialist ProLogium has picked Hauts-de-France for its first manufacturing plant abroad.
Mining and metals group Eramet and environmental services group Suez have decided to locate their EV battery recycling plant in Dunkirk, near the border with Belgium, whereas Chinese group XTC and France’s Orano have unveiled plans for the production of cathode material for lithium-ion batteries not far away.

Frontier Energy said it will add a battery energy storage system (BESS) to a 120 MW (DC) solar facility at the Waroona Renewable Energy Project, following a change in a Western Australian government policy that makes the development of storage systems more financially attractive.
Energy Policy WA recently adopted a four-hour BESS as the reference technology for benchmark reserve capacity (BRCP), marking a change from the previous reference technology of an open-cycle gas turbine.
The government said a 200 MW/800 MWh battery with a 330 kV connection was selected as the new benchmark technology, allowing for a four-hour battery to receive 100% of the reserve capacity payments (RCP).
The reserve capacity mechanism is designed to ensure that there is adequate generation capacity available in Western Australia’s Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM) to meet expected peak electricity demand. The mechanism is unique to Western Australia.
Frontier Energy said the RCPs for an 80 MW four-hour capacity battery are forecast to generate approximately AUD 24 million ($15.73 million) in revenue in 2026-27.
The Perth-based company said combining solar with battery energy storage provided the strongest financial returns with the lowest capital commitment, while also offering a lower technical risk compared to alternatives.
“Integrating battery capacity enhances the project’s returns, compared to solar alone, through increased revenue from reserve capacity payments (RCPs), energy storage arbitrage, and reducing curtailment,” the company said.
Frontier Energy Chief Executive Officer Adam Kiley said that including the battery in the first stage of the Waroona project, now under development near the town of the same name about 120 kilometres south of state capital Perth, makes financial sense.
“Batteries have always been considered by the company, as it is logical to store solar energy generated during low-priced periods for dispatch during higher priced periods,” he said. “Including this at the project now makes financial sense, given changes to BRCP payments, whilst capital costs and efficiency of batteries have also improved significantly.”
Kiley said including the battery would mean only minimal delay in the release of the definitive feasibility study (DFS) which is expected to be announced in February. Frontier Energy is working toward a final investment decision (FID) and construction during 2024.
The Waroona project, which has approvals in place for 241 MW of solar, is being developed adjacent to Frontier’s Energy’s Bristol Springs project which has development approvals for 355 MW of solar generation.
The development of a solar plant is a key element of the company’s long-term strategy to build a renewable energy hub that also includes green hydrogen production, as well as green hydrogen consumption in a hydrogen-fueled peaking power plant.
Frontier Energy’s plans have however received a set back with the project not advancing to the next stage of the federal government’s Hydrogen Headstart program which is provides AUD 2 billion in funding to support large-scale renewable hydrogen production projects.
Kiley said it was disappointing to not advance to the next stage of the program, but the company remains “committed to this sector in the long term and will continue to assess future opportunities to add further renewable energy capability to the project.”

Avaada Group has signed a deal with the government of the Indian state of Gujarat to set up 6 GW of hybrid wind-solar projects with an investment of about $4.8 billion.
The agreement was signed on the sidelines of the recent Vibrant Gujarat Summit 2024.
The hybrid projects will be located in various parts of Gujarat, mainly in the underdeveloped wastelands of Kutch. They will supply power to the various utilities in India and for self-consumption by Avaada for its green hydrogen/ammonia projects.
The projects are expected to generate 17.5 billion units of green electricity per year. The company said the project development process will generate 1,200 direct and indirect jobs.
“Renewable energy along with green hydrogen and its derivatives have emerged as powerful substitutes for fossil fuels, driving rapid decarbonization across various industries and regions,” said Vineet Mittal, chairperson of Avaada Group. “With its abundant natural resources including 300 sunshine days, availability of vast wasteland and long coastline, Gujarat has the potential to significantly contribute towards meeting the global demand for alternative solutions for fossil fuels.”
In addition to the new 6 GW of capacity planned in Gujarat, Avaada has 2 GW of projects under operation or in various stages of development in the state.

The company, which was founded in 2016, said it will use the funds to accelerate towards commercialization, investing in research and development and plans for its first manufacturing facility.
The round was led by existing investor Planetary Technologies, an early-stage venture capital firm, joined by new compatriot investor Uncorrelated Ventures.
The new capital is a validation of the venture’s progress in terms of stability, power conversion efficiency, and module size, according to Tandem PV, CEO, Scott Wharton. “Everyone talks about durability and stability, but we are able to demonstrate it,” he told pv magazine.
“Our indoor tests are showing 80% performance after 25 years equivalent. The encapsulated tandem module’s power conversion efficiency is 26% with conventional PERC cells,” said Wharton, adding that the modules measure 100 cm2, with newer ones at 300 cm2.
The company did not provide more details about the module and cell technology.
Tandem PV is one of multiple teams using the US Department of Energy’s PV Accelerator for Commercializing Technologies (PACT) for independent performance and reliability testing for all varieties of perovskite PV modules and mini modules, including field testing.
To date, the company has raised $27 million in venture capital and government support. It expects the latest financing round to help bring in customer agreements and to begin building the first plant. The next steps for this year are third-party validation of the performance metrics, specifically efficiency and durability, and to take part in outdoor testing programs.
The seasonal, December and January edition of pv magazine reveals the much-anticipated winners of this year’s pv magazine Awards. We also consider the ramifications of the current global oversupply of solar panels, Australia’s prospects of refining battery raw materials, and examine how the European Union’s green hydrogen ambitions are developing.
The performance tests are the latest step that seven-year-old Tandem PV is taking toward commercializing its mechanically stacked panels. It has fabricated 100 cm2 panels which have passed IEC 61215 accelerated tests with academic partners, and has received initial data on passing triple-length duration IEC 61215 tests, as Colin Bailie, CTO, told pv magazine in a 2023 interview.
The initial application Tandem PV will target is utility-scale PV*.
*This article was amended on 19 January 2024 to insert the correct initial application as utility-scale PV and not rooftop as was originally noted.

Brazilian solar power production will have outperformed December expectations, with most of the country's utility scale assets receiving irradiance well above average irradiance. Argentina saw storms through the month, though the south of the country stayed mostly dry and saw some of the highest daily irradiance across the continent.

Brazilian solar producers benefited from a sunnier December than normal, with most areas receiving 20-30% above average irradiance for the month. Anomalous easterly winds kept Amazonian moisture well inland, with reduced cloud leading to less rainfall and increased irradiance. The bulk of Brazilian utility scale assets are concentrated in the East, so will have seen higher than expected production through the month. Rio De Janeiro also saw a sunny month, receiving more December irradiance than they have seen since 2014.

Without the tropical effects further North, Argentina saw a relatively moist airmass, leading to ideal conditions for large convective storms. Several large storms through the middle of the month, and on Christmas day brought flash flooding, and reduced December irradiance well below average. The localized effects can be seen in the daily irradiance figures, including on December 18, pictured above. Conversely, the South of the country received much drier and sunnier conditions, whilst around average for December, with significantly higher average daily irradiance than the North.

Some of the normal expectations from El Niño weather effects have been muted, matching patterns seen around the world. Coastal Ecuador and Peru normally see increased rainfall and cloudiness in El Niño years, but this December saw neutral to slightly above normal irradiance. The Atacama Desert receives the highest levels of irradiance in the world, as the region is on the west coast under the sub-tropical ridge and is sheltered by the Andes mountain range. It saw the highest daily irradiance in the continent in December. The next highest was across Coastal and Southern Argentina, where westerly winds and sunny days were persistent in the lee of the Andes across December.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This information is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets throughout the world.
