GCL Tech, which recently rebranded from its former name of GCL-Poly, said it will hold 60% of a CNY 9 billion venture to source 100,000 tons of granular silicon and to carry out downstream R&D. It will hold the same stake in a separate, CNY 3 billion operation related to a 10,000-ton electronic-grade polysilicon project, with both projects to be based in Honhot, in China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region.
TCL Tech will hold the balance of both operations. GCL Tech announced that its parent, energy company Golden Concord Group, will also be involved in a silicon development framework agreement, along with the Tianjin Zhonghuan Semiconductor business, of which TCL Tech is the biggest shareholder.
The latest capacity expansion bid was explained by the publication this week of first-quarter figures which showed GCL Tech recorded three-month revenue of CNY 6.99 billion. Its profit for shareholders hit CNY 3.03 billion in the January-March window, up from a CNY 2.41 billion profit banked from CNY 8.78 billion of revenue in the first six months of last year.
Some CNY 6.68 billion of that latest revenue figure came from the manufacturer’s solar materials business unit, in which GCL’s new energy-efficient granular silicon made a significant contribution to a three-month gross profit margin figure of 46%. That performance was helped by the fact that the granular product’s margin was consistently 15 percentage points better than that of the company’s traditional rod silicon, according to GCL.
GCL Tech said it produced 18,628 tons of polysilicon in the first three months of the year, as well as 11.6 GW of solar wafers. The manufacturer said it had rod silicon annual production capacity of 45,000 tons at the end of last month, versus 30,000 tons of granular capacity, and was able to manufacture 50 GW worth of wafers per year.

On April 17, Easter Sunday, electricity demand plunged in Spain and photovoltaic solar generation reached a peak power of almost 13.5 GW, which means that it covered up to 62.5% of national demand. The wholesale price of electricity went from €168.50 ($182)/MWh to just €3.70/MWh, according to data provided by Spanish energy forecasting service AleaSoft.
Power generation exceeded what had been programmed and the first PV curtailment in Spain took place – that is, a cut or stoppage of production. Renewable energy generation has been affected by these adjustment mechanisms since 2015, but mostly wind power generation.
“Curtailment occurred last Sunday. A considerable amount of renewable energy was discarded that could have been generated with the existing capacity and the solar resource available that day,” a spokesperson from Aleasoft told pv magazine.
The production curve of solar for Sunday shows that between 2:50 p.m. (CEST) and 4:00 p.m. there is a decrease in production with this technology, falling from 10,710 MWh registered at 2:40 p.m. to 9,689 MWh at 3:50 p.m. Additionally, some producers posted on social media that the grid operator, Red Eléctrica de España (REE), told them to stop production.
The Aleasoft spokesperson explained how this mechanism is activated.
“REE monitors the operation of the electrical system in real-time to guarantee the generation-demand balance. When it detects a situation like the one on Sunday, in which the demand was low and the renewable energy production was higher than scheduled, it first activates all the existing adjustment mechanisms, such as the regulation bands, and, if it is not enough, it communicates with generators to disconnect or reduce production,” he stated.
He said there has been a failure in the REE forecasting mechanisms. If there had been a better forecast of demand and generation, the adjustment mechanisms could have been used to a greater extent and at the right time.
According to a recent study from the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), regulations that completely prevent PV curtailment could end up restricting the ability of grid operators to use solar power for ancillary services, according to new research by NREL scientists.
In “Too much of a good thing? Global trends in the curtailment of solar PV,” which was recently published in Solar Energy, the NREL team analyzed how PV curtailment is handled in four mature solar energy markets: Germany, Chile, the United States, and China. They found that in 2018, the curtailment of solar power in these countries hit 6.5 million MWh, to account for around 1% of total PV power generation.
“Some policies require generators to be compensated for reduced production, and some interconnection policies prohibit systems from interconnecting if those systems are going to lead to curtailment,” the researchers said.
According to Aleasoft, the opportunities for participation and the role that storage technologies are going to play in the electrical system in the coming years are becoming more obvious and clearer. Hourly price differences of more than €100/MWh within the same day in the Iberian electricity market have become relatively common. These price differences are an opportunity for energy storage technologies. In addition, these will also be very important in the adjustment services to provide a rapid response to the needs of balancing the electrical system.

The manufacturer and solar developer, which is owned by electrical equipment company TBEA, wants its investors to back a plan to issue 300 million shares – 17.34% of the stock of the enlarged company. It aims to drum up half the cash required to build a poly fab in Xinjiang capable of producing 200,000 tons of the solar panel raw material annually.
Xinte shareholders will vote on the share issuance at an extraordinary general meeting on May 5.
Solar boom
Pointing to booming global demand for solar, Xinte said even with a 100,000-ton polysilicon fab in Inner Mongolia due to be completed this year, the more than 1 million tons worth of solar wafer orders it has received from companies such as Longi and JA Solar mean it has locked up sales for three to five years.
That Inner Mongolia facility will double Xinte's annual poly production capacity and the company wants to double the number again by June 2024, with a 200,000-ton, CNY 17.6 billion site at the Changji Zhundong Industrial Park, to be built in two 100,000-ton stages.
Under the manufacturer's plans, construction of the 12-month first phase of the Xinjiang fab would start next month, with the second stage built from June next year. The other half of the investment cost will be sourced from “bank loans and other methods,” Xinte said in an announcement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange this week.
Silicon production in Xinjiang is a controversial issue outside China – particularly the topic of whether forced labor is a part of the solar value chain. The US House of Representatives in December drafted the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which proposes banning all imports from Xinjiang unless it can be proven forced labor played no part in their manufacture.
Party plan
Outlining its plans this week, Xinte highlighted the energy-intensity credentials of the “cold hydrogenation technology” to be deployed at its latest proposed manufacturing site.
Shareholders at the May 5 meeting will also be asked to approve changes to the company's articles of association, which include the formation of a “Communist party” at the business to implement major strategic decisions of the Central Committee of the party and the State Council.
The changes to the articles of association also remove several references to the specific Hong Kong exchange where Xinte Energy is listed and replaces them with references to a generic exchange, hinting that the company may be preparing to move its listing.

The procurement exercise is Meralco's second attempt to seek proposals for around 600 MW of capacity that will have to start providing power by February 2026, and another 250 MW set to begin commercial operations in February 2027. An initial tender for the same capacity was launched in late January, but Meralco said earlier this month that the exercise failed, as no bids were submitted.
The bids were expected to challenge a recent offer made by Terra Solar, a joint venture between Prime Infrastructure Capital and Solar Philippines Power Project Holdings. It proposed the construction of 2 GW of PV and 4 GWh of storage at a levelized cost of energy of PHP 6.08 ($0.12)/kWh.
Through this second tender, selected bidders will be granted a 20-year power purchase agreement. Interested developers have until June 6 to submit expressions of interest.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/20/district-heating-via-solar-powered-heat-pump-using-industrial-waste-heat/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 20, 2022",District heating via solar-powered heat pump using industrial waste heat,"Scientists at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE are developing a research project to evaluate how a small municipal district could be provided with heat by solar-powered heat pumps that use waste heat from a distillery at low temperature levels.
“A PV installation will generate a significant share of the power to drive the heat pumps and we are thinking about optimizing PV self-consumption by a small electrolyzer unit,” researcher Constanze Bongs told pv magazine.
The PV system should be able to produce 95 MWh annually, of which around 20% will be used to provide the school with electricity. The electrolyzer unit will produce hydrogen for loss-free storage, which can then be converted back into electricity in winter. The waste heat generated in the process can also be used to heat the school. A significant share of the electricity consumed by the school, the heat pumps and the heating system can be provided by the PV installation based on a yearly balance.
The heat supply is for a school and several multi-family buildings in the municipality of Gutach in Breisgau, southwestern Germany. In the proposed system configuration, the heat demand of the school and the multi-family apartment buildings is met by a heat pump system that uses industrial waste heat from the Elztal distillery, which is located nearby, and heat from ground water wells as low-temperature heat sources. This heat is injected into an ice storage tank to which heat pumps are connected on the source side.
“Heat is transported by pumping water via a 200 m underground tube from the distillery to the ice storage tank,” the project manager, Wolfgang Kramer, told pv magazine. “The PV system produces electricity independently from the pumping demand.”
Climate ceilings will be installed instead of conventional radiators. This is expected to allow the efficient operation of the heat pump system by lowering the flow temperatures in the heating system.
The final design of the system has not been outlined so far. “Therefore, overall efficiencies are not defined, yet,” Kramer added, noting that the heat pump will provide heat and also at least a certain share of domestic hot water.
An energy management system (EMS) will be used to offer additional system services such as control power or the purchase of electricity in the event of negative electricity prices. “Forecast-based control algorithms are being developed and tested for grid-serving operation,” Bongs explained.
Kramer said the system could be an interesting solution for other applications if low-temperature waste heat is available. “It should be in operation in 2023 and evaluated by 2024,” he said.
*The article was updated to reflect that the annual production of the system is 95 MWh and not 95 GWh as we previously reported.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/20/three-year-commercial-pv-payback-expected-via-roof-mount-cost-reductions/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"APRIL 20, 2022",Three-year commercial PV payback expected via roof mount cost reductions,"From pv magazine USA
Solar Atmospheres, a California-based provider of state-of-the-art vacuum thermal processing services, now hosts among the largest commercial solar-plus-storage system in the state on its roof:  a 772kW PV solar system and a 1,561kW/3,122kWh Tesla battery storage system, installed by SunGreen Systems.
Due to the two federal tax incentives the project will receive, additional state-sponsored incentives, and the avoidance of a roof retrofit, Solar Atmospheres expects a full return on investment within 30 to 36 months.
The project uses S-5! mounting products, and S-5! used the opportunity to prepare a case study, outlining the unique challenges resented by the project and how each was overcome. First and foremost, the project footprint is located on twin 20,000+ square foot metal buildings with American Buildings Long Span III trapezoidal, exposed-fastened metal roofing. As for the site’s energy needs, the buildings feature more than 60 furnaces for vacuum heat treating and brazing services.
While 60 standard, single-sized furnaces would provide a more predictable energy load, the 60 stoves in Solar Atmospheres’ buildings range from lab-size research and development furnaces to the largest commercial vacuum furnace, which measures in at a whopping 48 feet long, with a 150,000-pound capacity. According to S-5!, the site experiences very high energy demands and energy charges, so Solar Atmospheres requested the largest solar system the building could handle.
While SunGreen Systems worked on the PV installation, the company brought on one of its partners, Stem, to propose a combined solar and Tesla battery storage system to shave the demand and arbitrage energy.
In developing the solar system with a mind for putting panels wherever they’d fit, SunGreen Systems turned to S-5!, as the company’s products, in this case the PVKIT solar solution and RibBracket III, provided design flexibility in attachment locations. In addition, the lightweight solutions allowed Solar Atmospheres to avoid costly retrofits. The relationship between pv systems and metal roofs is one that S-5! knows well, and SunGreen Systems demonstrated to Solar Atmospheres the solution via a sample kit provided by S-5!. This presentation enabled Solar Atmospheres to find the right clamp for the project by seeing first-hand the factory-installed gaskets that would preserve the building’s integrity.
S-5! also worked with  SunGreen Systems’ installation crew to demonstrate best practices for rail-less installation, including advance module preparation while other crew members completed the electrical work.  S-5!’s PVKIT mounting utilizes clamps designed to grab and attach onto metal roofs, both at the edge and across the surface. The kit’s pre-assembled components enable installers to attach PV modules to the metal roof’s structural seams or ribs vs. a traditional rail mounting system.
In total, the installation exists over a 52,500-square-foot project footprint, made up of the two rooftops and a carport. Of the installation’s 772 kW of capacity,  570 kW are contained on the two roofs. The installation is made up of 1,494 United Renewable Energy 380 W panels and 14 Tesla Powerpacks.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/20/natural-hydrogen-how-it-works-and-why-companies-are-interested/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 20, 2022",Natural hydrogen – how it works and why companies are interested,"From pv magazine Australia
In April, the newly formed Western Australian company HyTerra announced plans to acquire 100% of Neutralysis Industries. Neutralysis, also Australian, holds a stake in an established Nebraska project alongside Natural Hydrogen Energy, a company with one of the field’s top researchers, Viacheslav Zgonnik, at its helm. The move would effectively be HyTerra’s “in,” giving it access to expertise, room to demonstrate, and a wellspring of naturally occurring hydrogen.
While the world has known for many decades about hydrogen accumulating under the earth’s surface, the phenomenon has largely been ignored. The main reason for that, HyTerra Business Development Manager Luke Velterop told pv magazine Australia, is simply because there’s previously been no market for it. Hydrogen is finicky to handle and in the past oil and gas have been considered just fine.
Now the urgent need to decarbonize has changed that, opening up new avenues of interest. In February, pv magazine reported that in the past year, exploration licenses amounting to one-third of South Australia’s total landmass have been either granted or applied for by companies in search of natural hydrogen.
As HyTerra Executive Director and Chief Technical Officer Avon McIntyre explains, it isn’t that South Australia is particularly bountiful in natural hydrogen accumulations, but simply that the state leads the country in terms of exploration regulations for the nascent industry. Accumulations, he says, may well be found all across Australia. And HyTerra and a handful of other companies are vying to secure them first.
Two mechanisms
While there remains some debate natural hydrogen, which has until now rarely been a focal point, there is consensus around the two main ways underground accumulations of the molecule develop.
The first, called “serpentinization,” is an underground reaction between iron and water. As McIntyre, who spent 13 years at Shell as an exploration geologist explains, the reaction occurs when water comes into contact with iron rich rocks below the atmospheric incursion level.
“Then those iron-rich rocks, they effectively want to rust, they want to turn into iron oxides … so they will strip the oxygen atom off the H2O and that releases the hydrogen,” McIntyre told pv magazine Australia. “This is a well understood process and people have known about it for many, many years. It’s just that nobody’s really considered if this could be an economically viable process.”

It said the “SunJoule” panel can be adapted to different building requirements.
SunJoule is available with either monofacial or bifacial cells and the cell arrangement can be customized according to a client's need, the manufacturer said. The spaces between the cells can be customized from 6 mm to 30 mm.

Customers can choose between simple laminated glass and laminated insulating glass. The glass composition is determined by the manufacturer after calculations considering wind load, glass size, and the chosen support method.
An interlayer film is placed between the solar cells and the glass. Each module can have a maximum size of 2,400 mm x 1,800 mm.
The product was recently used for the 3D-shaped entrance canopy of the Global Zero Emission Research Center the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Tokyo. The PV system has a power output of 6.7 kW.
AGC said the solar cells embedded in the glass can effectively reduce heat transmission, as they block sunlight while harvesting solar energy. The PV devices are also said to create a comfortable space with natural light through the spaces between the cells “like sunbeams through the leaves of trees.”
The company said the BIPV glass has already been deployed at 215 sites since its launch in 2000.

“This is among the highest reported in the literature so far at this size,” researcher Luigi Angelo Castriotta told pv magazine. “We believe that by optimizing the laser processes we can improve the module efficiency by around 50%.”
The scientists used P1, P2 and P3 patterning to interconnect perovskite solar cells, so they could then upscale them into mini photovoltaic modules.
“P1 isolate the substrate connections between adjacent cell while P2 and P3 isolate the active part and the top electrode of adjacent cells, respectively,” the researchers explained, noting that their approach involves the reduction of cell-to-module losses that arise due to the laser processes.
The P3 step is often a source of undesired effects such as back contact delamination, flaking, or poor electrical isolation, due to residues that remain in the trench. These issues are likely due to interactions between the laser and the material that have not been fully understood to date.
The solar panel achieved an output power of 2.3 W on a 192 cm2 area.
“Optimizations of all modules started from the study of the P1, P2, and P3 optimization, followed by refinement of cell area width and by adjustment of the geometrical fill factor,” the scientists said, adding that the proposed manufacturing technique could be applied to modules fabricated with slot-die coating, blade-coating or other deposition techniques.
They described the mini perovskite module in “Reducing Losses in Perovskite Large Area Solar Technology: Laser Design Optimization for Highly Efficient Modules and Minipanels,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials. The research group includes scientists from the University of Rome Tor Vergata and the Institute of Structure of Matter ISM – CNR in Italy, Greatcell Italy, and Technische Universität Dresden in Germany.
In March 2021, the University of Rome Tor Vergata presented a perovskite solar module with a total active area of 42.8 cm2 and aperture area of 50 cm2. The panel was built with 20%-efficient perovskite cells connected in 14 series. It was able to retain 90% of the initial efficiency after 800 hours of thermal stress at 85 C.
Later in June, it unveiled a perovskite solar module with cells based on triple-cation cesium methylammonium formamidinium (CsMAFA).

From the end of 2014, when the Greek government introduced a law reducing solar FIT payments and clawing back “overpayments” made during 2013, Athens-based Solar Ileias Bompaina AE argued that the electricity supply companies it sold its clean power to should also have been required to help the effort to pay down the deficit of the national fund used to pay renewables FITs.
In May 2015, the developer argued that Greek electricity suppliers – companies that buy power from generators and sell it on to energy consumers at market rates – had effectively received illegal state aid by virtue of being exempted from the requirement to return some of the revenue they had banked in 2013, when the FIT rates received by clean power generators had ensured a high price for their energy.
The European Commission said, in December 2018, that the solar developer had failed to prove electricity suppliers had contributed to the deficit on the national FIT payment fund. It also said that electricity generators and suppliers were not in a comparable situation, and that the rebate of FIT payments required from clean power producers did not constitute state aid for electricity suppliers.
When Solar Ileias sought to annul those findings, in March 2019, it was not permitted to do so, as it had not provided sufficient evidence of the effect on its business to be classed as an “interested party.” The developer appealed its lack of interested party status in September 2020 and the court announced in April that the appeal has been rejected and Solar Ileias must pay the legal costs of both parties.
