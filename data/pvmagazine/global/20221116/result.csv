The Nordic region is set to become a renewables powerhouse in Europe, with onshore wind accounting for most of the growth at 61.5 GW.
Denmark is expected to lead solar development in the region. Rystad Energy predicts that the country will add 9 GW of PV by 2030, followed by Sweden with 3 GW, and Finland with 0.8 GW. By 2030, Sweden aims to source 65% of its power generation capacity from renewables. Finland has set its target at 51% and Denmark at 55%.
“The Nordics at present produce over 90% of their power (including nuclear) via renewables and are significant electricity exporters to the rest of Europe,” said Francesca Bjørnflaten, senior analyst at Rystad Energy. “That trend will intensify as geography, technology and managerial experience in the region will see renewable investment and generation increase.”
Green hydrogen projects are also poised for substantial growth in the region. Denmark, Sweden and Finland have announced almost 40 separate hydrogen projects, with operations scheduled to start in 2030 or earlier.
“The combined share of electrolyzer capacity for green hydrogen production in the three countries will comprise about 18% of the European market by 2030,” said the report.
Denmark will also lead the uptake of green hydrogen, accounting for 12% of the European market by 2030. Sweden will follow with a 5% share, as it is looking to use green hydrogen to decarbonize its steel industry.
According to the latest statistics, Denmark had an installed PV capacity of more than 2 GW by the end of 2021, while Sweden and Finland stood at 1.59 GW and 395 MW, respectively.

Chile has enacted a new law on energy storage and electromobility, following its approval in parliament in October.
“This law promotes the participation of renewable energies in the electricity matrix, allowing their storage and avoiding the dumping of the generated production,” said the Chilean Ministry of Energy.
The main features of the law include the possibility of compensating standalone storage projects to inject energy into the grid, in addition to being available at times of peak demand. It may also accelerate the retirement of coal-fired power plants.
In addition, the law seeks to reduce the cost of circulation permits for electric vehicles for periods of eight years. EV owners would be exempt from paying fees in the first two years, followed by a gradually rising fee. The measure would reportedly bring the price of EVs down to the level of internal combustion engine vehicles, which are about 65% cheaper at present.
“We are entering a period which will allow the development of flexible renewable energies. We need to encourage the use of clean technologies that allow the grid to respond during peak demand times to stop depending on fossil fuels,” said the Chilean Minister of Energy Diego Pardow. “This is the only way to decarbonize our energy matrix.”

India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has decided to waive solar import duties, in a move that will benefit up to 6 GW of already bid-out PV projects, according to a new report by CRISIL Ratings.
Tariffs for the projects will increase by about $0.0062/kWh to $0.0086/kWh, as the developers will be allowed to pass on the impact of basic customs duties on cells and modules under a so-called “change in law.” The higher tariff will remain well below the average power purchase cost for distribution companies (discoms) in India, according to the report.
The imposition of basic customs duties (BCD) would have affected 17 GW of PV projects granted between Oct. 1, 2019, and March 9, 2021. These projects were likely to procure modules after April 1, 2022, and could not have factored the customs duties in their bid tariffs.
“Based on our discussions with industry players, we estimate that for 50% to 60% of the 17 GW capacity, modules may be procured domestically, keeping it out of the ambit of duty. For another 10% to 15% of such capacity, modules were imported before the BCD imposition,” said Manish Gupta, senior director at CRISIL Ratings. “Hence treating BCD as a ‘change in law’ event will benefit the remaining capacity of up to 6 GW, making the projects economically viable.”
The projects were bid at tariffs ranging from INR 1.99 ($0.024)/kWh to INR 2.92/kWh, with only 20% of the projects being at a tariff of more than INR 2.55/kWh. Thus the increased tariff post-pass-through is expected to be in the range of INR 3/kWh to 3.2/kWh, keeping them cost-competitive compared to the average power procurement cost for discoms in India.
“Tariff pass-through remains only a partial relief as returns for these projects will remain weaker than envisaged at the time of bidding, as module prices have risen by 50% since then,” said Ankit Hakhu, director of CRISIL Ratings. “This is in contrast to the industry expectation of softening prices, in line with past trends, and was not budgeted in tariffs while bidding.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/16/sun-tracking-floating-solar-islands-from-portugal/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INSTALLATIONS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,NETHERLANDS,PORTUGAL,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"NOVEMBER 16, 2022",Sun-tracking floating solar islands from Portugal,"Solaris Float has developed a floating solar solution with single- or dual-axis tracking. The floating island slowly rotates around a central point, powered by electric engines that reportedly consume less than 0.5% of the energy produced. The system rotates in one direction during the day, tracking the sun, and then rotates in the opposite direction during the night, to return to its original position.
The company claims that the Protevs solution produces up to 40% more electricity than floating fixed-tilt systems. This includes a production increase of around 15% due to temperature cooling resulting from the proximity to water.
The company installed its first pilot project in 2020 on Oostvoornse Meer, which is a lake near Maasvlakte, in the Netherlands. The 50.7 kWp installation includes 130 PV modules on a single-axis tracker. The project is part of a research initiative launched by a consortium led by Dutch research organization TNO, which aims to install 2 GW of floating solar in the Netherlands by 2023.
Solaris Float offers two versions of the Protevs, which can be adapted to different projects. The Protevs + is a floating island featuring 180 modules with dual-axis tracking. It has a diameter of 38 meters and occupies an area of 1,444 square meters. The solution has an installed capacity of 73 kWp with 370 W modules. Each of the panels can move vertically.
The Protevs Single360 is a single-axis solution, with PV modules mounted on a fixed slope of 10 degrees. The floating island is composed of 360 modules, with an installed capacity of 147 kWp for 410 W panels.
The Protevs solutions are modular, detachable and scalable, as the floating islands can be merged to form a floating solar farm, according to the company. A farm of seven floating islands would reportedly have an installed capacity of 1 MW, producing 2 GW/year of electricity under normal conditions.
The floating system was designed for use in relatively calm waters, such as lakes and reservoirs. To accommodate changes in water level, the island is secured in place by an outer ring attached with cables and anchors so that it can move up and down up to 20 or 30 meters. It is also designed to resist a wide variety of environmental conditions, such as salt water and waves up to one meter high. It is made of 100% recycled materials which can be recycled after the project’s lifetime.
The technology was invented by Portuguese scientists at the INEGI investigation center in Porto, Portugal.

“The concept of a phase heterojunction for photovoltaics could be applicable to different classes of polymorphic materials, which means such devices may find applications in many different areas,” researcher Yana Vaynzof told pv magazine. “Phase heterojunctions can be deposited on solid substrates for long term PV installations, but can also be made on flexible substrates for portable electronics or Internet-of-Things applications.”
“The advantage of the phase heterojunction concept is that a single material is used on both sides of the junction, just in a different crystalline phase,” she continued. “This eliminates the need for doping and prevents the negative impact of ion migration. Such an approach demonstrates that crystalline engineering can lead to efficient heterojunction solar cells from a single material without the need for doping or other means to control their properties.”
Vaynzof noted that the novelty of the new approach lies in the realization of a junction based on the combination of two components with different optoelectronic properties. The scientists chose the β- and γ-phases of a perovskite material known as CsPbI3 for the two polymorphs.
“Our choice of the β-CsPbI3 and γ-CsPbI3 phases for the demonstration of the PHJ concept was motivated by their relatively low-temperature processing, unlike the α-CsPbI3 that requires annealing at less than 300 C,” they explained. “Considering that solution processing of all polymorphs of CsPbI3 requires the use of the same type of polar solvent38, we utilized a hybrid deposition approach that combines both solution processing and thermal evaporation.”
The team used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to characterize the microstructure of the deposited layers and their surface. It found that the solution-processed β-CsPbI3 shows uniform, large grain size with an average diameter of around 300 nm. They also found that the energy bandgap of the γ- and β-CsPbI3 was 1.74 eV and 1.69 eV, respectively.
“Their two slightly different bandgaps result in the absorbance spectra of the PHJ samples displaying features originating from both phases,” they said, adding that their optimal thickness is between 500 nm and 370 nm.
The researchers said the cell configuration offers an increase in all photovoltaic parameters. It has a power conversion efficiency of 20.17% and a maximum fill factor of 84.17%.
“Advanced spectroscopic analysis revealed that this improvement in performance is associated with increased light absorption and the formation of an advantageous energetic alignment between the two phases,” said Vaynzof.
The academics presented the new cell technology in “Perovskite phase heterojunction solar cells,” which was recently published in Nature Energy.
“The approach demonstrated here offers new possibilities for the development of photovoltaic devices based on polymorphic materials,” they said.

Radguard uses a lamp to illuminate a pyranometer or PV reference cell for about 45 minutes at night. The lamp is protected from soiling by a 25-cm collimator. The scientists said this is crucial for the correct functioning of the device, as well as the fixed position of the lamp.
“By comparing the irradiance measured at night with that of another night when the sensor was clean, the soiling loss can be derived,” the scientists said. “Several 45-minute long measurements are combined to detect erroneous soiling measurements caused by dew, rain droplets on the radiometer, or other effects that might only be present in some of the various measurements.”
They placed the RS2600 pocket lamp on one end of a 90-degree angle structure. On the other side of the structure, they used a corresponding sensor, a CM11 pyranometer, and an NES SOZ-03 reference cell with textured cover glass. They also used a Campbell CR1000 data-logger to collect data on the reference cell's short-circuit current and the pyranometer's voltage.
“The batteries of the lamp are replaced by a power supply that is controlled with a common time controller that switches on the lamp during one or more 45-minute intervals at night,” said the academics.
The group validated the new technique in four-month testing held in outdoor conditions, which it claims showed an accuracy that is close to that of the reference method, which however includes the daily cleaning of the reference devices.
“The measured soiling losses were compared to soiling losses derived by comparing the test radiometer to a clean device of the same model,” the scientists said. “The deviations between the data sets were found to be below the expected uncertainty of the reference data with low biases of <0.3%.”
They described the new technique in “Autonomous measurement system for photovoltaic and radiometer soiling losses,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. The research team includes academics from Sweden's DLR Remote Sensing Data Center, Spain's CIEMAT Plataforma Solar de Almería, and Germany's DLR Institute of Remote Sensing Technology.
“In the future, the method will be tested at further sites and in longer measurement campaigns that are now under preparation,” they concluded.

CKW, a unit of Swiss utility Axpo, has installed PV modules in the dish of a disused satellite operated by Leuk TDC in Leuk, Switzerland.
Satellite dishes are idea for solar because they can be flexibly aligned to the sun. In addition, hardly any snow sticks to the modules. The facility in Leuk is 1,000 meters above sea level, and thus above the fog line. This ensures higher yields, even in winter.
The solar system in the satellite dish will supply around 110,000 kWh of electricity per year. Another system on the roof of the data center will supply an additional 550,000 kWh per year.
Leuk TDC wants to equip two more satellite dishes with solar. It has already obtained a building permit for one of them, and installation is set to begin next spring. The company aims to run its data centers almost entirely on renewable energy in the future, including hydropower.
CKW installed the systems under a contracting model, so Leuk TDC will receive the electricity for a fixed contract period at a fixed price. CKW also handles maintenance. At the end of the contract period, the plant will belong to Leuk TDC. Under this model, the company is shielded from price fluctuations in the electricity markets, without having to invest in its own projects.
There is enormous untapped potential in the solar sector in Switzerland, particularly with ground-mounted systems in mountainous regions. “We also want to increasingly implement large-scale systems in the alpine area, because they are more efficient and can even produce more electricity in winter than in summer,” says CKW CEO Martin Schwab.

Velux Group, a Danish manufacturer specializing in roof windows, has commissioned Germany’s BayWa r.e. to build two solar projects to power its operations in Europe.
The installations will be developed in the Spanish districts of Seville and Granada, with respective capacities of 60 MWp and 56 MW. BayWa has told pv magazine that one of them, the Alhendín solar park, will include its first agricultural PV installation in Spain. About 10% of the project will be an agrivoltaics system, which makes the deal between BayWa and Velux the first agrivoltaics PPA in Europe.
According to BayWa, the installation will have rows of panels spaced more widely than usual, to allow passage of agricultural machinery and the cultivation of cereals. In addition, the rainwater that falls on the modules will be collected and used for irrigation.
In 2021, the company advanced plans to build agrivoltaics and floating PV projects in Spain. It also said it will partner with the  Autonomous University of Madrid and the University of Córdoba to set up an interdisciplinary research team. “Their conclusions will serve as the basis for establishing a comprehensive strategy tailored to the parks,” the company said, without providing additional details.

X-Elio has flicked the switch on is first major project in Australia and its largest to date, with the Spain-based solar developer confirming that the 200 MW Blue Grass Solar Farm near the town of Chinchilla, Queensland, is now online.
Belinda Fan, X-Elio’s country manager in Australia, said the completion of the project strengthens the company’s position in the Australian market. She said it also supports the state government’s recently announced renewable energy targets to generate 70% of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2032, and 80% by 2035.
“The Blue Grass Solar Farm is among Queensland’s 50 large-scale renewable projects, coming online at an opportune time to help support the state government’s clean energy ambitions,” she said. “We’d like to think of this project as a small but important step in the state’s march to net zero.”
The 200 MW solar plant, located 14 kilometers west of Chinchilla in the planned Darling Downs Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), is expected to deliver an estimated 420 GWh of 100% renewable energy per year. That is enough to power 80,000 homes and offset approximately 320,000 tons of CO2 emissions.
The electricity generated at the facility will be supplied to the National Electricity Market (NEM) through the existing 132 kV Chinchilla-Columboola transmission line, which is operated by Queensland’s transmission network provider, Powerlink.
The project is supported by power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Queensland government-owned energy generator Stanwell, Australian electricity retailer ZEN Energy, and US software company Salesforce. Stanwell has signed an agreement with X-Elio for 49 MW offtake from the Blue Grass solar farm.
Salesforce has signed an agreement for 25% of the output of the facility – more than enough renewable energy to match its electricity use for its entire Australian operations. The PPA is its first international renewable energy offtake agreement and Salesforce Australia and New Zealand CEO Pip Marlow said the launch of the Blue Grass Solar Farm is a milestone moment in the company’s sustainability journey,
“Salesforce has net-zero residual emissions and reached 100% renewable energy for its global operations in 2021,” she said. “Projects like Blue Grass Solar Farm are critical to our vision for a net-zero world.”
X-Elio Chief Executive Officer Lluis Noguera said the Blue Grass Solar Farm marks the opening phase of the company’s long-term interest in the Australian market where it continues to pursue new growth opportunities.
“Australia is a key strategic market for X-Elio and our Blue Grass Solar Farm will spearhead our continued expansion along Australia’s east coast, with additional projects planned for New South Wales and Victoria,” he said.
X-Elio has announced plans to build a 300 MW solar farm and battery energy storage system near Wagga Wagga, New South Wales. The 120 MW Forest Glen and 80 MW Wunghnu solar farms in New South Wales and Victoria, respectively, are also part of the more than 500 MW of projects X-Elio has in development in Australia.

Amptricity has announced what it says is the first solid-state battery for home energy storage. The company plans to deliver its first solid-state energy storage systems of up to 4 GWh or up to 400,000 homes within the next 30 months. Commercial 1 MWh demo units are available now to select customers, with an announcement coming in the next few weeks on full commercial production.
The company, which was founded in 2020 and based in Florida, plans to build its first US manufacturing facility by 2024. The company expects to begin producing 4 GW per year in 2024 and then ramp up to 16 GW. It is reviewing manufacturing site locations in Texas, Arkansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, Arizona and Tennessee.
Amptricity reports that its next-generation battery technology represents eight-hour discharge, simultaneous charging and discharging, no thermal runoff, zero toxicity, 100% recyclable, fully functional in extreme cold and hot temperatures, and high energy storage efficiency with an annual retention rate of more than 96%. Its proprietary solid-state batteries include a cell capacity above 500 Ah (amp-hour) up to 3,000 Ah with an 11,000-deep discharge cycle.
The company says its home energy storage systems create greater safety and longevity, while the average residential systems use lithium-ion batteries, which pose a fire risk. Furthermore, its battery lifespan is three times longer than current lithium-ion technologies, the company reports.
“Solar PV homeowners will love our solid state energy storage systems because they offer superior performance and are non-explosive, non-flammable, non-toxic, and 100% recyclable. For example, last year in Texas, homeowners suffered blackouts and fatalities from a winter storm due to the power grid’s fragility,” said Damir Perge, CEO and co-founder of Amptricity. “With Amptricity’s solid state technology, homeowners can store energy for backup power – whether they have solar PVs or not.”
Residential energy storage systems of 12 kWh to 48 kWh and commercial systems from 60 kWh to 80 kWh are available for preorder on Amptricity’s website.
