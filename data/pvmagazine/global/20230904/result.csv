Thoughtful planning of solar project siting can save useful land, protecting farmlands, habitats, and other land uses. A report from Environment America based on analysis from Georgia-based nonprofit The Ray shows that the counties of Los Angeles, Ventura, and San Diego in California have 4,800 acres of suitable solar project space alongside its highways and rights-of-way.
These spaces are advantageously located alongside infrastructure and are otherwise unused. The sites could host over 960 MW of solar capacity, generating 1,960 GWh per year. This is roughly equivalent to the electricity demand of 270,000 California homes.
“California can utilize the results of our solar analysis tool to prioritize the most promising spaces for solar panels in the state’s vast rights-of-way, and generate a wealth of clean electricity in the process,” said David Peters, western regional manager for The Ray.
California needs to triple its solar power capacity to meet its 100% clean energy requirement, according to the California Energy Commission. Putting solar panels alongside already-developed highways reduces the need for large utility-scale projects that can harm environmentally sensitive areas such as California’s deserts, said Environment California.
Environmentally sensitive or protected lands, areas within roadway clear zones, and areas in close proximity to pipelines, transmission lines, and other infrastructure were omitted from the report as “suitable” locations alongside highways.
Past solar highway projects have shown promise across the country, even in northern or rainy climates. The nation’s first right-of-way solar project was installed in 2008 just outside of Portland, Oregon. In 2012, a second project was added, adding 1.75 MW of solar capacity.
In Georgia, a segment of highway near LaGrange, Georgia known as The Ray Highway, is home to a 5-acre 1 MW solar array commercialized in February 2022 on otherwise underutilized state-owned land.
And in Maine, the state’s Department of Transportation (DOT) completed three projects in June 2023, adding 8.5 MW of capacity. The projects power the state’s Capitol building complex and additional facilities. The projects are expected to save the state $7.2 million over the next 20 years on electricity costs. In addition to the solar deployment, Maine DOT planted pollinator-friendly plants in the ground surrounding the panels.
California targets 100% emissions free electricity by 2045. The three counties in the report, along with California’s 55 other counties have an opportunity to move towards this goal while preserving land.
“This new analysis makes a strong case for utilizing land along California’s highways to generate clean energy,” said state Sen. Josh Becker. “If just three counties have this much solar potential alongside their highways, imagine our entire state’s potential. Let’s make better use of the available roadside land at our disposal.”

Uniper has announced plans to build two solar power plants with a combined capacity of 317 MW near its Energy Transformation Hub in Lower Saxony, Germany. The plants will be designed with capacities of 300 MW and 17 MW, and will supply electricity to a planned green hydrogen facility at the hub.
The German energy company has also said that the hydrogen will be stored in dedicated caverns at the same location.
“The project received the development decision from the municipality of Elsfleth on Aug. 18, 2023, which formally marks the beginning of the urban land use plan process,” the company said in reference to the largest project, which will be located in Elsfleth. “The necessary legal framework for the project will be created by drawing up a development plan and amending the land use plan.”
Uniper said the 17 MW project will be located on the site of an ash dump for the Wilhelmshaven coal-fired power plant. It is expected to be connected to existing local grid infrastructure.
“Our multi-gigawatt pipeline of renewables projects is growing steadily, already 1.5 GW are under development across various European markets,” said Jörg Lennertz, the CEO of Uniper Renewables.

Italy added approximately 2.3 GW of new PV systems in the first half of 2023, up about 12% from the same period in 2022. The country reached about 27.4 GW of cumulative installed PV capacity at the end of June 2023.
About 47% of the power added in the first half of this year originates from residential installations, with recent growth driven by the commercial and industrial sector (C&I) and utility-scale projects over 1 MW in size.
“The connected power in these sectors in Q2 23 recorded an increase of 49% for the first case and 89% in the second, compared to the first quarter of this year,” said Italia Solare.
In the second quarter of 2023, connections of plants exceeding 10 MW, which had been stagnant since July 2022, resumed. Specifically, two 10 MW plants in Piedmont and Puglia, and a 36 MW facility in Sardinia saw new connections.
Conversely, the residential sector experienced a slight decline in new installations, dropping from 569 MW in the first quarter of 2023 to 528 MW in the second quarter, due to the expiration of the superbonus.
The regions with the highest share of total new capacity additions include Lombardia with 429 MW, Veneto with 353 MW, and Emilia Romagna with 235 MW.
Lombardy maintains its first-place position with 3.58 GW of cumulative power, widening the gap with Puglia, which has 3.18 GW of connected PV. In the first half of the year, Lombardy led in connected power with 429 MW, followed by Veneto with 353 MW, and Emilia Romagna with 235 MW.

The project is part of the Upscaling Renewable Energy Sector Project, which aims to deploy 40.5 MW of solar and wind capacity in the country’s Altai-Uliastai regions.
The $66.2 million initiative also includes another 10 MW of solar in the Khövsgöl Aimag region in northern Mongolia, a 500 kW solar-wind hybrid project with storage in Altai County, a 10 MW wind project in Umunogovi, and a 5 MW wind farm in Telmen.
The nation’s total theoretical power generation capacity is 1,158 MW, according to the ADB. However, only 969 MW of that appears to be online due to aging, coal-based conventional power plants. The country imports a large portion of its power from neighboring countries.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Mongolia had an installed PV capacity of around 95 MW at the end of 2022.

ClearVue said it has shown that its second-generation power-generating solar windows can be mass produced on unmodified manufacturing lines, avoiding the need for glass manufacturers to make costly and time-consuming changes to its industry-standard facilities.
The Perth-based company said its licensed manufacturer in China had conducted a commercial production run on a standard manufacturing line with continuous production of 80 integrated glazing units (IGUs). Adding ClearVue’s components to produce a fully assembled and sealed IGU increased the production cycle time by only five minutes.
ClearVue Chief Executive Offer Martin Deil said the production run was a “very important milestone,” proving that the company’s second-generation IGUs can be mass produced by glazing manufacturers globally without the need for production line change.
“We now have proven ability to scale our innovative smart building solutions,” he said. “Our ability to mass produce the second-generation IGUs confirms the commercial viability of our product for both large commercial and small-scale bespoke products.”
Deil said eliminating the need for production line changes will allow manufacturers to lower their costs and increase their production outputs and manufacturing plant capability, “leading to lower cost products for end-customers.”
ClearVue has developed specialized glass technologies that preserve glass transparency while generating electricity. The IGUs feature PV cells around the edges of each unit. The units incorporate a nanoparticle interlayer and spectral-selective coating on the rear external surface which allow much of the light to pass through but redirects infrared and UV light to the edge of the IGU where it is harvested by solar cells.
The company said its second-generation IGUs deliver enhanced efficiency – averaging about 100 w peak per square metre over an entire facade – and a lower average cost per watt. The new design also provides reductions in the thickness and weight of the units while new electrical connection elements simplify the assembly and fabrication process.
ClearVue said production of the second-generation IGUs was initially tested at a smaller factory in Singapore with the company saying the time required to fabricate and assemble them was about 90% less than its original IGUs.
Deil said he expects the latest commercial-scale production run will assist ClearVue as it looks to expand its manufacturing capabilities, adding the company is currently in discussions with “multiple manufacturing license partners around the world.”

The Italy-based cable manufacturer said the new transmission line will begin operating by the end of this year and will operate at 525 kV DC.
The project is a joint venture between the grid operators of the two countries – National Grid and Energinet. Its cables cross through four exclusive economic zones in Dutch, German, Danish and British waters.
“Each territory has its own legislation and stakeholders. The cabling crosses more than 40 other lines, such as gas and electricity connections,” Prysmian said in a statement.
Prysmian secured a €700 million ($755.8 million) cable installation contract for the GBP 1.7 billion ($2.14 billion) project in August 2019.
“The contract included the turn-key design, manufacture and installation of the world’s longest interconnector covering all the 1,250 km of cables for the submarine route and approximately 135 km of land cables on the UK side, for the four lots awarded to Prysmian out of a total of five lots,” it said.
Viking Link is National Grid’s sixth interconnector. The company already has five operational transmission lines connecting the United Kingdom with France (IFA and IFA2), the Netherlands (BritNed), Belgium (Nemo Link), and Norway (North Sea Link).

“In our work, we investigated the potential of such a laser-annealing strategy specifically for selenium thin-film solar cells, and we report a new world record fill factor, a new world record ideality factor, and state-of-the-art device performance,” the research's lead author, Rasmus Nielsen, told pv magazine. “Moreover, the laser-annealing strategy enables us to control the morphology of the photoabsorber to an incredible extent.”
The proposed laser-annealing strategy consists of illuminating the selenium absorber through a semitransparent substrate, which the researchers said results in negligible surface roughness and larger grains. “The crystallization technique is particularly interesting, as it enables crystallizing the selenium absorber without heating up the substrate,” Nielsen also explained.
The group built the cell with a soda-lime glass substrate, a tin oxide (FTO) layer, an electron transport layer made of titanium oxide (TiO2), a selenium absorber, a molybdenum oxide (MoOx) layer, and a gold (Au) metal contact. The TiO2 thin film was formed by sputtering metallic Ti in a reactive atmosphere with an elevated substrate temperature of 400 C. The cell was then annealed at 500  C for 1 h under high vacuum.
“Laser-annealing of the amorphous selenium thin-film was performed through the substrate,” the academics explained. “Using this ‘superstrate' laser-annealing strategy, the optical energy is predominantly absorbed in the vicinity of the carrier separating junction
instead of the open surface from where selenium can re-evaporate away.”
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 5.0% and a record fill factor of 63.7%. The device also reached a record ideality factor value of n = 1.37. The ideality factor indicates the degree to which a solar cell resembles the characteristics of an ideal diode.
“It is worth noting that this fill factor value is the highest reported among selenium solar cells and that the fill factors of the laser-annealed samples reproducibly outperform those of the thermally annealed control samples, regardless of the range of laser doses investigated,” the scientists said. “The improved fill factor could be attributed to the more optimally aligned crystal grains and the flat surface morphology.”
The solar cell is described in the paper “Laser-Annealing and Solid-Phase Epitaxy of Selenium Thin-Film Solar Cells,” published in ACS Publications.
The same research group presented in December a 0.30 cm2 selenium solar cell with a world record open-circuit voltage of 0.99 V.

In such buildings, the total sum of annual energy use is approximately equal to the total sum of the renewable energy produced on-site. “Our system has been designed to meet all the heating, cooling, domestic hot water, and electricity demand of a ZEB,” the research's corresponding author, Sangmu Bae, told pv magazine.
The scientists explained that the proposed system configuration offers more advantages compared to integrated PVT ground source heat pumps (GSHP), which have so far had limited success in real applications in urban areas due to the complex installation process and high initial costs.
The system consists of a PVT module, an ASHP, a heat storage tank with a volume of 0.3 m3, a fan coil unit (FCU), three circulating pumps, and three-way valves.
The 1.012 m × 1.972 m PVT panel is based on main and capillary pipes of diameters of 0.015 m and 0.008 m, respectively, which the academics said are easy to fabricate and weld. “The pipes were fully clamped and attached through the aluminum jig and plate, and the groove in the plate had available spaces considering the expansion of the pipe,” they explained.

The module achieves thermal and electric efficiencies of 59.7% and 16.1%, as well as heating and cooling capacities equal to 7.55 kW and 11.36 kW, respectively.
The Korean group evaluated the heating and cooling performance of the PVT–ASHP system in a small scale office building located in Busan and compared it with that of a PVT-GSHP. “The mock-up test room included a monitoring room,” it said. “The air-conditioning areas of the office and the monitoring rooms were equal to 85.8 m2 and 22.1 m2, respectively.”
During the testing period, the system reached a thermal efficiency of 18.1% and an output of 37 kWh. It also achieved electrical efficiency of 11.4% on a winter day and 10.2% on a summer day. The electrical output was 8.84 kWh and 12.9 kWh, respectively.
“The electrical efficiency was lower than on a representative winter day,” the scientists further explained. “However, the PVT module could generate more electrical power owing to the higher total solar radiation and longer sunlight hours.”
The heat pump also achieved an average heating and cooling coefficient of performance (COP) of 3.54 and 3.31, respectively. The PVT module was able to improve the performance of the heat pump by up to 52% compared to an ASHP system without PVT energy.
“The PVT module could offset approximately 18% and 27% of the total power consumption of the PVT–ASHP system during the
winter and summer seasons, respectively,” the scientists said, adding that the proposed system is also around 44% cheaper than a PVT-GSHP.
They presented the system in the study “Experimental analysis of an integrated system using photovoltaic–thermal and air source heat pump for real applications,” published in Renewable Energy.
