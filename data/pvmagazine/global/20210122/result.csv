Under the terms of the agreement, Baotou Hongyuan will sell approximately 882 million mono-crystalline wafers to Chint for an estimated amount of more than RMB 4 billion ($634 million), according to the latest average selling price indicated by Taiwanese market research company PV Infolink. The two companies agreed on the financial terms of the deal for 2021, while for the following two years the terms will be negotiated at the end of the year.
China National Nuclear Corp. (CNNC), one of China's largest state-owned energy groups, announced on Wednesday that Longi, Trina and Risen were selected as preferred module providers for its most recent procurement round. CNNC held 11 different tenders for a total solar module capacity of 1.31 GW. Longi secured the largest amount of capacity, 917.3 MW, while Trina and Risen were awarded the remaining share.
The government of Jianhu County, in Jiangsu Province, has signed an agreement with Jiangsu Lushan New Material, a unit of Guangzhou Lushan New Material Group, a provider of functional polymer adhesive materials, for the construction of a 20 GW EVA factory relying on 18 production lines. Furthermore, the county government has signed a similar agreement with Jiangsu Runda PV Co., Ltd to build a 3.5 GW panel manufacturing facility at an undisclosed location in the region. 
Polysilicon manufacturer GCL-Poly placed 3.9 billion shares at HK$1.08 ($0.14) per share to raise a net HK$4.15 billion ($535 million) as it tries to postpone settlement of $500 million worth of senior notes due to expire in eight days’ time. Note holders have been asked to indicate whether they would swap the notes for new three-year investments by Tuesday. The shares placed yesterday amounted to 15.57% of the GCL-Poly Energy Holdings business.
Glass maker Flat Glass Group yesterday announced a RMB 8.91 billion ($1.38 billion), three-year deal to supply 34 GW/234 million square meters of solar module glass to Chinese manufacturer Risen, with the contract to run until the end of 2023. The unit sale price will be negotiated on an ongoing basis “by both parties through friendly consultation on a win-win basis with reference to prevailing market prices,” Flat Glass told the Hong Kong Stock Exchange yesterday.
Polysilicon producer Xinte also announced a big contract after signing a five-year deal to supply 70,350 tons of poly to PV appliance maker Wuxi Shangji Automation from this month until December 2025. Based on the latest polysilicon price listed by Taiwanese market research company PV Infolink, the deal would be worth RMB 6.05 billion, Xinte told the Hong Kong exchange yesterday.
Jetion Solar yesterday announced it had supplied 100 MW of modules to a solar project in Shaanxi province. The solar manufacturer said more than 223,000 of its JT SSh (B) 445/450 W, monocrystalline, dual glass modules were shipped in the final three months of last year. Developer Sungrow connected the plant to the grid on December 29.

In Western Australia (WA), Aggreko installed one of Australia's largest microgrids, 7.7 MWp of modular solar generation. However, while the Granny Smith gold mine is remote by any standard, it is not quite as remote, or remote in the same way, as the Salares Norte open pit mine in Chile which sits at an altitude of 4,500 meters in the Andes, 190 kilometers from the nearest town. 
However, the significant challenge of building a solar PV installation at a remote high-altitude location has not fazed Aggreko. The British-based modular solar company signed a 10-year contract with Gold Fields to provide a 25.9 MW hybrid solar and thermal power modular solution across the mine's five distribution points. 
Pablo Varela, managing director of Aggreko LATAM, told pv magazine that the Salares Norte site posed a unique challenge compared to the Granny Smith project. To combat the extreme winds and ensure consistency of power across all five delivery points, “Aggreko has developed high-altitude performance diesel gensets and Solar Power units specifically designed to meet the extreme wind, snow, and altitude conditions at the site — adaptations which were not required at the Granny Smith site.” 
Of course, it should be pointed out that the Granny Smith hybrid was of solar and gas with integrated battery storage while the Salares Norte project comprises a hybrid of solar and diesel. 
Each diesel gensets can deliver 772 kW and incorporate Spinning Reserve and Cold Reserve units to manage demand peaks after integration with 9.9 MW of solar. The solar array, capable of delivering 18 GWh of renewable energy annually, will sit in a fixed dome structure with East-West exposure and be reinforced to withstand battering winds. “We have chosen to implement fixed-tilt solar units rather than tracker solutions. This is to ensure the longevity and reliability of the PV units,” said Varela. 
“Our engineers are used to developing solutions which can run efficiently in even the most challenging of climate conditions.” And it is no surprise that such challenging climatic conditions also make the site remote. Due to this isolation the reliability of the system is integral. 
According to Varela, not only will the carefully calibrated fuel mix help to ensure reliability, “but also by making the decision to have a team of engineers based at the mine once it is operational. Although we have the capability to monitor and carry out O&M remotely, the extreme conditions can make access a challenge so we want to mitigate this risk where we can.” 
The mine, as previously stated, is spread across five delivery sites, each cradled in mountainous nooks and crannies. “The site is restricted in terms of the amount of space it has,” continued Varela, “which means our engineering team had to be quite creative. Our solution was to split the power supply over three sites, rather than trying to fit it all into one restricted space.” 

On completion, Aggreko estimates the hybrid system will save Gold Fields $7.4 million in energy over the decade and a further $1.1 million in carbon tax offset. 
Moreover, as a modular rental installation, now becoming a very attractive option for remote mine sites, Gold Fields doesn't have to fret about a single significant investment but rather a consolidated CAPEX outlay. 
The Salares Norte solar hybrid project will be Aggreko's largest solar installation in Latin America to date. Varela expects the site to be operational in Q2/Q3 2022. Aggreko is keen to use the Salares Norte project as a springboard for its Latin American ambitions. “We have a number of exciting projects in the region covering a broad span of applications, technologies and geographies,” Varela said. “From the rainforest to the Argentinian Pampa, from landfill gas to remote battery storage, we deliver power wherever it's needed.”

A new report demonstrates renewables coupled with battery storage as a technically and financially viable option to building new coal plants in Tamil Nadu.  
The report finds the levelized cost of electricity generation for a hypothetical hybrid solar-wind-lithium-ion battery storage system for the state to be INR 4.97/kWh ($0.068/kWh) in 2021, which falls to INR 3.4/kWh by 2030. In comparison, the cost of electricity produced from new coal power plants in Tamil Nadu is between INR 4.5-6/kWh.
The report was prepared by JMK Research and Climate Trends based on the modeling of such a hybrid system and the  technical and commercial analysis. For the study, the hybrid system was designed for 1 GW of solar and wind capacity in 2021 with two hours of battery backup, which was increased stepwise over 10 years to a four-hour backup by 2030. 
“Our analysis found that the cost of hybrid RE with battery storage system is at parity with new coal power plants in Tamil Nadu. Moreover, in 10 years’ time, incremental capacity addition would further drive down the cost by over 31%,” said Jyoti Gulia, founder of JMK Research and Analysis. 
The research further highlighted that adding lithium-based battery storage would help reduce the curtailment of renewable energy in the state.

To do this, the scientists want to combine a high-performance vanadium redox flow battery with a supercapacitor.
The EU is funding HyFlow with €4 million until 2023. The project is coordinated by the Landshut University of Applied Sciences. Also taking part in the endeavor are the Fraunhofer Institute for Chemical Technology ICT, the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and the Bavarian Research Alliance.
“A redox-flow battery has a large storage capacity, but can only be charged and discharged slowly,” explained Karl-Heinz Pettinger, scientific director of the Energy Technology Center at Landshut University of Applied Sciences and coordinator of the project. “The supercapacitor, on the other hand, has short charging times with a low energy density. Hybridization is intended to create an energy storage system that combines the advantages of both systems: high storage capacity and high performance.”
The hybrid system should be able to flexibly balance the electricity and energy requirements in the event of critical grid conditions such as high load or generation peaks — whether for seconds or entire days.
The hybrid concept is also intended to ensure a longer service life, a high degree of adaptability and potentially lower costs. An innovative management system uses computer analysis and control algorithms to ensure a high level of control and flexibility. The researchers said they were paying particular attention to sustainability and that a recycling concept was also being developed.
The idea for the project arose in 2019 on the fringes of a conference organized by the FSTORE research platform, where the first contacts to possible partners were made.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/22/bangladesh-joins-hydrogen-energy-race/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,ASIA,BANGLADESH",SYFUL ISLAM,"JANUARY 22, 2021",Bangladesh joins hydrogen energy race,"Bangladesh has joined the hydrogen energy race by setting up of a research centre and a pilot processing plant. The project is part of the government’s larger effort to diversify the country’s energy mix, which is still largely dependent on gas and coal.
Hydrogen is currently being produced at the pilot plant by using waste and biomass as feedstock. The use of water as a raw material will begin soon with the installation of another processing plant.
Following the installation of the pilot plant, the Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (BCSIR) has started training scientists to advance the effort towards setting up of a full-fledged Hydrogen Energy Laboratory as part of the project.
The BCSIR said it was working to start production of hydrogen as an alternative energy source in Bangladesh and taking into consideration the availability of abundant water resources in the country.
As renewable energy, hydrogen will help Bangladesh transition from costly gas and polluting coal to clean energy alongside renewables power. The expansion of the technology will accelerate the energy efficiency and the government’s target to generate 10% of the country's electricity from renewables, the BCSIR said in a Jan. 20 press release.
The project is aimed at research, quality control related to hydrogen production, storage, supply and infrastructure development as well as at providing services in the form of a national level reference center.
“We do not have our own fuel. We are totally import dependent for fuel. The hydro energy is a blessing for us,” Abdus Salam, project director and senior principal engineer at BCSIR, told pv magazine. “We have no dearth of water,” he said, adding that even the recycled waste water and sea water could be used for producing hydro energy.
As part of the ongoing project, a hydrogen fueling station will be set up alongside the procurement of a fuel cell vehicle that also runs on electricity, Salam added.
“Hydrogen fuel will boost energy security, energy reserves and the national economy,” he stressed. “Energy from fossils and renewable sources is stored in the form of hydrogen and later it can be used by converting it into fuel and different energy if required.”
The fuel value of hydrogen (142 kJ/g) is three times greater than traditional fuel and has no harmful effects on the environment, the BCSIR added.
About 33.33 kWh energy is generated from 1 kg of hydrogen fuel, but only 12 kWh/kg and 14.7 kWh/kg from petrol and compressed natural gas (CNG), respectively. Fuel cell cars run 100 to 131 km using 1 kg of hydrogen, whereas a traditional car runs 16 km using a kg of petrol.
Salam is hopeful that hydrogen fuel can be made available for industrial and vehicular use by 2030 to 2041.

The PV Mitra solar facility will be part of a renewable energy complex that the company has planned for the area and is also part of the ORLEN2030 strategy aimed at bringing its total renewable energy capacity to 2 GW by the end of the decade.
The oil company is currently filing the applications for all relevant building and grid connection permits, which it expects to obtain by the end of the year. The solar park is expected to be connected to the grid infrastructure of a coal power plant located nearby and will be located on land owned by Orlen, which considerably reduces the project costs. The company has not provided details on the sale of the electricity produced by the facility.
The Adamów renewable energy complex is already hosting a 30 MW wind power plant that has been operational since July and is also preparing to host another 20 MW solar project called PV Gryf.
Orlen currently owns and operates clean energy assets totalling 450 MW. Its oil business spans across Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, the Baltic states, and Canada.

The method is based on the use of an open-ended channel, partly filled with an isotropic porous material, with constant thermo-physical properties attached to the backside of the panels.
“The main purpose of using porous material is to extend the heat transfer area by increasing the solid-fluid interaction,” researcher Ali Mahmoud Khlefat told pv magazine. “Any highly conductive material such as copper and aluminum or alloy can be utilized in this regard keeping in mind that the efficiency enhancement would justify the added cost.”
The scientists used a discrete ordinates (DO) model, which facilitates the modeling of a solid zone with adjacent fluid or solid zones on either side as a semi-transparent medium. They chose this method to simulate the radiative heat transfer from the solar radiation, the heat transfer within the PV panel layers, and inside the channel.
With this model, the radiative transfer equation (RTE) – a five-dimensional integro-differential equation with three spatial and two-directional coordinates – was transformed into a transport equation for radiation intensity in the spatial coordinates.
“Air was a nonparticipating media in the radiation process and all other materials used in this study were gray-diffusive,” the researchers explained. “Gray materials are materials that have constant optical properties, i.e. the emissivity and absorptivity are independent of the wavelength of the incident solar irradiance.”
The validation of the simulation was based on a 2007 study and assumed that the panel was tilted at 45 degrees. It was performed with the date, time, longitudes, and latitudes of Bangkok, on a PV panel consisting of a glass cover, a PV layer, a Tedlar layer, and a flow porous layer. The module was exposed to constant heat fluctuations and its temperature and that of the Tedlar layer were assumed to be uniform.
“The PV panel type assumed in the study was the monocrystalline module JKM360M-72 from Chinese manufacturer Jinko with a maximum conversion efficiency of 18.55% and a temperature correction coefficient f 0.0045 K-1, under standard test conditions,” Khlefat said.
The analysis considered a range of different factors, including the convective coefficient, which is defined as the ratio of natural to forced convection. The scientists also looked at the Darcy number, which represents the relative effect of the permeability of a medium versus its cross-sectional area, and the inclination angle of the PV module. In addition, they considered the thickness ratios of the porous material, the conversion efficiency of the solar module, and the internal emissivity of the duct base material on the average Nusselt number. The Nusselt number is the ratio of convective heat transfer to conductive heat transfer at a boundary in a fluid.
“It has been proven that the heat transfer from the backside of the PV panel was significantly increased by the proposed system,” the academics said. “The considerable enhancement in heat transfer from the PV panel was achieved because of the high kinetic energy that concurred with high values of the convective coefficient.”
The scientists found that increases in efficiency were proportional to the thickness ratios.
“A porous thickness ratio (SP/S = 0.7) was considered in the following analysis, to compromise between material cost and performance enhancement,” they said. “Moreover, several cases were studied to achieve the optimum configuration to dissipate the heat from the PV panel to the environment.”
The scientists were able to increase the panel efficiency by 6.73% with a three-fin porous layer, by 9.19% with a five-fin porous layer, and by 8.34% with a whole porous layer.
The cost of the proposed technology would depend on the amount of aluminum foam.
“Its cost is around $1 per kg for a minimum amount of 10 kg,” Khlefat stated. “For instance, the amount of aluminum foam needed for a 10-panel system will be around 14 kg, so the cost will be around $14 to install five porous blocks per panel, the percent increase in the output electrical power will be around 21.75%.”
The group presented the cooling technique, which has yet to be applied commercially, in “Thermal cooling of Photovoltaic panels using Porous Material,” which was recently published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering.

Swiss energy company Axpo has secured a power purchase agreement from supermarket chain Denner for its 2.2 MW Alpin Solar, which is built at the Muttsee dam, at an altitude of almost 2,500 meters above sea level. The PPA is the first bilateral deal for an unsubsidized solar project in Switzerland.
“We want to promote this pioneering spirit,” said Denner CEO Mario Irminger. He did not provide details on the solar power purchase price, but did state that it was above today's market price level.
The energy company expects the plan to deliver around 3.3 million kWh of solar power per year, around half of which during the winter half-year, when electricity tends to be scarce in Switzerland. This is possible due to the location in the high Alps, where the sunshine is higher in winter than at lower altitudes as there is less fog and the snow increases yields through reflection.
In addition, the solar modules will be installed optimally facing south on the dam of the pumped storage plant. It is the highest dam in Europe, said Christoph Brand, CEO of Axpo, when presenting the project. Basel-based energy company IWB is also participating in the construction of the photovoltaic power plant through its Paneco subsidiary and owns a 49% stake in the project.
Brand also specified that the project is being built at a cost of CHF 8 million ($9 million) and that it is not exactly a bankable project. Nevertheless, the energy company decided to implement it in order to set an example for the energy transition in Switzerland. “We also see the project as an important contribution to the discussion for the upcoming legislative revisions,” continued Brand.
Switzerland's current incentive scheme for renewables is mostly designed for small, residential self-consumption systems. “And we also need large-scale renewables in our country,” Brand added, hinting at the planned decommissioning of nuclear power plants decided by the government.

The three projects, which are to be located outside natural reserves, are expected to cost around €170 million, the company said in a statement.
One of the three projects, a 120 MW plant, is planned for the artificial reservoir of Kastraki, near the homonymous town in Aetolia-Acarnania. Furthermore, GEK Terna wants to build a 103 MW floating array on the water reservoir of Pournari, located on Arachthos River, and a 42 MW plant on an artificial lake near Stratos, which is also in Aetolia-Acarnania.
The company said the three projects were part of its plan to deploy around 3 GW of renewable energy capacity over the next five years. Of this capacity, around 1.8 GW is already in operation, under construction or ready for construction in Greece, the US, Central and Eastern Europe.
According to Greek newspaper Ekathimerini, GEK Terna is not the only firm with plans to develop floating PV in Greece, as PPC Renewables SA (PPCR), a wholly-owned subsidiary of national utility Public Power Corporation SA, is also planning to install 50 MW of floating PV capacity in the country.
The company is reportedly considering Polyphytou, an artificial lake of the river Aliakmonas in the prefecture of Kozani, and a pond in Florina, in northwestern Macedonia, for the deployment of 50 MW.
Moreover, the newspaper reveals that Interphoton Investment has submitted a planning application to Greek regulator RAE for the construction of a 500 MW floating PV project which is also to be located on Polyphytou, at the southernmost part of the broader geological basin of Kozani-Servia. The solar facility is expected to occupy around 4% of the lake's total surface, according to Ekathimerini.

Although Canada is a relatively nascent solar market compared to the United States, the country relies heavily on hydropower for its clean energy and has even implemented federal and provincial goals to phase out coal use for electric power generation.
As for other types of renewables, the Canadian industry is growing and shows great promise. At least that’s the conclusion that can be drawn from a new report by the Canadian Renewable Energy Association (CanREA). The organization said that Canada’s wind, solar, and energy storage sectors ended 2020 in a strong position, with the industry ready to expand significantly in 2021.
Despite the challenges posed by the global pandemic, Canada ended 2020 with a total wind capacity of 13,588 MW, a total solar capacity of roughly 3,000 MW, significant growth in energy storage, and a “positive forecast for 2021,” said Robert Hornung, president and CEO of CanREA.
As in the United States, the Covid-19 pandemic caused supply-chain disruptions, energy-demand fluctuations, and workforce health concerns in Canada–all of which temporarily delayed many renewable energy projects from coming online in 2020.
Key figures
According to CanREA, Canada installed at least 70 MW of solar PV capacity in 2020, along with an additional 166 MW of wind power. The group said that wind and solar generation now meet 40% of electricity demand in Prince Edward Island and 18% in Nova Scotia, with the contribution approaching 10% in other Canadian provinces.
According to CanREA, wind and solar energy have contributed more to Canada’s installed electricity-generating capacity than any other technologies over the last decade. Much of this growth is attributable to significant cost reductions caused by technological advances. CanREA said the energy storage market is also growing. Canada currently has a total utility-scale energy storage capacity of more than 130 MW/250 MWh, with 10% coming online in 2020 alone.
With 240 MW of large-scale solar projects and 745 MW of wind projects currently under construction across Canada, CanREA said it anticipates significant expansion in the country’s non-hydro renewables industry over the next year. Overall, it expects close to 2 GW of wind and solar projects to be installed or begin construction in 2021.
The organization also predicts continued expansion for utility-scale, residential, and commercial storage, thanks to cost decreases and emerging regulatory and market frameworks. It noted that electricity system operators and regulators are actively working on options to integrate storage into the grid, including a review of market rules in Ontario and Alberta, and pilot projects in Quebec and Saskatchewan.
New opportunities
Despite the year’s challenges, CanREA said that 2020 offered new opportunities from multiple levels of government. The province of Saskatchewan and the city of Edmonton, Alberta, launched procurement processes, with Saskatchewan also seeking feedback on interest in battery storage projects in the province.
And the federal government and the province of Quebec both announced plans to procure low-cost, non-emitting electricity in the future.In January, the federal government opened a request for proposals to buy new clean electricity in the province of Alberta to power federal operations there.
CanREA said the year ended on a positive note, with the federal government announcing a new climate plan in December and Quebec presenting a new electrification strategy in November. Wind, solar, and storage are expected to play a central role in meeting the greenhouse-gas emissions targets.
“Customer interest in wind and solar energy is increasing, and there is a lot of optimism within the industry,” said Hornung. “We are ready to deliver the renewable energy solutions that will be central to Canada’s energy transition, with benefits for all Canadians.”

The ministry allocated 11 MW of capacity across eight projects, ranging in size from 1 MW to 3 MW.
The five successful developers include Electrofix Ltd., which secured 5.4 MW at four sites, and Luxury Living Technologies, which won 3.4 MW at two sites. George Baldacchino also made the list with a 1 MW plan, and Migvin secured a 1.2 MW project. The lowest offered price was €0.12 ($0.15)/kWh and the highest price was €0.129/kWh.
The procurement exercise was the third round of a tender program that started in late 2017. It involves three tenders for around 50 MW of total solar capacity. The first round, held in February 2018, allotted around 15 MW of capacity to developers. The second PV tender round was held in August 2018.
Malta had 154 MW of cumulative installed solar capacity by the end of 2019, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. The government supports rooftop PV with a net metering program. A feed-in tariff for solar arrays up to 1 MW in size was terminated by the government in May 2016.

In September, the Western Australian (WA) government invited worldwide expressions of interest (EOI) for its proposed 1.5 GW wind-solar-hydrogen hub at the Okajee Strategic Industrial Area (Okajee SIA). The midwestern part of the state has some of the world’s best solar and wind resources, and they could feed the development of WA’s green hydrogen economy.
This week, the state government of Premier Mark McGowan revealed that it has received 65 expressions of interest to produce and export renewable hydrogen at the greenfields Okajee SIA, with more than half of the submissions coming from international companies. Okajee SIA is located north of Geraldton.
Early assessments of the site's renewable resources suggest that its world-class wind and solar energy potential could provide up to 270 MW of wind and 1.25 GW of PV. To put this in context, Ad van Wijk, a professor of future energy systems at TU Delft in the Netherlands, estimates that it takes 25 GW of solar to generate 1 million tons of hydrogen annually. The WA government believes that with support from gas firming, it could generate electricity from Okajee SIA at attractive prices
“The strong response to the Okajee EOI process confirmed what we already knew about the strong global appetite for renewable hydrogen, and the enormous potential of the (region),” said WA Regional Development Minister Alannah MacTiernan. 
According to a WA government statement, EOIs came from Australia, Japan, South Korea, India, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, France and the United States. About 16% of these submissions expressed a desire to develop and finance an entire green hydrogen export supply chain. Others expressed interest in supplying particular sections of a supply chain such as technology, utilities, manufacturing, and finance.
The WA government said that at least 10 of the submissions came from ‘super majors,' or companies with global reach and hefty market capitalizations. Unfortunately, this rules out Blockbuster Video. 
“Global economies are hungry for clean, renewable energy, and we have the perfect mix of wind and solar potential that is the envy of the world right here in WA,” continued MacTiernan. “We look forward to working with the companies that expressed interest in this opportunity to bring the production of renewable hydrogen to Western Australia.” 
The EOIs will now be considered by the Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation with the Mid West Development Commission, Mid West Ports Authority, and DevelopmentWA.
As part of the state’s Recovery Plan the WA government is pushed up its Renewable Hydrogen Strategy targets by a decade (from 2040 to 2030) and topped up its green hydrogen fund. The state is now pumping AUD 28 million ($21.7 million) into the development of the state's renewable hydrogen sector.
