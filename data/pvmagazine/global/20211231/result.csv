According to JinkoSolar’s founder Kangping Chen, the collaboration could be the first-ever integration of next-generation N-type technology into solar hydrogen production.
Russia is ready to collaborate with the European Union on hydrogen projects, wrote the government-owned TASS news agency on Tuesday, quoting Russian envoy to the EU Vladimir Chizhov. “Gas pipelines of the newest generation, like the Nord Stream 2, can accommodate this in time, I would like to stress. Certainly, brownfield pipelines like the Ukrainian transit one will not provide such an opportunity,” Chizhov reportedly said.
All American Marine announced that Sea Change, a 70-foot, 75-passenger, hydrogen fuel cell-powered electric-drive ferry will operate in the California Bay Area. “This will be the first commercial hydrogen fuel cell passenger ferry in the world, representing a monumental step in the US maritime industry’s transition to a sustainable future,” the company wrote on its website. The vessel is equipped with a hydrogen fuel cell power package provided by Zero Emissions Industries, comprised of 360kW of Cummins fuel cells and Hexagon hydrogen storage tanks with a capacity of 246kg. The system is integrated with 100kWh of a lithium-ion battery provided by XALT and a 2x300kW electric propulsion system provided by BAE Systems. “While still working on permitting hydrogen fuel systems for maritime vessels with the US Coast Guard, the completed ferry will exhibit the viability of this zero-carbon ship propulsion technology for the commercial and regulatory communities.”
The Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), which creates the technology strategy for UK aerospace, said that the optimal configuration for hydrogen will resemble the two-decade attempts started in the 19070s, which led to the twin-engine design. “I’m sure that with hydrogen we’ll have the same thing – we’ll have lots of different versions and once again we will learn from those, sensibly and safely. It is arrogant to suggest that we can go from zero to hero and find the right configuration in the first product we build, but I’m sure it will be safe,” wrote the British institute, quoting Tim Galsworthy, FlyZero chief engineer. Earlier this month, the ATI unveiled a concept aircraft which could allow passengers to “fly anywhere in the world with no carbon emissions and just one stop.” Developed by a team of British experts under the government-backed FlyZero project, the concept suggests the “huge potential” of green liquid hydrogen for air travel for global connectivity. “Realising a larger, longer range aircraft also allows the concentration of new infrastructure to fewer international airports accelerating the rollout of a global network of zero-carbon emission flights and tackling emissions from long haul flights.”
ÖBB Postbus, the largest bus company in Austria, placed an order for five units of the Solaris Urbino 12 hydrogen model for the city of Villach in southeast Austria. “This is the first order placed under a framework agreement concluded at the beginning of 2021 and envisioning the option for the purchase of up to 40 vehicles of this type by the customer. The investment coincides with the execution of the H2 Carinthia project which aims to foster the development of hydrogen technology in this region,” ÖBB Postbus wrote on Wednesday. The framework agreement envisages the possibility of purchases by 2023. “Thanks to the technology used therein the bus can cover a distance of about 350 km completely emission-free under all kinds of conditions. Solaris shall deliver the vehicles by the end of November 2022.”
Italy’s Snam Group and the Torino Airport Management Company have signed a term sheet for the construction of a hydrogen-ready fuel cell system in cogeneration mode with a capacity of 1.2MW at Torino Airport. “The fuel cell, designed and developed by Snam's Hydrogen Business Unit in partnership with the American company FuelCell Energy, is the first of its kind and size in Italy that can be fuelled with variable percentages of hydrogen blended with natural gas for the combined generation of electricity and heat,” the Milan-based gas transmission system operator wrote on Wednesday. The company said that the fuel cell would be installed in the second quarter of 2023, adding that it can produce up to 1.2MWh of electricity and 840kWh of heat per hour and can be fueled by hydrogen mixed with up to 40% natural gas by volume. The value of the contract to be awarded should amount to around €14 million.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/31/reliance-industries-to-acquire-sodium-ion-battery-provider-faradion/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,INDIA,UNITED KINGDOM",MARIJA MAISCH,"DECEMBER 31, 2021",Reliance Industries to acquire sodium-ion battery provider Faradion,"India headquartered multinational Reliance Industries has continued its shopping spree in the renewable energy sector signing a binding agreement to acquire a 100% shareholding in UK-based sodium-ion specialist Faradion to the tune of GBP100 million (US$135 million).
The Indian conglomerate’s solar unit will acquire 88.92% of the equity shares of Faradion for GBP83.97 million at closing which is expected in early January. The remaining 11.08% of the equity shares will be acquired for up to GBP10.45 million within three years from the initial transaction.
Under the agreement, Reliance Industries will subscribe to new equity shares of Faradion for a value of GBP31.59 million, of which GBP25 million will be invested as growth capital to accelerate commercial roll out of Faradion’s patented battery technology.
Based out of Sheffield and Oxford, England, Faradion claims to have developed a sodium-ion technology that is more sustainable and affordable than other battery solutions on the market. Its technology is applicable in various fields, such as transportation, storage, backup power, and energy in remote locations. Set up in 2010, Faradion says it has developed an extensive IP portfolio to cover numerous aspects of Na-ion technology, focusing on three key areas- cell materials, cell infrastructure and safety and transportation.
Last year, shortly after it bagged its first order from ICM Australia, Faradion told pv magazine it was planning, along with its partner in India, to set up an initial production capacity of 1GWh in the country. Speaking about the country-specific advantages, Faradion CEO James Quinn said at the time that a vast majority of the raw materials are available in India for a vertically integrated supply chain.
Further, he said that Faradion's Na-ion cells can be made on existing commercial Li-ion manufacturing lines. The operating temperature range is -30 to +60 degrees. “Our cell chemistry provides world-leading cell-specific energy of 150-160 Wh/kg for sodium-ion,” Quinn told pv magazine.
Reliance plans to use Faradion’s technology at its proposed fully integrated energy storage giga-factory as part of the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex at Jamnagar, western India. The complex is part of Reliance’s ambitious $10 billion plan first unveiled in June to manufacture and fully integrate all the critical components of the renewable energy ecosystem, including every stage of  the solar supply chain, advanced energy storage, hydrogen production, and fuel cells.
Only this year, the conglomerate, which is covering everything from textiles and polyester fibers to petrochemicals and petroleum refining, as well as upstream oil and gas exploration and production, has made massive progress on its big plans via a series of acquisitions in the renewable energy sector.
Through its solar arm, Reliance is acquiring a 100% stake in Norway-headquartered PV module manufacturer REC Group. It plans to use REC’s technology and manufacturing expertise in its fully integrated, metallic silicon-to-PV panel gigafactory. It will initially start with 4GW of capacity per year and will eventually grow to 10GW.
Furthermore, Reliance will acquire a 40% stake in Indian multinational Sterling and Wilson Solar Ltd (SWSL), one of the largest PV plant engineering, procurement, construction (EPC), and operation and maintenance solution providers globally. Going upstream, it is investing $29 million in German wafer manufacturer NexWafe. For green hydrogen, Reliance Industries has partnered with Denmark-based Stiesdal for the technology development and production of Stiesdal HydroGen electrolyzers in India.
On the battery storage front, the company has invested $50 million in Ambri, a US-based calcium-antimony liquid metal battery startup incubated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), raising 42.3 million shares.
Commenting on the acquisition of Faradion, Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, highlighted the versatility of the company's technology. “Most importantly, it utilizes sodium, which will secure India’s energy storage requirements for its large renewable energy and fast-growing EV charging market,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/31/greeces-coal-phase-out-enters-shaky-ground/,"MARKETS,SUSTAINABILITY,GREECE",ILIAS TSAGAS,"DECEMBER 31, 2021",Greece’s coal phase out enters shaky ground,"Greece’s government announced in September 2019 that it aims to phase coal out of its electricity mix by 2028 at the latest.
Two months later, in December, the government published the country’s National Energy and Climate Plan which detailed ambitious renewable energy installation targets.
The new plan provided a detailed timeframe for the “shutdown of lignite-fired plants that are currently in operation, which is to be completed by the end of 2023.”
With this wording, “currently in operation,” the government was not considering Ptolemaida 5, a new power plant under construction in Greece’s Western Macedonia prefecture.
Then this May, it appeared the issue of Ptolemaida 5 appeared resolved, with pv magazine reporting that state-owned utility had announced a decision to operate the plant using an alternative technology starting in 2025.
Thus, it seemed clear Greece was holding true to its plan of shutting down all operational lignite-powered plans by 2023, with two plants ceasing operation in 2021. The date for phasing out coal was shifted to 2025, due to the conversion of Ptolemaida 5.
Nikos Mantzaris, a senior policy analyst at Athens-based thinktank The Green Tank, confirmed pv magazine’s analysis, adding one more crucial fact: at COP26, where Greece’s prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and minister of the environment and energy Kostas Skrekas reiterated that all operational coal plants would shut down in 2023; however, they said Ptolemaida 5 had until 2028 to switch to a new fuel, rather than 2025.
These timeframes have now been jeopardized this week by Greece’s ministry of the environment and energy (Ypen). Indeed, on Tuesday, Ypen published its decision to allow four operational lignite-powered plants to continue operations until the end of 2025. Another three lignite-powered plants have been permitted to operate for additional hours until the end of 2023. And, two oil-powered plants on the island of Crete have had their operational cycles extended to the end of 2024.
The latest developments are a clear setback from the country’s recent climate policy successes and run against the European Union’s policy mandates.
Following the publication of the updated timelines, Greece’s daily newspaper Kathimerini reported the news on Wednesday, stating that the ministry has accepted calls by state-owned utility PPC to extend the cycle of the nine power plants.
The PPC reacted: Within a couple of hours, the utility had published a very brief yet crystal clear statement saying that it only has one working plan which was the phasing out of all operational coal plants by 2023 and finding an alternative fuel for the Ptolemaida 5 plant from 2025.
Mantzaris told pv magazine: “Apparently there are still several voices trying to resurrect lignite in Greece. However, PPC’s firm and frequently re-iterated decision to abandon the most polluting fuel on the planet as soon as possible, in conjunction with the escalating CO2 prices guarantee that all existing lignite plants will shut down by 2023, while Ptolemaida 5 will cease burning lignite by 2025 at the latest.
“Nonetheless, the government still needs to ‘clear the air’ and reaffirm its commitment to this phase-out plan during the revision of the National Energy and Climate Plan.”
Sources at the energy ministry told pv magazine this summer that the ministry is preparing a new National Energy and Climate Plan, increasing the role of renewable energies, energy storage, and power interconnections in Greece’s energy system and market.
However, the policy framework for energy storage has been delayed and a tender for energy storage facilities has been pushed from the last quarter of this year back to the coming year.
On the interconnections front, the government has made some ambitious steps linking Crete to the mainland and initiating the interconnection of the country with Egypt, Cyprus, and Israel although linking Greece to its neighboring countries may take longer than 2025 to materialize.
Meanwhile, Greece was battered by a prolonged heatwave in the summer and extended wildfires which stretched the country’s energy system to its limits. To face the skyrocketing demand for power – mainly due to air conditioning – Greece utilized lignite-powered plants and asked its citizens to be energy savvy.
It appears that some figures are trying to exploit this situation, adding to the debate that the spiraling of the current wholesale electricity market prices in Europe indicates coal is a necessary tool to flatten power prices.
The government must resist such arguments. Greece’s policy shift to phasing coal out, which the present government adopted in 2019 and has boosted since then, was the result of a policy ecosystem pushing the debate forward. It was also the result of the PPC nearing bankruptcy due to its outdated portfolio and old business strategy.
The new PPC management understands that new technologies and a modern strategy are key to the firm’s survival. The Greek government seems to understand this too; however, policy decisions to extend the operation cycle of coal power plants crack the newly established decarbonization debate and endanger the recent progress been made.
Instead of this week’s setback, the government needs to step up energy storage development and the utilization of renewable energies that provide it with cheap power, independent of fuel price fluctuations and emissions costs.

Many industrialists are also planning to install solar on their factory rooftops.
Encouraged by the state-run Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA), leading businesses, including apparel factory owners, are beginning to show interest in utilizing their building rooftops to generate clean electricity.
“We are receiving increased number of queries from various business groups seeking assistance for setting up of rooftop solar facilities,” said Mohammad Alauddin, chairman, SREDA.
According to government data, a total of 1,601 solar rooftop facilities are currently generating over 75MW of electricity. However, many of the rooftop solar arrays, installed in the private sector, have not been included in the list.
State-run financier the Infrastructure Development Company Ltd (IDCOL) has so far approved 41 rooftop solar projects which will generate a total of 50MW of electricity. Officials said some 15 more projects are now awaiting approval which may have a generation capacity of 52MW collectively.
The IDCOL has set a target to finance rooftop facilities totaling 300MW by 2024, its chief executive officer Abdul Baki said earlier this month.
One leading example of a company that has already made significant solar rooftop strides is Scube Technologies Ltd, a Dhaka-based EPC contractor, which has signed deals for the installation of 38MW of rooftop solar power facilities in 2021. Its large-sized installations include 11.7MWp for the Meghna Group of Industries, 8.44MWp for BRB Cable Industries Ltd, 4.025MWp for the Al-Mostafa Group, 3.2MWp for the Robintex Group, 2.9MWp for the Osman group, and 2.5MWp for the Urmi Group.
Borhan Uddin Bhuiyan, deputy general manager of Scube Technologies Ltd said the net metering policy has encouraged businesses to opt for rooftop solar facilities to save on electricity costs.
Another Dhaka-based contractor, Solar EPC Development Ltd, is currently working on 15MW of solar rooftop projects. It is building a 3MW rooftop facility for the AKH Group, and a 2MW facility for the Khulna City Corporation, among others.
“Nowadays we are getting good responses from business,” said Ezaz Al Qudrat A Mazid, managing director, Solar EPC Development Ltd. He added that many foreign and local banks are coming forward to fund solar power projects.
Omera Renewable Energy, another big EPC company, has 6MW of rooftop solar facilities online, while installation of 4MW more is ongoing. These are expected to come online next March. Going forward, the company has order confirmations for 25MW more which are also expected to come online in 2022.
The largest rooftop solar plant that Omera Solar is currently working on is 3.67MW in size. It is slated to come online in March, said Masudur Rahim, chief executive officer, Omera Renewable Energy.
Other major business groups whose rooftop solar plants are now online include a 2.66MW facility for Square Textiles, a 2.02MW plant for Fakhruddin Textile Mills, a 1.72MW plant for Aswad Composite, and a 0.99MW plant for AT Snowtex Outerwear.
Work is also underway on a rooftop solar power plant for Bashundhara Packaging Ltd, Pran Group, Paragon Poultry Limited, Debonair Group, and Bengal Group, among others.
This June, Bangladesh’s largest solar rooftop, a 16MW facility, came online in Chittagong. The sponsor, Youngone Corporation of Korea, plans to expand the facility to around 40MW of generation capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/31/green-hydrogen-a-new-entrant-to-the-energy-sector/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"DECEMBER 31, 2021",Green hydrogen: A new entrant to the energy sector,"From pv magazine 12/2021
Large volumes of low-carbon hydrogen from excess renewable energy production can help to decarbonize the economy, and hence enable countries to reach their net-zero emission goals. Net-zero scenarios put forward by the International Energy Agency and the Energy Transitions Commission show hydrogen meeting between 15% and 20% of global final energy demand in 2050, all of which needs to be low carbon. This would increase the demand for hydrogen from under 80 tons today to well over 1,000 tons by mid-century and create a gigantic opportunity for renewables, in particular solar PV.
To what extent large-scale hydrogen will play a role in providing long-duration storage to net-zero power grids in the future is a hot topic on its own. However, green hydrogen production from small- and medium-scale electrolyzers offers considerable short-term potential. The key is for it to become commercially viable quickly, in order for it to help solve grid integration challenges.
To date, green hydrogen from electrolyzers fed by renewable energy is adopted in small volumes in demonstration projects, but the technology is on a path to commercial maturity. So, what makes co-located electrolysis and renewable generation financially attractive?
RTE, the French transmission system operator, ensures the stability of the grid by balancing supply and demand. Three grid-balancing services are currently tendered by RTE, differing in their required activation time response, duration, and occurrence of the service as shown in the table (bottom right).
Certain electrolyzers can run at part rated load factor and hence flex their demand in either direction in response to grid requirements. They produce hydrogen at a higher rate when there is an abundance of power which might otherwise be curtailed, and decrease production when renewable generation is scarce, and the market is tight. This capability allows them to participate in these tenders. Primary and secondary reserves are required every day to balance the grid frequency. The capacity market is only required during the tightest supply months of the year and ensures there is always adequate supply available to meet demand.
As part of Sacha Lepoutre’s master’s thesis, an analysis was undertaken to assess the ability of an electrolyzer, co-located with either solar or onshore wind, to provide ancillary services to the grid. The potential economic value of doing so for a pilot-scale commercial project was quantified. The scenarios modeled were solar+storage, with the remaining share of electricity supplied by the grid, as well as solar+grid electricity, guaranteed as renewable using green certificates (GO or Guarantee of Origin). Another scenario was wind+grid electricity guaranteed as renewable using green certificates (GO or Guarantee of Origin).
The results of the analysis are presented in the graph (bottom left), plotting the IRR achieved by each project scenario against the resulting or negotiated hydrogen offtake price.
Several conclusions can be drawn from the analysis. Most significantly, using the electrolyzer to provide one or more frequency reserve services improves profitability, with a consistent uplift in project IRR, irrespective of the renewable energy it is combined with. Grid services revenue contributed up to 10% of total project revenue for comparatively little additional capital outlay. Secondly, on the French market and for this specific project, feeding the electrolyzer with wind power may outperform solar. And thirdly, higher internal rates of return (IRR) are observed for electrolyzers that are only being reserved and not activated on the secondary reserve.
In other words, while not the primary purpose of an electrolyzer, the ability to provide ancillary services may create additional revenue streams and improve project economics of a PV or wind project significantly. This could lead to small and medium scale electrolyzers becoming a significant new entrant to the ancillary services market on the supply side. The potential knock-on impact on battery storage business models and ancillary services price pressures warrants further investigation.
However, key hurdles to bankability remain. Although several innovative projects considering frequency services have emerged recently, and manufacturers mention the feasibility of such projects, practical feedback from real demonstrator projects is currently missing. Moreover, to date, the lack of regulatory definition for green or low-carbon hydrogen adds significant uncertainty to the revenue streams.
Curtailment of renewables is already a problem, and this problem is going to exacerbate rapidly without a large-scale and price-sensitive dispatchable demand that can be ramped up when renewable power is available in excess. In the long term, electrolyzers may well provide a proportion of this dispatchable demand.
