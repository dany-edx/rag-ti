“The bifaciality factor of the Velvet module results circa 15% higher than the standard value of a bifacial module based on the PERC technology,” the Italy-based module manufacturer said, noting that their bifaciality factor goes up to 85%.
The Velvet Pro line for residential and commercial rooftop applications features a glass-glass structure with 120 or 144 HJT multi-busbar half-cut M6 cells. The modules with 120 cells come in five versions, with power ratings ranging from 380 W to 400 W, and power efficiencies from 20.9% to 22.0%. The open-circuit voltage is between 44.46 V and 44.88 V and the short-circuit voltage current spans from 10.73 A to 11.12 A.
They measure 1,755 mm x 1,038 mm x 30 mm and weigh 23.5 kg. The front side is covered with a 2 mm anti-reflection coating glass while the backside either comes as a 2 mm white or transparent glass.
“The glass-glass structure ensures high load-bearing capacity, strong mechanical stability, and exceptional resistance to weather agents,” FuturaSun said. “In addition, it reduces the risk of micro-cracks, snail track effect, and corrosion resulting from humidity, sand, and salt fog.”
The modules with 144 HJT cells also come in five versions, with power ratings ranging from 460 W to 480 W, and power efficiencies from 21.2% to 22.1%. The open-circuit voltage is between 53.21 V and 53.76 V and the short-circuit voltage current spans from 10.59 A to 10.81 A. They measure 2,094 mm x 1,038 mm x 30 mm and weigh 27.5 kg.
The Velvet Premium line for industrial and utility-scale PV systems features a glass-glass structure with 120 or 132 HJT multi-busbar, half-cut G12 cells.
The modules with 120 cells come in five versions, with power ratings ranging from 615 W to 635 W, and power efficiencies from 21.7% to 22.4%. The open-circuit voltage is between 44.76 V and 45.47 V and the short-circuit voltage current spans from 17.18 A to 17.42 A. They measure 2,172 mm x 1,303 mm x 35 mm and weigh 35.3 kg.
The modules with 132 HJT cells also come in five versions, with power ratings ranging from 680 W to 700 W, and power efficiencies from 21.9% to 22.5%. The open-circuit voltage is between 49.51 V and 50.14 V and the short-circuit voltage current spans from 17.19 A to 17.42 A. They measure 2,384 mm x 1,303 mm x 35 mm and weigh 38.7 kg.
The new products can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and feature an IP67/IP68 junction box with anodized aluminum frames. They have a temperature coefficient of -0.26% per degree Celsius and their operating temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C.
They come with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1.0% and 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 88% of the nominal output power.
“This stability is also due to the new module’s cells, which are light-induced degradation (LID) resistant, since the n-type cells are doped with phosphorus and not boron,” said FuturaSun.

“Alkylammonium chloride, which is dequantized at the crystallization stage while combining with perovskite components, was used,” said researcher Sang Il Seok. “This optimal combination with Alkyl was also able to optimally control the rate of volatilization with solvent during coating and heat treatment of perovskite precursor solution.”
The scientists built the cell with a metal halide perovskite known as formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), which offers superior thermal stability and a narrow bandgap. The new process enables the creation of a dense perovskite film with good crystallinity, they claimed. They investigated the surface morphology of the film via grazing incident wide-angle X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy.
“RACl added to the precursor solution was believed to be easily volatilized during coating and annealing,” they explained.
They tested the film in a perovskite cell and found that it achieved a power conversion efficiency of 26.08%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.18 V, a short-circuit current of 25.7 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 86.15%. When tested by NREL experts, the device achieved a certified efficiency of 25.73%.
The researchers presented the cell tech in “Controlled growth of perovskite layers with volatile alkylammonium chlorides,” which was recently published in Nature.
“This study is very meaningful, as it examines the crystallization process of perovskite with halide anions in real time through the UNIST-PAL Beamline of Pohang Accelerator Laboratory,” said researcher Tae Joo Shin.

Polymer materials commonly used for backsheets and encapsulants play an important role in protecting a module’s inner workings from the elements, and with ever higher performance to protect, and growing expectations as to a PV module’s lifetime and extended performance, suppliers of these materials are moving with the times.
“The choice of polymers has a significant influence on the properties of the PV modules not only for efficiency but more importantly for reliability, as most PV module degradation modes are directly linked to polymer degradation and material interactions with polymer components,” said the scientists behind new work on understanding polymer degradation in PV modules.
The research, led by the OFI Austrian Research Institute for Chemistry and Technology, aims to quantify the influence of these polymers on PV performance and degradation over time and to develop models for degradation that could be useful to manufacturers in choosing new materials that have little or no track record in PV installations.
“Many gigawatts of modules with new technologies and materials can be produced and installed without having sufficient experience about long-term reliability,” the group said. “In the worst case, this has led to unexpected degradation mechanisms several years after field deployment, which were not predicted in laboratory accelerated testing, such as potential-induced degradation (PID) or backsheet cracking.”
The group fabricated and tested six-cell modules with varied combinations of encapsulant and backsheet – including the current industry standard encapsulant material ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), and two others currently seeing rapid commercial development – polyolefin elastomer and thermoplastic polyolefin. Backsheet materials included in the study are polyethylene terephthalate laminated with a fluorinated polymer layer (PPF), and coextruded polypropylene (CPO).
All possible combinations of these materials were then put through accelerated aging tests, operated at 85 C and 85% relative humidity for up to 6,000 hours. The results from the tests are available in the paper “Quantifying the influence of encapsulant and backsheet composition on PV-power and electrical degradation,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
With the data from the testing, and further measurements from sample modules collected from the 2015-18 period, the group used statistical modeling to find links between the backsheet and encapsulant performance and overall module power and degradation. The results showed that the combination of TPO encapsulant and CPO backsheet achieved the highest initial performance, and that modules with EVA encapsulant showed significantly faster degradation than either of the polyolefin based materials.
The group said that its approach offers an example of how the role of materials not directly involved in the module’s energy generation can be quantified, and that with further developments the modelling approach could be used to identify materials that could help manufacturers meet requirements for longer lifetimes, with some now expecting modules to keep generating power for 40 years or even longer.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/01/dutch-study-confirms-feasibility-of-pv-plants-on-dikes/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 1, 2023",Dutch study confirms feasibility of PV plants on dikes,"A recent report by PV on Dykes – a Dutch project consortium that includes the Dutch Foundation for Applied Water Research (STOWA) and the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) – has assessed the technical viability and environmental costs of deploying ground-mounted solar along dikes in the Netherlands.
“We see that PV on paved dikes is most promising for the moment,” Maarten Dörenkämper, a researcher at TNO, told pv magazine. “On grass, it is more challenging, this needs further research to come to specific suitable configurations for grass dikes.”
The dikes and their surfaces represent an untapped opportunity to build solar plants in a land-scarce nation with a high population density. The Netherlands has approximately 17,000 km of dikes and a preliminary study has shown that they offer the potential to host 11 GW of PV systems, without occupying agricultural land.
In addition to serving as water barriers, dikes in the Netherlands are often used for recreation, especially for cycling. Over time, they have come to be seen as cultural-historical landscape elements.
“On top of the technical feasibility, it is very important to carefully investigate, where these systems can be placed. We have studied and identified with GIS analysis the most promising locations for these systems based on social acceptance factors,” Dörenkämper added. “Dikes located in a more industrial setting, are the ‘low hanging fruit'  in terms of social acceptance.”
The scientists said in their report that they have tested four kinds of pilot-scale PV systems. The first was a 39.5 kW system with a fixed mounting structure on grass. The “TNO-Eurorail” system is deployed on grass and features a mounting structure on small piles installed in the ground at a limited depth, so that they do not cause major damage to the dikes.
The solar panels are placed at a height of between 80 cm and 1 m, which allows sheep to graze under the panels. The DC cabling between the mounting structure is buried without a conduit, as the use of casing pipes on a dike can cause tunnel formation.
The second installation, developed by Dutch technical service provider Delmeco, is a 6.8 kW PV system replacing the grass with a concrete element hosting each panel. The weight of the components and the bonding of the solar panels also prevents theft and makes the system vandalism-resistant.
The third demonstrator, built by Dutch developer Soltronergy, is a 5.4 kW installation featuring stainless steel cables mounted on steel yokes between concrete ballast blocks. It features lightweight plastic PV panels that are placed vertically at a height of 80 cm and are able to slightly rotate in line with the wind, the scientists said.
The fourth project, developed by Dutch landfill specialist Afvalzorg, is a 20 kW system placed on Solarbase, a dike-hardening material for the solar panels. The system is made of certified secondary raw materials and replaces the grass cover of the dike. The DC cabling is largely inaccessible and concealed under the panels, while the inverter is placed at the foot of the dike.
The scientists found that PV systems that are installed and fit well into current dike construction practices can be technically and economically feasible, without much additional research.
“Systems that are largely shading grass coverings have not yet proved suitable from a water safety point of view,” they said. “We have investigated different PV panel layout configurations, which allow different irradiation levels to reach the grass surface. However as the degradation of the grass cover is a slow process, we cannot come to the most optimum and definitely safe configuration at this point in time. We also observed that the systems are performing well from an electrical performance point of view and no direct erosion formation has been observed.”
The Dutch authorities are struggling to identify surfaces on which to deploy large-scale PV plants, due to the scarcity of land. In recent years, research institutes and private companies have tried to prove the feasibility of solar projects on non-agricultural land, including rooftops, road noise barriers, onshore and offshore water surfaces, and bike lanes.

The storage technique uses wind and solar electricity to power systems that combust metal power, usually iron or aluminum, and make it react with heated air or steam.
“The heat released can be used to drive turbines which in turn produce electricity,” the scientists said, noting that at the end of this process, the metal oxide remains as a powder. “Alternatively, one can choose to produce hydrogen gas, in which case the combustion takes place with hot steam.”
They said that by using solar or wind power, the oxidized powder can become ordinary metal again. The claimed that the process is safe, cheap and fossil-free.
“Using electrolysis, the metal oxide can be converted back into metal,” said the researchers. “It can be done by pouring the metal oxide powder into a solution with cryolite into which two current-carrying electrodes are inserted to start a chemical reaction.”

The research group plans to build a facility based on the circular process at a brewery in southern Sweden, where electricity production needs to be expanded. Their work builds on multi-year research efforts on the burning of metals such as iron and aluminum.
“The pilot plant will be like a small coal-fired power plant, but where the coal is replaced by iron,” said researcher Marcus Aldén.
The team hopes to replicate the plan at other locations in Sweden's Skåne region.
“Together with some research groups in Germany, Canada and Holland, we came to the conclusion that these common metals are so promising as both an energy source and an energy carrier that they could function as an element of the energy supply,” the academics said, without providing additional technical details. 
The researchers are likely referring to the Max-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung in Germany and TU Eindhoven in the Netherlands, which published a paper in Acta Materialia in October to present a similar technology.

Rooftop solar will soon become Australia’s largest power generation source, overtaking coal from April, when the Liddell coal power station is scheduled to retire. The installed capacity of rooftop solar in Australia just hit the 20 GW mark, with over 3.4 million solar power systems installed on Australian households and businesses, according to analysis of the Clean Energy Regulator’s REC Registry.
“When the Liddell coal fired power station closes in April 2023, rooftop solar will have a greater capacity than the remaining coal fired power stations operating across the country,” said Warwick Johnston, managing director of SunWiz.
Australia currently leads the world in solar uptake, with more than 1.2 kW of solar power per person.
“Australian solar power systems are more affordable than in any other country, so it’s understandable that we lead the world in per-capita uptake of solar,” said Johnston.
The next issue of pv magazine, due out on March 9, will focus on the solar manufacturing technology enabling the new era of market expansion and high efficiency modules, including interdigitated back contact (IBC) and perovskite tandem solar cells. The magazine charts the latest technical and investment decisions in the high efficiency solar manufacturing segment and the materials and R&D underpinning them. Reports come in from France, Japan, India, Indonesia, Israel, England, the US, and China and we also examine the troubles of the solar-powered car pioneers.
There are more than 8,000 accredited solar installers in Australia, said Sunwiz. In addition to rooftop solar systems, there are more than 11 GW of larger industrial solar power systems and grid-scale solar farms, it added.

The largest portion of this capacity is represented by PV systems ranging in size from 200 kW to 1 MW, accounting for 8,270 MW or 33% of the total. The second-largest segment is installations with outputs ranging from 20 kW to 200 kW, with a share of 5,057 MW, or 20% of the total.
Solar arrays with capacities of less than 12 kW account for 4,949 MW, or 20% of the total, followed by systems with capacities of 1 MW to 10 MW, for a 16% share, or 3,942 MW.
Italia Solare says that PV plants above 10 MW have a share of 1,479 MW, or 6% of the total. PV systems with capacities ranging between 12 kW and 20 kW reached 1,351 MW at the end of December, for a share of around 5% of the total.
The regions with the largest share of total new capacity additions are Lombardia with 3,149 MW, Apulia with 3,063 MW, Emilia Romagna with 2,512 MW, and Veneto with 2,484 MW.
The residential segment, or PV systems below 12 kW, was still the largest market driver last year, with around 1,103 MW of new installed capacity, said Italia Solare. This was followed by the large-scale plants above 10 MW in size, at 289 MW.
“For 2023, a doubling from this year is very likely, and for 2024 a further doubling, so we are talking about 2 GW, 4 GW, and 8 GW,” Italia Solare President Paolo Rocco Viscontini told pv magazine at the recent Italia Solare Forum in Rome.
The Italian government is currently supporting large-scale solar via an auction system and rooftop solar through net metering and several fiscal incentives.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/01/greece-struggling-to-connect-1-gw-of-installed-pv-to-grid/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,GREECE",ILIAS TSAGAS,"MARCH 1, 2023",Greece struggling to connect 1 GW of installed PV to grid,"Greece’s licensing policies are theoretically robust, with set deadlines to be respected by state institutions and renewable energy investors. New legislation (Law 4951/2022) is designed to expedite the licensing process for renewables even more, so green projects can be fully licensed within about a year.
A clear process applies to small-scale solar farms that need to connect to the grid. Investors start by applying for a grid-connection license from Greece’s distribution grid operator, HEDNO. The application must include guarantee letters from financial institutions.
If a grid-connection request is fully documented, HEDNO issues a preliminary license within four months, detailing all terms and conditions of the contract. Investors then have two months to accept or reject these terms and conditions. If the investor agrees, HEDNO will sign a final grid-connection agreement within four months, allowing the project to connect to the grid.
However, Pospief General Secretary Petros Tsikouras told pv magazine that these time scales have never been respected by HEDNO. He noted that it often takes up to 12 months to process grid-connection requests, even though it is supposed to do so within four months, for example.
Tsikouras said the situation becomes even worse toward the end of the process, after investors have accepted the terms and conditions of the license, when a project is fully built and the grid connection is still pending. HEDNO is usually slow, so investors are left with various financial burdens, such as bank loans, for several months. Meanwhile, their completed solar projects remain offline, generating no income.
Tsikouras said these final delays in particular could be easily be resolved if the Greek government stopped protecting HEDNO’s role in the grid-connection process for new projects. Given HEDNO’s failure to comply with the set time frames, Pospief is calling for investors to be allowed to build their own grid-connection lines. However, the Greek government confirmed HEDNO's complete monopoly on issues related to grid connections in 2020.
“HEDNO typically subcontracts construction companies who connect our solar farms to the grid,” said Tsikouras. “But they are unable to do so in a timely manner while this monopoly runs contrary to the free economy credentials that the government says it promotes.”
Built projects below 500 kW in size that wait to connect to the grid are often in danger of losing the stable feed-in tariff (FIT) rates that Greece provides, as pv magazine has previously reported. Tsikouras said that small PV plants were able to secure stable FITs by Dec. 31, 2022, as long as they were connected to the grid within set deadlines. However, HEDNO was often unable to connect such projects to the grid in a timely manner, so the government came to the rescue by allowing offline projects to retain their FIT rates if they could prove they were built on time, added Tsikouras.
Apart from net-metered arrays and community energy projects, the small-scale PV segment in Greece is about to die, said Tsikouras. The current government and the previous administration did nothing to expand grid infrastructure for renewable energy. There is little available grid capacity now for additional small-scale plants, other than ones that were already licensed and awaiting grid connection.
HEDNO does not even accept new requests to connect plants to the grid and this is not set to change any time soon. The only exceptions to this are net-metering installations and community energy projects, for which HEDNO has freed up about 2.5 GW of grid space. The transmission system operator has also set aside grid space to connect large utility-scale projects.
However, Tsikouras said that developers and investors have been calling for the expansion of the grid for years, yet the government has never listened. Unless grid operators expand their grid infrastructure soon, renewable energy will not expand in any meaningful way in Greece. Energy storage technologies could provide alternative solutions, but the government’s plan to run energy storage tenders in 2021 failed. The country is not expected to launch new storage tenders before the end of this year, either.

Lightsource bp has agreed to purchase 4 GW of First Solar's thin-film PV modules. Delivery is expected to take place between 2026 and 2028.
The order adds to a 4.3 GW purchase made in 2021. The deal includes Series 6 Plus and Series 7 solar modules. The modules are designed and developed at First Solar’s research centers in Ohio and California.
“We are seizing the opportunity by not just growing our 20 GW development pipeline across the United States, but also creating sizeable demand for our US-based partner First Solar, which, in turn, is investing in innovation and manufacturing, and supporting thousands of direct and indirect American jobs,” said Kevin Smith, chief executive officer of Lightsource bp.
As part of the supply agreement, Lightsource bp has also committed to using First Solar’s module recycling program. The company is a market leader in PV recycling, operating a program that provides closed-loop semiconductor recovery for use in new modules, while also recovering other materials including aluminum, glass, and laminates.
In addition, First Solar is the first PV manufacturer to have its product included in the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) global registry for sustainable electronics.
“This is another sizable commitment by Lightsource bp and a reflection of their trust in First Solar and our technology,” said Georges Antoun, chief commercial officer of First Solar. “Our relationship with Lightsource bp is a partnership in growth. We enable their growth with certainty through long-term pricing and supply commitments, and advanced technology, while they enable ours by providing the certainty of demand we need to invest in manufacturing.”
First Solar is expanding its manufacturing capacity across the United States to meet this demand. The company expects to start running a third factory in Ohio in the first half of 2023, and a fourth factory in Alabama is currently under construction and expected to go online in 2025. The factories will produce Series 7 modules.
Separately, Silicon Ranch – a Nashville-based independent power producer – said this week that it has procured an additional 1.5 GW of advanced US-made thin film solar modules from First Solar. The deal expands upon a master supply agreement between the two solar businesses, which includes a 4 GW transaction announced in April 2022 and, more recently, a 700 MW commitment announced in October 2022. Whereas the prior agreements will supply Silicon Ranch projects through 2025, the 1.5 GW follow-on order will serve projects in 2026 and 2027.

France's energy regulator, the Commission de Régulation de l'Énergie (CRE), has released FITs for rooftop PV installations up to 500 kW in size for the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023.
The new tariffs for the fourth quarter of 2022 range from €0.2242/kWh for installations below 3 kW in size to €0.1228/kWh for arrays ranging in capacity from 100 kW to 500 kW. The new tariffs for the first quarter of 2023 range from €0.2349/kWh for installations below 3 kW in size to €0.1287/kWh for arrays ranging in capacity from 100 kW to 500 kW.
The tariffs for the sales of surplus power under net metering will range from €0.0048/kWh to €0.0010/kWh for the third quarter of 2022, and from €0.0050/kWh to €0.0011/kWh for the first quarter of 2023.
The French government raised the size limit for PV projects that can qualify for fixed tariffs from 100 kW to 500 kW in October. In order to boost development in the rooftop segment, the government also decided to reduce the degression rates planned for the feed-in tariffs.
