New forecasts by Absolar, the Brazilian solar energy association, suggest that new investments in the PV sector could exceed BRL 38.9 billion ($7.8 billion) in 2024.
The trade body said the PV sector is expected to generate more than 281.6 thousand new jobs next year, spread across all regions of Brazil, providing more than BRL 11.7 billion of extra revenue for the state budget.
Developers are expected to install more than 9.3 GW of solar capacity in 2024, reaching a cumulative total of over 45.5 GW, up 26% from 36.1 GW at present.
Solar is expected to maintain the same level observed in 2022 and 2023, contributing to the social, economic, and environmental development of the country, according to Ronaldo Koloszuk, president of the board of directors of Absolar, and Rodrigo Sauaia, the CEO of Absolar.

The two companies will test the storage technology in a pilot project for six to 12 months in Delft, the Netherlands. The objective is to investigate the scalability of Aquabattery's technology and its commercial viability.
Aquabattery's patented storage technology uses saltwater as a storage medium. The tech is described as a flow battery that is able to independently amend power (kW) and energy (kWh) capacity. It is also said to be low-cost, highly scalable, and sustainable, as it uses only water and table salt, with its storage capacity being expandable by just adding water reservoirs or using larger tanks.
The battery system uses three storage tanks, one with fresh water, one with concentrated salt water and one with diluted salt water, and also relies on membrane stacks. During the charging phase, the diluted salt water is split into concentrated salt water and fresh water in the membrane stack and stored separately.
The separation is achieved through electrodialysis (ED), which is a separation process in which charged membranes and electrical potential differences are used to separate ionic species from an aqueous solution and other uncharged components.
In the discharging phase, the two streams are combined and the resulting energy is converted to electricity with the help of the membrane stack through reverse electrodialysis (RED), which is a technology to generate electricity from the salinity difference between two solutions, for example, seawater and river water.

Heliene, a supplier of North American-made solar PV modules, has invested an additional $10 million to expand its manufacturing and assembly line at its facility in Mountain Iron, Minnesota.
Minnesota Line One was first installed in 2018 at 150 MW and has now doubled in capacity to 300 MW with this recent investment. Line One is situated contiguously to a second, 500MW line installed in 2022. The company reports that the upgrades will improve the efficiency of the line and enable the production of TOPCon solar modules.
Heliene has a technology roadmap that calls for the manufacture of PERC modules up to December 2024, while TOPCon will be the new technology starting in February 2024. There will be an overlap of PERC and TOPCon throughout 2024 within the company’s three manufacturing lines.
“The reason Heliene and many other solar equipment manufacturers are moving into Topcon and/or HJT is to advance its product offer, to make these products more efficient,” Heliene CEO Martin Pochtaruk told pv magazine USA. “Not different than when everyone went into monocrystalline only, leaving polycrystalline in the past.”
The expanded line is also expected to create an estimated 130 new jobs in Minnesota’s Iron Range. When asked about the challenge in finding workers, Pochtaruk said that paying more and providing full benefits for the employees and their families has shown to be a good plan. He also noted that Heliene works with the local trade colleges to design curricula to meet the company’s needs.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/06/nuclear-who/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",ANGELA SKUJINS,"DECEMBER 6, 2023",Nuclear who?,"The “World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2023” overseen by French nuclear energy consultant Mycle Schneider shows that despite the significant global presence of the nuclear industry, which produced 2,545 TWh of energy last year, the sector is shrinking, with renewables looming large due to cheap costs and popularity.
Schneider told pv magazine that as costs between solar and nuclear continue to widen PV continues to come out on top.
“In the longer term, soft costs determine solar electricity prices and their key factor is the density of installations,” he said.
“This is no doubt the main reason why China was able to add over two-thirds of its gigantic 85 GW 2022 solar additions as decentralized, mainly rooftop, installations, systematically implementing programs through entire counties thus super high density of projects.”
Diverging LCOEs
Schneider said the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar and wind projects is lower than nuclear. He cited 2022 data collected by US-based Lazard showing the LCOE for combined solar and wind can be $45–130/MWh which is well below nuclear’s estimated mean of $180/MWh.
Schneider said there has only been one nuclear reactor construction license awarded in the United States, given to the NuScale with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS), but operations were terminated in November as the project “did not identify enough subscribers for the projected power output at the projected price.”
“Estimated construction costs, long before construction starts, as the design has not been certified yet by the safety authorities hit $20,000/kW, which is about twice the cost estimate of the most expensive European pressurized reactors (EPRs) in Europe,” he said.
Schneider said fourth-generation reactors, described as “PowerPoint Reactors”, would not be able to compete with renewables as they “hardly exist on the drawing board” and have not been certified by licensing authorities.
“How can we discuss potential competitiveness if there is no design, no existing fuel chain, no safety analysis?” he said. “However, these ideas are decades away from implementation at any scale if ever. Many of these conceptual ideas, like fast neutron reactors or molten salt reactors, have been talked about for decades. The probability that they will ever exist is shrinking with the widening cost gap of existing designs with renewables.”
New reactors
Schneider said renewable energy and nuclear energy will never be complementary energy sources. He used Olkiluoto-3, the first European enterprise resource planning project, as an example. The nuclear facility had “hardly” started commercial operations in April 2023 when its output was reduced in May due to unprofitable wholesale market energy prices. It could not compete with the flexibility of renewables, Schneider said.
“Increasing penetration of variable renewables like wind and solar need fine-tuned, flexible, complementary elements like demand-response, storage, efficiency, sufficiency, hydro, and biomass,” he said. “Nuclear power needs to run as many hours as possible to amortize the huge upfront investment.”
Schneider said wind and solar technologies work well together and can produce a large chunk of the energy grid's base load. Not only this, he said, but they also “eat” into nuclear's profitability. “There are many systemic characteristics that clearly illustrate that not only are renewables and nuclear not complementary but they are increasingly contradictory as renewables increase their share,” Schneider said.
What is in the “World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2023”
The report states that renewable technologies – consisting of solar, hydropower, and wind – are the main area of “optimism” for energy security. “Nuclear power remains, at best marginal and all too often irrelevant to the challenges ahead,” the document reads.
The report also states last year and this year were pivotal for examining and improving the international energy sector. Insecurities exposed by the Ukraine war and the climate emergency forced countries to develop new industrial and economic strategies to strengthen domestic supply chains and manufacturing.
As a result, solar’s total installed capacity at the end of 2022 reached 1,047 GW. The industry increased its annual production at an “unprecedented” speed, with an annual production of 1,309 TW/h. In more than a decade the LCOE for utility-scale solar projects has decreased by 83% but rose by 47% for nuclear, meaning that nuclear power is “the most expensive generator.”
“Aside from natural gas peaking plants at discount rates of less than 5.4 percent, nuclear turned out always the most expensive resource on an LCOE basis,” the analysts said. “The growth of renewable energy is now not only outcompeting nuclear power but is rapidly overtaking fossil fuels and has become the source of economic choice for new generation.”
Nuclear fleet
Global energy power generation for nuclear dropped by 4% last year, according to the report. This is despite a net addition of 4.3 GW in operating nuclear power capacity and four reactors being decommissioned.
As of the end of June, however, 58 new reactors were under construction, which is five more reactors than last year, the document states. The share of the nuclear global commercial gross electricity generation fell to 9%, which, according to the report authors, is the largest dip since 2012 – the year following the major Fukushima nuclear accident.
“At the end of 2022, the nominal net nuclear electricity generating capacity had peaked at 368 GW, two having added 5.3 GW during the year, 1 GW more than the previous 2006 record of 367 GW, but it dropped again to 364.9 GW by mid-2023,” the authors of the report stressed.
They also explained that at the end of June, 407 operational reactors in 32 countries produced 365 GW. This is less than the 413 GW of installed solar capacity expected to be reached by the end of 2023, according to forecasts provided by New York-based research firm BloombergNEF.
Construction time
Reactor construction times now average six years, which is a drop since last year, the report states. Despite the expedited process, however, other challenges loom, such as year-long delays, “lengthy” licensing procedures, complex financing negotiations and site preparations.
China is developing the most new nuclear facilities, clocking in 39 from 2012 to 2021. The country also deployed the only SMRs in 2023: the twin-High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor units, according to the report. But the authors write they were subject to a “historical pattern of cost escalations and time overruns,” meaning it will be “less likely” for SMRs to be commercialized in the future
“Despite optimistic numerical targets for expansion, the proposed role for nuclear power in a decarbonized world faces continued competitive pressures on both cost and technical capabilities,” according to the report.
“This includes the economics of operating reactors and the funding of new ones.”

Solar on a neighbor’s rooftop may influence another neighbor to go solar, especially if the solar is visible and if the neighbor talks about it. However, the level of influence is not even across income levels, as Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory researchers note in “The role of peer influence in rooftop solar adoption inequity in the United States,” which was recently published in Science Direct.
Understanding peer influence in the solar buying decision is important as the solar industry strives to roll out solar to increasing numbers of households. As it is discovered that peer influence is not as strong among low- to middle-income (LMI) households, the solar industry may be better able to adjust its marketing focus and policy makers may consider changes to policies to increase LMI adoption.
As a data source, the researchers used records of over 800,000 US rooftop solar installation records compiled by BuildZoom, an online platform connecting households with service contractors. They then used customer addresses to match the solar records to modeled household-level income estimates generated by Experian and eliminated tracts with daily adoption rates of >10% as extreme outliers or possible data errors.

Relaunching a French industrial sector for the production of olive oil is the goal set by the Oil’Ive Green network of producers, based in Villemoustaussou, a commune in the Aude department in southern France.
“In France, we only produce 5,000 tonnes of olive oil per year, while we consume 120,000 tonnes every year,” said Yannick Masmondet, general manager of Oil'ive Green, whose objective is to cultivate 50,000 hectares of olive trees, for the production of edible oil and biofuels, in the next decade.
However, like many agricultural crops, olive cultivation is today affected by climate change, driving the decline in farm productivity. This is why the company signed an exclusive partnership with Spanish energy producer Iberdrola to develop agrivoltaic solutions in synergy with olive growing and support the diversification of wine-growing areas.
The two sides will identify farms to host agrivoltaic project in New Aquitaine, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur and Occitanie. The agrivoltaic power plants mounted on solar trackers will then be specifically adapted to olive growing carried out in “fruit hedges” on agricultural areas of several tens of hectares.
“The technical and agronomic support in the face of climate change, the gain in productivity and the economy generated by the agrivoltaic plant will allow operators to develop and perpetuate their activity, and for those who wish to diversify into olive tree cultivation, to finance and facilitate their reconversion,” said Thierry Vergnaud, development director of the land branch of Iberdrola France.
Iberdrola said fruit hedge management associated with agrivoltaics should promote agronomic gains through the physical protection of trees against climatic hazards such as hail, late frost, and leaf burns, among others. Solar panels will also prevent soil drying by maintaining a sufficient level of humidity for crops, without having to resort to irrigation.
Iberdrola said that wine growers will receive technical and agronomic assistance for cultivation, along with regular additional income as needed, throughout the entire 30-year operation of agrivoltaic plants, enabling them to start production from the third year.

“Our new heat pumps operate down to -20 C of outdoor air, providing hot water of 75 C at 0 C of outdoor air temperature,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “They are a good replacement for gas boilers in older light commercial buildings.”
The new product utilizes propane (R290) as a refrigerant and has a seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) ranging from 4.44 to 4.50. Its coefficient of performance (COP) spans from 3.52 and 3.67.
The manufacturer offers the new heat pump in four versions with a power output of 8 kW to 30 kW.
The smallest device measures 1,253 mm x 1,066 mm x 547 mm and the largest has a size of 1,887 mm x 1,816 mm x 749 mm.
The company said the new product relies on inverter scroll compressors, axial fans, condenser coils with seamless copper tubes and aluminum fins. It also uses a water-side brazed plate heat exchanger and an electronic expansion valve.
“It is configured as a plug & play unit thanks to an integrated hydronic module,” the spokesperson said.

Depcom Power has commissioned the Ciro One project, a 90 MW (AC) solar facility in Puerto Rico, along with a 51.5 MW battery energy storage system (BESS). The US-based engineering company said it is currently the largest operational solar-plus-storage facility on the island.
Depcom Power built the plant with development partner Ciro Energy Group and local subcontractor Lord Construction. The project is expected to begin operations at the end of this year. Depcom Power will operate and maintain the hybrid system for a period of five years.
The company said the BESS features a lithium titanate oxide (LTO) battery. It claimed that the use of LTO ensures a guaranteed system life of 25 years, surpassing the 20-year lifespan of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) technology.
It said the PV system is designed to resist hurricane-force winds. “The inverter technology includes salt fog filters to mitigate the effects of salinity on the system's power electronics,” said the company.
The installation owner will also use sheep to manage vegetation at the project site.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/06/wending-technology-improves-battery-performance-for-ess/,"SPONSORED,WORLD",,"DECEMBER 6, 2023",Wending technology improves battery performance for ESS,"When choosing among the many different battery types for an energy storage system (ESS), we have to keep in mind the key characteristics that customers are really focused on. The first characteristic is energy efficiency, which is important when the energy is coming from renewables, like solar or wind. If we put 100 kilowatt hours into the storage system, we want to get as much of that back out again. The efficiency of a lithium ion battery is almost 95%. However, a nickel hydrogen battery, for example, might have high energy density, but its efficiency is only around 35%.
The second characteristic is the cycle life. Lithium ion batteries can achieve up to 10,000 cycles, which means 10-20 years of total life. And the last one is the rapid response capability. For example, pump storage systems may be less expensive, but they cannot respond very quickly, whereas a lithium ion battery can respond in less than 10 milliseconds.
The 320 Ah Wending battery has a 15% improvement in energy density compared to a traditional, commercial 280 Ah battery. This means we can increase the amount of energy stored while using the same amount of land, which decreases total system cost.
Also, higher energy efficiency means that energy output will also be higher, which improves the return on investment. On top of those benefits, the higher energy efficiency reduces the amount of heat that’s generated and reduces the carbon emissions, which are also important to the consumer.
Because Wending technology is an innovation both for cell chemistry and structure, it can be applied to any kind of battery cell, which means it can be used for small scale projects and large scale projects that connect to the grid. The ESS acts like a reservoir for energy, helping to balance the grid and make it more stable. The higher efficiency of the Wending batteries allows us to store more energy, decreasing the rate of generation to meet peak demands, which is better for our environment.

We developed the Wending technology just within the last three years and we have already achieved mass production for our 320 Ah cells. At the same time, we are working on multiple ways to evolve this technology for all kinds of products and for all of our customers. First, we are improving the battery storage capabilities from 320 Ah to 345 Ah, and this battery will begin mass production in 2024.
Second, we will evolve the Wending technology innovation to improve not only the lithium ion phosphate batteries, but also our NCM batteries. Third, we will continue to evolve our Wending batteries not only for ESS, but also to be used for electrical vehicles.
By moving from 280 Ah cells to 320 Ah cells using Wending innovation, we can reduce carbon emissions by about 54 kilograms per cell over the whole lifecycle. Our vision at REPT is to power a greener future for our planet, and the Wending technology helps us achieve that vision.

“The stress test module is suitable for perovskite solar cell degradation tests. You can stress the device and without moving the sample, you can perform advanced characterizations in DC, AC and transient mode,” Daniele Braga, Head of Sales and Marketing, Fluxim, told pv magazine, adding that advanced characterizations are done during the device stress testing without intervention and based on user-defined protocols.
Data acquisition is supported and managed by the pre-installed software. “For numerical solar cell simulations, you can integrate Paios with our Setfos simulation software,” said Braga.
The stress applied to the solar cells can be voltage, current or maximum power point tracking. Furthermore, the illumination and temperature levels can be controlled. Versatility and consistency are two key benefits of the Paios system, besides the compact size, according to Braga who explained, “You can run many different individual test routines without having to change the setup, nor do you have to change the position of the sample device for each test sequence.”
Typically used within a glovebox or inside a chamber with a controlled atmosphere, Paios is used for a wide range of measurements, for example current-voltage (IV), impedance spectroscopy (IS), charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV), intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), and deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS).
Its add-ons include an automated custom probe station, variable LED sources and detectors, as well as cryostats and a spectrometer.

However, the inclusion of cobalt in this type of batteries has been considered as problematic due to its anticipated scarcity as well as associated supply chain risks related to its single source, human rights and mining practices.
Now, a team led by researchers from the University of Tokyo has designed a lithium-ion battery pairing a cobalt-free cathode with a silicon suboxide (SiOx) anode, successfully addressing the cobalt challenge.
“There are many reasons we want to transition away from using cobalt in order to improve lithium-ion batteries,” said Professor Atsuo Yamada from the Department of Chemical System Engineering. “For us the challenge is a technical one, but its impact could be environmental, economic, social and technological. We are pleased to report a new alternative to cobalt by using a novel combination of elements in the electrodes, including lithium, nickel, manganese, silicon and oxygen — all far more common and less problematic elements to produce and work with.”
Underlying this favorable electrode combination is a rational electrolyte design based on 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC featuring a shifted potential, which serves to aid formation of robust passivation layers on the anode and promote electrolyte stability against both reductive and oxidative degradations.
In addition to featuring electrodes and electrolytes devoid of cobalt, the new battery design has also displayed a number of advantages over conventional lithium-ion batteries. It has an energy density about 60% higher, which could equate to longer life, and it can deliver 4.4 volts, as opposed to about 3.2-3.7 volts of conventional NMC batteries.
In addition, test batteries with the new chemistry were able to fully charge and discharge over 1,000 cycles, simulating three years of full use and charging. In the process, they were losing only about 20% of their storage capacity.
“We are delighted with the results so far, but getting here was not without its challenges. It was a struggle trying to suppress various undesirable reactions that were taking place in early versions of our new battery chemistries which could have drastically reduced the longevity of the batteries,” said Yamada.
“And we still have some way to go, as there are lingering minor reactions to mitigate in order to improve the safety and longevity even further. At present, we are confident that this research will lead to improved batteries for many applications, but some, where extreme durability and lifespan are required, might not be satisfied just yet.”
The seasonal, December and January edition of pv magazine reveals the much-anticipated winners of this year’s pv magazine Awards. We also consider the ramifications of the current global oversupply of solar panels, Australia’s prospects of refining battery raw materials, and examine how the European Union’s green hydrogen ambitions are developing.
According to the researchers, their  electrolyte formulation offers a pathway towards both sustainable and high-performing lithium-ion batteries, while the concept could be applied to other electrochemical energy technologies, including other kinds of batteries, water splitting (to produce hydrogen and oxygen), ore smelting, electro-coating and more.
Their findings are discussed in “Electrolyte design for lithium-ion batteries with a cobalt-free cathode and silicon oxide anode,” published in Nature Sustainability.

New draft rules from the US Department of Energy state that enterprises “owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction” of China, Russia, North Korea or Iran, will not be eligible for subsidies under the nation’s USD 369 billion ($550 billion) IRA, nor the USD 550 billion Infrastructure and Jobs Act.
The upper limit of both direct stakes or “cumulative” investment is 25%, according to the draft guidance.
China is far and away Australia’s biggest trade partner, including for lithium and other critical minerals. China’s dominance in the sector has meant that a number of Australian projects have substantial Chinese ties. These ties come in the form of Chinese project ownership, investment, and off-take agreements.
For instance, Western Australian project Greenbushes, which produces most of Australia’s lithium, is owned by Chinese company Tianqi and US giant Albermarle. Tianqi also holds a majority stake in the Kwinana lithium hydroxide refinery, which produced Australia’s first commercial quantities of battery-grade lithium hydroxide in 2022.

From a power demand perspective, with the weather mild enough not to require extra heating or cooling for open spaces, moderate power demand levels are typically observed in spring and many minimum (operational) demand records are also broken in this season. However, a key contributor to minimum ‘operational demand’ is the energy yield from rooftop solar. This Opinion and Analysis piece presents a deep dive into the unprecedented impact of rooftop solar in the NEM.
Per capita, Australia is currently the global leader in rooftop solar installations with about one in three homes generating their own power. In 2022, rooftop solar contributed a staggering 26% of total renewable electricity generation in Australia with the total installed capacity currently almost double that of grid-scale solar across the NEM (16.3GW vs 8.7GW). This astonishing growth in rooftop solar started well over a decade ago through very generous (and arguably uncoordinated) federal and state government policies and rebate schemes which assisted many households overcome the upfront installation cost hurdle. As technology breakthroughs led to downward pressures on the cost of solar panels, many Australian households saw this technology as a great hedge against rising power prices through the years.
The rooftop solar phenomenon in Australia has had significant impacts across the NEM, including changing the intraday demand shape, revenue cannibalization for large-scale solar projects, changing the intraday operations of thermal assets, as well as an increased need for flexible generation through a changing intraday ramp profile. As seen in Figure 1, across all mainland states, rooftop installations in the last six years have grown by factors of 3x to 4x across all mainland states – an astonishing outcome. New South Wales, in particular, has seen such huge growth in the last six years that it has just recently overtaken Queensland (the ‘Sunshine State’) as the leading state in Australia in rooftop installations. However, across the same mainland states, operational peak demand has remained relatively flat over the same period.
As defined earlier, operational demand is the total demand less rooftop/embedded generation. Therefore, assuming that total demand remains the same, as rooftop generation increases, operational demand during the day decreases. Given operational peak demand in Australia occurs after sunset, this implies that rooftop solar generation is a key driver of intraday ramping needs in the NEM across all mainland states.
As seen in Figure 2, the intraday demand ramp (down and up) – driven by rooftop PV growth – in New South Wales in particular (also true for all mainland states) has been growing over the years. This is expected to continue driving investment in flexible resources. The average demand trough to peak ramp in New South Wales is now about 3 GW. With the state facing a significant supply gap from coal retirements (about 6 GW) in the next 10 years, it is yet to be seen how this ramp profile will be met by gas and storage technologies. Recently, there have been announcements of large battery projects in the state such as the Riverina and Darlington Point Energy Storage Systems. Another key development to watch in the storage space is the 2 GW Snowy 2 pumped hydro project; it is unclear how quickly the project developers can bring the project online to help manage this growing intraday ramp in the state.
On a positive note, this rise in rooftop installations in New South Wales has (to an extent) masked the supply gap left by Liddell’s retirement last year. Perhaps these two events (Liddell’s retirement and recent rooftop growth) are related and to be expected as consumers try to protect themselves from high power bills left by wholesale supply shortage – though this is one for further analysis.
As mentioned above, this ramp trend is seen in all mainland states and represents an ongoing challenge state and federal government and other policy makers must solve as thermal coal assets progressively exit the NEM. Figure 3 depicts the difference in average time-of-day demand between 2023 and 2017 across all mainland states. While peak demand in these states has hardly moved, the trend for demand within the day has shifted (and continues to shift) predominantly driven by rooftop solar. The common trend seen across all states is the drop in midday demand and an increase in the non-daylight hours demand; highlighting the continued impact rooftop solar is having on ramp profiles through the years.
In Queensland, the average midday demand has dropped by over 1 GW whilst the evening peak has increased by over 250 MW in six years. Victoria has seen a similar stretch of the intraday demand profile over the same period with midday demand dropping by about 1 GW and the evening peak increasing by over 200 MW. New South Wales – which has the largest peak load – has seen the biggest change in its intraday ramp with average midday demand dropping by close to 2 GW and the evening peak increasing by about 100 MW. These trends call into question the evolving flexibility needs in each state and what the ideal generation mix should be for the future NEM given the (somewhat) inflexible profiles of the existing coal generation assets which dominate the generation mix in these states. Although we have seen a lot of final investment decision (FID) announcements on grid-connected batteries, distributed storage remains a challenge. Given the current trend in rooftop solar growth, it is only a matter of time before the policy makers look to the distribution network for some system ramp mitigation mechanisms.
South Australia, however, is unique compared to other mainland states for a variety of reasons. The state currently:
With South Australia’s peak demand of about 3 GW (about a third of the next lowest mainland state), the penetration of rooftop solar in the state has an amplified impact on operational demand. As seen in Figure 1 earlier, the gap between rooftop penetration and peak demand in South Australia is the tightest of all mainland states and it is only a matter of time before these two lines intersect – signifying a higher installed capacity for rooftop than peak demand in the state. As such, during spring season, when demand is typically lower and solar irradiance typically high, the impact of rooftop solar on operational demand in South Australia is clearly pronounced. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) had for a while predicted that South Australia was on track to have a zero (or negative) operational demand event. We have now witnessed a few of these events in South Australia and at the time of writing, the latest event of zero and negative operational demand in South Australia happened on 1 October 2023 (Figure 4).
On this spring day in South Australia, the operational demand for the grid eventually went to zero (and below) around 1 pm, with rooftop solar contributing a whopping 78% of the total generation. With demand at this level, all other generation was exported to the neighboring state of Victoria with 6% from grid solar, 13% from wind and 4% from gas. Interestingly, despite being an expensive source of generation and not being in the merit order during this period, 70 MW of gas generation was instructed on by the market operator for system security purposes due to the high penetration of renewables. Noteworthy is the utilisation of a few grid batteries as well during this event as they were taking advantage of the excess supply to charge their assets.
The focus of this piece has been on operational demand, the impact of this phenomenal growth of rooftop solar, however, goes beyond demand.
With these levels of embedded rooftop generation, market prices are also severely impacted especially during the typical spring day. Instances of negative pricing are exacerbated during spring stemming from an oversupply of low-cost renewables and lower-than-usual operational demand.
As seen in Figure 5, instances of negative pricing have increased over the past six years in mainland states. In fact, across all mainland states, 2023 has already broken the count record for negative prices even with two months to go. Unsurprisingly, a majority of these negatively priced periods have occurred in spring. This year, spring season already accounts for a third to over half of the total negative pricing seen in mainland NEM. Interestingly, New South Wales barely had any negative pricing until about three years ago; the rise in these pricing events coincided with the phenomenal rise of rooftop solar in the state as seen in Figure 1.
The key question here, however, is: What correlation – if any – is there between rooftop solar and negative pricing events? As shown in Figure 6, seasons with high solar irradiance (summer and spring) show a higher percentage of underlying total demand met by rooftop solar in all mainland NEM states. However, as also seen in the figure, these seasons also accounted for the highest counts of negative prices in these mainland NEM states. Spring, in particular, displays the clearest correlation between rooftop solar penetration and negative pricing events. In 2023, the first two months of spring have collectively accounted for about 35% of the negative prices seen in mainland NEM, with rooftop solar averaging around 15% of total underlying demand. Nevertheless, rooftop solar is only a factor in driving negative pricing with other factors such as energy yield from grid-connected renewables and inflexibility of coal generation also playing a role in these pricing outcomes.
Policy makers have attempted to reduce the impact these large power exports from homes is having on the grid. For example, in South Australia, starting this financial year, policy makers have introduced a new rule requiring all new rooftop systems to install a new inverter control technology which unlocks the ability for exports to the grid from these systems to be remotely ramped up and down as needed by the grid. In other states, such as Queensland, some distribution network providers are exploring the possibility of switching off these exports all together as opposed to having flexible control of these rooftop solar systems.
Looking ahead, it is hard to see any slowing down of this phenomenal growth in rooftop solar capacities across the mainland states in the NEM. With much of Australia’s coal-dominated generation set to retire over the coming decade, in addition to the existing government incentives, it is expected that price increases that typically come with these retirements will only contribute to the uptake of rooftop solar as consumers look to reduce their power bills.
This changing energy supply mix towards cleaner technologies, as well as the changing intraday demand shape driven predominantly by rooftop solar uptake is expected to drive increasing flexibility needs in the coming years. The extent to which this leads to a large uptake of distributed and/or community battery storage systems is left to be seen. Encouragingly, we are beginning to see a slightly higher uptake of grid-scale battery storage technologies with some innovative project financing underpinning their development.
It is clear that there is much for the global power community to learn from Australia in this area of rooftop solar connections and its impacts on power grids. For example, NEOM, a city with a 100% renewable energy ambition, has the advantage of building its system from scratch, and as a consequence, implement a robust strategy for Distributed Energy Resources (DER) from the get-go in its central planning and design. When planned well, DER such as rooftop solar can have very positive impacts on power systems. For example, DER resources can keep the lights on for critical businesses (such as hospitals) during a major outage event to a transmission line.
In conclusion, Australia’s unprecedented growth in rooftop solar connections illustrates how quickly power grids around the world are evolving through DER, and the potential we have as a global power community to harness them for our good; we simply need some flexibility in thinking through its associated challenges.
