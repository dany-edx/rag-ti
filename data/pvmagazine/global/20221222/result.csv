It only allocated 8,5 TWh out of the 34 TWh of renewables capacity up for sale, but solar accounted for 96% of the 204 winning bids.
For installations smaller than 1 MW, the auction awarded 150 MW of solar. The reference price was PLN 0.375/kWh. The lowest bid came in at PLN 0.24477/kWh and the highest bid was PLN 0.32773/kWh.
For installations larger than 1 MW, 582 MW of electricity was split between solar and wind technologies, amounting to 57% of all allocated capacity. A total of 51 solar producers submitted 70 bids, with 336 MW of PV and 245 MW of wind being awarded. The reference price for solar was PLN 0.355/kWh, while the lowest bid came in at PLN 0.23677/kWh.
Only one company joined a third auction dedicated to hydroelectric power plants. According to the regulator, the remaining four auctions were unresolved due to insufficient bids.
The president of the Energy Regulatory Office, Rafał Gawin, cited Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the related energy crisis as the reason for disappointing uptake in the latest auction round.
“The instability and high uncertainty of market forecasts of energy prices, noticeable differences in reference prices in individual baskets, as well as the changing legal environment contribute to the decline in the attractiveness of [renewables] auctions … it seems that in the coming years we can expect less interest in [renewables] auctions in favor of long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for the sale of electricity,” said Gawin.
Between 2016 and 2022, Poland allocated 6.78 GW of solar in its renewable auctions. The nation currently has 1.2 GW of installed capacity, with 4.9 GW of new solar additions in 2022, making it the third-best solar market in the European Union, according to SolarPower Europe.

French railway operator SNCF Réseau and INES have entered into a collaboration to develop photovoltaic systems capable of operating at voltages up to 9,000 V. They aim to facilitate the use of renewable energy by rail infrastructure, in order to reduce energy losses and optimize network costs.
The partnership will develop solar-based technical solutions to supply continuous power at 3 kV, 6 kV, and 9 kV, while optimizing installation costs, particularly with regard to cables, operation, and maintenance. The two sides also aim to ensure that these technologies have lifespans that are broadly equivalent to conventional photovoltaic systems.
At present, the market does not offer panels for voltages above 1,500 V. INES will therefore advise SNCF Réseau on the development of PV panels with voltages of 3,000 V.
INES is installing a 3,000 V experimental plant as part of the European H2020 Tigon project. The system will integrate photovoltaics and power electronics. It will also have a multi-microgrid infrastructure to test different system configurations involving PV modules, batteries, inverters, and fuel generators.
The medium-voltage direct current (MVDC) modules will be connected to the microgrid via innovative converters. It will serve as a showcase to efficiently increase PV production, while interconnecting these assets within the MVDC network, said the two sides.
Additionally, the MVDC microgrid will be connected to the main grid through a solid-state transformer (SST), making the whole system smarter and more digital. It will include an energy management system specially designed for AC/DC hybrid networks, as well as a decision support system to improve the efficiency and reliability of the entire network.

Adani Solar, the photovoltaics unit of Adani Group, has become India’s sole producer of large-sized monocrystalline silicon ingots for M10 and G12 wafers.
Gautam Adani, the chairman of Adani, recently unveiled the new ingots at the group's Mundra facility. The company said the monocrystalline ingots will drive the production of renewable electricity from silicon-based PV modules, with efficiencies ranging from 21% to 24%.
Adani Solar is a part of Adani New Industries Ltd. (ANIL), which is trying to develop the world’s largest green hydrogen ecosystem. It completed the backward integration of the ingot line infrastructure in about seven months.
The new manufacturing line will exclusively produce silicon ingots for Adani wafers, solar cells, and PV modules. The company has started initial production and plans to add 2 GW of ingot and wafer capacity by the end of 2023. By 2025, it will scale that up to 10 GW.
“We have made remarkable technological progress in every aspect of solar manufacturing in the past, from cells to modules, and we intend to replicate our past successes in our future endeavors as we backward integrate all the way to producing metallurgical grade silicon from quartz,” said Puneet Gupta, the CTO of Adani Solar.
Adani Solar set up India’s first gigawatt-scale silicon-based cell and module factory in 2016. It ramped up its annual production capacity of solar PV cells and modules from 1.2 GW in 2017 to 4 GW in 2022, which made it the nation’s largest vertically integrated PV manufacturer.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/12/22/solar-aid-in-dark-times/,"GEOPOLITICS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UKRAINE",,"DECEMBER 22, 2022",Solar aid in dark times,"On Feb. 24, the unthinkable happened. Russia invaded Ukraine. Immediately people thought, how can we help? What can we do? Around a week before the war started, when tensions were rising, I ordered a little survival tool: a solar powered radio with a crank. It arrived a day before Russian tanks crossed the border. I had a little relief. Whatever happened, I would have a light and could charge my phone. Then I thought, this is exactly what Ukrainians would need now.
Russia has begun destroying Ukraine’s civil infrastructure to drive people out of the country, halting electricity, water, and now heating. It was not clear this would become a strategy when we began our help effort but we knew being able to charge phones, communicate, access information through the internet, radio and TV, and see maps would be very important. Not to mention the basics of having light at night and in dark bunkers, too.
On March 1, we had our monthly Eurosolar Berlin-Brandenburg Zoom meeting. Our guest, booked much earlier, was Helmut Wolman, who was running a project with Ukrainian NGOs to build a network of energy cooperatives in Ukraine via open-source software digital communities provider WeChange.de. Helmut planned to discuss this activity, started the previous summer. WeChange had visited Ukrainian cities and Ukrainians had come to Berlin to discuss decentralized renewables as a bottom-up movement.
It quickly became obvious we had a perfect network to distribute assistance to Ukraine. After that, everything proceeded quickly: we discovered trucks from Berlin would go to Poland and our Ukrainian contacts could collect items there. I contacted sponsors including Jörg and Ute Müller, from renewable business Enertrag AG; Paul Grunow, founder of solar manufacturer Q Cells and solar testing organization PI-Berlin; and trade body SolarPower Europe. The next challenge was sourcing reliable solar devices as quickly as possible.
Oliver Lang, from off-grid solar company Sonnenrepublik, in Berlin, has spent decades developing mobile solar charging devices. He had some systems available and on March 5 the first packages were shipped. That first load contained 10 folding, lightweight, 50 W solar modules with 24,000 mAh (milliampere-hour) power banks plus several smaller devices.
On March 12, the delivery reached Ukraine. Partner organization and local environmental NGO Ecoclub Rivne received and distributed the goods. Our Ecoclub contact, Dmytro Sakalyuk, had been an energy management and planning system consultant to more than 200 Ukrainian municipalities, so we had a direct municipal contact with people on the ground. Ecoclub visits communities and delivers help directly or via its contacts, with other supplies being delivered at the same time as solar charging kits.
“Since March, Ecoclub has given about 400 solar chargers and power banks to communities in the east of the country, [including to] doctors and volunteers. The opportunity to be in touch, to learn news, to contact relatives is priceless. For it, we and everyone who uses the received equipment are grateful to our friends and partners from Germany who have been looking for all kinds of opportunities to support Ukrainians since the beginning of the invasion. We sent equipment to the communities of Zelenodolsk, in Dnipropetrovsk oblast, to the community and hospital of Selydove (Donetsk), to Novohrad-Volynskyi (Zhytomyr), to Kharkiv and to Sumy oblast, and the hospital of Myrnohrad, in Donetsk oblast.”
On March 23, our second delivery reached Zelenodolsk, in southern Ukraine. To widen our supply chain, we contacted Austrian mobile solar company Sunnybag. It has its own fundraising activities and uses us as a distribution channel in Ukraine. Like Sonnenrepublik, Sunnybag offered us favorable purchase conditions.
We moved our fundraising to donation site betterplace.org (and you can make your own contribution to our efforts here). Helmut is on the board of Ideen³ and the ideas platform enabled us to issue donation receipts for contributions to our “Ukraine needs freedom energies” page. We have received more than €23,000 ($23,600) from private sponsors, to whom we would like to express our thanks.
Our next step was to put systems together which featured 160 W folding modules plus power stations with inverters, to deliver AC power. Several smartphones and a PC could be charged at the same time from such standalone systems.
The feedback from Ukraine to both systems was overwhelming. When one of our main sponsors heard that Ukrainians were starting to collect money themselves, so that we could send more systems, he was convinced that this was the help required.
We know that our assistance is but a drop in the ocean of the help required and we are ramping up our efforts. Our contacts in Ukraine say that they urgently need power banks, power stations, and whatever can provide such equipment with electricity. Liliya Gnatyuk, a professor from Kyiv who visited Berlin at the Wandellab event we hosted as a part of our effort, said that she and her colleagues desperately try to continue teaching their students remotely, while doctors in Lviv are performing heart surgery without electricity.
In winter, solar chargers are slower but still effective – especially in southern Ukraine, near the Black Sea, more than in the north. Even bicycle-powered chargers could help: they use a dynamo to load a power bank instead of bike lights. We are planning to add some dynamo-based systems and even some small wind turbines to complement the solar panels and power stations – scaling them to micro, yet versatile, power systems. Those systems could also help power tiny houses, whenever the reconstruction of Ukraine can start. For these reasons, every donation in support of our endeavors is welcome and will help not only immediately but to work as a model case for rebuilding Ukraine.

The results have been confirmed by ISFH.
“Addressing the long-term pain point of HJT cells, Longi’s R&D team focused on market demand and technological innovation to achieve the new conversion efficiency for its commercial gallium-doped silicon wafer, 0.44% higher than the 26.12% announced in September this year,” the company said in a statement.
The Chinese PV module maker announced a power conversion efficiency of 26.12% for the same solar cell in September, and an efficiency rating of 25.47% in March.
For the indium-free HJT cells, the team replaced traditional indium-based transparent conductive film with alternative materials. It claims the different materials are cheaper and more environmentally friendly.
“The development also offers a potential solution to the industry’s dependence on indium for large-scale mass production, signaling a way forward for HJT to move towards terawatt scale production levels,” said Longi.
In November, Longi claimed a record-breaking 26.81% efficiency rating for an unspecified HJT solar cell. In addition, the Chinese manufacturer recorded an efficiency of 26.5% for a n-type heterojunction solar cell in June and a 25.19% rating for a p-type TOPCon solar cell in July 2021. In June 2021, it reported a 25.21% efficiency rating for an n-type TOPCon PV cell.

The Ile de Romainville project includes 3.3 MW of battery energy storage and a 33 kV system to transmit electricity to the main island of Mahe.
The Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) financed the project, which was jointly developed by Masdar and Seychelles-based Public Utilities Corp. (PUC). It is part of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and ADFD Project Facility, which is an initiative to scale up renewables in developing countries. It is only the second clean-energy project in the Seychelles, according to Masdar.
Masdar built the solar plant on the island of Romainville, which hosts several wind turbines from ADFD and Masdar’s Port Victoria Wind Farm. It specifically designed the PV installation to maximize the use of available land, while allowing for the maintenance of the wind turbines and minimizing shading losses, Masdar said in a statement.
“By saving about 2,000,000 liters of fossil fuel annually, Ile de Romainville solar PV plant will enable the country to significantly reduce its carbon footprint, provide a wide range of benefits to its people and empower small businesses,” said ADFD Director General Mohamed Saif Al Suwaidi. “The project will also make energy more affordable and accessible to the population.”
The Seychelles heavily relies on fossil fuels to meet its electricity demand, with fossil fuels accounting for around 20% of the country’s imports. It has set a target of 15% renewables by 2030. According to IRENA, the nation's cumulative solar capacity stood at 9 MW in 2021.
