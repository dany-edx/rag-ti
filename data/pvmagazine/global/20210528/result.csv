Around €4.4 billion come from his Federal Ministry; up to €1.4 billion from the Federal Ministry of Transport. The federal states will provide the remaining funding. Among the 62 projects, some will focus on electrolysis capacity to produce green hydrogen. According to the estimates, they should lead to 2 GW of new electrolysis capacity, corresponding to 40% of the 2030 target set in the National Hydrogen Strategy presented last year (5 GW). “Green hydrogen and fuel cells — across all modes of transport — are a super complement to battery-only vehicles. The fact is: we urgently need and want to push the transition to climate-friendly mobility,” Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer said on Friday.
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) called on governments to increase public support for green hydrogen, as incentives should be the key element for the ramp-up of the supply chain. “Current government incentives and policies targeted at electrolyzers and infrastructure remain limited. But solutions can also be drawn from the experience governments have gained in supporting renewable energy in power and heating, as well as from policies in the industry sector,” the organization wrote in its new report, “Green Hydrogen Supply: A Guide to Policy Making.”
Eleven projects have been selected in the framework of H2 Hub Airport, a call for expressions of interest to contribute to the hydrogen airport ecosystem in France. Groupe ADP, Airbus, Air France-KLM and the Île-de-France Region, with the support from Choose Paris Region, launched the call in February. The initiative paves the way for the Airbus hydrogen aircraft (planned for 2035), while promoting the short-term development of hydrogen uses on the ground. According to a note released on Thursday, some projects are in the R&D phase, while others, more advanced, could be commissioned in the medium term. “We are pleased by the success of this call for expressions of interest, which will contribute in making Paris Region a territory for the deployment of hydrogen,” commented Valérie Pécresse, chairwoman of Paris Île-de-France Region.
French energy company Total acquired a 20% stake in Hysetco, a French company developing hydrogen mobility in cities. The other shareholders are Société du Taxi Electrique Parisien (STEP), Air Liquide, Toyota and Kouros. “Hysetco currently owns around 700 taxis in Paris, with still a majority of diesel vehicles that will transition gradually to become exclusively comprised of hydrogen vehicles by 2024. The hydrogen taxis are fueled by a dedicated network of hydrogen stations operated by Hysetco. This network is expected to expand in the coming years to support the growth of a hydrogen vehicle fleet,” reads a note released on Wednesday.
Over the last week, Energy Observer and the City of Paris organized an event to raise awareness about the energy transition. Taking place through May 30 on the Champ-de-Mars, the Energy Observer exhibition village brings together concrete applications of hydrogen mobility and systems. Among the industry players taking part are EODev, Toyota, Delanchy, Air Liquide, Chéreau, Alstom, Airbus, La Poste, Engie and Pragma Industries. As part of the event, the Eiffel Tower was illuminated using an electro-hydrogen generator developed by EODev (Energy Observer Developments) with certified renewable hydrogen, according to Energy Observer.
Peugeot, the French carmaker owned by Stellantis Group, announced that its new e-Expert Hydrogen will first be offered to its commercial customers in France and Germany from the end of 2021. “It will be produced in France, in Valenciennes, and then transformed in the Stellantis competence centre dedicated to hydrogen technology in Germany, in Rüsselsheim,” reads a note released on Thursday. The vehicle includes a new “mid-power plug-in hydrogen fuel cell electric” system, made up of a fuel cell and a 10.5 kWh high-voltage lithium-ion rechargeable battery. According to Peugeot, the vehicle can be filled up with hydrogen in three minutes for a range of over 400 km.
Italian gas transmission system operator Snam launched the Hydrogen Innovation Center, calling it “Italy's first national center of excellence for hydrogen technologies.” The Milan-based company aims to bring together industrial partners and university research centers to accelerate the development of the sector, extending the company’s partnership network abroad within the next two years. The first site of the Hydrogen Innovation Center will be opened in Modena, under a collaboration agreement between Snam and the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. “Other hubs in the country will follow, including one with the Polytechnic University of Milan; by the end of 2021, an overseas hub will also be established, in collaboration with a prestigious university in the United States,” the company said Wednesday.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that the Russian government had proposed to Saudi Arabia to team up on hydrogen production during an online meeting of Russia and Saudi Arabia's intergovernmental commission. “We have a proposal to create a working group on hydrogen energy,” Novak said, as reported by Reuters and Al Arabiya.

The G1 products with the size of 158.75mm were priced at RMB4.79 per piece, with an increase of RMB0.40, 9.1%, compared to the previous value. The new price for M6 wafers with the size of 166mm increased by RMB0.40 to RMB4.89 per piece. The 182mm M10 wafers were priced at RMB5.87 per piece, up RMB0.48. It is the second time that Longi has raised its prices in May after doing so on May 14.
The Silicon branch of the China Nonferrous Metals Association reported this week that polysilicon reached a price of RMB200-210 per kg, and that the highest price exceeded RMB230 per kg. Major downstream buyers and upstream suppliers are in price negotiations for long-term supply orders for next month. According to industry sources, many prices for long-term orders have risen to around RMB200 per kilo and even higher. Some buyers have started trying to settle price for July. Since average supply prices rise sharply, industry observers say wafer prices are estimated to continue growing in June.
Chinese rack and tracker supplier AntaiSolar announced on Thursday that it had signed strategic cooperation agreements with distributors One Stop Warehouse (OSW) of Australia and Paramount Group (Paramount) of Bangladesh. OSW will distribute and sell 2 GW PV racks from 2021 to 2024 in Australia. Paramount will work closely with AntaiSolar for distribution of its rack and tracker products in Bangladesh’s PV market.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/28/containerized-retractable-pv-system-for-quick-deployment/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SWITZERLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 28, 2021","Containerized, retractable PV system for quick deployment","Switzerland-based start-up PWRstation has developed a container-based retractable PV system solution that is claimed to allow a large number of solar panels to be deployed very quickly by a single person.
The solution is based on the company's Exorac Tryptic racking technology which can include two racks able to host up to 30 solar panels. The system can be retracted, tilted and locked into the container, which the manufacturer says protects it from threats such as theft, vandalism or hurricanes.
The racking system is designed in Switzerland at the company's headquarters, which also manages the suppliers of the components, distributed between Europe and Asia, the routing to the assembly sites and the delivery to customers.

“We are working on a 40-foot container product for the military and emergency response markets, which will offer 100 solar arrays of 3 kW each that can be loaded and unloaded in less than half an hour,” the company's CEO and founder, Roberto Albertella, told pv magazine.
The price for a tryptic able to host 15 solar modules is CHF 6,350 ($7,050). This price includes 15 lightweight solar panels rated at 375 Wp each. A double-door container can accommodate two tryptics. PWRstation only provides the PV solution, including the Exorac deployment system and solar modules.
The solution is sold to customers that design solutions for power generation, water or air treatment and other applications that require solar energy. It is more complex and more expensive than traditional PV installations, as it is designed to be easily relocated to allow the use of solar energy in locations where a fixed installation is not an option. “Exorac-based systems are suitable for use in the military, to preserve freedom of movement, and in emergency response to quickly deploy a reliable energy source that is not dependent on supply logistics, as is the case with diesel for example,” Albertella further explained.
The mobility of PV implies a good compromise between the costs and weight of the components, he added. “The heavier the modules, the stronger and more expensive the support structure must be. Therefore traditional modules, which are cheap but heavy, may be a less good choice than lightweight modules, which are more expensive but have lower racking costs.”
PWRstation has decided to adopt lightweight and powerful semi-rigid modules and has adapted them to its products in order to achieve the maximum degree of integration and optimization.
The Swiss start-up has also developed a small six-module unit, called Veetoo, which is intended for use in military deployments of semi-permanent installations of unlimited size or for flat roofs in commercial and industrial applications. “These small six-module units can be folded up in the blink of an eye, allowing for roof maintenance or even total re-roofing, without having to dismantle the PV system,” Albertella emphasized. “More than half of the commercial and industrial roofs are still left unused because of their age, which is an obstacle for non-folding racking systems.”

The company's main markets are island regions such as the Caribbean for containerized and hurricane-resistant solutions. For the Veetoo product, the US market for commercial and industrial installations with capacities between 300 kW and 2-3 MW is the primary target.
PWRstation has already sold its systems to companies such as Schneider Electric, humanitarian organizations such as UNHCR and delivered a donation installation to Iniciativa Comunitaria in San-Juan (PR) in partnership with Schneider Electric and local partners.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/28/solar-catamaran-100-powered-by-heterojunction-modules/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RUSSIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 28, 2021",Solar catamaran 100% powered by heterojunction modules,"A catamaran designed by English racer and engineer Phil Morrison and set to undertake a 100-day solo transatlantic trip from Chile to Australia will be exclusively powered by a PV power generator.
The boat will be helmed by Russian adventurer and survivalist Fedor Konyukhov in a first-ever solo transpacific 9,000 nautical mile expedition from Chile to Australia, which is set to start in December.
Called Nova, the vessel is 11m long, 7m wide and able to reach speeds of 5-7 knots. It is made of carbon-fiber composites and weighs only 2.2 tons. “The craft is designed to break down into two hulls and four deck sections, which together with ancillary equipment, launching and assembly, will fit into two 40ft containers,” Morrison said in a statement.
The boat is equipped with an 11 kW PV system built with flexible heterojunction solar panels developed by Russian module maker Hevel Solar. “The cost of solar elements plus labor and without the storage system was RUB 1.1 million, which makes up to €12,000,” a spokesperson from the manufacturer told pv magazine.
The solar array will cover a surface of around 66 m2 on the vessel and the sides of the hull will also carry panels, providing an additional 12m2 per side. “Whilst these panels are not expected to be as efficient as the deck panels it is hoped they will gather valuable additional energy when the sun is low on the horizon and from light reflected off the water surface,” Hevel Solar explained.
The PV system will also ensure the supply of freshwater, as the boat is equipped with a desalination system powered by solar-generated electricity itself.
The catamaran is also equipped with an energy storage system designed by Enel X, a unit of Italian utility Enel. The system relies on 26 Li-Fe-phosphate batteries to ensure a stable power supply for the PV system, which could peak in excess of 5 kW in ideal conditions. “Sophisticated MPPT charge controllers capable of adjusting the current and voltage to maximize the charging potential will be allied with a complex monitoring system allowing the craft to optimize the power obtained,” Morrison stated.
Nova is claimed to be able to navigate with full autonomy in the ocean for up to six months.
The boat was also conceived with technologies provided by Mikhail Lifshitz, general designer at ROTEC JSC, which specializes in developing methods to power sea and river vessels using electricity-supplied engines, solar panels and the albedo effect.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/28/methylammonium-free-perovskite-solar-cell-with-slot-die-coating-18-efficiency/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SINGAPORE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 28, 2021","Methylammonium-free perovskite solar cell with slot-die coating, 18% efficiency","Scientists from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and Université Grenoble Alpes in France have combined a slot-die coating technique with gas quenching and substrate heating to fabricate a perovskite solar cell with an active area of over 0.09 cm2 and a power conversion efficiency of 18%.
Gas quenching is used primarily in connection with hardening in vacuum furnaces and slot-die coating is a process already used in various industries. Ink is pushed through a narrow slot as it moves across a substrate to form a continuous film. Substrate heating is commonly applied in the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) process.
These techniques, which the researchers described as a combined “synergistic crystallization strategy,” was used to coat a methylammonium-free perovskite film with a thickness of around 500 nm over a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate of 10 × 10 cm2 without the use of solvents or additives.
The perovskite precursor ink was prepared in a nitrogen-filled glovebox by mixing lead(II) iodide (PbI2), formamidinium iodide (FAI), lead(II) bromide (PbBr2), and cesium iodide (CsI).
“The solution was kept at 40 C under stirring overnight and transferred to the slot-die tubing system the next day,” the scientists said. “For the perovskite module fabrication, P2 scribing was performed with a CO2 laser with adjusted power to remove specifically the perovskite and the hole transport layers and a manual P3 step was performed by Kapton tape masking.”
The cell has an ‘n-i-p' layout and is composed of the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, a Tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) layer, the perovskite film, a layer made of gold (Au). It also has a spiro-OMeTAD hole-blocking layer, which is typically used as a hole transport material for solid-state dye solar cells and perovskite devices.
The best performing slot-die coated solar cell showed an efficiency of 18.03%, an open-circuit voltage of 1024 mV, a fill factor of 78.6% and short-circuit current density of 22.4 mA cm−2.
“The device performance reproducibility was assessed by fabricating 30 devices from the same substrate,” the academics said, adding that their average efficiency was 16.35%.
They described the cell and the related production process in “Slot-die coated methylammonium-free perovskite solar cells with 18% efficiency,” which was recently published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.
“This work provides an insight into the processing window for perovskite meniscus coating and paves the way toward large-scale processing of MA-free perovskites,” the researchers said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/28/pv-sweeps-greeces-350-mw-tender-with-record-e0-03297-kwh-tariff/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,GREECE",ILIAS TSAGAS,"MAY 28, 2021",PV sweeps Greece’s 350 MW tender with country record €0.03297/kWh tariff,"Greece’s latest renewable energy tender took place on May 24 for solar and wind power technologies. The country’s energy regulator, RAE, said yesterday that tariffs ranged from €0.03297/kWh to €0.0512kWh, with the average tariff coming in at €0.0376/kWh.
Only PV projects up to 20 MW and wind power projects no larger than 50 MW were allowed in the Greek auction. The tender’s lowest tariff was awarded to a 19.3 MW solar farm, which is set to be developed by local firm Egnatia. Overall, the company, part of the Athens-headquartered Mytilineos Group, won around 130 MW of the awarded capacity. Ecosolar won another 90 MW worth of solar PV capacity.
The regulator did not initially state whether the winning capacity comprised solar or wind power projects; however today it has updated its press release stating that only PV projects were successful. This development is in line with results seen in other European tenders, where PV projects also swept the board.
Commenting on the tender results, Greece’s minister of the environment and energy Kostas Skrekas expressed confidence that the country can hit its target of generating at least 61% of its electricity mix by renewables by 2030.
He also remarked that the auction prices that enable solar power investments at one third of the lignite power plants, show that Greece’s coal phase out makes economic sense.
The main reason behind Greece’s last successful tender is the 2020 reform of the country’s licensing regime. The previous regime required Greece’s energy regulator to process all projects’ generation licenses – a prerequisite for projects to bid on the tenders. However, the regulator was incapable of processing the backlog of applications, which exceeded 6 GW of capacity.
This led to just a few projects acquiring a generation license, meaning most Greek tenders were undersubscribed and failed to allocate the full amount of power capacity sought.
Following last year’s policy reform, investors only need a so-called license certificate, which can be applied for online, via a digitized process. The policy reform requires RAE to issue the certificate within 20 days of receipt of a €60 application fee from developers.
The result is that where all previous tenders were undersubscribed, this week’s tender saw 126 projects totaling 1,090 MW of capacity competing against each other for a total of 350 MW of contracts.
The high level of competition and the clever diminishing of the regulator’s role in the licensing process bore the fruits of record low auction tariffs.
Greece’s energy ministry understands very well that should Greece achieve its decarbonization targets and attract investors, this is the direction future policies must also take.
The second round of reforms, set to be announced this summer, will bring another blow to the country’s red tape by uniting all licensing under one digital roof. Investors will be able to apply and manage the complete licensing of their projects via one central platform.
Overall, Greece aims to auction a further 2.1 GW of solar and wind power capacities by 2024.

Godawari Power & Ispat Ltd, an Indian integrated steelmaker, will set up a 250 MW solar plant in Raigarh district, in the Indian state of Chhattisgarh. 
The solar project will be built on 362 hectares acquired by the company in the fiscal 2011-12 period. It will be commissioned by December 2022. The power will replace high-cost thermal and grid power, and will be used for the company’s existing factory in the state's Raipur district.  
Currently, Godawari Power & Ispat Limited’s steel plant has a captive power generation capacity of 73 MW, including 42 MW of captive energy from waste heat recovery, 11 MW from a coal-fired thermal power plant, and 20 MW from biomass power capacity.
Additionally, it gets 25 MW from a coal-fired thermal power plant operated by its Jagdamba Power unit and 50 MW from a solar thermal power plant in Rajasthan to meet its electricity needs.

The mining sector has utilized large off-grid captive solutions for many years. Indeed, a mine needs several MW to run its operations, but it must be differentiated from current projects related to small to medium enterprises (SMEs), shopping malls or the agricultural industry. The size of these projects ranges between a few hundred kilowatts to a few megawatts.
The objective is to be below the capacity limit that requires a specific legal framework, which facilitates a project’s development. For example, in Kenya, the Energy Act 2019 enables power producers below 1 MW to sell energy without following the stringent licensing process.
Before providing an overview of the different stakeholder profiles, it is important to describe the two main implementation models.
Even if the direct purchase model is still dominant, the ESCO model is increasingly present through the investment of various new stakeholders specialized in project finance that identify the C&I sector as a priority.
This range of stakeholders highlights two important motivations about the current sector trends:
However, despite the growing investments in captive solar solutions, the sector continues to face several challenges that hinder its development. They include:
For countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to be industrialized and attain economic prosperity, there is a need for C&I consumers to have access to cheap and reliable power. As such, it is imperative for the governments to (i) implement an operating and legal framework to do so; and (ii) put in place favorable policies and incentives that encourage private sector investment in captive solar solutions.

“Solar PV installed capacity has been increasing by 1 GW per quarter since 2020 until now, so this growth is not that remarkable — and it's still insufficient to achieve the Korean government's goal of 20% renewable generation by 2030,” Kyungrak Kwon, renewables program director at Seoul-based NGO Solutions for Our Climate, told pv magazine.
According to a recent study by Solutions for Our Climate and the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology, in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, the target to reach 20% renewables from total generation by 2030 must be raised to 40%, and installed renewables capacity needs to increase sevenfold by that year. “What's more, the issue of delayed solar PV connections to the grid has yet to be resolved, thus, preventing the timely, sufficient addition of solar PV supply,” Kwon further explained.
If the growth trend of the first quarter is confirmed for the rest of the year, South Korea may reach or exceed last year's newly installed PV capacity of 4,126 MW, a result that was not only comparatively higher than the 3.8 GW in 2019 and 2.4 GW in 2018, but also made 2020 the most successful year ever recorded by the country.
At the end of March, the country's cumulative installed PV capacity reached around 15.5 GW.
South Korea currently plans to install 30.8 GW of solar by 2030. This ambitious target is expected to be achieved by building giant solar parks such as a 2.1 GW floating solar project and a 3 GW ground-mounted PV array that was announced for the Saemangeum area by South Korean president Moon Jae-in in November 2018.
More recently, the South Korean government announced a plan to add another 2.1 GW of floating PV by 2030. Furthermore, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) is planning to allocate around 4 GW of solar capacity this year across two PV tenders, one of which was launched in late April.

India added 2,056 MW of solar in the January-February-March period of 2021, a 37% increase over Q4 2020. Installations were up 88% year-on-year, compared to 1,090 MW added in Q1 2020, according to Mercom‘s CY Q1 2021 India Solar Market Update. 
Cumulative solar installations in India reached 41 GW (35.5 GW large-scale and 5.4 GW rooftop) as of March 31, representing 10.7% of the nation’s total installed power capacity. 
Out of the 2,056 MW installed in the first quarter, 1,749 MW came from utility-scale projects and 307 MW from rooftop solar. 
The states of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh led the way in installations, followed by Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh. 
According to the report, solar installations improved considerably in Q1 2021, with developers completing their delayed projects from last year. Rooftop solar adoption surged as the commercial and industrial sector looked for ways to cut costs during challenging market conditions. 
The large-scale project pipeline stood at 53.6 GW, with another 24.1 GW of projects tendered and pending auctions as of Q1 2021. 
The report expects the annual solar installation to be hit significantly as project timelines get extended due to the second wave of Covid. It forecasts about 7 GW PV installation in 2021 under a medium-case scenario for the Covid impact.  
“With the second wave of the pandemic hitting the country, the industry is battling solar component price increases and volatility,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group. “Even more concerning is the uncertainty in procurement as shortages are widespread. Policy restrictions and duties have added to the rising costs and unpredictability.”
“Due to the targeted lockdowns, this time around, disruptions and labor issues are not as widespread as last year. However, most of the lockdowns are in important solar states like Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh which will significantly impact installation totals this year,” Prabhu added.

In order to clean the U.S. power grid, wind, solar and energy storage professionals will need to deploy more than a terawatt of additional clean electricity capacity.
No problem, drill sergeant! The developers are at the ready!
According to power plant waiting lists around the country, more than half of the generation we need is already in queue. But curb your enthusiasm: The power grid isn’t yet ready to take on these projects, and many of them won’t be built.
What matters most is not the low rate of project completion, but that this emerging data sends the signal that developers have already completed reconnaissance on more than half the sites needed to reach our clean electricity goals.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s Electricity Markets and Policy Group at Berkeley Lab (EMP) has released new data tools that summarize the proposed projects in the nation’s power grid interconnection queues. The queues represent 85% of the country’s electricity sales.
Included within this release is a data-rich interactive tool, a graphic slide deck discussion, and the cumulative queue data itself. The key figures show that we have more than 750 GWac of electricity generation capacity in the queue, and 90% of that is clean energy-related.
More recently, added capacities from renewable electricity sources have completely dominated the queue. The chart below was taken from the interactive data tool. It shows that gas represents the only fossil capacity added since 2016. Solar and solar+battery dominated new capacity in 2020.

With a total of 462 GWac, solar accounts for the largest share of generator capacity in the queues. Applying the standard 1.25 module-to-inverter ratio results in 577 GWdc of solar capacity. Currently, installed U.S. solar capacity is just over 100 GWdc.
Wind, at 209 GWac, represents the second-largest capacity volume in the queue. Offshore wind represents 61 GWac of that amount, having started from almost zero last year.
With both the east and west coasts embracing offshore wind, and with technological advancements like floating wind, we could hypothetically power the whole of the United States. Expect this capacity to grow massively in future reports.
And while there is no nuclear, coal, or “other” capacity to speak of, there is 74 GWac of natural gas capacity in the queue. pv magazine USA has reported that while substantial volumes of new fossils are built annually, there has been zero net new fossil capacity since the mid 2000s. New gas capacity primarily replaces dirtier, less flexible, and more expensive coal capacity.
Energy storage volume
In addition to the generation hardware, the queue now holds greater than 200 GW of energy storage. The capacity value – the number of consecutive hours that 200 GW can be delivered  – is not yet publicly available. The greatest number of projects may involve four-hour batteries, but there are many shapes and sizes in our current market.
The real energy storage story isn’t volume, but rate of growth. At the end of 2019, storage power capacity stood at 50 GW. By the end of 2020, that number had ballooned to 400%.
A little over half of all energy storage capacity is coupled with solar and wind power. A recent analysis by the EMP team suggests that there would be significantly less coupling without the IRS’s Investment Tax Credit, which applies to batteries when they’re paired with solar.
The absolute volume of energy storage in the queue is probably between 400 and 800 GWh. That might seem small compared to full-year electricity use of 4,000,000 GWh. However, that potential 800 GWh provides nearly two of the 12 hours of energy storage that is needed for the U.S. power grid to reach 80% wind plus solar.
Remember, although we can meet U.S. electricity needs with a 100 km x 100 km square placed out in the desert, we don’t need to. In addition to eye-popping utility scale capacity volumes, we are also seeing significant volumes of solar built on residential and commercial rooftops.
For instance, New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Virginia all have solar power programs deploying systems up to 5 MWac. The queue data from EMP shows fewer than a dozen 5 MWac projects in Pennsylvania, while is now at least 1 GW of projects submitted.
Furthermore, every single year we install a growing volume of residential and nonresidential (commercial) projects. These two segments on their own just broke 5 GWdc for the first time in 2020. Projected out, that would  mean adding more than 100 GW by 2035.
Two documents, – a 2030 analysis calculating what’s needed to meet our goal of an 80% clean power grid, and the Biden administration’s 2035 goal of a 90% clean power grid – suggest that we need 950 GW and 1,100 GW, respectively, of solar and wind capacity.
The EMP queue volumes today represent 61% and 71%, respectively, of the capacity required to hit those 2030 and 2035 targets. The largest developers know that much of what is in their queue today won’t be built by then; however, there’s a long way to go.
NextEra – one of the largest solar developers in the United States, and possibly the largest member of the queue – has stated in quarterly financial earnings calls that there is much more development capacity potential in its pipeline than the gigawatts disclosed in its quarterly earnings reports. This capacity will be unlocked, the company said, when and if financial and political conditions support it.
Considering that President Biden announced a federal goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035, along with a clean energy standard, we should expect to see queue numbers continue to grow. If projected submission-to-completion rates remain as low as they currently are, then we should expect to see truly massive volumes – terawatt plus – enter the queue.
What actually gets built … well, that’s yet to be determined.

The Turkish authorities allocated all the capacity they planned to assign through the tender and selected projects with a size ranging from 10 to 20 MW.
The lowest price in the procurement exercise was TRY 0.182 ($0.021)/kWh and the highest TRY 32.0 ($0.037)/kWh. “Thanks to local and international investors' huge interest we’ve witnessed a fierce competition,” Eren Engur, a board member of Turkish solar association Günder and president of its Energy Storage Committee, told pv magazine.
The selected projects will have to be built with 70% of solar modules manufactured in Turkey. “There are more than 40 local PV module manufacturers in Turkey and some of them have been doing OEM for global Top 10 and Tier-1 suppliers for many years already,” Eren explained. “And there are already some Tier-1 brands manufacturing in Turkey and we see serious intention from other players to place local manufacturing in the country to benefit from a market that can reach 1.5 GW per year.”
The solar plants will be located in 36 cities and across 74 grid connection points. The following cities have been allocated projects under the tender: Adıyaman, Ağrı, Aksaray, Ankara, Antalya, Batman, Bayburt, Bilecik, Bingöl, Bitlis, Burdur, Bursa, Çankırı, Çorum, Diyarbakır, Elazığ, Erzurum, Eskişehir, Gaziantep, Hakkari, Iğdır, Kahramanmaraş, Kars, Kırşehir, Kilis, Malatya, Mardin, Mersin, Muş, Nevşehir, Osmaniye, Siirt, Şırnak, Uşak, Van and Yozgat.
“We’re so delighted with the outcome of this tender, along with the recently announced regulations for energy storage ,” Engur stated. Another 1 GW tender — the YEKA-4 — will be announced within two months and may include the planned allocation of around 300 MWh of storage, he added.
Turkey reached 7,065.4 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of April. The Solar Energy Roadmap report published by Günder in 2019 predicted the nation could install 38 GW of solar by 2030. A separate study, published by the Istanbul-based Shura Energy Transition Center, in May 2018, had predicted solar could pass 20 GW by 2026.

That was one of the trends to emerge from the latest six-month report issued by Amsterdam-based off-grid organization GOGLA and the World Bank's Lighting Global program.
The latest edition of the biannual Global Off-grid Solar Market Report estimated 33.66 MW of solar generation capacity was deployed worldwide from July last year, in the form of off-grid systems such as lanterns, fans, TVs and fridges, as well as multiple-appliance solar home systems.
GOGLA, formerly known as the Global Off-grid Lighting Association, noted a rise in sales of 50-100 Wp solar home systems as wealthier households moved to shore up grid power supply during the pandemic and speculated tighter family finances during lockdowns explained a shift from cash-up-front purchases to pay-as-you-go finance. The report also pointed to the effect of conflict between the Ethiopian government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front, given the importance of the off-grid market in Tigray, which is attempting to break away from Addis Ababa.
The statistics showed a recovery of sorts after the initial ravages of the pandemic in the first half of last year, with 3.6 million solar lighting product sales up 19% from the January-to-June period but down 18% on the second half of the previous year. The nascent market for non-lighting appliances held steady at around 470,000 sales with the report adding it had been expected to expand last year, before the pandemic hit.
The uneven nature of the recovery was illustrated in sub-Saharan Africa, with solar lighting sales that were down 4% from the second half of 2019 overall featuring a fall of 10% in East Africa, the biggest regional market, but rising 19% in West Africa and a notable 40% in central Africa. By contrast, non-lighting appliance sales slumped 32% in the central region during the second half of last year, with the retreat only 11% in West Africa and 5% in the eastern region. The report also noted rising sales of ‘extra large' solar powered TVs across East and West Africa, reflecting advances in energy efficiency for such products over smaller screens.
Policy support for off-grid solar in Somalia and Nigeria – the latter badly hit by Covid cases and the oil price plunge – was balanced by reverses in Uganda, caused by extreme weather events; Zambia, where companies were forced to make retroactive import payments for historic shipments; and Ethiopia, where the coffers of the World Bank-funded Development Bank of Ethiopia had been almost exhausted in 2019.
The study also highlighted the detrimental effect on off-grid appliance sales in Kenya after Covid expenses forced the government to rescind an exemption from VAT for such products. A similar, regional move saw the six-nation East African Community remove an exception from import duties for solar goods.
In South Asia, solar lighting sales tumbled 43%, from the second half of 2019, mainly because of the effects of the pandemic in India. A lack of micro finance in India worsened the picture, after the government failed to extend a three-month Covid-related repayment holiday for bank borrowers to micro finance customers. With sales tumbling, a third of South Asian retailers who provided information for the update reported figures down more than 50% during the six-month window.
The study also includes the East Asian and Pacific off-grid appliance market and the report's authors said global investment in the sector held firm during 2020, at $316 million, but that figure included a 46% fall in equity investments into provider companies.
Calling for immediate provision of more grant and concessional finance for off-grid solar, GOGLA and its partners said the advent of Covid-19 across markets last year had deprived 10-15 million people, and 300,000-450,000 enterprises, of improved energy access.
The market report was produced by GOGLA, the World Bank, clean energy appliance NGO Efficiency for Access, U.K. government body UK Aid and Dutch consultancy Berenschot.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/28/getting-australias-hydrogen-economy-right/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 28, 2021",Getting Australia’s hydrogen economy right,"From pv magazine Australia
Hydrogen – the universe’s smallest molecule today holds perhaps its loftiest promise. However, the energy transition needs to be thoughtfully designed. Nicky Ison, WWF Australia’s energy transition manager, tells pv magazine Australia about four things that need attention to safeguard the emerging hydrogen economy and ensure it begins clean.
1. Stop using colors
“There’s fossil fuel hydrogen and renewable hydrogen, and that’s the least confusing way of describing it,” Ison says, plainly.
Currently, the vocabulary around hydrogen’s origin is explained by a rainbow of colours, from green to blue to gray to brown. It’s confusing for people in the industry, let alone laypeople. In fact, former Australian Prime Minister Malcom Turnbull also brought up the issue of hydrogen’s many colors at the Smart Energy Conference earlier this month, saying that “green hydrogen is the only type of hydrogen we should be planning for.”
Turnbull flatly called “BS” 0n “blue hydrogen,” or hydrogen produced with fossil fuels where emissions are supposedly offset by carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. “There is no other color [other than green] of hydrogen that you can responsibly support,” he said.
The Smart Energy Council is working on this specific issue. It introduced a Zero Carbon Certification Scheme to guarantee that hydrogen and all its subsidiary materials are made completely from renewable energy.
2. Public money for renewable hydrogen
The reason, Ison says, is that hydrogen produced using fossil fuels simply doesn’t hold any promise for a cost curve reduction, since it is a mature industry. Renewable hydrogen, on the other hand, will inevitably drop in price significantly through economies of scale.
While renewable hydrogen is still significantly more expensive to produce today, Ison points back to 2009, when there was a huge cost difference between solar electricity and traditional electricity.  Government backing of solar quickly closed that gap, getting Australia to where it is today. Like wind and solar, the electroyzers used to make renewable hydrogen are a modular technology, which means they will follow a similar trajectory down in terms of cost, especially with government backing.
The other reason that public money should be more shrewdly spent is, of course, to reach climate targets.
“We should not be investing in technologies that are not zero emissions,” Ison tells pv magazine Australia.
3. Decarbonize the hydrogen industry
Global hydrogen accounts for 1% of greenhouse gas emissions, so decarbonizing the existing industry should be top priority, Ison says.

Around 98% of the hydrogen produced today uses fossil fuels in its production. This accounts for more CO2 emissions per year than the global aviation industry and global shipping, according to Wood Mackenzie. This, Ison says, makes it clear that hydrogen’s greening process needs to begin at home in the existing hydrogen industry.
4. Focus on industrial processes
Renowned journal Nature caused a stir when it published a piece from a German-Swiss research team concluding that the use of hydrogen-based fuels should be prioritized in sectors that are difficult to electrify, such as long-distance aviation, feedstocks in chemical production, steel production and high-temperature industrial processes.
“Hydrogen as a universal climate solution might be a bit of false promise,” it said.
Ison largely agrees. She says the focus should be on integrating hydrogen where it’s needed most, not in areas where electrification is already established and working well, such as electric vehicles.

“Renewable hydrogen is absolutely essential for decarbonisation, but we shouldn’t waste it on processes where we could use renewable electricity directly,” Ison said.
If we focus on industrial applications, Australia will be able to export hydrogen, probably in the form of ammonia, Ison says. “But the biggest opportunity is actually is on-shoring industrial processes.”
Role reversal
Our incumbent system is based on the characteristics of fossil fuels – which are expensive produce, but exceedingly cheap and easy to transport. Renewable energy, on the other hand, is cheap to produce, but costly and difficult to transport.
If the ease of fossil fuel transportation meant manufacturing and industry could be pushed offshore where labor is cheaper, this model loses its legs as the world decarbonizes. This shifts the foundational nature of the industrial sector globally.
Like the authors of the Grattan Institute’s ‘Start with steel’ paper, Ison says this shifts holds a lot of potential for Australia. By bringing industrial processes like steelmaking and ammonia production back onshore, Australia could drive a manufacturing boom, she says.
