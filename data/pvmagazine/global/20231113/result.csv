https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/13/mhelios-energy-management-system-makes-european-debut-at-solar-and-storage-live-2023/,"SPONSORED,EUROPE",,"NOVEMBER 13, 2023",MHELIOS energy management system makes European debut at Solar and Storage Live 2023,"Global leading smart home appliances manufacturer Midea brought its MHELIOS energy management system to Europe for the first time at Solar and Storage Live 2023 in Birmingham, United Kingdom. The Midea Home Energy Linkage Inverter Optimization System (MHELIOS) provides an all-in-one service for managing home energy use.
MHELIOS has advanced DC power architecture, allowing it to store power from photovoltaics without AC conversion losses, according to the manufacturer. The smart energy manager maximizes the use of solar power with 98.2% efficiency, while supporting flexible capacity expansion ranging from 5 kWh to 40 kWh.
With a 10 ms switching time, MHELIOS provides backup performance to ensure users  won’t be caught without power during sudden blackouts or power grid outages. The solution is more than an energy converter, as it enables intelligent control of not only solar power and energy storage, but also heat pumps and HVAC, representing a single, centralized place for homeowners to manage all these systems together.
Midea says MHELIOS is effectively plug and play, with quick installation. Additionally, owners can manage the system via an app on their smartphone, which allows them to monitor their energy use in real-time.
Midea designed MHELIOS to be part of a wider household energy-saving ecosystem that includes high-efficiency heating and cooling systems. The company’s aim is to promote a closed loop between power generation, power storage, and power consumption that is efficient, intelligent, and reliable. MHELIOS made its official debut in China earlier in 2023.
Midea’s ESS regional sales director, Dooriya Wu, said, “Heating and cooling can account for around 78% of household bills in Europe. We want to make energy storage and PV a central part of the economy so that the consumer pays less, while also not adding to the burden on the environment.” Euromonitor International recently recognized Midea as the world’s top residential inverter air conditioner company, as well as the highest-ranked R290 air conditioner company in terms of sales volume in 2022.
Midea’s vision is to build a green global supply chain. The company has expressed the desire to collaborate with solar and EV companies as partners to offer clients and consumers smart options for maximizing their energy use.
Solar and Storage Live annually brings together tens of thousands of representatives from the energy industry’s key businesses seeking to lead the UK’s transition to cleaner and more efficient energy production, which is why Midea chose the event to showcase the MHELIOS solution. From 28-30 November 2023, Midea will also participate in Enlit Europe in Paris, France, with the company’s advanced MHELIOS solution.

Message framing consists of a series of techniques that helps the receivers interpret what they see or what they are being told and is commonly used to send a message to a specific audience while advocating health perceptions and behaviors.
“Our study primarily examined how retailers can boost solar panel demand,” the research's lead author, Dominik Bär, told pv magazine. “However, fostering solar panel installation involves considering the broader market context. A combination of public policies, financial incentives, and effective communication strategies, like those explored in our study, are critical in encouraging private households to invest in green technologies.”
Behavioral responses
The research group presented the approach in the paper “Message framing to promote solar panels,” published in nature communications, where it explained that message framing refers to a kind of communication that typically provides a scalable and cost-efficient approach to induce certain behavioral responses.
The scientists also explained that previous literature tended to create an opposition between economic gains and environmental concerns in convincing consumers to buy a photovoltaic system and opted, instead, for a strategy using both arguments. “We propose messages designed to promote a serious commitment of retail consumers to adopt solar panels by targeting themselves or the environment,” they stated.
Loss vs. earnings
The group explained, for example, that messages focusing on self-interests should take into account the opposition between cost savings and additional earnings, and said that the concept of savings is associated with the idea of avoiding a “loss,” which may trigger stronger behavioral reactions compared to the idea of “earning” something.
“We thus test whether the following two messages promote solar panels: (1) Self-Save: “Save on average € 813 per year” and (2) Self-Earn: “Earn on average € 813 per year,” the academics explained.
CO2 emissions vs. green power
The researchers also investigated the opposition between a message seeking to convince consumers to buy a PV system to reduce CO2 emissions, which they said is intended to avoid environmental harm, and another one inviting them to produce clean electricity, which emphasizes a positive environmental achievement.
“Previous research showed that preventing a negative environmental outcome may be a stronger incentive to adopt environmentally friendly behavior but again outside of large-scale investments,” they also explained.
Testing
The team tested these arguments with the support of an undisclosed “leading” online retailer from the Netherlands during a study period of 14 days. The company's website showed visiting customers one of four messages in a call-to-action box.
Through their analysis, the researchers found that all proposed messages effectively promote solar panels with a 3.8% higher rate of customers committing to solar panels compared to the two weeks before the experiment.
They also found that the Self-Save frame achieved the highest rate, followed by the Self-Earn frame at 4.17%. The Environment CO2 nd Environment Green frames achieved 4.12% and 3.98%, respectively.
“Our study primarily examined how retailers can boost solar panel demand,” Bär said. “However, fostering solar panel installation involves considering the broader market context. A combination of public policies, financial incentives, and effective communication strategies, like those explored in our study, are critical in encouraging private households to invest in green technologies.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/13/new-dichalcogenide-solar-cell-architecture-promises-25-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 13, 2023",New dichalcogenide solar cell architecture promises 25% efficiency,"Researchers from Stanford University have demonstrated a 50 nm single-junction transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) solar cell that could potentially achieve a 25% power conversion efficiency.
“We developed a rigorous model for TMD solar cell performance which accounts for both intrinsic and extrinsic factors like material quality, and therefore examines the true performance limits of TMD solar cells, feasible via design optimization, as a function of thickness and material quality,” researcher Koosha Nassiri Nazif told pv magazine.
They structured the device with a multilayer absorber based on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), tungsten disulfide (WS2), and tungsten diselenide (WSe2). The four materials have energy bandgaps of 1.27 eV, 1.16 eV, 1.36 eV, and 1.29 eV, respectively.
“Due to their large absorption coefficients and refractive indices, all these TMDs exhibit significant light absorptance even in ultrathin films of 5 nm thickness,” the researchers said. “As expected from their exceptional light absorption characteristics, all TMDs can achieve high short-circuit current even at small thicknesses.”
The scientists also placed an anti-reflection coating on the cell's front surface and a perfect back-reflector on the rear side. They also assumed the surfaces to be textured non-specular and to be created by etching, which they said leads to randomized light and angle-independent absorption.
Simulated under standard illumination conditions, the proposed cell architecture was able to achieve efficiencies of up to 25%.
“We showed that ultrathin TMD solar cells as thin as 50 nm can achieve 25% power conversion efficiency even with today’s material quality,” co-researcher Eric Pop said. “This corresponds to approximately ten times higher specific power than incumbent solar technologies in the form of fully packaged cells and around five times higher than specific power in fully packaged modules.”
The academics introduced their findings in “Efficiency limit of transition metal dichalcogenide solar cells,” which was recently published in Communication Physics.
The same research group fabricated in 2021 a flexible metal dichalcogenide solar cell with 5.1% efficiency. The device achieved a power-per-weight ratio on par with well-established thin-film technologies such as cadmium telluride (CdTe); copper, indium, gallium and selenium (CIGS); amorphous silicon (a-Si); and III-V solar cells.
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are two-dimensional materials with remarkable semiconducting properties and high optical absorption coefficients. This makes them suitable for the production of semi-transparent and flexible solar cells with potential applications in aerospace, architecture, electric vehicles, and wearable electronics, where light weight, a high power-per-weight ratio, and flexibility are very desirable.

TÜV SUD has confirmed the results.
For the same module technology, the manufacturer achieved in September an output of 744.4 W and an efficiency of 23.96%.
“This achievement is attributed to the notable progress in cell efficiency, coupled with the refinement of the polyisobutylene (PIB) and light conversion film encapsulation process,” the company said, without providing further details.
In September, the company explained that the new record was made possible by applying low-temperature silver paste with high-density fine busbar printing technology to the module production.
“We will continue to break records for module efficiency and power output after gradually introducing new technologies like metallized film and busbarless design into mass production,” it stated at the time.
In March, Huasun started making solar panels at its HJT cell factory in Xuancheng, in China's Anhui province. Currently, it has a production capacity of over 20 GW.
In the second half of 2022, Huasun launched the G12 series of HJT solar modules, with a focus on utility-scale projects.

The US Geological Survey (USGS) Energy Resources Program, in collaboration with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) Energy Markets and Policy Department, has created the US Large-Scale Solar Photovoltaic Database (USPVDB). This map, funded by the US Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office and USGS Energy Resources Program, monitors ground-mounted utility-scale solar projects larger than 1 MW (DC).
While much of this information has already existed in various government databases, the USPVDB augments that data with complementary information on the total footprint area and detailed attributes of each facility, including panel technology type, axis type, year of installation, and generation capacity.
Project site information was also added – whether it is a greenfield, or has previous, current, or suspected contamination, or if agrivoltaic. The projects were position-verified and digitized by aerial imagery, and checked for quality to verify facility locations.
The map viewer shows 3,676 total solar facilities representing 54,880 MW (AC) of generating capacity that was online before 2022. Figures from the resulting process are available for public use and are provided in multiple formats – ESRI shapefile, GeoJSON file, CSV, and XML.
The November edition of pv magazine is dominated by the issue of global oversupply and examines the effects of a solar glut in the European Union, the United States, and other markets. We turn the spotlight on PV developments in South Korea, Taiwan, and Africa and update readers on technological progress in thin films, kerfless wafering, and mass produced heterojunction PV.

They considered how to implement the biomethanation process in PV-driven operations, where activity is shut off due to the lack of solar radiation.
Biomethanation is the processing of organic materials into biogas, primarily composed of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). In this process, hydrogen gas (H2) plays a significant role as a substrate for microbial reactions and a part of the final product.
“As an alternative to battery energy storage, the utilization of solar PV energy to produce H2 by the water electrolysis process has been proposed,” the scientists explained. “H2 may be used as a building block to produce other fuels and chemicals, [such as biomethane]. Biomethane, with typical concentrations above 98 vol% CH4, is well suited for injection into natural gas grids.”
To demonstrate the feasibility of producing biomethane in discontinuous PV terms, the academics first gathered solar data from the California Flats Solar Park – a 280 MW PV plant located in Monterrey County, California.
With a nine-hour stable energy supply, the California Flats Solar Park operates with a 1.5-hour ramp-up and ramp-down, spending the remaining 12 hours in standby mode. The research group explored the use of a trickle bed reactor (TBR), a catalytic system transforming organic material into biomethane by converting sulfur, nitrogen, and aromatic compounds in hydrocarbon fuels.
They also considered a period of continuous operation of 20 days as a baseline and compared it to 29 days of discontinuous operations based on the above-mentioned plant's production profile. The scientists defined the desired fraction of H2 in biomethane to be less than 2%, as it fits natural gas grid injection.
“At the commencement of the PV-driven discontinuous operating mode, it became evident that the TBR did not achieve the same biomethanation conversion efficiency as the prior continuous mode of operation,” the academics explained. “However, after six days of following this discontinuous operating strategy, the reactor recovered to its baseline performance on day 7.”

According to academics, in the first four days of the discontinuous operation, H2 concentrations ranged from 10% to 40% in the biomethane product gas. However, by the sixth day, H2 content within the biomethane was less than 2%, as desired. Furthermore, on days seven to 12, this quality was achieved within 16 minutes after start-up; on days 13 to 21, it was achieved instantaneously; and on the last days, it was completed within 20 minutes from operation start.
“During the 12-hour standby periods, accumulated acids from the operation period degraded 58.44 % to biogas,” the scientists further explained. “Thus, the standby periods could synergistically be exploited as a clean-in-place technique to remove accumulated acids and biomass.”
Proving that the discontinuous process is feasible, the scientists propose a techno-economical evaluation. They calculated the PV-driven biomethanation plant to use an average of 28 MWh of solar PV energy daily. The electricity load for the process was calculated at 2,675.59 kW, and 2,423.07 kW of it (or 90.56%) is used for H2 production via electrolysis.
“If a pre-commercial TBR biomethanation plant is deployed at an existing biogas facility, the biomethane levelized cost of biomethane production (LCOP) in a 2030 scenario is $147.84, with electrolysis as the most significant cost contributor,” they concluded. “Although this LCOP is higher than conventional biogas upgrading, biomethanation offers the possibility of CO2 capture and utilization.”
They presented the novel system configuration in “Sunshine-to-fuel: Demonstration of coupled photovoltaic-driven biomethanation operation, process, and techno-economical evaluation,” which was recently published in Energy Conversion and Management.
