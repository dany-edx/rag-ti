The electric carmaker did not officially announce the sale to investors or the market, or mention it in its earnings call, unlike the acquisition announcement.
Instead, a press release issued by ultracapacitor company UCAP Power indicated it had purchased the “Maxwell brand [and] Maxwell Technologies Korea business, as well as other assets from Maxwell Technologies.”
Hidden in the detail was the fact Tesla has held on to key Maxwell technology, namely its dry battery electrode (DBE) process methodology.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed the sale in a series of tweets, noting the irony of selling off technology he had personally investigated. Musk said lithium-ion has Maxwell's capacitor technology “covered.”
A second tweet confirmed the dry electrode element Tesla spoke about at its Battery Day 2020, as part of a next-generation 4680 cell design the company is working on bringing to market.
Dry electrode is a key piece (one of many pieces) of the puzzle for lowering cost of lithium batteries.
That said, it has required an *immense* amount of engineering to take Maxwell’s proof-of-concept to high-quality, volume production & we’re still not quite done.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 21, 2021

Musk, in a podcast hosted by Third Row Tesla in January last year, had said ultra-capacitors were unnecessary for electric vehicles.
At the time of the podcast, Musk said his company was looking at “several” of Maxwell’s battery technologies, including the dry electrode process:
“It’s kind of a big deal. Maxwell has a bunch of technologies that, if they are applied in the right way, I think can have a very big impact.”
In response to a direct question in the podcast, Musk confirmed dry electrode technology could be a “bigger deal than it may seem.”
DBE is a solvent-free coating technology process for anodes and cathodes. It offers high energy density cells while reportedly not compromising physical properties and electrochemical performance, as well as better discharge rates, according to the Dry Electrode Coating Technology paper submitted by Maxwell Technologies to the Power Sources Conference in 2018.
That academic paper stated the process is better for the environment than conventional approaches as it reduces CO2 emissions, eliminates the use of toxic solvents, and reduces drying complexities.
Tesla's apparent aim is to use DBE as part of the 4680 battery, one of a host of technologies with the cell that it and partners Panasonic and LG are working towards commercializing. The initial usage would be for its electric vehicles, including the Model Y, Cybertruck and Tesla Semi, with large-scale Megapack storage possible at a later stage.
In its second-quarter financial results, Tesla updated on its progress with the 4680 cells, which continue to get nearer volume production:
We have successfully validated performance and lifetime of our 4680 cells produced at our Kato facility in California. We are nearing the end of manufacturing validation at Kato: field quality and yield are at viable levels and our focus is now on improving the 10% of manufacturing processes that currently bottleneck production output. While substantial progress has been made, we still have work ahead of us before we can achieve volume production. Internal crash testing of our structural pack architecture with a single-piece front casting has been successful.
Tesla has in the past said it aims to achieve 4680 battery production goals of 100 GWh by 2023, and 3,000 GWh by 2030, in a bid to reduce the cost per kilowatt-hour of the product.
UCAP Power was formed in 2019, after the Tesla acquisition of Maxwell Technologies, with staff of the latter business starting the ultracapacitor venture, including CEO Gordon Schenk, and general manager Troy Brandon. UCAP is a portfolio company of Californian non-profit tech incubator EvoNexus.

Australian iron ore company Fortescue Metals has signed an agreement with Indian industrial conglomerate JSW Group to explore green hydrogen project deployment in India. A statement about the arrangement, issued yesterday, said the partners would consider renewable hydrogen production and its use in steel making, hydrogen mobility, green ammonia and “other mutually agreed industrial applications in India.”
Four hydrogen-related projects are among 32 which will receive a slice of a €118 million EU funding pot, it was announced this week. One Spanish recipient is aiming to use gasification cracking and pyrolysis to produce 1,600 tons per year of hydrogen from 12,000 tons of municipal rubbish. “The upgrading and combination of state-of-the-art gasification technologies for the cracking and pyrolysis employed to produce hydrogen represent the innovative elements of the project,” said a summary of the project published by the European Commission on Tuesday.
A second project in Spain aims to use photoelectrocatalytic technology to directly use solar energy to electrolyze green hydrogen without any external energy input. A third project, in Valcamonica, in the eastern Lombardy region of Italy, will use what was labeled ‘green hydrogen' generated from a waste-to-energy facility to meet local industrial, logistics and transport needs, including powering trains. A project team in Poland secured funding for two polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers to produce 710 tons of green hydrogen per year with the help of a bespoke electrolyser stack which it is hoped will offer 5% energy efficiency savings.
Financial instruments dedicated to backing green hydrogen projects will be offered by EU lender the European Investment Bank (EIB) as part of a consultancy services agreement signed with industry organization Hydrogen Europe yesterday. The EIB will also offer financial advisory and technical advice to the hydrogen umbrella association as part of the deal.
French industrial gas supplier Air Liquide will build a 30 MW renewable hydrogen plant in Oberhausen, Germany, in the first project to take shape under a framework PEM electrolyzer agreement with Siemens Energy, the French partner said yesterday. Air Liquide said the initial, 20 MW phase of the project – which is being built with the help of German government funds – should be operational by early 2023. “What is unique about this project is that the electrolyzer will be integrated into the existing local [hydrogen and oxygen] pipeline infrastructure of Air Liquide to supply key industries and mobility with renewable hydrogen in one of the most industrialized regions of Germany,” said a note about the plans.
The Socar Energy Switzerland subsidiary of Azerbaijan's state energy company will work with Swiss energy services provider Alpiq and Swiss utility EW Höfe to build an electrolysis plant with a capacity of up to 10 MW in Freienbach. A statement made about the plans on Wednesday said the Swiss facility would start to be commissioned late next year and would produce 1,000-1,200 tons of green hydrogen annually for transport, with the plant's waste heat to be fed into a “regional district heating network that is currently being established.” Electrolysis will be powered by “renewables,” according to the statement.
The hydrogen produced will feed around 200 fuel-cell electric commercial vehicles, according to the project partners. The plans feature a pipe to hydrogen vehicle fueling stations at the Fuchsberg motorway services, plus a filling station at the latter site where any excess fuel can be prepared for transport to other Swiss fueling stations which are “currently being built as part of a unique, cross-sector hydrogen mobility system operated by Hydrospider, Hyundai Hydrogen Mobility and the members of the H2 Mobility Switzerland Association.”
New York State-based fuel cell vehicle company Hyzon Motors has signed a memorandum of understanding with U.S. hydrogen business RenewH2 to work on liquid hydrogen production.
“RenewH2 plans to reform biogenic methane gas to generate hydrogen,” said a press release about the agreement yesterday. “The hydrogen would then be liquefied and delivered to hydrogen fueling stations which are expected to be developed in collaboration with Hyzon. Through this collaboration, the stations can be located near Hyzon customers to help provide consistent demand.”
RenewH2 said it expects to begin production at its Wyoming facility in 2023 with an ultimate daily production capacity of 300 tons, using steam methane reformer units.
British energy company BP has joined the Center for Hydrogen Safety technical community – part of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers – as an executive member.

BHP announced on Friday it has signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Australian arm of Canadian energy major TransAlta Renewables which will allow it to build two solar farms and a battery energy storage system (BESS) to help power the mining giant’s Mt Keith and Leinster operations in Western Australia’s (WA) northern Goldfields region.
The AU$73 million (US$53.9 million) Northern Goldfields Solar Project will comprise a 27.4 MW solar farm at Mt Keith and a 10.7 MW solar farm and 10.1 MW/5.4 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) at Leinster which will displace power currently supplied by diesel and gas turbine generation.
TransAlta will build, own and operate the Northern Goldfields Solar Project which will be integrated into its 169 MW Southern Cross Energy North remote network, which currently comprises two simple-cycle power stations, each with one gas turbine.
Pick up your copy of pv magazine today for an in-depth look at solar’s vital role in securing energy supply where conventional grids have struggled to reach. And don’t miss our In Conversation special: Over the past month, we have been in touch with leading researchers working on energy systems, solar cell technologies, battery storage, hydrogen and more; discussing the future of energy and the technologies we can expect to see a whole lot more of in the coming years.
Juwi Renewable Energy, the Brisbane-based subsidiary of German company juwi, has been awarded the engineering, procurement and construction agreement for the new hybrid solar-plus-storage project.
BHP said the final notice to proceed is expected later this year with construction due to commence in early 2022. The solar farms and BESS are expected to come online in early 2023.
BHP Nickel West asset president Eddy Haegel said the project marks the first on-site solar farm and battery at any of the multinational’s global operations.
Haegel said the clean energy sources will cut emissions from electricity use at the refinery and help BHP meet its emissions reduction targets and to deliver lower carbon, sustainable nickel to its customers.
“The Northern Goldfields Solar Project will further improve our position as one of the lowest-carbon nickel miners in the world,” he said.
“It will reduce emissions from electricity use at Mt Keith and Leinster by 12%, reduce fuel costs and improve the reliability of our electricity supply with the addition of the battery storage system.”
The project is expected to reduce BHP's Scope 2 electricity greenhouse gas emissions from its Leinster and Mt Keith operations by 540,000 tons of CO2 over the first 10 years of operation.
TransAlta president Todd Stack said the project is the company’s first solar and battery storage hybrid project and signaled an expansion of its renewable generation footprint into Australia.
“This project further strengthens our existing relationship with BHP as we continue to evaluate further renewable energy opportunities and high-efficiency repowering options for our customers' operations,” he said.
“Our ability to integrate renewable energy solutions, reliably and affordably, into remote and off-grid networks uniquely positions us to enable our customers to achieve their sustainability goals.”
The project is the first renewable energy project to be developed under the PPA TransAlta, recently extended with BHP, and will have a term of 16.3 years.
BHP has also signed a PPA with Risen Energy which will see the 100 MW Merredin Solar Farm in WA supply up to 50% of the miner’s electricity needs at its Nickel West Kwinana refinery over the coming 10 years.
Nickel West’s bundled PPA (which combines tradeable large scale generation certificates with purchase of power) commenced on February 1 and will displace around 364,000 tons of CO2 over the duration of the contract, which also has an option for extension beyond its scheduled 2031 end date.
The Northern Goldfields Solar Project announcement comes just one week after BHP signed a nickel supply agreement with United States-based electric vehicles manufacturer Tesla.
That agreement will see BHP supply Tesla with nickel from its Nickel West plant, with the key metal to be used by the carmaker to manufacture electric vehicle (EV) batteries.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/30/first-solar-plans-a-3-3-gw-indian-module-fab/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",DAVID WAGMAN,"JULY 30, 2021",First Solar plans a 3.3 GW Indian module fab,"From pv magazine USA
First Solar said it plans to invest $684 million in a new, fully vertically integrated photovoltaic thin film solar module manufacturing facility in India. Contingent upon permitting, and pending approval of Indian government incentives that are satisfactory to the Arizona-based First Solar, the facility is expected to be built in the state of Tamil Nadu and commence operations in the second half of 2023.
The planned facility is projected to have a nameplate capacity of 3.3 GWdc.
First Solar produces its thin film PV modules using a fully integrated, continuous process under one roof and uses a cadmium telluride (CdTe) semiconductor.
In early June, First Solar said it would invest $680 million to expand its domestic U.S. photovoltaic solar manufacturing capacity by 3.3 GW annually, representing an implied capital expenditure of around $0.20 per watt. The company said it intended to fund construction of its third U.S. manufacturing facility in Ohio with existing cash resources.
All totaled, the company said that its nameplate manufacturing capacity will double to 16 GWdc in 2024.
In a statement, Mark Widmar, CEO, said that India offers an attractive market for First Solar in part because the company’s module technology is advantaged in a hot, humid climate. He said the country has “a well-defined goal that will need over 25 GW of solar to be deployed every year for the next nine years.”
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has projected that India will overtake the European Union (EU) to become the world’s third-largest consumer of electricity by 2030, as the country’s population and gross domestic product (GDP) continue to grow. As part of its climate targets, India has committed to ensuring that renewables will make up 40% of its energy portfolio by 2030. The country is forecast to account for almost 20% of the world’s installed solar capacity by 2040.
The facility will be designed using the manufacturing template established for First Solar’s recently-announced factory in Ohio. Combining highly skilled workers with ‘industry 4.0' architecture, machine-to-machine communication, artificial intelligence, and internet of things connectivity, it will feature high degrees of automation, precision, and continuous improvement.
The company said it continues to optimize the amount of semiconductor material used, by enhancing its vapor deposition process. First Solar also operates a recycling program that recovers more than 90% of CdTe for use in new modules.
Circular manufacturing has been the focus of one of the UP Initiative’s quarterly themes. We looked at whether adopting circular approaches can create a competitive edge and reap financial and reputational rewards, in addition to investigating what is already being done in the solar industry.
