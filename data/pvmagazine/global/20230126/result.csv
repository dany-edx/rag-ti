Six US national laboratories have described in a report how Puerto Rico could reach 40% renewable electricity by 2025, as mandated by Puerto Rico's Energy Public Policy Act, known as Act 17).
The US territory could reach 36% renewables by 2025 if 3.75 GW of utility-scale solar and 1.5 GW of storage were constructed and interconnected, which would fit a procurement mandate ordered for the local utility PREPA. It could happen as soon as year-end 2025, which would be “very rapid deployment,” the national laboratories said in a report.
To reach 40% would require an additional “hundreds of megawatts” of renewable generation, the report said, assuming a capacity factor of 20% for the initial 3.75 GW of solar.
So far, delays at multiple stages have slowed six tranches of planned renewables procurements that the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau mandated PREPA to undertake in an August 2020 order.
While the Energy Bureau’s order guided PREPA to issue requests for proposals for the first five procurements by year-end 2022, only two RFPs have been issued so far.
In the first procurement, PREPA required all bidders to submit a “best and final offer” not once, but four times, said PJ Wilson, president of the Solar and Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico. Then PREPA ultimately told bidders they had to bid a specific price of about 10.5 cents/kWh, Wilson said, adding “the whole process was unusual, drawn-out, unclear, and painful.” The Energy Bureau has hired the consulting firm Accion Group to oversee the second procurement, “and presumably” future procurements, Wilson said.
Another hurdle is that solar and storage projects approved by PREPA must also be approved by the Financial Oversight and Management Board (FOMB), a body created by a 2016 US law.
After solar projects in the first procurement earn all required approvals, there is a final step known as a “closing date.” Wilson said his understanding is that closing dates are scheduled separately for all projects and spread out over several months, and that “until the final closing contracts are signed, developers could still back out.”
As a result, the first procurement has not yet resulted in any signed contracts with the developers of 845 MW of solar projects, Wilson said. Two energy storage projects for that procurement, totaling 220 MW/880 MWh, are awaiting approval from the FOMB, he added.
For the second procurement, although no information on bids has been posted online, Wilson said “we’re hearing informally” that more than 40 bids totaling 1,800 MW of projects had been submitted.
As for the third procurement, for which the Energy Bureau had guided PREPA to issue an RFP in December 2021, the Accion Group has not yet announced when the RFP will be issued, Wilson said.
Although Puerto Rico’s Act 17 mandated that PREPA reach 20% renewables by 2022, renewables provided 3% of generation in 2022, said Marisol Bonnet, team lead for the US Department of Energy’s Puerto Rico Energy Recovery Team, during a webinar describing the report by the six national laboratories.
More key findings
Accelerated near-term deployment of utility-scale solar, land-based wind, and storage will reduce system investment and operational costs, the report said, and by 2025 these resources will cost less than just the operating costs of fossil-fueled generators. That assessment does not yet consider incentives under the US Inflation Reduction Act, which the study team will incorporate as it prepares a final study this year.
Rapid deployment of both fossil-fired and renewable generation could lead to “significant stranded assets,” cautioned the report, if distributed generation such as rooftop solar and storage eventually dominates Puerto Rico’s energy supply.
Puerto Rico could increase energy reliability and resilience to hurricanes, the report advised, with both rooftop solar plus storage, and virtual power plants that aggregate storage.
Asked on the webinar how the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s work is addressing generation shortfalls in Puerto Rico while transitioning to renewable resources, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said that “any of the generation work that FEMA adds to the system is strictly temporary, to allow emergency repairs to be made to the current system.” A nonprofit group has filed a lawsuit against FEMA under the Freedom of Information Act to disclose its funding for renewable versus fossil generation.
Wilson, whose group in Puerto Rico is a participant in the “PR100” initiative that produced the report, said the initiative is a “space for all stakeholders to join minds to define the technical pathways” for the island to reach 100% renewable electricity by 2050—the final mandate of Puerto Rico’s Act 17. The PR100 process, he said, also “encourages federal funding to align with Puerto Rico energy policy, local resilience needs and industry best practices.”

Microsoft announced it has contracted for over 2.5 GW of solar power purchase agreements (PPA) with Qcells. The partnership will tap Qcells for its solar modules, as well as engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services.
The massive power procurement by the tech giant represents the equivalent of powering over 400,000 homes. Qcells will work with Microsoft on developing the solar projects, which will advance Microsoft’s progress toward its goal of covering 100% of its energy needs with renewable energy production by 2025. It will also help support a new US-based energy supply chain.
“Building a resilient solar energy supply chain is essential to advancing a global green energy economy. Microsoft’s partnership with Qcells will help make this vision a reality by bringing innovation and investment to rural Georgia,” said Brad Smith, vice chair and president, Microsoft.
Qcells, owned by Seoul-based Hanwha Solutions, announced that it will invest more than $2.5 billion to build a complete solar supply chain in the United States, from polysilicon sourcing through module production. This will make Qcells the first company to establish a fully integrated silicon-based solar supply chain in the United States.
The company cites Senator Ossoff’s Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, now part of the Inflation Reduction Act, as playing a key role in promoting additional investments in the US. The IRA offers numerous tax credits for clean energy manufacturing.
Qcells intends to break ground on the new, state-of-the-art facility in Bartow County, Georgia, where it will manufacture 3.3 GW of solar ingots, wafers, cells and finished modules. The company also has a facility in Dalton, Georgia, where it will assemble an additional 2 GW of modules. With plans to boost the Dalton production by another 5.1 GW, Qcells anticipates that its total production in Georgia will be 8.4 GW in 2024.
“Today’s Hanwha Qcells announcement to make the largest solar investment in US history is a big deal for Georgia’s working families and the American economy. And, this investment is a direct result of my economic plan and the Inflation Reduction Act,” said President Joe Biden.
Microsoft ranks as the fifth largest corporate procurer of solar, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, though this high-profile transaction will likely move it up the list. There are now 23 US companies that have installed at least 100 MW of solar capacity, up from 11 companies in 2019. Eighteen of the top 25 companies ranked in this report are pursuing 100% renewable energy or carbon neutral goals.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/26/key-takeaways-from-solar-quality-summit-europe/,"EVENTS,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,QUALITY,EUROPE",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JANUARY 26, 2023",Key takeaways from Solar Quality Summit Europe,"Stakeholders across the solar industry converged in Barcelona, Spain, at this year’s Solar Quality Summit Europe to discuss best practices in operations and maintenance (O&M), asset management, and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC). The two-day conference this week attracted around 250 participants, according to the co-organizers, SolarPower Europe and Intersolar Europe.
SolarPower Europe CEO Walburga Hemetsberger opened the session by cautioning that failing to deliver on quality threatens the loss of trust of politicians, investors, and the public. And while the panelists argued that the marginal cost of quality is minimal, they noted just how important it is to prepare early on to establish supply chains, train workers, or lock in deals with the best suppliers.
Sessions on finance and bankability, technology, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards focused on developing best practices, in order to avoid the mistakes of the solar boom of the late 2000s. Spain, in particular, experienced a flood of solar installations in 2008, prior to the end of its generous incentive program.
“Today many if not all of the utility plants installed around that time should be revamped,” Asier Ukar, managing director of PI Berlin’s Spanish subsidiary, told pv magazine.
A panel on revamping and repowering said that replacing low-efficiency PV modules with today’s 21%-efficient panels could lead to energy yield gains of around 8%, even without altering the fixed power of PV systems. Revamped sites would also require up to 20% less space to produce the same amount of power, according to the panelists. They said this would open up the opportunity to use that extra land for boosting local biodiversity, for example.
Emergency legislative changes at the European level could also simplify and speed up the approval process to revamp projects, providing a second chance for quality installations and better-performing assets. And as it might make financial sense to revamp or repower sites with modules performing at as high as 90% capacity, recycling schemes and the second-life market in Europe could also get a boost in the coming years.
Another topic was the role of factory and transportation audits in quality manufacturing. While the industry is increasingly adopting n-type module technology, 20% to 25% of these modules are found to need reworking during factory audits, according to Arthur Claire, head of technology at technical compliance and quality consultancy Sinovoltaics. The lack of standards for transportation audits and the resulting lack of accountability for damaged products shows a pressing need for companies and the industry as a whole to put systems in place to assure quality at each step of the way.
Other topics included innovations in monitoring, including a new peer-to-peer model to rival digital twin solutions in residential monitoring from Dutch software company Solar Monkey, and aerial solutions for image-based fault detection from UK-based Above.

In those days, the terms net zero, carbon neutral, and renewable were far from commonplace.
Image: Evident
As efforts intensify to meet climate change and emission reduction targets, consumers and businesses alike have recognized the importance of being able to independently verify sources of electricity using RECs.
In addition to helping individuals and companies make the right choices to keep their carbon footprint down, and meet corporate sustainability goals, tradable RECs also help unlock climate finance for clean power generators who can expand their sustainable energy production portfolios as a result.
Amid predictions the uptake of RECs will feature an annual growth rate of 26% from 2021 to 2030, there is growing demand for energy reporting to match consumption with renewable electricity supplies on an hourly, or smaller, timescale.
Such “granular” RECs are growing in popularity among corporate buyers addressing arguments that some organizations have been greenwashing by allocating renewable energy consumption from sources such as solar when energy generation is not occurring, for example at night. Whilst many argue that it is perfectly reasonable to allocate energy from a different time-period, some consumers are taking a cautious approach to avoid any potentially negative headlines. Evident is innovating in this arena, supporting certification with sub-hourly data and allowing for granular allocation to specific time periods and consumption units, down to the watt-hour. Having such certificates available will help consumers, generators, markets, and regulators make better-informed decisions.
Last year, Evident worked with Google to develop a granular REC project in Chile. Through the certificates provided, Google was able to match its Chilean data center‘s hourly energy consumption with hourly generation from three renewable energy projects. This project has continued and Evident is now developing certification of energy storage options. Businesses around the world are increasingly looking for granular RECs.
The emerging hydrogen economy is also pushing innovation in certification as consumers and governments demand a closer relationship between the renewable electricity generation consumed for hydrogen production than an annual REC certificate provides. For example, some believe that hydrogen that uses solar power certificates cannot be truly powered by solar energy at night without storage.
Certification of clean assets is expected to see significant growth during the next decade. There is growing demand for the certification of hydrogen as an energy carrier and for the certification of metals and other raw materials serving global manufacturing. Ultimately, consumer goods will have full impact information associated with them, which will require significant development and innovation throughout certification markets. For this to occur, there has to be certification of primary inputs, such as gas and electricity. We are already witnessing a wider use of certification throughout supply chains as major corporations place environmental obligations on their suppliers.
Large multinational organizations can have departments dedicated to managing their portfolio of sustainability action while smaller organizations require accessible and robust solutions that can deliver proportionately similar impact. All of these supply chain actions and impacts need to provide the full picture of Scope 3 reporting, which concerns emissions from supply chain companies not owned by the reporting organization. Evident believes that the only robust method that can achieve this impact is market-based action evidenced by independent certification.
At Evident, we are building a global ecosystem of solutions with partners around the world who are implementing a range of connected services. These services will enable consumers of all types to demonstrate their commitment to sustainable business operations and consumption, as well providing a valuable revenue stream to projects.
Certification is enabling the development of the clean economy and is a key component in the energy transition – so questions are often asked as to whether it should become mandatory.
At Evident, we believe this could be taken a step further through Full Disclosure Certification – reporting all energy sources, from fossil fuels to renewables. Full Disclosure Certification acts like a nutritional label, providing consumers with a detailed make-up of their energy. European countries, including the Netherlands, Austria, and Switzerland are already implementing Full Disclosure Certification, and it is Evident’s goal to make this globally commonplace.
Energy certification should be the norm, not the exception.

“The ultra-thin and lightweight glass can be applied subsequently to facades or directly incorporated into solar modules as a composite material – and even onto curved surfaces,” said Fraunhofer FEP researcher Valentin Heise. “Dirt-repellent, easy to clean surfaces ensure transparency and cleanliness for facades and more efficient and consistent energy production for solar, with less maintenance costs.”
The researchers explained that titanium dioxide is a material that is hydrophobic when is not exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and superhydrophilic when radiated.
“In the case of photoinduced hydrophilicity, the surface changes from hydrophobic to superhydrophilic after approximately 30 minutes of irradiation with sun-like UV light,” they stated.
They said that the dirt on the solar panels can be removed by the coating at night, when the hydrophobicity of the surface washes it away through the beading raindrops. The cyclical alternation of hydrophobic and superhydrophilic effects prevents the dirt to adhere to the panel surface during the day.
The scientists fabricated the first coating prototype with long roll of thin glass with a thickness of 100 micrometers. They used a titanium oxide film with a thickness of 30 nanometers to 150 nanometers and a pilot plant for roll-to-roll coating provided by German equipment supplier Von Ardenne.
The research team said it is currently working on improving by adjusting the properties of titanium dioxide and thin glass in a cost-efficient way.
“In the future, work will also be done by Fraunhofer FEP on layer systems that can be activated not only with UV light but also with visible light,” they said. “The production and embedding of nanoparticles or doping with nitrogen, for example, are also being considered.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/26/scientists-assess-time-for-perovskite-pv-to-become-competitive-on-rooftops/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 26, 2023",Scientists assess lifetime for perovskite PV to become competitive on rooftops,"An international research group has assessed what levels of efficiency and stability perovskite solar cells have to achieve to become an economically viable technology to compete with crystalline silicon cells in the rooftop segment.
“The weight of photovoltaic modules drives up costs for installation, transportation, and labor,” Michael Saliba, the research lead author and director at the Institute for Photovoltaics at the University of Stuttgart, told pv magazine. “Utilizing lightweight, high-performance perovskite modules can lower these costs and open a new market in which perovskites are a competitive option.”
The scientists assessed the necessary lifetime (LT) of a perovskite module, which they defined as the time until a module has 80% of its initial efficiency, as a function of efficiencies to be competitive in the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE).
They found that perovskite solar modules might need to provide 20% efficiency for at least 36 years, or 25% efficiency for a minimum of 21 years, if they want to compete with conventional PV panels.
“This demonstrates that even with the significantly lower production costs of perovskites, it is challenging to become competitive with silicon, mainly because of the low LT of current perovskite solar cells and the limited experience with perovskite module stability,” said the scientists.
However, perovskite tech may have some interesting cards to play if the scientific community and the industry will become able to reduce its installation and structural balance-of-system (BOS) costs, as these usually account for around 10% of a PV system costs.
“With lightweight or flexible modules, the installation becomes significantly less arduous,” they said, noting that transport costs would be significantly lowered. “Materials costs could be reduced if simpler installation such as glueing could replace racking.”
The academics assumed a levelized cost of electricity for the United States of $0.119/kWh to $0.136/kW for residential PV systems based on conventional panels in 2021. Their estimates ranged from $0.055/kWh to $0.063/kW for the same installations in 2030.
Their analysis showed that by using flexible substrates, perovskite solar modules would need to achieve lower target efficiencies of 15% and LTs spanning from 13 to 22 years to compete with crystalline silicon in the 2021 scenario, and efficiencies of 17% and LTs spanning from 16 to 34 years in the 2030 scenario.
“This offers a wider corridor of possible combinations in which perovskites could reach the same electricity cost as silicon,” they concluded.
The scientists presented their findings in “Toward commercialization with lightweight, flexible perovskite solar cells for residential photovoltaics,” which was recently published in Joule. The group features academics from the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands, the University of the Basque Country in Spain, and the University of New South Wales in Australia.
The latest edition of pv magazine considers how industry heavyweights are increasingly planning gigawatt-scale assets, looks at the huge potential repowering could unlock for German solar, and examines how solar can help trucking companies in the energy transition. A packed edition also features a focus on the Middle East.

The country plans to produce hydrogen at $2.40/kg by 2035, and aims to halve this figure by 2050, according to the Turkish energy minister, Fatih Donmez.
“When we talk about Turkey, everything is possible. I am sure it will achieve this hydrogen target. The most important thing is cheap electricity, which will mostly come from solar,” Gulmira Rzayeva, senior visiting research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, told pv magazine.
Renewable energy price trends, water availability, local demand, and the flexibility of national support schemes are supporting the hydrogen price forecasts. Rzayeva said Turkey will import electrolysis technology over the medium term.
“So far, Turkey has not this kind of technology,” she explained. “As of now, if the country decides to go for green hydrogen, it needs to import electrolyzers.”
She added that the country will invest in innovation to produce electrolysis technology domestically within the next decade.
“Turkey will try, in the next years, to replicate the success story we have seen in PV technology,” she said. “A decade ago, it was importing 100% of PV technology – now it produces locally up to 90% of its PV technology.”
The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies Research Fellow said that the country aims to blend up to 2% to 5% hydrogen into gas grids before 2030, 10% by 2040, and 20% by 2050.
Rzayeva said that Turkey will increase its PV energy production with or without hydrogen.
“Factoring in hydrogen production, the rise will be even stronger than the expected targets.” For now, Turkey expects solar installed power to reach 52,900 MW by 2035.
Renewable energy sources, which had a 16.7% share in primary energy consumption in 2020, are expected to increase to 23.7% in 2035.
“The Turkish government is pushing very aggressively to support PV, mostly through feed-in-tariffs and auctions. For each auction, the cost of both wind and solar is decreasing. The government is supporting renewables by providing purchasing guarantees for 10 years,” said Rzayeva. “The company can sell it to the government or on exchange platforms also at higher prices. There is a huge interest.”.
For now, the primary hurdle for Turkey's hydrogen ambitions comes from policy uncertainty – mainly in the European Union, said Rzayeva.
“From a business point of view, it is very uncertain what the market will be in a few years. There is no market regulation or design,” she said. “There are many risks to investing in hydrogen production and export facilities. It will take some time for Turkey to have a clear picture.”

The US Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 contains $370 billion in spending for renewable energy and climate measures. The bill includes more than $60 billion for domestic manufacturing across the clean energy supply chain. This historic level of investment is key to achieving American manufacturing independence and clean energy security.
A recent report from Wood Mackenzie indicates that developers, engineering procurement construction (EPCs) companies, and manufacturers will be on the lookout for guidance from the US Treasury Department and the IRS for clarity in order to strategize new solar development and investment in new manufacturing facilities within the United States.
The report looks at trends in this burgeoning industry, including a focus on TOPCon modules over heterojunction (HJT), growth in the global residential inverter market, an expansion of tracker manufacturing, an expected drop in solar project costs and a look at challenges going forward.
TOPcon vs. PERC
TOPCon, which stands for tunnel oxide passivated contacts, is expected to outrace heterojunction (HJT), and the Wood Mackenzie report notes that mono PERC “is the technology that balances maturity and efficiency”, indicating that TOPCon has the highest growth potential due to process improvements and cost optimization.
“The PERC panel technology has also a very fast learning curve and the balance between them will depend on which one will be able to increase its efficiency or reduce cost faster than the other one,” Stefan Gunz, the head of photovoltaics research at Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE), told pv magazine a year ago.
Wood Mackenzie analysts estimate that TOPCon modules have reached a 25% efficiency in mass production and may climb to 28.7%
Upgrading manufacturing from mono PERC production to TOPCon is a simple and relatively low-cost investment, and the analysts estimate that a lab efficiency of 27% could be achieved through improvements in metallization and thinner wafers. Wood Mackenzie notes that some manufacturers expect the average wafer thickness for large-format TOPCon modules to decrease 20 μm this year to 120 μm, which will drive most of the price reductions in 2023.
The Inflation Reduction Act is stimulating US module manufacturing as a result of the $30 billion in production tax credits as well as the $10 billion investment tax credit to build clean technology manufacturing facilities. Wood Mackenzie expects US module production capacity to surpass 15 GW by the end of this year.
The big question, however, is the definition of “domestically made equipment”, and whether it means that the modules are assembled in the United States, or if all components are made in the US. The challenge for module makers is that there is virtually no wafer or cell manufacturing in the US, although that is changing with recent announcements by companies including Qcells and CubicPV. The difference in the interpretation of domestic content “could dramatically affect module manufacturing capacity in the next five years”, the report contends. The analysts estimate that almost 45 GWdc of new capacity announcements will come online by 2026.
Inverters, trackers
The expected growth of solar in the US will ripple through the supply chain, boosting growth in inverters and trackers, among other supporting components. The Wood Mackenzie report notes that recent policy changes, including the EU’s REPowerEU, India’s implementation of Production Linked Incentives (PLI) and the US IRA, will accelerate solar adoption in these countries, thus helping the countries reach their net zero goals.
According to the report, the residential inverter market will grow throughout the world in 2023. With rooftop solar gaining momentum, especially in countries like India and Germany, there will be a corresponding boost in the market for microinverters, string inverters and DC optimizers, the most popular inverter choices for rooftop installations. Notably, string inverters with multiple maximum power point trackers (MPPTs) will see increased market prevalence in 2023.
Residential inverters will see increased use of artificial intelligence in its algorithms. Module-level power electronics (MLPEs) and single-phase string inverters, the most popular in rooftop solar installations, will see an 11% market share in global inverter shipments in 2023. Inverter manufacturing will increase with major players adding production lines and new entrants joining the market, and the ensuing competition will trigger a price drop from 2% to 4% in 2023.
A continuing challenge for inverter manufacturers is the global chip shortage, which the Wood Mackenzie analysts expect to continue through 2023 and spill over into 2024. The shortage has caused inverter manufacturers to source the chips from lower-tier manufacturers before conducting rigorous in-house testing to ensure their inverters’ quality, efficiency and lifespan. Wood Mac predicts that inverter price won’t come down until later this year.
Domestic tracker production is accelerating in several parts of the world due to government incentives as well as the logistical issues experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Wood Mackenzie analysts, tracker prices will drop in India and in the United States. They expect more stability in the steel supply in the US and India, especially with expansion of existing steel manufacturing. Europe, however, will still face an imbalance in the steel market. As over 60% of tracker composition is steel, this rebound in steel demand will result in increased competition in tracker market share for vendors, says Wood Mackenzie analysts, projecting that 2023 pricing for trackers will fall by 5% in the United States, Brazil and China.
Solar costs
Capital expenditure costs will continue to drop, driven in part by increased use of TOPcon modules. Wood Mackenzie analysts also expect polysilicon prices to decline this year and they estimate that the existing 300 GW of global capacity will reach 900 GW by the end of 2023.
“We forecast that over 1 million Mt of polysilicon expansion will come online by 2023. Most of the new capacity will be in China. However, we believe the approximately 10% slated to be outside China may command a price premium as it may be free of tariffs and other policy risks.”
An ongoing challenge is the uncertainty around antidumping/countervailing (AD/CVD) tariff costs. With the US Department of Commerce expected to announce its final determination in May 2023, Wood Mackenzie estimates that duties can range from 16% to 254% based on the country of origin. The preliminary determination, released in December 2022, found tier 1 companies, like Trina, BYD, Vina (a unit of Longi) and Canadian Solar, circumventing Chinese tariffs. The preliminary determination cleared Hanwha and Jinko which will result in some relief in module availability in 2023.
In the United States, developers will continue to focus on requirements of the IRA, including the prevailing wage and domestic content bonus additions for utility-scale projects starting construction in 2023. For projects to claim the full 30% investment tax credit or the production tax credit, all projects larger than 1 MWac must pay its workers a prevailing wage and institute an apprenticeship program.
In Europe, the REPowerEU policy aims to install 320 GW of solar PV by 2025 and 600 GW under its EU solar energy strategy. To meet these ambitious targets, it needs to build a robust manufacturing hub within the region. The new European Solar Photovoltaic Industry Alliance, will create a framework to help secure financing for manufacturing and promote research and innovation in module technology, among other zero-carbon technologies.
A final challenge to PV manufacturing in Europe, according to Wood Mackenzie analysts, is the cost competition from the APAC region due to its higher cost of energy, labor and material, but it could benefit from customers willing to pay a premium for better technology and transparency in the supply chain.

Scientists from Deakin University’s Institute for Frontier Materials (IFM) have developed what they say is a sustainable method to extract silicon from solar panel waste and reconfigure it into nano-silicon which is then used to make high-energy anodes for lithium-ion batteries.
Silicon makes up a relatively small proportion of a solar panel cell and until now it has been difficult to extract that silicon and reduce it down to its nano particles without using hazardous chemicals like hydrochloric acid and nitric acid.
Material scientist Mokhlesur Rahman and Ying Chen, the director of the ARC Research Hub for Safe and Reliable Energy, said they have developed a thermal and chemical process to extract the silicon from solar waste that is cheap, effective and safe for the environment.
The process then takes the purified silicon and reduces its size to nanoscale using a ball-milling process. Again, without the need for toxic chemicals. The nano-silicon is then mixed with graphite to create a battery anode that the researchers said has been shown to increase lithium-ion battery capacity by a factor of 10.
“We are using that nano-silicon to develop low-cost battery materials that will help deliver the higher-performing, longer-lasting, affordable battery technology critically needed to drive Australia’s clean energy transition,” said Rahman.
The scientists said the process, which they have been investigating since 2019 and have repeatedly tested and reviewed to prove it can work and be scaled up for commercial use, is key to repurposing discarded solar cells and will prevent high-value waste from going to landfill.
“Solar panel cells are fabricated using high-value silicon but this material cannot be re-used without purification as it becomes highly contaminated over the 25 to 30 years of the panel’s life,” Rahman said.
“We have developed a process that returns silicon collected from used cells to greater than 99% purity, within a day and without the need for dangerous chemicals.”
Rahman said the process is far greener, cheaper, and more efficient than any other technique currently on the market and represents a breakthrough that could make recycling solar panels far more economically viable.
Chen said the process – including purification, nano-silicon production and integration into new battery technology – “is a giant leap forward in how we tackle the problem of solar panel waste.”
“Silicon recovered from end-of-life solar panels can be a massive, sustainable source of nano-silicon to meet future demand for raw battery materials. Helping to power the homes, transport and communities of the future,” he said.
It is expected that more than 100,000 tons of end-of-life solar panels will enter Australia’s waste stream by 2035.
