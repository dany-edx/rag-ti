However, most OSCs are produced by the spin-coating technique, which allows for relatively high power conversion efficiencies, but with poor scalability.
A further obstacle to the commercialization of OSCs is that the most commonly used flexible electrode, indium tin oxide (ITO), makes them expensive and too fragile for large-area modules. But researchers at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) in South Korea have developed a new way to create OSCs with zinc oxide (ZnO), overcoming the issues of cost and scalability. The team used sputtered ZnO and a ZnO nanoparticle layer obtained through a blade-coating technique, in order to create a uniform bilayer on an ultra-thin silver film electrode.
“The ultra-thin silver film electrode with ZnO bilayer has the flexibility, wettability, and high surface energy of ITO, but is not brittle or expensive,” said Hongkyu Kang, a senior researcher at GIST. “This makes it easier to use ZnO for manufacturing organic solar cells and developing a printing technology for large-area solar cell technology.”
The new ZnO bilayer-based OSCs has an efficiency of 7.67% and a module area of 528 square centimeters. According to the researchers, this makes it the most efficient large-area OSC ever reported. They said the key to such power conversion efficiency was to reduce the “recombination” of charge carriers in OSCs by the crystalline ZnO nanoparticles. That also improved the open-circuit voltage.
They described their findings in “Overcoming the Low-Surface-Energy-Induced Wettability Problem of Flexible and Transparent Electrodes for Large-Area Organic Photovoltaic Modules over 500 cm2” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials. The research was the result of an industry-university collaboration, in which GIST developed the technology and transferred it to South Korean manufacturer MSWAY Co., Ltd.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/18/evolar-claims-25-year-stability-for-perovskite-cells/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE,SWEDEN",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 18, 2022",Evolar claims 25-year stability for perovskite cells,"Perovskite solar cells have no doubt caught the solar industry’s eye with their potential for high efficiency and low-cost, low-impact manufacturing. However, questions over long-term stability and how the materials would fare left in demanding outdoor conditions for many years continue to hang over the technology, and it will take some convincing demonstrations in both laboratory and outdoor testing to persuade investors.
Swedish startup Evolar, led by founders of now-insolvent CIGS thin-film manufacturer Solibro, is developing a turnkey production line for perovskite cells. The company said it can be added to silicon production lines as an upgrade to tandem cell production. It claimed that its “PV Power Booster” perovskite technology could increase cell energy yield by 25% at a very low cost, and noted that it will be soon be able to offer manufacturing solutions that could have customers producing perovskite cells within 18 months of signing contracts.
Now, the company is looking to make just such a convincing demonstration: This week, it announced that it has put its technology – in the form of encapsulated, semi transparent standalone perovskite modules with an active area of 100 square centimeters – through a series of industry-standard accelerated reliability tests. And the results suggest that the cells could stand up to 25 years if deployed outdoors.
Evolar CEO Mats Ljunggren told pv magazine that the cells were exposed to damp heat conditions – 85% humidity at a temperature of 85 C, for double the 1,000 hours specified in IEC testing standards (IEC 61215). While the company has not made the full test results available, Ljunggren said that they were within the margin of 5% performance loss specified in the standard.
The cells for testing were produced on Evolar’s prototype production line in Uppsala, Sweden, where it is working to scale up evaporation-based processes for perovskite layer deposition.
“The device has a P-I-N structure. All layers are deposited with industrial compatible dry processes,” said Ljunggren. “In the perovskite layer we have avoided MA (methylammonium) from our start of development for stability reasons. The module is made by monolithic interconnection by laser scribing and is encapsulated in a glass-glass laminate.”
He added that the encapsulation strategy is also key for stability, and that here Evolar is able to build on its experience with other thin-film PV technologies at Solibro to select the best materials and strategies for both encapsulation and edge sealing.
The testing was conducted internally at Evolar’s laboratories, and has not been verified by any third party. And while encouraging, it is widely acknowledged that proving long-term reliability in the field is about much more than just being able to pass certification tests. Results from accelerated testing over much longer periods, verified by results from actual outdoor testing, will be the next step for manufacturers looking to show that perovskites can meet the solar industry’s demanding performance expectations.

(SPNEC), the listed unit of Manila-based PV module manufacturer and project developer Solar Philippines, has announced that it is working on what could be the world’s largest solar project.
SPNEC has unveiled plans to add a 3.5 GW solar farm to its 500 MW flagship project on the island of Luzon, “for which the first 50 MW and the transmission for the full 500 MW are under construction.” Now, the company is looking to acquire another 2,500 hectares in the provinces of Nueva Ecija and Bulacan to extended its original project eightfold.
“At 4 GW, SPNEC’s combined developments in this area would surpass the capacity of India’s Bhadla Solar Farm, currently the world’s largest farm at over 2.2 GW; as well as surpass the capacity of the total grid-connected solar operating in the Philippines as of the end of 2021 at over 1.3 GW,” stated SPNEC.
SPNEC is using the proceeds from various capital raises to acquire the land for the 3.5 GW project extension, including a previously announced stock rights offering to raise at least PHP 10 billion ($179 million), as well as planned asset-for-share swap with parent company Solar Philippines, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2022.
SPNEC said it has been able to plan such a massive project as it has been working to secure land and permits since 2016 when it applied with the Department of Energy for its first solar energy service contract in the area. In addition, the company said this clustering of projects will benefit from the transmission infrastructure works already underway in the area, which will extend over 60 kilometers to connect to NGCP’s (National Grid Corp. of the Philippines) substations that supply the Greater Manila Area.
“Over the years, others did not believe these ranchlands far from the grid could be the site for a solar farm,” said Solar Philippines founder Leandro Leviste. “By the end of this year, our planned share issuances should result in the consolidation of ingredients that would enable SPNEC to expand its flagship project to be the world’s largest solar farm.”

The heterojunction module maker cited the US climate change and health care package as one of the reasons it is accelerating its manufacturing plans, along with a big module order from New York-based developer DE Shaw Renewable Investments. Publishing its first-half results on its website this week, Meyer Burger said the extension of the Investment Tax Credit for solar manufacturing in the United States – which was part of the Inflation Reduction Act – will be worth $0.07 times the nominal power output of each Meyer Burger module produced stateside.
DE Shaw has placed an order for 3.75 GW of the European manufacturer's panels, to be delivered from 2024 to 2029. It will pay a “substantial annual down payment” to help Meyer Burger fund the production capacity required to meet such delivery requirements.
However, the European company said the US tax incentive and customer deposits will not be sufficient to finance a doubling of its manufacturing capacity to 3 GW per year. The business, headquartered in Gwatt, Switzerland, said it would need a further CHF 250 million ($262.3 million) to add 1.5 GW of production lines at its base in Thalheim, Germany, and 1 GW at its location in Goodyear, Arizona. Details of the fundraising effort will be announced to shareholders “in the next months,” the company said.
Traditionally a solar production equipment supplier, Meyer Burger's decision to venture into module production has come at a cost to its bottom line as it ramps up its panel-making facilities. First-half revenue leapt from CHF 18 million in the first six months of last year to CHF 56.7 million this time around, with Meyer Burger stating that it was successfully passing on rising input costs to customers.
That led to a widening in net six-month losses, from the CHF 37.2 million shed in January-June 2021 to CHF 41 million. The investment required for module production has seen the company's cash balance fall from CHF 247 million at the end of last year to CHF 186 million at the end of June. The good news is that DE Shaw has an option to expand its order to up to 5 GW of high-efficiency modules and to extend the length of the supply deal.

UbiQD, a nanotechnology company, has revealed that its quantum dot solar technology will be used in a Small Business Innovation Research project with the US Air Force. The contract provides funding for two installations of more than 20 windows and additional scale-up and development funds for the product.
“We are seeing strong fiscal support for sustainability initiatives in the built environment right now,” said CEO Hunter McDaniel. “Our expanded contract with the US Air Force couldn’t come at a better time, right as we are scaling and ahead of the upgraded solar investment tax incentives.”
The company uses luminescent quantum dot tinting to concentrate solar energy and generate electricity while maintaining transparency. Quantum dots are photoluminescent particles so small that it would take 100,000 of them to span one fingernail, said UbiQD. The company said the technology has applications in localized DC microgrids and smart building solutions, including integration with sensors for climate and ambient controls.
Commercial buildings account for 36% of all US electricity consumption at a cost of more than $190 billion annually. Additionally, windows represent 30% of a commercial building’s heating and cooling energy, costing US building owners about $50 billion annually, according to the US Department of Energy.
UbiQD’s quantum-dot tinted window, called WENDOW, has recently been installed in a series of demonstrations projects, including a campus building at the Western Washington University, which the company said is the largest solar window installation to date. The WENDOW can be tinted, allowing for colorful designs. The university installation features vibrant yellow and orange windows. 
“This technology helps Western Washington University get closer to achieving our sustainability goals on campus,” said David Patrick, vice provost for research. “I was impressed by how easily the windows were installed and love how great they look. I’m hoping to see more projects like this on campus in the near future.” 
While the solar windows offer less efficiency than a conventional solar panel, they represent an alternative to blending photovoltaics with the build environment. Read more about solar in uncommon spaces.
UbiQD also builds translucent panels for greenhouses that are integrated with photoluminescent particles that are efficient at converting light into a preferable wavelength. The UbiQD “UbiGro” panels glow a spectrum of color that is optimized for plant growth, absorbing UV and blue light and emitting fruitful orange or red light.
In recent trials, UbiGro led to a 21% boost in flowering in geranium flowers, a 14 to 28% boost in winter strawberry growth, and an 8% yield increase in cannabis production. Increased crop yields are a welcome sign to any grower, and the two companies are set to take that benefit one step further, integrating productive solar PV in the greenhouse-topping modules.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/18/case-study-when-trackers-are-blown-away-you-cant-blame-the-wind/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,INSTALLATIONS,QUALITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,SPAIN",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"AUGUST 18, 2022","Case study: When trackers are blown away, you can’t blame the wind","From pv magazine Spain
We begin with a “real world” case study: At a 70 MW solar plant in Spain, 20 to 30 modules are being blown off of the trackers every few weeks. The plant is located in “wind zone C” – one of the windiest in Spain’s classification system, as we’ll find out shortly.
The tracker manufacturer claims that the incident is due to “extraordinary phenomena,” despite the fact that the anemometer registers values below the regulations, which is 29 meters per second for that area. This is the maximum pressure that the module anchors are capable of withstanding due to the wind.
The maximum pressure depends on several factors: the dimensions of the module, the length of the rows or rail panels, and whether staples or screws are used. The maximum pressure that the manufacturer accepts varies based on the design of the system, but is usually 2,400, 2,100, 1,800 pascals, or less.
The engineering, procurement and construction provider that purchased the trackers has blamed the anchoring system. The module manufacturer approved the design, but the tracker is not specifically named in the installation manual. The EPC contractor said that only a few modules have been blown away, but the reality is that the entire plant is theoretically exposed to potential wind damage.
“The problem is not only that some panels are blown away, but that those that have not been blown away (yet) are suffering mechanical fatigue in the anchor joints, weakening them and increasing the probability that they will start to be blown away en masse in the future,” said Asier Ukar, senior consultant and managing director of PI Berlin S.L.
Ukar has analyzed the case and has agreed to share his findings with pv magazine. He said the worst thing is that this happened after the EPC warranty. In this project, a few months remain until the end of the guarantee period, and after unsuccessful attempts to reach an agreement, an arbitration period begins.
This is a case that will sound familiar to more than a few readers. As prevention is usually better than finding a cure, Ukar identifies the design factors to take into account in similar cases.
“You need to ask the manufacturer to guarantee the specific anchoring method used for a particular module and for the particular project loads,” said Ukar.
For example, you can anchor a module measuring 2,384 mm x 1,096 mm (210 mm wafers) with four screws to a 400 mm strap, assuming a maximum pressure of 2,400 Pa. But that's not the same as anchoring a module measuring 2,256 mm x 1,133 mm (182 mm wafers) stapled to a 1,400 mm strap, assuming the same pressure.
It is common to find that the “pressure-anchorage-strap” triangle is not correctly reflected in the module installation manual. Without a clear certification, the responsibilities begin to be diluted.
“It is almost never clearly reflected because it doesn't matter. If the calculation is very transparent, the owner can see that the design is weak and demand reinforcement, which implies an increase in price and then the tracker manufacturer loses competitiveness”, said Ukar.
The Iberian Peninsula is divided, according to the Eurocode, into three wind zones: A, B and C. Zone C covers the windiest areas, such as Tarifa or Jerez. In this area, the Technical Building Code (CTE) dictates that a tracker must resist winds of 29 meters per second (104 km per hour), registered at 10 meters from the ground for 10 minutes. Since both the tracker and the anemometer are always located at lower levels, it is necessary to correct said speed, generally at the level of the latter, to make an “apples to apples” comparison.
Hellmann's exponential law is used to make this correction. Depending on the type of terrain, one coefficient or another is used, distinguishing between “flat places with ice or grass,” “rural areas,” or “very rough terrain or cities.” The coefficient “α” will therefore vary between 0.08 and 0.25, thus the design speed of the tracker being higher or lower depending on the type of terrain chosen. If a tracker manufacturer assumes rougher terrain than it really is, it will work with a lower design speed and therefore any speed higher than this value could be classified as “extraordinary.” The correct classification of the terrain must be done by the tracker manufacturer, and it is a key issue.
This observation also extends to the calculation of the dynamic pressure through the use of an appropriate exposure coefficient. In other words, the pressure that the structure must withstand will depend on the force exerted by the wind on the surface of the modules. And this force, again, depends on the type of terrain, and specifically on its degree of roughness, which is also clearly tabulated by regulations and divided into five classes from land ranging from “by the sea” to land “in business centers of large cities.” Analogously to the previous case, choosing a degree of roughness greater than the real one favors the calculations of the tracker manufacturer.
Another important issue involves the plastic limit of the anchors – that is, the maximum pressure they can resist before deforming. For this, finite element calculations are used, which constitute a fundamental part of all static calculations. In these calculations, it must be verified that the limit of materials is not exceeded by the forces resulting from the static calculation. This does not happen automatically. It is not uncommon to observe finite element calculations that show joint areas between the strap and the screw or staple in dark orange or red, clearly pointing to a risk of fatigue and subsequent breakage in operating conditions.
Finally, before moving on to the dynamic stress, it is essential to understand that some tracker manufacturers perform the structural calculation in the operating position (not stowed) with temporary values of the speed of only 3 seconds when really, the time necessary for the tracker to move into its stow position is much longer, often around 30 seconds. This entails a clear structural risk.
Dynamic calculations are “another world,” according to Ukar. Dynamic calculation does not have as many guidelines or pre-established rules, as is the case with static calculation.
“Here we are talking about dynamic phenomena such as the famous torsional gallop or flutter, which are more difficult to predict and depends on numerous factors,” he said.
In order to adequately model the dynamic behavior of a tracker, additional testing instruments and parameters are required. One of these resources are scale models tested in a wind tunnel, which serve to obtain information on the dynamic behavior of the structure. It is an open secret that no tracker manufacturer carries out a wind tunnel test for every project due to time and cost.
Consequently, the results of previous studies are usually “reused” for future projects, leading to a consequent lack of “customization.” This can be seen when the tracker manufacturer provides, as part of the dynamic calculation dossier, studies up to three years old, often done on previous models and with piling geometry, overhangs and module dimensions that differ from those that apply to the project in question.
With regard to torsional stiffness, the premises assumed by the manufacturer to reduce thickness in the “torque tube” must be analyzed. If everything is so clear, why do cases of wind damage continue to crop up?
Although tracker manufacturers have more than enough knowledge to design robust trackers, price pressures force them to take risks in order to be competitive. This sometimes leads to reckless designs based.
“The sector must be willing to absorb an increase in the cost of trackers of … [up to] €0.03 (per watt), depending on the geographical location and the type of module used, if it is really intended to have systems with structural guarantees at 30 years,” said Ukar.

Sydney-listed Magnis Energy Technologies has launched production at its massive Imperium3 (iM3NY) lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant in New York, with an annual production target of 1 GWh of battery cell capacity by the end of 2023.
Magnis Energy Technologies said the New York plant will work at an initial production rate of several thousand cells in the first month. Output will then be scaled up to 1 GWh per annum by 2023, before being ramped up to 1.8 GWh, which is the equivalent to about 15,000 battery cells per day. The company aims to increase annual production to 38 GWh of battery cell capacity by the end of 2030.
“Despite a challenging global environment and supply chain issues, we have successfully started production close to schedule which is a major achievement,” said Chaitanya Sharma, chief executive officer for iM3NY. “We now look forward to increasing production rates toward and over the gigawatt-hour mark.”
The plant will manufacture cells featuring C4V’s patented Charge CCCV technology, which relies on bio-mineralized lithium manganese phosphate (BMLMP) cathode technology. The chemistry, which is free of nickel and cobalt, incorporates traditional electrolyte along with a patented mixed metal phosphate composition in the cathode which the company said enables 3.9 volts of charge – one of the highest voltages of any lithium-ion cells in the marketplace.
Magnis said the voltage is 20% higher than lithium-ion phosphate cells and up to 8% higher than nickel cobalt aluminium and nickel manganese cobalt cells.
“All aspects of the cell have been considered and engineered to ensure maximum performance, safety and the ability to manufacture high volumes,” said the company.
