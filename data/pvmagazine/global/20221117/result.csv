Stanwell, an energy generator owned by the Australian state government of Queensland, described the agreement its biggest retail deal yet. The utility will supply UK-headquartered Anglo American with enough renewable energy to power the mining giant’s five steelmaking coal operations across central Queensland’s Bowen Basin from 2025.
The renewable energy will be sourced from Spanish developer X-Elio’s 200 MW Blue Grass Solar Farm in Queensland’s Western Downs region and the 450 MW first stage of the Clarke Creek wind project being built by Windlab northwest of Rockhampton.
Anglo American, one of the world's largest mining giants and Australia’s second largest metallurgical coal miner, said the deal will power all electrical equipment at its mines in Moranbah, Middlemount and Moura, including draglines, longwall equipment, conveyors, coal preparation facilities, lighting and ventilation and cooling infrastructure, water treatment plant and administration facilities.
Dan van der Westhuizen, the chief executive of Anglo American in Australia, said the power purchase agreement would effectively remove all Scope 2 emissions from the miner’s steelmaking coal business in Australia from 2025 and would accelerate its aim of carbon-neutral operations by 2040.
“Securing 100% renewables from Stanwell is a major step toward our target of carbon-neutral operations in Australia, and globally, by 2040,” he said.
He added that many of the metals and minerals Anglo American produces, including steelmaking coal, are critical to the energy transition. Evidently, the miner considers itself a necessary evil in this regard.
“We are committed to playing our part against climate change, including through renewable energy use and accelerating a number of technologies to abate our on-site emissions,” Westhuizen said. “Today’s deal brings significant environmental benefits and is NPV positive compared with our current energy mix, while underwriting a large investment in renewable energy generation for Queensland.”
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the partnership between Anglo American and Stanwell, historically known only for coal-fired energy generation, demonstrated the strong shift to clean energy from Queensland businesses.
The announcement comes just days after Stanwell, through its retail arm Stanwell Energy, inked a deal to supply up to 185 GWh of renewable energy a year to help power the Brisbane Airport Corp.‘s operations.

Australia-based ReNu Energy and its wholly owned subsidiary Countrywide Hydrogen have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Anantara Energy, a partnership between Singapore-based independent power producer Quantum Power Asia and German PV developer ib vogt, to investigate the feasibility of developing a large-scale green hydrogen production facility in Indonesia. The plan features a 10 MW electrolyzer supported by at least 100 MW of solar.
Under the terms of the non-binding agreement Countrywide and Anantara will jointly study the feasibility of establishing a solar-powered green hydrogen production facility in Indonesia’s Riau archipelago, south of Singapore.
Anantara Director Simon Bell said he expects green hydrogen and ammonia produced from renewable energy will play a key role in a future net-zero economy for Indonesia and the region more broadly. This is in addition to the demand he believes will emerge from Europe as a key export market for Indonesia.
“We have agreed to collaborate with Countrywide Hydrogen to jointly conduct and fund a concept study and a detailed techno-commercial feasibility study for the set up of a green hydrogen production facility, and the viability of investing in the development of commercial arrangements for clean hydrogen in Indonesia,” he said.
The planned concept and feasibility studies will explore an initial 10 MW electrolyzer capable of producing approximately 1,650 tonnes of green hydrogen per year. If supported by the feasibility study, Anantara will develop, fund, and operate at least 100 MW of solar to provide clean energy to the facility.
ReNu Executive Director and Countrywide Managing Director Geoffrey Drucker said it is expected the solar-powered facility would supply green hydrogen to offtakers in Indonesia. Once local demand is met, supply can then be directed for export to other countries in Asia and potentially Europe.
“Green hydrogen will play a major role in a future net-zero economy for Indonesia and Asia more broadly, creating emission-free power generation, transportation for mining, and industrial processes,” Drucker said. “We plan to meet the needs of a competitive market, and this production facility will continuously expand to reach a broader ASEAN market through an agreed energy export scheme.
Subject to a positive outcome of the studies, it is expected the financial close for the green hydrogen manufacturing facility could occur in 2024 with green hydrogen production to commence in 2025.
Anantara has already committed to invest up to almost $6 billion to develop a 3.5 GW solar and storage facility in Riau. The joint venture has secured more than 600 hectares of land and is in the process of obtaining permitting rights as well as financing commitments for developing a 3.5 GW solar plant with up to 12 GWh of energy storage capacity.
The PV plant is expected to generate an estimated 4 TWh of clean energy annually for the purpose of providing baseload clean energy to the local population and industry. Anantara also intends to export clean energy to Singapore via an undersea cable.
The agreement with Anantara comes after Countrywide last week signed a term sheet with Australian superannuation fund HESTA for an investment of up to $67.1 million in the company’s green hydrogen projects and just hours after the company announced it would work with the operators of Launceston Airport in Tasmania to investigate the development of a multi-purpose solar-powered green hydrogen project at the airport.

“The factory updates the previous manufacturing facility we had in Jeddah and is expected to reach its peak capacity in the following weeks,” a PVH spokesperson told pv magazine.
PVH Chairman Iván Higueras said that the new factory in Saudi Arabia will double the company's capacity in the Middle East. It aims to start exporting its trackers internationally, he added.
The company has been producing more than 60% of its components in the country since 2021. Youssef Elsayed, managing director of PVH Middle East, said the goal is to reach 90% local content.
“This new factory upgrades the previous facility with new state-of-the-art machinery,” added Elsayed.
The company says the mounting structures from its new factory will be used in projects throughout the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Australia. It aims to supply around 7 GW of products in the Middle East alone by 2023.

According to ITRI, 96% of the materials in the module can be recovered, including all of the solar cells and encapsulation glass.
“The cells can be restored to the bare silicon wafer via a reverse dismantling process, and then produced into regenerated cells for use in the manufacturing chain of PV modules,” ITRI’s R&D team told pv magazine.

The two entities claim their technology improves on the traditional module structure, which uses thermoset ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) or polyolefin (PO) as encapsulants. These bond materials tightly together, complicating their separation during the recycling process.
By contrast, their new solution uses a thermoset EVA/PO and thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) bi-layered compound as encapsulation material. The bi-layer serves as a buffer, protecting the cells from cracking during the dismantling process. The solution also takes advantage of the melting point of TPE when the module is heated for disassembly.
“The designed low-temperate thermal process gradually decomposes the bi-layer film,” the R&D team said. “By the time the solar modules become obsolete, the module can be easily dismantled into various parts.”
Unlike the processing of commercial-use modules, ITRI says the improved process recovers glass and silicon wafers as a whole, rather than as pellets. It claims that this allows for silver to be extracted from the intact solar wafers.
The latest edition of pv magazine considers the impact the Inflation Reduction Act will have on US solar and ponders where the resultant manufacturing sites will land. The situation is just the opposite in Germany, we discover, with PV investors piling up but few suitable sites left for solar farms. We also anticipate shortages in raw materials to drive the electric vehicle revolution, and the measures battery makers are taking to secure supply, and we ponder the effect the rise of TOPCon solar will have on the supply of its preferred encapsulant resin.
The R&D team estimates that the technology increases the value of recycling PV modules from around $18 million to $74 million per gigawatt. The manufacturing process is purportedly the same as for standard modules.
ITRI developed the technology, while URE was responsible for the design and production. The module is in compliance with the IEC 61215 and IEC 61730 safety and reliability standards, certified by  TÜV Rheinland.

German aggregator 1Komma5° aims to start selling PV modules that are guaranteed to have been manufactured without forced labor. It plans to make the 420 W modules with polysilicon from Europe or the United States, according to a recent company statement.
“This is also an advantage with a view to securing your own value chain and decoupling from China,” said 1Komma5° CEO Philipp Schröder.
It aims to launch the full-black modules, featuring TOPcon solar cells with an efficiency rating of 21.5%, in the second quarter of 2023. It plans to offer a 25-year product warranty.
In addition, 1Komma5° will continue to offer its customers brands from established manufacturers. In August, it opened its first nationwide flagship store for energy-transition products in Hamburg.
The company wants contract manufacturers throughout the world to produce the best possible products according to their own specifications, without having to compromise on social standards or sustainability, said Jannik Schall, the co-founder of 1Komma5°.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/17/permitting-issues-for-solar-on-agricultural-land-in-romania/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,ROMANIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 17, 2022",Permitting issues for solar on agricultural land in Romania,"The Romanian PV industry faces serious issues related to permits for PV projects on agricultural land, as the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR) is reportedly rejecting installations spanning more than 50 hectares.
Mihaela Nyerges, partner at law firm Vlăsceanu, Nyerges & Partners, said that the Romanian government is misinterpreting legislative changes introduced in late June to support solar on agricultural land and ease the permitting process for small projects spanning less than 50 hectares.
“For months, these projects have been rejected by MADR,” she told pv magazine. “We are talking about several GW of mature projects for which the investment process started last year.”
The new rules allow PV, wind, biomass, bioliquid, biogas, storage projects, and transformer stations to be developed directly on extra-muros land under fertility classes III, IV, and V. Prior to their introduction, development was prohibited on such sites. The new rules also state that such land can be used for projects with dual uses, including power generation and agricultural activities.
“All requests submitted to MADR for the issuance of its prior endorsement were simply not responded to, most probably due to the absence of a legal provision supporting a negative response,” Nyergers said. “MADR immediately started to reject all requests received from the beginning of the year, for projects below and above 50 hectares alike. What is also striking is that there is simply no legal argumentation for such rejection.”
Nyergers noted that all projects occupying more than 50 hectares have now been completely halted.
“Such projects cannot follow the legal procedure designed for small projects because they do not fulfill the legal requirements for the application thereof and the procedure designed by the law for such big projects is denied by MADR,” she said.
Projects applying for MADR endorsement are generally very mature projects, she said. The investment process for such installations was initiated at least a year in advance.
“The developers had already made significant financial investments in the projects, either by purchasing the lands or by committing to long-term superficies agreement,” Nyergers said. “The projects are in risk of losing the grid connection rights, as the grid connection permits expire if the building permit is not obtained within 18 months from the issuance thereof.”
As a consequence, Romania may limit large-scale solar to projects covering less than 50 hectares. Nyergers estimates that such projects would probably not exceed 42 MW in size.
“Connecting a PV project to the 400 kV transmission grid entails high connection costs that are not economically feasible for projects below 200 MW,” she said. “Considering also the limited available grid capacity in Romania, indirectly excluding from connection the 400 kV substations/lines restricts even more the connection options already very scarce.”
However, a growing number of large solar projects are now being developed in Romania, including what could become Europe's largest PV plant – a 1,044 MW solar project that was recently acquired by UK independent power producer Rezolv Energy. Developers also started working on other large-scale PV projects after the government introduced more favorable rules for power purchase agreements in May 2020. They include a 111 MW solar project by OMV Petrom, a 700 MW solar project in the municipalities of Grăniceri and Pilu, and another 310 MW solar array under development by CE Oltenia.

It claims the new product is particularly ideal for three-phase storage applications.
“With the ZCS – HV 5kWh battery, we are offering a high-voltage solution that is stackable and easy to mount,” the division director of innovation at ZCS, Averaldo Farri, told pv magazine. “Each battery can operate independently thanks to an onboard dc/dc converter present in each module.”
The battery measures 420 mm x 708 mm x 170 mm and weighs 50 kg. It has a nominal capacity of 5.12 kWh and a nominal voltage of 400 V. It also features an ambient operating temperature range of -10 C to 50 C and an IP65 protection level.
It comes with a 10-year warranty and can purportedly operate for more than 6,000 cycles. A maximum of eight 5 kWh modules can be connected to a single inverter, bringing the total capacity per inverter to 40 kWh.
“This battery works with any ZCS three-phase hybrid inverters,” Farri said. “To operate at its fullest performance the battery systems also needs a base for assembly and support and a battery management unit (BMU) that manages the energy in the battery and the communication flows from and to the inverter.”
The new product will be available for purchase in early January 2023.
“Its configurability makes it particularly suitable for commercial and small industrial applications,” said Farri. “Equally, it can be used on all residential applications where an extended capacity is needed to provide electric power during the non-operational hours of the photovoltaic installations. The lithium-ion technology makes it suitable for high-depth discharge when and if needed.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/17/assessment-of-hydrogen-induced-contact-resistance-in-topcon-solar-cells/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,UNITED KINGDOM,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"NOVEMBER 17, 2022",Assessment of hydrogen-induced contact resistance in TOPCon solar cells,"Scientists at the University of Oxford and the University of New South Wales have looked at the impact of inducing hydrogen-induced contact resistance (HIRC) in tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells and passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) solar cells.
Their study looks at the capabilities of HIRC to reduce the changes in series resistance (Rs) in both kinds of solar cells. The changes are mainly due to the post-firing thermal processes used to manufacture the cells themselves, and are responsible for affecting their fill factor and overall efficiency.
“We show, for the first time, that HICR can be induced in TOPCon solar cells in a similar way as it has been reported for PERC,” the scientists explained. “The application of cycling forward current and reverse bias conditions controls the speed and extent of the contact resistance degradation.”
They conducted their experiment on standard commercial full-size p-type mono PERC cells and n-type TOPCon cells from two undisclosed producers. They found that the degradation purely occurs at the n-type silicon to silver (Ag) contact on both cell architectures.
For PERC cells, the results improved on previous studies by pinpointing the origin of contact resistance in the front contact. The researchers designed and created a new geometry of PERC samples, allowing them to isolate three distinct current pathways.
“These include pathway one: from the front Ag contact to the rear aluminum (Al) contact, pathway two: from the front Ag contact to a modified front Al contact, and pathway three: from a modified front Al contact to the rear Al contact,” they said.
They found that only the first two pathways contributed to change in Rs. They concluded “that the contact resistance at the front Ag/Si interface with the n + emitter is the primary cause of HICR in PERC solar cells.”
For TOPCon cells, increased series resistance is reportedly related to an increase in contact resistance between the Ag contact and the n-type silicon region. However, transmission line method (TLM) measurements also showed that this occurs on the rear surface between the Ag contact and the heavily doped n-type polysilicon layer, rather than at the front surface near the junction, as in PERC.
“In both cases the application of a reverse bias was able to reverse the effect to a certain extent,” the scientists said.
The TOPCon structure differs from PERC in a few main ways. First, it has a higher value of series resistance at the end of the reserve bias cycle, which indicates “a more significant irreversible component,” according to the scientists. Second, its temperature response is different, as it exhibits a substantial increase in series resistance at lower temperatures.
“TOPcon structures show a greater dependence on forward bias current with very small current having almost no impact on the observed series resistance,” added the scientists. “The results presented herein thus have significant implications for the development of processing strategies that mitigate degradation and enhance stability in TOPCon solar cells.”
The group introduced its findings in “Observations of contact resistance in TOPCon and PERC solar cells,” which was recently published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.

The International Solar Alliance has launched the SolarX Grand Challenge to support African entrepreneurship and innovation. The SolarX Grand Challenge aims to accelerate solar adoption by motivating innovators and researchers to provide value and much-needed innovation in the solar sector.
It will select 20 startups and innovators from countries across Africa, and will award a $300,000 cash grant to the winners. The winning entrepreneurs will undergo an acceleration program, with access to African markets.
“The SolarX Grand Challenge is part of our two-pronged strategy to ease solar deployment in Africa. Under this strategy, we are creating a Solar Facility to enable investments to flow into African countries,” said Ajay Mathur, Director General of International Solar Alliance. “Along with investments, a local pipeline of projects will simultaneously be needed.”
The first edition of SolarX will focus on attracting investments in the solar energy sector, reducing the gap between energy demand and supply, and promoting a robust startup ecosystem in Africa.
“With an estimated potential of 7,900 GW of solar in Africa, and only four African nations having a startup ecosystem, there is a yawning gap between what is needed and what is available,” Mathur said “African startups attracted less than 1% of global venture investments. With SolarX, we aim to change this scenario.”
The SolarX Challenge will shortlist entries by April 2023 and declare winners by June 2023.

They initially coated the surface of the perovskite layer with a substance known as 1,3-propanediammonium (PDA). This increases the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), defining the number of photons emitted as a fraction of the number of photons absorbed. They then spin-coated the perovskite film onto an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate and the ETL and deposited an electron transport layer made of buckminsterfullerene (C60).
“PDA has a positive charge, and it is able to even out the surface potential,” said researcher Hao Chen. “When we added the coating, we got much better energetic alignment of the perovskite layer with the electron transport layer, and that led to a big improvement in our overall efficiency.”
Common monoammonium surface treatments do not energetically align the perovskite film and the ETL, but the diammonium molecules have the ability to modify the perovskite surface states and achieve a more uniform spatial distribution of surface potential.
“Using 1,3-propane diammonium (PDA), QFLS increases by 90 meV,” the scientists explained.
The cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 26.3% and an open-circuit voltage of 2.13 eV, as certified by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The cell was also able to retain 86% of its initial efficiency after 500 hours of continuous operation.
The scientists said that a prototype of the cell even achieved an internally certified efficiency of 27.4%, a record-breaking open-circuit voltage of 2.19 eV, a short-circuit current of 15.1 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 83.1%.
“The 2.19 V VOC represents a significant improvement over the previous highest reported VOC among the best all-perovskite tandems (2.05 V), due to the high VOC of the PDA-treated wide bangap subcell,” they said.
They described the cell technology in “Regulating surface potential maximizes voltage in all-perovskite tandems,” which was recently published in Nature.
“In our cell, the top perovskite layer absorbs well in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, as well as some visible light,” said researcher Chongwen Li. “The bottom layer has a narrow band gap, which is tuned more toward the infrared part of the spectrum. Between the two, we cover more of the spectrum than would be possible with silicon.”

Demand for US residential solar is heating up, as energy prices climb and Americans look for ways to save on bills. Power outages and the desire for backup energy storage have been pushing solar adoption as well. Technavio expects the market for US solar to grow by a 10% compound annual growth rate through 2025, reaching $5.99 billion in incremental growth by the end of that year.
However, the US market faces a problem with soft costs – a barrier that other major national markets have largely overcome. Soft costs represent any costs not tied directly to the hardware itself. In the United States, soft costs represent 65% of a project, according to the Department of Energy.
Shawn Rumery, senior director of research at the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said that residential system costs have come down 25% since 2014, but soft costs have dropped by just 15%. Customer acquisition and overhead costs have risen 31% over the same time period, said Rumery.
Customer acquisition is difficult in the United States as residential solar crosses “the chasm” in the tech adoption curve. As a technology is adopted, expectations and customer profiles shift. Early innovators and early adopters – the first 15% or so to adopt a new technology – are highly motivated to adopt solar.
As you cross from the early innovators to the middle 30% of adopters, you encounter the early majority. This is the customer base that is motivated by pragmatic reasons, like wanting to save money on electric bills and having backup power during outages.
Crossing the chasm is considered the most critical moment in the adoption process. For solar to cross the chasm, it must meet the expectations and needs of pragmatists.
