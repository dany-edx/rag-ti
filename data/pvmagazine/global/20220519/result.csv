The new record pushes out NREL’s previous record of 39.2%, and with various innovations the group was able to greatly simplify the device – relying on three junctions instead of the previous six. The previous record for a three-junction solar cell was set by Sharp Corporation back in 2013, at 37.9%
The cell is described in full in the paper “Triple-junction solar cells with 39.5% terrestrial and 34.2% space efficiency enabled by thick quantum well superlattices,” recently published in Joule. The group combined layers of gallium-indium-arsenide (GaInAs), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and gallium-indium-phosphide (GaInP) to create a device that could absorb a wide segment of the solar spectrum.
Key to this approach was NREL’s latest work on “quantum wells,” which allowed it to better tune each layer to absorb a different part of the solar spectrum. “While GaAs is an excellent material and generally used in III-V multijunction cells, it does not have quite the correct bandgap for a three-junction cell, meaning that the balance of photocurrents between the three cells is not optimal,” said Ryan France, senior scientist and cell designer at NREL. “Here, we have modified the bandgap while maintaining excellent material quality by using quantum wells, which enables this device and potentially other applications.”
Quantum wells are thin nanostructures inserted into the cell layers to alter the bandgap and other properties. Using these, the group was able to raise the bandgap of the middle GaAs cell layer, to maximize its performance in unison with the other two. While the QW phenomenon is not a new discovery, various challenges working with these materials at the scale of a few nanometers have limited their practical benefits in previous research.
Space spectrum
The group acknowledged that, for now at least, the processes and materials it is working with on these cells are too complex and expensive for most mainstream solar applications. Though NREL is working on a few different methods that could drastically reduce these costs, for now powering satellites and other space technology – where space constraints mean cost can come second to efficiency – are the only likely application for any type of solar cell based on these “III-V” materials, named for their grouping in the periodic table.
NREL also measured its triple junction quantum well cells under the light spectrum they would have to work with outside of Earth’s atmosphere, and reached a beginning of life measurement of 34.2% – which it notes is also a world record for a three-junction cell under this spectrum.

French retail giant Groupe Casino plans to sell its renewable energy unit, GreenYellow. It said in a press release that it aims to complete the sale of the company by the end of this year, without disclosing further details.
French financial daily Les Echos recently reported that Groupe Casino had started preparing to sell its renewable energy unit for around €1.5 billion ($1.57 billion). It said that French energy giants Engie and TotalEnergies have emerged as potential buyers.
Groupe Casino currently holds a 72,3 % stake in GreenYellow, while the remaining stake is owned by French public investment bank Bpifrance and Paris-based asset manager Tikehau Capital.
GreenYellow, which recently raised €200 million of fresh funds, was set up by Groupe Casino in 2007. In 2016, the solar unit obtained authorization to implement the sale of power to final clients and power providers through its subsidiary, GreenYellow Vente d'Énergie. The company has mainly installed solar projects on the French mainland and in the nation's overseas territories, as well as French-speaking Madagascar.
In 2018, GreenYellow and Engie set up a solar joint venture to develop PV projects for self-consumption purposes.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/19/new-method-could-potentially-produce-hydrogen-from-biogas-for-2-kg/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CALIFORNIA,EGYPT,OMAN,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"MAY 19, 2022",New method could potentially produce hydrogen from biogas for $2/kg,"California-based Kore has developed a new way to produce hydrogen from biogas. It claims the new method could potentially provide hydrogen for less than $2 per kg.
“We produce biogas and biochar from biogenic feedstocks and the resulting biogas contains hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, and carbon dioxide,” Kore's executive vice president of business development, Steve Wirtel, told pv magazine. “The carbon monoxide can also be converted into more hydrogen, and we can use that for hydrogen applications.”
California is a prime location for biomass conversion, as the primary feedstock is plentiful. Kore has partnered with Southern California Gas to develop a commercial-scale demonstration facility in Los Angeles.
“We expect that, as we start to commercialize our technology, the strategic companies that are looking to develop hydrogen, especially carbon-negative renewable hydrogen, will be interested in partnering with our company and potentially acquiring us at some point,” said Wirtel. 
Wirtel said the state could offer more than 40 million tons of biomass per year.
“Apart from urban woody biomass and nearby agricultural residuals, California has a new initiative to thin out forests to reduce wildfire risks,” he said, noting that the state also offers favorable policies.
In the future, economies of scale and falling technology costs should favor similar locations. They will likely be the first ones to see plummeting hydrogen costs. 
“The US Department of Energy has a goal of $1/kg of hydrogen by 2030. So everyone is aiming towards that. And we think that is feasible,” said Wirtel, noting that the process is carbon negative. “With the Kore process, half of the carbon in the feedstock is converted into the gas, and the other half is converted into solid elemental carbon char. This solid carbon won't revert to carbon dioxide or methane. When used as a soil amendment, the carbon is permanently removed from the atmosphere. Hence the hydrogen produced is carbon negative. In other words, carbon is removed from the atmosphere.”
Paul Martin, one of the founders of the Hydrogen Science Coalition, said that biogas should be prioritized, as the conversion from biogas to hydrogen is energy-intensive.
“The reason hydrogen is expensive at vehicle refueling stations is that vehicle refueling stations themselves are very complex. Hydrogen heats up when you expand it, so you need not just high-pressure storage tanks and compressors, you need a massive mechanical refrigeration unit to pre-cool the hydrogen so it doesn't cook the vehicle's tanks,” he said.
Gasification technologies – biomass-to-hydrogen, but also plastic waste-to-hydrogen – are nothing new. But the current geopolitical situation, waste concerns and energy issues are now putting the spotlight on new applications.

The device features built-in solar maximum power point tracking (MPPT) inputs.
“The next3 is not a simple inverter-charger, it is a concentration of innovation that makes it the only all-in-one inverter on the market allowing total control of the energy production, storage and distribution, with the added possibility of interacting with the grid,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The 16 kW next3 inverter comes with a 12-year warranty. It is suitable for off-grid and on-grid applications and relies on two MPPT inputs with an 8 kW plus 8 KW configuration. The maximum short-circuit current for MPPT input is 22 Adc and the maximum open-circuit voltage is 900 Vdc.
The inverter and battery charger measures 320 mm x 450 mm x 760 mm and weighs 58 kg. It has a nominal output voltage ranging from 220 Vac to 240 Vac and can operate with a battery voltage range of 38 Vdc to 68 Vdc. It can be combined with a PV system with a maximum output of 12 kW and an MTTP voltage range of 300 Vdc to 700 Vdc.
“Transforming your home or business building into a self-sufficient system means becoming a full-fledged player in the grid to which the device is connected,” the spokesperson said. “It means guaranteeing a stable supply of electricity. It means protecting yourself against market price fluctuations. Or it means ensuring the daily recharging of your own electric vehicle or fleet of professional vehicles.”

“The cell was conceived exclusively to study the influence of CDs additives over the efficiency and stability in photovoltaic devices based on perovskite,” researcher Juan Luis Delgado told pv magazine. “The stability of the g-N-CDs-containing cells was improved. The long-term evaluation of the performances of the cells showed improvement of the power conversion efficiency of the g-N-CDs-containing cells over time, up to 109% of the initial efficiency after 40 days while the reference performance without CDs dropped to 86%.”
The scientists used 3 mm CDs rich in carboxylic acids on their surface, which enable ionic and hydrogen-bonding stabilizing interactions with formamidinium (FA). For their development, they used a synthetic procedure consisting of a thermal treatment in a muffle furnace of L-aspartic acid in the air at 320 C for 100 hours. The g-N-CDs were then blended with the perovskite precursor solution at two different concentration levels and both were deposited by spin coating on the perovskite layer.

The experimental solar cell was built with a substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), a compact titanium dioxide (TiO2) layer, a mesoporous TiO2 layer, a film made of perovskite with a composition of MA0.17FA0.83Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3:N-CDs, a hole transporting material (HTM), and a gold (Au) metal contact.
The scientists used proton nuclear magnetic resonance to analyze the chemical interactions between the perovskite layer and compare them to those of a reference cell without CDs. They used electron microscopy to study the blends of the g-N-CDs and the perovskite absorber. They conducted long-term stability tests.
“After the first 10 days, both g-N-CDs-containing devices showed improvement in the performances, while the performances of the reference and a-N-CD-containing cells dropped,” the scientists explained. “After 20 days the performances of the reference and a-N-CD-containing cells were decreasing slowly, while those of the g-N-CDs-containing cells kept increasing.”
According to their measurements, the cell with the lowest concentration of g-N-CDs saw its efficiency increase up to 109%, while that of the reference cell without carbon dots decreased to 86%.
“The observed power conversion efficienc enhancement is mainly due to a progressive increase of open-circuit voltage of the solar cells containing g-N-CDs,” they sai9d. ” The less strong interactions between a-N-CDs and PVSK might be the reason why the devices containing these additives are less stabilized than the g-N-CD-containing devices.”
The researchers introduced the cell in “Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells based on Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Nanodots,” which was recently published in Energy Technology. The team includes academics from the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU and the Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA) in Spain, as well as the University of Trieste in Italy.

“SynchroStor will receive GBP 79,560 ($98,200) to deliver a feasibility study of a grid-scale pumped thermal energy storage system which is easily scalable and can be installed almost anywhere,” the BEIS said.
The company's founder and managing director, Win Rampen, told pv magazine that the grant comes on top of a GBP 1 million that BEIS offered to develop the technology in conjunction with the University of Edinburgh.
“We see many market opportunities for the technology. One interesting example is addressing wind curtailment in the UK where wind farm operators are interested in co-locating energy storage with wind farms,” said Rampen. “Utility-scale, island-based, photovoltaic systems provide another example where diurnal storage can help a transition away from diesel generation typical of many Caribbean islands.”
Rampen described the technology as a pumped thermal energy storage (PTES) system that is fully reversible in 30 milliseconds and has a round trip efficiency of around 70%. It is based on a high-pressure, positive-displacement, multi-cylinder ‘compressor-expander’ machine.
During the charging cycle, most of the cylinders operate as argon compressors at a peak pressure of 200 bar and, in the discharging cycle, they act as expanders by returning pressure energy back into shaft energy.
“The power rating and depth of storage are both modular and independent of one another, allowing systems to be sized according to need – with the possibility of later upgrading of capacity,” Rampen explained. “The mineral storage material is inert and inexpensive, and the plant equipment is largely made of steel, allowing for full recycling of the facility at end of life.”
The proposed system relies on direct-contact heat-exchangers, which SynchroStor claims reduce losses during the heat exchange process. It also uses novel “lock-hoppers,” which move heated and cooled storage material between the high-pressure gas system and the unpressurized storage silos.
System configuration
In the charging cycle, the system uses electricity to power the compressor, raising the pressure and temperature of argon gas. Material from the hot-side “ambient” silo is constantly moved via a lock-hopper into and through the pressurized, hot-side, screw-conveyer heat-exchanger.
The argon flows through the interstitial spaces between the material, in the opposite direction to the material motion, with the material getting progressively hotter, and the gas getting progressively cooler. The thermal storage material then exits the heat exchanger, is depressurized by a second lock-hopper and sent to the hot-side storage silo. The gas, now at ambient temperature, leaves the hot-side heat-exchanger and enters the expander where it drops in pressure and in temperature, the recovered mechanical energy offsetting some of the energy used by the compressor.
At the same time, a second stream of material moves, via a lock-hopper, from the cold-side ambient silo through a second, similar, heat-exchanger with the cold gas from the expander outlet flowing in the opposite direction.  Very cold material leaves the heat exchanger, is depressurized by a lock-hopper, and is sent to the cold silo.
“Gas exiting the cold-side heat-exchanger returns to the compressor and the cycle repeats until the supply of material from the ambient stores is exhausted or a command to change the plant operating mode is received,” Rampen explained. “The storage material can remain in hot and cold storage for long periods with very little energy loss, thanks to use of effective insulation on the stores.”
In the discharging cycle, everything reverses. The gas and the material flows swap in direction, the compressor becomes an expander, the expander becomes a compressor, and the electric motor becomes a generator.
According to Rampen, this configuration offers several advantages. “The power density is high due to the pressurized argon working fluid. This reduces the amount of real-estate required by the plant,” he explained. “Furthermore, the hot, cold, and ambient stores all operate at atmospheric pressure, so that they are much cheaper to build and can be unlimited in size and energy storage capacity.”
He said the ability to switch extremely rapidly between charge and discharge modes allows the generator to respond to network frequency-support requests.
“On top of this, the electrical machine is a directly connected, synchronous motor-generator. This type provides spinning inertia, variable reactive power, and unparalleled fault handling ability – attributes that are prized by power companies looking for generation assets that can help to stabilize networks,” he said. “We cannot release a detailed capex estimate, but we forecast that our system cost per kW will be less than comparable energy storage plants. Our cost per kWh will be substantially lower thanks to the use of low-cost thermal storage material. A levelized cost of storage (LCOS) study is pending.”
Synchrostor recently launched a two-year plan to build a pilot demonstrator plant. This system, rated at 1 MW with 10 hours of storage, will be assembled and tested at a grid-connected site in Scotland.
“Our system uses no hazardous materials on-site, no fume-generating processes, and the land area requirement is modest,” said Rampen. “Moreover, it can provide grid inertia and ancillary services.”

Two Australian groups focussed on tackling the growing problem of end-of-life solar panels have now joined forces, signing a memorandum of understanding that will see Reclaim PV and the Circular PV Alliance collaborate on the development of a more robust circular solar economy in Australia.
The pair are looking to ensure solar panels are properly tested for potential safe reuse, rather than going straight to recycling. The partnership comes just as the federal government’s deadline for the solar industry to “step up” its recycling and circularity practices looms in June.
“As there is no legislation in place in Australia to govern the reuse of panels, we believe this agreement [the MoU] is the first step in establishing a second-hand PV market in Australia with the appropriate certification to keep the industry to a high standard when it comes to the testing and verification of panels for reuse,” said Clive Fleming, director of Reclaim PV.
In 2021, both Reclaim PV and CPVA (working with PV Lab) undertook separate used solar panel testing projects in response to the increasing prevalence of functional solar panels being dumped at waste stations.
“Reclaim PV has already been incorporating a series of performance and safety evaluation tests across our Australian solar panel recycling sites with success,” Fleming said. “For example, recent figures from the testing of around 1,450 solar panels at the Rockhampton Council collection site [in Queensland], has revealed that more than 31% could be considered for reuse instead of going through the recycling process.”
Reclaim PV is also increasingly seeing thousands of used solar panels being exported without any testing for safety or performance, creating a potential problem, Fleming noted. “Our testing has shown that a significant percentage of solar panels being made available for recycling suffer from electricity leakage and if these were to be shipped overseas for reuse, they may pose a danger to installers and users in overseas markets.”

The 2.1 MWh DC All-New Elementa is a modular LFP battery cabinet with a plug-in concept to connect multiple units. The standardized design and factory-installed configuration purportedly reduces installation times by up to 70%. The system is designed to make on-site installation simpler, cutting capex by up to 8%, said the manufacturer.
Elementa has fully integrated battery management systems and thermal runaway and safety features such as a bi-directional liquid cooling system, gas sensors, and heat and smoke detectors. On the back of improved LFP battery cell performance, Elementa is able to provide up to 10,000 cycles, which according to Trina, is 25% more than the Tier 1 market average.
Furthermore, the manufacturer claims that its grid-scale storage solution cuts the total cost of ownership by 25% per MWh compared to Tier-1 market average. While massive in size, the system can fit into a shipping container.
Elementa was first unveiled in October last year as part of Trina Storage’s debut at Intersolar Europe. Trina Solar’s storage division was founded in February last year. In the meantime, the business has already supplied its first project, 50 MW/56.2 MWh fully integrated battery storage system in Burwell, England, for energy infrastructure provider SMS plc to provide balancing services to the UK National Grid. The system was commissioned in February.
Unlike some other major PV manufacturers that have decided to step into the battery storage arena, Trina is producing all battery components from the bottom up. “We control the supply chain ourselves,” Ken Rush, Trina Storage's head of product and engineering, told pv magazine.
Nonetheless, demand is ramping up so fast that Trina Storage is struggling to keep up. The business already has more than 100 customers throughout the world. As Rush told pv magazine, Trina Storage is sold out for the year and continues to scale up production as we speak.
Current order waiting times are around six to seven months and a “large portion” of Trina's 3 GWh LFP capacity in China's Jiangsu province, is in production and will be scaled up in the near future. The business has also set up an integration base that enables a customizable battery energy storage system design with an annual capacity of 5 GWh.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/19/is-residential-solar-worth-it-in-the-us/,"MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 19, 2022",Is residential solar worth it in the US?,"From pv magazine USA
When shopping for a home solar system, sometimes the quoted price can leave you wondering why someone would move forward with something that seems so expensive. 
When compared with the status quo, electricity delivered from the utility, the price may not seem so high after all. First, pv magazine will examine the status quo, and how much you can expect to pay for power if you don’t get solar panels. Then, we will examine the average cost of solar arrays today and introduce incentives that boost home solar value.
Generally, early adopters have financially benefited from going solar by securing price certainty and stemming the impact of steadily increasing utility bill costs. End-use residential electric customers pay an average of $0.138/kWh in the United States, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). In California, that rate is $0.256/kWh, it averages $0.246/kWh across New England, $0.126/kWh in the South Atlantic region, and $0.124/kWh in the Mountain West region.
The EIA reports that the average home uses 893 kWh per month, so based on the average retail rate of $0.138/kWh, that’s an electric bill of about $123 monthly, or $229 monthly in California. Over the last 20 years, EIA statistics show that retail electricity prices have increased 59% across the United States, or 2.95% each year. That means in 20 years, the average monthly bill across the United States would increase to $213 a month, and in California monthly bills would be $398 on average.
This means based on historical rates, the average US homeowner can expect to pay $39,460 over the next 20 years on electricity bills. On average, Californians could pay $73,465 over 20 years.
Recent global events show just how unstable prices can be for commodities, and energy is no exception here. What will your utility bill cost in 20 years? These estimated bills also assume that energy use in the home is constant over 20 years, but as the United States electrifies its homes, adds more devices, and adopts electric vehicles, it is fair to expect that many homeowners will use more electricity going forward.
Another factor that may exacerbate rate raising is the upgrade of the national transmission grid. The infrastructure that delivers power to our homes is aging and in need of critical upgrades, and it is estimated that a staggering $500 billion will be spent on transmission buildout by 2035. This half-trillion-dollar cost gets passed down to homeowners in the form of raised utility bill rates.
The benefit of backup power may increase as time goes on as well. Power outages are on the rise across the United States, and analysis of EIA data by the Associated Press shows that outages related to severe weather events have doubled in the last 20 years. Climate change-fueled storms are expected to continue to rise, so the role of battery backup in providing reliable energy may increase significantly.
The truth is, we don’t know how much power will cost in 20 years. Though it has increased 59% across the nation in the last 20 years, there is no way to be certain what it will cost going forward. That is where solar has a benefit over the status quo. By purchasing solar, you are securing price certainty going forward, making it easier to budget and plan for the future.
So how do these costs compare to going solar?
Cost of solar
As a general trend, prices for solar have fallen. In 2010, it cost about $40,000 to install a residential solar system, and since then, prices have fallen by as much as 70%, and about 37% in the last five years. However, prices have increased slightly in 2022 due to shipping costs, materials costs, and possible tariffs being placed on imported solar goods, and these pressures aren’t expected to be alleviated in the near-term.
When comparing quotes, the best metric for an apples-to-apples comparison is the cost per watt. Price benchmarking by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows the average cost per watt for the nation was $2.65/W DC in 2021, and the average system size was 7.15 kW. So, an average system would cost about $18,950. With 12.5 kWh of battery energy storage, the average cost was $4.26/W, representing an average price tag of $30,460 with batteries included.
The prices above do not include any incentives. Currently, the federal government applies a 26% investment tax credit to the system, bringing down system costs for those who qualify to $14,023 without batteries, and $22,540 with batteries. Compared to the potential $39,460 in utility bills, buying a solar system outright in cash appears to show a clear financial benefit.
Many homeowners will need financing to buy a solar system. Shorter terms can achieve rates as low as 2.99% or less, but financing for a 20-year solar loan typically lands between 5% to 8% or more. Based on 20-year, 7% annual percentage rate terms, a $14,000 system would total about $26,000 in loan payments over 20 years, and the system with batteries included would total about $42,000 in loan payments.
Often when you adopt solar, the utility will still charge you a grid access fee even if your system produces 100% of your needs. These vary from utility to utility but are often around $10 a month. Over 20 years, that equates to about $2,400 that you’ll still need to pay to the utility, plus any costs for energy you use beyond what your system provides.
Based on these average figures, a homeowner could expect to see as much as $12,000 in savings with a 20-year financed system. Homeowners in regions whose retail energy price exceeds the national average could see savings in multiples of that figure.
Though in this example batteries appear to be marginally more expensive than the status quo over a 20-year term, they improve the home by adding the crucial service of backup power, and increasingly are being approved to participate in grid services, potentially unlocking additional revenue streams for homeowners.
Another thing to note is most solar systems are warranted for 25 years rather than the 20 used in the status quo example. A panel can last a good 35 years, and though it will begin to produce less in old age, any power produced by a panel you own is money back in your pocket.
Many states have additional incentives to boost the value of solar, too. Checking the Database of State Incentives for Renewables (DSIRE) will show the incentives available in your state, and a solar representative should be able to walk you through these benefits when you receive a quote. State incentives change frequently and vary widely, and in some cases are quite rich, offering thousands of dollars in additional benefits.
Another factor to consider is home value. A study by Zillow found that solar arrays increase a home value by 4.1% on average. For a $375,000 home, that’s an increase of $15,375 in value. In most states home solar is exempt from property taxes, making it a great way to boost value without paying taxes for it.
Bottom line
We’ve shared a lot of data on national averages and the potential cost of power going forward, but is solar for you? In the past, early adopters have been rewarded for going solar, and celebrate when they see $0 electric bills paid to the utility company.
Each home is different, each utility is different, and each homeowner has different needs, so evaluating whether solar is right for your home will take a little time and analysis. Representatives from solar companies will walk you through this analysis, and it’s generally a good rule of thumb to get at least three quotes for comparison.
A great resource for starting your research is the Solar Calculator developed by informational site SolarReviews. The calculator offers a quote and savings estimate based on local rates and incentives available to your area. The website also features reviews of installers, equipment, and more.
Some people will save tens of thousands of dollars in the long run with solar, while others may witness more modest savings. Solar will also provide the home clean, local energy, making an impact both on mitigating climate change and in supporting local jobs.
One indisputable benefit of solar is that it will offer greater clarity into what your electricity bills will cost over the next couple of decades, rather than leaving you exposed to whatever rates the utility company decides to charge in the future.
