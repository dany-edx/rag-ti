(CTIEC) have completed the 133 MW Puerto Real 1 project in the Spanish province of Cádiz.
The plant, equipped with modules from Chinese PV manufacturer Jetion Solar, was connected to the grid on March 18 after seven months of construction.
The Puerto Real project, located in the administrative district of Puerto Real, has a total planned capacity of 223 MW, while the first phase of the solar farm has a capacity of 133 MW, using more than 330,000 Jetion Solar JT SGh395W 1500V high-efficiency mono PERC PV modules.
Puerto Real 1 is one of the largest unsubsidized utility-scale solar power plants currently constructed in Spain, Jetion Solar stated. The project was developed by WElink Group, with CTIEC in charge of its design, procurement and construction.
The solar farm is estimated to reduce greenhouse emissions by more than 175,000 metric tons once fully operational – the equivalent of emissions produced by 38,000 passenger vehicles driven for a year or the electricity to power almost 30,000 homes for a year, according to Jetion Solar, part of China National Building Materials Group Corporation (CNBM).
The project managed to overcome a number of adverse factors, the company added. Jetion Solar faced a price spike in the second half of 2020 and logistics difficulties caused by the epidemic but nevertheless managed to finish the work on schedule, the company reported.
WElink Group project director Victor Jimenez said the companies had achieved a key milestone with the energization of Puerto Real 1. “The achievement was possible thanks to efforts and commitment of Jetion Solar, Elmya, ABB-Hitachi, Isastur, Siemens, PVHardware, PUK Solar, and Procinsa, among others. … This unsubsidized project is part of our long-term development strategy and we look forward to further opportunities in Spain.”
Swiss asset management firm Capital Dynamics last year acquired 100% of the 133 MW Puerto Real 1 project through its Clean Energy Infrastructure (CEI) business and in March announced the acquisition of the upcoming 50 MW Puerto Real 2 project.
Jetion Solar said the Puerto Real 1 project had further expanded its market share in Spain and and consolidated its leading position, noting that the country “has one of the highest solar resources in Europe and a favorable operating environment with low development costs.”

Other projects will enter the implementation stage after completing filing procedures.
GCL New Energy, the EPC and investment unit of GCL group, announced Wednesday that it signed contracts with the Three Gorges Group, a national owned energy enterprise, for the sale of six existing PV parks. Three Gorges Group will have 100% ownership of four parks located in central China and 50% ownership of the other two plants. GCL said the deal would lower its total exterior liabilities of RMB1.3 billion (US$200 million), resulting in a 1% drop in its asset liability ratio. GCL will receive around RMB928 million (US$144 million) in cash flow from the deal.
According to PV Infolink and China Polysilicon Association's latest report, poly-silicon prices are strong and continue to rise. The best mono-crystalline silicon price quoted this week reached RMB131.8 (US$20.4) per kilo, 3.53% higher than last week. However, the prices for PV glass collapsed. For 2mm-thick coating glass, the latest price reached RMB22 per square meter, compared to RMB32.5 last week — a drop of 32.3%. Coating glass measuring 3.2mm in thickness dropped 30% to RMB28 per square meter from RMB40 last week. One business insider attributed the price drop to a reduction in production among PV panel manufacturers, which lead to a decline in orders and a rise in inventory among PV glass suppliers. The reduction in production among panel makers has resulted from rises in upstream costs and higher prices for related components.

Indian policymakers need to plan for rooftop solar+storage, as the combination is becoming increasingly cost-effective, according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (Ieefa).
Ieefa has predicted that solar+storage will be cheaper than grid supply in 2021 for most commercial and industrial (C&I) customers in India. It expects the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for a 1 MW rooftop solar system, coupled with 250 kW of energy storage, to fall to around INR 6.6 ($0.09) to INR 6.8/kWh by next year. This is less than the grid tariff for most C&I consumers and well below the cost of power produced by diesel generators.
“Policy initiatives by central and state governments are already boosting the adoption of EVs, and although slow, rooftop solar and battery uptake is increasing,” said Vibhuti Garg, an Ieefa energy economist. “What’s missing, however, is the opportunity to integrate distributed energy and therefore maximize the benefit of combining rooftop solar with small-scale storage, smart demand-responsive appliances, and EVs.”
The report suggests the technical integration of rooftop solar with storage and EVs as a priority to improve consumer and investor confidence. This covers the quality of distributed energy resource products and installations, integration into the distribution grid, and investment certainty.

The facility was developed and built in partnership with the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, Toda Corporation, Tokyu Construction, Chiyoda Kenko and researchers at the Tokyo University of Science.
American hydrogen fuel cell developer Plug Power and Canada-headquartered Brookfield Renewable Partners announced on Tuesday their plans to build a green hydrogen production plant utilizing 100% renewable energy from Brookfield Renewable’s Holtwood hydroelectric facility. The plant will be located along the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania. “The plant is expected to be online by late 2022, with construction slated to begin in the first quarter of 2022. Once operational, the plant is projected to produce approximately 15 metric-tons of 100% emissions-free liquid hydrogen per day,” reads the press release. Plug Power plans to establish the first North American green hydrogen network and “to produce over 500 tons per day of hydrogen by 2025”.
Australia-based mining company Province Resources began collecting wind and solar data through the Fulcrum3D Sodar monitoring station to asses the wind and solar potential in an area of 1,408 square kilometres in Western Australia. The HyEnergy project could make use of local infrastructure, including the Dampier Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline (DBNGP). “It is great to be able to hit the ground running on the exciting HyEnergy green hydrogen project, I look forward to progressing the feasibility studies as quickly as possible,” managing director David France commented in a note.
UK-based aerospace company Cranfield Aerospace Solutions announced on Tuesday that two new British companies will join the government-supported Project Fresson consortium. “Ricardo UK Ltd brings expertise in fuel cell system development and Innovatus Technologies Ltd brings their innovative Scottish Hydrogen Fuel Tank (SHyFT) technology,” reads the press release. Project Fresson aims to deliver an emission-free (zero CO2), hydrogen-fuel-cell-powered flying demonstrator by September 2022. Cranfield Aerospace Solutions argues that the technology would also reduce operating costs. The consortium includes Britten Norman and Cranfield University. Rolls-Royce is still part of the consortium but is withdrawing from the group. Project Fresson is supported by ATI Programme, a joint government and industry investment to increase the UK’s competitiveness in civil aerospace design and manufacture.
Danish multinational power company Ørsted said on Wednesday it planned to build two renewable hydrogen production facilities for a total of 1 GW by 2030, connecting them directly to a planned 2 GW offshore wind farm in the Dutch North Sea. The green hydrogen would then be distributed through a 45-kilometre regional cross-border pipeline between the Netherlands and Belgium. “The major industrial companies in the region, ArcelorMittal, Yara, Dow Benelux and Zeeland Refinery, support the development of the required regional infrastructure to enable sustainably-produced steel, ammonia, ethylene, and fuels in the future,” wrote Ørsted, saying the companies are speaking with TSOs and local authorities. “Subject to a regulatory framework being in place, the regional network will unlock the first phase of SeaH2Land, which comprises 500 MW of electrolyzer capacity. The second phase of SeaH2Land, which scales the electrolyzer capacity to 1 GW, will require the possibility to connect to a national hydrogen backbone.”
Gas infrastructure operator Enagás signed an agreement with France's Teréga and GazelEnergie and renewable hydrogen producer DH2 for a hydrogen project called Lacq Hydrogen. The project, announced on Tuesday, involves the production and supply of renewable hydrogen from Spain to France between DH2 and GazelEnergie; hydrogen transmission from Spain to France between Enagás and Teréga; the storage and transport of hydrogen through the Teréga network to GazelEnergie's renewable energy plant; and the production of renewable energy via a combined cycle power plant operated by GazelEnergie. The Lacq Hydrogen project was submitted to the Call for Expressions of Interest launched by France in June 2020 as part of an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI).
“We want the [IPCEI] to be adopted by the end of 2021 and we want to define concrete projects between Italian and French companies on the exploitation of hydrogen,” said French Minister of Economy Bruno Le Maire during a meeting with Italian Minister of Economic Development Giancarlo Giorgetti. The meeting was meant to strengthen cooperation between the two countries and define a European industrial strategy, with a focus on hydrogen, microelectronics and aerospace.
The European Parliament's Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) approved two reports last week: “A European Strategy for Energy System Integration” and “A European Strategy for Hydrogen”. The European Parliament “believes that the classification of the different forms of hydrogen should be determined according to an independent, science-based assessment, stepping away from the commonly used colour-based approach; is of the opinion that this classification should be based on the hydrogen lifecycle,” reads the final version of the document on hydrogen. The report also asks the Commission to stimulate innovation across the entire hydrogen value chain. “The report is well-balanced and clearly acknowledges renewable hydrogen as the most sustainable and future-proof solution,” said Aurelie Beauvais, deputy CEO and policy director at SolarPower Europe. “While the report keeps the door open for low-carbon hydrogen sources, it is critical to ensure such technologies abide by the highest sustainability standards, and remain transitional solutions to avoid any investments in stranded assets.”
German multinational chemical company Wacker Chemie announced on Wednesday that its project funding proposal to the European Union for production of green hydrogen and renewable methanol at its Burghausen site had reached the next selection stage. “The requested support is in the high double-digit millions,” said the company in a press release, noting that the EU’s Innovation Fund has a budget of €10 billion to support innovative low-carbon technologies for energy-intensive industries until 2030. The Munich-based company wants to build a 20 MW electrolysis plant with multinational chemical company Linde to produce hydrogen from water using renewable electricity. The €100 million project includes a synthesis plant to process the green hydrogen into renewable methanol using carbon dioxide from existing production processes. The synthesis plant’s expected capacity is 15,000 metric tons per year.
Eurogas, the European gas industry association representing 56 companies and associations, has increased its ambition to develop a carbon neutral gas sector, saying it can achieve the goal “not much later than 2045,” well before its previous 2050 target. The association also called for “binding targets for the reduction of green-house gas emissions from gas, and targets for volumes of renewable gas consumed in the EU by 2030”.

For anti-reflective coatings (ARCs), now widely applied to frontside glass during module production, emerging tandem and multijunction cell concepts present a new challenge. These cells are tuned to absorb a larger range of the solar spectrum, meaning more work for the ARC to minimize reflection across a wider range.
Scientists at the Polytechnic University of Madrid sought to get ahead of this issue, analyzing the role of ARCs in some of the III-V multijunction cell concepts already in use for niche applications such as powering satellites and space exploration. Their full investigation is published in the journal Solar Energy, under the title High-low refractive index stacks for broadband antireflection coatings for multijunction solar cells.
In the paper, the group notes that recent approaches to improving ARCs often include the addition of extra layers to the coating, or the use of complex nanostructures or plasmonics to form the coatings – all of which add more complexity and material consumption to the manufacturing process.
With this in mind, the scientists stuck to approaches that rely on combinations of just two materials – pairs of thin layers alternating between materials with high and low refractive indices. The group has developed an algorithm to calculate optimal coating designs for two different types of III-V solar cell, and demonstrated that the high-low refractive index combination can lead to significant improvements in cell efficiency.
In simulations with various cell technologies, this approach showed efficiency increases between 1 and 5% attributed to the coating design. In comparison to processes currently used to deposit ARCs on multijunction solar cells, the group also notes several potential advantages in mass production for its ‘High-Low Refractive Index Stacks’ approach, which it says has already been implemented for glass coatings in other industries, and that equipment currently used in PV could be adapted.
“The advantage of HLIS ARC is that only two materials are used which reduce the demand of new materials compared to a multi-layer step down ARC (e.g. triple or quadruple layer ARC),” the scientists conclude. “This simple technical solution together with the fact that HLIS seem to be largely immune to small variations in step thickness show promise for their practical applicability.”

Norwegian solar module manufacturer REC, a unit of Chinese chemical company Chemchina, has postponed to the second quarter the final investment decision on the construction of a heterojunction PV module factory at the eastern part of the ZACEuropole II industrial area in Hambach, near Sarreguemines, in the northeastern French region of Moselle.
This emerges from a document published by the French National Commission of Public Debate (CNDP) on the public consultation the company started in February on the project. The manufacturer specified that a public enquiry on the ongoing administrative proceedings with local authorities should take place in May. “These will be the decisive factor in REC Solar France's final decision to create a photovoltaic panel manufacturing plant in Hambach,” it further explained. “The finalizing of financing is now scheduled for the second quarter of 2021.”
REC is planning to produce modules at the facility with a product design already used on a smaller scale at its site in Singapore and based on research by the French Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (CEA), through the Institute National Solar Energy Authority (INES).
According to the preliminary consultation document, the new factory will cover almost 148,000 square meters. The start of work is expected in June 2021. Everything will be done on-site: production of cells, assembly of modules and quality control as well as receipt of raw materials and shipment of finished products. The plant is scheduled to begin operations in 2022, with 2 GWp produced per year before reaching its cruising speed in 2025, with 4 GWp per year – 9 million photovoltaic panels manufactured annually.
REC is planning to invest €680 million in the project.

The company, a 50/50 joint venture between the country's government and UK-based diamond company De Beers, said the Gaborone mine had a maximum design capacity of 3.5 MW and an actual maximum demand of about 1 MW.
“The 600 kW plant will be an upgrade of a 350 kW plant that is under construction [and] expected to be commissioned by the end of April 2021,” the company stated in the tender document. “Once upgraded, the solar PV plant will have a total capacity of 950 kW.”
Interested developers will have time until April 19 to submit their offers.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency, Botswana had only 3 MW of installed PV power at the end of 2019. The country is seeking to deploy rooftop PV through a net-metering scheme, and large scale projects via several tenders. Furthermore, Giyani Metals Corp, a Canada-based company owning the K.Hill manganese project in southern Botswana, recently concluded the feasibility study for the construction of a solar park at the mining site.

The cell was fabricated with a very tiny absorber based on monograin powders that are 10-30μm thick, which the researchers said compares to absorbers made of silicon that are generally 150-200μm thick. “A solar cell absorber should be able to absorb light as efficiently as possible, in particular to harness the full spectrum of wavelengths in solar radiation,” the researchers explained. “In addition, the absorption coefficient of the absorber material must be as high as possible, which means that, already, a very thin layer of the absorber should absorb all the incident light.”
The powders were synthesized by molten salt method in quartz ampoules in a special chamber furnace, which the Estonian group describes as a low-cost manufacturing step. “I don’t have very precise cost calculations at the moment but definitely it will be lower than conventional thin-film production because this technology doesn’t have to use high-vacuum systems,” researcher Marit Kauk-Kuusik told pv magazine. “In the future, all layers and components will be done with vacuum-free technology.”
The microcrystals obtained through this process form, then, miniature, lightweight, flexible, and semi-transparent solar cells in a large module. The device showed an efficiency of 6.4%, which the academics said is the highest efficiency ever recorded for Cu2CdGe(SxSe1-x)4-based solar cells. It was described in the study The effect of S/Se ratio on the properties of Cu2CdGe(SxSe1-x)4 microcrystalline powders for photovoltaic applications, published in Solar Energy.
In 2019, the same research group built a kesterite solar cell with 8.7% efficiency.

The TBEA-owned business predicted further consolidation of the industry which makes the raw material for solar panels, noting that amid “increasingly fierce” competition, businesses “with outdated technologies and higher costs will gradually be eliminated by the market.” That market, said Xinte, displays “a well-defined oligopoly competition pattern.”
Hong Kong-listed Xinte is an exemplar of the industry, with its latest impressive set of returns being largely generated by the additional 36,000-tons-per-year capacity of production lines it brought into play last year.
That new fab saw Xinte manufacture 66,300 tons of poly last year, 87% more than it sent out through the factory doors in 2019, and helped the business to a 73% rise in net profit, to RMB695 million (US$106 million), on the back of revenue which, at RMB13.5 billion (US$2.05 billion), was up 55%, year-on-year.
With four-year supply deals for 367,200 tons of polysilicon inked with solar manufacturers JA Solar and Longi in September and December, the resulting regular revenue stream will give Xinte added confidence as it presses ahead with more ambitious plans for 100,000 tons more annual production capacity in Baotou City, in the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia.
Xinte was also keen to mention technological progress, as displayed by patent prizes it secured in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, and its solar project development and management operation. The company's solar portfolio includes a 300 MW unsubsidized ‘grid parity‘ solar plant in a former coal mining area of Jiaokou county, Shanxi province.
With most of the numbers going the right way–even if cash reserves shrank from RMB2.75 billion (US$418 million) to RMB1.77 billion, from 2019–Xinte confidently stated: “The low carbon energy transition is an irresistible trend.”

AGL Energy has updated its plans for its Loy Yang power station in the Latrobe Valley, in the Australian state of Victoria. The site is now set to host a 200 MW grid-scale battery, and the company is accepting proposals for floating solar developments that will contribute to a hydrogen energy supply chain project (HESC). 
The pilot plant for the HESC is already producing hydrogen from the Loy Yang coal mine for export to Japan.
“Over time,” said AGL COO Markus Brokhof, “Loy Yang will grow to a more diverse hub of different energy uses that leverage the unique attributes of the Loy Yang site and Latrobe Valley more broadly.” 
Brokhof said the company aims to develop a distribution hub using assets such as the Antiene coal unloader in the Hunter Valley.
“The development plan comprises battery sites, waste to energy, electrothermal solar storage, as well as site-specific development opportunities using our strategic asset base,” he added.

U.S. President Joe Biden and his team have been in office for just over two months, and they’ve been busy, especially in terms of renewable energy and climate legislation and related commitments. Let’s take a look at highlights on the energy and climate fronts in Biden’s first few weeks.
January
The first significant development actually happened a day before Biden took office. On Jan. 19, a federal appeals court struck down the 2019 Affordable Clean Energy Rule (ACE), a Trump-administration policy that was set to undo Obama-era emission reduction efforts. The court ruled that ACE was “legally flawed.”
ACE replaced Obama’s 2015 Clean Power Plan, which aimed to reduce U.S. power sector emissions by 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. It looked to lower power sector emissions by 11 million tons, which would come out somewhere between 0.7% and 1.55%, by 2030.
On inauguration day,  Biden signed executive orders for the United States to rejoin the Paris climate agreement, and also to block construction of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. One week later, on Jan. 27, Biden introduced several executive actions aimed at tackling climate change, protecting the environment, and supporting science, clean energy, and disadvantaged communities.
The orders direct federal agencies to procure carbon-free electricity and zero-emission vehicles made in America, following Biden’s Buy American executive order, while eliminating fossil fuel subsidies and identifying ways to make federal operations more resilient to climate-related impacts. They also establish a moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal lands, while establishing various working groups and setting a goal of conserving at least 30% of U.S. lands and oceans by 2030.
These were the same orders that founded an array of new government groups, including the White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, the National Climate Task Force, and the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate.
February
On Feb. 5, lawmakers on the U.S. House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Select Revenue reintroduced the Growing Renewable Energy and Efficiency Now (GREEN) Act.
The Green Act would use the federal tax code to help combat the threat of climate change and expand the use of renewable energy, with a five-year extension of the solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and the establishment of an ITC for energy storage technology on a stand-alone basis.
On Feb. 8, bills to create a Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator to finance up to $463 billion in total investment over the next four years were introduced in the House and the Senate.

The University of New South Wales (UNSW) has launched a AUD 2.1 million ($1.6 million) research project to assess how rooftop solar PV and other small-scale distributed energy resources (DER) respond to unexpected failures in the National Electricity Market (NEM), and how such assets can be used to bolster power system security.
The three-year project will identify the best ways to manage the continuing influx of rooftop solar and other DERs, how such assets respond to contingency events such as the loss of a transmission line, and how they can be used to protect the NEM from such events in the future. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), which is partnering with the UNSW and solar-monitoring company Solar Analytics on the project, has shown that the high penetration of rooftop solar presents critical challenges to Australia’s power system security.
Renewable energy generation has almost doubled in Australia in the past five years and now accounts for more than one quarter of the nation’s electricity supply. Data provided by the Clean Energy Council (CEC) shows that the nation's renewable energy generation rocketed from 14.6% in 2015 to 27.7% in 2020, with much of the increase due to more than 3 GW of new small-scale PV capacity added in 2020.
Australia is now leading the world in rooftop solar PV installations, with more than 2.5 million systems across the country. But research project lead Naomi Stringer, from the UNSW’s School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, said there is work to be done to effectively integrate them across the power system.
“How these systems behave when sitting on our rooftops can have material impacts on the broader electricity grid,” she said. “Unexpected events such as lightning strikes and equipment failures take place every day in the power grid. Very occasionally major disturbances occur, and the ability of the overall power system to ride through and then recover is key. Impacts of rooftop solar can be particularly acute during disturbance events when the grid is already strained, posing new risks to power system security.”
Stringer said there is very little data showing how solar PV behaves during contingency events, but noted that there are opportunities to harness rooftop solar capabilities to help restore power system security.
The aim of the research project is to improve data capture, assess inverter behaviour, inform the development of new standards, and set up tools and frameworks for the long-term monitoring of solar and DER asset behavior. The project findings will be used by AEMO to improve planning and operation of the grid power system. It aims to ensure that conservative measures that might adversely affect PV system owners and the public more generally are avoided.
