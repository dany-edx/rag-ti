“The module is fabricated with 23.4%-efficient solar cells,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine.
The new product, when unfolded, measures 2,400 mm x 905 mm and, when folded, its size is 905 mm x 613 mm x 65 mm. It weighs 13.9 kg.
The panel features an open-circuit voltage of 46.5 V and a short-circuit current of 10.8 A. It can operate with temperatures ranging between -10 C and 65 C and is fabricated with an IP65 enclosure. It is encapsulated with ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE). 
“The largest panel we've ever shipped offers tremendous performance while still being portable,” said Bluetti product manager James Ray. “Before putting it in the trunk, it can be folded into a briefcase, making it the ideal solar panel for camping and other outdoor activities.”
The new product comes with 24-month warranty and is compatible with most portable solar generators on the market. “However, it works best with Bluetti's own generators such as the AC200P/AC200MAX/AC300/AC300/EP500/EP500PRO/EB240/EB150,” the manufacturer stated.

“Our batteries are designed to suit the needs of stationary power applications where safety, lifetime, levelized costs, and environmental footprints are key decision drivers,” the company said in a statement. “PolyJoule's conductive polymer cells span the performance curve between traditional lead-acid batteries and modern lithium-ion cells, while enhancing service life and reducing balance of plant costs, due to their no-HVAC thermal management design.”
According to the manufacturer, the battery cells were tested to perform for 12,000 cycles at 100% depth of discharge. The device is based on a standard, two-electrode electrochemical cell containing the conductive polymers, a carbon-graphene hybrid, and a non-flammable liquid electrolyte. Alternating anodes and cathodes are interwoven and then connected in parallel to form a cell.
The battery may be used for utility and industrial applications such as power conditioning, peak shaving, frequency regulation, hybrid power energy storage, and high-power datacenter backup, the company said.
According to the MIT Technology Review, the battery packs are up to five times larger than lithium-ion systems of the same capacity and don’t require active temperature control. The product is being offered in power strings which the company said can rapidly discharge power, up to 1 MW, in less than 10 seconds and be recharged in less than five minutes.
Each power string measures 2.2 m x 0.8 m x 3.4 m and weighs 1,590 kg. Its nominal voltage is 528 V and the voltage range is 158 V to 972 V. The manufacturer ensures continuous operation at temperatures between -40 C and 50 C with minimal capacity loss. The battery contains no lithium, cobalt or lead and, according to PolyJoule, it is from abundantly available raw materials with no rare earth elements.

The overview provides, in particular, a classification of various component failure modes and their potential causes in a tabular form and describes different approaches for data preparation and feature mining. It also categorizes all fault detection and localization (FDL) techniques in a tabular manner.
The review includes a list of all wear-out failures such as bond-wire heel cracks, solder fatigue, die-attach degradation and delamination, aluminum reconstruction, substrate cracks, corrosion, electrochemical migration, ionic contamination, and time-dependent dielectric breakdown. It also categorizes catastrophic failures such as latch-up, bond-wire melting, avalanche breakdown, electrostatic discharge, and secondary breakdown.
Furthermore, the work analyzes the impact of these failures on the performance of solar modules and the inverter themselves, as well as a description of both model-based and model-free FDL approaches and other FDL techniques.  Model-free methods coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) were found to be the most efficient in terms of quantifying the performance parameters. “In addition, AI based techniques provide superior detection and localization abilities as compared to model-based techniques,” the academics explained. “However, a bottleneck in the direction of AI is that there are very few real-time implementations of AI based techniques.”
Their work was presented in the paper Overview of Fault Detection Approaches for Grid Connected Photovoltaic Inverters, which was recently published in e-Prime – Advances in Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Energy. The research group includes scientists from the Jamia Millia Islamia University in India, the Brno University of Technology in Czechia, and the Aalborg University in Denmark. “The future work is further motivated to include the inductance estimation in current emulators as a part of new fault detection approaches and improve the efficiency under high power operation,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/14/war-in-ukraine-pushes-solar-ppa-prices-in-europe-up-to-e0-038-0-074-kwh/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"APRIL 14, 2022",War in Ukraine pushes solar PPA prices in Europe up to €0.038-€0.074/kWh,"European PPA prices for solar and wind power have risen 27.5% year over year, according to the first-quarter PPA Price Index from US renewables marketplace and procurement platform LevelTen Energy.
In its previous report, published in October, LevelTen Energy stated that the market was cooling down. The war in Ukraine, however, has dramatically changed the scenario. The conflict is the latest crisis to affect Europe's renewable energy markets, sending wind and solar power purchase agreement prices up 8.6% to an average price of €0.057/Wh. For solar, they range between €0.038/kWh in Spain and €0.074/kWh in Lithuania.
Despite this favorable scenario, interconnection and regulatory challenges are significant in multiple European markets, especially those related to permits, and further price increases are expected.
 
 
“In Spain, a number of factors are causing a continued increase in solar PPA prices,” said Luis López-Polín, LevelTen Energy's senior business development manager for Europe. In addition to the huge demand for PPAs, “an increasing number of retail electricity providers are purchasing spare capacity to meet their own decarbonization goals and provide green electricity offerings to customers,” he explained. “And after the storm of corporate contracts for Spanish renewables in the last two years, many projects with greater development maturity have found bidders, reducing the total number of available projects.”
As corporate demand for PPAs reaches maximum levels amid rapidly approaching sustainability goals and continued energy market volatility, the supply-demand dynamic will likely continue to push PPA prices higher, he added.
In Italy, the second-largest concentrator of European PPA offerings on the LevelTen Marketplace (27%), the country's tiresome and lengthy permitting process has made it difficult for developers to build fast enough to keep up with demand. Italian lawmakers changed environmental review procedures last year in a bid to streamline and speed up the process, but it will take time to see these changes reflected in the market. Italian solar PPA prices have soared more than 23% year on year and currently stand at €0.0515/kWh.
This quarter, for the first time, Portuguese solar energy is included in the LevelTen Energy PPA Price Index. Frederico Carita, director of LevelTen Energy's developer services for Europe, states that “in Portugal, we are seeing an increase in available solar capacity as more projects are granted interconnection permits, both through bidding with success in government auctions and normal permitting processes.”
In Sweden, PPA solar prices also rose, reaching €0.04013/kW, an increase of 13.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.

Chile’s Ministry of National Property has announced that it will tender 2,786 hectares in the Commune of Santa Elena, 27.5 km northwest of the town of Quillagua, approximately 28 km east of the mouth of the Loa River, in the Antofagasta region in northern Chile.
According to the tender document, the land to allocate has relative proximity to power transmission lines and is planned to host large-scale renewable energy power plants.
Interested developers will have time until May 25 to submit their proposals.
The Ministry of National Property launched a similar tender to allocate 8,891 hectares in 2019. The first tender of this kind was issued in 2017, six months after the issuance of a new regulation for using state land for the development of renewable energy projects. These new provisions were aimed at making it far easier to use public land for building projects in the renewable energy sector.
Under this regulation, the maximum term of use granted is to be extended from 30 to 35 years.

Maharashtra-based energy company JSW Energy, a unit of Indian conglomerate JSW Group, has energized a 225 MW solar plant in the Vijayanagar district of Karnataka. The project is part of a plan to deploy 958 MW of solar and wind projects for the group's unit JSW Steel, which will buy power from these facilities under 25-year power purchase agreements (PPAs).
“This solar project has commenced operations in a record time of less than 12 months despite several headwinds like Covid-19 related disruptions, elevated commodity prices, and global supply chain outages,” JSW Energy said in a statement.
In addition, the company is constructing another 2.25 GW of renewable energy projects.
JSW Energy targets a 50% reduction in its carbon footprint by 2030 and to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 by transitioning towards renewable energy. The company aims to reach 20 GW capacity by 2030, with the entire capacity addition being driven by renewable energy. With this, the share of renewable energy in the company’s operational portfolio should increase to 85%.
JSW Energy is conducting the feasibility study for a pilot project on the production of green hydrogen, which should be utilized for green steel making, hydrogen-based mobility, green ammonia, and other applications. The company has also signed an agreement with the government of the Indian state of Maharashtra for 5 GW of wind, and 1.5 GW of pumped hydro storage projects.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/14/molecular-thermal-energy-system-can-store-solar-energy-for-18-years/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,SWEDEN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 14, 2022",Molecular thermal energy system can store solar energy for 18 years,"A Chinese-Swedish research team has developed an energy system that is claimed to be able to store solar energy as chemical energy for up to 18 years. The generator is described as the combination of a Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage System (MOST) with a micro-fabricated system combining a thermoelectric generator (TEG) with a low-dimensional material-based microelectromechanical system (MEMS). The MOST device stores solar energy as chemical energy and then releases it as heat that the MEMS-TEG system turns into electricity.
“The generator is an ultra-thin chip that could be integrated into electronics such as headphones, smartwatches and telephones. So far, we have only generated small amounts of electricity, but the new results show that the concept really works. It looks very promising,” said researcher Zhihang Wang.
The MOST device was built with 572 thermoelectric (TE) modules with TE films measuring 1 μm in thickness and a specially designed molecule of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen. When it is hit by sunlight, the molecule changes shape into an energy-rich isomer described by the scientists as a molecule made up of the same atoms but arranged together in a different way.
“The isomer can then be stored in liquid form for later use when needed, such as at night or in winter,” the researcher stressed, noting that the system has a solar energy storage efficiency exceeding 0.70%. “A specially designed catalyst releases the saved energy as heat while returning the molecule to its original shape, so it can then be reused in the heating system.”
According to the research group, the generator is able to produce a power output of up to 0.1 nW, which corresponds to a power output per unit volume up to 1.3 W m−3. “The device continuously generated electricity, for the first time, for over 25 minutes,” they further explained. “Our results demonstrate that such a molecular thermal power generation system has a high potential to store and transfer solar power into electricity and is thus potentially independent of geographical restrictions.”
The device was introduced in the study Chip-scale solar thermal electrical power generation, published in Cell Reports Physical Science. The research group is formed by scientists from the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden as well as the Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the Henan Polytechnic University in China. “A lot of research and development remains before we will be able to charge our technical gadgets or heat our homes with the system's stored solar energy,” Wang stated.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/14/globally-significant-vanadium-mine-in-australia-bankable-construction-slated-for-2023/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 14, 2022","Globally significant vanadium mine in Australia ‘bankable,’ construction slated for 2023","From pv magazine Australia
Western Australian company Australian Vanadium Limited, or AVL, has said feasibility studies into its vanadium mine near Meekatharra in the state’s mid-west confirm the project as a “potential globally significant primary vanadium producer” targeting critical mineral, steel and energy storage markets.
The Australian Vanadium Project, as it’s called, has a pre-tax net present value of A$833 million (US$ 621.1 million) with an equity internal rate of return of over 20%, based on a vanadium pentoxide price of US$10.50/lb (equal to 0.45kg), the company said.
Managing Director Vincent Algar described the study’s findings “significant milestone” for AVL. “The company is now in a position to progress through funding, final engineering, procurement, construction and into production,” he said.
Last month, the federal government awarded the project a grant of $49 million to support its progression, part of a push to end Australia’s reliance on China and cement its place in the rapidly growing critical minerals markets for electric vehicles and batteries.
There are currently just a handful of vanadium mines operating in the world, with Australia home to some of the world’s biggest untapped deposits. To this end, Algar told pv magazine Australia last July that Western Australia could “easily dominate the battery supply chain for vanadium inside and outside Australia.”
The project’s technical studies have now been completed, including three years of extensive piloting test work, which the company says supports robust processing flowsheets.
The Australian Vanadium Project mine is the first in a two pronged approach from the company which will see it turn the mined product into commercial vanadium battery electrolyte within Western Australia.
The company is pursuing these two avenues, mining and manufacturing, as part of its vision of vertically integrate the business and “value add” – moving from Australia’s traditional role of simply extracting and exporting raw minerals to instead creating products from those materials onshore, which typically has far higher profit margins.
Transported from the mine, the vanadium will be processed in Tenindewa, near Geraldton, closer to workforce as well as a port.
The mine has an anticipated initial life of 25 years with the company saying its approvals are “well advanced.” The company confirmed its application with the Environmental Protection Agency had been successful lodged early last year, with its application for the Tenindewa processing plant concurrently being examined.
A financial investment decision is anticipated for the mining project by the fourth quarter of 2022, with construction to commence in the fourth quarter of 2023, dependent on approvals and financing.
Wood Australia, an engineering firm with experience in vanadium and similar mineral processing, has undertaken the engineering and design, providing an overall accuracy for the capital and operating cost estimates of ±15%, AVL said.
The company estimates the project payback period will be 7.3 years after the first production. Its total gross revenues before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is $4.4 billion, according to AVL.
“The positive economic results of the study have occurred in an environment of global inflationary pressure, COVID-19 related impacts and geopolitical instability,” Algar said in the company’s statement. “We have attempted to accommodate potential areas of challenge by building them into our assumptions and remaining agile when efficiency opportunities present.”
“The award of the $49million grant provides further vindication of the importance and relevance of the Australian Vanadium Project and we acknowledge the responsibility placed upon us, as all Australians are now stakeholders in our work.”
