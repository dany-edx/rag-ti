Lagos-headquartered Seven-Up already has 450 kW and 990 kW solar arrays at its bottling plants in Kaduna and Kano, respectively, which were fitted by Lagos-based commercial and industrial PV installer Daystar Power this year.
The drinks manufacturer yesterday announced it will extend the arrangement with another 10.5 MW of capacity at five factory sites in Abuja, Lagos, Ibadan and Ilorin, to ensure there are solar panels at each of its production bases.
With the latest five systems able to provide up to half the daily electricity needs of the factories, Seven-Up wants solar to eventually become the primary source of daytime energy across its Nigerian production centers.
A press release about the new generation capacity, issued by Daystar yesterday, stated Seven-Up saved up to 40% on its energy bills after the initial 1.44 MW of solar panels was installed.
With the latest contract set to take Seven-Up to almost 12 MW of solar capacity, the company would be Nigeria's biggest industrial user of solar for its daytime energy needs, added the installer.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/11/novel-way-to-calculate-levelized-cost-of-hydrogen-generated-by-offgrid-pv/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,BELGIUM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 11, 2021",Novel way to calculate levelized cost of hydrogen generated by offgrid PV,"Researchers at Engie Laborelec, a unit of French energy giant Engie, have developed a new way to determine the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) generated by alkaline electrolyzers powered by offgrid, utility-scale solar power plants.
“The study is exclusively based on off-grid electrolyzers as this is a use-case that we have experienced,” researcher Jonathan Lehmann told pv magazine. “In a grid-constrained environment, due to the cheap cost of PV electricity, powering up a 50 MW electrolyzer with a 100 MW off-grid PV plant coupled to a battery might be cheaper than investing in a grid connection upgrade to purchasing electricity from the grid.”
The current LCOH produced from fossil fuels ranges between $1.34 and $2.4 per kg, depending on the technology and location. Solar-powered hydrogen may already compete with blue hydrogen in certain locations, according to the researchers – particularly in Australia, where an LCOH of $2.36 per kg is already considered achievable.
The researchers studied the LCOH impact of the data used to simulate the PV production. When designing a photovoltaic plant coupled to an electrolyzer, the consideration of irradiance or hourly typical meteorological year (TMY) measurements does not accurately represent the dynamic behavior of the plant. This can cause an underestimation of the power produced by the solar plant and, as a consequence, an overestimation of the LCOH.
Their analysis was conducted on a seven-month set of historical data from a 36 MW photovoltaic plant located in Brazil's Rio Grande do Norte state. The LCOH was calculated using power production simulated by two different methods, both based on irradiance measurement.
One of the two methods is the system adviser model (SAM) developed by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). This modeling software combines time-series weather data and system specifications to assess the electricity production of a renewable energy system.
The second method, described as a transfer function method, was developed by the Engie research group on a model conceived by researchers at the Universidad Pública de Navarra in Spain to assess PV plant variability. It purportedly can precisely simulate the output power of a PV facility from incident irradiance measurement by considering the plant itself as a low-pass filter in the frequency domain.
Indeed, short-term fluctuations of power production are caused by cloud passage. Because of the large spatial distribution of solar panels on a utility-scale PV plant, the impact of cloud passage on the power output is significantly lower than the impact of cloud passage on the irradiance measured by a single sensor. As a consequence, the power produced by a solar plant can be simulated from irradiance measurement by using a low-pass ﬁlter transfer function.
The researchers calculated the LCOH for alkaline electrolyzer capacities from 0.1 to 1 times the DC capacity of the solar park. They assumed the inverters of the PV facility would be linked to the grid and that the grid connection would not be sufficient to power the electrolyzer without additional onsite power generation. The cost of the PV plant was assumed to be €600 per kilowatt installed.
The SAM method underestimates the capacity factor of a project and as a result, it overestimates LCOH. The transfer function method, by contrast, more effectively determines the low pass filter nature of the solar plant and was closer to the values provided by the analysis conducted on historical power production.
“It was demonstrated that, with the hypothesis considered, the lowest LCOH were obtained for electrolyzer sizes between 0.6 and 0.8 times the size of the PV plant,” Lehman explained. “On average, a LCOH 4.2% higher was obtained when using the transfer function method as compared to the historical power production whereas a LCOH 7.3% higher was calculated with SAM.”
The researchers noted that several aspects of the LCOH calculation, such as the price of the battery, were not included. This is because the study mainly focused on the power produced by the PV plant. They will soon conduct follow-up research. They described the novel methodology in “Levelized Cost of Hydrogen Calculation from Off-Grid Photovoltaic Plants Using Different Methods,” which was recently published in RRL Solar.

Those projects may benefit from £120 million ($162 million) of climate change mitigation funding pledged by the U.K. government at the COP26 summit being staged in Glasgow. The funding line will aim to help “build resilience, prevent pollution, protect biodiversity, strengthen renewable energy and better manage waste while also supporting women’s leadership, access to finance, education and skills,” according to a press release issued by the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) on Tuesday.
Solar PV could disrupt the fossil fuel industry and help with two of the biggest sustainability challenges of our times: biodiversity loss and food production. pv magazine’s UP initiative this year shone a spotlight on agrivoltaics. Read our coverage here.
The authorities in Dhaka are reportedly preparing to sign off solar plants including 100 MW projects in Jamalpur district and the city of Pabna; a 55 MW field in the Chittagong upazila, or borough, of Rangunia; 50 MW plans for Dhaka, Chittagong, and the Rangpur districts of Nilphamari and Panchagarh; a separate 20 MW site in Panchagarh; 10 MW in the Sylhet district of Moulvibazar; a 7 MW solar farm in the Chittagong district of Chandpur; and another 3.77 MW in Pabna.
With 450 MW of solar capacity under construction – across nine projects – the 776 MW of renewable energy generation capacity in Bangladesh could rise to 1 GW by next month. The South Asian nation in Glasgow presented a more ambitious nationally determined contribution to the global climate change effort by committing to have 4.1 GW of renewables this decade, with 2,277 MW of it solar.
The solar projects currently being installed include a 200 MW field in the Gaibandha district of Rangpur; a 100 MW plant at the port of Mongla; a 50 MW facility in the Feni district of Chittagong; a 32 MW site at Sunamganj, in Sylhet; and 30 MW plans for Panchagarh and Rangpur.
Bangladeshi representatives were among the nations present in Glasgow who called upon the world's wealthiest nations – and historically biggest greenhouse gas emitters – to honor an overdue pledge to provide $100 billion of climate finance annually, which should have started materializing before the start of last year.
U.K. Minister of State at the Cabinet Office, Alok Sharma, who is also president of the COP26 climate summit, announced the Bangladesh funding line on Tuesday, to mark ‘gender day' at the global gathering.
The information released by the FCDO did not confirm whether any or all of the £120 million – which will be paid over six years – will be in the form of a non-repayable grant, and pv magazine has contacted the government department to seek clarification.
“Gender and climate are profoundly intertwined,” said Sharma in Glasgow. “We see that in terms of the impact of climate change, which affects women and girls disproportionately. And we see it in terms of tackling climate change, where we know our efforts are more effective when women and girls are at their heart.”

The European Commission supports the ambitious project under the Horizon 2020 (H2020) program. It is designed to demonstrate different ways to pair PV and PVT solar panels with heat pump technology for heating and cooling applications across several pilot sites around Europe.
Initially, the three companies installed heat pumps with solar energy system using hybrid panels on two homes in Riga, Latvia.
“Latvia has the highest gas grid penetration in Europe and has rolled out a large number of heat pumps throughout the country,” the consortium said. “The data collected may prove to be particularly informative due to the harshness of the winters there.”
A Boostheat heat pump will provide space heating and domestic hot water for the two homes, while the Dualsun panels will produce power for heating and domestic appliances. They will also generate as much heat as possible, with excess power to be injected into the grid. A cloud-based monitoring platform will evaluate performance data and key performance indicators.
The consortium also includes France's National Solar Energy Institute (INES) – a unit of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) – and Schneider Electric. It has already developed five different designs for the coupling of heat pumps and solar panels, known as Technology Packages (TPs). Each design may include different technologies developed by the consortium's members.
The technologies are a gas-driven HP consisting of one or more thermal compressors in parallel developed by Boostheat, and a hybrid unit connected in parallel with a thermally driven adsorption chiller, using water (R718) as a refrigerant and a vapour compression manufactured by German specialist Fahrenheit. There are also two types of reversible brine-water and air-water heat pumps from Dutch supplier BDR Thermea Group, a high vacuum flat plate solar thermal technology developed by Switzerland's TPV Solar, Dualsun panels, and a thermal storage solution made by Germany-based Ratiotherm.
The first solution uses TVP solar collectors to cover most of the household's space heating and domestic hot water and a gas-driven heat pump to cover non-solar periods. With the second proposal, the thermal output of the PVT panels helps the evaporator and covers preheating of demand, which improves HP performance. PV will be used to cover power demand.
Via the third solution, the household's heating demand is covered by the PVT panels in winter. In the summer, PV output drives the adsorption chiller to meet the space cooling needs. Under the fourth approach, the heat pump benefits from the thermal and electric outputs of the PVT panels and is used as backup.
The fifth design includes solar panels, a storage tank, a hybrid chiller and a thermal heat pump. Hot water produced is produced by the solar module and is stored in the high stratification tank. The chilled water produced by the chiller is stored in a smaller tank and then delivered to the space cooling system. During the winter, the preheated water by the solar panels is delivered to the gas-driven heat pump. If necessary, it heats it up to cover space heating and domestic water demand.
The consortium is now testing all of the approaches at eight demonstration sites in Latvia, Germany, Spain, and Belgium.

Solartek is producing CIGS solar films, on equipment supplied by Sweden’s Midsummer, on a pilot line.
Russia is continuing to support pilot production of BIPV products. Solartek has begun producing small volumes of Copper Indium Gallium Di-Selenide (CIGS) thin films, with some integrated into trial rooftop projects in St. Petersburg. The light and flexible thin film products can assist with the decarbonization of Russian cities, Solartek’s Dmitry Krakhin said during a recent presentation.
The made-in-Russia thin-film products require 10 times less weight to generate 1 kW – only 3 kg per 1 sq. m. According to Solartek, the thickness of the module is limited to 2 mm, which means that the panel looks like a roof layer and not a bulky, glass module.
The serial production of thin-film solar panels will begin at the SteelSun plant currently under construction in the city of Saransk, 650-km north-east of Moscow. The first stage is slated to become operational at the end of 2021.
“The first Russian plant for the production of flexible solar panels under the SteelSun brand will be located in Saransk on the basis of the Center for Nanotechnologies and Nanomaterials of the Republic of Mordovia. At the first stage, the plant is designed to produce photovoltaic elements with a total capacity of 5 MW [per year],” Rosnano's press office commented, adding that the production capacity would be expanded to 10 MW in the coming years.
Rusnano is a Russian state-owned body that facilitates the development of nanotechnology projects.
The production line for the integrated solar panels was delivered by Midsummer under the agreement on non-silicone flexible photoelectric device market development in Russia and the Eurasian Economic Union, concluded between Rusnano and Swedish Midsummer in September 2019.
To conduct field trials, Solartek has manufactured nearly 1,000 solar cells, some of which have been used in the St. Petersburg project. The company has said that its R&D division would conduct a throughout upgrade of the Swedish PV technology, “to improve its effectiveness and cut production costs.”
The average efficiency of the modules produced at the SteelSun facility is approximately 15%. They will offer operational benefits, when compared to conventional crystalline silicon modules, in diffuse light and partial shading.
Solartek earlier reported that the SteelSun plant is designed to meet the demand from the commercial sector for integrated solar roofs in Russia, while in the future when the mechanism of green tariffs is fully operational in the country, solar roofs will also interest the owners of cottages.
The main sales markets are expected to be the countries of the Eurasia Economic Union: Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. However, Rusnano said that customers from some non-CIS countries also expressed interest in the SteelSun solar panels, not providing any additional details.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/11/rear-side-passivation-for-17-4-efficient-cdte-thin-film/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,OHIO,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"NOVEMBER 11, 2021",Rear-side passivation for 17.4% efficient CdTe thin film,"Currently accounting for around 5% of the market for solar modules, cadmium telluride is well established as a thin-film PV material, thanks largely to U.S. manufacturer First Solar. Though lower efficiency than today’s silicon modules, the material is able to compete on manufacturing cost, and there is plenty of room to push for higher efficiencies.
Much of the recent research into CdTe has focused on improving performance through the interface between layers at the front of the cell. And improvements here have now begun to shine a light on the limitations caused at the rear surface. This was the focus for scientists at the University of Toledo in the United States, who trialed a new material as a passivation layer on the rear side of a CdTe cell.
The group worked with solution-processed copper-aluminum oxide (CuxAlOy), and demonstrated that incorporating this material into the back surface of the cell led to improvements in performance. The work is described in full in the paper Improving CdSeTe Devices With a Back Buffer Layer of CuxAlOy, soon to be published in the IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics.
“We do not evaluate production cost,” University of Toledo researcher Manoj K Jamarkattel told pv magazine. “However, the outcomes of this research mainly focused to increase carrier lifetime and improve overall device efficiency which will obviously reduce dollars/watts for other production companies.”
Cells fabricated with the CuxAlOy layer reached efficiencies up to 17.4%, compared to 16.5% for control devices that the group fabricated without the additional back buffer layer.
Contributing to the efficiency, the group notes that the back buffer layer allowed for rapid improvement to the cell’s minority carrier lifetime, and that furthering their understanding of the mechanisms at work in this could lead to even higher efficiency achievements. “Noticeably increased PL intensity, carrier lifetime >650 ns, and increased [open circuit voltage] indicate that the CuxAlOy buffer reduces recombination at the back interface,” the group stated. “…Further characterization of the device stacks with back-buffer layer is needed to determine the critical Cu diffusion, electronic process at the interface and bulk, and to better understand the passivation mechanisms.”
These cells were produced in laboratory conditions, and though the researchers did not evaluate the potential cost of their approach, they note that improving efficiency could naturally help to bring down production costs.

Project development partner Windel Energy announced the arrangement yesterday, and stated the battery projects will offer up to 3 GWh of storage capacity.
Renewables and storage developer Windel, based in Blyth in the North East of England, said the new arrangement was building on an agreement signed with Canadian Solar in December, to develop 1.4 GWp of solar generation capacity in the U.K.
In both cases, Windel will carry out development of the infrastructure projects up to the ready-to-build stage, with Canadian Solar offering unspecified funding, “support” and, in the case of the previous solar project arrangement, power purchase agreement procurement.
Quoted in a press release issued by the two companies yesterday, Gary Toomey, MD of Windel, hinted the latest deal would involve the use of Canadian Solar batteries, when he said: “Windel’s decision to partner with Canadian Solar was not solely down to the current great working relationship, but also to the fact that Canadian Solar have developed and supply their own BESS [battery energy storage system] integrated solutions, which simply made them the perfect partner.”

In a report published at the request of the U.K. government, as it hosts the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow, Bloomberg New Energy Finance included a graphic which showed central business district the City of London, and Bergen, in Norway, lead the way in commitments to phase out the sale of fossil-fueled vehicles.
Both cities, according to BloombergNEF, have committed to halt new internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle sales by 2025. The Zero-emission Vehicles Factbook indicates the Norwegian government has also committed to halt new ICE sales by that date but the graphic has the capital, Oslo, with a 2030 cut-off date.
Pick up the November edition of pv magazine to read about the many software solutions driving the energy transition. From big data and artificial intelligence taking the hard work out of operations and monitoring, to the move toward international standards and a consensus in ensuring electricity networks are secured against cyber attacks and other digital threats; the bits and bytes of software solutions play a complex and central role in the energy system.
A press release issued by BloombergNEF yesterday to publicize the report stated carmakers which account for 32% of global sales have committed to 100% zero-emission new vehicles by 2035. That is the final cut-off date to ban the sales of ICE vehicles if the world is to reach zero-emission road transport by mid century, according to Aleksandra O’Donovan, lead author of the report.
If that estimate is correct, the coalition of governments and auto manufacturers at COP26 which was set to commit to 100% zero-emission new cars, vans and HGVs by 2040, has not set an ambitious enough target.
Similarly, while BloombergNEF lauded the many municipal, state-level and national targets for eliminating the sale of new ICE vehicles, the 2040 date set by the Canadian province of British Columbia, and by France, Spain, Hong Kong, and Singapore, needs to come in by at least five years, even though the cities of Paris and Barcelona have set a more ambitious, 2030 deadline. Hawaii will also miss the cut for zero-emission roads in 2050 as it is committed to ending new ICE sales in 2045 and, with that cut-off date not even arriving until mid-century in Costa Rica; in the U.S. state-level authorities of Connecticut, Maryland, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont; and in the Texan city of San Antonio, more work clearly needs to be done.
The U.S. state-level commitments account for a quarter of sales in the country, according to BloombergNEF and, when national goals and zero-emission vehicle sales targets are thrown in, the analyst estimated 41% of sales across China, India and the U.S. are committed to be zero-emission units.
The report states improving battery technology and falling costs, faster charging point roll-out, a wider choice of car models, and longer ranges plus faster charging have amped up EV sales this year.
When fuel cell vehicles and part-fossil-fuel plug-in hybrids are included in the numbers, BloombergNEF said, sales will be expected to hit 5.6 million this year, to a cumulative 13 million such autos on the world's roads.
Perhaps even more impressively, the analyst has predicted 18% of the world's municipal buses will be zero-emission vehicles by the end of the year.
The rising popularity of such vehicles has prompted BloombergNEF to raise its 2040 estimate of the extent of the world zero-emission vehicle fleet, from 495 million to 677 million. The analyst noted the International Energy Agency and OPEC (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) have also raised their expectations, for 2030 and 2040, respectively.

With the moniker of “Australia’s hottest town,” Marble Bar in Western Australia’s remote East Pilbara region is famed for at one time recording 100 consecutive days of temperatures over 37 C. Obviously, this makes Marble Bar the ideal place to invest in solar panels, and that’s why the Western Australia state government’s Western Australia Recovery Plan has funded the completion and commissioning of a town battery to store excess solar energy.
State-owned regional energy provider Horizon Power’s AUD 31 million ($22.7 million) Energy Storage in Regional Towns project, which will also see community battery energy storage systems (BESS) installed in Broome, Carnarvon, Exmouth, Wiluna, Yalgoo and Yungngora by the end of 2022, believe Marble Bar’s new BESS will free up more than 100 kW of hosting capacity.
The BESS systems in Wiluna and Yalgoo were commissioned last month, and the towns of Menzies and Gascoyne Junction are also being investigated as potential hosts for a BESS solution.
Marble Bar’s approximately 600 residents will now be able to connect a standard rooftop solar system of 3 kW, which could see their electricity bills cut by an average of AUD 1,275 annually. Moreover, Marble Bar is already home to a centralised solar farm that generates more than 1 GWh each year.
Horizon Power’s Energy Storage in Regional Towns project aims to free up around 10 MW of hosting capacity across the aforementioned towns, providing more than 3,000 households across regional Western Australia with the ability to connect their systems.
“We know customers from across our service area have a strong appetite for connecting their own rooftop solar systems and installing batteries like this one in Marble Bar mean we can help them acheive this,” said Horizon Power CEO Stephanie Unwin at an event at the Marble Bar civic centre to commemorate the commissioning. “This exciting project is just another way we are delivering on our goal to reduce our customers’ energy bills by 10% and have zero refusals when it comes to connecting solar in the next four years.”
Western Australia Energy Minister Bill Johnstone said the BESS systems would make more solar capacity available in regional areas and “is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 13,000 tons a year.” Moreover, “The project roll-out will also support economic development, providing opportunities for local installers to supply solar systems to customers.”
The Marble Bar battery was supplied and installed by Western Australia-based Hybrid Systems Australia.

Jeff Carpoff, a co-owner of DC Solar, who had previously pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering in a Ponzi scheme that pulled in more than $900 million, has been sentenced to 30 years in prison by U.S. District Judge John A. Mendez.
According to court documents and the Department of Justice (DOJ), DC Solar manufactured mobile solar generator units – generators mounted on trailers – for seven years, while simultaneously carrying out accounting and lease revenue fraud using Ponzi-like circular payments. The trailers were promoted as having capability to provide emergency power to cellphone towers and lighting at sporting events.
Carpoff and his co-conspirators misrepresented market demand and third-party revenue leasing for their units, and used false financial statements and lease contracts to cover the inaccurate figures. The circular payment scheme began with Carpoff and others using new investor money to pay older investors the supposed lease revenue that they were expecting.
As DC Solar lost vast sums of money, DOJ outlines that Carpoff and other conspirators stopped building the units altogether, selling thousands of non-existent generators to investors. Furthermore, Carpoff and others made it appear that units existed in locations that they did not, swapped vehicle identification number stickers on units that had been built earlier, and attempted to deceive investors during equipment inspections. All told, DOJ outlines that at least half of the approximately 17,000 mobile solar generators claimed to have been manufactured by DC Solar never existed.
Carpoff and his associates were able to attract investors with the generous federal tax credits related to the mobile solar generator units. The company grew to secure NASCAR sponsorships and a luxury box for home games of the then-Oakland Raiders. Among the investors was Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway, which invested $340 million to garner federal tax benefits in tax-equity funds.
The scheme came crashing down in December 2018, when company headquarters were raided by the FBI. In January 2019, DC Solar Solutions filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 in an attempt to voluntarily reorganize. At the time, DC Solar’s parent company was claiming $1-10 billion in assets and minimal liabilities. However, in March, the case was converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation.
That story concluded in May 2019, ending with the auction at the company’s California headquarters of more than 16,000 Talesun and Renesola PV modules and 2,000 SMA inverters. The equipment was auctioned as part of the company’s $50 million in abandoned solar hardware used in the firm’s trailer-mounted solar generator business.
“The forfeiture included seizing and auctioning 148 of the Carpoffs’ luxury and collector vehicles, including the 1978 Firebird previously owned by actor Burt Reynolds. This historical auction resulted in recouping approximately $8.233 million,” said the DOJ.
Paulette Carpoff and some of the other defendants, Robert A. Karmann, Ryan Guidry, and Alan Hansen, yet to be sentenced, face a maximum statutory penalty of 15 years in prison. Karmann, Guidry, and Hansen are scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 14, 2021. Paulette Carpoff is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 16, 2021.
