And for Europe in particular, which imported 155 billion cubic meters (bcm) of Russian natural gas in 2021 – 45% of the European Union’s gas imports and around 40% of its total gas consumption.
Europe’s reliance on natural gas, primarily for heating, is set to decline over the coming decades in line with net zero targets enshrined across the continent. However, the crisis in Ukraine has quickly highlighted the need for faster action not only in the name of climate protection but to ensure a secure and reliable energy supply.
In terms of immediate energy supply to Ukraine, Barbara Pompili, Minister for Ecological Transition of France, which currently holds the EU Presidency, stated in a press conference today that Ukraine is no longer connected to Russia’s electricity grid, and that European grid operator ENTSO-E is expected to complete the country’s connection the European network within 15 days. Scatec Solar has also said it is ready to resume delivering power from the 336MW of currently curtailed PV that it owns in the country, and that it is able to operate these plants remotely.
Looking ahead to next winter and further, the International Energy Agency today published a 10-point plan by which it says Europe could reduce its imports of Russian gas by one third within a year, without compromising goals set out in the European Green Deal or risking major energy price increases. “Nobody is under any illusions anymore. Russia’s use of its natural gas resources as an economic and political weapon show Europe needs to act quickly to be ready to face considerable uncertainty over Russian gas supplies next winter,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “Europe needs to rapidly reduce the dominant role of Russia in its energy markets and ramp up the alternatives as quickly as possible.”

Birol presented the 10 point plan, alongside Pompili and European Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson, in a virtual press conference earlier today. First among the IEA’s suggestions are not signing any new supply contracts with Russia, securing alternative sources of gas, and to increase gas storage levels over the summer to provide an adequate buffer during the heating season. The agency notes that contracts with Gazprom covering more than 15 bcm are set to expire in 2022. During the press conference Birol noted Azerbaijan and Algeria as potential key sources of replacement supply.
Speeding up the development of wind and solar projects is fourth on the IEA’s to-do list for Europe, its analysis finds that tackling permitting delays alone could put an additional 20TWh of electricity onto Europe’s grids over the next year, while investing €3 billion in incentives covering part of the installation cost for residential PV could add another 15 TWh. The IEA estimates these two measures combined could reduce gas use by 6bcm.
They also recommend delaying the planned closure of four nuclear reactors, and bringing reactors taken offline for maintenance and safety checks back up, as well as increasing the use of existing biomass power plants, which were estimated to have run at 50% capacity in 2021.
Speeding up the adoption of heat pumps to replace gas boilers, and implementing new energy efficiency measures in buildings could cut 4bcm of gas demand this year. Further a move away from gas in supplying flexibility to electric grids, and boosting long and short-term energy storage, demand response and other alternatives to decouple gas from the electricity network could significantly cut gas demand, though it warns that “EU member states need to ensure that there are adequate market price signals to support the business case for these investments.”
The final set of recommendations relates to consumer supply, with the IEA calling for short term measures to raise additional taxes on energy suppliers likely to see profits increase due to high energy prices and to redistribute these to partially offset energy bills, as has already begun to happen in Italy and Romania. It is also noted that for consumers that turning down thermostats across the EU down by just 1 degree could immediately cut annual demand for gas by 10bcm.
“Reducing our dependence on Russian gas is a strategic imperative for the European Union. In recent years, we have already significantly diversified our supply, building LNG terminals and new interconnectors,” said Simson. “Next week, the Commission will propose a pathway for Europe to become independent from Russian gas as soon as possible. The IEA’s analysis outlines a number of concrete steps we can take towards that goal. It is a very timely and valuable contribution to our work.”

“Our BlueStor storage concept may also offer balancing services, including reserve power and demand turn-up, to electricity network operators or electricity aggregators,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine, adding that the intermittent nature of the electricity demand in ports requires long-duration energy storage and management solutions.
The organic redox flow battery is currently under development by UK specialist Swanbarton Ltd, which will be responsible for battery engineering and construction as well as associated controls and interfaces. Houlder Ltd, a London-based marine and offshore engineering and clean technology company, is designing the battery platform and port/vessel interfaces.

The electro-chemistry for the batteries will be supplied by German battery manufacturer CMBlu, which was among the winners of the 2018 pv magazine Annual Award for its organic flow battery tech. Their storage system is based on high-performance energy storage molecules that are entirely organic.
The material used – lignin – can be sourced as a by-product from pulp mills. It is filled into two separate tanks and combined for a biochemical reaction in a special unit. By the company’s account, the material is organic, non-flammable, non-explosive, and can live through more than 10,000 charging cycles. The flow battery system has a multi-cell stack design and is only really suitable for stationary storage applications, but it is easily scalable to the gigawatt region.
MSE International has also revealed that the consortium was recently awarded funding by the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy under Longer Duration Energy Storage (LODES) initiative. “Demonstration of feasibility will support application for a subsequent Phase 2 project that would build and operate a pre-commercial prototype organic flow battery,” the company said in a statement. “This will demonstrate supply of electricity to visiting cruise ships when at berth in Portsmouth International Port. It will also demonstrate the capability to procure, at times of low demand, the energy to be supplied to these vessels.”

“Our system is suitable especially for off-grid communities anywhere as it provides an easy way of getting electricity, water, and crop products for point-of-consumption,” the research's corresponding author, Peng Wang, told pv magazine.
Called WEC2P, the system relies on a PV system to generate power and an atmospheric-water-harvesting (AWH) material to produce water vapor from the air. The freshwater produced by the AWH device is used either to grow crops or to reduce the operating temperature of the solar modules. The system works in two operation modes, which the scientists called AWH-PV cooling mode and AWH-water and crop production mode.
The cooling device consists of a polyethylene (PE) anti-corrosion film with a thickness of around 0.04 mm, polymer-based atmospheric water-vapor sorbents, and a polyacrylamide-calcium chloride (PAM-CaCl2) hydrogel. “The as-obtained PAM-CaCl2 hydrogel was directly attached to the backside of each individual PV cell in the PV panels via its self-adhesion properties,” the Saudi group explained. “A poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) plate-shaped frame was installed by spring bolts to reinforce the adhesion of PAM-CaCl2 hydrogel with PV panel and secure their close contact.”
The excess heat extracted during the cooling operations is used to drive the water to evaporate from the polymer-based sorbents during the daytime. This evaporated water vapor is then collected during the daytime in a condensation chamber that is utilized as a passive condenser.

The surface area of the condensation chamber, which is made of an aluminum alloy with a copper nozzle at the lower sidewall is 1.6 times, that of the overlying four south-oriented PV panels, which were deployed at a tilt angle of 22 degrees. A cotton wick passing through the nozzle was used to help the extraction of the condensed water into a water-collection bottle. “Each PV panel was considered as an independent module and was connected with an MPPT system and a 12-V lead-acid battery,” the scientists emphasized. “Furthermore, each module was connected with a total of 20-W light-emitting diode (LED) light strips as a load to discharge the battery at night when the PV panel was not in operation.”
The performance of this system design, both with and without the cooling system, was analyzed at an outdoor testing facility aimed at growing spinaches located in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia, over a 3-month period during last summer.
The proposed system configuration was found to allow a 9.9% increase in power generation thanks to a reduction of the operating solar module temperature by up to 17 degrees Celsius. The small spinach growth unit registered a crop surviving rate of 95%.
The costs of the systems haven't been estimated so far by the researchers. “The performance is far from being optimized and thus it would be not possible to reasonably estimate the overall cost of the system when scaled up,” Wang affirmed.
The system was introduced in the paper An integrated solar-driven system produces electricity with fresh water and crops in arid regions, published in Cell Reports Physical Science.

Through the joint venture Sun Trinity LLC, the three companies will seek to bring solar power to big electricity consumers via four different kinds of bilateral agreements.
One of the three options offered by the consortium is an on-site PPA, through which power is sold to consumers via installations operated by Sun Trinity and located on rooftops and other locations on the premises of electricity consumers. The second option consists of an off-site PPA, through which the joint venture sells power to the buyer via solar plants that are located outside the consumer's premises and feed their power into the grid.
The third option is a virtual power plant (VPP) business module, through which distributed solar energy and storage resources are managed virtually to provide power grid services. The final and last offer consists of an energy service companies (ESCO) model, through which the joint venture provides energy services to final users, including the installation of a PV system, the deployment of energy efficiency equipment, and building refurbishment.
“The company can utilize Sumitomo Corporation’s and Shikoku Electric’s long-accumulated expertise in the electric power business and a range of related business infrastructures built over years in Japan by the companies while also making use of Sunseap’s world-class capability of engineering and procurement of associated equipment for solar power generation,” Sumitomo said in a press release.
Under current regulations in Japan, corporate PPAs must be made by involving electric utilities, except for on-site PPAs. Both physical and virtual PPAs are allowed. In a physical PPA, electricity buyers pay fixed fees to generators through retailers, including “sleeving” and management fees.

While not suitable for electric vehicles and consumer electronics, the chemistry has nonetheless lured venture capital investment and R&D with a focus on vanadium-flow batteries, the most established redox flow technology on the market today.
In a bid to drive the commercialization of this technology, the US Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has made a third and final semi-exclusive battery technology license available. PNNL has already partnered with two companies that are bringing this redox flow technology to market.
“This emerging grid-scale storage technology has great commercial and energy security potential,” said Allan Tuan, commercialization manager for energy, grid, and advanced fuel research at PNNL. “We are eager to partner with additional industry partners to bring this technology to market and to support expanded use of renewable energies on the grid.”
PNNL has a successful record of partnering with US industry to bring technology to market and vanadium redox flow battery research is one facet of its strengths in grid technology and energy storage. In addition to the license, the laboratory has developed a related, high-performance mixed-acid electrolyte that can store more energy than many other technologies, over a wide range of temperatures. The electrolyte technology, which is compatible with redox flow battery technology, is currently licensed and available on a non-exclusive basis to chemical manufacturers.
“PNNL offers technologies on a competitive basis to potential industry partners with the goal of enhancing national security and providing taxpayers the maximum return on impact,” said Christina Lomasney, director of commercialization at PNNL. “Once we have selected licensing partners, PNNL collaborates closely with them to support and improve the success of their market offering.”
While continuously tweaked in the labs to offer ever better performance, vanadium flow battery technology has aimed for mass-commercialization for over 20 years. However, it has never reached volumes of scale. The installed capacities have grown steadily in recent years though, from double digits to hundreds of megawatt-hours, with major projects announced in China, Australia, and Canada.
Unlike lithium-ion batteries, vanadium flow batteries store energy in a non-flammable, liquid electrolyte and do not degrade with cycling. They hold the promise of 10-hour duration storage, tens of thousands of cycles, and even up to 25 years of service life.  However, to function, these batteries require pumps and aqueous electrolytes that suffer from comparatively low energy densities.

The SK Gas Bakmi Station is located in the Geumcheon-gu district and is equipped with a 20kW PV system and 300kW of fuel cell stacks.
The project was developed by Korean oil provider SK Energy with the support of the SMG's Seoul Human Resource Development Center (SHRDC). “The SMG aims to install EV and FCV charging stations at more easily accessible gas stations throughout the city for better eco-friendly charging infrastructure, and [to] convert them into hubs that supply both fossil fuel and renewable energy by installing more PV panels and fuel cell stacks,” the institute said in a statement.

The demonstrator is the first of a series of refueling/recharging stations that SK Energy and SMG want to deploy across Seoul. The city government has also invited other gas providers to participate in the initiative.
“The SMG and SK Energy consistently submitted proposals to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) for better regulations on installing fuel cell stacks in gas stations,” SHRDC further explained that, as a result “permission was approved for a special case of regulatory sandbox demonstration last May, allowing for the installation of PV panels, fuel cell stacks and EV charging stations this January for the next two years.”
According to the SMG, a new regulatory reform for the efficient use of fuel cells is needed, which would mean an amendment to the Electric Utility Act.

The EU executive on Tuesday published a report into the first year's activity of the huge, up-to-€724 billion Recovery and Resilience Fund (RRF), made up of grants and loans for member states to rebuild economies after the pandemic.
With the Covid recovery plans of 22 member states having thus far been approved, the progress report stated 12% of the €224 billion so far requested for “green transition” spending – €26.7 billion – would be devoted to renewable energy and supporting networks. Drilling down further, the commission said around two-thirds of that figure would be spent on clean energy plants, with the balance funding facilities such as energy storage and smart grids.
Circular manufacturing has been under the spotlight of our UP Initiative. We considered whether adopting circular approaches could create a competitive edge and reap financial and reputational rewards, in addition to investigating what is already being done in the solar industry. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
As an example, the recovery and resilience plan (RRP) approved for Lithuania features help for farmers and other commercial interests, as well as citizen energy communities, to install solar and energy storage systems. A list of multi-country RRP projects also included plans for a €100 million electricity interconnector for Cyprus.
Other renewables-related spending included support for swifter permitting and “enhanced financial support mechanisms.”
Around 32% of the €224 billion green transition support – €71.7 billion – will back sustainable transport, the commission document stated, with the German package proposing incentive support for consumers to buy 560,000 “decarbonized” vehicles and cash to fund 50,000 public electric vehicle (EV) charging points and 400,000 home EV chargers.
A further €8.96 billion – 4% of the green transition spending requests submitted by the 22 member states whose plans have been approved – will go towards circular economy and recycling proposals, and around 1% of the green cash will be spent on green jobs. Croatia, for instance, has submitted proposals to back green traineeships with grants; to use subsidies to back green jobs, including for the self-employed; and to offer skills vouchers to vulnerable groups and the long term unemployed.
Some €5.4 billion of approved funding plans related to “other” green transition-related spending include at least one proposal for “emission taxes on … industry,” although no further details were given.
Other multi-country projects include plans approved for potential “important projects of common European interest” related to green hydrogen and fleshed out by Austria, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Finland, France, Italy, and Portugal.
The summary document only considers the €445 billion spending plans which have been approved by the EU to date, consisting of €291 billion in non-repayable grants and €154 billion in loans.
With the EU having stipulated at least 37% of each member states' spending be devoted to the green transition, the commission said that figure was sitting at around 40% based on the plans approved so far. Hungary, Poland, and Sweden have yet to receive the all-clear for plans they submitted in May and Bulgaria offered up its shopping list in October. With the Covid-recovery cash set to be doled out in three stages to the end of next year, the EU has yet to receive a spending plan from the Netherlands.
The commission said €56.6 billion has already been disbursed to member states in “pre-financing” packages and the first regular payment, of €10 billion, was received by Spain in December. The EU body said it expects to process around 30 such initial regular payments this year, and it has already received requests from Greece, France, Italy, and Portugal.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/03/us-targets-5-million-community-solar-households-by-2025/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 3, 2022",US targets 5 million community solar households by 2025,"From pv magazine USA
The US National Community Solar Partnership, a Department of Energy (DOE) program, has set an ambitious goal of enabling enough community solar projects to power the equivalent of 5 million households and achieve $1 billion in combined energy bill savings. This goal aligns with the DOE’s greater target of 100% clean electricity by 2035 and places a focus on ensuring that American citizens can meaningfully access the benefits of the energy transition.
DOE reports that by the end of 2020, about 3GW of community solar in the US was active – enough to power about 600,000 homes. The community solar model only represents about 8% of the total distributed solar capacity in the United States. This target would entail a jump from 3GW installed capacity to 20GW by 2025. The DOE estimates that customers enrolling in community solar will save an average of about 20% on energy bills.
There are some barriers to entry that have ensured that community solar remains a relatively small portion of the generation mix. Less than half of all US states currently have supportive policies. Many community solar projects face interconnection issues and uncertainty around financing. Currently, 16 states have codified community solar into their renewable portfolio standards, requiring grid controllers to interconnect such projects to the grid.
Income level is another significant barrier to adopting solar. Particularly, owning a rooftop solar system can be difficult to have the upfront funds or proper credit score to qualify for. Households earning less than $100,000 represent two-thirds of all US households but adopted less than half of all residential solar systems in 2018. The contrast is even more stark for those households earning less than $50,000 per year. Community solar may offer a pathway for Americans that would otherwise not be able to own or lease a system.
Program activities
The National Community Solar Partnership looks to identify and reduce these barriers to hit the topline target. It is increasing its investment in technical experience and capacity building. For 2022, the partnership will invest $1 million in technical assistance, which is provided on a rolling basis to registered partners.
DOE will also launch the Credit Ready Solar Initiative to standardize the process to apply for community solar project financing. Philanthropic dollars may play a role in providing additional lending or grants to cover financing gaps. A Credit Ready Learning Lab will help small or new community solar developers learn about the ins and outs of community solar project funding. 
The program is also developing a tool that matches recipients of other federally managed low-income programs with available community solar subscriptions. This tool can both reduce energy costs for program participants and make it easier for developers to connect with potential subscribers.
Finally, the Partnership plans to build awareness and understanding of community solar through a network of community-level promoters. This is particularly important in communities where there is a history of predatory energy providers, said DOE.
