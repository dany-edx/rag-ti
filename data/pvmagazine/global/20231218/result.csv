https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/18/pexapark-records-slight-decrease-in-european-ppa-prices-for-november/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"DECEMBER 18, 2023",Pexapark records slight decrease in European PPA prices for November,"Pexapark has released the December edition of its PPA Times report, which includes all PPA deals closed in November.
Most PPA prices in Europe reflected lower electricity and raw material prices. The Swiss consulting firm's EURO Composite fell 3.3% month on month and stood at €52.20 ($56.90)/MWh. For comparison, in November last year, European PPA prices reached €94/MWh.
While most countries' indices mirrored the downtrend, with Poland experiencing the steepest decline at -6.6%, some regions saw opposite trends. For example, PPA prices in Portugal and Spain saw an increase of 2.7% and 2.8% respectively. Additionally, PEXA France rose 7.9%.
Although in March Pexapark announced the “beginning of the golden era of PPAs in Europe”, it seems that the forecasts have not been completely fulfilled. In November, 24 new PPAs were announced for a total of 1,132 MW, which is 10 less than the previous month – a decrease of 38% compared to the October record and a drop of 32% compared to the 1,643 MW signed then. In November 2022, 16 PPAs were announced with a total capacity of 1,881 MW.
For Pexapark, the highlights of November's activity include the signing of a relatively rare solar PPA in Germany between Sunnic Lighthouse, a subsidiary of Enerparc, and British oil company BP for 70.5 GWh per year that will generate six new-build photovoltaic projects totaling 76.5 MW. The PPA will begin in 2024 and will last for 10 years.
The consultancy also points out that the Italian PPA market has experienced a significant acceleration this year with a focus on onshore wind repowering reaching 18 agreements, and the trend continues to evolve: four more were signed in November. In total, they add up to 855 MW, an increase of 143% compared to the 351 MW registered in 2022.
Spain, for its part, leads the cross-border PPAs. Under one of them, Matrix Renewables will provide Merck with more than 102 MW of solar capacity over a decade, starting in 2025, for its operations throughout the European Union and Switzerland. The agreement is linked to three new construction solar projects in Spain.
The second agreement, lasting 10 years, has been signed by Renantis, formerly Falck Renewables, with Merck through a 50 MW onshore wind portfolio in northwest Spain.

The project is currently in its “advanced stage” of construction and will cost €1.9 billion to build, according to the press release. Feasibility studies are finished and contracts for two major engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) components have been written up.
“The Project will terminate Cyprus’ energy isolation, increase energy security in the Eastern Mediterranean and encourage the development and export of clean energy to both Cyprus, Greece and the rest of the European Union,” the company said.
TAQA – which inked the agreement during COP28, running from November 30 until December 12 – will explore whether it will join the Greek government-owned transmission operator, the Independent Power Transmission Operation of Greece (IPTO), and the Cyprus Government as shareholders in the project.
In July 2023, French cable maker Nexans was awarded a €1.43 billion contract to develop the subsea cable, according to the press release.
Cyprus’ Minister of Energy, Commerce and Industry George Papanastasiou said the Cypriot government was still deciding whether it would be a shareholder but was “confident” in IPTO and TAQA’s abilities to connect the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern countries. “The interconnection is of crucial importance to Cyprus as its construction will lift our island’s ongoing energy isolation,” he said.
The project received a €657 million grant from the EU’s Project of Common Interest program, Papanastasiou said. The initiative gives funding and expedited permit processes to cross-country energy systems.
Cyprus recorded 464 MW of PV installed capacity at the end of last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). But data provided by the Electricity Authority of Cyprus (EAC) shows the island's clean energy curtailment reached 70% on some days between Jan. 1 2023 and the end of April 2023.

Europe's largest battery storage facility could be built on the site of the decommissioned Brokdorf nuclear power plant in Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany.
The former operator of the nuclear power plant, PreussenElektra, announced plans for an 800 MW/1,600 MWh storage facility. To begin construction, the site operator needs a decommissioning and dismantling permit for the nuclear power plant.
PreussenElektra submitted the dismantling application in 2017 and is still waiting to have it approved.
The location is suitable for the project. The 12-hectare area that must be available for the storage facility could be developed on the site of the former power plant. The company reports that it is not necessary to reseal currently vacant areas. In addition, the nuclear power plant's grid connection is still available and could be used for the battery power plant, reducing investment costs.
The location is also favorable. Brokdorf is located north of Hamburg on the Elbe River. The Wilster substation in the immediate vicinity would mainly transport wind power and faces major challenges due to fluctuating feed-in. A large battery storage system would be particularly useful in this strategic location.
“With the Brokdorf location, we have ideal conditions to be part of the solution in the current tense network situation in the region,” said Guido Knott, chairman of the PreussenElektra management board. “Together with our partners in the Eon Group, we would now like to start detailed planning. We now need planning security for the use of our facility site.”
PreussenElektra is currently still waiting to secure a permit to decommission and dismantle the nuclear plant. It applied for it in 2017. On Dec. 31, 2021, the nuclear power plant stopped operating. Since then, the operator has wanted to continue to use the location to add value to the energy industry, but without the mining permit, no progress is possible.
Once the planning security steps have been completed, capital will need to be secured. PreussenElektra says that it will coordinate with an investor within the E.ON Group, to which PreussenElektra also belongs.
PreussenElektra said it will provide additional details, including the final investment amount, after obtaining all necessary approvals. The multi-stage plan will align with the nuclear power plant dismantling progress. The first stage will be developed on the unused side of the plant site, while the second stage will require the dismantling of the nuclear plant.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/18/not-a-very-special-year-canada-solar-expert-mulls-2022-slump/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CANADA,NORTH AMERICA",ANGELA SKUJINS,"DECEMBER 18, 2023",‘Not a very special year’: Canada solar expert mulls 2022 slump,"On Aug. 25, 2023 the Government of Alberta in Canada announced it had directed the Alberta Utilities Commission (AUC) to “pause” approvals on renewable energy projects until the following February, the Minister of Affordability and Utilities Nathan Neudorf said in a statement at the time.
According to a government factsheet, the pause would allow the AUC to conduct an inquiry into policy issues as well as future renewable deployment, with 13 projects – comprising 4.6 MW – suspended. Along with potential policy reform, the inquiry will also explore renewable energy’s impact on “Alberta’s pristine view spaces” and “electricity system reliability.”
Alberta is one of the country’s most solar-rich regions and clocked in over 1.1 GW of PV installed capacity in 2022, according to the AUC.
Yves Poissant, renewables research manager at Natural Resources Canada's CanmetENERGY, told pv magazine that the moratorium has impacted developers. And although they are still at the table, they are “impatient to get the projects off the ground,” he said.
“They [the government] wanted to look at what would be the best practices in order to evaluate the regulations regarding solar PV on farmlands, and also sort of the grid integration of variable renewables on the grid.
“We're looking at this, and hopefully, we'll find a more appropriate approach to approve these projects and that they are more organized, because most of the growth right now, most of the installed capacity, is in Alberta.”
Poissant said years ago the state shifted away from oil and gas – another abundant local natural resource – and shut down its fossil-fuel generation capacity to usher in “clean energy”. This is why the pause in Alberta, a renewable energy pioneer, has impacted the whole country. “That's where most of the growth in solar in Canada comes from currently. In Alberta,” Poissant said.
Canadian Renewable Energy Association (CanREA) CEO Vittoria Bellissimo said in August the moratorium was a “mistake” that would impact ratepayers, investors and municipalities.
The comments follow the Paris-based International Energy Agency releasing its survey report of Canadian PV applications in 2022. According to the report, which Poissant co-authored, Canada's cumulative national installed solar capacity from that year was 4.32 GW – a 12% growth from the year before. Ontario saw the most installations with 2.7 GW, followed by Alberta with 1.3 GW and Saskatchewan with 73 MW.
“To be honest, when I look at the international statistics I have a hard time finding some exciting things to say about Canada. Canada is a very small market,” Poissant said, adding that 2022 was, “not a very special year.”
“There are more than 70,327 PV systems grid-connected in Canada currently. It's a relatively slow growth but we do see a transition happening.”
Development was encouraged through technological advancements made mainstream, as exemplified by the sale of 117,994 electric vehicles, according to the report. Competitive module prices also helped, with the average price for a standard module crystalline silicon module last year being CAD $0.63 kWh ($0.47) – a jump from the 2021 $0.46 kWh price. The average cost for household electricity was $16.26 kWh with the highest price recorded as $20.98 kWh.
According to the Government of Canada’s sustainable development goals, renewables and non-emitting resources must generate 90% to 100% of electricity by 2030 with coal-fired electricity completely phased out by 2035. “Where we are now?” Poissant asks.
“Most of our electricity in Canada, 60%, is produced by hydroelectricity, which is non-emitting, we have another 15% that's produced by nuclear, so some provinces like Ontario, and there's also another nuclear plant in New Brunswick, but mainly Ontario.”
The authors state in the report that solar and wind comprise most of the added electricity generation, with falling prices and capital costs, climate change mitigation policies, and increasing consumer demand making PV one of the most attractive renewable energy options on the market.
“However, PV installations remain variable across the provinces and territories based on their current energy mix and climate change mitigation plan,” according to the report.

The Charlottenburg district court in Berlin, Germany, opened preliminary insolvency proceedings against German PV installer Eigensonne GmbH last week.
Lawyer Florian Linkert has been appointed as the provisional insolvency administrator for Eigensonne. While specific reasons were not provided in the published notice, it's evident that Eigensonne had long-standing difficulties and was actively seeking investors and buyers.
The Berlin-based company offers PV systems for purchase and rental. This has various effects on customers, pv magazine has learned. Christian Langen, the founder of Dynago, and Tobias Schütt, a freelance consultant, focused their analysis on customers who rented PV systems from Eigensonne. They believe that customers who already have systems on their rooftops and need the help of Eigensonne for technical problems will probably face the greatest difficulties.
“The insolvency of a well-known provider is not good for the entire industry,” Stefan Arnold, the managing director of Calosol told pv magazine. “This leads to additional uncertainty, especially given the current market situation.”
The most-affected customers are those who purchased systems but likely haven't received them. Arnold noted the right of withdrawal, stating that customers could withdraw from contracts if the last components haven't been received, regardless of when the purchase agreements were signed.
Arnold said he wants to “start a rescue operation for Eigensonne customers” with a network of installers.
“For buyers of an Eigensonne photovoltaic system, we build the system with equivalent components at the price agreed by Eigensonne in the purchase contract and regardless of the region,” he said.
Langen and Schütt noted the strategic options that Eigensonne has after the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the banks provide fresh capital or an investor is found. The company could then continue as before. However, a haircut would probably then be necessary and it is questionable whether new customers could be found for the long-term rental model, they said.
The second option would be for Eigensonne to focus on supporting its customers' existing PV systems. According to Schütt and Langen, the third possibility would be the end of the company.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/18/master-slave-technique-for-deploying-parallel-inverters-in-pv-systems/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,CZECHIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 18, 2023",Master-slave technique for deploying parallel inverters in PV systems,"A group of scientists from the University of Hradec Kralove in Czechia has developed a master-slave control system for controlling parallel inverters connected to a PV system.
The research group explained that using parallel inverters in PV systems is a strategy to optimize power generation while maintaining system efficiency and reliability, noting that master-slave architectures, which is a well-known concept for controlling and regulating shared resources, are commonly used in off-grid PV systems linked to storage.
In master-slave systems, a master entity receives one or more inputs and then creates slave entities to execute them. The master also controls the number of slaves and what each slave does.
“Auto-master-slave control is implemented to achieve rapid dynamic response and precise distribution of load power,” the academics said, noting that the main challenge of this configuration, however, is minimizing the circulating current between parallel units.
They also explained that previous approaches on parallel inverters had prioritized stabilization issues. “This master-slave structure allows photovoltaics to supply maximum energy to the microgrid,” they added. “Storage provides system voltage and frequency support by acting as master voltage sources.”
The team said that the proposed control technique relies on four pillars: effective circulating current reduction; accurate MPPT combining the perturb and observe (P&O) method with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithm; rapid response to load and radiation changes in under 50 milliseconds; and a payback period of 3.6 years.
The scientists utilized, in particular, a d-q-0 axes PID controller, a master unit based on a voltage loop PID control, and slave units using dual-loop PID current control. “The slave units' outer loop is responsible for tracking the PV units’ maximum power, while the inner loop is responsible for sharing the desired amount of power with a current that is in phase with the load current,” they explained.
Through a series of simulations, the scientists found that the master inverter connected to the batteries was able to maintain constant system voltage and compensate for deficits in PV generation. The proposed approach was also found to effectively restrict circulating currents between inverters.
Furthermore, they observed that the MPPT operates all solar panels at their exact MPPs with 100% efficiency and negligible fluctuations, regardless of the load and radiation conditions. The control system responds to any changes in load or radiation in less than 50 milliseconds, ensuring fast and efficient operation of the system, they concluded.
The novel control strategy was presented in the paper “Maximizing photovoltaic system power output with a master-slave strategy for parallel inverters,” published in Energy Reports.

The bike paths each span 1,000 square meters in the provinces of North Brabant and North Holland.
The PV module tech offers an efficiency of 21% per square meter. The solar cells are protected by a multilayer of resin and the electrical architecture has been designed to reduce the amount of wiring.
The two cycle paths will produce 160 MWh/year of renewable energy during the first year. The two projects are part of an initiative launched in 2018 by Rijkswaterstaat, which is part of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment.
Solar roads in the Netherlands are not an unfamiliar concept. In 2016, a bike path near Amsterdam was equipped with solar panels and another one was built in 2020 in Utrecht. However, the feasibility and economic viability of solar roads remain controversial.
The Dutch government is also developing “Zon op Infra,” a plan to test the viability of solar power production on road infrastructure. The plan includes the deployment of solar installations along highways and on noise barriers. 
The Dutch authorities are struggling to identify surfaces on which to deploy large-scale PV plants due to the scarcity of land. In recent years, research institutes and private companies have tried to prove the feasibility of solar projects on non-agricultural land, including dikes, rooftops, onshore and offshore water surfaces.

Despite falling module prices and high inventory levels in 2023, the industry has not focused solely on reducing costs and curbing losses. Instead, a resolute pursuit of high performance continued as solar and storage businesses used technical innovation to stand out from the competition. Technological ambition was evident across the board, including among entries for the new Projects category. Fifty-nine innovative solar and storage projects were entered and choosing a winner was no easy task.
A total of 19 independent expert jurors deliberated over this year’s entries, bringing a wealth of experience and expertise to the process. The pv magazine editorial team would like to thank each of them for kindly devoting time to the selection process.
Commenting on 2023’s entrants, pv magazine editor in chief Jonathan Gifford said the innovations on display represented true solutions to the major challenges facing the solar and storage industries. “Solar and energy storage companies continue to demonstrate genuinely extraordinary levels of innovation and roll out new products and services that meet the main challenges of cost, performance, and flexibility. The ever-expanding number of entrants to the eight award categories also speaks to the breadth and scale of the creativity and technical prowess inherent to our industries.”
And the winners are…
700 W-plus power output is a notable achievement in any solar module, but the 2023 Modules winner packs a heap of innovation inside to set it apart. Alongside its heterojunction (HJT) cell, Hyper-ion deploys Risen’s own patented version of busbarless (0BB) cell interconnection – branded Hyper-link, cell thickness at an industry-leading 90 to 100 micrometers, and the option of a steel frame to make a module that truly stands out.
The efficiency and power results are also notable. The module datasheet confirms the Hyper-ion comes with a power range of 680-705 W, in dimensions of 2,384 mm x 1,303 mm, at a weight of 41 kg. Inside are 210 mm half-cut HJT cells.
Beyond performance, Risen has beefed up its warranty, putting it ahead of TOPCon rivals. It offers a 15-year product warranty and 30-year power warranty, guaranteeing 90.3% of nominal power output.
 
 

German company Solar Cooling Engineering (SCE) has taken an innovative approach to refrigeration with its PV Cool Kenya project. SCE has developed solar-powered cooling technology that is based on a sustainable refrigerant (R600a) and insulation materials.
Unlike cold rooms that rely on traditional grid-tied cooling methods, the SelfChill system uses modular thermal storage to balance cooling peaks. Water is chilled and frozen, and stored in a water chiller that provides cold water to a fan coil inside the cold room. In this way, energy fluctuations can be balanced by energy stored in the form of ice.
Battery storage can be added if required, but it is not a necessary component of the system. The cooling unit itself was designed in-house, with SCE opting to create a DC unit that is powered by PV modules.
This year’s winner is Deye Technologies SUN-29.9-50K-SG01HP3 – a hybrid inverter for the C&I market. It is available in power classes from 29 kW to 50 kW and is well-suited to retrofitting. The inverter’s 400 AC output fits with older installations, making it a good candidate for revamping PV plants.
Category juror Cormac Gilligan, director clean energy technology at S&P Global, said there is a growing market for revamping and retrofitting solar systems in Europe with the addition of battery systems to increase self-consumption. He saw the flexibility of the Deye inverter as a noteworthy feature. For example, it can be cascaded into a 500 kW application and work entirely off-grid. The option to connect a diesel genset and charge the batteries that way means this inverter could meet demand in regions where weak grids are prevalent.
Origami Solar is rolling out production of its patent-pending steel frame design with contract manufacturers in the United States. Frames are expected to be available from the end of 2023.
Frames are manufactured using recycled steel in a continuous process that Origami Solar says is 10 times faster than aluminum frame making, producing one frame every 15 seconds. It also claims frames have demonstrated increased stiffness in testing, making modules better equipped for heavy loading from snow or wind. Further testing is underway with partners including the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
On price, the company expects to be able to sell frames at least 5% lower than aluminum competitors. There is a sustainability case to be made, too. Origami Solar has worked with consultants Boundless Impact to demonstrate a significantly lower carbon footprint per module.
Multinational steel producer ArcelorMittal claims its XCarb steel is both long lasting and sustainable. XCarb is a certified low-carbon material and the company reports that it is made from predominantly scrap steel, with production carried out via an electrical arc furnace that uses 100% renewable energy.
The steel producer’s Magnelis steel also boasts sustainability credentials. It is long-lived, making it suitable for solar installations in challenging environments. Magnelis steel is a double-sided hot-dip galvanized carbon steel, coated on both sides with a zinc-aluminium magnesium alloy.  “Anything you can do to make a solar asset last longer is a positive climate impact,” said juror Jenny Chase, solar analyst at BloombergNEF.
ArcelorMittal has a target of achieving a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions intensity per ton of crude steel by 2030.
The US storage specialist Fluence has developed a storage-as-transmission asset (SATA) that can help network owners and operators to manage renewables curtailment, increase the use of power lines, and limit congestion. UltrastackTM, provides network owners and operators with fast-acting response of less than 150 milliseconds and with higher than 99% system uptime to meet the availability requirements of critical infrastructure. Its advanced control applications, some with pending patents, include synthetic inertia, power oscillation damping control, grid-forming inertia, dynamic voltage control, emergency power contribution, and black start.
Unlike “regular” big batteries, SATA projects are operated to mimic transmission line flows by injecting and absorbing power. In such applications, they can be used to bolster or even replace existing power lines, offering infrastructure planners a new, versatile solution for transmission transition.
US-based Atonometrics is targeting utility-scale solar projects with its monitoring innovation, the RDE300i. The system performs in-situ measurement of current/voltage (IV) curves within a string of modules. This allows technicians to get a direct view of the performance of individual modules within an array, and eliminates costs associated with installing and maintaining reference modules at a site.
The manufacturer is keen to point out that in-situ IV curve measurement could be useful on many fronts in plant monitoring, and that it is working with laboratories and industrial partners to develop new applications for the technology.
For now, the use case for RDE300i is focused on monitoring soiling. Here the system promises more accurate results than the common approaches of reference modules or optical sensors – and it can also integrate with these systems so monitoring teams have all bases covered.
It’s high time that we recognize leading module manufacturers in this category and this is no easy task. There is a wealth of module makers with strong track records and impressive product portfolios.
In 2023, the nod goes to JinkoSolar, which has shipped more PV modules than any other manufacturer. In November 2023 JinkoSolar hit the historic mark of 200 GW modules shipped since it delivered its first panels in 2010. The manufacturer has quickly transitioned to n-type TOPCon and the higher efficiencies it offers. In October 2023 the company announced a new n-type TOPCon cell efficiency record of 26.89% for a 182 mm cell.
But JinkoSolar is much more than just a module producer. It has expanded its product portfolio to include battery energy storage systems (BESS) to offer its customers around the world a complete solution involving both state-of-the-art modules and the latest BESS technology.

The German Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) has announced price caps for PV and wind power tenders for 2024.
For onshore wind farms and ground-mounted photovoltaic systems, the agency set ceiling prices of €0.0735/kWh and €0.0737/kWh, respectively. It set the ceiling price for rooftop PV at €0.1050/kWh.
“We are creating a reliable framework for the auctions,” Klaus Müller, the president of Bundesnetzagentur.
Bundesnetzagentur said the slightly lower level will be sufficient “to enable adequate bids,” and said it also considered falling costs for rooftop PV systems. In addition, there were no “significant additional bids above a value of €0.1050/kWh” in the last round of tenders in 2023, it said.
The October tender for rooftop PV systems was twice oversubscribed and the average award value was €0.0958/kWh.
If Bundesnetzagentur had not made this new determination, the ceiling prices in the tenders would have fallen to a significantly lower level, according to provisions issued earlier this year. It would have imposed a ceiling price of €0.0588/kWh for wind power projects and a value of €0.0590/kWh for solar plants. The cap price for rooftop PV would have dropped to €0.0891/kWh.
“However, these values are not sufficient,” said Bundesnetzagentur.

The experimental system utilizes passive cooling, as it uses the latent heat of fusion of PCM and the latent heat of evaporation of water.
PCMs can absorb, store, and release large amounts of latent heat over defined temperature ranges. They have often been used at the research level for PV module cooling and the storage of heat.
“The drawback of the PV-PCM system is mitigated with the use of heat sink fins, which extract the heat efficiently from PCM. Meanwhile, water is still utilized to accelerate the heat transfer process via energy storage and evaporation,” said the researchers.
Presented in the paper “An experimental investigation on coalescing the potentiality of PCM, fins and water to achieve sturdy cooling effect on PV panels,” published in Applied Energy, the system prototype consists of a 5 W polycrystalline PV panel embedded with HS 29 PCM packed to around 0.02 m thickness.
The HS 29 PCM, which has a melting temperature of 29 C, was chosen based on the location and system thermal characteristics. A flat plate of heat sink fins, measuring 21 cm × 21 cm, is adhered to the PCM bottom surface. The system is placed inside a plastic container, with 3.3 liters of water covering the fins.
That system was tested against a reference 5 W polycrystalline PV panel without any cooling. The experiment was done in the southern Indian city of Madurai in early October 2020. Electrical, thermal, and efficiency characteristics were measured daily from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. at 30-minute intervals. Using a set of equations, some of the results were scaled up for a large-scale 1 MW PV system.
According to the research team, the per-day power output in W of the proposed configuration was 8.12% and 9.39% higher than the reference panel. Also, the maximum power obtained from the cooled panel was 20.25% higher than the reference panel.
“The output power of the reference PV panel ranges from 2.579 W to 3.062 W on October 3 while it ranges from 2.785 W to 3.538 W on October 4,” the researchers noted. “On the other hand, the output power of the proposed configuration ranges from 2.538 W to 3.336 W on October 3 while it ranges from 2.880 W to 3.864 W on October 4.”

On average, the novel system helped reduce the panel temperature by 10.14 C. The highest temperature difference, 16.7 C, was obtained at 10:30 a.m. on October 4. When scaled up to a 1 MW plant, the scientists found the drop in temperature to extend its lifetime from 25 years to 31.
“The proposed PV cooling scheme shows a 9.4% additional CO2 reduction compared to normal solar PV,” the researchers added. “A sum of 2130.578 Tonnes of CO2 reduction can be achieved using a 1 MW solar PV with the proposed cooling technique.” They also added that the cooling strategy renders 9.4% energy saving per day, which, scaling to a large plant, means 366.5 MW per year.
Regarding efficiency in relative terms, the researchers found the proposed system to enhance it by 20.3% on the first day and 13% on the second day. However, the average efficiency enhancement ranged from 0.78% to 1.08%.
“The designed cooling system can target residential solar PV panels,” the academics concluded. “This pilot study can also be provisioned with a heat collecting system from water to form a PV-T system. Further, this research paves the way for exploring the feasibility of employing this cooling approach in floating panels since they float on still-water bodies.”
The research group comprises scientists from Australia’s University of Queensland, USA’s University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), and India’s Thiagarajar College of Engineering, Madurai.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/18/nova-scotia-completes-provinces-largest-utility-scale-solar-facility/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CANADA",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 18, 2023",Nova Scotia completes province’s largest utility-scale solar facility,"From pv magazine USA
Nova Scotia has the strongest greenhouse gas reductions target in all of Canada, aiming for 53% below 2005 levels by 2030, 80% renewables by 2030, and net-zero by 2050. With the completion of its largest utility-scale solar facility to date, Nova Scotia moves a step closer to these goals.
The 4.8 MW Mahone Bay project is now the largest operating solar plant in Nova Scotia, with the 2.4 MW Berwick plant also making a significant contribution to cutting greenhouse gases. Both are community solar projects, with the clean energy available to local residents.
The projects are named for and owned by the towns in which they are located, with Mahone Bay being on the south shore of the province and Berwick not far from the north shore. The two projects were developed by AREA, a municipally owned clean energy project developer, along with Goldbeck Solar, an EPC company that specializes in the construction of large-scale solar. In 2022 the Goldbeck Solar Group acquired the North American PV-EPC business unit of GP Joule and is now the sole shareholder of the two North American companies: GP Joule PV Canada Corp. and GP Joule PV USA Inc.
The projects include LG solar modules, SMA Sunny Highpower Peak 3 inverters, and Goldbeck’s own Solar Phlegon fixed tracking system. Goldbeck reports that the Phlegon is designed for “arduous” terrain, as they feature up to 12% slope tolerance in the east-west direction and a 200 km/h wind resistance level.
AREA is owned by the towns of Berwick, Mahone Bay and Antigonish (where a third solar plant is currently under construction). Goldbeck Solar specializes in the construction of commercial rooftop and ground-mounted solar, and has 200 MW installed in Canada and the United States, with a goal to double that in 2024.
“The completion of Mahone Bay and Berwick aligns with our dedication to advancing sustainable energy solutions,” said Aaron Long, general manager for AREA.
The combined energy production of the two plants is enough to power approximately 803 homes annually. The Berwick Solar Garden is estimated to eliminate approximately 3859 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, equivalent to removing 893 gas-powered cars from the roads.
“These projects, along with the Antigonish solar garden that is still under construction, represent our commitment to the Nova Scotia Renewable Electricity Standard of 80% by 2030,” said Laurie Boucher, chair of AREA. “AREA, and the municipal electric utilities that it supports, are entirely aligned with the Federal and Provincial ambitions to accelerate the decarbonization of Nova Scotia at least possible cost to ratepayers while simultaneously delivering rural economic development.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/18/white-hydrogen-project-sparks-interest-in-france/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,BELGIUM,FRANCE,GERMANY,MALI,NETHERLANDS,SOUTH AFRICA",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"DECEMBER 18, 2023",White hydrogen project sparks interest in France,"A project in France, launched in 2018, is now garnering unprecedented interest from experts and politicians. A team of two researchers is investigating a structure in Lorraine which is 150 km long, 80 km wide, and 6 km deep.
While the country is set to stop hydrocarbon exploration soon, hydrogen production is a different political and societal story – at least for now. The geological structures of natural gas and natural hydrogen are also different.
“We think that the methane is produced in coal beds, while hydrogen at a great depth. We need high temperature, and the temperature increases with depth. We consider that the good temperature to initiate the reaction at 150 to 200 degrees,” Jacques Pironon, director of the GeoRessources Laboratory, told pv magazine. “We expect to find this temperature range between 5.000 and 6.000 meters.”
According to their initial results, samples of the coal layer at 600 meters show 1% hydrogen, whereas the percentage goes up to 17% at 1,250 meters. Researchers expect the proportion to further double at depth of 3,000 meters, as the “proportion of white hydrogen in the underground should go up linearly.”
The laboratory belongs to Université de Lorraine and the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). The project is founded by the French government, Région Grand-Est, and the European Union. Rumors suggest that the funding could increase, as it could also come from the central government in Paris. French President Emmanuel Macron recently said that so-called “white hydrogen,” or natural hydrogen, is a priority for the country.
At the moment, the two researchers are trying to test their hypothesis, suggesting that hydrogen is produced at high temperature in the presence of iron.
“When water is in contact with iron, in our case iron carbonate, hydrogen can be produced. The water molecule is broken by the reduction effect, a transfer of electron,” Pironon said. “In this case, the water molecule is broken. Iron, from its original Fe2+ form, is transformed into Fe3+ to equilibrate the reaction.”
The team, whose original task was to estimate the methane content of the Lorraine basin, expects a large amount of hydrogen: 250 million tons of hydrogen. But the project could find even more.
“This estimate could change in some months, because we will have more data. We expect higher content of hydrogen,” said Pironon.
The project was originally set to stop at the end of the year, but it will continue in 2024, given the interest from the central government and the region.
“We are discussing with a lot of partners. The region would like to be the leader of the project,” said Pironon. “For the moment, I cannot say exactly the beginning of the new phase, as we are having discussions. We are discussing to start in April or May 2024.”
According to the researchers, several mayors of cities around the formation are interested in new sectors, as there are high levels of unemployment in the region.
“For local authorities the finding is good news. For the population it depends. Some ecological associations are against the exploitation of the underground;” said Pironon. “It is difficult for them to say they are against hydrogen, but they did not agree to drill. Still, they are a very minor part of the population.”
The team will continue to work with Française De l’Énergie, a company that specializes in the production of gas from old mines, with headquarters in the region and activities in France and Belgium. The team could though include new, bigger companies. The only pending question is the commercial value of this hydrogen.
“I don’t have idea about the production of hydrogen, and I am not sure about the costs. So for us, we are in an exploration phase, and we are thinking about new ways to explore,” said Pironon. “So the costs are difficult to define yet. In the case of conventional gas exploration, an O&G company is happy to find a reservoir 200 bars pressure, but in our case our pressure should be lower, around 20. We are in very different conditions.”
The team wants to develop new concepts and new techniques to cut costs and reduce environmental impacts.
“We want to develop a system to separate gases from water directly in the borehole. This system should also separate the different gases: methane, hydrogen, and nitrogen,” said Pironon. “If we have to produce hydrogen, but not methane, this is needed. So we are working on developing special membranes to be used directly down in the borehole.”
Together with Solexperts, the laboratory has developed the SysMoG probe, able to separate gases from water in the borehole and allowing gas transfer to the surface.
The team is in talks with companies and public entities in Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Germany, which are countries with similar geological formations. On a research level, the team is speaking with engineers in the United States, Australia, South Africa, India, and China.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/18/unprecedented-solar-and-storage-growth-on-horizon-with-record-installations-and-investments-in-u-s/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",,"DECEMBER 18, 2023",Unprecedented solar and storage growth on horizon with record installations and investments in U.S.,"In recent years, the United States has made substantial progress in embracing a renewable energy revolution, positioning itself on a path toward a more sustainable future. This transition is being propelled by a convergence of factors, including environmental concerns, economic opportunities and advancements in technology.
With the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), the U.S. is accelerating its move toward clean energy solutions.
To illustrate the extent of this progress, consider the following key statistics: In 2022, the share of renewable energy sources (RES), including hydroelectric power, in the nation’s electricity generation had reached approximately 22%; furthermore, the share of RES in the total electricity generation capacity had increased to approximately 30%.
Notably, in the transportation sector, there is also a growing awareness among consumers, who are increasingly opting for zero-emission fuels, such as electric vehicles. In 2022, the battery electric vehicles (BEVs) share in new vehicle registrations stood at 5.6%, and by the first half of 2023, the share had surged to 7.1%, according to EUPD Research estimates.
The U.S. has set ambitious targets, including achieving 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035 and aiming for economy-wide net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050. These targets are expected to provide a significant boost to the clean energy sector in the country, further reinforcing its commitment to a sustainable and environmentally responsible future.
IRA and BIL fueling the boom
The IRA and BIL mark an epochal shift in the landscape of clean energy policy, heralding a new era for the solar and energy storage sectors in the U.S. The IRA allocates substantial resources toward addressing the climate crisis, bolstering domestic clean energy production, and solidifying the U.S. role as a global leader in clean energy manufacturing.
According to U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), a substantial investment exceeding $120 billion in the U.S. battery manufacturing and supply chain sector has been announced since the introduction of IRA and BIL. Furthermore, plans have been announced for the establishment of more than 200 new or expanded facilities dedicated to minerals, materials processing and manufacturing. This is anticipated to create over 75,000 potential job opportunities, strengthening the country’s workforce.
After the introduction of IRA and BIL, solar PV manufacturing in the U.S. has also seen a substantial surge in planned investments, amounting to nearly $13 billion, according to the DOE. Furthermore, a total of 94 new and expanded PV manufacturing plants have been announced, which could potentially create over 25,000 jobs in the country.
Surging solar sector
In recent years, the solar sector in the U.S. has outpaced other energy sources, including wind and natural gas, in terms of capacity growth. EUPD Research estimates reveal a noteworthy upward trajectory in the contribution of solar capacity to annual power capacity additions. This trend has seen a rise from 37% in 2019 to 38% in 2020, further increasing to 44% in 2021, and reaching an impressive 45% in 2022.
Annual PV capacity in the U.S. has been steadily rising in the past years, albeit with a temporary setback in 2022 caused by pandemic-related delays, enforcement of trade laws, disruptions in the supply chain, and increasing costs. (The country installed 21.1 GWdc of PV capacity in 2022, as compared to 23.1 GWdc in 2021.)

The U.S. now is on track to make an historic addition to its PV capacity in 2023. According to EUPD Research’s 2023 forecast, the U.S. is poised to achieve its largest-ever expansion in PV capacity, with an estimated 32 to 35 GWdc, if all the planned utility-scale capacity gets installed. Moreover, in the period from 2023 to 2028, the U.S. is estimated to add approximately 233 GWdc of PV capacity.
To learn more about how EUPD collects historical installed PV and storage data and make projections for future installed capacity, see EUPD Research’s Global Energy Transition (GET) Matrix.
In terms of cumulative installed PV capacity (utility-scale + C&I + residential) on a state-by-state basis, California holds the top position followed by Texas, Florida, North Carolina and Arizona. Notably, Texas is rapidly expanding its utility-scale PV capacity, and it is poised to potentially surpass California within the next two years.
Rapid expansion of battery storage
Battery energy storage has emerged as the dominant and rapidly expanding source of energy storage in the U.S. in recent years. The proportion of battery storage in the country’s energy storage capacity has surged dramatically, climbing from a mere 3% in 2017 to a substantial 36% in the first half of 2023.

In the U.S., battery storage capacity additions have been dominated by utility-scale installations. The rise of intermittent energy sources like solar and wind has made utility-scale batteries increasingly important. According to the DOE, the majority of planned utility-scale battery storage capacity is being installed alongside solar and wind facilities in the U.S.
At the end of 2022, around 9 GW/23.24 GWh of utility-scale battery storage capacity was installed in the U.S., as per EUPD Research estimates. Our projections show that in the year 2023, the U.S. is estimated to install a substantial 9.6 GW/26.4 GWh of utility-scale battery storage capacity, surpassing the cumulative installed capacity up to 2022.
In terms of total installed battery storage capacity (utility-scale + small-scale), California at present holds the top position followed by Texas, Florida, Hawaii and Arizona.
Unveiling the top installers
Crucial to the flourishing solar and storage industry in the U.S. are the downstream players, specifically installers. These entities play a pivotal role in driving sector expansion and shaping its trajectory. To ensure continued growth and success, understanding the landscape of the top installers in the country is imperative.
Against this context, EUPD Research in its recently published report “Market Leadership Study: The United States 2023” came out with a ranking of the top installers in the U.S. distributed generation market. We also conducted a comprehensive evaluation of top installers, creating a data-driven snapshot of their competitive positioning. The installers were ranked using a rigorous methodology that considers various critical factors, such as installed capacity, sector coupling, vertical integration, financing options, and more. Each of these factors was assigned a specific weighting to determine the final rankings.
EUPD Research is pleased to reveal the names of the top 10 distributed installers in the U.S., according to our report. Topping the list are industry giants Sunrun, Sunpower, and Tesla Energy, in positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The remaining companies in the top 10 are: Sunnova, ADT Solar, Palmetto Solar, Freedom Forever, Trinity Solar, Titan Solar Power, and Momentum Solar.
In conclusion, the U.S. stands at the cusp of an energy revolution, propelled by ambitious targets and landmark legislation. The solar PV and energy storage sectors are witnessing unprecedented growth, guided by substantial investments and a surge in installations. With industry leaders driving innovation and sustainability, the nation is poised to achieve its clean energy goals, reaffirming its commitment to a greener future.
