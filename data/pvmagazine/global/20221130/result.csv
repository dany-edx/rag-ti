The Japanese trading house will acquire an undisclosed number of shares from Rosi Solar via a private placement.
“Itochu has entered into these alliances with the aim of promoting and expanding the solar panel recycling business,” it said in a statement.
Rosi Solar develops technologies to recycle silver, copper and silicon from solar panels without crushing them.
“The processes used are based on physical, thermal, and soft chemistry mechanisms,” said the Grenoble-based company. “They do not use aggressive chemical reaction and the operating cost is reduced.”
Rosi Solar said it plans to start operating a commercial recycling plant in France from the beginning of 2023. It claims its technologies “allow to operate economically viable recycling sites for photovoltaic modules in Europe.”
Itochu, meanwhile, said it aims to develop and expand its solar panel recycling business in Japan and other countries.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/30/luminescent-solar-concentrators-for-applications-in-agrivoltaics-greenhouses/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,MOROCCO",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 30, 2022","Luminescent solar concentrators for agrivoltaics, greenhouses","Scientists at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in Morocco have proposed the use of luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) in greenhouses and agrivoltaic installations.
LSCs are commonly used as photonic devices in the production of fine chemicals in photomicroreactors, in dynamic “smart” windows to control light entering spaces, and for distribution of color-tuned light to enhance plant growth in greenhouses. They can also be used to improve the efficiency of solar panels. The LSCs consist of luminescent materials that are also known as luminophores, which are groups of molecules that emit light when illuminated.
The materials can be coated on the surface of a polymer or glass plate, or used as a dopant of the polymer or glass plate acting as a light guide. They can capture direct and indirect sunlight at one wavelength and re-emit it at a longer wavelength. If applied to PV, luminophores are able to capture high-energy photons that the photovoltaic panels cannot absorb and re-emit them as photons.
“Compared to conventional silicon solar cells, LSCc are more transparent, which means the necessary light for crops could be sufficiently diffused through them,” researcher Omar Moudam told pv magazine. “These devices are capable of converting ultraviolet (UV) light to visible light that could be used for crops and diffused light can be tuned for different colors such as red and blue that are favorable for plant growth.”
He said LSC devices can even produce electricity in low-light illumination. They are not heavy and are easy to for installation in greenhouses. LSCs can operate under full sunlight or shady conditions, and they don’t need to be oriented. They can be produced through simple manufacturing processes with cheap materials.
Moudam and his colleagues said current scientific research is looking into rare-earth complexes rather than common organic dyes for the development and fabrication of LSCs, as these compounds reportedly offer good photostability, high absorption coefficient, efficient quantum yield, and fewer reabsorption losses. LSCs can achieve values close to 300 nanometers in terms of Stokes shift, which is the spectral shift to lower energy between the incident light and the scattered or emitted light after interaction with a sample.
“Achieving a remarkable improvement in fluorescent quantum efficiency of rare-earth complex-based LSCs requires a deeper understanding of their molecular structures and an extended absorption up to the maximum wavelength of the visible spectrum,” the researcher said. “Highly efficient fluorophores with excellent absorption in the 430 nanometer to 780 nanometer range of the wavelength spectrum still need to be developed and improved.”
The research team presented its findings in “Recent progress in organic luminescent solar concentrators for agrivoltaics: Opportunities for rare-earth complexes,” which was recently published in Solar Energy.
In March, US solar panel manufacturer Heliene and US startup UbiQD signed a joint development agreement to make light-optimizing, energy-producing modules for agrivoltaic greenhouses. UbiQD has been developing electricity-generating windows alongside the photoluminescent light-optimizing UbiGro product.
Recent research from Eindhoven University of Technology provided a series of measurement protocols to assess the performance of luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) with the aim of helping this technology reach commercial maturity. The research shows that LSCs can be integrated with finished PV modules without the need to modify their electronic structure. If applied to PV, luminophores can capture high-energy photons that the solar panels cannot absorb and re-emit them as lower-energy photons.
More recently, a Dutch-Australian research team developed a luminescent solar concentrator device equipped with 20%-efficient bifacial silicon PV cells. It can be used and assembled in several mosaic configurations.

The group is working under the umbrella of the EU-funded Icarus project, which aims to develop modular processing solutions to recover 95% of high-value raw materials from silicon ingot and wafer production via fluidized bed (FBR) reactors based on the so-called Siemens process.
“It’s possible to recover this material as part of the production process,” said researcher Martin Bellmann. “And maybe this will enable us to establish a new solar-based industry in Europe.”
Bellmann described the discarded sawdust silicon powder as “black gold” and said that around 35% of the silicon in ingot and wafer manufacturing is lost after the sawing process. This powder can be stored in a liquid sludge mixture with contaminants from the sawing process such as oxygen, carbon, nickel, iron, and aluminum.
“Silicon contaminated by these metals is not good for solar panel manufacture,” Bellmann said, noting that the consortium is currently identifying ways to decontaminate the material. “A number of partners are testing different ways of separating silicon from the contaminated mixture.”
The consortium also wants to reuse the quartz crucibles that are used to smelt silicon for silicon carbide production.
“Normally, we use so-called high-purity quartz to make silicon carbide, but this is very expensive,” Bellmann said. “Our idea is that it might be possible to replace high-purity quartz with crucible waste, which is also in essence quartz of very high purity”
The consortium includes Norway's Northern Silicon AS, French PV recycling specialist Rosi Solar, Italy's Magneti Marelli Spa, and Germany's bifa Umweltinstitut GmbH.

“The ultra-thin size does not affect the performance of this battery, on the contrary, the battery module adopts the flexible printed circuits (FPC) process to maintain higher consistency of each cell, so the battery has a longer service life and higher efficiency,” CEO and President of Sales Eric Yi told pv magazine. “After repeated testing and inspection, this battery can have more than 6000 cycles at 100% depth of discharge, and the capacity retention rate can still stay at 80%. This exceeds most home battery brands in the industry.”
The Powerline battery measures 670 mm x 540 mm x 88 mm. With the mounting bracket on the back, it has an overall thickness of 90 mm. It weighs 50 kg.
The lithium-ion system has a storage capacity of 5 kWh and a nominal voltage of 51.2 V.  It uses LiFePO4 as the cathode material and has an ambient operating temperature range of -20 C to 65 C.
It comes with a 15-year warranty and can purportedly operate for more than 6,000 cycles. It also features an IP22 protection level.
“Considering that the average household device consumes about 3kWh of power per day, Bslbatt's PowerLine can theoretically reach a 20-year lifespan,” said Yi. “The battery is fully internalized in a vehicle-grade module structure using tier-one, A+ lithium iron phosphate cell composition, a premium module structure that provides better stability and heat dissipation, so it has a longer cycle life and does not have the toxicity or fire hazards of other lithium technologies.”

Meridian Energy has selected Australia-headquartered Woodside Energy as its preferred partner to deliver its proposed $3 billion Southern Green Hydrogen project on New Zealand’s southernmost tip. The decision comes after a list of 80 interested companies was whittled down to two.
Meridian also announced that its joint venture partner, Contact Energy, has pulled out of the project. The reason for the withdrawal was not given, with Meridian simply saying in a statement that Contact Energy had decided not to continue into the next phase of the project as a development partner, though it will remain a potential electricity supplier.
Meridian says Mitsui. & Co. – which boasts the largest share of ammonia imports into Japan – is also now in discussions to join the project.
The proposal now moves into the final investment decision stage. Then, subject to finalizing commercial arrangements, Meridian, Woodside, and Mitsui will work toward commencing front-end engineering design for the project.
Added benefit
First proposed in June 2021, the Southern Green Hydrogen project seeks to explore the opportunity of producing green hydrogen in Southland following the announcement that Rio Tinto would close its Tiwai Point aluminum smelter, primarily powered by a Meridian hydroelectric plant.
The vision is to build a 600 MW facility which would use the power from Meridian’s Manapouri hydro scheme to energize hydrogen electrolyzers, targeting an annual production of 500,000 tons of ammonia.
“We expect the facility will have the added benefit of being able to provide up to 40% of New Zealand’s dry year flexibility needs to the electricity sector,” says Meridian Energy CEO Neal Barclay.
Nonetheless, there are doubts about the potential demand for Asia-Pacific ammonia megaprojects as Europe and the United States usher in superior policy environments.
The next print edition of pv magazine – due out on Tuesday – will visit Ukraine to examine the extent of damage caused to the nation’s energy infrastructure, including its solar plants, and we will include coverage of how PV has been affected in the newly-liberated region of Kherson.
Winning the project is undoubtedly important for Woodside. The company is facing sharp and renewed criticism over its Scarborough gas project, a sustained source of protest for environmental group Greenpeace. Woodside is looking to stay relevant through its move into hydrogen, but is notably pursuing both blue hydrogen (made from fossil gas) as well as some green hydrogen through renewable energy sources such as hydro.
In June 2022, Woodside merged with BHP Petroleum, a deal that transformed the company into one of the world's largest gas and oil majors.

California’s Rondo Energy has released two versions of its Rondo Heat Battery (RHB), an energy storage system that dispatches heat and electricity for industrial applications. It is made of readily available materials such as bricks and iron.
The Bill Gates-backed company developed the battery as a way to decarbonize the industrial sector, which faces a range of challenges, including the need for large amounts of highly dispatchable power. The RHB systems can store more than 1 MWh per square meter, a high level of density that preserves area use at industrial facilities.
RHB batteries offer continuous power with a 95% annual capacity power while operating on input power as low as 15% capacity factor, or four hours of dispatchable power generation per day. The company’s so-called “brick toaster” heat battery stores intermittent generation from renewable energy resources like solar and wind, able to hold stored heat energy at temperatures up to 1,500 C for hours or days at a time. The zero-carbon solution supports manufacturing processes such as steel, cement and chemical manufacturing, as well as low-temperature food processing.
Rondo Energy said a single RHB300 unit could eliminate more than 40,000 tons of carbon emissions per year – equivalent to the carbon offset created by about 8,700 electric vehicles.
“The Rondo Heat Battery will help companies in industries such as cement, fuels, food and water desalination to begin leveraging the falling costs of renewables without modifying their facilities,” said Carmichael Roberts, the head of Breakthrough Energy Ventures’ investment committee.
RHBs use brick materials that have been used in the steel production process for over a century, but rearranged in a patented configuration. It can be used to replace fuel-fired furnaces and boilers, offering low-cost zero-carbon energy. The company said the units are fully automatic, able to deliver heat on demand for 24 hours a day at constant temperatures.
Rondo Energy said the batteries can be integrated into existing process heating equipment, allowing for significant emissions reductions without the need for a factory overhaul. The batteries are expected to operate for 40 years or more with no performance degradation.
“Rondo’s mission is simple: lower cost heat and energy for large industrial processes. We’re finding that deep emission reductions are now both practical and affordable for many of the world’s most energy-intensive facilities,” said Jeremey Keller, senior vice president of Rondo Energy. “Our studies of customer facilities are showing 50% to 90% reductions in emissions and reductions in operating costs of 30% or more.”
California-based Rondo Energy has raised $25.1 million in funding to date from Breakthrough and Energy Impact Partners. It concluded a Series A funding round in February.

The company claims the ready-made system can produce six to 10 times more electricity than standalone rooftop solar.
“PowerNEST accelerates the wind flow into the turbines increasing their output by 4 times, but also increases the power output of the solar panels by 30% to 40% by directing the wind to actively cool the panels from the bottom,” Ibis Power CEO Alexander Suma told pv magazine.
The modular solution includes a row of 3 kW wind turbines topped with bifacial panels that capture light reflections inside its white cladding. Each module measures 7.2 meters by 7.2 meters, with a height of 4.8 meters. The company has already installed the solution in five projects across the Netherlands, most recently in the HaasjeOver building in Eindhoven.
The HaasjeOver installation includes 10 PowerNEST modules. Overall, it has 240 bifacial, 396 W solar panels and 56 335 W monofacial panels, for an annual power output of 116 MWh. It includes four 3 kW wind turbines with annual outputs of 24 MWh, bringing the total solar and wind output to 140 MWh/year. This covers 85% of the tower’s energy needs, said Suma.
The PowerNEST is installed a few meters high from the rooftop, so it covers more rooftop space than is otherwise available.
“The roof before installation only had space for approximately 40 solar panels which needed to be fit in between the ventilation pipes, other utilities, roof edges, and their shadow,” Suma explained. “This would generate only 11 MWh/year to 12 MWh/year, which is 10 times less than with PowerNEST.”
The €800,000 ($827,570) HaasjeOver project was delivered as a turnkey solution.
“These are the actual cost of such a project if you want to make it structurally safe, use long-lasting materials and meet the building code,” said Suma.
He said that he expects costs to decrease as the company continues to expand. Ibis Power is currently developing 12 more PowerNEST projects in the Netherlands and is expanding into the rest of Europe and the United States.

In a recent report on PV in China, IEA-PVPS said that the country had a total installed capacity of 305.99 GW at the end of 2021. That means that China deployed around 58 GW of PV in the first 10 months of 2022. The NEA estimates that the country invested CNY 157.4 billion ($21.98 billion) in solar projects between January and October, up 326.7% year on year.
China could install between 80 GW to 100 GW of solar by the end of the year, according to the IEA-PVPS. Given that China added 5.6 GW of solar between September and October, according to NEA data, the country will have to ramp up installations until the end of the year to hit that level, however.
Last year, the distributed generation segment accounted for 53.4% of total new installed capacity, surpassing the 50% milestone for the first time, according to the IEA-PVPS. It expects this trend to continue into 2022.
The IEA-PVPS predicts China will add 80 GW to 100 GW of new solar capacity every year until 2025, according to its 2021-25 five-year plan. It says that China will add between 450 GW and 550 GW of new solar capacity from 2026 to 2030, and between 4,000 GW and 6,000 GW from 2030 to 2060.
