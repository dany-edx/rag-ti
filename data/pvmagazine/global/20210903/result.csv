The test was successful,” reads a statement released by NEDO last week. In August 2019, the partners started a demonstration test of a photocatalytic panel reaction system under natural sunlight outdoors and separated high-purity solar hydrogen from a mixed gas of hydrogen and oxygen generated by decomposing water. The results of the research were published last week in the online version of the scientific journal nature. “Extending our earlier demonstration of a 1 m2 panel reactor system based on a modified, aluminium-doped strontium titanate particulate photocatalyst, we here report safe operation of a 100 m2 array of panel reactors over several months with autonomous recovery of hydrogen from the moist gas product mixture using a commercial polyimide membrane,” the paper reads. “The system, optimized for safety and durability and remaining undamaged upon intentional ignition of recovered hydrogen, reaches a maximum STH of 0.76%.” The researchers said that hydrogen production is inefficient and energy negative overall, but that their findings demonstrate that safe, large-scale photocatalytic water splitting, gas collection and separation system are possible. “To make the technology economically viable and practically useful, essential next steps are reactor and process optimization to substantially reduce costs and improve solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency, photocatalyst stability and gas separation efficiency,” they further explained.
Novatek, Russia's second-largest natural gas producer, signed a Strategic Cooperation Agreement on low-carbon projects with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). “The Parties intend to cooperate on projects to produce hydrogen and ammonia, carbon capture, utilization, and storage technologies, as well as renewable energy projects in Russia, including ammonia and hydrogen production projects in the Yamal Peninsula,” reads a note released on Thursday. Founded in 1994, Novatek entered the global LNG market in 2017 with its Yamal project. “We are actively studying options to further reduce our current low carbon footprint from Novtaek’s LNG production by using renewable energy sources, carbon capture and storage and hydrogen-based fuels at our LNG projects,” noted Novatek Chairman Leonid Mikhelson during the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. “This Strategic Cooperation Agreement provides opportunities for us to work with Japanese companies and financial institutions on developing our low-carbon solutions, attracting investments and expanding the range of suppliers of state-of-the-art equipment and technologies.” The energy sector played a significant role at the Forum. Japanese Industry Minister Hiroshi Kajiyama also signed an agreement with Russian Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov to work together on hydrogen and ammonia production. “It is also hugely important that we make use of all the reserves that are available to us in this country,” Pavel Sorokin, Russia's deputy energy minister, commented on Thursday. Hydrogen is under the radar of the entire Russian energy sector.
Rusatom, a subsidiary of Russian state nuclear energy corporation Rosatom, is planning to launch its hydrogen cluster in the Sakhalin Region in the next years. “Our current plans include reaching a production volume of 30,000 tonnes of hydrogen per year by 2024,” said Anton Moskvin, Rusatom's overseas vice president for marketing and business development, during the forum, which aims to strengthen ties with China, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam.
The governor of the Brazilian state of Ceará, Camilo Santana, and the board of directors of EDP Brazil, a unit of Portuguese utility EDP,  announced a pilot project for a green hydrogen plant in the Port of Pecém, with a production capacity of 250 Nm3/h of gas. “Its operation should begin in December 2022, attracting a total investment of R$41.9 million,” reads a note released on Wednesday. According to the Ceará government, the project will be the first green hydrogen plant in the country. “Installed in the Pecém Industrial and Port Complex (CIPP), the plant will be the group's first, with 3 MW capacity and a state-of-the-art electrolyzer module for the production of fuel with guaranteed renewable origin,” said the government of the northeastern state located on the Atlantic coast. EDP CEO João Marques da Cruz added that the project was also aimed at the international market. The project will include research on the green hydrogen production chain and business models. For now, most of the projects announced in Brazil are scheduled to start operations in 2024/2025.
US construction machinery giant Caterpillar announced it would begin offering generator sets capable of operating on 100% hydrogen, including fully renewable green hydrogen, on a designed-to-order basis in late 2021. “More immediately, the company will launch commercially available power generation solutions that can be configured to operate on natural gas blended with up to 25% hydrogen,” reads the note released by the company on Wednesday. The world’s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment said that some of its gas turbine generator sets have run on high hydrogen blends for decades and are already capable of operating on 100% hydrogen.
U.S.-based zero-emission vehicle company Nikola and Germany-based industrial conglomerate Bosch Group have signed agreements for Nikola to utilize fuel-cell power modules using technology licensed from Bosch. The focus is on Nikola Class 7 and 8 fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEV). “Under the agreements, Bosch will supply both fully assembled fuel-cell power modules as well as major components to Nikola, including the fuel-cell stack, for Nikola to assemble at its manufacturing facility in Coolidge, Arizona. The parties will work together for sourcing of remaining components for the assemblies,” reads the note released on Thursday. The fuel-cell power modules are expected to launch in 2023, with the first application being the Class 8 regional-haul Nikola Tre FCEV. The vehicles are planned to utilize common fuel-cell power modules in 200 kW and 300 kW configurations. “The Nikola Tre FCEV will also be launched in the EU, utilizing the same fuel-cell power modules supporting vehicle manufacturing planned at Nikola’s joint venture with Iveco in Ulm, Germany.”
The German Aerospace Centre (DLR) teamed up with Cologne-based engine manufacturer Deutz to develop new hydrogen-based solutions for off-highway vehicles. The parties inked the deal for equipment and agricultural machinery production last week. “The aim is to speed up progress in making hydrogen drives viable for the off-highway segment and we will be combining our expertise and R&D capabilities to achieve this,” commented Markus Müller, Deutz’s chief technology officer.

A World Trade Organization dispute panel rejected all four of China’s claims against the U.S. relating to safeguard measures that the Trump administration imposed on solar panels imported from Chinese manufacturers.
In reporting the news, the Bloomberg news agency said that China failed to establish that Washington’s safeguards against imports of certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells were inconsistent with the WTO’s rules on the measures. The Geneva-based body issued its findings in a report.
Trump announced in early 2018 four years of import caps and tariffs on panels after a certain amount was imported. That was in response to a trade suit filed in April 2017 by a bankrupt U.S. solar manufacturer that claimed it had been harmed by low-cost imports, mostly from Asia. The U.S. International Trade Commission agreed in October that year, paving the way for Trump’s decision.

The plant, which the company describes as a full-scale demonstrator, will be co-located with an unspecified wind farm. “This project will bring the cost to €0.15 per kWh,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “In future projects, we expect to deliver clean energy everywhere in the world for less than €0.05 per kWh.”
The project is being developed under the umbrella of the EU-funded European SCalable Offshore Renewable Energy Sources (EU-SCORES), which also includes the deployment of a 1.2 MW wave energy array in Portugal that is co-located with a floating wind farm. “The full-scale demonstrations are intended to prove how the increased power output and capacity installed per square kilometer will reduce the amount of marine space needed, thereby leaving more space for aquaculture, fisheries, shipping routes and environmentally protected zones,” the company said in a statement.
“We have a shortlist of panels that we tested in the last two years at sea and that performed well. We will likely select one or more of these for the 3 MW offshore solar system,” the spokesperson went on to say.

Oceans of Energy unveiled in July details of the first 18 months of operation of its 50 kW off-shore pilot PV project in the North Sea. The 50 kW modular PV system started operating at the end of November 2019. The plant is planned to be initially expanded to 1 MW, and to 100 MW at a later stage. The installation relies on standard solar modules.
The company's CEO and founder, Allard Van Hoeken, told pv magazine in December 2019 that solar at sea could end up being cheaper than offshore wind once the technology was scaled up. He believes that offshore PV could help the Netherlands cover 50% of its energy demand, mainly by deploying solar close to existing or planned offshore wind projects.
According to a recent report from DNV GL, the North Sea may host around 100 MW of floating solar capacity by 2030, and 500 MW by 2035. The LCOE of offshore PV systems is currently estimated at around €354/MWh but in the future it should be close to that of ground-mounted solar parks.

Earlier research into the economics of manufacturing has shown that perovskite solar cells could benefit from the development of such devices, since they would allow for smaller-scale production, and for manufacturers to gain experience with the materials in an industrial setting, without the bigger investment needed for large-scale PV production.
Now, scientists led by the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland have found that perovskites can detect thermal neutrons, one of the hardest to detect particles emitted by radioactive materials. Working with methylammonium lead tri-bromide, the group found that neutrons hitting the perovskite produced a small current, and when combined with a foil of gadolinium metal and a carbon electrode, this could easily be measured.
The device is described in the paper Hybrid halide perovskite neutron detectors, published in Scientific Reports. The group was able to grow perovskite crystals around the foil, demonstrating another flexibility in perovskite material that could make it interesting for yet more applications. “The property of this material is such that it can engulf anything, from a fly to a crocodile, to gadolinium,” says EPFL chemist Márton Kollár. “So it grows around the object, and even when it grows around, it stays crystalline. So this is a really fabulous feature of this material.”
Having demonstrated the usefulness of perovskites in neutron detecting, the group says it will now work to optimize the devices, varying the thickness and form of the connector try and increase the signal to noise ratio. “It’s simple, it’s cheap, and it’s cost-effective,” says László Forró, who led the research. “Now that the team has shown that the device works, the next step is refinement and potential commercialization. This is a proof of principle, that it works. And now we can think about configuration for a very efficient detector.”

This phenomenon, which can cause capacity losses that can reach up to 50%, occurs during charging and recharging when battery electrolyte components cross the membrane in the battery cell and the redoxmers, which are redox-active molecules that can store energy in the batteries' electrolytes, migrate to the wrong side of the device.
Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin in the United States claim to have fabricated a non-aqueous hybrid redox flow battery that is crossover-free and, at the same time, provides high cell operation voltage and a low operating temperature.
The battery was built with a solid electrolyte membrane based on the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 natrium superionic conductor, also known as NASICON. It is able to circumvent the crossover of the liquids between the positive and negative electrodes and, simultaneously, to maintain single-ion conduction between the two electrodes to sustain the electrochemical reactions, according to the scientists. Membranes represent a significant portion of the final costs of RFBs. It is therefore important to identify the membrane technologies that could simultaneously ensure high performance and low-cost production.
The battery's solid sodium anode was paired with a liquid methylphenothiazine (MPT) cathode through a sodium-methylphenothiazine (Na-MPT) redox couple. “The redox reactions at positive and negative electrodes are ionically linked through the transport of sodium ions between the two electrodes,” the US group explained. “The dense structure of the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 membrane ensures a complete separation of the anode and cathode and circumvents the cross-mixing of the liquid species between the two electrode chambers.”
The battery performance was evaluated at ambient temperatures and, under a medium current density of 1 mA cm−2, the Na-MPT cells exhibited a high working voltage of around 2.6 V and a coulombic efficiency of 95.0%.
The battery was described in the paper “Accessing a high-voltage nonaqueous hybrid flow battery with a sodium-methylphenothiazine chemistry and a sodium-ion solid electrolyte,” published in Energy Storage.

Western Australia-based VSUN Energy has revealed plans to install three of Singaporean manufacturer V-Flow Tech's vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), as it looks to further develop the Australian market for battery storage technology.
VSUN, a subsidiary of Perth-based mining company Australian Vanadium Ltd. (AVL), has confirmed that the first three VRFBs supplied by V-Flow Tech will arrive in Fremantle later this month. VSUN said the vanadium electrolyte required for the 5 kW/30 kWh VRFBs has been sourced and will be installed when the batteries arrive in Australia.
The company said the three batteries will be paired with a 26 kW solar system at a caravan park in Western Australia’s wheat-belt region. Another will be deployed in an off-grid residential setting, where it will be paired with 12 kW of solar and 18 KVa of diesel back-up.
A third 5 kW/30 kWh VRFB, which will have a maximum discharge of 7 kW, will be used in a test project being developed by one of the state’s energy utilities, said VSUN.
VSUN said the test site will allow the company, external engineers and potential clients to observe a local working example of a VRFB, rather than examining installations and data from other countries. AVL Managing Director Vincent Algar added that this will provide further proof of concept and the learnings required to support decisions on energy storage technology options.
“VSUN Energy and AVL have developed a strong relationship with V-Flow Tech and we are excited to be receiving V-Flow’s first batteries in Australia,” he said. “The three installations will further increase our experience and provide valuable local operating examples of this Australian-invented storage technology.”
Lithium-ion batteries currently dominate the residential market, but VRFBs are gaining traction, with advocates declaring that they are safer, more scalable, longer-lasting, and more reliable.
VSUN, whose core objective is the growth of the market for VRFBs in Australia, said vanadium flow batteries do not degrade with cycling like lithium-ion options and are able to move electricity without generating heat. V-Flow has said its technology can operate between -10 C to 55 C without active cooling. The batteries have a lifespan of 25 years, with a stable performance guarantee.
The rollout of the batteries is the latest step for AVL, which was recently awarded a AUD 3.69 million ($2.7 million) federal government manufacturing grant. The funds will allow it to design, build and operate a AUD 7.4 million commercial vanadium battery electrolyte plant in Western Australia and develop VRFB prototypes for both off-grid and residential settings.
AVL plans to produce high-purity vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) from its mining operation south of Meekatharra, Western Australia, and its processing plant east of Geraldton to supply VRFB projects in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region.
“AVL’s manufacturing grant from the Australian government enables us to accelerate the construction of Australia’s first vanadium electrolyte plant, to provide the key supply element to this emerging industry,” Algar said. “The Australian Vanadium Project is at the forefront of this emerging market and driving its growth.”
AVL has also signed a memorandum of understanding with V-Flow for vanadium pentoxide offtake, vanadium electrolyte supply, VRFB sales, installation, service and maintenance. VSUN aims to collaborate with V-Flow to develop the capability to undertake most production of VRFB systems in Australia, with key elements such as the cell stacks being brought in from Singapore.
V-Flow , a spinoff from Nanyang Technology University in Singapore, has developed three products, including 20 kWh to 50 kWh batteries for residential settings, 100 kWh to 250 kWh units for commercial and industrial applications, as well as micro-grids for remote communities, and larger utility-scale deployments.

Our new solution integrates our smart string energy storage solution and is compatible with AC and DC coupling. It uses intelligent PV+storage collaborative control algorithms to realize synchronous characteristics to improve grid stability. The Smart PV Generator allows PV to no longer be a fluctuating resource, but instead to become a stable voltage source. It further integrates AI technology and couples with modules, trackers and the power grid, providing an end-to-end system covering multiple scenarios such as standalone PV, PV+storage, microgrid, and pure storage, to create a comprehensive and intelligent All-Scenario PV & Storage solution.
It has three major differences compared with traditional solutions. First, the world’s first “bipolar” string: the use of “Smart PV controller” and “Smart PCS” dual controllers, through the “±1500V” design on the DC side, to achieve the “3000V” architecture. While achieving higher voltage, it can also meet all existing standard requirements related to electrical and safety regulations for PV power plants, achieving a larger sub-array (up to 8.8 MW), support for larger current components, and higher DC to AC ratios (up to 1.8).
Second is the coexistence of PV and storage. The PV+storage coordinated control algorithm turns the PV system from an uncontrollable current source that cannot be stored into a stable voltage source, creating the PV generator. The new Huawei smart string energy storage system, distributed energy storage architecture, fully modular design, pack-level optimization, rack-level optimization, and other innovative technologies will ultimately achieve a levellized cost of storage (LCOS) reduction of more than 20%.
Third is full intelligence: A variety of advanced ICT technologies such as AI and cloud are catalyzed and organically integrated with PV. Modules, trackers, cables, array controller, energy storage, grids and inverters are fully coordinated and fully coupled, including the latest intelligent IV 4.0 diagnostic technology, DC MUBS, intelligent PID protection, SDS algorithm, intelligent grid-connecting algorithm, etc. The combination of these fully releases the potential of each string, creating a “zero inspection” O&M experience, and stronger grid support capabilities, so that power plants have three-dimensional awareness creating an open, efficient and intelligent PV+storage system.
Energy storage is an important foundation and key technology for building a new energy system with renewables as the main resource, in order to transition to a green and low-carbon energy system, achieving the goal of “carbon neutrality” and ensuring energy safety.
In the field of energy storage, Huawei has accumulated more than 10 years of R&D experience and the global deployment of 5 GWh+ in lithium battery projects. This time Huawei is bringing a full-scenario smart string energy storage solution.
In the traditional energy storage solution, modules are connected in series into a rack, and multiple racks are connected in parallel. Thousands or even tens of thousands of modules are coupled with each other. If one module fails, it will affect the others.
Our solution features battery pack-level and rack-level optimization. The solution can achieve more refined management, with an accuracy of no more than a dozen batteries, which is hundreds of times higher than the traditional solution. Besides, the refined management can achieve precise management of each pack with optimized depth of charge, which improves the available power of the system.
On the other hand, this innovative design can support the mixed use of new and old batteries and the phased charging mode, saving customers on their initial investment. Meanwhile, it is equipped with fully modular design, including power conditioning system (PCS), air conditioning and so on, much improved system availability, as well as simplified operations and maintenance. The modular air conditioner realizes a distributed temperature control layout, the temperature equalization effect is far superior to the traditional solution – the temperature difference is reduced by more than 10 °C, and the battery life is greatly improved.
Huawei attaches great importance to the safety of energy storage systems. Through the “pack-level and rack-level optimization and management” design, the system can achieve accurate management of battery packs, which can accurately isolate faulty modules and improve system safety. At the same time, as a leader in advanced technology in the ICT industry, through intelligent and digital technologies such as cloud, battery management systems and big data, faulty batteries can be accurately identified with red flags of fire hazards, and system-level and active safety can be ensured.
Huawei’s smart string energy storage solution increases the discharge capacity, reduces O&M costs, ensures safety and reliability, and achieves a 20% reduction in LCOS, helping to build a new energy system with renewables as the main source.
We believe that there will be three major trends in the future. First, we are progressing toward the fourth industrial revolution and accelerating our entry into the intelligent world. Second, carbon neutrality accelerates the energy transition. In the future, the world will build a clean, low-carbon, safe and efficient energy system. And third, renewable energy will become the main energy source. The integration of energy and information technology has become inevitable. In the future, new energy systems will move toward high transparency, two-way interaction, intelligent and efficient, plus comprehensive digital and intelligent technology.
Huawei has more than 30 years of deep understanding in the fields of digital technology and energy technology. The development direction of Huawei’s digital energy is to reduce emissions, accelerate the energy transformation, and realize a zero-carbon and smart society through technological innovation. For Huawei digital power, it would be one cloud plus four application scenarios and five root technologies, and all of that means an open ecosystem.
It integrates technology innovations such as electronic, thermal, energy storage, cloud and AI technology, and ICT technologies. We use “bits manage watts” by leading the digitalization of energy to build a zero-carbon intelligent society.
For our solar customers, we are aiming to build a full ecosystem, end-to-end energy solution. Not only in energy generation, but also in energy storage and consumption, further lowering the LCOE to enable increasing PV grid parity and PV+ storage grid parity. Through the integration of energy and information flow, an open energy cloud system, and an open technology ecosystem, we will enable renewable energy to become the main energy source.
Success is secured when people put their heads together. We hope to continue to innovate and create greater values for our customers to make technology benefit all.
This year we will bring a disruptive solution to the industry. We refer to this solution as the “Smart PV Generator,” to capture the wide range of smart photovoltaic generation applications covered by the solution. This includes large ground-mounted, C&I, and residential installations. It provides four major values: lower cost of electricity plus enhanced power grid plus comprehensive intelligence plus system-level safety.
Its main objective is to help the transition from PV to PV+storage, from traditional power generators to smart PV generators, turning the uncontrollable and non-stable current sources of PV to stable voltage sources. Instead of passively following the condition of the power grid, the Smart PV Generator actively enhances and supports the power grid, achieving a balance of energy supply and demand between randomly fluctuating load and power sources, and thereby building a new power system with renewables as the main source.
In terms of safety, Huawei has also created more innovations. Let me run through them. First is safe and reliable: in the scenario of large-scale, ground mount power plants, we pioneered intelligent string disconnection on the DC side to achieve active safety. The AC output adopts Huawei’s patented technology with zero arcing and high safety standards; the medium voltage side adopts a vacuum circuit breaker to ensure the end-to-end safety of the entire power plant. In the C&I and residential scenarios, we use key innovative technologies such as AFCI (arc fault circuit interrupter), fast voltage 0V shutdown, and AI internal short-circuit detection to achieve passive safety to active safety.
In addition, we are also introducing a full-scenario smart string energy storage solution. In traditional energy storage solutions, chemical differences in battery modules result in mismatches, causing problems such as reduced capacity, degradation, O&M cost, and safety issues, and it is difficult to support large-scale applications of energy storage.
Huawei deeply integrates its power electronics with energy storage technology and uses the controllability of power electronics to solve the inconsistency of lithium batteries. Pack-level optimization allows for independent charging and discharging of battery packs, while rack-level management avoids parallel mismatch between battery racks. Finally, the modular design of air conditioner and PCS ensures the system is efficient and reliable, creating smarter and safer string energy storage solutions with lower LCOS.

U.S. solar PV module shipments – including imports, exports, and domestic production and sales)  – rose by about one-third year on year between 2019 and 2020, according to new figures from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
The EIA reported a record high of 21.8 million peak kW shipped in 2020, which is a 5.4 million peak kW gain over the 2019 total. In 2020, 89% of U.S. solar panel shipments were imports, and total peak imported kilowatts rose by 26%. Vietnam was the leading exporter to the United States, followed by Malaysia, South Korea, and Thailand.

In August, a group of companies asked the U.S. Department of Commerce to impose antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on a handful of producers of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules that are imported from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention filed three petitions through the law firm Wiley Rein requesting that the commerce department investigate what it said were “unfairly traded imports” from the three countries.
In their petition, the U.S. companies complained that after AD/CVD duties were imposed on Chinese-origin solar cells, Chinese integrated producers started building cell and module assembly plants across Southeast Asia, while continuing “to rely heavily” on Chinese labor, raw materials, and inputs.
Capacity additions
The EIA said in its report that solar capacity additions rose 25% between 2019 and 2020, with utility-scale solar recording the largest gain at 29%. Small-scale solar projects of less than 1 MW rose by 19%.
Despite supply chain disruptions, which remain an ongoing issue, prices continued to fall. The average value of solar shipments, a useful proxy for prices, fell from $1.96 per peak watt in 2010 to $0.38 per peak watt in 2020, the EIA said.

One factor that drove growth despite pandemic-driven supply chain constraints was the scheduled reduction of the federal investment tax credit (ITC). In December 2020, Congress passed an extension of the ITC, providing a 26% tax credit for the 2020-22 year, and 22% in 2023.
Residential installation growth was also driven in part by an increase in home improvement projects, as consumers spent more time at home, said the EIA.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/03/restoration-of-full-customs-duties-for-inverters-hits-bangladeshi-solar-sector/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,BANGLADESH",SYFUL ISLAM,"SEPTEMBER 3, 2021",Restoration of full customs duties for inverters hits Bangladeshi solar sector,"The re-imposition of higher import duty and taxes on inverters has come as a burden to Bangladesh's slowly expanding renewables sector.
A special regulatory order which had applied a reduced, 11% import duty and tax cost on inverters was revoked in the 2021-22 budget which took effect in July, restoring the combined levy on the ‘important capital machinery' items to its previous 37%.
The Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association (BSREA) yesterday wrote to the government to appeal for the removal of the duties in their entirety if the nation is to achieve its aim of generating 40% of its electricity from renewables by 2041.
The “imposition of any additional duty and taxes will hinder attaining the target,” wrote BSREA president Dipal C Barua in a letter to the chairman of the nation's Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority.
The reimposition of duties also threatens Bangladesh's sustainable development goals and the greenhouse gas reductions the nation has committed to under the nationally determined contribution it set under the Paris climate agreement, Barua added.
Bangladesh is currently chairing the 48-nation Climate Vulnerable Forum group of countries disproportionately affected by global heating.
The trade body president suggested inverters intended for use in clean energy systems could have their own product code under the ‘harmonized system' used to classify items internationally, thus making it easier for governments to incentivize their use.
Imran Chowdhury, country head for inverter supplier Sungrow Renewable Energy Bangladesh Limited, said the restoration of full duties had come as a blow, especially with the Covid-19 pandemic continuing to affect the sector.
“The price of the item has already gone up, especially [for] rooftop solar, and other small initiatives will face hurdles,” he told pv magazine.
