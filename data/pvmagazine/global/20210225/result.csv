Portuguese power utility Energías de Portugal (EDP), whose largest shareholder is state-owned energy company China Three Gorges, has announced an unprecedented investment plan for the period 2021-2025.
The company will devote €24 billion to the plan, of which 80% will be invested in renewables, 15% in improving power grids, and 5% in solutions for customers and energy management.
EDP wants to double its installed capacity from clean energies in the next 5 years, from 12 GW currently to 25 GW in 2025, which means an average of 4 GW added per year.
The utility has also planned to stop producing coal power in 2025 and go fully green in 2030, anticipating its carbon neutrality targets in 20 years.
EDP will also invest € 2 billion in its digital transformation and new solutions for hydrogen, storage, smart grids, energy communities. and electric mobility.
The company had also announced recently the creation of H2BU, the new branch of the group for the development of green hydrogen projects, as well as a storage unit, EDPR NA, which will aim to reach a capacity of 1 GW of storage in five years.
At the end of December 2020, the utility's renewable energy arm, EDPR, had an installed renewable energy capacity of 2.4 GW, of which 1,648 MW of onshore wind energy, 404 MW of solar. Another 311 MW comes offshore wind projects.

The transaction is expected to be finalized in the second quarter of 2021.
“This acquisition is in line with Shell’s customer-first, digitally-enabled integrated power strategy that will help the company in its ambition to become a leading provider of clean Power-as-a-Service,” Shell said in a statement. “Shell aims to sell around 560-terawatt hours of electricity a year by 2030, twice as much as it sells today.”
Next Kraftwerke currently operates in Germany, Belgium, Austria, France, Poland, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Italy. Its units specialize in the trading of electricity from photovoltaics, bioenergy and hydropower on the wholesale electricity markets on behalf of their customers. “Bringing Shell and Next Kraftwerke together will help to accelerate the move towards a decarbonized energy system, through the wider deal opportunities and trading synergies that will come from the expected rapid increase in demand for renewable energy trading contracts,” said Next Kraftwerke CEO, Hendrik Sämisch.
Shell already operates in the VPP business through its unit Limejump. The company also made a strong move into the storage and VPP market by acquiring German manufacturer Sonnen last February.
The oil group invested $1-2 billion in renewable energy strategies in 2018 – 4-6% of its annual investment volume. More recently, Shell claims to have taken steps to green its chemical operations – and boost the installed PV capacity of the Netherlands – by developing a 27 MW solar project.

According to a document published on the municipality's website, the project is being proposed by the company S.C. West Power Investment Srl and is expected to be built on a surface of 1,079 hectares. Romanian newspaper Adevarul has revealed that a group of international investors is behind this company, without providing further details.
The solar plant will have a capacity of 700 MW and will require an investment of approximately €700 million.
The project is likely being conceived to take advantage of the recent introduction of more favorable rules for power purchase agreements. On the other hand, no direct or indirect incentives are currently being awarded to large-scale solar in the country.
The only utility-scale PV projects currently under development are those of Romania's Complexul Energetic Oltenia (CE Oltenia), which wants to deploy 310 MW at one of its coal power facilities. The company is now seeking consultants to conduct feasibility studies to build four facilities, which are part of its restructuring efforts and decarbonization plan. According to Romanian media sources, the four projects will span 595 hectares, and their capacities will range from 60 MW to 95 MW.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the country had installed about 1.38 GW of solar at the end of 2019. Most of this capacity comes from megawatt-scale PV plants built under the country's now-expired green certificates scheme. Green certificates were only granted to companies that connected their PV projects to the grid before Jan. 31, 2016.

The panel was developed with a special perovskite material that is also known as CsxFA1-xPb(I1-yBry)3).  The material has no methylammonium and includes multiple types of cations and a mix of halogens.
The manufacturing process, according to the researchers, is easy to scale up, as it combines a coating step carried out in air followed by a gas quenching conversion step to form the desired perovskite material.
The perovskite layer is formed at a low temperature of less than 100 Celsius degrees and is then integrated into the modules using laser ablation as a structuring process, thus minimizing inactive areas. The device's fill factor is over 93%. The time required for the deposition of the perovskite layer on an M2 wafer is estimated to be around 30 seconds, which is by far the fastest process for large-scale, high-volume production, according to the scientists.
The proposed manufacturing technique is also claimed to be compatible with the integration of perovskite into heterojunction silicon solar cells in tandem architecture. Enel Green Power, the renewables unit of Italian utility Enel, and CEA-INES announced in August an efficiency of 25.0% for a heterojunction solar cell with an active surface of 213 cm2, based on the M2 silicon wafer format.

Belgium crossed for the first time the 1 GW threshold in terms of new PV deployment last year, according to new figures released by the Belgian trade body Promotion des Energies Renouvelables (APERe).
In 2020, PV systems with a combined capacity of 1,010 MW were installed in the country, of which 800 MW in the Dutch-speaking macro-region of Flanders, 150 MW in the French-speaking region of Wallonia, and 50 MW in the Brussels Metropolitan Region.
For comparison, the newly installed PV capacity for 2019 and 2018 was 544 and 367 MW, respectively.
 

Flanders and the Brussels Metropolitan Region saw a significant increase in new installations this year, while Wallonia registered a considerable decrease. This slowdown can be explained in particular by a 60% drop in large installations of 250 to 750 kW and an 85% collapse in very large installations of over 750 kW.
In Flanders, there was a 45% increase in residential installations, following the effect of the announcement of the 15-year grace period granted to PV systems owners under net metering to avoid the installation of a smart meter. The grace period, however, was invalidated by a decision of the constitutional court in January.
Small installations not exceeding 10 kW in size represent 60 to 65% of the installed capacity in Belgium, while arrays ranging from 10 to 250 kWp represent 10%. Installations that are smaller than 10 kW or larger than 250 kW represent 2%, respectively.

CBD is a technique to produce films of solid inorganic, non-metallic materials on substrates by immersing the substrate in a precursor aqueous solution.
The US scientists added a special conductive layer of tin dioxide bonded between the conductive layer and the perovskite material. “If the conductive layer is directly attached to the perovskite itself, the electrons and their counterparts, called holes, simply recombine on the spot and no current flows,” they explained. If the perovskite and the conductive layer are separated by this intermediate layer, the latter lets the electrons through and prevents the recombination.
The special conductive layer was treated with a chemical bath at 90 degrees Celsius, which made the precursor chemicals slowly decompose to form the layer of tin dioxide in place. “The team realized that if we understood the decomposition mechanisms of these precursors, then we’d have a better understanding of how these films form,” the research group explained. “We were able to find the right window in which the electron transport layer with ideal properties can be synthesized.”
Their analysis showed that different mixtures of intermediate compounds form, depending on the acidity of the precursor solution, which enabled to produce more effective films. The positive effect of this special conductive layer was also combined with an improvement of the perovskite layer, which was achieved by adding special additives that do not alter the material’s bandgap.
The achieved conversion efficiency of the solar cell was thus far demonstrated in tiny lab-scale devices. “The kind of insights we provide in this paper, and some of the tricks we provide, could potentially be applied to the methods that people are now developing for large-scale, manufacturable perovskite cells, and therefore boost those efficiencies,” said research author Moungi Bawendi.
“What we’re demonstrating is that even with a single active layer, we can make efficiencies that threaten silicon, and hopefully within punching distance of gallium arsenide,” stated MIT scientist Jason Yoo. “And both of those technologies have been around for much longer than perovskites have.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/25/there-is-no-magic-to-get-to-e1-5-kg-for-green-hydrogen-in-2022/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 25, 2021",‘There is no magic to get to €1.5/kg for green hydrogen in 2022’,"pv magazine: Mr. Lepercq, your company, Soladvent, is part of the Hydeal consortium and you are its spokesperson. The consortium plans to deploy 95 GW of solar and 67 GW of hydrogen in southern Europe by 2030. How is this massive target achievable? Considering that the project will start in 2022, we are talking about around 10.5 GW of solar and 7.4 GW of hydrogen capacity per year. Should we consider this capacity as separate from the standard market development?
Thierry Lepercq: These numbers seem big, but they are not. They represent a mere 1% of European fossil fuel consumption. The global PV market is set to reach 200 GW this year according to some estimates and keeps expanding exponentially, so we are talking about a tiny fraction of this market. The capacity of solar power projects which have applied for grid connection in Spain alone is in excess of 220 GW, although the limitations of the power grid mean most of these projects will only materialize under the form of hydrogen, connected to the gas grid. It is true that the global electrolyzer manufacturing capacity is still quite small. But wait for the gigafactory announcements to be made in the next 12 months: people are going to be stunned!
You recently stated that the project may make a big jump between 2025 and 2026. What will happen exactly at this stage? Will lower PV panel prices also play a role?
PV is on an incredible race to ultra-competitiveness. The €10/MWh threshold is about to be crossed — and continuous technology and manufacturing progress guarantees that this race will not slow down for at least a decade. The jump of green hydrogen volumes and corresponding fall of costs we anticipate by 2025 are the result of two factors: the ramp-up of electrolyzer gigafactories, which will bring about massive capacity additions from 2024 onwards, and the deployment of thousands of kilometers of dedicated hydrogen transmission pipes and terawatt-hours of underground storage to match at that horizon.
The consortium aims to reach a green hydrogen price of approximately €1.5 kg by 2030. Recent studies have shown that a $2 kg target could be hardly achieved and, eventually, only in certain markets. Can you explain how this could be technically and economically achieved? Is the crossing of the €1.5 threshold unavoidable for making green hydrogen viable?
As a solar entrepreneur, I defied skeptics at Solairedirect, my former firm, with the best bid in a highly competitive auction in India in 2011, the first merchant solar park in Chile in 2013 and the first project below $20/MWh in Mexico in 2017. Industry watchers should know it by now: entrepreneurs and actual projects have always beaten “studies” and “experts”, which have systematically proved to be behind actual market forces. My company is aiming at €1.5/kg delivered, including transmission in storage, not in 2030 but in 2022, because that is what the market demands. Around €1/kg is the equivalent of delivered natural gas in Europe, plus a €0.5/kg carbon value, corresponding to €50/t of CO2. There is no magic to get there. You need three factors: large-scale sites of over 500 MW; high irradiation areas such as Spain, Portugal and Tunisia; and industrialized solar and electrolyzer EPC based on mature and scalable technologies, competitive long-term debt financing thanks to the de-risking of offtake and cash flows.
How much of the expected drop in price for green hydrogen will come from improvements in PV technology and how much from an improvement in electrolyzer technologies?
As seen in auctions in recent months in Spain, Portugal and the UAE with prices ranging from €11 to €14/MWh, solar PV has already reached the required cost level, but further progress will certainly help. We are not banking on disruptions in electrolyzer technology, as we stick to alkaline, the most mature and cost-efficient by far, but rather on incremental progress in energy efficiency through bigger stacks and effects of scale in procurement and manufacturing. We anticipate a fall of 60% of all-in electrolyzer costs, including EPC, to below €400/kW by 2025.
In order to reach these ambitious targets in terms of volumes and prices, what kind of scale do individual projects have to reach? Can we imagine gigawatt-sized solar plants linked to giant electrolyzer in southern Europe?
Yes indeed. The key to success is the joint location of large-scale solar and electrolyzers directly connected to the gas and soon hydrogen grid. Connection to the power grid should absolutely be avoided as it massively increases the overall costs without providing benefits. We are already working on sites south of the Mediterannean with individual capacities of more than 25 GW.
Spain has been chosen as the preferred region for the project. Are there plans to expand it to other countries such as Italy, Portugal or France? What kind of characteristics should an ideal location for big green hydrogen projects have? Is the presence of a close industrial demand for hydrogen necessary? Will the produced hydrogen also be shipped to markets outside Europe?
It is a resource play. If you look for oil, you should opt for the Permian basin rather than the Paris region, which does produce tiny volumes. When it comes to solar you want 2,000 kWh/kW and plenty of available land. Only two European countries meet these requirements: Spain and Portugal, and possibly some parts of South Italy. France is handicapped by a significantly lower resource and nightmarish permitting procedures. The availability of very cheap pipeline transport means you can have thousands of kilometers between production and usage. German industrial giants already know they are going to thrive with Spanish and Tunisian hydrogen from large, low-environmental impact sites. Europe as a whole will not export and it will remain a significant importer — just as is the case for oil and gas today.
You recently stated that the consortium will begin selling hydrogen in September 2022. What kind of prices and sales volumes can we expect for this time? How many of these first attempts will rely on existing gas infrastructure?
The market, always the market. We are targeting a €1.5/kg sales price from the first day, because this is what customers demand in the industry for chemicals, refining, steel, cement, the energy sector for power and heat, and mobility for shipping and trucking fuel. It is a binary commodity play. If you can reach market price, there is no limit to what you can sell. If you are above the market, nobody will buy from you. We will start injecting in the gas grid and market our product with guarantees of origin, and move to dedicated hydrogen pipes as soon as they are ready. We expect to cross the 20,000 t/y mark in early 2024 and ramp up to 500,000 t/y two years later.
Is the consortium hoping that favorable regulatory frameworks and some sort of incentives will be given to hydrogen? What kind of conditions should be created by policymakers to make projects like HyDeal succeed?
The hydrogen industry is a zero-carbon copycat of the oil industry. Upstream, midstream and downstream is the way to go. We are highly confident that both ends of the value chain can take care of themselves. The key issue is the midstream, this means transmission and storage. We need governments and regulators to implement proper regulatory frameworks to allow investment decisions in repurposing and expanding existing pipes and underground caverns to be made ASAP. Seeing how this issue is seriously taken up by the European Commission, certain governments, especially the German one, and gas transmission operators across Europe, I am quite optimistic!

French independent power producer Neoen has reached financial close on its Victorian Big Battery (VBB) after the Australian Government-owned Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) provided a senior debt facility to finance the design, construction and operation of the battery, which will be one of the largest energy storage facilities in the world.
“We are delighted to announce that the Victorian Big Battery has reached this important financial milestone,” Neoen Australia managing director Louis de Sambucy said in a statement on Thursday. “I would like to thank the CEFC for their renewed trust and commitment towards supporting innovative storage solutions. We are on track to deliver this project before the next Australian summer and are looking forward to playing our part in helping Victoria reach its ambitious target of 50% renewable energy by 2030.”
Financing of the VBB was completed just three months after Neoen secured a grid services contract with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).
The System Integrity Protection Scheme (SIPS) contract will run until 2032, unlocking up to 250 MW of additional peak capacity on the existing Victoria to New South Wales Interconnector (VNI) over the next decade.  Under the contract, the battery will provide an automatic response in the event of an unexpected network outage, providing AEMO with an additional resource to ensure grid stability.
CEFC chief executive Ian Learmonth said the VBB, to be built next to Moorabool Terminal Station in Geelong, would provide a critical boost to the state’s grid security and support a higher penetration of renewable energy.
“The battery will provide grid support services when it is under pressure, allowing authorities to increase the capacity of the VNI by up to 250 MW,” he said. “With more power flowing between the states, including during the peak summer season, the battery will contribute to grid reliability and security.”
To be entirely owned and operated by Neoen, the project will be delivered in collaboration with Tesla, using its Megapack technology, and network partner AusNet Services.
The VBB is among a suite of projects being pursued in Australia by Neoen which earlier this month announced its interests here had helped deliver an 18% increase in revenue for 2020.
Among the company’s 2020 highlights was the signing of a power purchase agreement (PPA)  with CleanCo Queensland for 110 MW of wind energy which will allow for the construction of the 157 MW Kaban wind farm near Cairns, in Queensland.
That followed reaching financial close on the 460 MW Western Downs Green Power Hub as well as securing a 14-year contract with the Australian Capital Territory. Neoen has also filed planning documents for a 500 MW / 1000 MWh big battery to be built west of Sydney and continues to operate the recently expanded 150 MW Hornsdale Big Battery in South Australia.
“We are thrilled to be building our second big battery in Australia. The Victorian Big Battery once again demonstrates the value of innovative solutions that Neoen is proud to be pioneering,” Neoen chairman and CEO Xavier Barbaro said. “At 300 MW, it will be one of the largest batteries in the world, taking our total capacity in operation or under construction in Australia to over 1.8 GW, and bringing us one step closer to our global target of 5 GW by the end of 2021.”
Victoria’s Minister for Energy Lily D’Ambrosio said the VBB will contribute to the dispatchable resources needed to underpin the increasing share of renewable energy that will make up Australia’s future energy mix. “The Victorian Big Battery is an important part of the largest modernization of the grid in our state’s history, ” she said. “It will create jobs and drive down energy prices, while supporting our transition to renewable energy.”
Energy storage is rated a priority technology under the Australian Federal Government’s Technology Investment Roadmap, as an enabler of cost-effective and reliable low emission electricity.
The AEMO Integrated System Plan indicates distributed energy will provide as much as 22% of the nation’s underlying annual energy consumption by 2040, with more than 26 GW of additional renewable energy required to replace coal-fired generation. This will require up to an additional 19 GW of new dispatchable resources, including utility-scale battery storage.

Three grid-enhancing technologies can boost the utilization of any existing transmission system, according to a study by The Brattle Group.
In Kansas and Oklahoma alone, those technologies could make room for 40 MW more solar and 2.6 GW more wind power by 2025.
The grid-enhancing technologies considered by the report are advanced power flow control, topology optimization, and dynamic line ratings. The technologies are offered by member firms of the WATT Coalition, which provided input to the Brattle study.
As part of its work, Brattle conducted a power flow analysis to determine the wind and solar capacity that could be added in Kansas and Oklahoma, first without the three technologies, and then with them.
Considering the 260 MW of solar projects in those states that have signed interconnection agreements, the grid could accommodate 140 MW of solar by 2025 with the new technologies, versus 100 MW without them. That represents a 40% improvement for solar.
Of the 9.17 GW of wind projects in the two states that also have a signed agreement, the grid could accommodate 5.1 GW with the transmission technologies, or about twice as much as the 2.5 GW possible without them.
Looking just at a scenario with the transmission technologies implemented, the two states could accommodate 54% of the solar projects and 56% of the wind projects with signed interconnection agreements, according to the study’s lead author Bruce Tsuchida.
To describe advanced power flow control, the WATT Coalition first explained that power flow control refers to a set of technologies that redirect power away from overloaded lines and onto underutilized parts of a transmission network. Advanced power flow control accomplishes that task but with hardware having advanced features such as the ability to be quickly deployed, easily scaled, or redeployed as needed.
Topology optimization achieves the same outcome as advanced flow control devices, said the Brattle study, but does so using existing equipment. The optimization technique uses software to identify which transmission line circuit breakers should be switched open or closed to route power flow around congested elements. In this way, said Brattle, it’s like “Waze for the transmission grid.”
The U.S. Department of Energy describes dynamic line ratings by first noting that the maximum power flow capacity on a transmission line is limited by heating considerations. So-called static line ratings are calculated using generally conservative assumptions about the transmission line's operating environment, but without considering factors such as wind cooling that allow for greater transmission utilization. Dynamic line rating determines transmission line thermal ratings using improved or real-time data, to help system operators determine the prevailing current-carrying capacity limits of transmission lines.
Brattle prepared the study, “Unlocking the Queue with Grid-Enhancing Technologies,” with input from the WATT Coalition and funding from GridLab, EDF Renewables North America, NextEra Energy Resources, and Duke Energy Renewables.
