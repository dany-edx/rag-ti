It has previously installed the fuel cell in several pilot projects in Japan.
Dubbed H2 Kibou, the fuel cell system works with pure hydrogen at a density of more than 99.97%, and achieves electrical efficiency of 56%. “The higher electrical efficiency leads to the reduction in hydrogen use, therefore contributing to the reduction of total running cost,” the manufacturer said in a statement.

The company also explained that, using a simple PC application, it is possible to bundle together up to ten units for a total capacity of 50 kW, and that these units can be further combined to create a MW-sized installation.  “By connecting a hot water storage unit (recommended product) with the product, heat generated from the fuel cell can be converted into hot water for use,” it also emphasized. “The generator has achieved total energy efficiency of 95% including the heat recovery, thereby allowing the effective use of energy without waste.”
The new product can be used with an operating temperature between -10 and 40 degrees Celsius, at altitudes not exceeding 500 m. During power outages, it is able to generate electricity and to use up to 2.5 kW of its capacity for at least 120 hours. “The product can be started in approximately one minute, which is useful for responding to peak cut control when a quick response from generators is required,” Panasonic highlighted.
The device was used by the Japanese conglomerate in a pilot hydrogen plant combined with photovoltaics and storage it built at its fuel cell factory in Kusatsu, Shiga Prefecture, in central Japan.
“Through this demonstration, Panasonic will accumulate know-how and establish a track record in energy management, including the operation of pure hydrogen fuel cell generators, and aim to commercialize the RE100 solution, which uses power generated in-house from renewable sources to supply 100% of the electricity required for business activities,” the company said at the time.

Having announced, in May, it had uncovered the fact the disputed stock had been transferred out of the account of an unnamed depository broker in June last year, GCL today said the investigation firm it employed to look into the matter had found: “One of the key individuals associated with the lender has previously been accused of fraudulent conduct and been involved in other financial disputes. The alleged fraudulent conduct and disputes have involved other companies controlled by this individual, which signed master loan agreements with borrowers, but which, after taking in shares as collateral, allegedly failed to deliver the full loan amount [and] instead, purportedly, sold the collateralized shares in the market.”
The October edition of pv magazine which is due to hit the streets tomorrow includes an in-depth look at the fire hazard concern of lithium-ion battery systems, with a focus on the blaze at Australia’s Victorian Big Battery which caught the world’s attention. Also, Saul Griffith, the guru of electrification, talks to pv magazine about reshaping the climate conversation; we delve into the evolution of residential PV in China; and we continue our coverage of global PV supply-chain issues and ask: Is there an alternative to Made in China?
That appears to have been what happened to GCL, which has accepted the fact it has lost a big chunk of its holding in its GCL New Energy project business. pv magazine reported in May that without the missing shares, GCL controlled only 49.24% of the solar development operation.
As revealed by GCL earlier this year, its Elite Time Global Ltd subsidiary had, on August 28, 2019, pledged the shares as security for a $60 million loan from a lender which was today named as Bentley Rothschild Capital 5 Ltd. The lender reportedly confirmed, on September 26, 2019, it would supply three payments of $16 million plus a final sum of $12 million.
GCL said in May, only $2.2 million of the promised funds materialized, in February 2020, and the company discovered five months ago the shares, which had been transferred to the depository broker, had been transferred to the lender 11 months earlier, after Bentley Rothschild claimed the terms of the loan agreement had been breached.
GCL is yet to explain how the transfer of the stock went unnoticed for almost a year but today said investigative firm FTI Consulting (Hong Kong) Ltd could find no business history or physical office for Bentley Rothschild Capital 5 other than the address of the company secretary, in the Caribbean island nation of St Kitts and Nevis.
The polysilicon manufacturer today told the Hong Kong Stock Exchange it considers itself to remain controlling shareholder of the New Energy business and had decided not to pursue the matter further because of the potential costs involved and “the likelihood of receiving a meaningful recovery.” As previously reported by pv magazine, at the time of the loan arrangement the 865 million shares pledged by GCL were said to be worth $120 million.
Trading in GCL stock has been suspended since the end of March because of the company's inability to publish its full year accounts for 2020 after the previous auditor, Deloitte, walked away from the business over the issue of a RMB510 million ($79 million) pre-payment made in September 2019 to a state-owned entity, for a production facility which never took shape.

Austrian manufacturer M-Tec Energy Systems GmbH will launch a modular battery storage system with an integrated hybrid inverter in January 2022.
Dubbed Energy Butler, the storage system consists of a modular battery that can be stacked by combining up to eight modules to reach a storage capacity ranging from 11.5 to 30.7 kWh.
The company said the new product is suitable for both single and multi-family houses as well as for commercial buildings, for which it can be cascaded to a capacity of up to 300 kWh.
According to M-Tec, the storage system can be installed quickly and easily, with the integrated hybrid inverter saving time during assembly and also space in the technical room. The device also relies on network-independent emergency power back-up, which supplies energy even in the event of a power failure.
In addition, an embedded E-Smart energy management system, which M-Tec has developed especially for its overall energy solutions, is responsible for monitoring and controlling, as well as for maximizing solar self-consumption. The manufacturer optionally delivers the system pre-configured with other E-Smart components.
M-Tec guarantees 10,000 charging cycles over a 10-year period. “Together with our ‘E-Smart' energy management system, a total energy solution consisting of photovoltaics, battery storage, heat pumps, controllable electric heating elements and charging stations for e-mobility is created,” explained M-Tec managing director Peter Huemer.
Depending on the configuration and size, the costs are slightly below those of the comparable competitors, a spokesman for M-Tec told pv magazine. The company will use its existing sales channels with electrical and heating installers to sell its storage system.

Adani Green Energy Ltd, the world’s largest solar power developer, today announced it had completed the acquisition of SB Energy Holdings Ltd for an enterprise valuation of $3.5 billion (INR26,000 crore). The transaction marks India's largest renewable energy acquisition.
SB Energy – formerly an 80:20 joint venture majority owned by Japan's SoftBank Group, alongside New Delhi-headquartered conglomerate Bharti Group – has become a wholly-owned Adani subsidiary.
Pick up your copy of the September edition of pv magazine today for a detailed update on solar and battery storage in the United States, which faces a tough decision between taking advantage of Asian imports, or developing domestic manufacturing at the risk of slowing progress towards decarbonization.
The target company, through its special purpose vehicles, has 5 GW of solar and wind energy assets across 15 projects in four Indian states. The renewables plants, with an average generation capacity of 330 MW, have 100% sovereign-rated counter-parties to purchase their energy and sell electricity for an average tariff of INR2.75 per kilowatt-hour.
The acquisition boosts Adani’s operational portfolio to 5.4 GW, and its total clean power development pipeline to 19.8 GW, including 5.4 GW of operational assets, 5.7 GW under construction, and 8.7 GW nearing construction. Adani’s counter-party mix for its overall, 19.8 GW portfolio is features 87% sovereign-rated counter-parties.
The SB Energy 5 GW portfolio includes 1.7 GW of operational project capacity, 2,554 MW under construction, and 700 MW nearing construction. Solar capacity accounts for 84% of the estate – some 4,180 MW; wind-solar hybrid capacity supplies 9% (450 MW), and wind capacity 7% (324 MW).
“This is one of India’s highest-quality renewable portfolios, with many of the assets being solar park-based projects and constructed using best-in-class governance, project development, construction and operations and maintenance standards,” said Adani.
The transaction followed Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani’s announcement last week of plans to invest more than $20 billion in renewable energy generation over the next decade.
“This transaction takes us closer to becoming the global leader in renewables,” said Adani managing director and CEO Vneet S Jaain. “The addition of these high-quality, large, utility scale assets from SB Energy India demonstrates Adani Green Energy’s intent to accelerate India’s efforts to transition towards a carbon-neutral future. Our renewable energy foundations will enable an entire ecosystem of new industries that can be expected to catalyze job creation in multiple sectors.”

The EU executive is planning to potentially introduce regulation requiring solar modules, inverters “and systems” to be designed so as to be more easy to repair and recycle, and to include energy labeling to aid consumer choice, with an adoption date envisaged in around a year's time.
Circular manufacturing was a focus of the UP Initiative a year ago. We looked at whether adopting circular approaches can create a competitive edge and reap financial and reputational rewards, in addition to investigating what is already being done in the solar industry. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
The process has kicked off with a four-week ‘feedback' period which will run until October 28 and be followed by an official consultation period penciled in for the first quarter of next year.
The paperwork published by the commission mentioned the fact regulators are considering applying carbon footprint requirements on goods manufactured and traded in the EU as part of the commission's updated industrial strategy.
The background papers do not commit to any content of the potential new legislation but a section of the ‘inception impact assessment' document – which explains the process for carrying out an impact assessment of any new rules – entitled ‘problem the initiative aims to tackle' stated: “The manufacturing and shipment of photovoltaic modules account, together, for a significant share of the carbon emissions of these products, with improvement potentials that could be attained by means of design choices.”
The papers also touched on the possibility of raising the energy efficiency of EU solar equipment by removing “products off the market that are of a low quality.”
And under the header ‘likely economic impacts,' the document suggested the possibility of “decreasing the environmental impact, while keeping a high quality process, of the manufacturing phase” of solar products.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/04/stormy-skies-ahead-for-spanish-electricity-sector/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,SPAIN",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"OCTOBER 4, 2021",Stormy skies ahead for Spanish electricity sector,"From pv magazine Spain
Hardly a day passes without Spanish energy company Iberdrola announcing the development, completion, or purchase of a new renewable project somewhere in the world. However, this may soon stop occurring in the company's home market, as numerous national media outlets have reported that the multinational utility has decided to stop bidding for goods and services associated with the construction of new renewable projects in Spain.
Iberdrola said this to suppliers involved in bidding processes for renewables in Spain. The situation will continue until the economic viability of these projects is evaluated in detail, after the application of Royal Decree‑Law 17/2021 on urgent measures to mitigate the escalation of energy prices, which was introduced on Sept. 14. The new provisions reduce the revenues of non‑emitting plants and establish that the excess remuneration will be determined on a monthly basis from the average price of gas in the Iberian market.
Iberdrola has not provided comment to pv magazine on the halting of the bidding process. But it has not only announced the suspension of investments in new renewables projects. Together with Enel's Endesa unit, it plans to renegotiate long-term supply contracts with large clients, as new provisions introduced by Royal Decree‑Law 17/2021 make these deals unviable. Meanwhile, the price of electricity has reached a new record at €216 ($250)/MWh, the highest in the European Union, and above €200 for the first time.
Global electricity and gas prices are skyrocketing and the tipping point of this unprecedented trend is not yet in sight. This situation is putting the entire global economy under severe pressure and could also cause financial problems for many energy-intensive companies in the short term.
The governments of Spain and France have asked the European Commission to modify the operating rules of the union's wholesale electricity markets to stop the price escalation, as prices are now at record highs in all countries. However, European regulators do not look favorably on market reforms.
Frans Timmermans, vice president of the European Commission for climate change, told a group of Spanish journalists in Strasbourg that “the redesign of the market” can be “discussed, but not with a quick decision … I will do everything in my power to help the Spanish government to ensure that Spanish citizens are not unduly affected by market fluctuations, because what is happening is just that, fluctuations.”
The Electrification Alliance, a group of associations supporting the electrification of the European Union's energy system, addressed a letter to the European Commission in September in which it offers “answers and recommendations” in the face of the “worrying situation that Europe is experiencing due to the increase in wholesale electricity prices.”
To overcome this situation, the Alliance for Electrification recommends structurally reducing taxes on electricity bills, fully applying the provisions of the Clean Energy Package to ensure flexible consumption for all and accelerate the clean energy transition to protect citizens and enterprises from volatility in fossil fuel prices. “Europe must reduce its dependence on imported gas and its exposure to volatility in world gas prices,” the letter reads. “The EU Green Deal and climate neutral ambition clearly point in this direction.”
Iberdrola, Endesa, EDP Spain, Aelec, Eurelectric, Wind Europe, Solar Power Europe and Portuguese electricity association Elecpor have decided to raise their complaints with the vice-presidents of the European Commission, Frans Timmermans and Margrethe Vestager. They have also contacted Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson in a protest letter supported by the Global Infrastructure Investors Association (GIIA), a global network of advisory firms, banks, law firms and investment funds that includes KKR, Oaktree, Antin, Infracapital, Ardian, JPMorgan, OPTrust, Aimco, Allianz, Brookfield, UBS, PwC, Morgan Stanley, EY, Deloitte. They have called for the measures introduced by Royal Decree‑Law 17/2021 to be reversed.
The letter, which pv magazine has seen, affirms that the government's measures do not take into account that 100% of baseload production, including hydroelectric, nuclear and renewables for 2021 and more than 75% of it of 2022 has already been sold by generators for months at the forward prices then in force, which are much lower than the current spot market prices.
They claimed that this “will jeopardize the objectives of the Green Deal and Fit for 55 package, break the confidence and rights of investors and have a huge impact on the necessary investment in renewable energy.” RDL 17/2021 will also undermine the functioning of the EU's internal market, and “could spread to the other member states, creating fractures in the internal energy market and in European energy policy … We fully support the need to protect vulnerable citizens from spikes in energy prices and we strongly believe that the European regulation provides the framework for a range of different and legal solutions, as other member states have shown … (RDL 17/2021) creates massive distortions, uncertainty and damage.”
Iberdrola has since published statements by Ignacio Galán, its CEO, in which he states that “it is essential to preserve legal stability and the rules of the game, not to question the European model and not lose confidence investors.”
The credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s (S&P) published a report this past week in which it attributes the measures of RDL 17/2021 to “political motivations.”
Although the actions of the government will mean savings of 22% on electricity bills for households, according to S&P, gas prices will not be regulated until 2023. It also said the design of the regulated bill is “unconventional,” because “price hikes in the market are immediately transferred to household bills.”
According to their calculations, the reduction in gas will reduce Iberdrola's Ebitda by 12% (€1.2 billion), Endesa's by 22% (€900 million), and Naturgy‘s by 7% (€280 million) and 2% that of EDP (80 million). The total is €2.6 billion. In addition to calculating the decrease in income for energy companies at €3.20, they warn that the measures adopted by the government could have consequences on investment.
“We believe that the regulatory uncertainty derived from the Government's measures could lead companies to review their investments in Spain,” they stated, noting that, in the long term, the energy reform “could undermine investor confidence and capital allocation, which are critical to the success of Spain's ambitious national energy and climate plan.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/04/new-discovery-could-make-organic-pv-competitive-with-crystalline-silicon/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 4, 2021",New discovery could make organic PV competitive with crystalline silicon,"An international research team led by the University of Cambridge, in the United Kingdom, claims to have prevented charge recombination under open-circuit conditions in organic solar cells based on non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), which are the most powerful organic PV devices ever developed to date, with efficiencies exceeding 18% in some cases.
Non-radiative charge recombination is a major loss process in most organic solar cells based on NFAs, that occurs when a hole and electron that originate from the same photon recombine before separating into free charges. “As there is a stronger attraction between the electron and hole in carbon-based materials than in silicon, organic solar cells are more prone to recombination, which in turn affects their efficiency,” the scientists explained. “This necessitates the use of two components to stop the electron and hole from recombining rapidly: An electron ‘donor’ material and an electron ‘acceptor’ material.”
The academics claim that, through spectroscopy and computer modelling, they were able to see how the majority of charge recombination under open-circuit conditions proceeded via the formation of non-emissive NFA triplet excitons, which are quasi-particles that carry energy but no charge. In order to prevent recombination into triplet excitons from occurring, they engineered strong molecular interactions between the electron donor and electron acceptor materials, which made it possible to keep the electron and hole further apart.
“Modelling suggests that the rate of back charge transfer from spin-triplet charge-transfer excitons to molecular triplet excitons may be reduced by an order of magnitude, enabling re-dissociation of the spin-triplet charge-transfer exciton,” the researchers stated, referring to the molecular tuning of the donor and acceptor materials. “The fact that we can use the interactions between components in a solar cell to turn off the triplet exciton loss pathway was really surprising,” added researcher Alexander Gillett. “Our method shows how you can manipulate molecules to stop recombination from happening.”
The group said its research showed a pathway to develop new materials which block recombination into triplet excitons and have the potential to make organic solar cells achieve efficiency of over 20%, thus approaching those of non-organic PV.
The findings of the research can be found in the paper The role of charge recombination to triplet excitons in organic solar cells, which was recently published in nature. The research team also comprises scientists from Oxford University, the Université de Mons, in Belgium, the University of California, Santa Barbara, in the U.S., and Linköping University, in Sweden.

The system can be deployed by the users themselves, without the need for trained installers. Thanks to ‘plug-and-play' connections, installation can be carried out intuitively and in just a few simple steps, according to the manufacturer. “The solar modules can be connected to the boiler via MC4 contact plugs,” the company's CEO, Manuel Masenko, told pv magazine. “And the heating process begins immediately.”
The system is said to be cost-competitive as neither an inverter nor a battery is required.
The company offers its photovoltaic boiler in three different models – with capacities of 10, 30, and 80 liters. The maximum heating output is 550 W and the weight of the boiler ranges from 7.2 to 25kg. Its cost is between €350 and €499, depending on the size.
The solar modules are not included in the price as sales of the photovoltaic boiler are mainly in the B2B area, where customers can purchase their own photovoltaic equipment. “However, the solution can also be obtained by private individuals, via the Fothermo online shop, whereby the solar modules must be purchased separately if there is no photovoltaic system in the house,” Masenko further explained.
Fothermo specifies the required photovoltaic power for hot water for the smallest boiler variant is between 100 to 200 W; 300 to 450 W for the middle-sized device; and 800 to 1,000 W for the largest boiler. The maximum input voltage is 42.4 V with a current consumption of up to 15.5 A. The solution is equipped with MPP tracking. Depending on the size of the boiler, a power supply unit with 12 volts (PSU-12) or 18 volts (PSU-18) is recommended as a power supply unit.

In Yunnan province, in southwest China, producers of the silicon metal which feeds polysilicon have been operating at 10% of the output they achieved in August and will continue to do so for the rest of the year as provincial authorities try to control electricity demand with a measure that is also affecting the phosphorus industry.
Fellow solar supply chain members from the aluminum industry in Guangxi province, in the south, have been forced to operate just two days per week, alongside peers in the concrete, steel, lime, and ceramics segments, and manufacturers in neighboring Guangdong have access to normal power supplies only on Fridays and Saturdays with electricity rationed to a 15% grid security load for the rest of the time.
As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we have focused on raw material sourcing for the energy storage industry. Read about the overall supply chain for batteries, lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
With reports of drastic power shortages emerging from China in recent days, the country has actually been experiencing problems since late June but rationing is not unusual during the peak summer hours.
What has changed this time is that the outages have continued and prompted rationing measures across 19 of the nation's provinces for the rest of the year, and it is not just manufacturers who are being powered down. In China's northernmost province of Heilongjiang, which is starting to experience cold temperatures, a family was reportedly almost killed after an unannounced blackout halted a fan in their village home which was responsible for dispersing carbon monoxide fumes from their heating system.
The problems have been caused by a combination of rising post-Covid electricity demand at a time when the politically-motivated ban on imports of Australian coal has tightened supply; and the manner in which Beijing controls power prices, with the situation further exacerbated by carbon emissions reduction policy.
Electricity demand from industry was 13.5 percentage points higher in the first eight months of the year than in the same period of 2020, at 3,585 TWh, reflecting a 13.8% year-on-year rise in total consumption, to 5.47 PWh, according to data from state energy industry trade body the China Electricity Council. Figures produced by the China General Administration of Customs tell the same story of a rebound driven by the global recovery from the pandemic, with China recording import and export trade worth RMB2.48 trillion ($385 billion) in January-to-August, up 23.7% on the same period of last year and 22.8% higher than in the first eight months of 2019.
With Beijing having enforced an unofficial ban on imports of Australian coal for the last year or so – as the result of an ongoing diplomatic spat with Canberra – that rising demand for the fuel which provided around 73% of Chinese electricity in the first half of the year, has further raised prices for the fossil fuel.
The problem for Chinese coal-fired power generators is that Beijing maintains strict controls on the price of electricity so input costs cannot be passed on to the consumer. The mismatch between a liberalized coal market and centrally-controlled end-user prices is illustrated by the current situation in Guangdong, where a coal price of RMB1,560 per ton ($242) has pushed the cost of coal-fired electricity up to RMB0.472 per kilowatt-hour ($0.073). With coal power companies facing an electricity price ceiling of around RMB0.463/kWh ($0.071), generators are losing around RMB0.12 for every kilowatt-hour they generate. In that situation, rationing electricity supplies is an obvious remedy.
The crisis has been worsened by the introduction of China's ‘dual control' energy policy, which aims to help meet president Xi Jinping's climate change pledge of hitting peak carbon emissions this decade and a net zero economy by 2060. ‘Dual control' refers to attempts to wind down greenhouse gas emissions at both a national level and in more local areas, such as provinces and cities.
With the finer details of the carbon reduction policy yet to be ironed out, government departments and provincial and city authorities have started to set their own emission-reduction targets and, in mid-August, state planning body the China National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) published a table of the energy control situation across the nation. With nine provinces marked red for their energy consumption, and a further 10 highlighted as yellow, officials received another motivation to introduce power rationing.
In terms of what happens next, the current approach of rolling blackouts seems unlikely to be a sustainable solution, given the damage it could inflict on industry and the resentment it would cause in parts of the huge nation already preparing for winter.
The binary choice apparently facing China's policymakers is whether to ramp up coal supplies to force prices down, by using decommissioned domestic supplies and halting the ban on Australian imports, or to raise electricity prices sufficiently to prompt generators to get the lights back on – and the production lines humming. While the drawbacks of raising household electricity bills will be obvious, the former approach could seriously endanger the nation's climate change commitments as the world prepares for the COP26 meeting in Glasgow next month. Sources close to the NDRC have suggested the electricity price may be set to rise soon.
What is clear, is the effect the energy crisis is having on the Chinese economy, and on the solar supply chain. Last week, leading up to Friday's national day holiday, the coal price in northern China rose to around RMB2,000 per ton ($310), three times higher than the level seen at the beginning of the year.
Investment bank China International Capital Corporation has blamed the dual control emission reduction policy for the electricity shortages and predicted a 0.1-0.15 percentage point impact on economic growth in the last quarter and the current window. Morgan Stanley has put that figure at 1% in the current quarter, if the current industrial output restrictions continue, and Japan's Nomura Securities has revised down its annual forecast on Chinese growth from 8.2% to 7.7%, with expected GDP gains in the third and fourth quarters reined in from 5.1% to 4.7%, and 4.4% to 3%, respectively.

Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) could drive large-scale rooftop solar adoption in India if accessible financing options become more readily available, according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and JMK Research.
The “Financing Trends in the Rooftop Solar Commercial and Industrial (C&I) Segment in India” report notes that much of the growth in installations has been driven by a few large, creditworthy entities. However, financial institutions are often reluctant to lend to MSMEs because they prefer borrowers with strong financial track records and good corporate credit ratings.
“MSMEs are as yet an untapped segment and could be the next drivers of growth in the market, especially considering the significant electricity cost savings offered by the adoption of rooftop solar,” said lead author Jyoti Gulia, the founder of JMK Research. “Textiles, food, and packaging are among the industries with lots of potential.”
The report notes that rooftop solar installations are financed through equity investments, debt capital, mergers and acquisitions, and loans or concessional financing such as the $625 million World Bank-State Bank of India (SBI) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and Tata Cleantech credit lines.
Since 2015, rooftop solar project developers have raised more than $2 billion, 48% ($985 million) of which came from equity funding and 29% ($599 million) from debt. Around 45% of these investments was raised in the first eight months of 2021 alone.
“The C&I rooftop solar segment has seen a sudden surge despite Covid-induced disruptions,” says Gulia. “This indicates a significant growth trend ahead.”
Almost all of the equity investments in rooftop solar came from foreign entities looking to tap the Indian market, given the high growth potential and healthy return on equity.
The report notes that over the last five years, most of the funds raised through the equity and debt routes have been concentrated among four active players in the segment: Amplus, Fourth Partner, CleanMax, and CleanTech.
“While these four players have been successful in raising funds for their projects and sustaining their business, the sector has seen many major players including Statkraft India, Sterling & Wilson, and Azure Power exit the market due to shrinking margins and regulatory setbacks by distribution companies (discoms),” says Gulia.
With a limited number of good, creditworthy customers having ratings above BBB+, this segment is becoming saturated, resulting in reduced demand that has led major developers to look at foreign markets with potential growth opportunities and also to build offsite open-access private solar parks that cater to the C&I segment.
On the other hand, MSMEs remain largely untapped. These face many barriers in obtaining financing for rooftop solar installations, including insufficient credit history, lack of collateral, and long-term uncertainties in their businesses. Renewable energy service companies (RESCOs), which own and operate solar plants for the consumer, are unwilling to work with MSMEs due to these uncertainties.
Steps taken
Credit enhancement schemes like the World Bank’s upcoming first-loss guarantee fund and a $41 million line of credit from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and DFC are examples of steps being taken to make financing for rooftop solar more accessible [to MSMEs], says co-author Vibhuti Garg, an energy economist at IEEFA.
“Schemes like these allow lenders to absorb risks and increase access to collateral-free loans. As well as loans available from national and regional banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) we are also seeing engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractors such as Tata Power Solar and Orb Energy starting to offer one-stop financing options bundled with their rooftop solar products,” said Garg.
The report notes this type of financing is likely to scale up, particularly as most big lenders and concessional credit lines are largely focused on the major rooftop solar developers. It also highlights positive developments such as Tata Power-SIDBI and Encourage Capital-Electronica Finance Limited tie-ups that specifically cater to MSMEs.

Scientia Professor Rose Amal of the UNSW School of Chemical Engineering researches and publishes prolifically in the fields of fine particle technology, photocatalysis, and functional nanomaterials. Even to most people working in photovoltaics, her work would seem arcane. And yet, UNSW has described her work's “profound implications for solar and chemical energy conversion applications such as … generating renewable hydrogen economically and sustainably.” And Amal herself is a wonderfully plain speaker.
When she was awarded the prestigious 2021 Chemeca Medal by the Australian and New Zealand Federation of Chemical Engineers last week, Amal described her research in recent years as focused on “harnessing solar energy to produce chemicals and fuels, such as hydrogen.”

Her LinkedIn feed is bursting with congratulations on the award, which specifically recognizes her research into catalysts for efficient energy conversion.
“Rose Amal, you continue to teach, learn, and inspire new generations of engineers and scientists. And with research that the world badly needs. Well done and congratulations to you,” posted Ian Phillips, general manager at Photon Water Australia, part of the Photon Energy Group.
Research papers she has contributed to represent the chemical bedrock on which future sustainability is being built. Or as the abstract of one 2021 paper explains, its findings “are valuable to solid-state electrochemical energy storage technologies that require high-efficiency charge transport.”
In January, Amal contributed to a breakthrough paper – “A hybrid plasma electrocatalytic process for sustainable ammonia production” – that describes a process of producing green ammonia from air, water and solar energy without the emissions or demands on energy and infrastructure made by the traditional Haber-Bosch method of ammonia production.
“The current way we make ammonia … produces more CO2 than any other chemical-making reaction,” said co-author Emma Lovell at the time. “In fact, making ammonia consumes about 2% of the world’s energy and makes 1% of its CO2 … We can use electrons from solar farms to make ammonia and then export our sunshine as ammonia rather than hydrogen.”
Storage and transport of hydrogen as ammonia will be safer and more economical. As a gas, hydrogen requires an exceptional amount of space for storage unless you liquefy or compress it. “But liquid ammonia actually stores more hydrogen than liquid hydrogen itself,” explained Amal. “And so there has been increasing interest in the use of ammonia as a potential energy vector for a carbon-free economy.”
In February, the NSW Office of the Chief Scientist and Engineer appointed Amal as the head of a consortium made up of researchers from UNSW, several other Australian universities, and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The remit of their combined NSW Power-to-X (P2X) Industry Feasibility Study is “to grow a new industry that will use cheap excess renewable energy to make fuel, chemicals and feedstocks to power a range of New South Wales infrastructure.”
At the Australian Renewable Energy Zones Conference in May, Amal talked about why using only batteries, a capital-intensive technology, to store renewable energy is a missed opportunity. With the P2X approach of converting excess renewable energy to chemical energy – as hydrogen, ammonia, methanol or hydrogen peroxide – “we can widen the reach of renewable power and repurpose it for use in other sectors while still maintaining stability in the grid,” she said.
These broadly applied chemicals “have historically been made in large, centralised industrial sites where capital costs and emissions are high,” said Amal, adding that they then have to be transported to a point of use.
Amal believes that a significant opportunity for P2X is to supply a new hydrogen export industry. Japan, South Korea and the European Union are among the markets  in line for Australia’s green hydrogen.
To advance this potential, Amal is also part of a consortium of research and industry partners, known as HySupply, that is led by UNSW Associate Professor Iain MacGill. It is investigating the feasibility of a renewable-energy-based hydrogen supply chain between Germany and Australia.
Amal, who arrived in Australia from Indonesia 38 years ago to pursue a degree in chemical engineering at UNSW, may have become accustomed to recognition. She has been awarded 2019 NSW Scientist of the Year and has received several prestigious engineering awards.
In the early 1990s, her passion for sustainability was “focused on designing particle and catalyst systems to treat chemical pollutants so that they would not end up in our environment,” she says.
Subsequently, the solar industry got lucky as she swung her skills toward designing nanomaterials for solar and chemical energy conversion applications, including photocatalysis for water and air purification and water splitting and engineering systems for solar processes that use the sun’s energy to generate clean fuel.
“Australia has abundant sunlight and we should do more in harnessing our solar power,” she says.

Investors, developers, and asset owners with commercially procured solar inverters may collaborate with U.S.-based independent test lab PV Evolution Labs (PVEL) on its Crowd Power Product Qualification Program (PQP).
The program, which does not require manufacturer participation, conducts tests on inverters to develop information that can help to mitigate technology risks and quantify product performance.
“Third-party data for inverters is notoriously difficult to obtain from manufacturers,” said C.J. Colavito, VP of engineering at Standard Solar. The Crowd Power PQP is designed to address this data access issue.
The tests largely mirror PVEL’s inverter PQP, which was introduced in 2014. Both programs include safety, reliability, and performance testing under various environmental and interconnection conditions.
As designed, the PQP will generate data sheet validation for what PVEL said would be more accurate performance and revenue models, reliability evaluations for improved operations and maintenance costs, and replacement rate forecast accuracy. It will also provide safety assessments for arc and ground fault detection.
The crowdsourced testing is intended to offer inverter buyers an opportunity to leverage empirical data over the claims of product marketing materials, said PVEL. Ginlong Solis and Chint Power Systems recently submitted 250+ kWh inverters for the traditional PQP, but PVEL said most inverter suppliers do not engage in independent testing that exceeds certification standards.
By contrast, solar module manufacturers more readily take part in PVEL’s PQP. Since 2012, some 50 panel makers have tested their panels with PVEL. Around 25 undergo frequent periodic testing. PVEL said module reliability has improved since the PQP launch. It said that its thermal cycling test has shown an average degradation rate reduction of 70% over that time.
