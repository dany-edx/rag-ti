It submitted a request for a construction permit in December and a preliminary project proposal to the local authorities last spring.
Groupe E will build the CHF 8 million ($8.6 million) hydrogen plant at the foot of the dam. It said the location is logistically ideal due to its proximity to the A12 and A1 motorways. The facility is set to produce around 300 tons of green hydrogen per year, which will be compressed and stored under pressure in 350 kg tanks for road transport.
H-Tec Systems, the hydrogen unit of German manufacturing and engineering company MAN Energy Solutions, will supply the facility's two PEM electrolyzers. “The two PEM electrolyzers will be supplied with more than 2 MW of green energy from a rotary turbine at the dam,” the supplier said.
Urs Kröpfli, a project manager for Groupe E, said the project will be “new territory” for the company. 
“The constructive, open, and transparent communication with H-Tec Systems as well as their experience with their own efficient PEM electrolyzers gives us confidence in the upcoming implementation phase,” he said.
Group E and Engie Services AG, the Swiss unit of French energy giant Engie, jointly set up the Swiss H2 Generation venture in 2019. The company specializes in the production of renewable hydrogen for the mobility sector.

Faulty connectors are among the most frequent causes of fires in rooftop solar arrays. One problem is cross-mating, which happens when connectors of different kinds are mated.
Viridian Solar said its ArcBox enclosure can be easily snapped around the outside of an MC4 electrical connector.
“Testing by Loughborough University and the KIWA fire test laboratories has confirmed that ArcBox safely contains a DC arc within the connector and prevents it from spreading to start a fire in nearby combustible materials,” it said. “The patented product also provides sufficient ventilation for the connector to remain within permitted temperature limits in normal use.”
It said that the use of connectors from different manufacturers has prompted regulators in many countries to prohibit cross-mating of different connectors. However, it is still difficult for installers to identify connectors from different suppliers.
Viridian Solar recommends the product for building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) projects. “We also see a requirement for ArcBox for above-roof solar systems installed over combustible roof coverings such as asphalt and single ply membrane and for solar on buildings that if put out of use, even for a short period, would have significant knock-on effects – such as hospitals, care homes, schools or factories,” it said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/12/uk-government-warns-of-global-warming-risks-related-to-hydrogen-leaks/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 12, 2022",UK government warns of global warming risks related to hydrogen leaks,"The UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has published a report describing the possible impacts of an emerging international hydrogen economy on the global climate.
Scientists from the University of Cambridge and the University of Reading explored the atmospheric impacts caused by hydrogen leakage. They calculated the radiative forcing resulting from hydrogen emissions and the global warming potential of hydrogen.
“Any leakage of hydrogen will affect atmospheric composition (with implications for air quality) and have an indirect warming effect on climate, partially offsetting some of the climate benefits of the reduction in carbon dioxide,” the scientists warned, noting that hydrogen leakage also reduces the tropospheric concentration of hydroxyl radicals. “Increases in tropospheric ozone, water vapour and methane, consequent on increases in atmospheric hydrogen, would all tend to increase radiative forcing, partially offsetting the climate benefits of a switch to hydrogen.”
Radiative forcing is a parameter defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that measures influence a given climatic factor has on the amount of downward-directed radiant energy impinging upon Earth’s surface.
The British scientists developed a new way to calculate Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) for gases whose emissions result in indirect radiative forcings. It considers the lifetime of a gas in addition to the lifetimes of the radiatively active gases causing the indirect forcing.
“This allows GWPs arising from indirect forcings to be calculated for gases with intermediate and longer lifetimes, such as hydrogen,” the scientists said. Several scenarios describing the atmospheric response to changes in the emissions of hydrogen were modeled and hydrogen leakage was found to affect the concentration of methane, ozone and water vapor in the atmosphere. 
“The changes in radiative forcing, like the changes in atmospheric composition, indicate that, to maximize the climate and air quality benefit of a transition to a hydrogen-powered economy, minimization of both hydrogen leakage and a reduction of the ancillary emissions of, for example, carbon monoxide, nitric oxide and volatile organic compounds is required,” the scientists concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/12/storing-renewables-with-brayton-pumped-thermal-energy-storage/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 12, 2022",Storing renewables with Brayton pumped thermal energy storage,"A group of scientists from Durham University in the United Kingdom has proposed the use of Brayton pumped thermal energy storage (PTES) for the storage of large-scale grid electricity, in the form of high-grade thermal energy.
PTES systems use a running thermal cycle to transform low-temperature heat into high-temperature heat and then store it in a thermal storage unit during charging. The systems allow higher storage efficiencies than the direct electric heating of the thermal storage unit and are purportedly a promising way to manage intermittent renewable energy. The technology modeled by the UK group is based on the so-called Brayton cycle and involves the use of reversible heat-pump and heat-engine cycles to store electricity in the form of thermal energy.
“The system operates as a heat pump cycle during charge followed by a heat engine during discharge,” the scientists explained. “Thermal energy is transferred to the working fluid during compression and expansion.”
The proposed Brayton PTES  system is based on thermal storage in packed beds, which includes heat transfer mechanisms within the system itself. The packed beds were modeled as well-insulated tanks storing thermal material without heat leakage. Latent heat storage, which exploits the melting and solidification phenomena of a phase change material (PCM) to absorb or release heat, was used to maximize the duration of the high power region and increase the overall efficiency of the system.
“The volumes of the tanks were increased and PCMs added downstream of the main storage section; the length of each store was increased by 50%,” the scientists said. “Specific analysis will be required in the implementation of individual PCMs with each system if they are to be commercially deployed in the future.
The system is based on a Brayton PTES concept demonstrated by UK-based Isentropic Inc. It consists of two insulated containers filled with crushed rock or gravel, a hot vessel working at high temperature and high pressure, and a cold vessel operating at low temperature and low pressure. The two vessels are connected via pipes and the whole system is filled with argon, an inert shielding gas that is mostly used in high-temperature industrial processes.
The modeled system was assumed to have a nominal power of 1 MW and a storage capacity of 4 MWh. It was based on packed bed hot and cold storage tanks relying on magnetite with a motor-generator connecting the compressor expander (CE) on a single shaft. Magnetite was selected due to its high specific heat, following a concept developed in the Isentropic demonstration system.
Through their modeling, the researchers found that the addition of latent heat storage could improve overall system efficiency to up to 80%.
“As discharge time was constrained by renewable energy source and market conditions, the objective of this study was to maximize the duration of the high power region and decrease the size of the power front in compressor expander (CE) device. This can be achieved by elongating the tanks and increasing the segmentation temperature ratio,” they said. “It is recognized that use of the highly efficient reciprocating CE devices contributed to the high predicted efficiency of the system and other assumptions such as ideal electro-mechanical conversion are also likely to reduce the energy reclaimed in discharge in a real system.”
They presented their findings in “Operation and performance of Brayton Pumped Thermal Energy Storage with additional latent storage,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.

The new product, initially launched in Australia, in March, has a nominal power of 425 W and a power conversion efficiency of 21.9%.
“The Vertex S+ is the latest milestone development on our way to bring high-end technologies such as bifacial n-type cells to rooftops of any size,” said Gonzalo de la Viña, the head of Trina's European module business. “We are fully confident in the dual-glass design as the most advanced module structure, which is reflected in our exceptional product and performance warranty. The Vertex S family with the newly added Vertex S+ has all we need to bring Europe under the same roof and accelerate energy transition in our part of the world.”
The module features multi-busbar triple-cut cells and features double-glass design in place of the conventional glass-and-backsheet structure.
“The use of thinner 1.6 mm heat-strengthened glass reduces module weight by 2.5 kg compared to standard dual-glass products, while withstanding high wind and snow loads,” the manufacturer said.
The panel relies on Trina's n-type PACO Cell technology, 210 mm diameter wafers, multi-busbar design, non-destructive cutting, and high-density packing. Trina said it should be available “soon” via distribution partners across Europe.

CST Composites is positioning itself as a “leading player” in the global green hydrogen supply chain. Last week, it announced a joint venture with Utah-based hydrogen storage tank supplier Optimum Composite Technologies.
The company wants to establish Australia’s first hydrogen vessel manufacturing facility, adding to the two specialist composite manufacturing facilities it already operates near Sydney. The joint venture with Optimum Composite Technologies will enable this vision, the company said, by giving it access to technical expertise for composite pressure vessels, which store hydrogen and natural gas.
The partnership will also give CST Composites greater access to US markets, allowing it to leverage Optimum’s US facilities, customer base and supply chain. In turn, CST Composites will expand its core capabilities in filament winding technology to support the growth of Optimum’s business in designing and producing composite pressure vessels.
“High-pressure gas storage vessels is one of the biggest and fastest-growing markets globally for advanced composites, particularly for filament-wound carbon fibre composites,” said CST Composites Managing Director Clive Watts.
The company says its plan will help advance Australia’s National Hydrogen Strategy, which has highlighted the need to develop the country’s supply chain infrastructure, including hydrogen storage tanks. It says it plans to secure government funding, as Australia is supporting the industry to become a global hydrogen superpower.
“We will be applying for the grants and financial support available to advance our projects, which focus on the innovative design and development of hydrogen and CPV [composite pressure vessel] products,” Watts said. “We are planning to make a significant investment to grow our new joint venture.”
Companies are starting to build manufacturing facilities for hydrogen tanks. For instance, South Korea’s Hanwha Solutions acquired US hydrogen storage tank manufacturer Cimarron Composites in December 2020.

Desalination is seen as a path forward to ensuring that coastal communities have a steady supply of clean drinking water as populations expand. Historically, desalination projects have struggled to scale widely, as the high amount of energy required to remove salt from ocean water creates costs and damages sustainability. 
A Canadian company has developed a product to address the energy and environmental concerns of desalination by making a modular, floating buoy that harnesses the power of the sun to power its sensors and the power of wave oscillation to turn ocean water into drinkable water. Oneka builds a self-contained, solar-topped device that harnesses wave power via a buoy that draw ocean water in through reverse osmosis, and then converts it to drinkable water.
Oneka said the system benefits from not requiring any land, nor any external sources of electricity. In comparison with a traditional diesel-powered desalination plant, Oneka said its solution can reduce costs by up to 70%.  The buoys are usually placed 0.1 miles to 2 miles from shore, with a depth of at least 35 feet. The units are not visible from the shore with the naked eye for most sites, said the company.
Waves that are just three-feet high are sufficient for the operation of the system, and the ideal wave sizes range between three to ten feet high. Oneka said the system can last 15 years, and regular maintenance checkups occur quarterly. Each buoy, depending on size, can produce between 1 cubic meter to 50 cubic meters of fresh water each day, and the modular design allows for easy additions of more buoys to serve increased water demand.
It is estimated that at current growth rates, the desalination industry will contribute 2 billion tons of CO2 emissions per year by 2050, more than twice the emissions of the aviation sector in 2019. A single buoy can abate about 34,000kg of carbon emissions each year, equivalent to the impact of about five to ten cars. Oneka said the brine produced by the desalination nodes is environmentally responsible, increasing the ocean water’s salinity by about 30% on average. Each buoy has its own inlet and outlet, allowing for a distributed discharge of salt that can disperse in the ocean quickly. 
The company said its product has applications in coastal communities, oceanfront resorts, and private islands. Its first commercially operating project is located in Fort Pierce, Florida, completed last year. Last June, Oneka secured a CAD 5.5 million ($4.36 million) funding round, and has investors across the globe, including Canada, the United States, United Kingdom, Belgium, Chile, and Germany.
“The world is running out of clean water and Oneka has a solution. It works, it’s affordable, it’s better for the environment, and it can be scaled from local disaster relief and regional demand all the way to meeting utility needs,” said Jonathan Saari, investment manager at Innovacorp, one of the leading investors in the funding round.
The US Department of Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) are pursuing modular, wave power-based desalination buoys, as well. A five-stage, $3.3 million contest aims to accelerate innovation in small, modular, wave-powered desalination systems capable of producing clean water in disaster and recovery scenarios, as well as in water-scarce coastal and islanded locations. The current NREL model, called HERO WEC, does not use solar.

British Columbia is a leader in the North American EV market, with light-duty EV sales representing 13% of all new light-duty vehicle sales in 2021. Transitioning to electric vehicles is important in achieving BC’s net-zero goal by 2050, but the challenge of recycling or repurposing the batteries remains.
Vancouver-based Moment Energy is addressing that challenge by developing a reliable low-carbon energy storage system from repurposed EV batteries with financial support from the CleanBC Go Electric Advanced Research and Commercialization (ARC) program. The company is building and testing a 120kW/h battery pack using the Renewable Energy Storage Laboratory at Dalhousie University. When complete, the company will deploy the system in a BC offgrid diesel-dependent scuba diving resort to gain real-world performance and environmental data. The project is expected to create and sustain 11 full-time-equivalent jobs in BC.
“By supporting innovation in clean tech, we are contributing to low-carbon economic recovery, helping realize our decarbonization potential and unlocking the innovation that B.C. has in store,” said Bruce Ralston, minister of energy and mines.
Based in Port Coquitlam, Moment Energy’s project is one of 17 projects under the second funding call of the ARC program. The ARC program supports BC’s EV sector by providing reliable, targeted support for research and development, commercialization and demonstration of BC-based EV technologies, services and products.
“This CleanBC project with Moment Energy will reduce the life-cycle environmental footprint of electric vehicles in our province and further our climate progress by finding creative new uses for older batteries to continue providing clean power,” said George Heyman, minister of environment and climate change strategy.
