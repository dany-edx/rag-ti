Yan Zhuang, president of the CSI Solar manufacturing operation of the company which is set for an IPO in China next quarter, today stated: “The era of ever-declining solar module prices is largely behind us.”
The comments were made on the Canadian Solar website as the company presented its fourth-quarter and full-year figures, and explain why the business is moving into energy storage on a big scale. In fact, Canadian Solar chairman and CEO Shawn Qu predicted the business would claim around 10% of this year's U.S. battery storage market.
The manufacturer and project developer had highlighted shortages of panel raw materials polysilicon, PV glass and backsheets in its third-quarter results and, although the associated hit in shipment volumes, margin and revenue was not as stark as feared in the final three months of the year, Zhuang said: “We are approaching the bottom of the solar cost curve,” and indicated near term module price rises.
The CSI Solar business unit chief said polysilicon prices had leapt another 25% “recently” although solar glass costs had started to come down and shipping expenses had shown signs of returning to normality after a Covid-affected year. The hit to Canadian Solar had been partially mitigated by the efforts of its “customers and partners,” said Yan, “who were able to share a portion of the higher costs.”
Canadian appears to be readying to draw a line between its manufacturing and project development operations with the planned IPO, which is expected to take place in the next quarter. CSI Solar will house the manufacturing operation and, Canadian revealed yesterday, its Chinese solar project business will also be bundled into the unit, with the remaining business devoted to non-Chinese project development–generation and battery storage assets.
The storage portfolio held by the company has trebled from less than 3 GWh a year ago to almost 9 GWh, according to Canadian Solar corporate VP Ismael Guerrero, with almost 1 GWh under construction. On the traditional generation side of operations, Canadian said it has a 20.2 GWp solar project pipeline, with 1.6 GWp under construction plus 3.8 GWp within four years of completion. That is despite an accelerated project sell-off in Mexico, Japan, Canada, Italy and the U.S. to help mitigate the revenue hit caused by rising solar production costs.
The bottom line saw fourth-quarter shipments fall 5% to 2,998 MW and, although revenue rose 14%, quarter-on-quarter–to US$1.04 billion–the net income for the company fell from the US$9 million banked in July-to-September to US$7 million. In full-year terms, net income fell sharply from US$172 million in 2019, to US$147 million last year, despite net revenue rising from US$3.2 billion to US$3.48 billion over the same period.
With the company repeating its intent to sell off 1.8-2.3 GWp of solar project capacity this year–rising to 4-4.5 GWp in 2025–Canadian said it expects to have shipped 3-3.2 GW of modules this quarter, to generate US$1-1.1 billion in revenue, at a margin of 16-18%. The company expects to ship 18-20 GW of panels this year for revenue of US$5.6-6 billion.

A good three months after the announcement, Swiss investor Energy Infrastructure Partners (EIP) has taken a 49% stake in German renewable energy company Baywa re, through an equity contribution.
Baywa AG, which will remain the majority shareholder of the company, with a 51% interest, will receive the money in March, after the relevant supervisory authorities in Germany, Austria and Australia should have given their approval.
This is the largest transaction in Baywa Group's history to date. “Now we can implement the growth strategy for Baywa re even faster and, together with … EIP, advance into new dimensions in renewable energies,” announced Baywa CEO Klaus Josef Lutz.
The partners agreed to further strengthen Baywa re's project, service and solution business. At the same time, the company should also be active as an independent power producer (IPP) in the future. As part of this, it is planned to operate selected photovoltaic and wind power plants with a total output of up to 2.5 GW in the medium term.
With the entry of EIP, Baywa re is converted from a GmbH into a publicly listed company. Matthias Taft, previously energy director of Baywa AG, will take over the chairmanship in the future.
Responsibility for the conventional energy business area will be transferred to Marcus Pöllinger, who will also be responsible for the construction segment and the agriculture, technology, and digital farming business areas. Lutz will take over responsibility for renewable energies in his role as chairman of the supervisory board of Baywa re AG, it was said.

Mondragon said the line will be the first of a series at the factory, where Karpat Solar is planning to begin manufacturing activity before the summer. “This will allow us to tackle the Romanian market in autumn 2021, in this first phase,” said the manufacturer's CEO, Csomor Karoly.
Modules produced at the facility should initially be sold in the domestic market, and in the European Union at a later stage. More details on the module technology used for production were not provided.
According to Igor Herrarte, international sales manager of Mondragon Assembly, the Romanian factory is part of a new wave of module manufacturing projects in Europe. “They will be projects of different natures, both in size and in the manufactured product,” he stated. “We also foresee a technological diversification as, in addition to the standard modules, we are going to see that companies launch modules for HJT (heterojunction), BIPV (building-integrated photovoltaics) technology, and other niche products suited to European demand.”
Indeed, the Swiss company Meyer Burger Technology recently stated that it is on track to successfully complete its transformation from a supplier of photovoltaic production equipment into a manufacturer of modules and cells. Furthermore, Norway's, Chinese-owned REC announced in late 2020 that it will build a 4GW HJT module factory in France, with work being expected to begin in June 2021.

While the estimate made by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) this week is bound to be welcomed by the solar industry, it was offered in a publication which spelled out the plans currently announced by the world's governments have us on track for 36.5 gigatons of carbon emissions in 2050–rather than the zero required.
IRENA on Tuesday published a preview of its forthcoming World Energy Transition Outlook report, to mark the two-day Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue event which closed in the German capital yesterday.
With renewables connected to 90% of the measures needed to avoid catastrophic global heating–carbon capture and removal and bioenergy are slated to complete the picture–the $115 billion per year invested in solar from 2017 to 2019 will need to rise to $237 billion annually from now until 2050 to attain the 1.5C aspiration, IRENA warned.
That is based on the estimate the world will need to add 840 GW of clean energy capacity annually to hit a cumulative 27.7 TW in mid century, up from 2.5 TW today. Solar is set to lead the charge, in generation capacity terms, with wind power needing to contribute 8.1 TW in 29 years' time.
A significant chunk of the electricity generated by all that solar and wind capacity will power green hydrogen–30%, according to IRENA, with the clean form of the energy-storage gas requiring almost 21 PWh of electricity in 2050, almost as much as the world's total electricity demand today. That will drive a need for an average 160 GW of electrolyzer capacity annually to 2050, although the slow start envisaged will see the biggest ramp up after 2030, with 400 GW of electrolyzers to be built in 2050, according to the report.
In terms of costs, IRENA said the $98 trillion governments intend to spend on the energy system to mid century needs to be buttressed by a further $33 trillion to achieve 1.5C. Of that $131 trillion, $116 trillion–$4 trillion per year–must be spent on energy transition technology, and around $24 trillion of the cash earmarked for fossil fuels needs to be redirected into clean energy which, as IRENA constantly reminds us, reportedly generates three times as many jobs as the fossil fuel industry, for each $1 million invested.
The international agency's view that natural gas can continue to play a part in the global energy mix in 2050–not to mention nuclear and even coal–is bound to cause disquiet in some quarters. IRENA said gas consumption in a 1.5C world could peak in 2025 but still supply 2.2 trillion m3 in 2050, down from 4.2 trillion m3 today, mainly for heat, balancing the energy system, and generating blue hydrogen. Oil could decline 80% from 2018 levels to just over 11 million barrels per day in mid century, for petrochemicals, aviation and shipping; and there would be residual coal use–with carbon capture and storage–in the steel and chemical industries.
Offering a hint to the potential geopolitical rifts that could be opened up by the energy transition, IRENA wrote of the need for “transparent, secure, sustainable and fair supply chains” for copper, lithium, cobalt, platinum and rare earth metals, and added: “These transformative changes cannot be left to markets alone.”

“The tracker has a modified shape and a new navigation and control software,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The tracking system was modified by adjusting the axis heights and maximizing the rotation angle for the module to plus or minus 70 degrees, which allows the devices to operate synergistically with the agricultural equipment used. Furthermore, the manufacturer designed a specific control and agronomic-orientated monitoring system to improve crop production, land quality and address the specific needs of each project.

“Our two-in-portrait (2P) module wings, equipped with bifacial modules, allow us to space module rows to support efficient agricultural operations–such as moving large vehicles–between module rows or monitoring sites for agricultural variables to increase generation efficiency,” said Ideematec CEO Mario Eckl.
The trackers will be used for a 100 MW portfolio comprising multiple 5 MW agrivoltaic projects that will be built at unspecified locations in France.
“Agri-PV projects require flexibility in both the hardware and installation to protect the integrity of the land and ensure that agricultural practices can operate effectively while harnessing the benefits of clean energy,” said Amda's president, Jorge Gutiérrez Serra. “We are confident that Ideematec’s durable and customizable solar trackers will fit the needs of an innovative energy system optimized for highly profitable agricultural production for years to come.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/18/key-indicators-to-identify-the-best-photovoltaic-heat-pump/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 18, 2021",Key indicators to identify the best photovoltaic heat pump,"Solar-powered heat pumps have attracted a lot of attention in recent years, promising low carbon heating through a wide range of applications. Their technical and financial viability, however, remains subject to different views, with some claiming that payback time is still too long and others saying their performance is still behind the required level to ensure that heating or cooling are efficiently provided to a household or a building.
According to Celena Lorenzo, a researcher at Spain's Technical University of Madrid, PV-powered heat pumps (PVHPs) are set to become a fully developed technology in the next few years and a mainstream solution by the end of the decade. “I believe the barriers are mainly economic and are related to initial investment for the PV generator,” she told pv magazine. “But the performance of these systems is already good enough.”
Celena also explained that the main technical problem with PVHPs is the storage requirement for certain applications. “For example, if the system needs to be used at night time,” she stated, noting that photovoltaic-thermal systems could be better suited for heating applications, although they will probably remain inefficient for cooling. “Heat pumps powered by PV alone, instead, are efficient for both cooling and heating and are more reliable as they require fewer components and have less possibility of failure,” she explained, adding that resorting to PV alone may also help reduce the upfront cost significantly, as solar panel prices are constantly decreasing.

The payback period of a solar-powered heat pump, so far, is estimated by Lorenzo at around 10 years for industrial applications and a bit longer for residential installations. “I believe the cooling market is more promising because there is a better match between PV generation and thermal demand,” he further explained. “On the other hand, warmer hours are usually sunnier and less storage is needed.”
In a study that dates back to October 2019, Celena and another Spanish scientist, L. Navarte, analyzed different solutions for PVHP systems that were designed or tested in previous works and have described a series of existing and new key performance indicators (KPIs), which are not aimed exclusively at evaluating the quality of heat pump or the PV generator, but also the quality of their integration.
In the paper, the two researchers specified that the influence of local climate conditions may limit the use of conventional KPIs. “The same high-quality PVHP will have a lower value of Performance Ratio (PR) in Spain than in Denmark just because the mean ambient temperature in Spain is higher, leading to higher thermal losses in the PV system,” the study reads. “These losses are not related to the quality of the system but to the operating climatic conditions in the location where the PVHP has been installed.”
The PR is not the only indicator affected by local conditions. Three of the mentioned indicators – the Seasonal Performance Factor (SPF), the Coefficient of Performance (COP), and the Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER), are also defined as highly dependent on the ambient temperature. “This dependence is not linear and is not the same for different technologies and models of HPs,” the scientists explained. “This makes it very difficult to compare the performance results of studies carried out in different climatic regions.”
Other indicators are the Self-Consumption Ratio (SCR) and the PV Solar Fraction (SFPV). The latter represents the share of the total electricity consumed by the heat pump that has been generated by the PV installation and, in combination with the former, is crucial for assessing the quality of the connection between the heat pump and the solar array.
The researchers propose a series of new indicators which they claim overcome the above-mentioned limitations. The Performance Ratio at Standard Test Conditions (PR25), which they defined as having the same meaning as the PR but eliminating the thermal losses at different ambient temperatures, and the Performance Ratio measured with a reference PV module at Standard Test Conditions (PRref,25), which is described as able to reduce the effect of different climatic conditions and time spans, as it considers irradiance and the cell temperature with a reference PV module in the same plane of the generator.
Furthermore, they propose a ‘Seasonal Performance Factor for PVHP systems' (SPFPV-HP), which combines the traditional SPF with the PR, SCR, and SFPV, and the Seasonal Performance Factor for PV-HP systems at Standard Test Conditions (SPFPV-HP,ref,25). The last indicator is independent of the climatic conditions and time span, but only regarding the PV generator. “It is calculated from the PRref,25 and can take a value between once and twice the traditional SPF,” Lorenzo explained.

The new product is available in two versions with different sizes and power ratings.
The most powerful of the products, dubbed Bisol Duplex BBO 435-455 Wp, is available in five versions with power ratings ranging from 435 to 455 W. The panel is made with 144 high-efficiency, half-cut monocrystalline cells and features an efficiency of between 19.6% and 20.5%. The open-circuit voltage is between 49.4 V and 50.4 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 11.25 A to 11.45 A. These modules measure 2,110×1,050x40mm and weigh in at 24 kg.
The smallest panel, called Bisol Duplex BDO 360-380 Wp, is made with 120 half-cut cells and is available in five versions with a power output of 360-380 W and a conversion efficiency ranging from 19.4% to 20.4%. These modules have a size of 1,770×1,050x35mm and a weight of 20 kg. Their short-circuit current ranges from 11.25 A to 11.45 A while the open-circuit voltage is between 40.9 V and 42.1 V.
Both products can be used with operating temperatures ranging from -40 degrees Celsius to 85 degrees Celsius and their operating temperature coefficient is -0.35% per degree Celsius. They are enclosed between 3.2mm high transparency, tempered glass surfaces and also feature an MC4 connector and a junction box with an IP 68 rating. The maximum system voltage for both modules is 1,500 V. They come with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee.
“The impeccable module efficiency and robust durability make them great for all industrial and commercial projects and the aesthetic value, on the other hand, makes them a perfect choice for all residential installations,” the manufacturer told pv magazine. “In practice, the bigger, and higher-power Bisol Duplex will probably be used more often in commercial and industrial projects while the [residential projects] will use the smaller, 120-cell version. However, it all depends on the customer’s preferences and, of course, the roof properties.”
The modules are made with 166x166mm wafers, which Bisol said provide, currently, the best power and size ratio. “While the material level suggests the use of larger wafer; on the module level, we meet certain limitations that do not make sense, cost-wise, such as cutting the cell before lamination and constant investing,” the company explained. “It is a matter of appropriate vertical optimization of cost structures in the production chain to enable the acceptable price of solar electricity.”

“The aim is to launch an ecosystem for the hydrogen economy that aims to be an important reference point on a national scale for research, innovation, and technology transfer, but, above all, hydrogen-related industrial sectors,” Giorgio Graditi, director of the department of energy technologies and renewable sources at ENEA, told pv magazine, adding that part of the hydrogen will be produced by a photovoltaic system linked to an electrolyzer of around 200 kW.
The hydrogen valley is part of the ‘Mission Innovation' strategy, an initiative through which 24 member states and the European Commission are committed to doubling public research funding. The funds come directly from member states.
In the €14 million hydrogen valley, ENEA will install a commercial alkaline or polymer electrolyzer, and research advanced electrolyzers.
“We are working on advanced solutions to increase the conversion efficiency of electrolyzers and the hours of operation, which are critical aspects on which we need to intervene,” said Graditi, mentioning well-established alkaline and polymer electrolysis but also the need to push the technology frontier, embracing technologies such as AEM–electrolyzers with an anion-exchange membrane–or high-temperature electrolyzers.
Graditi explained that, while today's electrolyzers reach around 200 MW of capacity, electrolyzers of at least 1 GW should be available by 2025. That would imply a reduction in installation costs of between €400-600 per kilowatt and electricity consumption of 50 kWh/kg for electrolyzers operating at low temperatures.
The project will use Italian funds under the Mission Innovation initiative. “Italy has significant expertise in the sector,” Graditi affirmed. “Just think of SOLIDpower, in fuel cells, and Denora and Nuvera for electrolyzers. Italy can play a key role in this game, counting on a ready-made industrial chain and research centers of international importance, where a clear political direction will be key, able to enhance green technologies according to the principle of technological neutrality and within a coordinated and integrated national action.”
According to Graditi, the investments could also have repercussions on the production of photovoltaic panels in Italy. “A hydrogen economy could help increase the production in the EU area of photovoltaic modules required to generate renewable energy to power electrolyzers,” he also stated. “Therefore, also in Italy, we could see a revival of PV module production chains and the enhancement of those already existing.”
ENEA is the technical and scientific advisor to the Italian Ministry of Economic Development for the IPCEI on hydrogen (important project of common European interest). It has identified the interest of 150 Italian companies ready to collaborate. At the national level, it is working on evaluating the projects proposed by these companies to create a national production chain within the European context.
Italy is also speaking with other European countries, mainly Germany, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Portugal, and Spain. “It's about cooperation and a common vision for a European hydrogen economy,” Graditi said. At this time, meetings are taking place at the European level with the commission's Department of Growth, Germany, and France to define the next steps for the hydrogen IPCEI. The question now is whether to prioritize the readiest technologies or those more consistent with the European framework. Germany is likely to be the “lead country”; it should lead the definition of the overall European document for the IPCEI.
On 8 July, 2020, the European Commission launched the European Hydrogen Strategy with a twofold objective: on the one hand, to promote and extend the use of hydrogen as a replacement for fossil fuels, and, on the other, to decarbonize production, giving priority to green hydrogen, but also considering other low-carbon production processes. The IPCEI and the hydrogen valleys around Europe meet the objectives of the European strategy. The color of hydrogen will also depend on other, ongoing discussions, such as taxonomy, the set of rules that defines which investments are green and which are not.
“Ours is a technology-neutral approach because we have to consider that all transition processes have to be gradual,” Graditi emphasized. “Green hydrogen is undoubtedly the goal but mature technologies [that are] already part of national manufacturing chains must be exploited and used for this transition. This is the case for blue hydrogen. There are various national interests in this, such as those of Eni, Saipem, and Snam.”
According to Graditi, the competitiveness of green hydrogen will only be achieved when the price will fall below €2 per kilogram. He added that reaching these levels will depend on private investment as well as European investment through the IPCEI on hydrogen and other instruments such as the recovery fund. “The ideal five-year period is 2025-2030 to achieve this challenging objective.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/18/timing-is-everything/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,IRELAND",,"MARCH 18, 2021",Timing is everything,"From pv magazine 03/2021
New analysis of the value solar delivers in Ireland is changing the way solar is viewed in the country. Crucially, it found that that the solar bid price, in the next auction of the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS), could be €8-13 higher per megawatt-hour than for onshore wind projects – and the cost to Irish consumers would be the same. The bid price for solar could be substantially higher than competing technologies, and Irish society would still benefit.
When the Irish Solar Energy Association (ISEA) challenged AFRY Management Consulting to model the system, the scale of the effects that they found were not predicted. The view at the outset was that perhaps solar had potential benefits that were not captured in the RESS price. In other words, there was a “hidden value” that was not reflected in the actual price.
This topic is important both in the near and medium term. In the first auction (RESS-1), close to 800 MW of utility-scale solar was successful, meaning that over the course of 2021-23, these projects will be rolling out at volumes previously unseen in the market. In the jargon of the sector, Ireland plans to be a “fast follower,” with the second auction (RESS-2) coming later this year.

With a further 1 GW of solar potentially qualifying for RESS-2, the two main competing technologies are expected to be onshore wind and solar. The auction results are determined based on the levelized cost of energy, on a €/MWh basis, with wind being widely recognized to hold an advantage. Policy decisions around auction design will be key to energizing renewables across the mid-2020s and achieving 2030 energy targets.
Using independently sourced assumptions and their market modeling software, AFRY modeled three scenarios: No Solar Ambition (NSA) – existing and RESS-1; Low Solar Ambition (LSA) – 2.5 GW by 2030; and Higher Solar Ambition (HSA) – 5 GW by 2030.
A compelling result was the difference in emissions between the NSA and the HSA scenarios. In the HSA, annual emissions are reduced by 7% in 2035. This effect is due to the solar assets running during the day, which work to displace gas assets in the merit order. AFRY admitted that both the effect and its scale were surprising.
This timing effect also impacts the cost of support. The PSO levy is payable by electricity consumers and is used to support the deployment of renewables. The levy is determined by the difference between the power price and the achieved auction price (adjusted for capacity market revenues). Solar assets tend to run during traditionally higher price periods, meaning the gap between the auction price and the power price is lower on average, reducing the level of support.
This is how solar can simultaneously secure a higher auction price and a lower cost of support – an effect that AFRY found to be substantial.
When the combined carbon and support savings are compared to the costs of buying that power, it results in a net annual saving in the scenarios where solar deployment increases. This outcome ranges between €54 million and €106 million in 2035, which is equivalent to €10-21 per Irish citizen.
The research also found reduced levels of curtailment for renewables in the HSA, compared to the NSA. Therefore, increased levels of PV positively impact both the solar and wind sectors.
While this research found a solar diversification effect for the system, the question is what to do about it as a society? ISEA favors an option whereby the technologies face competitive pressure from peer projects, with the maintenance of a solar preference category in the next RESS auction. An alternate mechanism would be the use of a factor (termed Evaluation Correction Factor in the RESS-1 ruleset) which could adjust the auction price offered by solar projects to account for the €8-13/MWh pricing effect. While it may affect auction price, it may not drive out the true price for all technologies.
In the past few years, Ireland’s electricity network has achieved significant milestones, with up to 70% renewable penetration achieved regularly, due to the large volume of wind on the system. It is now time for Irish solar to contribute to this success story. As the report shows, there are significant benefits to doing so. With the correct policy framework, solar will contribute to both the electricity sector and wider society. The sun could shine brightly for the sector. How often is that said about Ireland?

Despite all the challenges of 2020, the U.S. solar industry broke several records.
The U.S. Solar Market Insight 2020 Year-in-Review report, released by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie, found that the industry installed a record 19.2 GW of capacity last year. That was a 43% increase from 2019 and bested the market’s previous annual record of 15.1 GW set in 2016.
California, Texas, and Florida were the top three states for annual solar capacity additions for the second straight year. In 2020, 27 states installed over 100 MW of new solar capacity, a record.

Annual residential solar deployment rose 11% from 2019, reaching a record 3.1 GW. However, the report said this was lower than the 18% annual growth in 2019, as residential installations were impacted by the pandemic in the first half of 2020.
Annual non-residential installations fell 4% from 2019, with 2 GW installed in 2020. The report said the pandemic impacted this segment, too, through delayed project interconnections and prolonged development timelines.
For the second year in a row, solar led all technologies in new U.S. electric-generating capacity added, accounting for 43% in 2020.

The U.S. solar industry also saw its biggest quarterly gain ever in the fourth quarter, adding 8 GW of new capacity. For perspective, the market added 7.5 GW of capacity in all of 2015.
The report said there was a historic 6.3 GW of utility-scale projects installed in the fourth quarter of 2020, bringing the annual total just shy of 14 GW. The report said that 5 GW of new utility solar power purchase agreements were announced during the quarter. That brought the volume of project announcements in 2020 to 30.6 GW and the full utility-scale contracted pipeline to 69 GW.
For the first time, Wood Mackenzie also released a long-term forecast as part of the U.S. Solar Market Insight report series. By 2030, it expects that the total operating U.S. solar fleet will more than quadruple, installing a cumulative 324 GW of new capacity to reach a total of 419 GW.
Michelle Davis, senior analyst from Wood Mackenzie, said the two-year extension of the investment tax credit at the end of 2020 will drive greater solar adoption and led to a 17% increase in deployment in the report’s 2021-2025 forecast.

“After a slowdown in Q2 due to the pandemic, the solar industry innovated and came roaring back,” said SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. She said that the forecast shows that by 2030 the equivalent of one in eight American homes will have solar.

The dream of every new Australian home being solar powered just got a whole lot closer: RedEarth, an Australian designer and manufacturer of lithium-ion battery storage systems, has signed a multimillion dollar contract with a major housing developer to offer solar and batteries to buyers of its new homes around Australia — those who participate will also be linked into a high-returns virtual power plant (VPP).
CEO and co-founder of RedEarth, Charlie Walker, told pv magazine Australia that the deal will encompass thousands of Australian homes over time, with the first tranche of solar-enabled residences currently under construction.
He’s not naming the developer just yet, but says more details of the agreement will soon be revealed.
Homebuyers can opt for a minimum 6.3 kW solar system (no battery), or a solar-battery combination that completely powers their electricity needs, no grid required — and many configurations in between. They will also be eligible for subsidies or interest-free loans as offered in their state of residence.
Benefits of integrating solar at building stage include the lower costs enabled by bulk-buying and manufacture, as well as consistency of installation for contractors.
“In Australia,” says Walker, “you’ve got more than enough energy hitting people’s roofs every day to create an excess of electricity. It’s just smart to make, use and store your own power, and to monetize the excess.”
RedEarth uses the software of another innovative and proven Australian technology provider to securely monitor and manage energy production and use in its VPP.
By selling excess energy back into the grid when energy prices are high, or offtaking for other energy users, he calculates the RedEarth VPP will realize “up to 80 cents a kilowatt-hour” for excess residential generation.  The management system will constantly optimize the price it can get for its customers’ energy.
RedEarth’s platform can support the grid and VPP member interests by coordinating its participants within a particular postcode to supply energy locally at a slightly better price than other providers can when supply to that area is unable to meet demand for a period of time, says Walker, and as its capacity grows it can also help moderate grid-wide shortages.
Even though they won’t get as high a return, customers on the RedEarth platform can also choose to sell their energy back to their electricity provider, such as Origin or AGL, for a credit that they can then pass on to relatives or friends.
“A better return than you get from Warren Buffet”
Walker says RedEarth treats every solar system in its VPP as an investment, and provides quarterly reports on the returns each system has generated.
Other benefits of this VPP include constant monitoring of solar/battery performance via secure telemetry; the system raises an alarm with RedEarth if generation isn’t up to expectations or if a fault occurs.
“We aim to call the customer before they call us,” says Walker.
And VPP participants can contact RedEarth if they want to increase the capacity of their system, say, when they buy an electric vehicle and need more battery storage to power their commute.
Walker says that even though Australia leads the world in rooftop solar uptake, with one in four homes now generating their own energy, the mass movement has yet to be realized.
“This is early stages, but we do see that every rooftop in Australia becoming its own power plant is a way to intelligently set up a renewables-capable grid.”
RedEarth released its first Personal Power Plants in 2019, after several years of development and testing; and also supplies Australian engineered and manufactured products to the off-grid and large-scale energy storage markets.
He says existing homes that want to join its new VPP are welcome, but RedEarth believes that at this stage of Australia’s renewable transition targeting new builds is “the way to get the most progress, most quickly”.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/18/report-outlines-rooftop-solar-and-storage-for-75-of-puerto-ricos-power-and-at-a-lower-cost/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,PUERTO RICO",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MARCH 18, 2021","Report outlines rooftop solar and storage for 75% of Puerto Rico’s power, and at a lower cost","From pv magazine USA
Adding solar and storage to every home in Puerto Rico, plus solar on commercial sites, could provide 75% of the territory’s electricity by 2035. And the cost of doing so could be lower than a base case that simply projects today’s grid and generation mix ahead to 2035, said a report from nonprofit groups Cambio and IEEFA (Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis).
Rooftop solar on houses could reach 2.7 GW, paired with 2.5 GW of storage, with a comparable amount of solar on commercial sites. “Minimal upgrades” to the distribution system would be required, the report said.
The investments would be supported with $9.6 billion of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grid reconstruction funds. Money was allocated in response to grid damage caused by hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017 and is expected to be dispersed soon.
The 75% solar plan would shift the direction of Puerto Rico’s grid. A 10-Year Infrastructure Plan prepared by utility PREPA calls for spending the FEMA funds to harden PREPA’s centralized transmission and distribution systems. And money also would be used to build new natural gas infrastructure. But no money would be directed toward renewable energy and storage, the Cambio/IEEFA report said.
The proposed 75% solar scenario shows that no need exists for new fossil fuel generation, or for converting existing units to natural gas, the report said. The scenario also would enhance resilience in future hurricanes, reduce fossil fuel costs, and require no transmission investment. If supported with federal funds, the rooftop solar scenario would yield average electricity costs of 15 cents per kWh, versus 21 cents per kWh now. Scenarios also were modeled for 25% and 50% solar generation by 2035.
The 75% scenario would exceed the standards of Puerto Rico’s Act 17-2019, which requires PREPA to obtain 20% of its electricity from renewable resources by 2022, 40% by 2025, 60% by 2040, and 100% by 2050.
The Cambio/IEEFA report is based on utility modeling analyses conducted by power systems analysis firm Telos Energy and utility data analysis firm EE Plus. The two firms used PREPA grid data that Cambio and IEEFA obtained through a public records request.
Telos modeled Puerto Rico’s grid using the production cost model PLEXOS, and also modeled transmission system power flow. EE Plus modeled distribution system power flows. In the report, Telos suggested achieving a reliable high-solar grid by introducing fast-frequency response synchronous condensers and grid-forming inverters, and conducting further study of grid reliability options.
Clean energy consulting firm Energy Futures Group used the grid modeling results to estimate costs. Solar and storage were modeled as being financed by PREPA at a 6.5% cost of capital, and a carbon price was assumed. Without a carbon price, and assuming no capital costs for new generation in the base case, the 75% solar scenario was slightly less expensive than the base case.
Energy Futures also analyzed energy efficiency measures that could cut consumption 25% by 2035. That efficiency target was proposed by Queremos Sol, a Puerto Rico coalition of community, environmental, and labor groups.
PREPA’s capacity expansion model “was not capable of simulating distribution system investments,” the report says, and PREPA instead assumed 13% of generation from rooftop solar by 2035.
