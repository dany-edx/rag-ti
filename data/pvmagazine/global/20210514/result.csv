The size of individual electrolyzer projects is growing rapidly. “Today, most electrolyzers have capacities of less than 10 megawatts (MW). As early as 2025, a typical plant will be 100 to 500 MW, producing hydrogen for direct-connected consumers. By 2030, plant sizes will increase to 1 GW and more, coupled with large-scale projects producing hydrogen for export in countries with cheap electricity, said Aurora Energy Research, referring to its recent hydrogen market report. The Oxford-headquartered research institute suggests that electrolyzer capacity should grow from 0.2 GW to 13.5 GW by 2040, “a one-thousand-fold increase”. The majority of the electrolyzer projects are in Europe (85%), with Germany planning 23% of global electrolyzer capacity. In terms of electrolyzer capacity in 2030, the Netherlands should follow Germany (9 GW) with 6 GW. In Europe, Aurora also singles out Italy, Poland and the UK for their low-carbon hydrogen plans.
The Multistack platform built to enable the testing of increasingly powerful modules from the reversible solid oxide fuel cell/electrolyser (rSOC) technology is now operational, French research institute CEA-Liten announced. Powered by a 450 kVA electrical input, this new tool of the Innovation Laboratory for New Energy Technologies and Nanomaterials (CEA-Liten) allows, in its current configuration, to test modules operating in fuel cell and/or electrolysis mode with a power of up to 120 kWDC.
Chile's Minister of Energy and Mining, Juan Carlos Jobet, approved the first green hydrogen project in Chile. The Highly Innovative Fuels' (HIF) Haru Oni project is a partnership between Enel Green Power Chile (EGP Chile), a subsidiary of Enel Chile, Chilean electricity company AME and state-owned ENAP, together with Germany’s Siemens Energy and Porsche. The project will use Siemens Energy's Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer to produce hydrogen from wind, using a 3.4 MW wind turbine. The project will use green hydrogen, combined with CO2 captured from the air, to produce synthetic methanol. Lastly, 40% of the methanol should be converted into synthetic gasoline.
The Norwegian government proposed to double to €20 million its allocations for hydrogen as part of the revision of the 2021 national budget. “This year's state budget already includes NOK 100 million, and now another NOK 100 million is proposed,” reads a note released on Tuesday. The new funds will target infrastructure and market development (NOK 85 million), as well as a new research center focused on hydrogen and ammonia (NOK 15 million). The research center will receive NOK 30 million a year (€3 million) for the eight years to 2030. According to the government, infrastructure development involves “establishing hubs and supply chains that facilitate the commercial use of hydrogen.” Enova, an enterprise owned by the Ministry of Climate and Environment, will manage and operate pilot and demonstration projects. In 2020, Norway’s private consumption registered a -7.6%, but public consumption increased by 1.7%.
German car manufacturer BMW said it would unveil a hydrogen fuel cell SUV in 2022. “We are conducting research into e-fuels and hydrogen. Next year we will unveil a BMW X5 with a fuel cell drive. A small series of the BMW i Hydrogen NEXT will show how we envision the hydrogen drive train,” Chief Executive Officer Oliver Zipse said on Wednesday. The plans are in line with a declaration made in 2019, when BMW said it “would start offering fuel cell vehicles for customers in 2025 at the earliest, but the timing very much depends on market requirements and overall conditions.”
Spain’s state-owned railway operator Renfe announced that would prioritize low-carbon technologies in its pending contracts for new trains. The board of directors agreed to re-tender the purchase of 72 medium-distance and commuter trains. The company explains that “the decision of the board of directors responds to Renfe's commitment to environmental responsibility […] and means adhering to the clear commitment of European and Spanish institutions to clean energies and, in particular, to renewable hydrogen.”

The company intends to invest  RMB 3 billion (around $465 million ) in the factory, which will have a capacity of 5 GW for both cells and panels. The first phase of the project, with a capacity of 1 MW, will be finalized by the end of this year. Another 1 GW of production capacity should be deployed next year and the remaining 3 GW by 2024.
China's largest solar cell manufacturer, Tongwei, announced on Wednesday an increase in the prices of its solar cell products, just five days after the last increase. The company's quoted price for both polycrystalline and mono PERC single/double sides cells (166 mm) climbed by 7 cents to RMB 0.83 and RMB 0.99 per watt, respectively. The price of mainstream mono PERC single/double sides cell measuring 158.75 and mono PERC single/double sides cells (210 mm) were priced at RMB 1.02 and RMB 0.99 per watt, respectively, with an increase of 6 cents.
Module maker Longi also announced an increase in price for all its mono-crystalline wafer prices. The latest price for the G1 product (158.75mm) is RMB 4.39 per piece, with an increase of RMB 0.49 (or 12%) compared to the previous price. The price for M6 wafers (166mm) is now RMB 4.49, with RMB 0.49 and a 12.3% increase. For the largest M10 (182mm) wafers, the price increased by RMB 0.53, around 10.9%, to RMB 5.39 per piece.
Polysilicon manufacturer GCL-Poly on Wednesday confirmed the June 4 creditors’ meeting required to vote on its plans to issue replacement three-year senior notes for $500 million worth that were not settled when they fell due at the end of January. If creditors approve the proposal, it will be sanctioned a week later.
There was another sign of the easing of solar glass supply shortages on Tuesday as PV glass supplier Xinyi Solar reduced the amount of float glass it will buy from float glass manufacturer and controlling shareholder Xinyi Glass in the second half of the year. Having capped the volume at 115,000 tons during the first six months, at a cost of no more than RMB 305 million ($47.3 million), Xinyi Solar extended the agreement to the end of the year but will buy a maximum 45,000 tons for no more than RMB 120 million ($18.6 million) from July to December. Xinyi Solar said rising solar glass volumes in the first three months of the year meant module manufacturers were in less need of its processed float glass as an option for the back cover of panels. The company also added two of its own solar glass production lines in the first quarter, taking its daily melting capacity from 9,800 to 11,800 tons, further reducing its external float glass demand.

“Our research shows that the solid-state battery could be fundamentally different from the commercial liquid electrolyte lithium-ion battery,” said researcher Xin Li. “By studying their fundamental thermodynamics, we can unlock superior performance and harness their abundant opportunities.”
The battery can be charged and discharged at least 10,000 times at high current density, the scientists said. Its multilayer design is described as a structure in which a less-stable electrolyte is sandwiched between more stable solid electrolytes that are able to prevent any lithium dendrite growth. This architecture was then combined with a commercial high energy density cathode material.

“Think of the battery like a BLT sandwich,” the Harvard group explained. “First comes the bread — the lithium metal anode — followed by lettuce — a coating of graphite. Next, a layer of tomatoes — the first electrolyte — and a layer of bacon — the second electrolyte. Finish it off with another layer of tomatoes and the last piece of bread — the cathode.”
The first electrolyte, which the academics designated with the chemical name Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5, or LPSCI, is more stable with lithium but subject to dendrite penetration. By contrast, the second one, dubbed Li10Ge1P2S12, or LGPS, is more immune to dendrites despite being less stable with lithium. Under this configuration, dendrites are allowed to pass through the graphite and first electrolyte but are stopped right before the second.
“The cycling performance of the lithium metal anode paired with a LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathode is very stable, with an 82 per cent capacity retention after 10,000 cycles at a 20C rate and 81.3 per cent capacity retention after 2,000 cycles at a 1.5C rate,” the academics emphasized. “Our design also enables a specific power of 110.6 kilowatts per kilogram and specific energy up to 631.1 watt hours per kilogram at the micrometre-sized cathode material level.”
The battery, according to the academics, also has self-healing properties, as it should be able to backfill holes created by the dendrites. Its creators claim it has the potential to recharge electric vehicles within 10 to 20 minutes.
The device design was described in the paper “A dynamic stability design strategy for lithium metal solid-state batteries”, published in nature.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/14/new-discovery-promises-to-bring-singlet-fission-enhanced-c-si-solar-cells-nearer-to-commercial-production/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 14, 2021",New discovery promises to bring singlet fission enhanced C-Si solar cells nearer to commercial production,"Singlet fission is the quantum mechanics that could allow breaking the theoretical barrier for the efficiency of silicon photovoltaic cells. It consists of a photophysical process in molecules and molecular aggregates, whereby a singlet exciton generated by irradiation splits into two triplet excitons, which means a single photon, or particle of light, can generate two electron-hole pairs as it is absorbed into a solar cell rather than the usual one.
A group of scientists from Australia's University of New South Wales (UNSW) are working to integrate singlet fission into conventional crystalline silicon (C-Si) solar cells. “The ultimate efficiency for limit singlet fission PV was determined in 2012 by Tim and Murad [Timothy W. Schmidt and Murad J. Y. Tayebjee], both co-authors of the present study, at 45.9%,” UNSW Professor Nicholas Ekins-Daukes told pv magazine. “Realistically on silicon, we would like to achieve efficiencies above 30%.”

The group claims to have discovered that singlet fission enhanced solar cells may not only provide higher energy yields compared to traditional crystalline silicon solar cells but also have lower operating temperatures and lower degradation levels. In the paper Singlet fission and tandem solar cells reduce thermal degradation and enhance lifespan, published in Progress in Photovoltaics, the researchers demonstrate spectroscopically the key advantages that both tandem cells and singlet fission cells may have in terms of temperature behavior and lifespan. The degradation of singlet‐fission layers, on the other hand, has been considered for decades one of the main challenges for the development of commercially viable solar cells based on this technique.
The scientists analyzed the performance of a perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell and a singlet fission device based on tetracene, which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon known for being able to generate triplet excitons that are energetically matched to the silicon bandgap. “While considerable efforts are underway to identify stable alternatives, tetracene is currently the only singlet fission material to have demonstrated energy transfer into silicon,” the study notes. “Importantly, ditetracene (the degradation product of tetracene under oxygen‐ and water‐free conditions) is transparent to solar radiation.”

The Australian group explained that the advantages of the technique would remain even if degradation of singlet‐fission layers occurs, as it would not affect their transparency and the solar cells would return to their usual performance levels but having gained the benefits of improved energy yields for the stable duration of the tetracene layer.
“Since the degradation product of tetracene singlet fission film is transparent to solar radiation, it will revert to standard c‐Si solar cells after the ‘benign' degradation process, and the temperature and efficiency of tetracene singlet fission/Si module converges to that of the conventional c‐Si module,” the study emphasizes.
The singlet fission cell was made with a single molecular film and an interlayer deposited on the front of a conventional silicon solar cell. It is claimed to be able to operate at lower temperatures than the conventional C-Si cell for the first five years of operation.
When asked about the costs of the proposed technique, Ekins-Daukes said there was the opportunity to build devices based on a single molecular layer that is carefully deposited on a silicon PV cell, similar to the silicon tandem cell architecture. “It is too early to say whether this approach will be more cost-effective than a silicon tandem cell but, as we discuss in the paper, there are strong reliability advantages to the approach.” The new technology could build upon the huge investment made in silicon cell manufacturing and could be utilized in space-limited situations, like on solar electric vehicles. “Their enhanced behavior in the higher energy part of the spectrum also makes them ideal for situations with attenuated red and infrared light,” Ekins-Daukes further explained.
Several research projects have been conducted in recent years on singlet fission applied to photovoltaics, including work from the Advanced Science Research Center at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

“Solar industry analysts from Credit Suisse, CICC, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JP Morgan and seven institutional investors joined the in-person tour of the Company’s state-of-the-art facilities,” it said in a statement, adding that journalists from various media including Bloomberg, Financial Times and China’s Global Times were among the observers. The company scheduled a similar field trip for another group of 35 solar industry investors and analysts from domestic Chinese institutions on May 12, it continued.
pv magazine’s  UP Initiative spent Q2 2021 looking at what solar and energy storage companies can do to lead by positive example when it comes to the workers, often far removed, involved in the production of their products and services. Supply chain traceability and polysilicon provenance were key topics.
The reason for the presence of observers was the alleged use of forced labor that has been reported for several manufacturers located in Xinjiang by international media in recent times. “As stated repeatedly, we do not condone the use of forced labor under any circumstances,” said Daqo CEO, Longgen Zhang. “Furthermore, our visitors were able to see that our chemical process, which is highly automated, digitalized, technology-intensive, is not conducive to employing unskilled labor.”
The factory visit was documented in a video published by the company in its press release.
Daqo has previously issued a statement on the matter in January, when first media reports on the alleged use of forced labor arose. “The Company considers the idea of employing ‘forced labor' or ‘prison labor' as not only morally abhorrent but also wholly inconsistent with its goals to be successful in terms of safety, efficiency and costs,” it said at the time.

“This is a very big problem and it hits the roof of our farmers and horticulturists,” said the association's director, Nico Verduin, adding that the affected PV system owners should be somehow compensated for their losses.
The trade body cited as an example a dairy farmer located in Friesland, one of the Netherlands' most affected provinces in terms of grid constraints, who deployed a PV array based on 800 solar modules. “After paying the costs, however, he received a message from the grid operator that no more electricity may be injected into the grid,” it explained. “This means that this dairy farmer will suffer considerable financial damage as he spends a lot of money every month on interest, depreciation and maintenance of the installation, for which there is no income.” The access to the grid, according to LTO Noord, has been denied until 2024.
The case is not isolated and many other farmers are being left without a grid connection approval, the association added. “There are also companies that were initially notified that they could be connected to the grid, but were suddenly unable to do so after they received the subsidy.”
The Netherlands has been experiencing grid capacity issues across several provinces since last year. Several solutions are being proposed to improve capacity and deploy an increasing number of solar parks and rooftop PV systems, including shared connection points between solar and wind, using bi-directional EV recharging stations, coupling rooftop with heat pumps, and hydrogen production.
Dutch power company Liander recently implemented several measures to increase grid capacity in several Dutch regions. These include the deployment of two giant transformers and the application of congestion management to a bottleneck in the grid.
In November, Netbeheer Nederland and Dutch renewable energy associations De Nederlandse Vereniging Duurzame Energie (NVDE) and Holland Solar signed a preliminary agreement to ensure faster and cheaper grid connection of large-scale solar power plants to the network.
The Netherlands could reach between 38 GW and 125 GW of total installed solar capacity by 2050, according to a recent report by Netbeheer Nederland, the Dutch association of national and regional electricity and gas network operators.

Lightsource BP said on Thursday that it has secured approval from the New South Wales Department of Planning and Environment for its 400 MWdc (350 MWac) Wellington North Solar Farm, which will be built next to the 200 MWdc (174 MWac) Wellington Solar Farm, which is currently under construction.
The Wellington North project, which was acquired from AGL last year, will be constructed on a 970-hectare site near Dubbo, New South Wales.
“We are very excited about the planning approval of our Wellington North Solar Farm, this is an important step forward in our ambition to help Australia transition to a lower carbon future,” said Lightsource BP Australia Country Manager Adam Pegg. “In a few years our 600 MWdc Wellington solar hub will be producing 1,173,000 MWh of renewable electricity, the equivalent to powering 170,000 Australian homes, saving 938,000 carbon emissions annually.”
The project will use 1.2 million bifacial solar modules and will link to the grid via a 330 kV transmission line connected to Transgrid’s Wellington Substation. The development approval ruled out the installation of a battery storage facility or system but the department said there was nothing preventing Lightsource BP from seeking to modify this consent to install a battery storage facility in the future.
The company has indicated that construction of the solar farm is due to begin soon. The project is expected to generate 400 jobs.
Since partnering with BP in 2017 and entering the market in 2018, Lightsource BP has developed a significant pipeline of large-scale solar projects across Australia and Wellington North is the latest addition to the portfolio.
The company, which has commissioned 1.3 GW of solar capacity and manages approximately 2 GW of capacity under long-term operations and maintenance contracts globally, expects to commence construction of its 107 MWdc West Wyalong Solar Farm in NSW and the 210 MWdc (176 MWac) Woolooga Solar Farm in Queensland later this year.
The 200 MWdc Wellington Solar Farm is close to completion and when operational, the plant will produce approximately 435,000 MWh of clean electricity a year. Most of the project output has already been contracted by Snowy Hydro via a 15-year power purchase agreement..
Together, the Australian portfolio exceeds more than 900 MWd. Once operational, it will make Lightsource BP one of the largest solar owners and operators in Australia.
Frederic Baudry, the president of BP Australia, said the projects form part of the company’s transition from an international oil company to an integrated energy company.
“We are proud to be progressing strong positions in renewables and contributing to Australia’s, and BP’s, net zero by 2050 ambitions,” he said.

The company said the 20 MW Golomoti solar plant will be linked to storage capacity of 10 MWh and will begin commercial operation by the end of the year. The plant is under construction by Infraco Africa, a unit of U.K.-based Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG), and Canadian private equity firm JCM Power.
“The inclusion of lithium-ion batteries behind the meter at this scale will be a first in sub-Saharan Africa, demonstrating JCM's position as a leader in deploying leading technologies and innovation for solar-storage projects,” Sungrow said in a statement.
The project is being developed about 100 km southeast of the capital, Lilongwe, and will be connected to the adjacent Golomoti substation, which will operate a 132 kV transmission line to supply the national grid. The plant will sell power to local utility ESCOM under a 20-year PPA.
Once completed, the installation should almost double the country's PV capacity, which stood at around 24 MW at the end of 2020, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.
With a population of approximately 19 million people, the landlocked nation has a power generation capacity of around 363 MW, around 90% of which comes from hydropower. Access to power in Malawi’s rural areas is currently only 4%, with 42% in urban areas. Overall, electricity access is only 11% and the government aims to increase that figure to 30% by 2030.

The Union Cabinet chaired by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved an extension of the national production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to include advanced battery storage manufacturing.
The scheme, with an outlay of INR18100 crore ($2.5 billion), will incentivize global and domestic companies to build 50 GWh of cumulative advanced chemistry cell (ACC) capacity and 5 GWh of “niche” ACC production facilities in India. The fiscal incentives are proposed under the umbrella initiative of the National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage, which aims to reduce India’s ACC import dependence.
While several companies have already started investing in battery packs in India, there is still negligible investment in ACC manufacturing. As a result, India has to meet all of its ACC demand through imports.
Globally, manufacturers are investing in ACC battery storage technologies at a commercial scale, as demand for such batteries is expected to boom through 2030. This is due to the robust growth of electric vehicles, advanced electricity grids, and rooftop solar.
Under the PLI scheme, India will provide incentives to domestic and global companies setting up ACC battery manufacturing plants. The manufacturers will be selected through a transparent, competitive bidding process.
The selected bidders will have to commit to set up ACC manufacturing facilities of a minimum 5 GWh to 20 GWh. They will also need to ensure a minimum of 60% domestic value addition at the project level within five years. The manufacturing facilities will have to be commissioned within two years. The incentives will be disbursed after that over periods of five years.

The American Solar Grazing Association has launched a two-year project to collect and analyze data on the agricultural, economic, and environmental impacts of co-locating agricultural enterprises such as commercial beekeeping and sheep grazing on photovoltaic sites.
Tthe New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) is backing the project. It has provided a $198,000 research grant through its Environmental Research Program. NYSERDA is joined in supporting the project by the New England Division of American Farmland Trust and Juniper Economic Consulting.
The study will collect data from solar installation sites co-located with beekeepers and/or grazing herds, as well as conventional, standalone operations for comparison. Lexie Hain, the executive director of the American Solar Grazing Association, said that the researchers are looking for most sites to be grazed.
Data will be collected during the 2022 and 2023 grazing seasons. The study will aim to address questions regarding the quality and profitability of farm products from solar sites, trends in soil health on agriculturally managed solar sites, and the benefits to farmers of working with the solar industry.
The full list of solar sites to be studied has yet to be finalized, but a number of sites owned and operated by Nexamp, a leading developer of community solar in New York State, will be included. Two sites will be grazed with sheep owned by a family-owned grazing operation in Orleans, New York.
Nexamp is looking to quadruple the number of solar sites being grazed in the 2021 season. The company said that sheep are less likely to cause damage to photovoltaic equipment than traditional vegetation management.
The American Solar Grazing Association is still looking for solar participants in the study, however. It will accept applications until the end of August.
Beekeeper Mike Kiernan of Vermont-based Bee The Change will also take part in the study. Kiernen said he sees solar sites as a vital habitat for honey bees, as well as the hundreds of species of native bees, butterflies, and wasps that collectively transform blossoms into vegetables and field crops.
And while the project is funded by NYSERDA and is largely confined to New York and adjacent states, Hain said that the findings should be useful to farmers and solar developers across the country.
The work builds on “Grazing Sheep on Solar Sites in New York State: Opportunities and Challenges,” a 2018 pilot study by Cornell University. The study was preliminary in nature and the solar industry has undergone significant change since 2018, but the basics still hold true. Sheep can provide vegetation management for solar farms, the vegetation that the sheep ingest is healthy for them, and economic opportunity exists for farmers who want to develop additional revenue streams.
As Hain describes it, the newly launched study aims to evolve the idea from a niche business opportunity to a legitimate industry adjacent to solar. Researchers know that sheep can be symbiotic to solar installations; now they want to grow the scale of that relationship and develop diverse, credible testimony both from solar project owners and the grazers and beekeepers involved.

The objective of the Energy Independent Farming (EIF) partnership is to take big agricultural enterprises offgrid, powered by renewable energy, while generating enough green hydrogen through electrolysis to replace all of their diesel energy consumption. In April, EIF secured AUD 250,000 ($193,160) in Victorian government funding, under the Australian state’s Agriculture Energy Investment Plan, to develop a replicable model.
“According to our models, any farm of around 8,000 acres and beyond is a candidate for energy independence,” said Thomas Blair of the Blairfarms dynasty, which grows grain near Horsham, Victoria.
His operation, which also specializes in lentils and chickpeas, uses around AUD 200,000 worth of diesel fuel per year. That diesel powers  the farm machinery and Blairfarms’ grain-cleaning facility, which runs on diesel-generated power 14 to 18 hours a day.
“Because we’re remote in terms of the grid, we can’t hook up to three-phase power,” Blair told pv magazine Australia. “We’ve been pricing it up for years.”
However, he says that now the price point for going offgrid is comparable – with numerous greater benefits.
Blair was formerly in the armed forces. After his last tour of Afghanistan, he spent a few years with his mother’s family in Denmark. “I needed a bit of time to clear my head,” he said.
It was in Europe that renewable energy infused his consciousness.
“You could go into any household in Denmark, and it wouldn’t be long until the conversation turned to renewables,” he said.
When he returned to Victoria last year, just before the pandemic hit, Blair familiarized himself with the farm accounts. He realized just how much the business was spending on diesel, and the extent of the emissions that were being generated.
“That’s how we formulated our first grant application,” he said. He filed for an energy audit, which set him on a crusade to reduce the farm’s emissions, “starting with our electricity demands.”
He began with the idea of rooftop solar on farm buildings, to power their needs and perhaps convert the farm’s three forklifts to run on electricity. The plan kept expanding.
“When I compared fuel-cell EVs versus your standard lithium-battery EVs, I thought, ‘hydrogen has a lot of potential’,” he said.
His research led him to international energy consultant Bradley Warren, who is also the director of Eco U Construction, a building services business based on the Queensland Sunshine Coast that has integrated solar-battery solutions into large real estate and other developments in Australia and overseas.
Energy Independent Farming is the formalization of their new business partnership. It is designed to help farmers contribute to Australia’s decarbonization, save money on energy, and thereby secure their livelihoods as climate conditions for agriculture become less predictable.
This agricultural-renewables journey will begin onsite at Blairfarms, with the installation of three 30 kilowatt solar arrays. It will initially investigate the viability of sodium-ion flow batteries to ensure constant power availability, alongside “a new type of inverter that can step it up to three-phase power,” Warren told pv magazine Australia.
Hydrogen production is a second planned step, using scaled-up PV and perhaps supplementary wind generation. There’s also potential, depending on emerging technologies, to skip batteries and “go straight into hydrogen fuel cells as our storage mechanism, as well as the prime way to move our vehicles and farm machinery,” said Blair.
