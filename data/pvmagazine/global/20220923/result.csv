https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/23/chinese-pv-industry-brief-eging-to-set-up-10-gw-of-topcon-solar-panel-production/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,INVERTERS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA",VINCENT SHAW,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2022",Chinese PV Industry Brief: Eging to set up 10 GW of TOPCon solar panel production,"Eging PV said this week that it has signed a deal with the authorities in Chuzhou, Anhui province, to build a 10 GW TOPCon solar module factory. The new plant will include 10 GW of wafer capacity and will require an investment of around CNY 5 billion ($705 million). Eging said that 67% of the investment will be for factory buildings and equipment, while the other 33% will support its working capital needs. It now has 5 GW of cell capacity and 10 GW of module capacity.
Tongwei has signed a deal with the authorities in Yancheng, Jiangsu province, to invest around CNY 4 billion in a 25 GW solar cell factory. By end of June 2022, the company had more than 230,000 metric tons (MT) of polysilicon capacity and 54 GW per year of annual solar cell production capacity. Tongwei plans to have 800,000 MT of polysilicon capacity by the end of 2024 and 102 GW of solar cell capacity by the end of 2023.
Jolywood said the first 4 GW phase of its TOPCon solar cell factory in Shanxi province has been completed. The manufacturing facility will eventually have a total capacity of 8 GW. The panel producer currently has total 4 GW of TOPCon cell capacity and 3.5 GW of PV module capacity.
GCL New Energy said this week that its first-half losses for shareholders came in at CNY 514 million, rather than the CNY 300 million that was expected. Electricity sales revenue slumped due to its continued sell-off of solar projects, as well as a CNY 144 million foreign-exchange hit, despite revenue of CNY 558 million.
Beijing Energy International reported a net profit for shareholders of CNY 181 million in the first half, down from CNY 371 million in January-June 2021. Revenue rose to CNY 1.99 billion, from CNY 1.31 billion a year earlier. It said its 4.58 GW portfolio, comprising 97 solar parks and seven wind farms, generated 3.32 TWh of clean power in the first half of 2022, up from 1.74 TWh in the same period last year.
China Power International Development has raised CNY 1.47 billion by diluting its ownership of four solar project companies. The state-owned utility retained a 36% stake in each of the businesses, which have passed to a clean power investment special purpose vehicle (SPV) controlled by CP Guorui. The SPV was partly capitalized with CNY 1 billion by China Power in April.
Irico New Energy has posted a first-half net profit for shareholders of CNY 61.1 million, down significantly from CNY 215 million in January-June 2021. The company said big volumes of solar glass production capacity have been coming online since June, dampening prices. It posted six-month revenue of CNY 1.1 billion, down from CNY 1.18 billion in the first half of 2021.
China Glass Holdings said this week that it is moving forward with the construction of fabs to produce solar panel glass, as its new energy-saving glass division accounted for just CNY 25.2 million of its total first-half gross profits of CNY 426 million. It said its main float glass business has been buffeted by problems in the real estate market and more expensive raw materials. China Glass posted a first-half profit for shareholders of CNY 121 million, down from CNY 302 million during the same period of 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/23/bluetti-unveils-modular-energy-storage-system-at-ifa-2022/,"SPONSORED,EUROPE,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2022",Bluetti unveils modular energy storage system at IFA 2022,"Last week Bluetti showed off its latest innovations at IFA in Berlin, Germany. Its offering included the AC500+B300S combo, AC200 series, and the long-rumored solar system-EP600+B500 three-phase system that features a 6kW inverter and maximum 79kWh LFP battery capacity.
The modular design of EP600 significantly shrinks the overall weight and size. The system weighs 123.4 pounds and measures 25 inches by 12.8 inches by 13.3 inches. Packed with a 6000 W bi-directional inverter for AC input and output, the system provides AC power at 230/400V to easily run almost any household electric appliances, the company reports. Besides, the EP600 also supports up to 6000 W solar input from 150V to 500V range and has a reported 99.9% MPPT solar efficiency.
As an expansion battery, B500 is tailor-made for the EP600 system. It features 4,960 Wh ultra-durable lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells, an aluminum alloy appearance, and is the same size as EP600. Every EP600 supports up to 16 battery modules to reach a total 79.3kWh capacity, which Bluetti says can cover all power needs at home or off-the-grid for days or even over a week. EP600 and B500 can be stacked to save space inside or out.
What sets the EP600 apart from other solar generators is the hybrid inverter at the heart of the system. This simplifies operation because, as Bluetti explains, it is operated by simply plugging the solar panels into the generator. , which means all you need to do is plug solar panels into the solar generator. No solar inverter or MPPT controller is required.
Bluetti reports that the EP600 and B500 system will be available by the end of the fall in Europe, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The pre-order is expected to start before November on BLUETTI’s official website. You may subscribe here to get an early bird price and stay up to date with the latest news on Bluetti’s new solar power system. According to James Ray, marketing director for Bluetti, the combination of the EP600 and B500 will sell for less than $9,500.
Note that as a three-phase 230V/400V system, this EP600 and B500 system is not applied to countries with 100-120V utility grid voltage. Another whole home power system is currently under development for those living in the United States and Japan.

The 18-month wind-powered pilot in Saint-Nazaire, France, will operate near the shore for the first six months, before it is moved to a site 20 kilometers off the coast of Le Croisic. The project will be installed less than 1 km from the floating wind turbine. It will use wind power to pump, desalinate and purify seawater. The platform, developed by Geps Techno, will operate automatically. Plug Power supplied the electrolyzer. “By 2030-35, offshore could represent an additional installed capacity of around 3 GW for Lhyfe.” The company collaborated on the project with Chantiers de L'Atlantique, the Port of Saint-Nazaire, Kraken Subsea Solutions, Pays de la Loire Region, and French energy and environment agency ADEME.
SSAB, LKAB, and Vattenfall have commissioned the HYBRIT pilot facility, which will store fossil-free hydrogen gas in Luleå, Sweden. “The rock cavern storage facility is the first of its kind in the world for storing fossil-free hydrogen gas,” wrote Vattenfall. After initial pressure tests with water in June, the 100-cubic-meter storage facility was filled with hydrogen gas and reached a maximum operating pressure of 250 bar. The two-year test period will continue with test campaigns to collect data until 2024. “HYBRIT technology will be used for the production of fossil-free sponge iron on a large scale at a first demonstration facility in Gällivare,” said Lars Ydreskog, director of strategic projects at LKAB. 
École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) researchers have developed a bulk heterojunction photocathode that can reduce water to hydrogen in a pH 9 electrolyte by organic semiconductor selection and replace the conventional metal oxide hole transporting layer with an organic self-assembled monolayer charge selective layer. “The optimized photocathode produces a photocurrent density of >4 mA cm−2at 0 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) for solar water reduction with noticeable operational stability (retaining ≈90% of the initial performance over 6 h) at pH 9,” the researchers wrote in “An Organic Semiconductor Photoelectrochemical Tandem Cell for Solar Water Splitting,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials. Combining the optimized BHJ photocathode with a benchmark BHJ photoanode leads to the demonstration of a large-area (2.4 cm2) organic photoelectrochemical tandem cell for complete solar water splitting, with a predicted solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 0.8%, said the researchers.  
The International Energy Agency (IEA) says that the energy crisis has expanded interest in hydrogen, but wider policy support is needed to drive new uses in heavy industry and long-distance transport. “The encouraging developments in hydrogen technologies that can support the clean energy transition include an expected sixfold increase by 2025 in global manufacturing capacity of electrolysers, which are needed to produce low-emissions hydrogen from renewable electricity,” wrote the IEA in its yearly “Global Hydrogen Review.” Global capacity to manufacture electrolyzers now stands at 8 GW per year, but based on industry announcements, it could exceed 60 GW a year by 2030. “If electrolyzer projects in the pipeline are completed and the planned scaling up in manufacturing capacities takes place, costs could fall by around 70% by 2030 compared with today,” said the IEA. If all projects now in the pipeline come to fruition, the production of low-emission hydrogen could reach 16 million to 24 million tons per year by 2030, with more than half of it coming from electrolyzers running on renewable energy, it said. 
Rethink Technology Research says that hydrogen transportation costs could be more important than production costs in defining the amount of hydrogen consumed globally. “Importing hydrogen to resource-rich countries will add between $0.50 and $1.86 per kilogram, depending on the distance and the means through which it can be transported. With distribution accounting for nearly two-thirds of the final cost of hydrogen to the customer, these delivery mechanisms will dictate competition throughout the hydrogen market,” the consulting company wrote. Its report suggests that pipelines and liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) will dominate the future of hydrogen trade.
The US Department of Energy (DoE) has opened applications for a $7 billion program to create regional clean hydrogen hubs (H2Hubs) across the United States. The project is part of the $8 billion hydrogen hub program funded through President Joe Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The DoE aims to select six to 10 hubs. Concept papers are due by Nov. 7, 2022, and full applications are due by April 7, 2023. 
The European Commission has approved a second Important Project of Common European Interest to support research, industrial deployment, and construction of relevant infrastructure in the hydrogen value chain. Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, and Sweden are participating in the project, and will benefit from up to €5.2 billion in public support. “We will also increase our financial participation in Important Projects of Common European Interest,” said Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The company will deliver 50 MWh of capacity in 2023, 100 MWh in 2024, and 100 MWh in 2025. Green Energy’s parent company, Nicon Industries A/S – a manufacturer of steel and aluminum in the wind, offshore, and maritime industry – aims to build 1 GW of storage projects within the three-year period, according to a company statement.
“EnerVenue’s technology features exceptional longevity and durability with minimal maintenance required, and its fire-safe properties are especially critical in our expected applications,” said Henrik Jensen, CEO of Nicon Industries.
EnerVenue claims that its nickel-hydrogen batteries have lifespans of more than 30 years, through more than 30,000 cycles without experiencing degradation, along with overcharge, over-discharge, and deep-cycle capabilities. The company also claims costs per kilowatt-hour as low as a penny, as well as capital expenditure costs that beat lithium-ion batteries.
Unlike lithium-ion, metal-hydrogen batteries excel operating in conditions of extreme heat and extreme cold, the company claims. The solution operates optimally in ambient temperatures from -40 F to 140 F (60 C). Because of this, the battery purportedly comes with no risk of fire or thermal runaway and includes no toxic materials, making it recyclable.
These properties are especially crucial for safety and compliance in maritime and offshore projects, where Nicon plans to deploy the storage solutions over the long term. The batteries will initially be deployed onshore, for large construction and heavy industry projects, packaged into customized building blocks. The solutions will have to meet DNV certification and CE certification mandates to be deployed in the offshore and maritime market.
“By 2024, Nicon's forklifts will be converted from fossil fuel to electric power and will be charged with Green Energy battery containers,” said Jens Juul, COO of Nicon. “Additionally, the power needed for our sea fastenings jobs on wind installation vessels will be supplied from our own battery containers charged overnight with renewable energy coming from the wind farms.”
In June, EnerVenue agreed to provide 460 MWh of its batteries to Sonnell Power Solutions for large-scale renewable and storage applications in Puerto Rico. In May, Pine Gate purchased 2.4 GWh of the company’s batteries. In spring 2021, the company signed its first major distribution agreement with Hong Kong’s Towngas.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/23/mxenes-based-perovskite-solar-cell-achieves-23-66-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2022",MXenes-based perovskite solar cell achieves 23.66% efficiency,"A group of scientists in China has designed a perovskite solar cell based on a functionalized two-dimensional titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx), which is also known as MXene.
MXenes compounds take their name from their graphene-like morphology and are made via selective etching of certain atomic layers from a bulk crystal known as MAX. Recently, MXenes materials have shown promise for use in PV technology due to their unique optoelectronic properties, such as their large charge carrier mobility, excellent metallic conductivity, high optical transmittance, and tunable work function (WF).
The research team used two surface-functionalization strategies for MXene with dodecyltrimethoxysilane and fluoroalkylsilane (FOTS) molecules, respectively, to form a self-assembled monolayer on the MXene itself.
“At first, we added unmodified MXene to the electron transport layer (ETL), which didn’t have a big impact,” said researcher Li Yin. “However, we realized that slightly adjusting the chemical structure of the MXene may also modify the other materials in the electron transport layer. This would reduce barriers to electron movement and improve the performance of the solar cells. We were right.”
According to the researchers, the functionalized MXene dopants resulted in a larger grain size and a higher open-circuit voltage for the PV device. The solar cell architecture consists of an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, an electron transport layer (ETL) based on Tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) and doped with MXene-H, the perovskite layer, a spiro-OMeTAD hole-blocking layer, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
The champion solar cell built with this configuration achieved a power conversion efficiency of 23.66%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.095 V, a short-circuit current of 25.07 mA/cm2, and fill factor of 83.18%. A reference cell without MXene-H achieved a power conversion efficiency of 20.98%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.062 V, a short-circuit current of 25.01 mA/cm2, and fill factor of 80.60%.
“Both optimal devices show higher moisture-resistance stability and operation stability,” the scientists said. “For light stability, it is clear that after 1,000 h of illumination, the device based on SnO2-MH as the ETL maintains almost 80% of its initial efficiency.”
They presented the cell technology in “Functionalized-MXene-nanosheet-doped tin oxide enhances the electrical properties in perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Cell Reports Physical Science. The research group includes academics from the University of Science and Technology of China, the Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, and the University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom.
“This work provides a promising potential direction toward achieving high-quality SnO2 ETLs, and we believe that the desired modifications to the dopant could further enhance the device performance preferably,” they concluded.
Separately, another international research group recently conducted a review to find out how two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides known as MXenes could be used as materials for solar cells. They presented their findings in “2D MXene: A Potential Candidate for Photovoltaic Cells? A Critical Review,” which was recently published in Advanced Science. The research group includes scientists from Dongguk University, Korea University, and Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU).
“This systematic review is both expected to provide a way to realize the diverse nature of MXene composites from a different perspective, and open new directions to find solutions for next-generation PV applications,” the scientists said.

The central bank said it also aims to support hybrid renewable-powered electricity, heating and cooling systems, and the production of renewable energy technologies.
“(The) policy on green bond financing for banks and financial institutions has been formulated with a view to facilitating green focused sustainable investment on climate change  mitigation and adaptation,” said the central bank.
The policy will support the development of the emerging green bond market in Bangladesh and facilitate financial flows between banks and financial institutions. It will  therefore support the country’s plan to transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient, environmentally sound economy, said Bangladesh Bank. Officials have said that the nation's bond market has yet to grow, but recently green sukuk bonds have been used to raise funds to set up 230 MW of solar in the northern part of the country.
Renewable energy sector stakeholders have praised the green bond financing policy, as they have been demanding such an initiative for a long time. Dipal C Barua, president of the Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association, said that entrepreneurs prefer the bond market to source funds, as it long-term loans are available at low interest rates.
“When we interact with members they say they won’t be able to run business with short-term loans,” said Barua.
Barua said solar panels can now be expected to remain efficient for around 20 years, and that is set to gradually grow to 30 years. “If long-term cost effective loan from green bond markets is available, it will help boost renewable energy generation,” he said. 
Bangladesh currently has the capacity to generate 911 MW of green power, mainly from solar. By 2041, the country wants to generate 40% of its electricity from renewable sources.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/23/swiss-grid-operators-to-raise-tariffs-for-surplus-solar-by-average-of-55-in-2023/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,SWITZERLAND",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2022",Swiss grid operators to raise surplus solar tariffs by average of 55% in 2023,"From pv magazine Germany
In Switzerland, operators of PV systems that inject surplus solar power into the grid will receive significantly more money in the coming year. Network operators will increase remuneration by an average of 55%, which means average rates may rise from CHF 0.101 ($0.10)/kWh to CHF 0.155/kWh on average.
The Swiss Association of Independent Energy Producers (VESE) said there is still no guarantee that operators of PV systems in Switzerland will receive remuneration that covers rising electricity costs. VESE is therefore calling for a new remuneration model.
The new figures from VESE are based on information from the 30 largest network operators. They determine the remuneration for surplus solar power fed into the grid every year.
VESE said it welcomes the fact that solar power is finally being upgraded as a reliable and ecological mainstay of domestic renewable energy generation. The association noted that “even notorious brakemen among network operators” have finally reached and exceeded the threshold of CHF 0.10/kWh, which VESE has been demanding for a long time.
But this does not happen entirely on a voluntary basis. VESE said this is mainly due to the fact that under the current legal situation, producers with load profile measurement could switch very easily. They could therefore also sell their solar power on the futures markets, where the effective price is currently between CHF 0.20/kWh and CHF 0.30/kWh.
“The network operators were therefore forced to counteract this migration by massively increasing their remuneration. In view of the high market prices, they might otherwise have missed out on the relatively cheap electricity from independent producers,” said VESE.
While the operators of PV systems are now benefiting from higher electricity prices, the association also noted an “unwanted effect” caused by the sharp increase in remuneration. Prices for electricity consumers would also rise, as network operators would pass on the higher payments to consumers.
VESE is in favor of a system that secures the financing of PV systems over the long term, but does not come at the expense of electricity customers. This production cost-oriented “fix model” is supplemented with an associated, purely market-oriented “flex model,” which is popular with associations, politics and administration in Switzerland. The “flex model” allows operators to also participate in the free market if they wish, but with all the advantages and disadvantages.

Evelon, a building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) solar module manufacturer, has opened a facade panel factory in Bavaria, Germany. The factory has an annual production capacity of up to 300,000 square meters of solar-driven facade modules.
Its parent, the Grenzebach Group, has experience in the production of solar modules, with additional know-how in glass production technology.
“We believe in the potential of our solar-active facades and are counting on organic growth here in Bavaria,” said Hans-Peter Merklein, managing director of Grenzebach Envelon GmbH.

The Envelon facade modules consist of two essential elements: the substructure, which contains the mounting system and the necessary electrical wiring, and the glass module with integrated photovoltaics. The connections are hidden on the back of the module.
The modules meet all building and technical requirements in terms of electrical safety. A company spokesperson told pv magazine that the individual elements are hung in the substructure, which reportedly enables quick deployment and also makes maintenance and replacement of modules easy. In addition, up to 10 different colors are possible for the solar modules.
The patented color technology is located in the front glass of the photovoltaic module. Using invisible solar cells, the technology can also meet high aesthetic and architectural requirements for glass facades, the company claims. The generated solar power can be used directly in the building.

Under the new scheme, which will be managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), businesses, public organizations and community groups will be entitled to maximum rebates of €2,400 per project.
“In 2022 the maximum grant available is €2,400 and it will remain at this level for 2023,” the government said in a statement.
The program will be open to PV systems up to 6 kW in size that operate under the country's net metering scheme, which was introduced in December 2021. The scheme is designed to deploy around 380 MW of solar capacity.
For PV systems ranging in size from 6 kW to 50 kW, the scheme grants a Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff for surplus power injected into the grid. And for 2022, the tariff was set at €0.135/kWh.
“The CEP will be offered at a fixed rate for 15 years and eligible volumes will be capped at 80% of generation capacity, to encourage self-consumption,” the government said in December.
Eligible projects must have a minimum self-consumption rate of 70%. In order to support this high rate, the Irish government has suggested the adoption of smart meters.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/23/iea-pvsp-experts-forecast-high-cost-low-revenue-scenario-for-pv-module-recycling/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ASIA,AUSTRALIA,EUROPE,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2022","IEA PVSP predicts high-cost, low-revenue scenario for solar recycling","A group of researchers and industry experts from across Europe, the Asia Pacific, and the United States have compiled a review of current regulations and industrial policies for the management of end-of-life PV modules.
The IEA PVSP report found that the volume of end-of-life PV modules is still small, but there are appropriate treatment and recycling measures in place in countries and areas with end-of-life regulations.
“However, the current low volumes, limited available recycling technologies, logistics challenges, and undeveloped markets for recovered materials result in a high-cost, low-revenue scenario for PV module recycling globally,” the report said.
The scenario is expected to improve with the implementation of regulations in more countries and investment in R&D for PV recycling.
Around 1.7 million tons of waste volume of end-of-life PV modules are expected by 2030 under the regular loss scenario of a 2016 analysis by PVSP and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), with approximately 60 million tons expected by 2050. If the early loss scenario pans out, there could be 8 million tons of PV waste by 2030, and a total of 78 million tons by 2050.
Focus on Europe
PV module recycling has been mandatory in Europe since 2012 under the Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive. The directive requires all producers of PV modules in the EU market to either operate their own take-back and recycling scheme or join producer compliance schemes. All EU member states have adopted the WEEE into national law. According to Eurostat statistics, 13,951 tons of PV module waste were collected in 12 European countries in 2018.
Germany reportedly collected 7,865 tons of PV modules in 2018, 7,708 tons of which were recovered. Of those, 6,896 tons were recycled and prepared for reuse. The country requires registration and specific end-of-life treatment for all PV modules. Business-to-costumer PV modules are collected without charge for the customers at municipal waste collection points, but business customers require a paid take-back/collection service, administered by specialized service providers.
Monocrystalline silicon modules are mostly recycled by glass recycling companies, and First Solar operates a specific recycling line for thin-film cadmium telluride (CdTe) PV panels in Frankfurt. According to IEA/PVPS, there will be around 400 thousand tons to 1 million tons of PV waste by 2030 in Germany, with this figure increasing to 4.3 million tons in 2050.
France reportedly collected 4,905 tons of PV waste in 2019, thirteen times as much as in 2015, when the figure stood at 366 tons. Soren, a nonprofit eco-organization, has a monopoly on PV module waste management in the country, managing both its collection and recycling through private tenders, according to the report. In February 2021, it launched a new tender for three new PV recycling facilities in France. One started operations in 2021, and the other two will start in 2022, according to the report. France may see 43 thousand tons of PV waste by 2030, and more than 118 thousand tons by 2040.
Spain reportedly collected 226 tons of PV waste in 2019. Its treatment of waste is still in a “very preliminary stage,” according to the report. Producers are obliged to adopt the necessary actions to manage waste according to product design, and must bear the cost of the process, as well as register the products in the national producer registry of electrical and electronic equipment (RII_AEE). Spain still sees small amounts of PV waste, but these are expected to increase in the medium term, as its first plants near end of life.
Italy reportedly collected 1,350 tons of PV modules in 2018. The Italian energy services manager, GSE, defines instructions for the disposal of modules installed in plants benefiting from feed-in-tariff schemes. End-of-life modules from plants with less than 10 kW nominal power are sent to a national collection center, whereas modules with more than 10 kW are destined to an authorized waste management entity. Italy may see between 140 thousand to 500 thousand tons of PV waste by 2030, with an increase up to 2.2. million tons by 2050.
North America
Various US states have introduced regulations to incentivize the expansion of PV module recycling industrial capacity. Washington was reportedly the first state to introduce a regulation for take-back requirements for PV manufacturers at no additional cost for the PV system owners. California implemented regulations to classify end-of-life PV modules are universal waste at the beginning of 2021, to decrease costs and thereby incentivize a domestic PV recycling industry. North Carolina is considering following suit. PV waste management policies are also being considered in Illinois, Hawaii, Arizona, North Carolina, and New Jersey.
“Despite the regulatory developments at the state level, there is no US federal regulations specifically designed to regulate PV waste management. PV waste is regulated by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which does not contain any specific regulatory requirement for PV waste,” said the report.
First Solar, the world’s largest PV recycler, has a recycling capacity of 150 metric tons/day in the US for its thin-film CdTe PV modules, according to the report. The United States has also witnessed an increase in the number of companies dedicated to recycling crystalline silicon PV systems.
“The potential economic and environmental gains from sustainably managing PV waste have motivated the allocation of R&D funds toward accelerating the scaling of startups focusing on recycling silicon PV waste,” the report says. There may be 5.5 to 10 million tons of PV waste in the US by 2050.
Asia-Pacific region
There are currently no nationwide PV recycling schemes in the Asia Pacific, according to the report. China reportedly does not have any specific policies or regulations on PV module recycling, and it also lacks the necessary recycling industrial chain. It recently implemented several PV recycling R&D projects, including the establishment of the China PV Recycling Center in 2022.
In Australia, only the state of Victoria has mandatory regulations on PV module disposal. Victoria passed legislation banning all electronic waste from landfill sites, including PV modules, inverters and batteries.  The country’s Product Stewardship Centre of Excellence is designing a nationwide extended producer responsibility (EPR) scheme for PV systems, which should be implemented by June 2023.
Japan currently includes PV waste under the general regulatory framework for waste management, as it lacks specific regulations for end-of-life PV module recycling. The country has published guidelines for promoting the proper end-of-life treatment of solar panels and is developing research on high-value glass and low-cost recycling.
South Korea also lacks mandatory PV waste recycling policies, but “PV module waste will be included in the list of items affected by EPR regulations, which will be enforced in the PV industry beginning in 2023,” said the report. The country may see 9,665 tons of PV waste in 2023, up to 112,564 tons in 2040, according to predictions from the Korean Environment Institute.

A consortium including three of Korea’s largest conglomerate groups has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Queensland government with a view to building one of Australia’s largest renewable energy hubs near the coal-mining town of Collinsville to unlock the state’s hydrogen potential and establish a green energy export corridor, connecting northern Queensland to Korea.
The Han-Ho Hydrogen consortium, which comprises Australian-based Ark Energy and its parent company Korea Zinc, as well as petrochemicals group Hanwha Impact and fellow Korean conglomerate SK Gas, are seeking to produce and export more than 1 million tonnes of green ammonia a year to Korea to meet forecast demand as the north Asian nation seeks to meet its climate commitments.
At the heart of the consortium’s plans will be the development of Ark Energy’s Collinsville Green Energy Hub, about 90 km south-west of Bowen, which will have the potential to generate up to 3,000 MW via a mix of wind and solar.
Renewable energy would be used to power electrolyzers to produce green hydrogen, which would then be converted to ammonia for export to Korea. The project is forecast to produce and export more than 1 million tonnes of green ammonia a year from Australia to Korea by 2032.
Ark Energy chief executive officer Daniel Kim said the project has already signed up 12 landholders in the Collinsville area for the renewables hub but he acknowledged there remained “challenges ahead”.
“The scale of what we’re embarking upon doesn’t exist today,” he said. “The shared vision of this consortium is to transform the bilateral relationship between Australia and Korea from one that has been underpinned by resources and fossil fuels to renewable energy and green hydrogen.”
Korea, which has committed to net zero by 2050, is already the third largest importer of ammonia in the world and the Korea Institute of Economic energy research estimates the nation’s total demand for ammonia will exceed 21 million tonnes by 2030.
Most of the green ammonia to be produced by the Collinsville Green Energy Hub is expected to be absorbed by the consortium members. “Our partners and our parent company are major players in Korea’s hydrogen economy and have a forecast demand for more than 2 million tonnes of green ammonia per annum from 2030,” Kim said.
The consortium aims to make a final investment decision in 2027 or 2028, with construction expected to take about four years, Kim said. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the signing of the MOU is another step forward in the state’s quest to be a hydrogen powerhouse.
“We welcome this major new consortium to Queensland, to accelerate progress in our green hydrogen industry and advance green energy exports to Korea,” she said. “What you’ll be seeing over the coming decade is large renewable precincts developing in regional Queensland, that is an indisputable fact.”
The announcement of the proposed 3 GW Collinsville Green Energy Hub is the latest move from Ark Energy which has quickly established itself since its launch in January 2021.
Earlier this year, Ark Energy completed its purchase of Sydney-based renewable energy developer Epuron Holdings in a deal that gives it access to a potential 9 GW pipeline of utility scale wind and solar PV projects.
The buyout of Eporon followed the acquisition of a 30% stake in Acciona Energy’s 923 MW MacIntryre Wind Farm in Queensland which is scheduled to be fully operational by 2024.
Ark Energy is also pursuing plans to develop a renewable hydrogen facility at parent company Korea Zinc’s Sun Metals zinc refinery in Townsville. The SunHQ hydrogen hub, which will be equipped with a 1 MW electrolyzer, is expected to produce about 158 tonnes of green hydrogen per annum, powered by renewable energy from the 124 MW Sun Metals Solar Farm located next to the refinery.

In August President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate and energy package in the history of the United States. Included in the IRA is over $60 billion for domestic manufacturing across the clean energy supply chain, which includes $30 billion in production tax credits to accelerate domestic manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and critical minerals processing. A month later and battery manufacturers are clamoring to set up shop in the United States to take advantage of the financial incentives and to be a part of the clean energy transition.
Panasonic
Panasonic, which makes batteries for electric vehicles, was already manufacturing in the US at a Nevada gigafactory operated in conjunction with Tesla. Now it plans to expand a new facility in Kansas and open yet another facility in Oklahoma. When complete, the Kansas plant would be the largest economic development in the state’s history and would be larger than the Nevada gigafactory.
Panasonic’s factories are expected to produce the company’s lithium-ion 4680 cells for the batteries that go in EVs such as Teslas. Demand for EVs is expected to pick up, also as the result of the IRA, as it includes a $4,000 consumer tax credit for low- to-middle income individuals to buy used clean vehicles, and up to $7500 for new clean vehicles, which includes electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. EV sales will also be boosted by the passage of state bans on gas-powered vehicles—with California leading the way with a ban on sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035. Other states, including Washington, New York and Massachusetts may follow suit.
GM and LG
GM and LG recently announced a joint venture to build EV battery manufacturing plants in Tennessee, Ohio and Michigan. Announced prior to the signing of the IRA, the joint venture, called Ultium Cells LLC, announced that it received a $2.5 billion loan from the U.S. Energy Department to help finance construction of the new plants. The loan comes from the government’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan program, which has $17.7 billion in loan authority to support the manufacture of eligible light-duty vehicles and qualifying components, authorized by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.
GM and LG are investing more than $7 billion via the venture to build three battery plants, according to a Reuters article. The Warren, Ohio plant is currently employing 700 workers and is planned to begin production next month. The Tennessee plant will start production in late 2023 and the Michigan plant in 2024, according to the Reuters report.
Toyota
Just as Toyota announced its target of 40% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electrified vehicles by 2025, which increases to 70% by 2030, it announced an additional investment of $2.5 billion in its newest North American facility, Toyota Battery Manufacturing in North Carolina. The expanded manufacturing facility will not only provide the batteries for its EVs, but will add 350 jobs, bringing the total employment to approximately 2,100. Production is expected to begin in 2025. With the new investment in its North Carolina battery manufacturing facility, the total commitment to advancing its battery production is now $5.6 billion.
Zinc8
Canadian battery developer, Zinc8, is not a well-known brand in the United States, but the company plans to bring battery manufacturing to New York state, incentivized by manufacturing production credits within the Inflation Reduction Act. The inaugural facility is planned for Ulster County, which it will produce batteries based on its proprietary flow battery technology for long-duration energy storage. Zinc8 claims that it is able to deliver power in the range from 20 kW to 50 MW that can store and discharge energy durations from 4 to 100 hours. Scalability and higher capacity is achieved with an increase in the size of storage tanks that hold zinc particles. The intended use is for microgrids and utilities, as well as for commercial and industrial projects.
The company chose Ulster County in Upstate New York after Senator Chuck Schumer personally called the CEO of Zinc8, Ron MacDonald, to urge the company to expand their operations in New York state and particularly to Ulster County.
“Zinc8 is the jolt of electricity the Hudson Valley needs, and is proof positive that when you invest in fighting climate change you are investing in creating good-paying jobs, new economic growth, and a brighter future for our communities. As the EPA officially begins cleanup of this once-contaminated asbestos dumping ground, I can think of no better way to usher in a renaissance for Ulster County than by making this the foundation for supercharging the fight against climate change with an investment in clean tech manufacturing,” said Senator Schumer.
SuperBase
The SuperBase battery is manufactured by U.S. startup, Zendure. It’s a plug-and-play residential storage system with semi-solid-state batteries designed for household backup power, mobile living, and portable EV charging applications.
The SuperBase V 6400 (SBV) measures 29 inches by 14 inches by 17.4 inches, including its real wheels, and weighs 130 pounds. The semi-solid state Satellite battery B6400 measures 27 inches by 11.22 inches by 11 inches and weighs 101 pounds. One SBV unit has a storage capacity of 6.438 kWh and can be scaled with up to four battery modules, reaching a capacity of 32 kWh. Two SBV units can be chained together to reach up to 64 kWh capacity. The energy storage system can operate at temperatures ranging from -20 C to 45 C and has a 3,000-cycle life.
The battery pack, according to the manufacturer, contains 42% more energy than lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries. The company is launching versions of the system for the U.S. and European markets, with different inputs and outputs. The U.S. version has a maximum 1,800 W output at 120V, and of 3,800 W at 240V.
Ion Storage Systems
Another U.S.-based startup, Ion Storage Systems, raised $30 million in venture capital funding, which will go toward scaling up its solid-state battery cell production facility in Maryland, with aims to produce 10 MWh per year by the end of 2023. The funding came from Toyota Ventures, Tenaska, and Bangchak Corp.
The key differences from other solid-state and next-generation batteries are its bi-layer cell design, which the company says reduces typical lithium-ion battery defects, and works with existing and next-generation cathode chemistries, avoiding the use of critical raw materials like cobalt, nickel, and gold.
Neil Ovadia, Ion’s vice-president of operations, told pv magazine that the company can target multiple markets, ranging from defense to consumer products to electric vehicles and stationary grid storage. Ovadia noted that Ion is working on a variation to the core product meant for stationary storage applications.
