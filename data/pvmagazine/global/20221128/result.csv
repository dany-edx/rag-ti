They claim it is the largest grid-connected BESS in Europe.
The Pillswood project uses Tesla’s 2-hour Megapack systems with the capacity to store up to 106 MWh of electricity in a single cycle. It will provide balancing services to the British grid, enabling the integration of renewable power.
The project is near Hull, East Yorkshire, next to the Creyke Beck substation, which will act as a grid- connection point for two phases of the world’s largest offshore wind farm, Dogger Bank.
Tesla built the project and will operate it through Autobidder, its algorithmic trading platform. Pillwood was originally supposed to be switched on over two phases in December 2022 and March 2023, but construction was accelerated to enable both phases to start operations in November.
“All stakeholders have recognized the importance of achieving energization for this project ahead of winter to ensure the BESS services can be provided during the initial winter months,” said Harmony Energy’s director Peter Kavanagh.
The company has five other BESS projects under construction, which it expects to switch on within the next year.

They studied the effects of five factors on the heat dissipation of the EV battery module, including the battery discharge rate, inlet temperature of cooling liquid, nanofluids, airflow velocity, liquid, and air flow directions. The results showed that the maximum temperature and temperature difference of the battery module under a 1 C discharge rate could be reduced by 1.1 C and 0.92 C compared to the single liquid cooling. Comparing the LCP-AFC with single air cooling, the maximum temperature and temperature difference of the battery module under a 4 C discharge rate could be reduced by 18.74 C and 2.71 C. The temperature uniformity of the battery module was not satisfied with the inlet temperature of the cooling liquid, which was lower than 15 C. The heat transfer performance was improved by adding Al, Cu, or Ag nanoparticles into the deionized water. Among them, Ag–water nanofluid had the most significant cooling effect. Parallel flow indicated better thermal performance than cross flow and counter flow. The researchers described the system in Energy Science and Engineering.
SK is developing a battery diagnosis service for electric vehicles, with plans to add it to its own charging stations next year. It is developing the new service with its battery unit, SK On, and its charger subsidiary, SK Signet. SK On's battery-as-a-service (BaaS) will analyze data from SK Signet's rapid chargers, and measure battery life and condition in real time when users plug in. They said 50 kW chargers will 30 minutes to diagnose, and the faster the charging speed, the shorter the time. The results will displayed through the charger screen and a planned app.
Xelectrix Power and Mobilespace have agreed to jointly develop a mobile power storage device with an integrated automatic transfer switch (ATS), for on- and off-grid charging. The 80 kW Ecobaze system has a capacity of 160 kWh – enough to cover all of the energy needs of a typical movie set – and can be charged with a PV system or from the grid. The generator can fully charge the storage system within 1.5 to two hours, with an output of up to 100 KW whenever storage reaches its minimum state of charge (SoC). The system can supply basis demand (60 kWh to 120 kWh) for between one to three days without the need to turn on the diesel generator, and can supply loads up to 80 kW. The generator only turns on if the SoC reaches its minimum, or if the load is higher than the rated power of the 80 kW storage system inverter. The storage system and generator can together supply loads up to 180 kW.
BMW Group plans to build assembly lines for the high-voltage batteries next to its new vehicle plant in Debrecen, Hungary. Production of the battery packs is expected to begin in parallel with vehicle production by the end of 2025. The Munich-based carmaker is investing more than €2 billion ($2.08 billion) in the plant, where it will make its sixth-generation batteries, as it switches from prismatic to round cells in its New Class vehicles. It will build the new batteries according to the “pack-to-open-body concept” for a system voltage of 800 V.
Mazda has unveiled a $10.6 billion plan to electrify its fleet of vehicles. The Japanese carmaker said it also might invest in battery production. “We estimate Mazda's EV ratio in global sales to rise to a range between 25% and 40% as of 2030,” the company said in a statement, noting that it is working with partner companies on a range of electrification-related research projects. One of them, in partnership with Rohm and Imasen Electric Industrial, focuses on the development of inverters with silicon-carbide power semiconductors – one of the core parts of an electric drive unit. Imasen is also involved in a separate 50:50 collaboration with Mazda to develop inverters and production tech for components such as circuit boards.
VinFast has shipped its first batch of EVs. The Vietnamese carmaker is exporting 999 units of its VF 8 model to the United States. The shipment is the first batch of 65,000 global orders already made for the VF 8 and VF 9, according to the company. More VF 8 SUVs will be exported to Canada and Europe in early 2023. VinFast is also building an EV plant in North Carolina, pending final regulatory approval.
ABB has raised around CHF 200 million ($211.5 million) from the sale of an 8% stake in its EV charging business. It will retain 92% of E-mobility, as it aims to list its shares in the second half of 2023. The list of buyers includes investors linked to IKEA and AMAG, and proceeds from the stake sale will be used to expand E-mobility and make hardware and software acquisitions, said ABB.
Batri and its international consortium partners are working on a renewable energy transport hub in Swansea, Wales. The group includes DST Innovations, Siemens, construction giant HDR, and infrastructure specialist Enable. The hub will feature electric and hydrogen charging facilities for cars, public transport vehicles, e-bikes, and e-scooters, as part of a larger scheme to reinvent Swansea's dock area. The plans includes a tidal lagoon, a data center, a battery factory, green hydrogen production, floating solar panels, and a battery storage facility for the renewable energy generated on site.  Other elements of the scheme include affordable homes and a climate change research center. Subject to planning consent, work is scheduled to start on the project in 2023.

Spanish tracker manufacturer Soltec and Enel Green Power España, the Spanish subsidiary of Italy's Enel Green Power (EGP), have announced plans to jointly build a solar tracker factory in the warehouses and facilities of a decommissioned thermal power plant in Teruel, in the province of Aragón, eastern Spain..
The thermal power plant is owned by Spanish energy supplier Endesa, which is a unit of EGP's parent company, Enel.
“It will allow us to supply solar tracker suppliers to the Andorra project,” said Soltec CEO Raúl Morales. “Within the existing macroeconomic and geopolitical context, it is more necessary than ever to locate production centers within the European Union. Developing our production center near project sites is a decision aligned with our strategy of circular economy and socio-economic excellence.”
Enel is also working with Italian engineering specialist Comal to set up a solar tracker factory in Montalto di Castro, in the province of Viterbo, central Italy. The Tracker Sun Hunter factory will be cover more than 30,000 square meters at the Montalto di Castro power plant, which is owned by Enel, but is no longer used for energy generation.

The country added 54.5 MW of solar in 2021, according to official figures published by the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE).
“This almost threefold increase in 2022 is mainly because of the increasing electricity prices and also the fact that there were several large solar systems that were installed in 2021, but which were not put into operation until after the New Year,” Ali Arfa, data manager at EUPD Research, told pv magazine.
Arfa noted that rising PV system efficiency, growing social acceptance of solar, and regulatory changes for new zero-emissions buildings will also contribute to the full-year total. EUPD Research expects the large-scale solar market to install 61 MW in 2022, followed by the commercial segment with 48 MW, and the residential sector with 36.4 MW. The research firm categorizes installations above 500 kW in size as “large scale,” arrays between 10 kW and 500 kW as “commercial,” and up to 10 kW as “residential.”
NVE and the Norwegian energy industry's common data hub, Elhub, use different criteria. According to ElHub, 102 MW of capacity had been installed in Norway by the end of September. PV systems on single-family homes contributed 30 MW, ground-mounted systems accounted for just 1 MW, and PV systems on commercial buildings came in at 71 MW.
“The estimation is that toward the rest of the year, another 40 MW to 50 MW of PV will be commissioned,” said Arfa.
With this year's new additions, Norway's cumulative solar capacity is set to reach 354.5 MW by the end of December. Between 2023 and 2026, the country could add 285 MW of residential capacity, 360 MW of commercial arrays, and 640 MW of large-scale projects, according to EUPD Research. The country could potentially reach 1.6 GW of cumulative PV capacity by the end of 2026 and add 500 MW of capacity every year thereafter until 2030, to hit 3.6 GW by the end of the decade.

Green Gravity and international engineering heavyweight GHD have signed a memorandum of understanding to develop new applications for the startup’s storage solution, which moves heavy weights vertically in legacy mine shafts to capture and release the gravitational potential energy, providing long-duration storage to the grid.
In a wide-ranging partnership, Australian-based Green Gravity and GHD will collaborate on technical engineering, policy, regulatory matters and electricity grid connectivity practices.
Green Gravity Chief Executive Mark Swinnerton said the partnership marked the next crucial stage in the commercialization of the company’s “home-grown” gravitational energy storage technology.
“Recent escalating power prices declared in the federal budget demonstrate how important it is for innovative Australian companies to commercialize new technology quickly,” he said. “Solving the power pricing challenge requires collaboration across sectors, innovation, and determination. We are up for the challenge.”
Green Gravity's technology harnesses the fundamental principles of gravity and kinetic energy to store and dispatch energy by lifting and lowering ultra-heavy weights in legacy mine shafts. As the weights are lowered, the cable holding the weights passes through a device called a ‘winder’, which then turns a motor.
The company aims to raise the weights when excess renewable energy is available and lower the weights to satisfy demand; either for industrial purposes or simply because prices in the electricity grid make it an attractive time to dispatch.
The concept is similar to other gravity energy storage technologies, but Swinnerton believes the use of old mine shafts, rather than purpose-built tall towers, will be his competitive advantage.
“Green Gravity’s energy storage technology represents a breakthrough in the search for economic long-duration storage of renewable energy,” he said. “By re-using mining assets, costs can be kept low. By using gravity as the fuel, we dispense with consuming the critical water, land, and chemicals which other storage technologies rely on.”
The signing of the agreement with GHD follows the announcement that Green Gravity will work with Australian coal producer Yancoal to explore the potential application of its energy storage technology at the Austar coal mine site in the Australian state of New South Wales.
Austar has been idle for more than two years and Swinnerton said decommissioned ventilation shafts that connect the underground mine to the surface look like a prospective place for Green Gravity to deploy its technology.
The deal with Yancoal will see the two companies work together on a feasibility study for the installation of Green Gravity’s equipment at the site, potentially paving the way for widespread application of the technology.
Swinnerton said the study was a great opportunity not just for Green Gravity to prove its technology's value, but also for legacy mine sites to show their continuing worth. “Successfully identifying the best method of fitting gravitational technology at the former Austar mine site will create a template for beneficial reuse of legacy mining sites for Yancoal, and for thousands of other mines around the country.”
Yancoal Australia Chief Executive David Moult said the study will also assess how gravitational energy storage assists in delivering beneficial post-mining land use.
“An important element of the project will be to show how renewable energy projects can play a potential role in beneficial post-mining land use,” he said.

“There are two previous reports on using kusachiite as a light harvester,” researcher Vishesh Manjunath told pv magazine. “In the first report, CuBi2O4 is sensitized over photoanodes to fabricate dye-sensitized solar cells, and the in the second report, CuBi2O4 light harvester is modeled with a complex device architecture. However, for the first time, we have modeled the kusachiite solar cells akin to the simpler perovskite solar cell device architecture.”
He said the cost of kusachiite solar cells could be much lower than that of conventional crystalline silicon cells, owing to the well-established synthesis protocols of CuBi2O4.
“The synthesis of various nanostructures of CuBi2O4 is well-established,” he said. “However, synthesizing thin films of CuBi2O4 with low defect density should be experimented with, and the best and most cost-effective process can be scaled up for manufacturing kusachiite solar cells.”
The researchers designed the cell with a substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass, different types of buffer layers, a CuBi2O4 absorber, and a metal contact based on gold (Au). Through a series of simulations, they evaluated this design for variation in thickness, accepter/donor defect, and doping density of subsequent thin-films, counter electrodes, and operating temperature. 
“An increase in the thickness of CBO absorber film beyond the charge diffusion length will lead to charge recombination resulting in low short-circuit current density (JSC), subsequently restraining the power conversion efficiency,” the scientists explained. “Importantly, the CuBi2O4 thin films deposited by spin-coating and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) showed a carrier diffusion length of around 50 nm. Moreover, the thickness of the absorber layer controls the carrier absorption of short-wavelength photons and considerably reduces the electrical losses associated with charge carrier recombination at the interface.”
In the proposed cell configuration, blue light and other high-energy light are absorbed at the interface, while low-energy light like red light is absorbed when the thickness of the absorber is on the higher side. For this reason, the thickness of CuBi2O4 absorber films should be properly optimized to achieve maximum efficiency, said the research group. 
They found that the highest efficiency of 27.7% was achieved with a cell design featuring a buffer layer made of tin sulfide (SnS2). Another device with a tungsten disulfide (WS2) buffer layer – as well as an optimized CuBi2O4 light absorber with a thickness of 900 nm and an acceptor doping density of 2 cm × 1,018 cm – achieved an efficiency of 22.84%.
The scientists presented the solar cell design in “Futuristic kusachiite solar cells of CuBi2O4 absorber and metal sulfide buffer Layers: Theoretical efficiency approaching 28%,” which was recently published in Solar Energy.
“Overall, the methodology and approach provided here to scrutinize environmentally friendly, cost-effective, easy to manufacture, and packaging visible light absorber and metal sulfide buffer layers can be extended to other optoelectronic devices,” the researchers concluded.

India installed 3,338 MW of new solar power capacity in the third quarter of 2022, bringing cumulative PV installations to 64.2 GW by the end of September. Of the new additions, 2.6 GW came from utility-scale solar, 485 MW from the rooftop, and 251 MW from off-grid installations, according to Bridge to India’s latest report.
Capacity installations declined 13% quarter on quarter in the July-September period, as developers postponed projects in anticipation of a decline in module prices next year. A lack of clarity about the concessional basic customs duty (BCD) for projects auctioned before March 2021 also slowed progress, said the analysts.
“Prices of both international and domestic modules softened slightly and are expected to continue easing gradually through all of 2023. EPC cost for utility-scale solar saw a 7% QOQ decline to INR 43.3 ($0.53)/Wp,” said Bridge to India.
Module imports picked up marginally throughout the quarter, but exports also grew to an all-time high. The total amount of PV in the national pipeline stood at 53,405 MW as of Sept. 30. This includes projects allocated to developers and installations in various stages of development. Bridge to India said it expects the country to add about 3.2 GW of PV capacity in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 3 GW in the first quarter of 2023.

However, the authorities have yet to decide whether the obligation will require fossil fuel heat producers to introduce their own quotas for renewables, or force them to comply with a minimum percentage mandated by the state.
“The department is not currently in a position to confirm specific aspects of the scheme regarding mandatory obligations and renewable quotas, as these details are yet to be finalized,” a spokesperson for Ireland's Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications told pv magazine.
In 2021, renewable energy supplied power for 6.8% of Ireland’s heat sector, compared to a European Union average of 22%, according to a statement by the Irish government.
“The obligation will further incentivize suppliers of all fuels in the heat sector to ensure that a certain proportion of the energy supplied is renewable,” said the department.
The government has already started developing different options to structure the scheme. It expects to hold a technical consultation about the final design of the scheme in the first quarter of 2023.
“This process will include examination of proposed obligation rates, scalability, and costs to the consumer,” it said.
Electricity plays a key role in all of the scenarios proposed by the National Heat Study, which was recently published by SEAI. The analysis shows that heat pumps will supply 12% to 20% of heating demand in 2030 and 33% to 38% in 2050. The model considers the use of solar in combination with air source heat pumps. Solar thermal is seen as a supplement to hydrogen and biomethane boilers.
The next print edition of pv magazine – due out on December 6 – will visit Ukraine to examine the extent of damage caused to the nation’s energy infrastructure, including its solar plants, and we will include coverage of how PV has been affected in the newly-liberated region of Kherson.
Heat pumps are considered technically suitable for 78% of existing residential buildings, 66% of commercial buildings, and 47% of public buildings, assuming that they do not undergo energy efficiency improvements. If they do, the rates increase to 82%, 97%, and 98%, respectively.

The semitransparent Mirai Screen module – or “PV shade screen,” as the company calls it – features monocrystalline silicon solar cells. It is suitable for deployment on greenhouses to generate energy and protect the plants from excessive sunlight.
The PV shade screens are specifically designed for locations with high solar radiation levels, where greenhouses are used for energy-intensive controlled environment agriculture (CEA).
“The performance depends on the shadowing level, which is customizable according to our client’s needs, and therefore the number of cells in the module,” said CEO Michael Salvador. “The advantage of the Mirai Screen is the retraction mechanism, which allows controlling the light availability for the plants – as in a conventional shade screen – coupled with the flexibility of using various types of crystalline silicon solar cells with high efficiency and stability. This grants our product advantages in performance and cost when compared with other PV technologies in this field.”
The proprietary screen design features a standard building block that is replicated over arbitrary areas to cover either all or part of the greenhouse area.
“This is important as greenhouse designs are not fully standardized,” Salvador told pv magazine. “The output power depends on the fraction of light transmission. We typically use solar cells with efficiencies over 22%.”
A 60% shading module has a nominal power of more than 100 W per square meter. The voltage of the screen depends on the size of the screen, which is a function of the greenhouse design. The voltage is typically around 25 V per building block and 300 V per screen section.
“Our screen was designed with a strong focus on reducing the weight of the module,” said Michele De Bastiani, director of R&D. “The glass-free design enables weight ranges below 1.5 kg per m2, which allows for its deployment inside the greenhouse using the same infrastructure as conventional shade screens. This also protects the PV from the environment, in particular soiling and hot temperatures, which are very common in desert regions.”
A typical installation does not feature heavy steel structures, but the company claims that this enables a simplified installation mechanism.
“The installation mechanism was co-developed with the German shade screen specialist Novavert,” said De Bastiani, noting that Mirai Solar is running multiple pilots in different locations and plans to introduce a turnkey system in the fourth quarter of 2023.
The company also holds intellectual property related to the optical properties and light management capabilities of the screen.
“The regions of the screen that are not involved in the electricity production are tailored for optimized light transmission and diffusion with a proprietary technology to avoid shadowing casted from the opaque cells,” said De Bastiani. “We are now planning to increase our production capacity.”
Mirai Solar manufactured the modules in Saudi Arabia, with the support of KAUST.
“Since we do not use glass or a metal frame and have a reduced [balance of system], our PV screens will be more cost effective than conventional PV technology with the scaling of the manufacturing process,” said De Bastiani. “The [levelized cost of electricity] depends on the geographic region and the level of insolation. We target locations with [levelized cost of electricity] of $0.03/kWh to $0.05/kWh.”
The company built three pilots in greenhouses in different regions.
“So far, the conclusion is that the biomass is on par with conventional shade screens,” said De Bastiani. “The economic benefit stems from optimizing energy and crop yield using our retraction technology.”
