The first product to emerge from the collaboration between the UK manufacturer and EO Charging is a compact, 7 kW wall-mounted socketed charging unit with built-in solar-matching functionality. With Clearline EV in the product line-up alongside its roof-integrated solar panels, Viridian says it aims to help homebuilders with the technologies they need for compliance with new UK building regulations. Clearline EV will be available from January 2023.
The New York City Council is mulling new rules covering the charging, use and sale of electric bikes and scooters, following a Nov. 5 high-rise battery fire in Manhattan that injured 46 civilians, firefighters and police officers. The blaze was sparked by a faulty e-bike battery that was left to charge unattended by residents who reportedly ran a repair shop from their home, which may explain why five e-bikes were found. In a meeting last week, the council discussed a range of proposals, including public education campaigns, safety reports, a ban on the sale of manipulated and configured batteries, and restrictions on batteries that have not been approved by nationally recognized testing labs. The city has seen “an exponential increase” in fires related to faulty lithium-ion batteries in recent years, with nearly 200 blazes and six fire-related deaths this year. The council hearing was held as New Yorkers staged a rally to call for more regulation. “We want a battery swap network, want batteries to be certified,” said Lenny Feliu, co-founder of the group Safer Charging.
Honda has acquired certification to run a virtual power plant in Germany. In a pilot with VPP operator Next Kraftwerke, the Japanese company became the first automaker in Europe to obtain certification for a fleet of mass-produced EVs, for the prequalification of frequency containment reserve (FCR) by Ampiron GmbH in Germany. The pilot used Honda EVs, which qualified for grid-stability support through the instant provision of FCR to the transmission system operator (TSO). Honda was able to ensure stable 50 Hz grid frequency, in line with charging and discharging requirements, with a fleet of six EVs and six Honda Power Manager bidirectional CCS chargers. Its power management system used real-time capacity data from Next Kraftwerke to respond to the TSO's charging and discharging commands for each individual vehicle. “EVs are parked and connected to a charging station for most of the day,” said Tom Gardner, senior vice president of Honda Motor Europe. “Honda has identified that these standing times can be better utilized to offer additional services and revenues, through smart charging and discharging based on the current power grid frequency.”
Bosch has joined forces with IBM to use quantum computing to conduct research on electromobility materials. They want to develop powerful quantum algorithms for industrial applications to achieve higher energy efficiency and reduce the consumption of resources. “Even simple models of real materials tend to quickly become intractable for classical computers to simulate. That’s why Bosch’s collaboration with IBM, as well as the extended IBM Quantum Network on quantum computing research, is so important,” said Scott Crowder, IBM's vice president of quantum adoption. “We will work together on addressing a wide range of materials science problems, in the fields of electromobility, renewable energy and sensor technology.” The announcement follows Volkswagen's launch of a multi-year research program with Canada's Xanadu to improve the performance of quantum algorithms for battery material simulations.
Sono Motors has partnered with Pepper Motion to test solar retrofit solutions for e-buses. The German developer of solar electric cars has equipped a Mercedes-Benz Citaro from Pepper’s demo fleet with a customized version of its Solar Bus Kit, which contains 14 semi-flexible solar modules to provide around 1.3 kW peak to the 24-volt battery system. Energy generation is expected to hit 3.3 kWh/day, based on average weather conditions in Munich. The companies will assess energy yield figures and consumption data over a two-year period from December, with initial findings from field testing and data analysis not expected until the first quarter of 2023 at the earliest.
VinES and Gotion High-Tech have broken ground on a 5 GWh LFP battery cell factory in Vietnam. The VND 6,329 billion ($275 million) facility in Ha Tinh province will focus on manufacturing battery cells for ESS products developed by VinES and VinFast's EVs. They said they will begin mass production in the third quarter of 2024.
The state of California has announced $3.6 billion in funding for zero-emission vehicles and chargers. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has approved a $2.6 billion investment plan to support a wide range of ZEV projects, with 70% of the funds directed to disadvantaged and low-income communities. The supported projects range from incentives for cleaner trucks and buses, and mobility options such as bike- and car-sharing, to consumer rebates for clean cars. In addition,  the California Public Utilities Commission has adopted a five-year, state-wide, $1 billion transport electrification program. The program will allocate 70% of the funding for medium- and heavy-duty vehicle charging, with the balance for light-duty charging at or near multi-unit dwellings. The program offers rebates for behind-the-meter EV infrastructure investments at commercial, industrial and residential sites from 2025 and provides higher rebates for projects in underserved, disadvantaged, and tribal communities.

The tool highlights the highest confirmed conversion efficiencies of research cells for a range of PV technologies.
With the new interactive version, users can pull up decades of research data and compare custom charts that focus on specific technologies or time periods, NREL said in a statement. They can now find data on a cell’s current, voltage output, and fill factor, in addition to efficiency. The availability of those details will depend on the information in NREL’s records.
The highest research cell efficiency recorded in the chart is 47.1%, for a four-junction cell. Its interactive nature allows users to visualize the recent jump in conversion efficiencies for emerging technologies like perovskite solar cells. That contrasts with the steady improvement of silicon solar cell efficiency since the 1980s.

“It’s possible that the NREL efficiency chart is the most presented graph that you can find at the annual PV Specialists Conference and similar conferences,” said Sarah Kurtz, senior research fellow at NREL. “But it has gotten so full that it’s difficult to see the data. With the new interactive chart, researchers will be able to still use the data, but present it in a way that communicates better for their talk.”
The cell efficiencies are measured by independent testing centers, including NREL, before earning a spot on the chart. All of the figures are also available as a downloadable file.

The facility is located on an artificial rainwater retention reservoir in the Pomeranian Investment Center industrial park. It is one of Poland’s first floating solar projects.
The installation features 110 bifacial modules from an undisclosed manufacturer, with a total capacity of 49.5 kW. It uses Isigenere’s floating platform technology. According to local media reports, this is Poland’s first floating solar installation to use a floating platform from a European manufacturer.
The Gdańsk Economic Development Agency funded the pilot project.
“The investment is of a pilot nature, which will allow to evaluate this technology before a potential decision to extend the solution to our investment areas,” said Maciej Cieślik, a member of the agency’s advisory board.
Polish floating solar specialist Antamion built the facility. It supplies solar energy to a nearby office building complex. Another floating solar project in Poland started operations in November 2021, built by China-based Mibet Energy.

BlackRock-owned Akaysha Energy is now developing the 1.9 GWh Waratah Super Battery Project north of Sydney.
The company was contracted to deliver a battery with a guaranteed continuous power capacity of at least 700 MW and a guaranteed useable energy storage capacity of at least 1,400 MWh. Powin has now announced that it will supply 909 MW of power equipment and 1,915 MWh of annual storage capacity.
Powin will provide 2,592 units of its modular Centipede BESS platform. Its EKS Energy subsidiary will deliver 288 power conversion systems. Construction is expected to start in 2023, with a targeted completion date in the middle of 2025. The BESS is expected to act as a “shock absorber” for Australia’s electricity grid, as part of a system integrity protection scheme (SIPS).
“This flagship SIPS project will unlock latent transfer capacity in the existing transmission system, help integrate renewable energy, and maintain grid reliability by acting as a ‘shock absorber’ if disruptions such as lightning strikes or bushfires interrupt the flow of electricity,” Powin said in a statement. “The proposed WSB Project will ensure Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong have access to more energy from existing generators while reducing the risk of power disruptions.”
Akaysha Energy won a bid to deliver the energy storage project in October. It will be built on the former grounds of the 1,400 MW Munmorah coal-fired power station.

Germany's Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research Baden-Württemberg (ZSW) has developed a 21.1%-efficient tandem solar module based on perovskite and copper, indium, gallium and selenium (CIGS) thin-film technology.
The module measures 9 square centimeters and is characterized by an industrially suitable and scalable component architecture, according to its creators. The current best values for tandem solar modules made of perovskite and CIGS would only be slightly higher, at 22%. With smaller laboratory cells, ZSW has already achieved an efficiency of 26.6% for this material combination.
“The main progress that led to the efficiency improvement was made in the semitransparent perovskite top module,” Jan-Philipp Becker, Head of Department Photovoltaics – Materials Research at ZSW, told pv magazine. “First, the defect passivation was improved by employing a thin layer of phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) on top of the multi-cation perovskite absorber. Second, using DC sputtered hydrogen doped indium oxide (IO:H), a high-mobility transparent conductive oxides (TCO) as the transparent contacts and magnesium fluoride (MgF2) anti-reflecting coating, the transparency in the long wavelength range was increased to values well above 85% in the near infra-red (NIR), which results in more light entering the CIGS bottom device.”
The scientists used organometallic perovskites, which are a promising group of materials for tandem solar modules, as they use the high-energy part of the solar spectrum very efficiently in the top solar module, due to their high optical energy bandgap. These compounds also allow a considerable low-energy part of the spectrum to pass into the second bottom solar module below.
“The top perovskite half-module not only has to be highly efficient; it must also be semitransparent to allow enough light to pass through to the bottom module,” the researchers said. “They made several improvements to this end, including developing more transparent electrodes and enhancing the passivation of boundary layers.”
ZSW now wants to scale up and further develop the tandem thin-film technology, in cooperation with undisclosed interested industrial customers.
“Tandem solar cells that pair perovskite with CIGS offer benefits beyond high efficiency,” the research institute said. “This thin-film technology can also be deposited on plastic or steel films to make light, flexible modules that lend themselves to many more use cases. They can be installed the conventional way in solar parks and be seamlessly integrated into vehicles and on factory roofs that cannot handle heavy loads.”

The new rules will allow storage facilities to operate in combination with unlicensed power plants. Such plants will be allowed to increase their wind or solar capacity up to the installed power of the storage facility.
“These capacity increases will be counted within the scope of the renewable energy resources support mechanism (YEKDEM) incentive,” Eren Engur, a Günder board member, told pv magazine. “Lost energy in production and storage facilities will not be counted under the incentive or purchase guarantee.”
Engur said the government will start approving the first projects with energy storage in the middle of 2023. He said the new provisions will support the Turkish PV market, which is growing by at least 1 GW per year.
“We’re successfully harvesting the energy from the sun via photovoltaics for seven to eight hours per day,” he said. “Now it’s time to fulfill the remaining 17 to 18 hours of energy need cycle with different energy storage technologies.”
Turkey has more than 10 GW of cumulative PV capacity, according to new figures from Turkish grid operator TEIAS.

Australian renewables developer Windlab is confident the $106 million Kennedy Energy Park (KEP), which combines 43 MW of wind, 15 MW of solar, and a 2 MW/4 MWh battery, will commence full commercial operations in early 2023 with the project currently progressing through the final testing and commissioning phase.
Windlab Operations General Manager Mark Pickering told pv magazine Australia that KEP, near Hughenden in central north Queensland, is now fully operational and the initial hold-point tests, 10 MW and 25 MW, have been completed with the facility currently authorized to operate at 25 MW, exporting 80% of the energy that the facility is expected to produce at full 50 MW capacity.
“KEP has one further hold point to complete, being HP3 at 50 MW, which is the rated connection capacity,” he said. “We are awaiting the go-ahead from AEMO and Energy Queensland to perform this test. We hope to receive permission before the end of this year,” he said.
The energy park was hailed as Australia’s first project on a major grid to combine wind, solar and battery technologies when it was completed in late 2018, but its commercial operation has been delayed due to complications in the connection process. The plant was eventually energized in August 2019 but didn’t secure its registration from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) until June 2021.
Pickering said the ongoing hold-ups relate to the finalization of the electrical model rather than the design of the plant.
“AEMO and Energy Queensland require a complex set of scenarios to be modeled which has taken longer than expected,” he said.
A 50-50 joint venture between Windlab and Japan-based energy company Eurus Energy, KEP is now expected to commence full commercial operations in early 2023.
The project is underpinned by a 10-year power purchase agreement with Queensland state-owned generator CS Energy which includes 100% of the output of KEP.
The update on KEP comes just days after Windlab announced it would team with Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) to develop the North Queensland Super Hub in the Hughenden region. The goal is to unlock more than 10 GW of wind and solar energy within the next 10 years to support the industrial-scale production of green hydrogen.
Windlab Chief Executive John Martin said the projects are big steps towards the company realising its ambition to deliver 20% of Australia’s new green energy generation over the next 10 years.
“The enormous renewable energy potential of Hughenden and the Flinders Shire means this region is a strategically critical part of our development strategy,” he said.

Tall, windowed skyscrapers loom over many major metropolitan areas. These highly glazed buildings are not particularly efficient, but newly published research in One Earth shows that PV windows can help considerably.
“There are preconceived notions of what an energy-efficient building looks like, and it usually is not highly glazed, and it probably isn’t very tall,” said Lance Wheeler, a scientist at NREL. “We found that there are other ways to build high-efficiency buildings.”
Wheeler developed PVWindow, a new type of open-source software on GitHub, to model the impact of the technology. In a report, he and his colleagues describe the building design rules that could lead to “net-zero” or even “net-positive” energy consumption.
Skyscrapers often have a high ratio of window to wall. For example, the 1915 Equitable Building in New York, has a window-to-wall ratio of 25%. This compares to the Bank of America Tower of 2016, which has a of 71% window-to-wall ratio.
The researchers modeled a window-to-wall ratio of 95% to demonstrate the impact glazing has on building energy performance. They also found that triple-paned windows are highly effective in reducing energy use.
“Picture a skyline in, like, New York City where there are these high-rise buildings that are entirely glass,” said Wheeler. “They’re fully glazed. The Freedom Tower has millions of square feet of glass. It could be a power plant in itself.”
In January, building-integrated PV specialist Ubiquitous Energy announced the closing of a $30 million Series B funding round.

Enel North America affiliate 3Sun USA is now scouring the United States for locations for a new 3 GW bifacial solar module and cell factory, with plans to eventually scale up production to 6 GW per year.
Construction of the proposed facility is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2023, with production anticipated by late 2024.  The facility is expected to create up to 1,500 new full-time jobs.
“Recent policy tailwinds from the Inflation Reduction Act have served as a catalyst for our solar manufacturing ambitions in the US, ushering in a new era of made-in-America energy,” said Enrico Viale, head of Enel North America.
The proposed facility will be Enel’s second global PV manufacturing facility. The company recently announced the expansion of its 3Sun gigafactory in Catania, Sicily, by increasing its production capacity from 200 MW to 3 GW.
At the planned US facility, Enel will produce the same bifacial heterojunction PV modules as it does at its Sicily plant. In February 2020, Enel said that its solar cells had achieved a 24.63% efficiency rating.

The result has been confirmed by Germany’s ISFH.
“We cannot disclose if the cell is n-type or p-type at this stage,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
Martin Green, a professor at the University of New South Wales in Australia and the creator of the “solar cell efficiency tables,” said the result is the highest efficiency record for silicon solar cells to date.
“This outstanding achievement will be included in the next version of efficiency tables published in the progress in photovoltaics,” he said, noting that the previous record of 26.7% was achieved by an unspecified Japanese manufacturer in 2017. Longi likely refers to the result achieved by Japanese chemical company Kaneka. Its 180cm² crystalline silicon device, which featured heterojunction and back-contact technology, achieved 26.63% efficiency.
“Longi broke a new world record for silicon solar cell conversion efficiency with 26.74%, 26.78% and 26.81% respectively, which further affirmed Longi's determination to continuously focus on R&D investment and promote industrial progress,” said the Chinese manufacturer.
In September, the company said it had achieved an efficiency of 26.12% for a gallium-doped, p-type heterojunction (HJT) solar cell based on an M6 wafer. The company also achieved an efficiency of 25.47% for the same solar cell in March.
In addition, the Chinese manufacturer recorded an efficiency of 26.5% for a n-type heterojunction solar cell in June and a 25.19% rating for its p-type TOPCon solar cell in July 2021. In June 2021, it achieved a 25.21% efficiency rating for an n-type TOPCon PV cell.
