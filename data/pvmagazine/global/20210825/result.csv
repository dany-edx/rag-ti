Group14 Technologies, based in Washington state, yesterday announced a link-up with Bratislava-headquartered InoBat which will enable the production of “high-capacity, silicon-based anode” materials which it is claimed offer more energy density than conventional lithium-ion EV batteries.
The U.S. company said it can manufacture 120 tons per year of its proprietary SCC55 anode material in Washington state, although most of the output from its Woodinville fab is currently used for consumer electronics.
The agreement with InoBat follows the announcement Group14 is jointly planning a new production site in South Korea with specialist gas producer SK Materials.
“Our goal is to contribute to the global electrification efforts,” said InoBat co-founder and CEO Marian Bocek, quoted in a press release issued by Group14 yesterday. “Partnering with Group14 will enable us to bring advanced energy solutions across the whole battery value chain for a variety of markets.”
Group14 counterpart Rick Luebbe said: “In order to truly enable the electrification of everything, successful and sustainable EV adoption will hinge on energy storage breakthroughs. With this partnership with InoBat, we are taking a leap to enable automotive OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] to meet and exceed cost parity [versus conventional vehicles], all while delivering unparalleled performance and mitigating carbon emissions on a global scale.”

France's Climate and Resilience Law was officially promulgated and published in the nation's official journal yesterday. It aims in particular to improve the air quality of large cities, support building renovation, promote electric mobility, fight against ground concretization, and integrate more vegetarian menus in canteens. “It is a comprehensive and ambitious text that permanently anchors ecology in our development model,” said Barbara Pompili, minister for the ecological transition, in a press release. “We are now focused on the next step: introducing the secondary legislation to concretely translate the measures of the text into the daily lives of the French.”
Regarding solar photovoltaic energy, several measures could have a direct impact on the development of projects in the years to come. These include a cost reduction for the grid connection of PV systems not exceeding 500 kW in size, and the solarization of new buildings.
According to the text, as of January 1, 2023, new commercial and industrial buildings, as well as warehouses and hangars of more than 500m2 and office buildings of more than 1,000m2, will have to solarize 30% of their surface. As of January 1, 2024, new car parking areas of more than 500m2 will have to solarize 50% of their surface, and 100% if carports are present in the area.
The law also includes streamlining the authorization process for installing solar power plants on wasteland in coastal areas and the possibility of launching calls for tenders for large scale storage and hydrogen projects in metropolitan France.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/25/heat-pump-control-strategy-for-solar-assisted-district-heating/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 25, 2021",Heat pump control strategy for solar assisted district heating,"Researchers from the University of Rovira i Virgili in Spain have evaluated different control strategies for heat pump operation in a solar-assisted district heating system (SDHS) for space heating (SH) and domestic hot water (DHW) with seasonal storage serving a small community of 10 buildings located in Madrid.
According to them, integrating heat pumps into an SDHS may help reduce storage heat loss and stabilize the overall temperature of the thermal network to facilitate low-temperature district heating. The system consists of solar thermal collectors, a seasonal storage tank (SST), a DHW storage tank, a water-to-water heat pump unit, and an auxiliary gas heater.
In this configuration, the heat generated by the heat pump is used to provide heat at around 50 degrees Celsius for SH or supplied to the SST for charging up the heat stored. If the solar thermal installation, the heat pump, and the SST are not able to meet the heat demand, the auxiliary gas heater comes into play. Each building in the complex has 28 apartments with an area of 90 m2 and the estimated total demand for each building is €191.34 MWh per year. The prices of gas and electricity in the area are estimated at €0.0526 and €0.1873 per kWh, respectively.
Two control strategies are proposed for heat pump operation: The Control (A) mode, through which the heat pump works when the mean temperature of the SST is lower than a reference heat pump turn on temperature; and the Control (B) mode, through which the heat pump works if the solar collector temperature is lower than the mean SST temperature. “In these modes of operation, the heat generated by the heat pump in control (A) and (B) will be transferred to either the SST or the DHWT based on demand,” the scientists emphasized. “In case of insufficient supply from SST or DHWT, the auxiliary heater is turned on.”
The performance of the system was simulated through the TRNSYS software over a typical year of operation. Five optimization scenarios were considered: A minimum cost solution with no limits on possible gas usage; three scenarios with gas limit of 25%, 50%, and 75%, respectively; and a solution with minimal use of gas and high shares of solar thermal energy production.
The results of the simulation showed that with the Control (A) strategy, the net present cost of the system under scenario 1 is €72.2 and €144.7/MWh under scenario 5. The system payback period ranges from 31 years under scenario 1 and 63 years under scenario 5.
With the Control (B) approach, which always keeps the share of the solar thermal energy higher, the system achieves a net present cost of €67.12/MWh under scenario 1 and its payback period ranges from 29 to 59 years. “Besides, using control (B) reduces the usage dramatically for HP since under this control, the HP is utilized only to cover the shortage in SST during the high demand period of the season,” the academics further explained. “Well-designed heat pump control can bring techno-economic benefits in the district heating.”
The proposed system is described in the paper “Techno-economic analysis of control strategies for heat pumps integrated into solar district heating systems,” published in the Journal of Energy Storage.
Recently, a consortium of scientists and companies led by the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) has demonstrated the technical and economical feasibility of solar-powered heating of buildings in a given neighborhood, without the need for an external heat source. The proposed solar heating network is based on photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) solar systems that can generate both heat and electricity on the roof, a very-low-temperature heat network linked to heat or cold storage under the ground, and the use of heat pumps.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/25/allox-minerals-wants-to-scale-up-lithium-battery-material-production/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"AUGUST 25, 2021",Allox Minerals wants to scale up lithium battery material production,"From pv magazine India
Allox Minerals, a Hyderabad-based natural resource company, has started producing electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries under a government-owned, company-operated model at the International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy & New Materials (ARCI).
The company produces indigenous and economical lithium titanium oxide (LTO) anode and lithium ferrophosphate (LFP) cathode materials using a method developed by ARCI and is looking to scale up production according to electric vehicle (EV) battery market demand.
“We have sufficient supply of lithium to scale up the required production as and when the demand arises,” director Anjani Sri Mourya S told pv magazine. 
“We aim to become a leading global producer of precursors for next-generation lithium-ion battery cells while creating the supply chain that enables the future energy requirements of the world, the global storage of renewable energy and electrification of transportation.”
Allox Minerals primarily deals in lithium and other rare earth minerals. The company, through a joint venture led by a corporation of the government of Telangana, is acquiring mining rights of lithium in Bolivia and Brazil, alongside mining of key battery related minerals in India to ensure an uninterrupted supply chain to the existing and upcoming industries. It has already tied up with two companies in Bolivia and Brazil for supply to India.
Mourya said, “Lithium is found in brine and rock form and needs to be processed into lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide at the mining site as transportation of brines and spodumene is technically not possible to be processed at another location.”
“Allox has tied up with prominent technology providers for direct lithium extraction from brines and brine residual from the potential mines in South America that it aims to acquire along with the government of Telangana.”
Currently, India has no known source of lithium and lacks the capability of the entire value chain from precursors of the raw materials to cell fabrication. As a result, the nation entirely depends on imported cells from China and uses them to manufacture battery packs.
Allox Minerals aims to become an anchor supplier to any cell fabrication companies and any other companies that want to produce anode and cathode materials. The company is also looking to forward integrate up to battery assembly.
“While we look at forward integration, we provide required opportunities for companies to backward integrate and create an entire ecosystem here in India,” Mourya told pv magazine.
ARCI successfully synthesized carbon-coated LiFePO4 by a large-scale flame spray pyrolysis process followed by carbon coating and the electrochemical performance of the resulting material was found to be on par with commercial-scale carbon-coated LFP.
The method is economical and simple and has the potential to fine-tune the properties of the cathode produced.
Mourya said ARCI’s indigenous process is cheaper than with western counterparts’ technology and at par with Chinese companies. Besides, it produces a high-quality product, which is key for the long life and stability of the battery.

Thermoelectric modules are widely utilized for the electronic cooling of devices such as personal computer processors, portable food and beverage storage systems, and temperature-control car seats, among other uses.
The cooling system was built with an aluminum heat sink with a size of 10x40x100mm and a thermoelectric module with dimensions of 4x40x40mm and a weight of 25g. The hot part of the thermoelectric module was attached to the rear side of a 10 W solar panel and the cold part of it was connected to the heat sink through a silicon adhesive. The solar panel is cooled exclusively by the thermoelectric device, which is, in turn, cooled down by the heat sink via free convection.
The scientists used a laser thermometer to measure the panel's ambient and surface temperature and a multimeter to measure current and voltage. The measurements were taken on a sunny day in winter in Iran, between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m., at temperatures ranging from 10 to 17 degrees Celsius and the panel had a tilt angle of 45 degrees. “Data were recorded every 15 minutes with three replications to ensure the accuracy of the experiment and reduce human error,” the scientists specified.
The experiment showed that the average temperature of the solar panel without the cooling system was 37.78 degrees Celsius and that when the thermoelectric module was in operation, it dropped to 27.74 degrees Celsius, which corresponds to a 26.5% decrease in panel temperature. “The results show that the use of [a] thermoelectric module can increase the efficiency of solar panels by an average of 10.5%,” the Iranian group explained. “The average efficiency change on a normal solar panel was 0.117% and on a panel with a thermoelectric module it was 0.129%, indicating a 10.5% improvement.”
The academics concluded that the proposed cooling system proved to be effective in reducing the temperature of a solar panel and increasing electrical efficiency. A cost assessment of the novel technology, however, was not provided. All the details on the system can be found in the paper Evaluation of solar panel cooling systems using anodized heat sink equipped with thermoelectric module through the parameters of temperature, power and efficiency, which was recently published in Energy Conversion and Management: X.

The developer will hold a shareholder vote to approve the sale of seven of its solar project companies to state-owned buyer China Power Investment Xinjiang Energy Chemical Engineering Group Akesu Co Ltd, a subsidiary of the State Power Investment Corp.
The proposed disposal of 190 MW of solar generation capacity would leave Shunfeng with a 573 MW portfolio and book a loss on the value of the project businesses of RMB100 million (US$15.4 million) as the developer attempts to pay down a large debt pile.
Pick up your copy of pv magazine today for an in-depth look at batteries big and small; how they’re changing and how they are changing the world. What do batteries have in store for us? The August edition of pv magazine has answers to the big questions surrounding the battery energy storage revolution.
Shunfeng said it would use RMB488 million (US$75.3 million) of the RMB538 million (US$83 million) windfall expected from the sale, if approved, to pay down debts which include around US$324 million of overdue payments.
Listing its short term debts in an update to the Hong Kong exchange yesterday, Shunfeng said it had owed True Bold Global Ltd HK$172 million (US$22 million) since November 2019. Sino Alliance has been awaiting HK$351 million since the end of 2019 and HK$800 million (US$103 million) since the end of last year, although Shunfeng said it has signed a deal which will see investor Asia Pacific Resources shoulder a HK$1.2 billion (US$154 million) loan made to it by Sino Alliance, as part of a previous project sell-off in 2018. It was not clear from the Shunfeng update whether that $1.2 billion covered the HK$1.15 billion listed as owed to Sino Alliance.
Shunfeng said it has owed bondholders RMB330 million (US$50.9 million) since March 31 last year, for an instrument issued in 2015, and has owed Chongqing International Trust RMB666 million since September 30 last year.
The developer will also have to find RMB255 million (US$39.4 million) by October 25, to settle with bondholders who purchased a 2016 investment; HK$175 million by November 30, to settle with Rainbow Fort Investment Ltd; and HK$300 million to settle up with China Minsheng Banking Corp by the end of the year.
On the positive side of the ledger, the company added, it expects to bank RMB15.6 million (US$2.4 million) by September 30, from a sale of six solar project companies announced in March last year; and the end of next month is also due to see completion of a sale of the profitable Lattice Power LED business in which Shunfeng holds a 58.3% stake, generating a further RMB391 million (US$60.3 million). The developer said it also expects the final RMB81.7 million (US$12.6 million) it is owed from a 490 MW project sale it conducted in 2019, with that cash expected to be banked this year.
Explaining the need for further sales of its solar estate, Shunfeng said it had banked national clean energy subsidies owed to it only as far as March 2018 and had subsidies receivable of RMB1.77 billion (US$273 million) and “receivables on accrued revenue on tariff subsidies from the state grid” of RMB1.71 billion (US$264 million).

Researchers from Monash University, in league with national water utilities, are setting out to uncover ways in which wastewater can be used to produce green hydrogen even more sustainably.
Although the federal government isn’t quite helping, Australia is set to be a green hydrogen superpower in the coming decades. With the Sunburnt Country’s natural resources of wind, solar and open space, it is the ideal exporter of green hydrogen and ammonia to energy hungry net-zero committed nations such as South Korea and Japan. However, as many Australians are well aware, water is not always a resource Australia has an abundance of, so utilizing wastewater could be a great boon.
According to the Sustainable Hydrogen Production from Used Water (SHPUS) project, at least 5.5 billion liters of water will be needed annually if Australia is to meet its 2030 hydrogen production target as set out by the National Hydrogen Strategy. That’s the annual water consumption of 1.6 million people.
The SHPUS project, which recently received an ARC Linkage grant, is looking to make sure Australia’s future hydrogen export market doesn’t exacerbate the nation’s water scarcity problems. To this end, the project is developing an innovative way to repurpose wastewater for use in the water electrolysis process.
Researchers from Monash University’s Department of Chemical Engineering, including Professors Xiwang Zhang, Professor Huanting Wang, and Dr Yinlong Zhu believe there is more than enough wastewater generated by Australia’s major cities that freshwater consumption can be minimized.

“The amount of wastewater currently available for use is far more than the amount of water required in water electrolysis for hydrogen production,” said Zhang. “Most of the treated water throughout Australia is currently discharged to surrounding water bodies or recycled for irrigation after being treated in centralized municipal wastewater treatment plants. Given the volume of the treated water from these plants is highly consistent, it is a promising water source for water electrolysis.”
Monash’s researchers are joining forces with the utilities, including Southeast Water, Melbourne Water, Yarra Valley Water and Water Corporation via Water Research Australia (WaterRA).
WaterRA’s Dr. Arash Zamyadi said that while current water treatment processes effectively remove the majority of pollutants, there are still some small “residual organics and ions” remaining, and we need to know how to remove them too.
“There still remains a knowledge gap in how the impurities affect water electrolyzer design and process operation,” said Zamyadi. “Through this research, we hope to develop an in-depth understanding of the impacts of water impurities in used water on the performance and durability of water electrolyzers, and subsequently develop guidelines for the design of highly durable water electrolyzers and the operation and upgrade of existing wastewater treatment plants.”
With Australia’s hydrogen exports expected to bring in $10 billion to the Australian economy each year through the annual sale of more than 3 million tonnes of green hydrogen and/or ammonia by 2040, the sustainability of this supply chain is of immense importance.

Homeowners are increasingly being driven to buy or lease solar with energy storage by news-making grid failures, power outages, and higher electricity rates, said a survey conducted by SunPower.
The 2021 SunPower Energy Sense Index surveyed 1,500 homeowners in the U.S., to learn what their home energy experience is, what they understand about the energy industry, and what motivates them to buy solar.
One finding is that many Americans live in fear of power outages. About 40% of respondents said that they worry about outages on a monthly basis. One in five said that they were concerned about losing their power every week. And more than half said they had experienced a power outage in the last year that has caused their trust in their utility provider to diminish.

One third of this group said they see high-profile outages, such as those   in Texas this past February, as a central reason to shop for backup power sources. Of those considering solar, 70% said they plan to include a battery energy storage system.
Homeowners who said they experienced an outage in the last year are four times more likely to have purchased solar and storage, said the report.
While solar in the past has been adopted by younger Americans, this has begun to shift. About 74% of current solar customers are from the Millennial and Gen Z generations, and are dominated largely by consumers living in the West and South. However, Baby Boomers now represent the majority of those newly considering solar at 55%, a step up from the 11% who already have solar.
Solar has also historically been relegated to those with higher incomes, but this trend, too, may be shifting. Nearly three quarters of homeowners who took part in the survey and are considering solar earned less than $100,000 a year per household, as compared to the 34% in this income bracket that currently have solar.
Location can be indicative of interest in solar with California the clear frontrunner. But respondents revealed the Midwest is now the region with the second highest proportion of people actively considering solar.
Politically, it was found that 68% of current solar owners identify as Democrats, with Independents (30%) and Republicans (29%) following.

Energy bill savings continues to reign supreme as the motivator for going solar. Over 92% of the respondents said this was a top reason.
This was followed by the desire for resiliency in power outages, which 88% of respondents said was a motivating factor. And 73% of solar shoppers said they were interested in reducing their carbon footprint.
Two thirds of respondents who said they would never consider solar cited high cost as the reason, but the survey also found that 60% of homeowners overestimate what solar costs. EnergySage has pegged the average cost at around $20,000. Nearly half of these “never solar” respondents said a significantly lower cost of energy would change their minds.
