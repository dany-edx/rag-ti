It will install Trisolar’s  crop-responsive PV tracking system in greenhouses across six locations.
“The TriSolar tracking system is designed to be used with specially designed semi transparent bifacial PV modules, that are optimized for this agrivoltaic application inside greenhouses, to optimize light distribution inside the greenhouse as well as maximizing electrical output of the PV system,” a project spokesperson told pv magazine.
The Regace project will also evaluate the effectiveness of the PV modules, which were manufactured by an unspecified manufacturer. One of the other aims of the project is to test the energy yield of the tracker systems in greenhouses across different locations and climates.
“A first trial in a Mediterranean climate has shown that an increase of around 20% can be achieved compared to a fixed installation in a greenhouse,” the spokesperson said. “Due to it being crop responsive, it does not harm the crops below the system.”
The pilot will install “relatively small” greenhouses in universities and research institutes in Germany, Austria, Greece, and Israel. It will also test the tracking system at two operational farms in Germany and Italy. The exact sizes of the installations are still being planned.
The Regace project will use carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment methods to increase crop yield, including bottled CO2 enrichment, CO2 enrichment using CO2 bags, and using agricultural offcuts, compost, or manure to increase CO2 levels inside the greenhouse.
The consortium includes 12 research institutes and commercial organizations from five different countries: Fattoria Sociali del Circeo, Humbolt University of Berlin, Tel Aviv University, University of Rome Tor Vergata, University of Thessaly, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, BIO-Gärtnerei Watzkendorf, and Interteam. The project is supported by a €5.5 million ($5.89 million) grant from the European Union through the Horizon Europe Research and Innovation funding program.

The Singapore-based company has developed a modular vanadium redox flow battery energy storage system, PowerCube. It can be deployed anywhere, from residential settings to solar and wind farms, in three versions: 5 kW, 10 kW, and 100 kW. The rated energy capacity stands at 30 kWh, 100 kWh, and 500 kWh,  respectively.
PowerCube has a 25-year lifespan, and its module cycle life exceeds 10,000 cycles. Unlike lithium-ion batteries, the system can be fully discharged to 100%. Its roundtrip efficiency is more than 80%. The technology is non-flammable and 100% recyclable, recoverable up to 30% of initial costs. It can operate in temperatures from -10 to 55 degrees Celsius without active cooling. PowerCube’s total installation weight stands at 1,000 kg, 2,500 kg, and 10,000 kg across the three variants.
The company says the system’s levelized cost of storage (LCOS) is as low as $0.10/kWh. By changing the volume of the liquid stored in tanks, PowerCube can be easily scalable from kilowatt to megawatt scale.
The three versions of PowerCube are available in AC and DC configurations. The PowerCube 5-30 is designed for residential storage, telecoms towers, and solar trackers in remote areas that rely on diesel generators. The 10-100 version is suitable for commercial and industrial applications and off-grid solutions, while the 100-500 version can be coupled with solar and wind farms, or integrated with EV charging stations.
VFlowTech was incubated in the CleanTech lab of Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, and benefits from unique IP arising from many years of intensive research at the university. The company has also developed its own energy management system (EMS). To date, it has mainly deployed 30 kWh and 100 kWh units for residential applications, but is now preparing to cater to larger-scale customers.

The association said that 210 mm/150 μm, G12 monocrystalline wafers are selling for CNY 8.0 to CNY 8.2 each, for a week-on-week increase of 34.4%.
It attributed the price increases to higher polysilicon prices and unspecified shortages in the supply chain. Polysilicon prices have risen since the start of the year, after a relatively long period of decline toward the end of 2022, according to additional data released by CNMIA last week.

Contracted volumes fell to 8.4 GW, down 21% from 2021, but the total number of PPAs increased by 4.5% in 2022, with 161 agreements.
Corporate PPAs accounted for 80% of the total in 2022, and 83% of the contracted volumes. The contracted capacity of corporate PPAs grew by at least 20%, from just 5.8 GW in 2021.
“The maturity of the PPA market shone in the middle of the European energy crisis, and the resistance it showed was, at the very least, remarkable,” said Luca Pedretti, director of operations (COO) for Pexapark.
Spain was the largest PPA market last year, with around 3.2 GW of disclosed capacity across 31 deals. Spanish companies Greenalia and Endesa accounted for more than 1.8 GW, or 20%, of the contracted capacity.
The top five buyers were Alcoa (1,830 MW), Microsoft (900 MW), Amazon (420 MW), Renault (350 MW), and Meta (300 MW), while the top five sellers were Greenalia (924 MW), Endesa (906 MW), Statkraft (687 MW), Energia Group & Power Capital Renewable Energy (534 MW), and Voltalia (380 MW).
“The year experienced extreme volatility levels throughout, but two spikes are the ones to be remembered the most: January 2022, and September 2022 where volatility reached up to 230%,” said Pexapark.

It claims it has the largest capacity in the world. It developed it to service Shell's hydrogen refueling stations in North America and Europe, starting with the United States and Germany. The trailer can transport and store hydrogen.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has granted California-based Universal Hydrogen a special airworthiness certificate in the experimental category to proceed with the first flight of its hydrogen-powered regional aircraft. The Dash 8-300 flying testbed has a megawatt-class hydrogen fuel cell powertrain installed in one of its nacelles. It will be the largest hydrogen fuel cell-powered aircraft to fly. The company expects its first model to start commercial passenger services by 2025. It said the new architecture significantly reduces weight and lifecycle costs. The fuel cells transmit all power directly to the electric motor, rather than resorting to a hybrid battery architecture.
Masdar has signed an agreement with Austrian utility Verbund to explore the production of green hydrogen for the Central European market. “The two companies will cooperate on developing pathways to produce and export green hydrogen to Central Europe, specifically Austria, and Southern Germany,” said Masdar. 
The Energy Future Initiatives (EFI) said that the United States needs additional policy and regulatory actions on top of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to drive hydrogen demand. “There will be a cost gap between the supply side incentives of the IRA and the conditions needed to accelerate demand in most commercial use cases, critical for market formation,” stated the team, which is led by former US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz. EFI has proposed the development of regional hubs as market development engines, the activation of early investments for market-ready applications, the expansion of hydrogen R&D, and the prioritization of permitting and local supply chain development. 
Kyushu University researchers have reported that the degradation of electrodes and membranes is accelerated by potential and temperature changes in electrolyzers. The Japanese scientists are therefore arguing for international protocols to standardize accelerated degradation tests for water electrolysis technologies powered by variable power sources. “Inputs of fluctuating currents into an electrolyzer change not only the voltage of the electrolyzer, but also its temperature and gas pressure, gas purity, and gas generation amount over time,” the team said in a recent report in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. 
Doosan Fuel Cell has agreed to cooperate with the South Australian government to expand its hydrogen business. The two parties have agreed to exchange equipment and expertise,  while jointly establishing strategies, securing research partnerships, and building infrastructure for the supply and use of green hydrogen, according to the South Korean company.
The UK government has outlined plans for a low-carbon hydrogen certification scheme. “The government will now begin consultation with industry, with the intention of introducing the certification scheme by 2025,” it said.
Hexagon Purus has secured a €2.5 million ($2.69 million) order for mobile hydrogen refueling stations and stationary storage systems from Germany's national railway operator, Deutsche Bahn.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/10/photovoltaic-thermal-module-based-on-biochar-pcm-achieves-79-6-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 10, 2023",Photovoltaic-thermal module based on biochar-PCM achieves 79.6% efficiency,"Scientists led by the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati have developed a photovoltaic-thermal (PV) module that can reportedly achieve an overall efficiency of 79.6%.
“The water-based system generates hot water with sufficient temperature to be utilized for domestic usage,” researcher Dudul Das told pv magazine. “The average electrical and thermal efficiency of the PVT system with novel form-stable thermal energy storage material is reported to be 13 % and 66.6 %, respectively.”
The researchers built the system with a 100 W solar panel provided by India's Central Electronics, an absorber with a rectangular spiral configuration using copper tubes with a diameter of 7.9 mm, and a PCM based on biochar derived from water hyacinth, which is an aquatic weed available across Southeast Asia and South America, for the cooling system.
They attached the tube assembly to the back surface of the PV panel using an epoxy adhesive with thermal conductivity of 0.14 W per millikelvin (mK).
“After fixing the tube assembly onto the PV surface, a 10 mm thick layer of PCM-biochar composite is inserted,” the scientists explained. “The composite is inserted from a corner and diagonally filled up.”
They then insulated the panel with a layer of polyethylene foam sheet and installed a plexiglass back cover to protect the system from moisture, dust and wind. They used a field emission-scanning electron microscope to analyze surface morphologies, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) to assess crystallinity and phase change identification, and a thermal conductivity meter to evaluate the thermal conductivity of the composite material.
The panel showed better thermal efficiency when tested under outdoor conditions with a tilt angle of 26 degrees.
“The application of the form-stable PCM-biochar composite has successfully regulated the thermal output of the PVT system,” the academics said. “The thermal efficiency even after the solar radiation drops, remains closer to 50%, whereas, without PCM, it drops to 38%.”
They found that the panel's thermal efficiency varied from 60.3% to a maximum of 71.2%, while its electrical output was 18.4% higher than a reference PV panel without the thermal unit.
“The thermal conductivity of the PCM is enhanced up to 1.55 times with the addition of water hyacinth biochar as a supporting matrix,” the scientists said. “The addition of aluminum metal powder further increases the thermal conductivity by 1.66 times higher than that of PCM alone.”
The research group originally presented the system in “Performance investigation of a rectangular spiral flow PV/T collector with a novel form-stable composite material,” which was published in Applied Thermal Engineering in January 2021.
“An interesting information the work has put forward is that the difference in electrical output between PVT system with PCM bio-composite and PV during the peak sunshine hours of the day can be as large as 18 W,” Das concluded, adding that the simplified economic analysis of the system shows that its internal rate of return is 28%, with a levelized cost of energy of $0.05/kWh.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/10/tandem-perovskite-silicon-solar-cells-retain-80-of-efficiency-after-year/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SAUDI ARABIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 10, 2023",Tandem perovskite-silicon solar cells retained 80% of efficiency after 1 year,"Scientists from Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) have conducted a one-year outdoor test for a tandem perovskite-silicon solar cell they developed in 2020. They have found that the device retained more than 80% of its initial efficiency during the testing period between April 2021 and April 2022.
“We are not talking about 500 hours or 1,000 hours in a lab-controlled environment, but rather real outdoor measurement during multiple years,” researcher Maxime Babics told pv magazine, noting that the testing has only just started. “Now that the efficiency of tandem cells is beyond 30%, I really think that it is time to focus on stability, having in mind at least a two-decade operation goal.”
The research group described its findings in “One-year outdoor operation of monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells,” which was recently published in Cell Reports Physical Science. They noted the importance of robust encapsulation to minimize encapsulation-related failures.
The academics soldered two metal wires on both sides of the cell to extend the electrode contacts. They then encapsulated the device between two layers of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and glass before module lamination.
They deployed the tandem solar cell at a tilt angle of 25 degrees and a southern orientation. They then tested it at a KAUST testing facility in Saudi Arabia, with a global horizontal irradiance (GHI) of approximately 2,240 kWh per square meter.
“The combination of high irradiance, high temperature, and high relative humidity makes this given location a challenging environment for perovskite-based solar cells but a most relevant location to study the outdoor resilience of PV technologies,” said the scientists.
The tandem device's fill factor remained above 78% for the first four months and then gradually decreased from August until December to around 72%. At the end of the first year of operation, it remained above 70%.
“Knowing that the fill factor is the parameter that is most prone to degrade outdoors, the results are promising toward achieving stable tandem technology,” the researchers said.
They noted that by the end of April 2021, the cell was still able to retain more than 80% of its initial efficiency.
“It is a big jump for us in terms of outdoor stability but it is clear that we have room for improvement,” Babics said. “It is also important to mention that this generation of tandems was developed in our lab at the end of 2020 and I am confident to say that the new generation of the tandem that we are fabricating at the moment could provide better results.”

Iberdrola says it will build its first floating solar plant in Europe on the Bischwiller quarry in the French municipality of Kurtzenhouse, in the region of Alsace. The Spanish energy company secured the project in a tender last year. It will build the 25 MW facility on a quarry that has been flooded with water.
In January, Iberdrolas launched environmental and technical studies to choose the most appropriate technological solutions for the project and the site. It expects to complete the studies in early 2024. It will request building permits in spring 2024 for commissioning by the end of summer 2026.
The energy company says it will choose local companies to build the plant. It told pv magazine that it will specialize in the development of floating photovoltaic solar projects on active industrial sites.
Iberdrola has been present in France for 20 years and plans to invest around €4 billion ($43 billion) by 2025, mainly in renewable energy projects. It recently announced the signing of a PPA with Solvay for a plant in France. In addition, it is currently building a 496 MW offshore wind farm in the Bay of Saint-Brieuc.
Iberdrola currently operates 11 wind projects with a total installed capacity of 118 MW. It is now developing an 800 MW portfolio of wind and PV projects.

SnapNrack has announced TopSpeed, an innovative new solar panel mount designed to be attached to the panel on the ground, before being hoisted to the rooftop for installation.
The solar racking supplier said the new product is aimed at reducing installation times and limiting time spent on rooftops. SnapNrack said the duration of time spent on rooftops can be cut by more than 50%, compared to traditional racking solutions. This is a boon to the safety of installation workers.
The mounts are attached to the roof, leveled and aligned on SnapNrack’s universal skirt. The process helps simplify materials staging and racking assembly.
The installation process involves three steps. First, TopSpeed mounts are attached to the solar modules. Next, wire management is performed, with Smart Clips and module level power electronics (MLPE) frame kits set in place. These first two steps are performed on the ground, while the universal skirt is laid out on the roof. Finally, the modules are quickly affixed to the skirt.
The product is UL certified and is rated to perform under 90 mph to 180 mph wind loads and up to 90 pounds per square foot of snow load. All mounts are secured with a proprietary half-inch head wood screw and roof sealant. The design allows for single-tool installation. The mounting system includes new features like retained fasteners and deck mounts.
The product is made of alloy aluminum and 300 series stainless steel. It is finished on the top with a black oxide bolt and bonding clip and a black anodized clamp, while the bottom has a mill finish. It is approved for installations between zero-degree and 90-degree roof pitches.
The product will be displayed at Intersolar North America 2023 in Long Beach, California, at the SnapNrack b0oth from Feb. 14 to Feb. 16.

Christchurch Airport has selected Lightsource bp – an equal joint venture between UK-based solar specialist Lightsource and oil giant BP – and New Zealand's Contract Energy as its partners to help develop the first 150 MW phase of the planned Kōwhai Park renewable energy precinct.
The first stage of the park will initially consist of a 150 MW solar farm capable of generating 290 GWh of clean energy per year which will be utilised to help the aviation industry shift away from fossil fuels. Battery energy storage and green hydrogen generation are also earmarked for the precinct in the future, with Christchurch Airport seeking to accelerate the decarbonisation of industry in New Zealand.
“This starts with the solar farm but we’re working to include green hydrogen generation down the track,” Christchurch Airport Chief Executive Officer Justin Watson said. “Kōwhai Park will enable low-emissions aviation and help provide the extra green energy New Zealand needs to transition away from fossil fuels. We’re excited to have found partners with the technical capability to do this well and the values to ensure it’s done right.”
The solar farm, to comprise an estimated 300,000 solar panels, will be developed on a 300-hectare site adjacent to the runways at the Christchurch airport. The location is close to power distributor Orion’s network and to grid operator Transpower’s lines.
Subject to a final investment decision, construction of the solar farm is expected to commence in 2024. The Kōwhai Park project is Lightsource bp’s first in New Zealand, but it is unlikely to be the last.
