The €750,000 project is expected to be carried out in the fourth quarter of this year, Apollo said in a statement.
The manufacturer said that each of its module units has a size of 2,040×6,130mm and weighs in at 3kg/m². It also explained that the panels are equipped with sliding beads for easy installation and that the system requires minimal assembly, depending on the roof type. Furthermore, the modules lay flat on the roof surface, making them wind resistant.

Apollo's first roof project, a 120kW system built in Israel, was installed during November 2021.
“This order from Amazon is an important milestone in realizing Apollo Power's vision,” the latter company's CEO, Oded Rosenberg, said. “Our solution is designed to allow the exploitation of commercial and logistics spaces that cannot support the weight of glass solar panels and that require, instead, a light and flexible solution. At the same time, we are making progress in the construction of a new production plant which will expand our manufacturing capacity by 20 [times].”
The Israeli company was founded in 2014 and is currently based in Yokneam, in the northern part of the country.

With the pandemic and its knock-on effects on global supply chains having, since 2020, halted years of thumping panel price cost reductions, a report published today by GlobalData stated that as far as rooftop solar modules are concerned: “Cost is expected to moderately increase in 2022.”

Buildings are key to our daily lives and significantly impact our health and wellbeing. The majority also have substantial carbon footprints and employ heavy use of fossil fuels across their lifetimes, from construction to their use and demolition. pv magazine’s UP Initiative is focusing on the role solar and energy storage can play in greening the world’s urban spaces. Read our urban solar coverage here.

Interestingly, a note issued by the analyst to publicize its Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Market, 2021 – Global Market Size, Market Share, Major Trends, and Key Country Analysis to 2030 report did not point to last year's shortage of panel raw material polysilicon as a reason for rising module prices.
GlobalData power analyst Attaurrahman Ojindaram Saibasan instead highlighted the fact post-Covid supply chain headaches had reduced the volume of solar cells and modules available for shipping, with delays in shipments confounded by shortages of workers due to pandemic-related restrictions on movement.
Basing its numbers on the 10-12 340W solar panels required to power a 1,200 square foot residence, GlobalData said the cost of rooftop arrays had fallen $600-900 per year from a level of around $9,300 in 2014 to $4,550 by the time Covid-19 brought the world to a standstill in 2020.
Last year, by contrast, the price of a rooftop system rebounded $700 to a level not seen since 2018, GlobalData said, and that increasing expense is not expected to be reversed this year.
Even when a return to falling rooftop solar prices arrives in 2023, the rest of the decade will be marked by costs that decline “gradually,” according to the analyst, as component costs retreat again, production volume is scaled up, and panel technology advances.
The study noted that with the world's rooftop solar systems in 2020 roughly split a third for residential and two-thirds for commercial and industrial arrays, China accounted for 12.4% of the near-249GW of rooftop panel generation capacity installed by the end of that year.
That contribution helped Asia claim 53.5% of the world's rooftop panels at the end of 2020, with 29.1% in Europe and 13.6% in the Americas, according to GlobalData.

“The company is one of the market leaders and recognized for its excellence in the quality of its products and proximity to its accredited partners,” Intelbras said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Brazil. “The acquisition will provide the company's various sales channels and partners with a great opportunity to expand the availability of products to the local market and [benefit] the entire [supply] chain. In addition, the network of partners and installers will be expanded in an accelerated and synergistic way.”
According to Intelbras, Renovigi achieved a turnover of BRL799.4 million and EBITDA of BRL49.8 million in the past fiscal year. The system integrator is mainly active in the distributed generation segment, which in Brazil includes all PV systems not exceeding 5MW in size.
In July, Renovigi announced a plan to build PV system assembly factory at the Port of Pecém, in the state of Ceará, in northeastern Brazil. In 2020, the company sought to diversify its pool of suppliers when restrictions were imposed by Covid-19.
The company currently operates two production units, in Itajaí, in the state of Santa Catarina; and in Louveira, in São Paulo, where it integrates complete photovoltaic systems which are then distributed among its more-than-9,000 accredited installers. The factories use modules supplied by Risen, JA Solar, Canadian Solar, Sunshine, Talesun, and BYD.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/16/chile-launches-5-25gwh-renewable-energy-auction/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHILE",LUISA CABELLO,"FEBRUARY 16, 2022",Chile launches 5.25GWh renewable energy auction,"From pv magazine LatAm
The Chilean energy regulator (CNE) has launched an auction to provide 5.25GWh of electricity for the national system over a period of 15 years from 2027.
The CNE said on its website that the consultation period for participants will last until April 1. Participants will be able to make rectifications, amendments or additions to their proposals until May 2. The final offers must be submitted by July 1. The final results will be announced between July 25 and Aug. 1.
In Chile's last energy auction, in August, the CNE assigned 2.31TWh of renewable energy. The lowest price submitted was $0.01332/kWh.
Chile's cumulative PV installations hit 4.6GW at the end of March, according to the latest figures from ACERA, the Chilean renewable energy association. Utility-scale PV plants account for most of the country's installed solar capacity, with rooftop PV accounting for just 167 MW. Small solar parks with capacities of up to 9MW – developed under the Pequeños Medios de Generación Distribuida program for distributed generation – account for 1.35GW of the total.

The figures he was highlighting were $552 million of business in the October-to-December window – up 5% on the previous three months and 54% on the same period of a Covid-affected 2020 – and $1.96 billion for the whole year, which amounted to a 35% rise on the $1.46 billion recorded in 2020.
In this month’s edition, pv magazine takes a deep dive into the world of electromobility, with 22 pages of analysis taking in the market growth and expectations for electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide; how electricity networks will need to grow and adapt to make room for the electrification of transport; and the vital role for solar in all of this. We examine the growing trend for residential and commercial EV chargers linked to PV and optimized to make the most of solar kilowatt-hours, and take a look at some of the early movers working on vehicle-integrated PV – from solar sunroofs to full integration in vehicle bodywork. We also consider a range of e-mobility applications, from commercial trucks to family cars to electric bikes and other “last mile” delivery vehicles.
The only flies in the ointment were a dip in gross margin during the final three months of last year which saw SolarEdge bank less profit per product according to quarterly and annual comparisons and the fact the company posted lower net income in the last quarter than it did in July-to-September.
Neither of those numbers, however, appear to have affected the resilient company's bottom line, with SolarEdge reporting it had $548 million in the bank at the end of the year, some $24 million more than it had three months earlier.
That net income dip in the final quarter failed to prevent the manufacturer posting a full-year figure which, at $169 million, was 21% higher than the $140 million banked for 2020.
Putting aside a rare proofreading error in the summary of the figures released by SolarEdge yesterday – which suggested the three-month outlook section of the document related to Q4 2021, rather than the current window – and Lando and the board appear positive about current performance, amid predictions of more record-busting quarterly revenue of $615-645 million, including $575-595 million from the company's solar business.

Do you believe TOPCon products have now reached full commercial maturity in all markets?
TOPCon modules have been available commercially for [a] few years and the main obstacle was the higher prices associated with them. The price difference between the mainstream, P-type PERC products and n-type TOPCon panels used to reach 30% but now, with the current optimization of production technologies, JinkoSolar was able to solve many issues in producing TOPCon cells, especially the round-around poly, which enabled us to easily switch our current PERC production lines into TOPCon.
In an upcoming webinar, we will discuss, among other things, the potential of TOPCon modules for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Why should this large and geographically diverse region be considered an ideal market for products with higher efficiencies?
TOPCon cell efficiency is approximately 1% higher than PERC cells but, as the PERC is reaching its theoretical efficiency, TOPCon still has very big potential for improvement. Having higher-efficiency modules is recommended in every project and for any application, in MENA's case it’s a critical requirement, it leads to improved generation and reduced balance-of-system (BOS) and logistics costs, and with the current supply chain conditions, it’s a necessity to have high-efficiency modules.
What kind of technical issues may potentially arise for TOPCon modules in markets characterized by high temperatures and difficult environmental conditions?
Image: JinkoSolar
The MENA region has huge potential when it comes to solar energy. It’s exposed to high solar irradiance but at the same time it is exposed to harsh weather conditions. It has high temperatures and humidity, especially during the summer months. For these reasons, we believe the n-type TOPCon modules will show extraordinary performance in these harsh weather conditions, compared to cold regions, because these panels have an excellent temperature coefficient which is more than 15% better than the mainstream temperature coefficient for p-type PERC, as well as an improved low-light performance, and optimized bi-facility factor. All these factors will contribute to excellent performance in [the] MENA region.
How would you judge the current trade-off between efficiency and price in TOPCOn products in general, and in projects developed in the MENA region?
We are in close contact with the key developers in the region, where there is a pipeline of more than 15GW of projects in the next 2-3 years, and we have started to see that the n-type TOPCon is the preferred option by developers as the price gap between p-type PERC and n-type TOPCon can be repaid by higher efficiency, a better warranty and superior technical specs.
Are you seeing strong demand for TOPCon panels in the region? Could these products be able to outcompete PERC panels in the future?
Yes, we [have] started to see increasing demand and many of our partners have already placed orders. The TOPCon is available in different cell sizes, starting from 54 cells with a power output of 410Wp up to 78 cells with a power output exceeding 600Wp. It can be used for both utility and DG applications and we expect the demand to grow further this year and next year. We have already allocated 10GW of production capacity for n-type TOPCon modules, which is around 25% from JinkoSolar's total capacity for 2022, and we believe next year the demand will grow higher and we may add another 10GW. We think,in three years, the demand for TOPCon panels will exceed that for PERC products.

“Viologen is not expensive with scalable production,” researcher Tianbiau Liu told pv magazine. “The estimated cost of viologen flow batteries is under $100/kWh.”
The battery was conceived to be mainly used to store electricity generated by large scale wind and solar power plants, although its creators do not exclude it may also find application in residential and commercial projects. “Unlike established li-ion, Pb-acid, or vanadium flow batteries, USU’s AORFB can meet the safety and cost targets necessary for viability at large scale,” the research group emphasized.
The ph-neutral battery is claimed to be more cost-effective, sustainable, and efficient than conventional redox flow batteries. “This system can be scaled to buffer the intermittent energy output from wind and solar while maintaining a safe, non-flammable and non-corrosive energy storage system at residential, military, industrial and utility system installations,” they added.
The device has a rated power of over 150mW/cm2, an energy density exceeding 40Wh/L, and a power density of 72.5mW/cm2. “Pairing with water-soluble TEMPO or ferrocene cathode materials, the AORFBs deliver up to 1.72V voltage and 45.5Wh/L theoretical energy density with excellent cycling stability,” the scientists said, noting the device is also able to retain 100% of its initial capacity after 1,000 cycles.
The high-conductivity aqueous electrolytes and ion-conductive membranes used for the device are described as the crucial components, allowing high current and high power operation.
“We started developing the battery in 2014 and we are currently seeking to bring it to commercial production,” Liu stated.
A complete description of the battery, the cathodes, and the anode can be found in the paper “Unprecedented Capacity and Stability of Ammonium Ferrocyanide Catholyte in pH Neutral Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries,” published in Joule.

The Hi-MO 5m module has a rated power of 415W and a power conversion efficiency of 21.25%.
“Hi-MO 5m 54-cell modules feature PERC gallium-doped, p-type half-cut cells with the highest resistance against light aging (lowest LID) for maximum energy yield and are backed with a 25-year performance warranty,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “This technology has won performance and technology awards from the Renewable Energy Testing Center (RETC) and PV Evolution Labs (PVEL).”
The manufacturer said the new panels have a size of 1,722×1,134mm. “Their short circuit current is low and well below 15A,” it further explained. “At less than 2m² in size and less than 23kg in weight, the module [is] small and light enough for one person to install.”
According to the manufacturer, the new Hi-MO 5m 54-cell series can be deployed with standard mounting systems clamping onto the long and short sides of the module frame, as well as lay-in or slide-in systems and elevation systems with module edge clamping. “The modules are also compatible with most popular inverters,” it also stated, without providing further technical details.

A recent fire that badly damaged a home in Adelaide, Australia, was reportedly caused by a home battery system. The incident has once again put the spotlight on safety issues surrounding lithium-ion battery technology.
Stuart Dawes, the northern operations commander for the South Australian Metropolitan Fire Service, has described lithium-ion battery storage systems as an “emerging hazard to fire services around the nation,” reported the ABC.
Investigators have yet to determine what caused the fire and whether a fault in the product is to blame. It is not known what brand of battery the homeowner had installed.
Dawes said fire services across Australia are currently developing policies and procedures to cope with the rise of such incidents. It is critical for home battery systems to be properly stored and maintained, with exposure to excessive heat or punctures potentially leading to thermal runaway events.

Last year, pv magazine’s Insight Australia event looked at the safety issues surrounding lithium-ion technology. Professor Paul Christensen, one of the world’s leading experts on battery fires and safety, said that global uptake of lithium-ion battery technology has “outstripped” our knowledge of the risks.
The problem with lithium-ion batteries, he said, is also the reason they are so useful: They store an enormous amount of energy in a small space. If that energy starts getting released in an uncontrolled way due to overheating or puncturing, it can lead to a thermal runaway event.
Thermal runaway involves chemical reactions occurring inside the battery which produce heat and gases. The heat caused by these reactions then accelerates further reactions, creating a “runaway” chain which can potentially lead to fires or explosions.
According to Christensen, there have been around 40 utility-scale lithium-ion battery fires around the world over the last three years. It is far more difficult to say how many residential battery fires there have been. This is because, similar to solar-caused fires, different state authorities record the data differently or not at all.
In October, the ABC also reported on a fire that broke out in a home in Broome, Western Australia. The fire was not caused by a residential battery system, but by a lithium-ion battery used for a cordless drill that was left charging overnight. As with the fire over the weekend in South Australia, the damage to the home was extensive.
Ben Muller, area officer for West Kimberley at the Department of Fire and Emergency Services, estimates that 15 to 20 fires a year are caused by lithium-ion batteries. He noted it is “certainly an increasing trend,” according to the ABC. Muller suggested installing extra smoke detectors in rooms with lithium batteries.

Enphase Energy has agreed to participate in Swell Energy’s virtual power plant (VPP) program in Hawaii, New York and California.
Swell Energy’s VPPs aggregate solar and energy storage systems to provide savings to customers for sending excess stored solar energy to the grid. Customers in the three states that have Enphase’s IQ Batteries will be able to participate in the program.
VPPs offer a range of services to utilities, including a reduced dependence on fossil fuels and increased grid reliability and stability. By aggregating distributed energy resources, Swell Energy is able to participate in the wholesale market, connecting homeowners to the advantages of the transactive energy market.
“Our partnership with Enphase enables homeowners to interact with the power grid in new ways and maximize the value delivered by their home batteries,” said Suleman Khan, CEO of Swell Energy. “The combined offer puts participating customers in control of their electrons with greater functionality, automation, and value within the transactive grid of the future.”
Enphase’s IQ batteries are lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, which the company said provide a long life cycle and smooth operation, due to their thermal stability. The Enphase Power Start technology is integrated with the battery, allowing for a seamless power-on of air conditioners and well-pumps during outages. A single unit of the IQ Battery 10 system comes with integrated microinverters, three 3.36kWh base battery units, and a battery case. The total capacity is 10.5kWh, with a round-trip efficiency of 96%.
The batteries can be mounted on walls. Through an Enphase app, homeowners can monitor charge levels, and the IQ batteries can perform remote software upgrades. The batteries are equipped with a 10 year/ 4000 cycles limited warranty.
Enphase also builds the IQ8 inverter, which has the ability to form a microgrid in the case of an outage, even if no home energy storage is attached.
“Together with Swell we share a mission to provide a world-class customer experience and cutting edge, smart technology,” said Dave Ranhoff, chief commercial officer at Enphase Energy. “Swell’s programs make it even more compelling for homeowners to choose Enphase Energy Systems, so they can reliably and efficiently run their lives on clean energy, protect against grid outages, and better manage costs.”
