Presenting the findings of the Shanghai-based accountant appointed on the advice of former GCL auditor Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu to look into the matter, GCL today said the manager of the company's Jiangsu Zhongneng subsidiary only had clearance to approve contracts with up to RMB100 million (US$15.5 million) of capital spending.
The investigator, part of the Mazars global grouping, said the unidentified manager had agreed to make the RMB510 million pre-payment to the unnamed state-owned enterprise which had been appointed lead contractor by GCL to carry out engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services on the planned granular polysilicon production unit. GCL had been eager to to break ground on the planned fab after improving its production processes but, unable to access the necessary finance, had been offered backing by the state-owned lead EPC contractor on condition that it made the pre-payment at the heart of the investigation. In those circumstances, the investigator found, the general manager of Jiangsu Zhongneng had approved the pre-payment.
The investigator said GCL was satisfied the breach of its company policy had been a one-off and said it would engage external consultants to review and, if necessary, tighten its internal policy and processes.
GCL has already admitted, in April, it failed to report the award of the EPC contract – which has since been terminated – as a major transaction, as required by stock market rules, and has said it is reviewing why this did not happen.
The pre-payment in contention, of which GCL received a 97% refund in April, prompted Deloitte to recommend an investigation of the matter, including the commercial rationale for paying the money. GCL subsequently said the independent investigator would also look into whether the payment was made to a related party. Despite GCL following Deloitte's recommendation to appoint an independent investigator, the professional services company resigned as auditor for GCL in May, citing an inability to reach agreement over the scope of the investigation. Crowe (HK) CPA Ltd subsequently replaced Deloitte as GCL's auditor.
GCL today said the independent investigator “has not identified any non-compliant or unreasonable circumstances from both a legal and commercial perspective,” in relation to the pre-payment made. The money was paid in line with the requirements of Chinese construction law that any EPC contract pre-payments be between 10% and 30% of the full value of the EPC contract and the investigator found no connections between the sub-contractor engaged to work on the EPC contract and Jiangsu Zhongneng.
The investigator was content with the explanation given for terminating the EPC contract and signing a new arrangement with different parties. GCL said the company decided to end the EPC contract in October because it wished to maintain the confidentiality of its new granular silicon production process by engaging with multiple contractors to construct different process steps of the factory, rather than with one main contractor.
As a result, GCL entered a new EPC contract for its planned polysilicon fab on January 8 and, on April 6, signed a termination agreement relating to the previous EPC, supplementing the latter with another agreement on April 25. The two termination agreements reached in April accepted the state-owned EPC lead contractor and sub contractor had incurred expenses of RMB14.72 million (US$2.28 million) by that stage, which would be kept back when the RMB510 million payment was reimbursed.
GCL's stock has been suspended from trading in Hong Kong since the start of April because the concerns raised by Deloitte over the pre-payment have rendered the company unable to publish its 2020 annual figures yet.

According to their findings, which can be found in the paper Techno-economic analysis of balancing California’s power system on a seasonal basis: Hydrogen vs. lithium-ion batteries, published in Applied Energy, hydrogen-fired gas turbines (HFGTs) can currently be built at a cost of $1,320/kW and may replace natural gas-fired plants to balance the electricity network on a seasonal basis. Maintenance cost for HFGTs is assumed to be the same as that of gas-fired gas plants, at around $13/kW, per year, while transport costs for hydrogen are estimated at between $0.60/kg, for a 1,000km pipeline, to $2/kg for a 3,000km pipeline.
Furthermore, the MIT scientists calculated that green hydrogen can currently be produced at a cost ranging between $3 and $10 per kilogram, depending on operating conditions, while grey or blue hydrogen can be generated at a cost of $1 and $1.50 per kilogram, respectively. “Assuming 40% utilization of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer and an input power cost of $10/MWh, green hydrogen can be produced at $5/kg,” they specified. “Green  hydrogen is currently more expensive than grey or blue hydrogen but these costs are projected to decrease on the order to 70% through 2050 as demand increases.”
As for lithium-ion storage, the academics estimated that a 100 MW/400 MWh battery may be built at a cost of $236.50/MWh.
The U.S. group compared the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of HFGTs and large scale lithium-ion storage in a scenario in which the two sources of energy have to meet the production achieved by natural-gas-fired gas turbines in California in 2019. It also assumed that the lifetime of any installed project is 15 years and the discount rate for any installed project is 10%. “The annual fuel consumption for the HFGT is calculated as the total cost associated with purchasing hydrogen to operate the facility, while the annual fuel consumption for the lithium-ion [facility] is equal to the total cost of the electric power stored in the system,” it further explained.
The analysis showed that the competitiveness of HFGTs is strictly dependent on the heat rate of the gas power plants they should replace. The heat rate indicates a power plant's efficiency and represents the amount of energy it needs to generate a kilowatt-hour of electricity. According to the researchers, HFGTs become more competitive than lithium-ion storage when the heat rate is higher. Furthermore, they found that HFGTs powered by blue hydrogen produced with CO2 capture may be the more cost-competitive substitute for natural-gas-fired gas turbines. “We found the power prices in today’s market do not justify investment in this technology,” they concluded. “However, we noted the propensity for more extreme power price patterns within the market as the share of variable renewable energy grows within the market.“

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/14/two-years-of-perovskite-progress/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JULY 14, 2021",Two years of perovskite progress,"After a series of impressive achievements and a lot of hype, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become a popular area for researchers in recent years. And with universities and institutes the world over reporting a wealth of different approaches to realize the material’s full potential as a solar cell, it can be difficult to estimate the actual progress toward developing a commercially viable product or to know the biggest remaining challenges.
Scientists led by China’s Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJT) reviewed much of the recent progress in perovskite solar cells, seeking to summarize the main progress made in 2020 and so far in 2021; and to discuss remaining challenges to developing practical perovskite-based modules or perovskite-silicon tandem products.
The review, titled The Main Progress of Perovskite Solar Cells in 2020-2021, is published in Nano-Micro Letters. The group divided progress into four areas: Efficiency, Stability, Perovskite-based tandem solar cells and lead-free perovskites. Overall, the paper concludes that retaining the high efficiencies achieved in laboratory devices that often measure less than 1cm² is the biggest challenge to developing commercial products, alongside realizing coating processes that work at high speed under ambient conditions.
“…[efficiency] decreases to 19.6% when the aperture area increases from 0.1 cm2 to about 10 cm2, and further drops to 17.9% with the area approaching 1000 cm2 for PSCs, which still lags far behind that of the crystalline silicon cells,” the group notes in its conclusion. “Intensive works should be conducted to precisely control the uniformity of the crystallization process in large-area perovskite films.”
Alongside manufacturing processes, long-term stability is a well-published challenge for perovskite solar cells. The SJT group joins others in calling for a standardized set of stability tests, and the use of third-party verification to ensure comparable and credible results on stability.
And they also note that significant progress has been made in lead-free perovskites in the past year, creating a potential opportunity for a smaller commercial scale-up for use in wearable and indoor PV devices to power sensors and other devices with fairly low energy requirements. “In our opinion, the application of tin PSCs for indoor PV products could be prior to lead PSCs when their efficiencies reach over 15%,” they conclude.

China will continue to show the way as the Asia-Pacific region sees the volume of installed solar capacity treble by 2030, to 1.5 TW, according to WoodMac consultant Xin Zhang.
India will add the second largest amount of solar this decade, followed by Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, and Australia, according to the note released by WoodMac yesterday, but it will be the Indonesian market that will be the fastest growing, from a small base of 300 MW today to an estimated 8.5 GW in nine years' time.
Pick up your July copy of pv magazine today for an in-depth look at solar’s vital role in securing energy supply where conventional grids have struggled to reach. And don’t miss our In Conversation special: Over the past month, we have been in touch with leading researchers working on energy systems, solar cell technologies, battery storage, hydrogen and more; discussing the future of energy and the technologies we can expect to see a whole lot more of in the coming years.
That rapid growth will be helped in large part by a $600 million loan given to state-owned electric company Perusahaan Listrik Negara by the Asian Development Bank last year to expand access to electricity.
India is set to miss its ambitious target of reaching 100 GW of installed solar generation capacity by next year, said Zhang, but it will rebound from its current Covid-induced slump to add an eventual 138 GW by the end of the decade.
Japan will be the region's third biggest market to 2030, despite high prices causing a slowdown in new installations. The nation will nevertheless add 63 GW of solar in the next nine years, keeping it ahead of the 58 GW expected in a South Korean market which WoodMac says is on the rise.
The feed-in-tariff-driven solar boom in Vietnam – which saw 5.5 GW of generation capacity installed in 2019 and a whopping 13.8 GW last year – will slow to 2026, as the subsidies are tapered down but will recover to add an expected 45 GW by 2030 as solar prices reach grid parity, the analyst forecast.
WoodMac has pointed to demand for green hydrogen as well as policies at state, rather than federal level as the reason Australia will add 23 GW of solar to the end of the decade.
The analyst's note said large scale projects will continue to account for 53% of the new capacity expected in China for the remainder of the 2020s but, elsewhere in the region, land constraints and increasing affordability will make small scale, ‘distributed-generation' systems more popular. Smaller household and business arrays of that type will supply more than 60% of the new capacity added outside China in the region by 2030, according to the analyst, ensuring 51% of the arrays added across the whole Asia Pacific region by that date will be small scale.
The installation of 1.5 TW of generation capacity across the region will see solar's share of the total power generation mix rise from 4% to 10%, in nine years' time, said WoodMac, with photovoltaics generating 20% of Australia's electricity by that date and 15% of Vietnam's.

Switzerland installed around 493 MW of new PV capacity in 2020, which means the Alpine country surpassed the 3 GW threshold at the end of the year, according to new figures provided by local trade body Swissolar and based on statistics from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE).
All PV systems connected to the grid in the country were able to cover around 4.7% of its electricity demand last year. This share, in 2019, was still 3.8%
Last year's performance represents an increase of almost 50% compared to 2019, with growth being recorded across all segments.
The increase in industrial and commercial photovoltaic rooftop systems was particularly high. The average size of the photovoltaic systems was 24.5 kW in 2020, which shows a trend towards larger systems compared to previous years, according to Swissolar.
The association also reported that residential batteries linked to PV systems are becoming increasingly popular. According to its figures, the number of battery storage systems sold in the country grew by 65% and around 15% of residential PV systems are coupled with battery storage. In total, storage systems with a capacity of 28,400 kWh had been installed in Switzerland at the end of 2020.
Despite the significant increase in the expansion of photovoltaics, Swissolar is urging the government for further acceleration. “For the decarbonization of the energy system and for the replacement of nuclear power, a massive expansion of solar energy, to around 50 GW, with an annual electricity production of 45 TWh, is required,” said Swissolar managing director David Stickelberger. “Within just 30 years, we have to add 15 times the capacity installed today.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/14/rotterdam-court-conditionally-releases-longi-pv-modules/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,NETHERLANDS",PV MAGAZINE,"JULY 14, 2021",Rotterdam court conditionally releases Longi PV modules,"This article was amended on July 21, 2021, to reflect that the District Court of Rotterdam on July 9 partially lifted the seizure of Longi PV modules, to the extent they have been delivered after June 16, or to a place outside of Longi’s warehousing partner, or upon receipt of proof they will not be distributed in markets where Hanwha’s patent applies. pv magazine previously reported Longi’s attempt to lift the seizure had “failed” and “been rejected” on July 14. The dates of permission to make the seizure, and of the seizure taking place, were June 11 and 16, respectively, rather than June 16 and 21, as previously reported. pv magazine previously reported Hanwha U.S. patent 9893215 had not been invalidated. However, this patent, which is the U.S. counterpart to the almost identical European patent 2 220 689 being subject to the court proceedings in the Netherlands, was invalidated on December 3 and 8 by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the United States Patent and Trademark Office in decisions IPR2019-01072 and IPR2019-01145, respectively. This updated report also includes a new statement from Longi.
As pv magazine reported earlier this month, a shipment of Longi products was seized in Rotterdam after Hanwha obtained permission from the Dutch authorities because of the risk the products could be exported into third-party European countries where a Hanwha patent applies.
The Dusseldorf Regional Court, in June last year, decided Longi – and other Chinese owned manufacturers JinkoSolar and REC Solar – had infringed the German part of Hanwha's patent EP 2 220 689, which relates to solar cell passivation technology. Hanwha had filed the patent infringement claim in March 2019. Longi filed an appeal against that Dusseldorf decision, the decision on which was due to have taken place in April, is now expected to be held later this year, according to sources close to the case.
With reference to the Hanwha patent, Q Cells parent Hanwha Solutions Corporation is understood to have conducted a seizure of the Longi products on June 16, having been given the go-ahead by the District Court in Rotterdam on June 11.
Longi challenged the order of the court which permitted the seizure.
Hanwha said: “On July 9, the District Court in Rotterdam … ordered Q Cells to release Longi's products under the condition that Longi can provide sufficient proof that such products would not be exported to countries where the relevant European patent, EP 2 220 689 ([the] ‘689 patent) is in force.
“Q Cells had already offered this option to Longi … and will of course, immediately release particular shipments/batches of seized products upon receiving the respective proof. However, up until now (Monday, July 12, 2021), no such proof has been provided.”
In a counterstatement on the matter, Longi said: “Longi has offered proof which is to be provided to the bailiff. Yet Hanwha's bailiff sought an unreasonable extent of proof.”
The Hanwha Q Cells’ statement continued: “Q Cells considers the rejection of Longi's challenge by the District Court in Rotterdam as another conformation that intellectual property rights in Europe are solid and can be effectively protected. Q Cells has taken these legal actions with the sole purpose to protect its intellectual property as well as the time and capital-intensive R&D efforts that the company continues to undertake in developing PV technology.
“Our hope is that such enforcement activity serves to protect European customers, who wish to purchase reliable, high quality solar modules, fairly developed and manufactured using fully patent protected technology.”
Hanwha was able to seize the PV panels because of the risk they might be exported to countries where its EP 2 220 689 European patent is in force.
The Longi statement continued: “Longi stresses that the seizure is lifted with respect to all products having been delivered to the warehouse after June 16 and at least now, the decision does not pertain to products owned by other companies than Longi (Netherlands) Trading BV.
“Longi considers both validity of Hanwha's patent as well as its infringement to not at all being settled – which can, for instance, be taken by the U.S. authorities having denied infringement of the parallel almost identical U.S. patent in first and second instance. Also, there the controversy continues. In any event Longi offers a variety of undisputedly non-infringing solar modules.”

The factory, which is expected to be built at a cost of BRL150 million ($29 million), will be tested through pilot production in 2021 and should begin manufacturing activities in 2022. The company plans to reach an assembly rate of 600 systems per month at the new plant, which will assemble systems mostly with monocrystalline panels with a power output of between 400 and 500 W. 
The company already operates two production units in Itajaí, in the state of Santa Catarina, and in Louveira, in São Paulo, where it integrates complete photovoltaic systems which are then distributed among its more-than-9,000 accredited installers. The factories use modules supplied by Risen, JA Solar, Canadian Solar, Sunshine, Talesun, and BYD.
Renovigi sought to diversify its pool of suppliers during 2020, when restrictions were imposed by Covid-19. For the time being, there is no forecast for the local manufacture of the modules, explains the president of Renovigi, Gustavo Müller Martins. “We are always looking at the possibility of bringing a module factory here to Brazil,” he stressed. “But it may make sense if the country adopts a strategic policy.”

He also stressed that Renovigi is also buying modules produced in Brazil from Chinese manufacturer BYD, which owns and operates a panel factory in São Paulo, albeit in relatively small quantities, when the client intends to use BNDES financing to fund the purchase of the systems.
With a business focused on distributed generation, the systems assembled and distributed by Renovigi have relatively low power. “Each system is assembled according to the demand of our customers,” Martins said. “It can vary from 1 kW to 30 kW but most of our sales are for installations between 10 kW and 20 kW.”
Renovigi currently serves the north and northeast markets from the São Paulo plant. The regions correspond to just over one-sixth of the country's distributed generation capacity, totaling 1.5 GW. The regions represent 22% of Renovigi's sales in the country and the intention is to reach 30% by the end of next year, with the expansion of the accredited network that resells the photovoltaic systems integrated by the company.
According to the company's president, the port of Suape, in Pernambuco, was also in the running to receive the new factory. But the existence of a state policy for the development of renewable energies ended up weighing more in the choice of Ceará as a destination for investments.

Through a public call, homeowners will be invited to participate in a scheme that should ensure, according to the EPGC, an investment return in five to seven years. Selected applicants will be allowed to sell excess solar power to the utility at an unspecified rate.
The scheme is also expected to create around 400 jobs and to raise investments in the amount of €30 million.
Although very limited in scale, the program is Montenegro's first attempt to support rooftop PV.
The EPCG is also building a 100 MW solar park in partnership with Finnish utility Fortum and a floating PV power plant on the Slano artificial salt lake.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the country had installed solar power of just 6 MW at the end of 2020. The vast majority of Montenegro’s electrical power demand is currently met by the 225 MW Pljevlja thermal power plant in the north of Montenegro, and two large hydropower plants, at Perućica (307 MW) and Piva (363 MW).

A small Indian ashram on a hill by the banks of the river Ganges now has a new and unusual attraction. The ashram in Tehri Garhwal, Uttarakhand, produces all of its electricity from a small rooftop solar+storage system.
Loom Solar, a PV module maker and EPC specialist, was tasked with installing the system. The array features six 440 W Shark Super high-efficiency panels, a 5 kWh (100Ah/51.2V) Atom lithium ion battery, and a 5 kVA high-frequency string inverter.
The 3 kW solar system is backed by 5 kWh of storage capacity. The ashram uses it to run LED lights, ceiling fans, and TV sets. The electricity produced by the system is enough to run all appliances day and night.
Loom Solar Director Amol Anand told pv magazine that the hilly location presented an installation challenge. “There were no electrical shops nearby. So the installation team had to walk approximately 5 km from the installation location to get any product, if needed,” he said.
The installers had to deal with poor mobile services at the remote site. They also worked amid fears about wild animals and unpredictable climate conditions, said Anand.

The generator, dubbed UP400, is sold at a price of €6,500 and is claimed to have a minimum lifetime of 5,000 working hours. It operates at temperatures ranging from -20 to 52 degrees Celsius.
The device has a weight of 10kg and is based on a proton exchange membrane fuel cell technology which works in three different steps: first the electrons are stripped from the hydrogen molecules through a catalytic process; then the positively charged protons pass through the membrane to the cathode and the negatively charged electrons are forced through a circuit to generate electricity; and finally, the electrons combine with the protons and oxygen from the air to generate by-products such as water and heat.
The hydrogen is provided by external cylinders and its fuel cells work in parallel with a battery module, with the former acting as the main power source during operation. The solution is claimed to be ideal for sailing and yachting, camper vans or other recreational vehicles, and off-grid homes.
“Whether you own a yacht, a camper van, or need a power back-up for your off-grid home, we have a powerful solution for everyone,” said the company's CEO, Ivar Kruusenberg. “These smart generators can be combined with batteries, solar panels, or even wind turbines to create a smart grid system.”

India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has approved plans to set up a 4.75 GW solar park in cooperation with state-run power producer NTPC in the Indian state of Gujarat.
The solar park will be India’s largest upon completion. It will be located near the village of Khavada in the Rann of Kutch, a vast salt marsh.
NTPC Renewable Energy, a unit of NTPC, has secured approval from the MNRE to set up the solar park under the Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Power Park Scheme. NTPC Renewable Energy also plans to generate green hydrogen on a commercial scale at the site.
The new PV capacity will be part of a massive 30 GW hybrid renewable energy park coming up in Kutch, with an investment of about $20 billion. Upon completion, the 30 GW site will be the world’s largest hybrid renewable energy park. It will stretch across more than 72,600 hectares in Kutch, which is an area as big as Singapore, according to an earlier press release by MNRE.
NTPC, a coal-reliant power producer, aims to build 60 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2032. Currently, it has an installed capacity of 66 GW across 70 power projects, with an additional 18 GW now under construction.
The power producer recently commissioned India’s largest floating solar plant, a 10 MW (AC) facility, on a reservoir owned by the Simhadri Thermal Power Plant in Andhra Pradesh. An additional 15 MW (AC) will be commissioned by August.
In addition, a 100 MW floating solar project is now nearing completion on a reservoir owned by the Ramagundam Thermal Power Plant, in the state of Telangana.

Rooftop solar energy will be key to the grid’s evolution to a decarbonized, reliable structure that is beneficial to all.
The time mismatch between peak solar production and residential peak energy demand has driven the need for distributed energy storage units to smooth the peak and more efficiently respond to demand.
Residential solar companies like Sunrun and researchers in New Zealand are learning that the benefits of storage can be improved when storage units are used collectively, meaning batteries store and discharge power from the grid based at times of peak production or peak demand. And the gain in value is shared between solar companies, homeowners, and grid operators alike.
In a recent report published by the University of Otago in New Zealand, researchers took a demand-driven approach, analyzing a per-minute resolution time series of individual household demand over several neighborhoods that contained distributed assets. A trial led by Aurora Energy and SolarZero in southern New Zealand provided data on the efficacy of this collective battery usage method.

SA Water has deployed drones to inspect its extensive fleet of solar arrays, which include 367,769 PV panels across 33 locations.
The state government-owned water utility has partnered with U.K. solar inspection specialist Above, which uses thermographic drone inspections to detect module problems such as faulty junction boxes, wiring issues, string issues, and potential induced degradation (PID).
SA Water will use drone-mounted infrared and high-definition cameras to collect video data about its modules. Above says its SolarGain cloud-based platform will then digest the data and distill it into meaningful information, using computer-vision algorithms and data analytics.
“The software platform enables maintenance teams to locate modules, investigate issues and carry out repairs,” said Above.
Historically one of South Australia’s largest electricity consumers, SA Water has spent the last four years in a concerted journey toward renewable generation. Its invested AUD 300 million ($223.8 million) on its solar project, the Zero Cost Energy Future initiative, which was completed in May following the installation of 367,769 PV panels.
SA Water is now targeting a renewables generation capacity of 242 GWh of energy per annum. The utility's plans also include around 34 MWh of energy storage. Its aim is to get to eliminate net electricity costs, while also reducing its carbon footprint.
It’s not clear how long SA Water has been employing Above to inspect its solar arrays, but Nicola Murphy, the utility’s senior manager for its Zero Cost Energy Future Initiative, said the drone technology has proven to be a useful tool in sustainable asset management.
Above CEO Will Hitchcock said the company has been operating in Australia for the past three years. He described the partnership with SA Water as a “fantastic opportunity.”
“Investing in digital technologies will enable the utility company to increase solar generation, streamline on-site operational activities and maintain its portfolio of healthy solar plants,” said Above.

At this point in Solar 101, we’ve researched our contractor, found our key hardware, added some accessories, and gotten a feel for system costs. By now, you’re probably wondering how to take care of your new 25-year investment!
In many ways, a solar power project is like a really nice Lego set. There are a few components that are unique (inverters and disconnects for instance), but it’s mostly a bunch of repeating pieces assembled according to an engineer’s instructions.
But don’t allow the simplicity to catch you off guard: Your solar power project will need some TLC.
Due to the strategic emergency benefits that solar power provides, the Federal Emergency Management Agency produced a document on the topic – Rooftop Solar Panel Attachment: Design, Installation, and Maintenance. The guide’s primary focus is on the proper installation and upkeep of nuts and bolts, in order to defend against wind events.
When Tesla had its own rooftop fire issues with Walmart, it was likely a result of faulty connections between solar panels. Per the lawsuit, incompatible electrical connectors may have loosened over time, leading to arc faults.
