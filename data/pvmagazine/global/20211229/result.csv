According to the analysis, solar installations on homes or small businesses grew from 18.9GW in 2020 to 25.2GW.
The result means that residential PV surpassed the C&I segment for the first time, which registered a decline to 19.9GW in 2021, from 20.6GW in 2020.
One reason for the shift is cost dynamics. With PV module prices having largely increased throughout 2021, as a result of a number of supply chain challenges, larger PV projects are more likely to be postponed or delayed, including those planned for C&I rooftops. The residential segment, by contrast, is more insulated from price increases, with labor and sales costs contributing a larger share of overall PV system cost for the end customer.
Rystad reports that PV module costs increased 57% in 2021, from US$0.21/Wp in 2020 to $0.33/Wp this year. Module material cost increases have been blamed for the increase, which was further compounded by high shipping costs.
The burgeoning Chinese residential rooftop segment, which had been long-awaited and arrived with gusto in 2021, is another driver of residential PV expansion. While not noted in the most-recent Rystad analysis, IHS Markit said that in the first seven months of 2021, China saw 7.66GW of residential rooftop installations – and expected 17GW to be installed throughout the year. Chinese homeowners and developers, in figures reported by IHS Markit analyst Holy Hu in October, installed a massive 1.8GW of rooftop PV in July alone.
Turning to the big end of town, Rystad found that the utility scale solar segment grew by 15% in 2021. Dampening growth has been some 20GW of PV power plant projects that were deferred or delayed in 2021.
“The renewable energy industry is facing some of its most significant challenges yet over the short term,” reported Rystad Energy’s Head of Renewables Research, Gero Farrugio, in a statement. “But the future has never looked brighter with new and aggressive commitments from governments and companies alike.” Farrugio said that carbon-neutral pledges made at the COP26 negotiations in November are likely to result in “major growth in the coming years.”
Across the renewable energy sector, offshore wind, utility scale battery storage, and hydrogen electrolyzer installations all saw growth in 2021. Large scale battery installations increased three-fold, and hydrogen electrolyzer capacity expanded from 0.04GW in 2020 to 0.08GW in 2021.

Rystad expects 270GW of renewable energy installations to be installed in 2022 – with solar and green hydrogen leading the way. This is despite ongoing PV module price hikes, with the analysts expecting prices to continue to increase to $0.41/Wp in Q3 2022. Rystad says that 50GW of utility scale projects could be threatened by such high prices, “as their economic feasibility dwindles.”
Renewable project transactions point to continued growth, notes Rystad, with 195GW of utility scale wind project transactions having been concluded as of November 2021. This contrasts to just 14.9GW in 2020. Leading greenfield developers for the year were BP and 7 X Energy, and Repsol and Hectate Energy.
Renewable energy’s arrival on the energy sector mainstage was also highlighted by Rystad, with notable acquisitions such as German developer and EPC ib vogt, by DIF Captial, and Italian developer Falck Renewables, which was snapped up by JP Morgan’s infrastructure investment fund.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/29/neoens-204mw-34mwh-bulgana-project-points-to-co-located-renewables-future/,"UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"DECEMBER 29, 2021",Neoen’s 204MW/34MWh Bulgana project points to co-located renewables future,"The future of renewables is a combination of large-scale assets, some of which are co-located. At least, that can be inferred in markets such as Australia where developer Neoen is continuing to develop a mix of big wind, PV, and batteries in states that put in place favorable enabling policies such as Renewable Energy Zones.
Victoria, in Australia’s southeast, is one such state that is seeing large scale renewables racing ahead. The French independent power producer (IPP) and project developer Neoen has developed a series of big projects there, with its capacity reaching 652MW with the completion of the Bulgana Green Power Hub today.
The Buglana project sees a 20MW/34MWh battery system installed alongside a 204MW wind installation. The project is set to generate 750,000MWh of renewable energy annually. Tesla supplied the battery system and the project came at a price tag of AU$350 million (US$253 million).
On completing the project, Neoen Australia Managing Director Louis de Sambucy described its development and grid connection as having been a “long and challenging process,” and one that he was “proud of having overcome it” – likely due in part to the Australian regulator’s strict requirements for renewable projects’ operation.
Construction on Bulgana began in 2018, with the project scheduled to be completed by August 2019. The delay of more than two years in its commissioning was a major headache for Neoen and the project has faced numerous hurdles including the bankruptcy of the slated 15% offtaker Nectar Farms. It will now sell 100% of its output onto Australia’s National Electricity Market.
In a statement, the chairman of Neoen’s global business, Xavier Barbaro, noted that the company is the leading renewable developer in the country. “We are convinced of the value that hybrid assets such as Bulgana Green Power Hub can bring to the market in Australia and globally, and we are proud of our fast-growing expertise in delivering such complex solutions.”
Neoen has constructed and operates the 128MW Numurkah Solar Farm and the Victorian Big Battery(300MW/450MWh) in the state – the latter project having generated headlines in August after two of its Tesla Powerpacks caught fire during the commissioning process earlier this year.
The state of Victoria is currently governed by the center-left Andrews Labor Government. It supported the Bulgana project with a 15-year Support Agreement, the details of which have not been made public, and has put in place a series of subsidies and supportive projects for distributed solar and battery storage. It has a renewable energy target of 50% by 2030.
By contrast, Australia’s conservative coalition federal government has a record of being a laggard on enabling renewables if not outright hostile to them – with policies including the scrapping of the country’s price on carbon emissions in 2014 and unsuccessful attempts to abolish its renewables agency, ARENA, and green finance body, the CEFC.
The outcome of the Victorian state government’s policies has been clear, with the state claiming to be the leader nationally for its increase in renewable energy generation in 2021. Renewable generation in Victoria growing by 3.2TWh in 2021, up from an increase of 2.2TWh from 2019 to 2020.
“We are also proud to achieve Australia’s largest ever annual increase in renewable power, a testament to Victoria’s leadership on clean energy and climate change,” said the state’s energy, environment and climate change minister Lily D’Ambrosio, in a statement. “The Bulgana Green Power Hub is another giant step towards Victoria becoming the renewable energy capital of Australia and achieving our target to halve our emissions by 2030.”
Victoria currently claims a renewable energy share of 32.4% at the end of 2021, up from 26.6% in 2020 and 22.7% in 2019.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/29/lightsource-bp-closes-376-million-in-financing-breaks-ground-on-two-massive-us-projects/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"DECEMBER 29, 2021","Lightsource BP closes $376 million in financing, breaks ground on two massive US projects","From pv magazine USA
Lightsource BP announced that it has closed on a US$376 million multi-project financing package in the US, and has also begun construction on a pair of solar projects set to total more than 460MW, once all is said and done.
The 293MW Sun Mountain solar project is set to be located in Pueblo, Colorado, and the 173MW Bellflower solar project is set to be constructed about 40 miles east of Indianapolis in Henry and Rush Counties, Indiana. While a full project timeline is not available for the Sun Mountain solar project, the Bellflower solar project is expected to be completed in 2022.
The two projects each have power purchase agreements (PPA) in place. Sun Mountain’s PPA is with Xcel Energy, a utility with service in Colorado, and will complement Xcel Energy’s broader Colorado Energy Plan to deliver 55% renewable energy to the grid and reduce carbon emissions by 60% by 2026.  It also supports Colorado’s clean energy goal to reduce emissions statewide by 26% by 2025, 50% by 2030, and 90% by 2050.
The project is nearby to Lightsource’s Bighorn solar project, also located in Pueblo. That 300MW project is primarily located on 1,800 acres of Evraz Rocky Mountain Steel property in Pueblo. It is one of the largest on-site solar facilities in the US dedicated to a single customer, with more than 750,000 solar panels. The plant recycles scrap metal to produce new steel products, including railroad tracks. This project also has a PPA in place with Xcel Energy.
The Sun Mountain Solar project is expected to create 300 jobs during the 12-to-14-month construction period, to be filled mainly by local workers. Nearly 100 of the workers from Bighorn Solar will be transitioning to construct Sun Mountain, with 200 additional workers to be recruited from the local community. The Bellflower project will create about 200 jobs during construction.
Bellflower has a virtual PPA in place with Verizon Communications, furthering Verizon’s goal of being carbon neutral in its operations by 2035.
Bellflower and Sun Mountain were financed under a 466MW, $376 million portfolio financing package. The tax equity investment for the portfolio was secured from Bank of America, marking its fourth transaction with Lightsource bp over the past two years. Debt for the portfolio was provided by ING Capital, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, HSBC Bank USA, and NatWest.

The PV company signed an investment framework with the local government of Baotou City, Inner Mongolia to execute its plans. In terms of manufacturing, the goal is to invest RMB2.35 billion in four production projects, which would see with an annual capacity of 200,000 metric tons of silicon metal; RMB13.5 billion for an annual capacity of 150,000 metric tons of solar-grade polysilicon; a new N-type mono-crystalline ingot factory with an annual capacity of 10GW for an investment of RMB3 billion; and a PV module factory with a capacity of 3GW, for an investment of RMB600 million. Regarding its renewable energy plant plans, Risen has said it will invest RMB14 billion to install 3.5GW of solar PV farms and 1.6GW of wind power farms. Accompanying power storage plants will also be built alongside them. The company added that the investments in its manufacturing will be completed within four years, while investment in its power plants will depend on the market situation.
Replying to questions from investors on Tuesday, polysilicon supplier and solar cell maker Tongwei said that the ongoing project it has jointly developed with Trina Solar for 15GW of ingot manufacturing and 15GW of wafer cutting projects is on schedule and that all work will be finished and put into production in H1 2022. Specifically, there will be 2GW of ingot capacity which will go into production by the end of 2021, while the remaining 13GW is expected to be realized by the end of June 2022. For the wafer cutting project, 7.5GW has already been completed this year, and the remaining 7.5GW will go into production also by the end of next June. This jointly developed capacity expansion was announced in November 2020. Tongwei and Trina Solar invested RMB15 billion for 40,000 metric tons of polysilicon capacity, and 15GW of ingot, 15GW of wafer, and 15GW of solar cell capacity.
Taiwan-based solar PV research institute EnergyTrend has released its latest price quotes for solar PV products. Overall, all prices continue to decline, with PV modules appearing to have seen the biggest decrease. Looking to polysilicon, prices in China dropped from RMB253/kg last week to RMB235/kg this week. Outside of the country, prices were US$33.33/kg compared to US$35.82/kg last week. PV wafer prices also fell, with multi-crystalline wafers (157mm) quoted at RMB1.94 pcs – a decline of 5.37% from last week’s price of RMB2.05 pcs. G1 size mono-crystalline wafers, meanwhile, were quoted at RMB4.83 pcs, 5.11% lower than last week. Other prices include RMB4.9 pcs for M6 wafers, RMB5.7 pcs for M10 wafers, and RMB8 pcs for G12 wafers. Solar cell prices are now quoted at RMB1.08/W for mono PERC G1 sizes, RMB1.02/W for mono PERC M6 sizes, and for larger M10 and G12 sizes, RMB1.08 and RMB1.05 per watt, respectively. The price of multi-crystalline cells dropped the most – 4% from RMB0.75 per watt to RMB0.72/W this week. However, it was PV modules that saw the biggest price drops, with 275-280/330-335W multi-panels quoted at RMB1.68/W, 355-365/430-440W mono panels quoted at RMB1.85/W, and quotes for 182mm PERC panels and G12 based panels at RMB1.9/W and RMB1.87/W, respectively.
China Shenzhen listed company Luxiao Tech said last weekend that one of its solar PV farms in Tongliao City, Inner Mongolia, was seriously damaged by a blizzard. Though exact details of the losses are still under evaluation, Luxiao said the damage – up to 60MW worth of PV panels and related electrical applications – will be fully covered by insurance and the company will soon start reconstruction and repair to restore normal operation of the plant. According to a statement, the company will see a loss in its electricity sales for several months; however, since the damaged panels will be replaced by state-of-the-art models which provide higher efficiency, it estimates positive effects for the operating income of the plant in the future.

“The cell is the first to have been fully designed, developed and assembled at a gigafactory by a homegrown European battery company,” said the company in a press release issued today.
The manufacturer has already secured $30 billion worth of contracts from customers including BMW, Fluence, Scania, Volkswagen, and Volvo Cars, and aims to begin commercial deliveries in the coming year.

Keen to avoid the perceived mistakes of the solar cell and module industry, Europe has ambitious plans to establish a prominent domestic battery manufacturing presence.
Indeed, in 2018, the EU Battery Alliance, which was created a year earlier, called on industry to take advantage of the expected 2025 €250 billion battery market by building between 10 and 20 European giga factories for batteries.
According to Delta-EE this July, European Li-ion cell production capacity should increase tenfold by 2025, with 25 gigafactories planned for that year, and a further five already announced for 2030. This is said to translate into a total annual production capacity of around 591GWh by 2025.
“We have identified six gigafactories currently operational in the EU, equivalent to a total production capacity of Li-ion cells of 62GWh. By 2025, this is expected to increase to 25 plants and a production capacity of around 591GWh, and reaching 664GWh by 2030,” wrote Delta-EE analyst João Coelho in the July edition of pv magazine.
He added that Germany has both the highest number of planned gigafactory plants by 2030 (nine projects) and a planned capacity almost three times larger than Hungary, the next largest. “Tesla, Northvolt and LG Chem are expected to grasp 32% of the total share of European Li-ion cell capacity by 2030, with further potential for Northvolt involvement in future projects for Skoda.”
Northvolt also appears to be a central part of Europe’s battery manufacturing plans. The company, established in 2016 by Swedish entrepreneur Peter Carlsson, aims to secure 25% of Europe’s battery market by 2030 – with an estimated 150GWh of annual manufacturing capacity.
In Sept. 2017, it announced that Switzerland’s ABB had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to supply and support a new lithium-ion battery factory being built in Sweden by Northvolt. At that time, production was expected to begin in 2020.
The following year then saw a flurry of financing announcements by Northvolt. They started in Jan. with the news that Scania, a truck manufacturer owned by Germany’s Volkswagen, pledged €10 million in the factory. In February, it then received a further around €15 million from the Swedish Energy Agency (Energimyndigheten). The same month, the company was approved for a European Investment Bank (EIB) loan of up to €52.5 million to support Northvolt’s pilot demonstration plant in Västerås.
In October 2018, Northvolt then announced plans for a manufacturing plant in Gdansk, Poland. The company said it would have an initial capacity of 10,000 battery modules per year and would begin production in 2019.
A year later, in June 2019, it secured $1 billion in equity funding for the construction of its Swedish venture, taking total funding to €3 billion. At that time, the Northvolt Ett fab, located in Skellefteå, Sweden, had the goal of producing 40GWh of batteries by 2020.
On the same day, it also announced the formation of a 50-50 joint venture fab with Volkswagen in Germany, named The Northvolt Zwei Factory, which would manufacture 20GWh of batteries per year.
Not one to be left behind, in November 2019, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company would build its fourth global gigafactory in Berlin Brandenburg, Germany. The factory was scheduled to open in the summer of 2021; however, no news has been reported on the project since 2020, when Musk published a rendering of the planned facility.

News was quiet for a while, until July 2020, when Northvolt again attracted another impressive financial boost, this time from an assortment of public finance institutions, commercial banks and pension funds which allocated $1.6 billion in debt financing for its Swedish and German factory plans.
Following on from this, in August 2020, French start-up Verkor – with the help of EU-funded sustainable energy research body EIT InnoEnergy, energy and automation digital solutions company Schneider Electric and Paris based engineer IDEC Group – said it intended to set up a battery fab, with production to start in 2023 with an initial annual manufacturing capacity of 16GWh which could rise to 50GWh, depending on demand.
The 200ha factory would cost an initial €1.6 billion and would create more than 2,000 jobs while supporting thousands more in its supply chain, according to Verkor.
Entering a new year, in February 2021, Verkor then announced that French industry consultant Capgemini had joined the project to improve the manufacturing process and that the fab would be located in Rodez, about 150km northeast of Toulouse, in the Occitanie department of Aveyron.

Italian start-up Italvolt also announced in Feb. that it wants to build a €4 billion EV battery manufacturing facility in Italy. The site for the project is currently being identified, and the factory’s initial capacity should reach 45GWh. The project's first phase is expected to be finalized by the end of 2024.

Not to be outdone, Northvolt stepped up its game once again, announcing the same month that it would invest another $200 million in its Polish production facility. The start of production is planned for 2022 with an initial output of 5GWh and, at a later stage, the capacity could be raised to 12GWh, it said at the time, adding that a new research and development center would also be set up in conjunction with the expansion plan.
The following month, the Spanish Minister of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, Reyes Maroto, announced that the government intended to create a public-private consortium led by car manufacturer SEAT-Volkswagen and Spanish energy company Iberdrola to set up the first EV battery factory in Spain. No time frame nor specific investment figures for the project were provided, but the minister said it would be “the first battery factory in Spain” and located close to the SEAT factory in Martorell, near Barcelona, in the region of Catalonia.
Also in March, Volkswagen announced a strategic alliance with Iberdrola to expand electrification in Spain, in addition to tie-ups with Italian utility Enel and UK energy group BP in Europe, as well as other partners such as Ionity and Aral. In addition to the main goal of supplying renewable energy for the electric-vehicle value chain, the companies said they aim to develop a public charging infrastructure network and build up to six gigafactories in Europe, with a total production capacity of 240GWh. The first two factories are expected to operate in the Swedish city of Skellefteå and in Salzgitter, Germany (namely the Northvolt factories).
In June 2021, Northvolt came along with the announcement that it was planning to raise $2.75 billion through a private placement to expand the capacity of its Swedish manufacturing site from 40GWh to 60GWh.
Finally, last month, the manufacturer announced that its recycling program, Revolt, had produced the first lithium-ion battery cell featuring a nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) cathode produced with metals recovered through the recycling of battery waste.
“The recycling process can recover up to 95% of the metals in a battery to a level of purity on par with fresh virgin material. What we need now is to scale-up recycling capacities in anticipation of future volumes of batteries requiring recycling,” said Emma Nehrenheim, Northvolt’s Chief Environmental Officer and head of Revolt, at the time.
Via Revolt Ett, Northvolt is also working on a giga-scale recycling plant located adjacent to the Northvolt Ett gigafactory.
“With construction beginning in Q1 2022 and operations in 2023, the recycling plant will receive incoming material for recycling from two sources: end-of-life batteries from electric vehicles and production scrap from Northvolt Ett,” read the press release.
It says that recovered materials from Revolt Ett will supply the neighboring factory with recycled metals sufficient for 30GWh of battery production annually.

Development over the past year has been particularly impressive, given the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing recessions. This underlines the increased appetite for sustainability in the business, consumer, and political realms with the falling costs of renewable electricity.
According to Kyle Harrison, BNEF senior associate, this upward trajectory continues in 2021. “Through April, companies have announced 7.2 GW of clean energy PPAs, ahead of the 4.2 GW signed in 2020,” he told pv magazine.
Corporates’ critical solar role: Since 2008, Apple, Google, Amazon, and others have led the charge in corporate procurement of renewables. Their action has meant the US has been the world’s largest market since 2008, with 11.9 GW of corporate power purchase agreements announced in 2020. However, other markets are beginning to pick up the pace.
RE100 and the corporate renewable electricity boom: In 2020, corporate renewables purchases hit a record 23.7 GW. Much of this growth has been led by a non-profit global initiative, RE100, which is headed by the Climate Group and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). Launched in 2014, 316 companies from more than 175 markets have now committed to buying 100% renewable electricity. As part of the UP Initiative, pv magazine spoke to Mariana Daykova, senior manager of renewable energy at CDP and its interim RE100 lead, about the progress that has been made and what’s in the cards going forward.
BNEF’s bullish outlook for corporate clean energy procurement: Corporate clean energy procurement continues to set new watermarks. In 2020, companies announced a record 25 GW of clean energy PPAs throughout the world, marking the fifth consecutive year of growth. Kyle Harrison, head of sustainability research at BloombergNEF, addresses key questions about the long-term outlook for corporate procurement.
Achieving game changing growth: Corporate purchases of green electricity are at an all-time high. Pressure from companies, new entrants, and favorable legislative changes have combined to push the market further. Consequently, the business model landscape is evolving. As part of the UP Initiative quarterly theme on sustainable electricity supply, pv magazine has compiled a brief overview of the main models available (see table) and provided a more in-depth look into two of the most prominent: energy certificates and power purchase agreements.
The global expansion of clean energy access: Once a U.S.-centric phenomenon, corporations are now able to purchase clean energy at cost-competitive rates and at a large scale in most markets around the world. Power markets are being amended to allow for power purchase agreements, while alternative mechanisms like certificates and retail programs are near-universal. Kyle Harrison, head of sustainability research at BloombergNEF, discusses the growth in corporate clean energy procurement globally.
Supporting the corporate renewable electricity market: Corporate clean electricity purchases are finally taking off in many European markets, thanks to a number of renewable energy law reforms. Spain and Italy, in particular, are seeing growing numbers of transactions. However, is enough being done to support the corporate market? Hannah Hunt, impact director at RE-Source – a European alliance of stakeholders representing clean energy buyers and suppliers – looks at the forces driving change and asks which policy and regulatory reforms are critical to unlocking European corporate sourcing potential.
Trends in sustainable debt: While sustainable debt issuance has historically been dominated by the Europe, Middle East and Africa region and mostly driven by green bonds from the energy and financial sectors, it has diversified in recent years and is now a global market with a huge range of issuers, thanks to the variety of instruments that have been created since 2007. Maia Godemer, BloombergNEF (BNEF) research associate, discusses this growth and its implications.
Corporate acceleration: With solar declared the cheapest form of power in history, and wind prices following a similar trajectory, corporate energy users are buying renewable power and investing in new capacity at scale. But more companies need to step up. Governments around the world must remove policy barriers and open new markets to competition from renewables if we are to reach the scale of investment needed to achieve a 1.5-degree world, according to Sam Kimmins, the head of RE100.
Different shades of green: Most long-term power delivery contracts with renewable energy systems involve the delivery of electricity through the public grid via off-site power purchase agreements. This leads to a key question: “How do I as a customer know when and if I am really using renewable electricity, and how can I prove that?” Simon Göß and Michael Claußner from Energy Brainpool GmbH & Co. KG, a European market research firm focused on energy trading, address these questions. They note how the development of green hydrogen is an opportunity to create more flexible power markets by fostering the adoption of renewables.
24/7 heaven: It’s what Google calls its “biggest sustainability moonshot yet” – 24/7 hourly matching – a new granular phase of renewable energy sourcing. The pursuit of 24/7 moves beyond buying enough renewable energy to match annual consumption, to matching consumption every hour of every day. Some say 24/7 matching could push up the price of renewables, but others say 24/7 is the only way to drive home decarbonization, minimize greenwashing, and create a truly net-zero energy system.
In January 2022, pv magazine will publish a white paper on corporate purchases of clean electricity. Watch out for more on this in the coming weeks! In the meantime, check out the coverage from our UP Initiative Q1 theme: Agri-PV from Dec. 27 and Q2 theme: Workers’ rights . The Q4 theme: Urban solar, will publish on Dec. 30.
In Q1 2022, we will turn our attention to the rise of e-mobility and how it can complement the renewable energy transition. Specifically, we will examine the role electric vehicles, trains, and two- and three-wheelers can play in greening the electricity grid.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/29/brazil-heads-for-a-solar-installation-rush/,"MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,BRAZIL",,"DECEMBER 29, 2021",Brazil heads for a solar installation rush,"From pv magazine 12/2021
On Aug. 18, a revised version of the 5829 law was approved by the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil. The new version of the proposed law was the result of a lengthy negotiation process. It aims to remove some of the grid-access privileges held by distributed-generation (DG) projects in Brazil. DG systems are currently exempt from grid charges when they benefit from Brazil’s current net-billing scheme. The scheme allows DG system owners to offset their energy bills with electricity generated on their rooftops and delivered to the grid. Law 5829 is now awaiting approval by the senate and is set to be published at the end of this year.
Though initially planned to curb the DG segment, the revised version of the law is expected to drive an installation rush to beat the deadline after which charges will be applied. This is similar to other markets where such laws have been introduced with a grace period or specific connection deadline.
From January to September 2021, 2.2 GW of DG systems were connected, a major increase from the 5 GW that were in operation at the beginning of the year. High electricity rates exacerbated by the worst drought in almost a century in Brazil, low interest rates due to the Covid-19 crisis, and economic entities offering loans of five to 10 years to finance solar projects make solar PV an attractive investment option. The opportunity to avoid paying grid charges makes near-term installations even more attractive.
The new law assures DG projects that are in operation, or have filed access requests with distributors within 12 months of the publication of the law, will maintain their current conditions until 2045. New systems will pay full grid charges, with a gradual introduction starting one year after the publication of the bill. This transition period is set to last seven years. It is expected that by 2029, the Energy Development Account will completely stop paying for tariff components related to the distribution services.
For new projects, the law also requires the presentation to the Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (ANEEL) of a guarantee of faithful fulfillment within 90 days of approval of access requests. Otherwise, requests will be canceled. This guarantee of fulfillment will not be mandatory for shared generation through cooperatives and consortiums and framed in the modality of multiple consumer units (such as condominium buildings).
Law 5829 also includes the creation of the Social Renewable Energy Program, the main objective of which is to fund the installation of solar PV and other renewable energy sources for low-income consumers through the Energy Efficiency Program.
As most developers and end-users will rush to apply to build DG PV systems before the grace period ends, we expect that the annual installations for DG projects will peak in 2022 and 2023, with almost 6 GW of annual DG additions. As a result of the rush on project installations, we forecast intense installation activity in the PV sector that could result in as much as 37 GW of new additions over the 2021-2025 period. This is expected to split between 22 GW from DG projects and 15 GW in the utility-scale market.
Several factors could limit this forecast. High system prices are one major threat, even if the DG market is less price-sensitive than the utility segment. Modules are already hard to get hold of in the Brazilian PV market, and the suppliers of solar components are reported to have increased their prices by 10% to 20% compared with 2020.
High shipping rates and the volatility in the local currency compared with the dollar in the near term are additional factors influencing the prices.
A lack of skilled workers is another risk for the projected growth. The rapid increase of companies catering to the DG market already makes it harder to find workers with skills and experience in PV. A lack of resources can also impact the authorization process with the distribution companies when they get flooded with access requests.
The approval of 5829 in its current form is a leap toward the decentralization of Brazil’s electrical system. In the current hydroelectric crisis, a rapid increase of distributed solar systems can be an important solution, contributing to a reduced dependency on hydroelectric energy in the short and medium-term. The staggered transition to full grid charges avoids the steep decline in DG installations that would have happened with the passing of the original law proposal. The question now is how Brazil’s PV sector and the distribution companies will cope with exploding near-term demand, as a rapid influx of companies catering to the segment also raises flags regarding project quality and profitability.

Even the few lower-capacity PV products still available in the market in 2021 – that is, below 300 W for 60/120 cells or 400 W for 72/144 cells – are now being traded at rates that are only acceptable in the most dire of circumstances. Given high historical feed-in tariffs, such terms are only tolerable for replacement of defective modules in existing plants. In new plants, panels with such low efficiencies – referred to here as mainstream modules – are scarcely viable.
If we look at the value of the feed-in tariff in December 2018 in Germany, for instance, and how much or how little will still be granted to producers of PV power in December 2021, the whole quandary becomes apparent. Whereas we could still expect feed-in tariffs of €0.08/kWh to €0.12/kWh for PV systems connected to the grid in late 2018, in the coming months we will have to settle for just €0.047/kWh to €0.073/kWh, depending on the size of the system and whether the market premium model is applied. And this declining remuneration has unfolded against the backdrop of unchanging module prices in terms of euros per watt-peak. After all, module efficiency has increased by an average of 20% (relative) and individual module output by as much as 25%, due to the enlargement of cells and modules. Thus, thanks to the reduced number of modules per kilowatt of installed power, installation expenses have been reduced, which has in turn helped to bring down overall costs. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly difficult and unattractive to plan and operate plants without a high proportion of self-consumption.

In Germany, the number of new installations has continued to be comparatively high in recent months, which has led to feed-in tariffs falling at a degression rate of 1.4% per month. This is due to the target corridor of 2.5 GW per year, which will be greatly exceeded in 2021 with an estimated 4.5 GW to 5 GW, triggering the sharp reduction in feed-in tariffs. In view of the need to add more than 10 GW per year, this target is an outdated symbol of the outgoing German government’s unimaginative energy policy. As there is a general consensus that the expansion of PV is an essential pillar of future climate protection, however, there is justified hope that the incoming federal government will very quickly introduce corrective measures to make new installations more attractive again. At the moment, the only sector that is booming is the small-scale PV sector, where module prices do not play such a decisive role.
It is difficult to make predictions today about the future climate policy of the new “traffic light” coalition in Germany and the governments of other countries so soon after the somewhat underwhelming outcome of the COP26 international climate conference in Glasgow. In principle, we can certainly expect a very positive environment for the renewable energy sector. Ultimately, we have no choice but to step on the (bio)gas in advancing renewables. As always, however, the devil is in the detail, and it is no secret that the clumsy environmental and industrial policies of the past have done considerable damage. It will take some time for this changed constellation to have an impact on market development and for new, attractive opportunities to arise for players in the renewables space. In the meantime, the laws of supply and demand are at work, and some turbulence can certainly still be expected as a result.
The available supply of modules and many other solar components cannot meet the current demand, a dynamic that is driving up prices. The reasons for this are varied, and I have already discussed them several times in recent months. In addition to supply chain disruption and high transport costs that have made some shipments obsolete, China’s energy problems are now also coming into play. In fact, some manufacturers have already had to cut their capacity utilizations by 10 to 20%, resulting in fewer precursor materials that are urgently needed for module production. This has also brought the supply of fresh modules for the global market to a standstill. Furthermore, it has reduced the flow of goods to Europe, which means that delivery dates are often significantly delayed. The market explosion in China predicted months ago has so far failed to materialize. For the coming year, gigantic additions of up to 100 GW have already been announced.
However, since such forecasts have rarely come true up to now, we should probably not be too concerned about module availability in 2022. According to the sales staff of individual manufacturers, module prices are also not expected to make any more big upward leaps, but will soon stabilize at the current high level. However, producers do not necessarily want to tie themselves to specific prices.
A popular strategy at the moment is to quote free on board prices in U.S. dollars – that is, prices ex-works in Asia that explicitly exclude the risks of volatile transport prices and exchange rates. Vague sliding-price clauses have also entered the discussion, again with a view to minimizing risk.
However, buyers should negotiate the base price well before agreeing to such conditions. It may also be a good strategy to wait until the end of the quarter. Experience has shown that many manufacturers clear out their warehouses around mid-December, so there may still be a bargain or two to be had.
