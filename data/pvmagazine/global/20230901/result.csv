Alpin Solar Ybrig will be the first solar project in the canton of Schwyz and the third large-scale solar installation to be implemented by Axpo in the alpine region, following on from NalpSolar and the solar plant in the Disentis ski resort. Axpo commissioned its first alpine PV project in September 2022, a 2.2 MW PV system on the Muttsee Dam, at an altitude of almost 2,500 meters above sea level.
Axpo and EWS AG, part of the Axpo Group, expect to start the construction in autumn 2024. “Initial partial commissioning is planned for the end of 2025 and full commissioning in the following years,” says Axpo. The project is being planned for an area of around 9 hectares on existing pastureland in the Roggenegg area. The area concerned should still be usable for alpine farming after the construction of the solar plant, the company says.
Axpo plans to build more than 1.2 GW of solar capacity in Switzerland. The Swiss government aims to reach 2 TWh of alpine PV production and will enable and facilitate the construction of large-scale ground-mounted PV systems in the Swiss Alps, 1,500 meters or higher above sea level.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/01/new-silver-paste-product-promises-topcon-solar-cell-gains/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2023",New silver paste product promises TOPCon solar cell gains,"Silver paste supplier Solamet announced a new product this week, specifically targeting the TOPCon cell technology processed with laser carrier injection, that is well on its way to becoming the industry’s mainstream over the next couple of years.
The paste is targeted at unlocking benefits of laser carrier injection, a post process treatment for TOPCon cells. Laser carrier injection creates more micron-sized silver contact points, improving the contact with the cell surface. However, according to Solamet, current standard silver pastes used in TOPCon cell production don't deliver the efficiency benefits this treatment can bring, and specially designed formulations are needed.
The new paste, PV3NL, designed for laser carrier injection, can be adopted by cell manufacturers without significant changes to their process or machinery. According to Solamet, companies adopting can expect to see at least a 0.2% improvement in absolute efficiency, which it has demonstrated iterations of the TOPCon cell technology.
The company said its latest paste product overcomes a challenge at the interface between the paste and the surface of the cell.
“One of the most significant technical challenges of TOPCon solar cells is the loss of open-circuit voltage and efficiency caused by the recombination issue caused by silver-aluminum pastes contacting p+ surface,” explained Solamet Chief Technology Officer QJ Guo. “Based on in-depth research into the mechanism on metallization induced recombination of the TOPCon p+ surface, the newly developed PV3NL solar paste has been specifically designed.”
Thanks to reduced recombination between the paste and cell and an increased open circuit voltage, the paste can increase the efficiency of TOPCon cells by 0.2% or more, said Guo. The supplier also states that its new product will help to improve module reliability – particularly in glass-backsheet, where the industry has reported some early challenges with TOPCon cells related to corrosion caused by moisture ingress.
The company also says its new paste will be compatible with other process innovations including ultra-thin lines, low paste consumption and low surface concentration diffusion processes for emitter regions.
“We are thrilled that Solamet is once again revolutionizing the photovoltaic industry with groundbreaking technology and product in its new chapter after independent operation,” said Guo. “We remain committed to advancing high-efficiency photovoltaic cell technology through material technology innovations.”
Previously a subsidiary of DuPont, Solamet was acquired in 2021 by Jiangsu Suote Electronic Materials Co., Ltd. and now operates as an independent company.

If hydrogen becomes viable, exports to Europe may benefit elites, posing challenges such as exchange rate fluctuations. It could also reinforce a social contract under which citizens accept subsidies while elites profit from hydrogen production – akin to oil-exporting nations in the region. The Southern Mediterranean countries will face greater economic challenges during the energy transition, partly due to higher capital costs, says Arezki.
The European Commission has released the terms and conditions for its pilot auction focused on European renewable hydrogen production. The auction, funded by the Innovation Fund under the EU Hydrogen Bank, is scheduled to start on Nov. 23. The European Union's executive body said that it aims to allocate up to €800 million ($867.5 million) to renewable hydrogen producers within the European Economic Area (EEA). The support will be provided in the form of a fixed premium per kilogram of renewable hydrogen produced over 10 years of operation.
The Newfoundland and Labrador authorities have granted four companies permission to move forward with green hydrogen projects in the Canadian province. EverWind NL, Exploits Valley Renewable Energy, Toqlukuti'k Wind, and Hydrogen, and World Energy GH2 are now authorized to navigate the land application and approval process for their wind-to-hydrogen initiatives. Provincial Minister of Energy Andrew Parsons said the region has some of North America's best onshore wind resources, which can be harnessed to power turbines, generate electricity for industrial purposes, export via transmission lines, and produce and export hydrogen/ammonia.
DNV has granted Approval in Principle (AiP) to CB&I, McDermott's storage business, for its liquid hydrogen (LH2) cargo containment system design. CB&I, in collaboration with Shell, has confirmed that the containment system complies with relevant safety standards through this AiP. The AiP process included a Hazard Identification (HAZID) risk assessment. The system design is founded on CB&I's vacuum-insulated spherical technology for onshore LH2 storage. CB&I said that the design can scale up to 40,000 m3 per tank, with estimated boil-off rates of under 0.1% per day for small tanks and under 0.05% per day for large tanks.
Acciona Energía has secured an agreement in Aruba to develop a green hydrogen valley in the Caribbean nation. The renewable electricity will be used to produce green hydrogen, and the excess output will be used on the island, said Madrid-based Acciona Energía.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/01/solar-for-water-deionization/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CANADA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2023",Solar for water deionization,"Researchers at the École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS) in Canada have developed PV-powered water purification technology based on capacitive deionization (CDI), which is a technique being increasingly used for removal of ionic as well as polarizable species from water and is commonly utilized for the desalination of water with a low or moderate salt concentration.
The technology is also claimed to have low operational cost, enhanced energy efficiency, and less water rejection compared to conventional purification techniques.
“Our new technology does not require a storage media in between the PV panel and the CDI desalination cell,” the research's corresponding author, Alaa Ghamrawi, told pv magazine. “It relies on a dedicated algorithm for the application of Photovoltaic energy to the desalination process, as well as a new MPPT technology based on flow adjustment and not electrical power conversion.”
The system prototype uses a photovoltaic panel equipped with a diode and a shunt resistor. The panel is DC-connected to a membrane capacitive deionization (MCDI) cell that creates a short circuit or applies reverse voltage on the electrodes when the maximum concentration of ions is reached during adsorption.
The MCDI cell also uses the flow rate as a control parameter. “The variation of the flow rate will be an essential factor to adapt the
MCDI cell impedance and eventually the load applied on the PV panel,” the scientists explained, noting that they were able to control this flow rate to optimize the power produced by the solar module via a new algorithm, which they called Maximum Salt Adsorption Tracking (MSAT).
After testing the prototype under different operating conditions, the researchers found that the PV-powered MCDI cell was able to produce 28 liters of desalinated water on a sunny summer day, compared to 24 liters for a conventional MCDI unit. They also found that the MSAT tracking efficiency is 98.6%, which they claim is comparable with conventional MPPT.
“Conventional MCDI cells require more costly MPPT controllers for a high performance,” Ghamrawi explained, referring to the economical gains of a direct DC connection. “The battery cost for each CDI cell is about $200 for a 200AH device. Then, there is also the cost of the controller which is approximately around $10 and the MPPT micro-controller costs more than $20.”
The proposed system is described in the paper “Maximum salt adsorption tracking in capacitive deionization cell powered by photovoltaic solar panel,” published in Desalination. “For the time being, we have started the commercial design by developing the electronic board and the system components,” Ghamrawi said.

The company announced the new facility last January, after the US Department of Commerce (DoC) determined in December 2022 that solar cell and module imports from Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Thailand were circumventing antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) orders on cell and module imports from China. Trina said that this new capacity would be used to exclusively supply its operations in the US utility, C&I, and residential solar markets.
Trina Solar began producing 210 mm monocrystalline wafers for Vertex Modules in Vietnam last week. “Wafers produced will be primarily used in cell and module production at Trina Solar’s sites in Vietnam and Thailand, including Trina’s supply to the U.S. market,” the company states.
In addition to the new factory’s wafer production capacity of 6.5 GW, it has a cell capacity of 4 GW and a module capacity of 5 GW. The silicon wafer factory includes ingot pulling, machine processing, slicing, and silicon processing.
Last May, Trina Solar announced it signed an agreement with an unspecified state-owned entity of Shifang City, Sichuan province in China, to build a 25 GW monocrystalline ingot factory in the area.

Neoen aims to have 10 GW of large-scale solar and wind and battery energy storage capacity in Australia by the end of the decade, as part of a multibillion dollar forward investment plan.
The Paris-headquartered renewables giant revealed the target after announcing that its portfolio of renewable energy generation and storage projects has reached 3.3 GW of capacity in operation or under construction in Australia, cementing its position as the country’s biggest renewable energy developer.
Neoen has in the past decade invested more than AUD 4 billion ($2.59 billion) in Australian projects but Neoen Australia Managing Director Louis de Sambucy said the company is now planning a multibillion dollar spend as it looks increase its portfolio to 10 GW of renewables capacity by 2030.
De Sambucy said the company’s ambition is to have highly competitive solar, wind and storage assets in every state, and to leverage this multi-technology portfolio to design the solutions of the future for the grid and for energy customers.
“We are strongly committed to continuing to play a decisive role in Australia’s clean energy future,” he said, noting that the company already has an extensive development pipeline in place.
Neoen’s portfolio of 20 assets in operation or under construction consists of 2 GW of generation capacity evenly split between solar and wind and 1.3 GW/2.8 GWh of battery energy storage. This accounts for approximately 45% of Australia’s grid-scale battery storage and 10% of both the country’s utility-scale solar and wind capacity.
The company’s Australian projects include the world’s first big battery – the now 150 MW/193.5 MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia – and the 300 MW/450 MWh Victorian Big Battery, which is currently Australia’s largest battery.
Its PV projects include the recently commissioned 400 MW Western Downs Solar Farm in Queensland. Developed on a 1,500-hectare site near Chinchilla, Queensland, the project will also include a 270 MW/540 MWh battery energy storage system.
Neoen said being an owner and operator is a central feature of the company’s approach, allowing it to invest in internal capabilities across the project lifecycle, including its operational control centre in Canberra which monitors the portfolio and manages its market trading.
Neoen Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Xavier Barbaro said the Australian market has helped to inform the company’s global operations.
“It is a model and an inspiration for us internationally, and it is a source of much of our innovation,” he said. “Neoen is a key player in Australia and Australia is Neoen’s number one country.”

Further west, cloud associated with Tropical Storm Hilary decreased irradiance below monthly averages across southern California and the Rockies, according to data collected by Solcast, a DNV company, via the Solcast API.

During August, the Deep South saw a 20% increase in its Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) relative to the historical monthly average. This was accompanied by temperatures averaging 3 C above the typical for the season. The driver for these changes was reduced onshore winds compared to normal, reducing humidity and cloud cover.
In the final days of the month, the southern sunshine abruptly gave way to thick cloud, as Hurricane Idalia moved over the region. This animation shows the hurricane's progression during August 29 and 30, bringing thick cloud from Louisiana to North Carolina.

Further west, Tropical Storm Hillary and its associated cloud systems led to significantly lower irradiance than usual for August, in a broad area from Baja, through Southern California, and along the Rockies to British Columbia.
Despite only lasting a few days, the effect of the cloud cover from Tropical Storm Hilary was significant, contributing to the reduced monthly irradiance on the west coast.
 

Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

Community solar projects are typically smaller than utility-scale projects and involve customers subscribing to a portion of the facility’s electricity generation in exchange for utility bill credits. 
The modules will be produced at Heliene’s Minnesota facility, potentially making them eligible for the 10% domestic content bonus tax credit adder provided by the US Inflation Reduction Act. Heliene expanded its facility in 2022 to meet increasing demand and has additional capacity expansions planned for September 2023.  
US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm and Senator Tina Smith (D-Minnesota) joined Heliene Chief Executive Officer Martin Pochtaruk and Nexamp Chief Executive Officer Zaid Ashai at the Mountain Iron, Minnesota facility to commemorate the order and view Heliene’s manufacturing operations. 
“Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, companies like Nexamp [and Heliene] can make investments that boost American manufacturing and create American jobs, while lowering families’ energy bills,” said Granholm. 
Nexamp and Heliene’s partnership is expected to support additional research and development and create nearly 1,000 jobs in the Iron Range region. 
“The well-designed incentives and the industrial policy included in the IRA will drive continued growth of solar projects and this partnership puts Heliene and Nexamp on track to meet demand with high-quality, domestically manufactured solar modules,” said Pochtaruk. “This historic order also enables Heliene to maintain its commitment to creating good paying manufacturing jobs in the US solar industry.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/01/china-polysilicon-prices-rise-for-the-eighth-consecutive-week/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2023",China polysilicon prices rise for the eighth consecutive week,"China Mono Grade, OPIS’ assessment for polysilicon in the country, extended gains for an eighth week, edging up 2.38% on-week to 75.50 CNY ($10.36)/kg.
This market continues to contend with some short-term bullish factors. The increase in polysilicon production in August was still lower than expected, “mainly due to the shortage of electricity in summer,” explained one source.
Right now, the China polysilicon market is maintaining a monthly production capacity of around 120,000 MT, “with some more polysilicon added from imports,” said a source. This is just enough for the approximately 50 GW of modules on production lines, the source added.
Moving forward, China polysilicon prices are expected to decline as oversupply issues again cloud the market. Current high module production rates cannot be maintained for long, as end-user demand will probably decline by the end of November till December, according to a source. Meanwhile, some new polysilicon players who had halted production might have it start up again in the fourth quarter, which may lead to a noticeable increase in polysilicon supply, she added.

Though this week saw China’s polysilicon and wafer segments wend upwards yet again, the Chinese Module Marker (CMM), the OPIS benchmark assessment for Mono PERC modules from China, held steady for a fifth week in a row at $0.163 per W, and the price of TOPCon modules also held steady for a fifth week running at $0.17/W.
Modules are trading sideways, concurred multiple sources during OPIS’ market survey as the market’s fundamentals remain unchanged. Upstream prices continue gaining, but it is challenging for module sellers to raise prices owing to the intense competition they face in this segment.
Moving forward, oversupply will continue to be the theme of the module market. Module prices are at their bottom and cannot fall further, with tier-2 and -3 players unable to start operations and tier-1 players keeping prices depressed as they compete with one another, one source explained. Smaller players might shut their doors: “Companies closing down are a good thing, as it means the solar market is consolidating and less efficient players have quit,” a different source said.
