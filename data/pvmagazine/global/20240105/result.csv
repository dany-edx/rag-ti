“We have taken a big step forward, especially when it comes to PV, for which capacity has almost doubled compared to the previous year,” said Klaus Müller, president of the Bundesnetzagentur.
The Bundesnetzagentur said that it expects 14.1 GW of newly installed PV capacity for 2023, primarily from rooftop systems. It noted that the state of Bavaria likely contributed 3.5 GW of the total.
Cumulative PV capacity in Germany is expected to reach approximately 81.7 GW by December.
The agency reports a threefold increase in balcony solar systems, totaling 260,000 in 2023, accounting for 1.5% of new PV capacity additions.
Solar accounts for nearly half of Germany's installed renewable energy output, at 17 GW, while net wind capacity reached 2.9 GW in 2023, surpassing the previous year's figures, said the Bundesnetzagentur.
“When it comes to onshore wind, we are not yet where we want to be. What makes me optimistic is that significantly more permits will be issued in 2023,” said Müller. “This will pay off in increasing numbers of new buildings.”
A 300 MW offshore wind power plant started operations in the Baltic Sea in 2023. The North Sea and Baltic Sea now host 8.5 GW of cumulative renewables capacity. Biomass plant expansion doubled to 120 MW in 2023, bringing the total operational capacity of such systems to approximately 9 GW, said the Bundesnetzagentur.

They can be stretched up to 40% during operation, with a conversion efficiency of 19%.
“The team conjugated a highly stretchable polymer to an electrically conductive polymer with excellent electrical properties through chemical bonding and developed a new conductive polymer with electrical conductivity and mechanical stretchability,” the researchers said. “It meets the highest reported level of photovoltaic conversion efficiency (19%) using organic solar cells while also showing ten times the stretchability of existing devices.”
The researchers said that the advancement could affect the expanding market for wearable electric devices, where stretchable cells are gaining attention. However, the scientists face challenges in creating photoactive layers with both high electrical performance and mechanical elasticity.
They presented the tech in “Rigid and Soft Block-Copolymerized Conjugated Polymers Enable High-Performance Intrinsically-Stretchable Organic Solar Cells,” which was recently published on Joule. The tech was developed with conjugated polymer donors (PDs) consisting of electroactive rigid and soft blocks.
“We use rigid D18 and soft PEHDT blocks to synthesize block-copolymerized PDs (D180.8-s-PEHDT0.2), which offer high electrical properties and mechanical stretchability,” the scientists said. “The D180.8-s-PEHDT0.2-organic solar cells (OSCs) excel beyond their D18- and PEHDT-based OSC counterparts by overcoming the traditional power conversion efficiency-stretchability trade-off.”
The research team was led by Prof. Bumjoon Kim from KAIST’s Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.
“Through this research, we not only developed the world’s best performing stretchable organic solar cell, but it is also significant that we developed a new polymer that can be applicable as a base material for various electronic devices that need to be malleable and/or elastic,” said Kim.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/05/europe-should-abandon-buy-abroad-renewables-strategy-says-researchers/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,EUROPE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 5, 2024","Europe should abandon ‘buy abroad’ renewables strategy, say researchers","Researchers at Italy's Roma Tre University have looked at global PV supply chain dependencies, with a focus on China, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and the United States from 2007 to 2021.
The scientists focused on the long-term evolution of trade and technological hierarchies, mapping the global solar supply chain in terms of trade and technology. They said that achieving environmental targets through a “buy from abroad” strategy will have consequences for technological and productive sustainable development.
Researcher Francesco Crespi said that despite recent efforts by the European Union to resume PV component production in some member countries, it remains vulnerable to strategic dependencies.
“In our study, we adopted a perspective to identify the segments of the PV supply chains where Europe has the most relevant dependencies and where, on the other side, still has some competitive advantages,” Crespi told pv magazine. “For instance, our study detects a competitive advantage for Europe in the production of machineries employed in the PV industry, which however risks to be rapidly eroded in the absence of a dedicated strategy to further strengthen the European competitiveness in this segment. On the other hand, we identify the production of inverters as a sector where dependencies appear to be particularly problematic and where urgent actions are needed.”
The researchers have identified growing disparities in production costs between Europe and China in the 2022-23 period.
“Interestingly enough a relevant part of this difference is explained by the excess costs of energy in Europe vis a vis China,” Crespi said. “This does not imply that we should accept to maintain current levels of unilateral dependency. On the contrary, in the current geopolitical scenario, it is essential to avoid switching from a dependency on fossil fuels and their suppliers to another. Surely, the process should be gradual and cannot be realized without a common and effective European industrial strategy that allows leveraging technological and productive synergies and scale economies, especially regarding the development and production of next-generation PV components.”
The scientists based their analysis on trade data from the UN Comtrade database and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) patent database. The main limitation of this approach relates to the level of detail of patent information.
“Going beyond four-digit patents would have allowed for a more fine-grained analysis of the technologies underlying materials and components, as well as a more precise matching of the productive and technological sides,” the researchers said.
A key finding of the study suggests that greater technological specialization could mitigate strong dependencies in the global PV supply chain, particularly in the upstream segment.
“The PV industry is one of the most relevant candidates to apply and test the effectiveness of a new policy approach in which climate objectives, technological sovereignty and strategic autonomy objectives go hand in hand to maximize sustainability, security and growth opportunities for the green transformation of the economy,” the scientists said.
 The research group presented its findings in the paper “Technological sovereignty and strategic dependencies: The case of the photovoltaic supply chain,” which was recently published in the Journal of Cleaner Production.

In the first 11 months of the year, the nation added 871 MW of new PV systems. This is a marked increase from the 496.8 MW added in the first 11 months of 2022, and the 323.9 MW added during the same period in 2021.
However, Gareth Simkins, a spokesperson for the Solar Energy UK association, told pv magazine that the United Kingdom's new solar capacity was higher in 2023 than DESNZ’s figures indicate and likely surpassed 1 GW.
The last time the United Kingdom deployed more than 1 GW of solar in a calendar year was in 2016.
Simkins attributed the accelerated delivery pace to a range of factors, including a surge in energy prices due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He also pointed to annual contract-for-difference auctions, falling panel costs, the ongoing liberalization of planning rules, and efforts to decarbonize.
The latest DESNZ auction tendered almost 2 GW of solar across 56 projects in September, and the nation's upward trajectory looks set to continue. It marked the first time solar capacity surpassed wind in a UK auction, but was followed by concerns that a range of improvements must be implemented to make sure the bids are connected.
Simkins said that there was a minimum of 190,000 MCS-scale installations in the United Kingdom last year, in reference to projects below 50 KW in size, primarily on homes. This marks an increase from 138,000 arrays in 2022, approaching the peak of 203,129 installations recorded in 2011, under the UK feed-in tariff regime.
“So more and more solar going on rooftops, and with several very large solar farms of 800 MW or so in the pipeline, we can be confident that the government target of 70 GW by 2035 will be met,” Simkins said.
Simkins said that Solar Taskforce, a consortium of solar industry stakeholders set up by the UK government in March 2023, is close to completing its roadmap to 70 GW. The guidance is currently scheduled for release in March 2024.

These varied patterns have impacted solar generation across the continent, in particular driving stronger than expected December irradiance in Texas, delivering a Christmas increase in generation for the large solar assets in the ERCOT region.

The South experienced up to 30% higher irradiance than the long-term December average, resulting from a persistent Atlantic high-pressure system driving easterly winds. which kept moisture from the Gulf of Mexico offshore. In contrast, Florida, which is more exposed to the Atlantic, faced above-average rainfall and 20% lower irradiance than long-term average. Similarly, the Northeast experienced a warm, moist south-easterly Atlantic air mass, bringing storms that left many without power and resulting in above-average rainfall and slightly below average total irradiance.

As seen in the graph above, the Solcast API simulations of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) region highlight that 2023 has seen the highest hypothetical production since 2007. This analysis uses the current installed utility scale capacity, and applies previous years’ weather to model how much could have been produced with current assets. This December, Texas’ utility scale solar generation exceeded seasonal expectations, having 20% above the long-term average due to above-average irradiance. Texas is an attractive location for solar in the USA, as irradiance during the winter months is as much as 3 times higher than that seen near the northern US border. Indeed, year-on-year growth in solar in the ERCOT is currently more than 50%.

British Columbia and Washington State faced a different scenario, experiencing 30% lower irradiance due to anomalous low pressure in the North Pacific which drove a deep, moist, and relatively warm airstream bringing heavy rainfall onshore. California saw a slightly cloudier than usual December, with total irradiance of 5-10% below long-term average. Meanwhile, the Midwest enjoyed up to 15% higher than average irradiance, as the low pressure systems in the Pacific weakened the fronts that typically move eastwards across North America in the winter. Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

The converter is based on a GdPO4 glass-ceramic (GC) material doped with praseodymium (Pr) and europium (Eu) ions. This new material, dubbed GdPO4-GC:Eu3+/Pr3+,  can reportedly absorb UV photons from solar radiation and re-emit them as visible (VIS) light.
“This is possible thanks to the efficient energy transfer that happens between the ions in the material,” the researchers said. “When a UV photon hits a Pr3+ ion, it generates an excited electronic state. This accumulated energy has a high chance of being transferred to a Gd3+ ion, which releases some of it before transferring the rest to a Eu3+ ion. As a result, excited electronic states in the Eu3+ ion undergo a down transition to lower energy states, emitting visible light.”
The scientists developed a 2 mm thick converter sample synthesized via the melting quenching (MQ) process, a traditional technique of glass making.
They then tested its performance under standard illumination conditions on a solar cell based on amorphous silicon and a perovskite solar cell in an air-conditioned laboratory with a temperature of 20 C to 25 C and a relative humidity level of 30% to 40%. The converter was attached to the cells with index-matching liquid immersion oil to reduce the light loss.
Through these measurements, the academics found that the converter simultaneously absorbs UV solar photons and then emits VIS photons, which they said is in the spectral response (SR) region of the amorphous silicon device. “Incident light harvesting is critical for the efficiency of amorphous silicon solar cells,” they further explained.
The scientists said the converter was able to increase the cells' short-circuit current compared to reference devices without cover or UV filters, and added the efficiency of both cells was “effectively” improved thanks to the optimized spectral distribution. They also explained that the novel converter may be used as a protective layer in solar cells that can keep high thermal and chemical stabilities in space.
The converter was introduced in the paper “Ultraviolet-wavelength driven solar spectral converter for photovoltaic cell application,” in Journal of Photonics for Energy.
“More studies will be needed to further improve the efficiency of solar cells using doped GC materials as spectral converters,” the research team concluded. “Future work could focus on improving cost-effectiveness by adjusting doping concentrations and optimizing the thickness of the protective layer.”

Bluetti, a provider of both off-grid portable batteries and home energy storage designed to be paired with solar, has announced it will step into the rooftop residential solar market in Texas.
The company announced Bluetti Solar +, a solar and battery home power solution designed for Texas homeowners.
With a plethora of energy equipment choices, particularly with battery energy storage providers, home solar shoppers are often deterred from moving forward by the complexity of the decisions at hand, said Bluetti. The company said by providing an integrated solar and storage solution and a personal project manager under one roof, these complexities are simplified.
“Embarking on the solar journey promises enduring financial and environmental benefits. However, the intricate processes involving research, paperwork, and coordination among multiple parties can be daunting,” explains Francisco Wang, vice president of business development at Bluetti.
With a system proposal software, the company provides customers with a view of their post-installation residence, expected financial returns, and backup duration of their solar battery system. Once customers approve the proposal, a dedicated BLUETTI Solar + project manager oversees the design, permitting process, paperwork completion, buildout, troubleshooting, and inspector quality assurance.
The company’s home energy offering comes with solar panels, Bluetti energy storage with integrated inverters, and a custom production monitoring system. The panels come with a 25-year manufacturer’s warranty, and the batteries are covered for 10 years.
New battery
Last November, Bluetti introduced a new modular residential battery system. The new EP760 battery system allows for up to four lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries of 4.96 kWh to be stacked, delivering up to 19.8 kWh energy storage capacity.
Bluetti said the system has been designed to respond to growing calls for an affordable home backup system and takes less than 10 milliseconds to switch from grid power to battery power.
The EP760, which operates at 240 V, can be integrated with existing or future solar systems, supporting up to 9,000 W solar charging.
“Even without solar panels, the EP760 offers an intelligent peak load shifting feature that enables homeowners to charge the system when grid electricity is cheap and discharge it during peak hours, reducing overall energy costs,” the company said.
The inverter measures 636 mm x 325 mm x 370 mm and weighs 44 kg. It has three maximum power point tracking (MPPTs) with an input voltage range of 150 V to 550 V and an efficiency of 97%. The maximum PV input voltage is 500 V. Each battery module measures 636 mm x 325 mm x 338 mm and weighs 58 kg.

Ambient Photonics will demonstrate the abilities of its first bifacial solar cell at CES 2024 in Las Vegas from Jan. 9 to Jan. 12. The low-light indoor bifacial solar cell harvests indoor light energy from the back and front side simultaneously and can be used in remote controls and other connected devices.
Ambient Photonics said that it can generate as much as three times more power than conventional technology. Its cells are made using an industrial printing process through which proprietary energy harvesting molecules are applied to thin and durable glass substrates to create cells of virtually any size and shape, the company says.
Ambient’s metal-free, synthetic organic dyes have tunable electronic and optical properties, enabling the solar cells, the company says, to perform in any indoor light including compact fluorescent, halogen, LED, incandescent and diffuse or shaded natural light. Designed to replace batteries, Ambient Photonics says that manufacturers can create much smaller and lighter products.
“Solar power has long been an option for certain low-power electronics like calculators or toys, but it’s taken breakthrough science from Ambient Photonics to develop high-performance solar cell technology for mass-market devices.” said Bates Marshall, co-founder and CEO of Ambient Photonics.

With the bifacial solar cell, light power is harvested from two sides. Ambient reports that the front side delivers 100% of the power that Ambient cells are known for, while the back side delivers at least 50% of the energy as the front side.
At CES 2024, Ambient will be showing consumer electronics that are powered by the Ambient solar cells including remote controls from Universal Electronics and a wireless keyboard from Chicony. Ambient is also working with E Ink to integrate solar cells into next-generation electronic shelf labels. Ambient Photonics will conduct side-by-side demonstrations at CES of its standard and bifacial DSSC solutions, showing how remote controls can harvest three times more power than amorphous silicon cells and 1.5 times more power than single-sided DSSC devices.
Ambient Photonics produces its indoor solar cells in a new state-of-the-art 43,000-square-foot Fab 1 manufacturing facility in Scotts Valley, California. The automated facility uses a unique fabrication process that allows it to print solar cells in virtually any size and shape, the company reports, estimating that its Fab 1 facility is capable of producing tens of millions of units a year. Ambient plans to break ground on a second, US-based smart manufacturing facility in 2025 to meet growing demand for its technology.
Ambient Photonics was founded in 2019 and the technology was developed at the Warner Babcock Institute for Green Chemistry and funded at inception by Cthulhu Ventures LLC. The company secured $31 million in Series A financing for a solar cell production facility, led by Amazon through its Climate Pledge Fund, and Ecosystem Integrity Fund, Fine Structure Ventures, I Squared Capital and Tony Fadell’s Future Shape.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/05/training-ai-to-improve-film-quality-in-perovskite-solar-cells/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",VALERIE THOMPSON,"JANUARY 5, 2024",Training AI to improve film quality in perovskite solar cells,"A Swiss-German research team proposed to use artificial intelligence (AI) methods to establish process parameters for low-variance thin film formation and reproducibility to be able to predict the quality of perovskite solar cells.
It required training the project’s neural networks using a supercomputer and labeled datasets based on photoluminescence videos of the thin film vacuum-based quenching step.
“The study employs sophisticated explainable AI methods that render possible to train an AI system for machine learning, specifically deep learning, to detect hidden signs of good or poor coating from the millions of data items on the videos,” Ulrich W. Paetzold, leader of the next-generation PV group at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), told pv magazine.
The videos of the formation of the perovskite thin films contain in situ photoluminescence video data of 1,129 perovskite solar cells, including thin film thickness sensor data and resulting solar cell performance indicators, such as power conversion efficiency. All solar cells in the video dataset were fabricated with a double cation perovskite absorber layer based on Cs0.17 FA0.83Pb(I0.91 Br0.09)3, then a full solar cell device stack was completed.
The efficiency of the perovskite solar cell, as well as the mean thickness of the perovskite thin-film, served as labels for the neural network training, stated the researchers. After data pre-processing, neural network training and testing, the development of a neural network architecture, development of models and attribution methods were carried out.
The resulting models delivered insights about aspects important to PSC process monitoring and optimization that are typically not available in 2D images, such as the temporal dimension, noted the researchers.
“Thanks to the combined use of AI, we have a solid clue and know which parameters need to be changed in the first place to improve production. Now we are able to conduct our experiments in a more targeted way and are no longer forced to look blindfolded for the needle in a haystack,” said Paetzold.
While the researchers note the potential of the data-driven approach to accelerate and facilitate experimentation in materials science, they caution possible limitations need to be considered. For example, production steps can introduce irregularities that adversely affect PCE but are impossible to predict based on videos used for training.
They also note that a data-driven approach “is naturally limited by the dataset used for analysis” and using higher spatial resolution would make defects and crystal structures more visible to widen the range of potential insights.
Furthermore, they warn of confirmation biases and overinterpretation. To mitigate these potential pitfalls, they noted that the team applied a variety XAI methods that tested the conclusions from different perspectives but also performed a large-scale quantitative evaluation.
They also suggest that inference from XAI results be performed by human experts to control against potential confounding, defined as the presence of lurking variables in AI that can go unknown and unmeasured.
The details of the study are in the study “Discovering Process Dynamics for Scalable Perovskite Solar Cell Manufacturing with Explainable AI,” published in Advanced Materials. The research team had members from KIT, DKFZ German Cancer Research Center, Helmholtz Imaging, Helmholtz AI, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH).
The team foresees further development of the technology for use in perovskite thin film manufacturing to improve the quality and yield of production processes, according to Paetzold. Furthermore, the technology could provide a blueprint for information-driven and AI-driven processes for perovskite thin film manufacturing, as well as for research in other types of material discovery. Based on the results of the study, the team asserted that XAI methods will play a “critical role” in accelerating energy materials science.

Cell producers have adjusted their operating rates to correspond to that of module factories downstream, which are expected to be less than 50% this December as this is currently the global off-season for solar installations, a solar market veteran said.

Cell makers no longer frequently receive PERC cell orders, and one major cell manufacturer has over 100 million pieces of PERC cells in stock, according to an upstream contact.
We may subsequently witness two scenarios in the cell market, the contact added. First, cell makers will concentrate on selling PERC M10 cells at a discount to clear their stocks. Second, demand downstream for n-type cells is anticipated to become mainstream soon in 2024.
TOPCon will continue to be their primary technical pathway in 2024, a major cell producer said. But as customer expectations for cell sizes have become increasingly varied, with growing demand for G12 and rectangular cells for example, 2024 may see cell makers continually alter production output for different-sized cells to suit client needs, the producer said.
Perhaps surprisingly, there is market chatter about an impending price hike for PERC cells. A slight and temporary price increase may occur when PERC cell inventories are successfully cleaned out amid low cell operating rates and several manufacturers notably reducing PERC cell production lines, a downstream contact said.
According to a market expert, PERC cells have reached their development limit as their efficiency can be improved no further. Subsequently, cell manufacturers may concentrate on enhancing and expanding the production capacity, efficiency and manufacturing yield of n-type cells, the expert said.
