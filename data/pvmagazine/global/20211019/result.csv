A group of researchers at the Oslo-Base Center for International Climate Research (Cicero) wrote this month that more research on the topic is needed. “Hydrogen gas emissions to the atmosphere can very likely cause global warming through indirect effects. It can also possibly cause depletion of the ozone layer, and impact air pollution. These adverse effects are likely smaller than those of the fossil fuel usage hydrogen fuel would replace, however, it underlines the importance of keeping hydrogen leakage as low as possible,” the team led by Maria Sand wrote in their summary.
Hydrogen production costs constantly increased in the second quarter of the year, and the trend is continuing into the third and fourth, the European Commission wrote in its quarterly report on European gas markets published last week. The growth is due to the simultaneous jump in gas and electricity prices. “Cost-base assessment price for alkaline technologies rose from € 103/MWh in April to € 138/MWh in June (and to € 179/MWh in August, with CAPEX costs), whereas prices of PEM fuel cell technology based generation rose from € 132/MWh in April to € 172/MWh in June (and to €220/MWh in August). These cost assessments were about twice as high as wholesale electricity prices. At the same time, SMR technology-based cost assessments rose from € 36/MWh in April to € 51/MWh in June, and to € 76/MWh in August, being also almost twice the wholesale natural gas price in each month. It seems that alkaline electrolyzer and PEM technologies, through higher wholesale electricity prices, were impacted by both increasing carbon prices and rising gas prices, as the latter is the most common price setter on wholesale electricity markets,” reads the analysis on the second quarter of the year. The report on the previous quarter did not speak about hydrogen prices, rather focusing on all the aspects of hydrogen from a conceptual perspective. The newly released document is more practical.
Budweiser Brewing Group UK&I, the UK arm of global brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev, and Protium, the UK-based green hydrogen energy company, have teamed up to explore the deployment of zero-emission green hydrogen at Magor brewery in South Wales, one of the largest breweries in the UK. “The project would build the first large-scale hydrogen generation system at a brewery. The hydrogen will fuel the brewery’s production, as well as its key logistics assets including Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) and forklift trucks. The use of green hydrogen technology will help to provide zero carbon power and fuel for all its operations, an important step for the brewery to become carbon neutral,” Protium wrote on Tuesday.
UK manufacturer of construction machinery JCB is investing GBP 100 million (€118.2 million) on a project to increase the efficiency of its hydrogen engines, the company announced on Tuesday. JCB produces engines in Derbyshire, UK and Delhi, India, since 2004. “A team of 100 engineers is already working on the exciting development with the recruitment of up to 50 more engineers under way as JCB targets the end of 2022 for the first machines to be available for sale to customers,” reads the announcement. In the same press release, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that UK’s hydrogen economy is “an exciting area that will be essential to tackling climate change, creating new jobs and attracting investment.”
British engineering company Rolls-Royce said that in the next couple of years some of its engines will solely run on hydrogen. “Already today, gensets powered by mtu Series 500 and Series 4000 gas engines can be operated with a gas blending of 10 percent hydrogen. Beginning in 2022, operation with a hydrogen content of 25 percent will be possible,” the company wrote Friday last week. Rolls-Royce said that natural gas will be the primary fuel in the development of the hydrogen ecosystem. “After intensive tests on test benches and pilot installations at customers in 2022, Rolls-Royce will continuously market new mtu Series 500 and Series 4000 gas engines beginning in 2023 for use with up to 100 percent hydrogen, and on a design to order basis conversion kits to allow already installed gas engines in the field to run on 100% hydrogen,” said Perry Kuiper, President Sustainable Power Solutions at Rolls-Royce Power Systems. Rolls-Royce Power Systems is headquartered in Friedrichshafen in southern Germany.
British multinational chemicals company Ineos through its subsidiary Inovyn have announced plans to build a 100 MW electrolyzer at its Cologne site in Germany, part of its €2bn investment in Green Hydrogen announced on Monday. The project, which has passed the first selection phase of the Important Projects of Common European Interest process, will have three steps. Firstly, Ineos will produce green hydrogen to be used in the production of green ammonia. Secondly, it will look to develop E-Fuels through Power-to-Methanol applications. Thirdly, Ineos will sell hydrogen to users in the region. “To realize this investment, government support and a suitable regulatory framework is needed,” the company wrote on Tuesday. Earlier this week, the company announced a €2bn investment, calling it Europe’s largest ever investment in hydrogen-related electrolysis projects. “The first plants will be built in Norway, Germany and Belgium in the next 10 years with investment also planned in the UK and France,” reads the announcement made on Monday. The first unit to be built will be a 20 MW electrolyzer to produce clean hydrogen through the electrolysis of water, powered by zero-carbon electricity in Norway.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Flemish government signed a Memorandum of Understanding on hydrogen. “The agreement will help to identify projects that could receive EIB financing and support their bankability,” the EIB wrote on Monday. “Flanders has enormous ambitions in the field of sustainable hydrogen, from the production of green hydrogen to the implementation of that hydrogen for sustainable steel or fuels, as far as development of cheaper hydrogen production plants,” said Flemish Minister of Innovation Hilde Crevits.
Italo-German hydrogen specialist Enapter has won the Earthshot Prize, established by Prince William and the British Royal Foundation, in the category Fix our Climate. “The GBP 1 million [€1.18 million] in prize money will be used in a pivotal part of the Enapter Campus mass production facility and to invest further in research and development,” the company wrote on Tuesday. Earlier this year, Enapter launched the construction of the Enapter Campus, a site in Germany where, starting from 2023, it plans to make 10,000 electrolyzers per month. The Earthshot Prize is a prize awarded annually from 2021 to 2030, to five winners each year whose solutions substantially help the environment.
Sweden-headquartered Svevind and a delegation of the government of Kazakhstan signed a roadmap, outlining the next steps to develop and build green hydrogen projects in the Central Asian country. “The green hydrogen facilities will lift Kazakhstan among the global leaders of renewable energy and green hydrogen. We are very excited to take this next step in the project development, and we are thankful for the outstanding support of the Kazakh government,” said Svevind’s CEO Wolfgang Kropp. Svevind is a privately owned group of companies in the renewable energy industry, based in Weißenbrunn (Germany), Piteå (Northern Sweden), Dresden (Germany), and Almaty (Kazakhstan). “We believe in the prospects of the extra large scale of the 30 GW electrolysis projects in our endless steppes. Currently, we have the understanding and the availability of all the needed resources such as wind, solar, water, land and the know-how from Svevind,” commented in the press release Almas Aidarov, Kazakhstan’s deputy minister for foreign affairs.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/19/solar-farms-prove-to-bee-hives-of-economic-activity/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,INSTALLATIONS,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED KINGDOM",BLAKE MATICH,"OCTOBER 19, 2021",Solar farms prove to bee hives of economic activity,"Bees are extremely important, not just because my name starts with one, but also because they're responsible for approximately 70% of the fruits, vegetables and nuts we humans consume daily. However, since the mid-2000s a species threatening “Colony Collapse Disorder” has seen commercial bee populations decimated.
For this reason, scientific researchers have been investigating novel land management practices and some of the most promising involve the symbiotic relationship between agriculture and PV. One such study, published in the journal Biological Conservation, examined the economic benefits of beehive integration with solar farms. 
The symbiotic benefits of agrivoltaics are increasingly well documented, and many have suggested incorporating honeybee hives on solar parks as a symbiotic twofold solution to the problems of bee populations and expanded renewable energy capacity.
In the United Kingdom (UK) a team of researchers from the universities of Lancaster and Reading have published a study finding that the value of UK agriculture could be boosted by millions of pounds annually if honeybee hives were incorporated on solar parks throughout the country. 
However, the scientists behind the study made it clear that wild pollinators should be prioritized over honeybees where appropriate when it comes to the management of solar farms. Solar farms are essential to the energy transition and environmental sustainability, but they do occupy large tracts of land and should, therefore, bring added environmental and commercial benefits where possible. 
Of course, many solar farms are located in agricultural regions where wild pollinator habitats have been long-degraded or eradicated. For these, honeybee hives would be welcome additions, providing pollinators that would increase crop production. 
“Managing solar parks for honeybees can have positive impacts on crop yields and thus financial returns,” said Alona Armstrong, senior lecturer at Lancaster University, “But, it is important to consider the suitability on a site by site basis given the potential implications for wild pollinators and the benefits of managing sites for biodiversity more broadly.”
Solar P-Bee
Of course, there are solar farms that already have bees hard at work. For instance, Iberdrola has built an apiary at its Andévalo photovoltaic plant near Huelva, in Spain's Andalucia region, hosting 165 beehives and more than 8 million bees, and another one at its Núñez de Balboa project in Usagre, near Badajoz in the country's Extremadura region, hosting 105 beehives and five million bees.  

However, the economic benefits of this symbiotic relationship hadn't been quantified until this UK study. Mindful of the cost of installing and managing the beehives, the research team utilized detailed land cover maps to compare solar park locations with crop distributions, as well as existing honeybee hive data, pollination requirements and crop values to determine that honeybee deployment on solar parks could have raised crop yields by £5.9 million in 2017 alone. 
Among UK nations, England was the country that would most benefit from honeybee hive integration, mainly because oilseed is so widely cropped. However, the researchers also looked at crops of field beans, linseed, pears, apples, strawberries, blackcurrants and raspberries, and found that the soft fruits like berries would benefit the most on a per capita basis. 
The field crop yields were found to benefit by £2.6 million, while top fruits such as those used to make cider would see a boost of £1.3 million and soft fruits £1.9 million. 
Ultimately, and it is, of course, a hypothetical (albeit an instructive one), the report found that if all UK crops were grown within a 1.5km radius of a honeybee hive housed solar park, the value of those crop yields could increase by £80 million each year. 
“Our study demonstrates how multi-disciplinary research can find novel land management practices,” said one of the study's co-authors, Simon Potts of the University of Reading, “which can simultaneously benefit energy producers, farmers, beekeepers and consumers.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/19/umicore-to-purchase-42000-tons-of-lithium-battery-material/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,EUROPE,GERMANY,POLAND",MARK HUTCHINS,"OCTOBER 19, 2021","Umicore to purchase 42,000 tons of lithium battery material","Vulcan Energy Resources, a materials company that is ramping up plans for zero-carbon lithium production in Germany, has signed a long-term supply agreement to supply Umicore with lithium hydroxide for its production of cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries.
The agreement will see Vulcan supply between 28,000 and 42,000 tons of lithium hydroxide to the Belgian materials giant over a five-year period beginning from 2025, with the option to extend for another five years with mutual agreement. This will represent approximately 20% of Vulcan’s planned output for the period. Pricing will be based on market prices for lithium hydroxide on a take or pay basis, and the agreement is still dependent on the securing of project finance, construction and commissioning of the plants and full product qualification for Vulcan’s zero carbon lithium project.
“Umicore, a leading cathode manufacturer and the first in Europe, will be a valuable offtake partner for Vulcan, as a direct consumer of Vulcan’s lithium hydroxide products. With our recent announcements of agreements with LG Energy Solution and Renault Group, we now have a diversified mix of offtakers from the cathode, battery and automotive sectors, with further agreements expected in the near term,” said Francis Wedin, managing director at Vulcan Energy Resources. “We look forward to a long and fruitful cooperation with Umicore as we progress our Zero carbon lithium project.”
Vulcan is working on scaling up its zero carbon lithium project, which aims to produce both geothermal energy and battery grade lithium hydroxide by pumping geothermal brine from deep in the earth at a site in Germany’s Upper Rhine Valley. Once the heated brine has been used to produce energy, it is processed into high purity lithium hydroxide monohydrate at another facility.
The company has demonstrated production of LHM exceeding minimum quality specifications for the battery industry, and last month it secured a site outside of Frankfurt, Germany for its planned commercial processing facility, where it hopes to begin large-scale production sometime in 2024.
Umicore, meanwhile, is expecting to begin production of cathode materials at its new facility in Nysa, Poland by the end of this year. It is calling the plant the first CO2 neutral factory for cathode materials in Europe. The plant will supply battery cell and electric vehicle manufacturers, and is powered by 100% renewable energy from a nearby wind farm, under a corporate PPA with Engie. Umicore has also signed a supply agreement with Chinese company Ganfeng Lithium Co. Ltd to supply it with Australian-sourced lithium as of 2022, and is expected to cover a significant portion of Umicore's lithium requirements in Asia.
“In light of the accelerating transition to electromobility it is crucial to secure a reliable supply of critical raw materials, that is also environmentally and socially responsible,” added Umicore CEO Mathias Miedreich. “These long-term supply agreements mark another important step in Umicore’s sustainable procurement strategy and demonstrate our strong commitment to support the growth of our global customers through the creation of sustainable and regional battery materials value chains.”

The company says its material offers similar durability, as well as price competitiveness with aluminum, the most common material for module frames, while dramatically reducing the weight of the module.
The material, named LUPOY EU5201, is a flame retardant plastic material, made by mixing acrylonitrite styrene acrylate with a polycarbonate base, and adding glass fiber to supplement the mechanical properties. The material, according to LG Chem, has a low rate of thermal expansion, meaning it maintains its shape and rigidity even in hot conditions.
The company also says it has been able to engineer strong resistance to ultraviolet rays into the materials, meaning it will not decompose or even start to discolor after years of exposure to strong sunlight. “It has the same level of durability as existing aluminum, but is half the weight and has excellent price competitiveness,” LG Chem said in a statement. “Also, it has excellent dimensional stability that maintains its shape even in temperature changes, so it is not easily deteriorated or deformed by the external environment.”
Reducing the weight of a module can make the installation process easier and quicker, as well as reducing shipping costs, which have skyrocketed in recent months. Lighter modules could also open up new areas to PV installation, such as non-load bearing rooftops. “Solar panel frames made of plastic have many advantages that differentiate them from existing frames, such as ease of installation, and therefore has great market potential,” said Steven Kim, leader of LG Chem’s engineering materials division. “Based on the world's best compounding technology, LG Chem plans to lead the rapidly growing solar material market through continuous R&D and investment into mass production capabilities.”
An estimate from the World Bank says that the energy transition will require more aluminum than any other metal, largely thanks to its use in solar module frames. And its production is emissions intensive and will be more difficult to decarbonize than many other sectors.
LG Chem said it has already secured mass production capabilities for its new plastic frame material, without providing details on the location or scale of initial production. The company also says it has infrastructure in place to make use of post-consumer recycled polycarbonate in the frame material, and that it will also review ways to collect the frames at end-of-life and insert them back into the supply chain.
Though it is initially targeting the module frame market for its newly engineered material, LG Chem expects LUPOY EU5201 to find other uses, particularly in the automobile sector.

The author of the report, University of Western Australia (UWA) academic Kirsten Martinus, said that while energy hub development in the U.S., Germany and Japan were all various in their own ways, a common denominator amongst successful hubs was realizing the benefits of co-location and collaboration.
Given Australia's wealth of mineral resources, what the report called “Australian ‘luck'”, Martinus believes Australia holds a competitive advantage for hub development. “One of the major challenges in attracting investment in establishing a domestic downstream battery material refining and manufacturing hub is the competition from countries in the northern hemisphere, who are also keen to realise the economic benefit from locating as many aspects of their supply chain within their own region. 
Indeed, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde this week reiterated the high vulnerability the European economy has to systemic shocks from supply chain disruptions, due to its globalized nature. Many in Europe have seen the global supply chain disruptions related to Covid-19, ethical concerns in China's Xinjiang region (and resulting geopolitical action), and various other economic dominoes such as the current energy price surge, and come to the opinion that energy independence through establishing a domestic supply chain is the only way to go. 

However, the development of a domestic manufacturing industry in Europe won't happen overnight, and even if the continent can nurture its own renewable energy production industries, FBICRC CEO Stedman Ellis pointed to Australia's “strong value proposition in meeting the rapidly growing demand for batteries, and a desire to diversify supply chains and to demonstrate high standards of ESG performance.” These are all qualities attractive to northern hemisphere markets.  
Ellis pointed to the momentum already evident in the emerging technical grade battery chemicals industry in Kwinana and Kemerton, Western Australia (WA). 
However, Australia still has some way to go if it is going to host key industry players in the battery manufacturing industry and move further into downstream production to take advantage of its natural wealth in what is a rapidly growing market on the verge of exponential expansion through trends like EV uptake.
The report compared three case studies of battery manufacturing hub development: 
Image: Future Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre
“The key lesson from the international case studies” the report concluded, “was they did not offer the cheapest labour, nor provide a perfect hub location in all aspects, but that industry and government collaborated to identify and leverage competitive advantages to strengthen regional development.” 
Compared to these examples, Australia is at a relative distance from battery consumer markets and its supportive policy measures are mediocre at best. In order to overcome these disadvantages, the report recommends, among other things, for Australia to leverage its resources, to aggregate production efficiencies through site strategic selection and design, insist upon a circular economy and introduce resource traceability technologies. 

If Australia can take advantage of this early momentum toward establishing battery hubs, says Ellis, it could achieve “a diversified battery industry in Australia worth AUD$7.4 billion (US$ 5.5 billion) in value annually and support over 34,000 jobs by 2030.” 
However, in order to interest global markets in a post-pandemic world of supply-chain sensitivity, Australia will not only need to leverage its resources but ensure the its ESG measures are world-leading. Of course, competition from battery hubs in the U.S., Germany and Japan will have to do the same.

The developer says that around half of the projects could be ready to begin construction in 2022, and that completing all of the projects would require total investment of €500 million. And once operational, Lightsource says the projects will participate in Poland’s upcoming renewable energy auctions, as well as selling power on the spot market and through long-term corporate PPAs.
The capacity is spread across nine projects planned in various regions of the European country, and Lightsource has signed a co-development agreement with an unnamed local partner, which it describes as “an experienced local renewable energy firm”.
Lightsource BP says it has carefully vetted the whole portfolio, and sees big opportunities for PV in Poland as the country accelerates its shift away from coal-fired power stations. “Entering the Polish marketplace is a significant milestone for us, and we have done so with a sizeable portfolio,” said Vlasios Souflis, international business development director at Lightsource BP. “The scope for growth in solar is huge, as renewables will be required to double their share on the grid in a short space of time.”
Poland currently has around 6 GW of installed PV capacity, and big growth is expected over the next few years. The country installed 1.3 GW of PV in the first half of this year, and allocated a further 2.2 GW in an auction held in June. “Poland is facing huge challenges related to the energy transition by the year 2040; ultimately, the Polish energy sector and economy will rely mainly on renewable energy sources,” said Bogdan Kucharski, CEO of BP Poland. “That is why I am happy that Lightsource bp is going to develop solar energy for Poland, supporting our country’s national renewable energy target.”
Since beginning a joint venture that saw British energy multinational BP take 50% ownership of the company in 2017, Lightsource BP has seen its pipeline of PV projects grow from 1.6 GW to more than 20 GW. The company has entered into similar co-development deals this year for pipelines in Spain, Portugal, and Greece, and recently secured $1.8 billion in credit from various lenders, with a plan to grow its pipeline to 25 GW by 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/19/more-sun-for-everyone/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",,"OCTOBER 19, 2021",More sun for everyone,"From pv magazine 10/2021
More than a quarter of Australian homes already have rooftop solar, and there are projections that rooftops and other distributed energy resources (DER) could contribute to half of all grid capacity by around 2040. This level of PV penetration is causing technical issues, exacerbating existing local overvoltage issues, and raising broader system security concerns, especially as minimum system demand drops to record lows in the middle of the day.
In response, distribution networks have been imposing tighter static export limits – down to zero in some parts of the country. As regulated monopolies, they have also been asking the regulator for more revenue to cover their DER integration costs. In turn, this has raised the ire of some welfare groups concerned that non-solar owners are subsidizing solar households.
In response, the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) has just completed a nine-month public consultation process that has resulted in a reform package on DER access and pricing.
Opponents of the reforms have zeroed in on the potential for distribution networks to introduce tariffs for solar exports. Economic benefits from those tariffs may not flow to all customers. Equally important though is the fact that export tariffs would also allow networks to pay for energy discharged into the grid where and when this reduces the need for new network infrastructure. Networks will also be prevented from unilaterally imposing zero static export limits and will need to provide a basic level of exports for free for at least 10 years.
All this has been thrashed out at length over the last year during the AEMC’s consultation process. Even within the solar industry and amongst solar advocates, it has been a deeply divisive issue.
Industry backlash
For some, it has been a line in the sand: Under no circumstances should solar owners be forced to pay to export to the grid. For others, it is a logical inevitability in what is still supposed to be the national electricity market. The reforms acknowledge that where solar exports are a net cost to the grid, that cost should be borne by owners as the main beneficiaries.
Opponents are still hoping that some state and territory governments will block the implementation of export tariffs in their jurisdictions. It is hard to see how they could do that without jeopardizing the implementation of the rest of the package, including the parts they support. And given that the centerpiece of the changes to the rules is the removal of the clause which prevented distribution networks from charging for exports, it’s also hard to see how governments could turn back the clock to a version of the rules that no longer exists.
The Total Environment Centre (TEC) partnered with ACOSS, the nation’s peak welfare body, as a rule change proponent, so the views expressed here are not unbiased. However, several years ago, a TEC discussion paper argued the case against export tariffs.
What changed our minds? TEC realized that, if designed well, these reforms could lead to more solar being exported to the grid. That would be the case where zero static export limits were removed, and people could choose to export more at most times in return for a small levy when the network is congested.
That outcome will depend on how the reforms are implemented, so TEC’s intention is to participate in the detailed design of export tariffs, and the related regulator guidelines, over the next year. The intention is to ensure that solar owners are not ripped off.
For instance, if a network wants to impose a levy during the middle of the day, it should also be required to pay for exports late in the day. And the TEC will be pushing for a reasonable minimum static export limit to be nominated, based on the inherent hosting capacity of each network.
It is understandable that some people don’t like these reforms. Our energy supply is something we can now have more control over in a world that seems to be increasingly out of control, and export tariffs feel like an intervention by Big Brother. Also, the boom in rooftop solar has been a shining light in the darkness of Australia’s climate and energy policy morass over the past two decades, so why mess with success?
On the other hand, some consideration should be given to the logical endpoint of maintaining a blanket ban on pricing DER exports. Should solar owners be entitled to export for free all the energy they don’t need onsite and choose to put into the market, even if it isn’t needed and may require extra network spending? And if so, is it right that non-solar users should subsidize this, even if the subsidy is not large?
These questions have been central to this reform process, but we will no doubt continue to debate them for years to come.

Woodside Energy, a wholly owned subsidiary of Australia’s largest independent dedicated oil and gas company, Woodside Petroleum, has granted Heliogen a limited notice to proceed to begin purchasing key equipment for a 5 MW solar thermal demonstration facility that will use the Californian company’s AI-enabled concentrated solar technology.
Woodside said the commercial-scale facility will use advanced computer vision software that precisely aligns an array of mirrors to reflect sunlight to a single target on the top of a solar tower, thereby enabling storage in the form of high-temperature thermal energy.
Heliogen claims its baseline system will provide industrial-grade heat capable of replacing fossil fuels in industrial processes, including the production of cement, steel, and petrochemicals. It will also enable power generation through the addition of thermal energy storage systems, a turbine for power generation, and electrolyzers for green hydrogen production.
Heliogen Chief Executive Bill Gross said the company’s concentrated solar technology hax the potential to transform heavy industry by “turning sunlight into a zero-carbon source of heat, power and hydrogen that is nearly always available … Although costs of large-scale solar are falling, conventional solar technologies are not yet cost-competitive with fossil fuels in most energy markets due to their intermittent availability.”
Woodside’s decision to issue the limited notice to proceed follows a six-month feasibility study by the two companies and a front-end engineering and design contract that started earlier this year. A final commitment to construction of the 5 MW facility is expected in 2022. The two companies also intend to jointly market Heliogen’s technology in Australia and the United States.
Under the proposed joint marketing arrangement, the companies will look to establish a framework to develop additional potential renewable energy projects, including replicating and scaling Heliogen’s modular, AI-enabled concentrated solar facility to support Woodside’s forecasted power requirements at its global locations.
Woodside Chief Executive Officer Meg O’Neill said the collaboration with Heliogen would help Woodside meet customer requirements for low-cost, lower-carbon energy and support the miner’s decarbonisation strategy as it targets net zero emissions by 2050.
“This is a significant step toward the development of our first facility with Heliogen, which we hope will be just the start of our ongoing collaboration,” she said. “Heliogen’s innovative technology could play a key supporting role in development of Woodside’s zero-carbon hydrogen and ammonia business, which would rely on access to abundant and reliable renewable power.”
Woodside, which earlier this year revealed plans to develop a 100 MW solar PV plant alongside its Pluto liquefied natural gas facility in Western Australia’s Pilbara region, is also exploring solar thermal technology opportunities in Australia.
Woodside said earlier this month that it would provide Adelaide-based 1414 Degrees with funding to support the further development of its SiBox thermal energy storage technology, which stores intermittent renewable energy using silicon to produce clean, high-temperature heat, replacing the need to burn coal or gas. Under the terms of the deal, Woodside will contribute up to AUD 2 million ($1.5 million) for the further development of the 1 MWh SiBox demonstration module. Woodside will then have the opportunity to notify 1414 Degrees, which is developing the Aurora concentrated solar power project in South Australia, if they wish to proceed to jointly develop and commercialize the SiBox technology.
1414 Degrees Chief Executive Matt Squire said the company’s technology has the potential to be “a major component of future renewable energy projects due to its flexibility and capability in delivering high temperature heat.”
“This is positive news for 1414 Degrees,” he said. “This partnership with Woodside is a vote of confidence in our SiBox renewable energy storage and the continued advancement of our technology that utilises the latent heat properties of silicon.”

Last year marked a significant change in the U.S. renewables landscape, as solar power purchase agreement (PPA) offer prices rose consistently in 2020. Fourth-quarter 2020 prices were 11.5% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2019, for an average price of $30.56 per MWh. In the third quarter of 2021, solar prices rose 14.7% year on year to $33.25/MWh.
These prices were tracked by LevelTen Energy in its quarterly PPA Price Index report. The latest edition of the report lays out the expectation that, until new supply chains emerge for the U.S. solar market, these increases will continue.
Broken down by independent system operator, PJM experienced the highest prices, averaging $37.5/MWh. That was followed by MISO at $35.0/MWh, SPP at $31.9/MWh, ERCOT at $28.0/MWh and CAISO at $29.5/MWh.
Since the trend first emerged, the consistent price increase has been driven by shifting supplies of polysilicon from Chinese suppliers suspected of using forced labor. Other issues include a shortage of PV components and new potential tariffs on solar module imports from Southeast Asia. However, solar PPA prices did not rise as high as many expected, which LevelTen says could be attributed to some developers taking a “wait-and-see” approach, before driving up their prices.
“There’s no denying that it’s currently a seller’s market. But, decisive buyers can use that to their advantage by understanding sellers’ motivations and constraints,” said Michael Casey, director of origination at LevelTen Energy. “For example, sellers are currently asking for emergency exits to be built into PPA contracts to protect themselves against regulatory uncertainty … these are provisions that may have seemed outlandish to buyers before, but they could become the new temporary norm until some of these development challenges are resolved.”
Most developers that LevelTen contacted in creating the report (53%) said they are altering their supply policies by incorporating anti-forced labor provisions into their module supply contracts. Roughly 20% are going further in reporting that they are renegotiating module supply contracts, and nearly 30% said that they are finding new module suppliers.
Despite these new constraints, only 8% of developers reported delaying, terminating, or planning fewer projects. This relative normalcy in the face of change may not hold forever, as respondents highlighted interconnection timelines and costs (89%), permitting challenges (52%), and solar supply chain challenges and constraints (50%) as barriers to achieving the level of solar development the Biden administration is eyeing.
“Solar developers across the U.S. are navigating many challenges,” said Gia Clark, senior director of developer services at LevelTen Energy. “Long interconnection queues tend to put upward pressure on PPA prices, as they create uncertainty around commercial operation timelines and overall project costs. Though MISO solar prices this quarter experienced their first downward trend in a year, it would be unsurprising to see their rising trend resume in Q4.”
