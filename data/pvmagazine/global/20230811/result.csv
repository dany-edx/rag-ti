The record heat for July was felt worldwide, with South America experiencing temperatures up to 15 C above winter averages. This contributed to the hottest month ever recorded globally, with the most significant impact seen in South America. Irradiance was also up across most of the continent, according to data from the Solcast API

While most of South America saw higher than normal irradiances over the 2007 to 2022 climatology, a persistent leeward cloud east of the Andes led to below-average irradiance in specific regions. Northern Argentina was most affected by this unusual cloud pattern and saw as little as 80% of the long term July average. Clouds in this pattern were seen throughout the month, and this effect can be seen in the
attached visualization from Solcast, showing irradiance over the continent on July 24.

The abrupt start of El Niño has exacerbated the unusual weather patterns across the region, following from the region's warmest and driest January to July period on record. Cities like Santiago in Chile faced multiple heatwaves, while Montevideo in Uruguay struggled with water droughts, leaving millions without drinkable tap water.
In terms of net irradiance, most of the continent saw higher than normal radiation for the month. The Chilean Andine, especially Altiplano in the Atacama Desert, which has recorded the highest incidence of irradiance in the world, recorded values 10% above normal. Similar anomalies were observed in the tropical part of the continent.

This contrasting weather pattern has implications for solar energy across the continent, with the reduced irradiance in Northern Argentina, Southern Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay impacting solar energy production, while the increased irradiance in other parts of the continent may provide opportunities for enhanced solar energy utilization.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

Minera Exar has signed a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) to procure solar power from a 100 MW solar plant owned by Argentina-based oil supplier YPF Luz.
Minera Exar will use the electricity to partly power its lithium mining operations at Salar Cauchari-Olaroz in Jujuy province, Argentina. The company has committed to purchasing 36,000 MWh per year for a minimum of 10 years, as stated in an official announcement.
YPF Luz's Zonda solar facility, inaugurated in April, constitutes the initial phase of a larger 300 MW solar project, the subsequent stages of which remain unspecified. Minera Exar's adoption of solar energy through the Zonda solar park has enabled the launch of lithium production at Salar Cauchari-Olaroz in July.
The construction of the 100 MW Zonda solar facility was undertaken with an investment of approximately $90 million by YPF Luz. About $63.9 million of the funds were secured by issuing a green bond. Construction started in February 2022, and the plant features 170,880 bifacial panels spanning 200 hectares, with a capacity factor of 36%.
Minera Exar is a collaborative venture between Lithium Americas Corp, Ganfeng Lithium, and Jujuy Energía y Minería Sociedad del Estado (Jemse).
The broader $1 billion Cauchari-Olaroz project aims to establish an initial lithium production facility capable of producing 40,000 tons per year. Preparations are already underway for a subsequent phase to expand production capacity by an additional 20,000 tons per year.

The team, led by the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT) and Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, addressed challenges posed by the non-radiative recombination of photogenerated carriers and sluggish reaction kinetics of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting by creating a novel Fe-doped Ni3S2/Ni foil/OHP photoanode. The group said that this involved synthesizing a Fe-doped Ni3S2 catalyst for OER on Ni foil, fabricating OHP photovoltaic cells with SnO2 electron transport layers (ETLs), and combining them to produce the photoanode. The researchers achieved an applied bias photon-to-current efficiency of 12.79% for the fabricated photoanodes and improved stability by adding glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride (GTMACl) to the anode.
China’s National Standards Committee, along with the National Energy Administration and five other departments, has issued the “Hydrogen Energy Industry Standard System Construction Guidelines” to establish a national-level standard system across the entire hydrogen industrial chain. The guidelines cover issues related to safety, hydrogen preparation, storage and transmission, refueling, and applications.
The German government has allocated €211.8 billion ($232.9 billion) to promote the energy transition and climate protection from 2024 to 2027. Approximately €63.5 billion will be used to alleviate the burden on citizens and companies, around €60.7 billion will support building subsidies, and about €18.6 billion will foster hydrogen industry development. Around €13.8 billion will advance electromobility, and €12.5 billion will enhance rail infrastructure, said the German government.
LNVG, the world's first company to employ hydrogen trains, says that it will replace all diesel trains between the Ems and Elbe rivers in Germany with battery-powered trains. Lower Saxony Transport Minister Olaf Lies said that by 2029, 102 new multiple-unit trains with battery technology will be introduced, gradually phasing out diesel fleets. Battery-operated trains are advantageous due to reduced infrastructure requirements, eliminating the need for overhead contact wires along the entire route.

A University of Seville research team has developed a bioclimatic bus stop that can lower surrounding temperatures by up to 20 C.
The system features four primary components: an underground cistern for nighttime water storage, a closed circuit that circulates water during peak heat, a top unit with solar panels providing energy for water pumping, and temperature sensors with pedestrian detection.
Upon detecting people, the bus stop activates its cooling mechanism, circulating water within the structure to expel cold air through tiny pores, similar in size to chickpeas, on the canopy's surface. This cooling process lasts for 10 to 20 minutes, which aligns with typical bus wait times.
“It's not like an air conditioner, which produces cold air; the structure of the bus stop emits freshness, as is the case with refrigerators,” said lead author José Sánchez. “Although it consists of more elements, its production is cheaper than common bus stops.”
The researchers said thgey will continue to develop “smart” parasols and canopies to improve the design of these bus stops and to build pergolas that serve as a bioclimatic shelter for children in the schoolyards.
“We are installing a 1,000-square-meter roof at the Arias Montano school in Seville to block the sun and create a cool thermal sensation,” Sánchez said. “The children will be able to play and teach outside even in the hottest moments of the school period.”
The researchers presented the system in “Thermal conditioning of short-term stays. Radiant solution in a bus stop in Seville,” which was recently published in Science Talks.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/11/prices-of-chinas-pv-upstream-segments-rise-module-prices-hold-steady-amid-bearish-sentiments/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"AUGUST 11, 2023","Prices of China’s PV upstream segments rise, module prices hold steady amid bearish sentiments","China Mono Grade, OPIS’ assessment for polysilicon price in the country, increased for a fifth week running, edging up 0.95% to CNY69.29 ($9.58)/kg. China's polysilicon notches up toward the psychologically significant figure of CNY70/kg in a week that saw higher price quotes and lower-than-expected polysilicon output.

The main reason for lower output is the expected maintenance of polysilicon factories during the summer, explained one source. The unexpected reason affecting output is the reduced pace at which overall production capacity is increasing, the source added. Current polysilicon prices mean companies have “no incentive to burn money and speed up” the rate at which they increase production capacity, he further explained.
Wafer prices increased this week as polysilicon prices upstream keep rising and wafer demand from cell manufacturers downstream remains high. Mono M10 wafer prices climbed slightly by 1.11% week to week to $0.364 per piece (pc).
The demand for wafers is being ensured by downstream cell producers’ strong operating rates, according to sources. Additionally, there has been an upward trend in the price of cells, which in turn supports the rise in wafer prices.
The price of Mono M10 cells increased as well this week, rising 0.32% week to week to $0.0942 per W. The low inventory of cells and the high demand for cells from module producers are what keep the price of cells strong. Given that high cell prices haven't yet stopped module manufacturers from placing orders for cells or resulted in lower operating rates for module factories, a source even predicts additional price increases for cells.
The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), the OPIS benchmark assessment for Mono PERC modules from China, held steady for a second week running at $0.163 per W in a market where participants continue to weigh the difficulty of raising module prices against growing upstream costs. The price of TOPCon modules likewise stayed at $0.170/W for a second consecutive week.
Concerns about the intense competition in the module market recurred during OPIS’ weekly survey. The production capacity of modules continues to expand, with “the fight over price being very serious” as many new entrants try to quickly expand their market share and existing companies seek to increase their performance growth requirements, according to one source.
Demand fluctuates in different ways depending on the export market in question but generally speaking, China exported too many modules in the first half of the year, according to a market veteran who added that module inventories are building and will keep doing so as China continues exporting a large amount of modules in the third quarter. This accumulated inventory will only decrease at the beginning of the fourth quarter, he also said.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities.

Rio Tinto said the new solar power plant will feature more than 6,600 bifacial PV panels. They will generate energy from direct sunlight and from the light that reflects off the snow. It is expected the facility will generate approximately 4.2 GWh of clean energy per year, or up to 25% of Diavik’s power needs.
Diavik Diamond Mine President and Chief Operating Officer Angela Bigg said the solar plant will significantly expand the operation’s existing renewable energy generation, which already features a wind-diesel hybrid power facility that has a capacity of 55.4 MW.
“We will be significantly increasing our renewable power generation with the largest solar power plant in Canada’s northern territories,” she said. “The combination of solar and wind power will work well together as solar is more predictable than wind, but wind can generate power at all times of the day. Having both will provide more consistent renewable generation.”
Rio Tinto, which is targeting net zero emissions across its global operations by 2050, expects the solar plant to reduce diesel consumption at the Diavik site by approximately 1 million liters per year and reduce carbon emissions by 2,900 tons.
Construction of the solar plant is expected to start in the coming weeks, with the facility scheduled to be fully operational in the first half of 2024. The project is supported by more than CAD 3.6 million ($2.7 million) in funding from the Canadian government.

Maxeon Solar Technologies has chosen Albuquerque, New Mexico, as the location for its first US factory. The new 3 GW facility will produce TOPCon PV-silicon cell technology and Maxeon’s proprietary shingled-cell Performance Line solar modules.
The company said the facility will produce millions of solar modules per year for the growing utility-scale and distributed-generation markets in the United States.
“This private investment shows how our state programs, paired with President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, have charted a path for New Mexico as a leader in growing the clean energy economy and creating a strong workforce for the future,” said New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham.
Total investment in the project is expected to surpass $1 billion, Maxeon said. The company is currently in the due diligence stage of its loan application and site selection is an important milestone in completing this process with US Department of Energy’s (DoE) Loan Programs Office.
“Thanks to the support of the Biden administration, the US is now poised to re-shore and scale up a domestic solar supply chain,” said Maxeon CEO Bill Mulligan. “We see tremendous opportunity to help the country advance its clean energy agenda while generating strong local economic impact.”
Maxeon selected a 160-acre site located in the community of Mesa Del Sol, and it will include solar cell fabrication, panel assembly, a warehouse, and administrative offices. Maxeon reports that its new plant is expected to be the first large-scale cell and module manufacturing in New Mexico. While 3 GW is the planned capacity, the company said there’s a chance it will increase it to 4.5 GW in the future.
