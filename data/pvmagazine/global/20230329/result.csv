The new net billing system replaced the net metering scheme, which was the country’s key PV deployment engine since its introduction in 2016.
According to IEO, the first effects on prosumers were evident in last year’s installation figures, but the impact of the change on investors and installers is still unclear. About 1.3 GW of micro-installation PV capacity was connected in the first quarter of 2022. Around 152,000 systems were installed with an average power of 8.3 kW. This equaled approximately 1,700 installations per day. Following the switch to net billing, this number dropped to 375 MW in  the third quarter.
“The net billing system has slowed down the development of prosumer installations, but not because it is a bad solution,” said IEO. “It was about accepting and learning new rules by installers and prosumers, as well as understanding it by banks and financing institutions.”
It also points to the positive effects of the net billing regime, including better dimensioning of PV installations and investments in additional equipment to enable the use of surplus solar energy, such as heat pumps and battery energy storage systems.
According to IEO, the new net-billing system leads to a higher self-consumption rate. It said that under the net billing system, with the support of the Mój prąd (My Electricity) rebate program, prosumers with investments in small PV installations of 4 kW to 5 kW will obtain a better internal rate of return (IRR) of 19% to 25%. The net-metering regime offered an IRR of just 13% to 14%.
Under the old net-metering rules, owners of PV systems with capacities below 10 kW could inject up to 80% of their power into the grid, while PV systems ranging in size from 10 kW to 50 kW were allowed to feed up to 70% of their electricity into the grid. Under the new net-billing rules, prosumers have to prepare a bill that includes the energy they generated. The price is then calculated according to a special model related to the price of a kilowatt-hour during so-called “day-ahead trading.”
Prosumers account for almost 80% of the installed PV capacity in Poland. At the end of last year, the number of prosumers exceeded 1.2 million, and the total capacity of their installations amounted to more than 9.3 GW. This means that the average power of a micro-installation is 7.6 kW.
The IEO power forecast assumes that the cumulative PV capacity in the country will stand at 20 GW in 2025. By 2030, this figure should reach 29 GW, including 15 GW of power in prosumer sources, including 4 GW of PV systems owned by businesses.

The pictures show an array with at least 100 solar panels that are apparently still linked together via the floating structures.
According to local media outlet Line, Hong Kong's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department is currently investigating where the PV system came from and how it could have ended up on this beach. So far, nobody has claimed the PV asset.
Several members of Kitti Green World's Facebook group are blaming the appearance of the array on illegal waste disposal. It is more likely, however, that the PV system lost its anchoring and has been drawn by sea currents from another location to the two beaches located at the Sha Chau and Lung Kwu Chau Marine Park, which is situated on open waters on the western side of Hong Kong.

It will be available from April 2023. The Austria-based heat pump manufacturer said the new heat pump is designed for retrofit installations and new buildings, including residential homes and hotels.
“Like almost all of our heat pumps, the iDM AERO ALM heat pump also works with radiators without any problems,” iDM says on its website. “The decisive factor is the selection of the right output size and the right heat pump for the property.”
The heat pump can continuously modulate its heating output, controlled by an inverter. It comes in versions with outputs between 2 kW and 8 kW, 4 kW and 12 kW, 6 kW and 15 kW, and 10 kW and 24 kW. The Max version has a heating output between 10 kW and 50 kW.
“In combination with an hourly variable electricity tariff, [the iDM AERO ALM] automatically fetches the electricity prices for the next day and optimizes consumption, without any loss of comfort,” iDM claims. “If you have a PV system, electricity is preferably consumed when it is available from your own system.”
The smallest version measures 960 mm x 1,600 mm x 800 mm and weighs 240 kg. The Max variant measures 1,514 mm x 3,748 mm x 1,005 mm and weighs 996 kg. The coefficient of performance (COP) to heat water to 35 C varies between 4.43 for the 10 kW to 50 kW version and 4.86 for the 10 kW to 24 kW unit. The pumps can purportedly produce hot water up to 70 C.
iDM’s energy management software Navigator 2.0 facilitates the integration of the heat pump with PV and storage projects. Some of its functionalities can be voice-controlled, according to the company.

Investment barriers are becoming the biggest hurdle to meeting the world's 1.5 C climate target. To achieve this, global investments in the energy transition must quadruple to more than €5 trillion ($5.42 trillion).
This is one of IRENA's main conclusions in the World Energy Transition Outlook, which the agency presented at the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue this week in Germany.
“Two years ago we said that the window of opportunity was closing,” said IRENA Director-General Francesco La Camera. “Last year we called for a dramatic change in the way we use energy and this year we see no reason for more optimism.”
In 2022, the share of renewable energy in the global electricity mix exceeded the 80% mark.
“But that's the only positive graphic I show,” said La Camera during the opening press conference for the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue, which is held every year at the German Federal Foreign Office in Berlin to bring together policymakers and renewable energy companies from all over the world.
IRENA said the current growth rate is not enough to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. By 2030, the share of fossil fuels must be reduced from 79% in 2020 to 60%. To do this, the annual increase in renewable energy would have to be tripled.
It is not just a matter of expanding generation capacity, as all countries must be involved. A major challenge is to address investment inequality. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock also noted such inequalities and said that interest rates for investments in some countries are sometimes four times higher than in Germany.
“That's unfair,” said Baerbock, adding that leading G-7 economies have initiated the establishment of a fund at the World Bank for climate investments.
However, investments in renewable energy need companies and electricity buyers, and not just capital.
“Development must therefore go hand in hand with investment in renewables,” said La Camera.
Kenyan President William Ruto echoed similar sentiments.
“Unlike in Europe, Africa must first increase demand,” Ruto said, noting that Africa has enormous potential with electricity generation from renewable energy and a young population, Europe, on the other hand, cannot cover its energy requirements alone.
Baerbock said the world should not repeat the mistakes of the past, when countries were treated as pure raw material suppliers. She noted the example of lithium mining in Chile. Currently, a large amount of global lithium supplies come from Chile. Baerbock noted that 78% of that output goes to China, which she argued is the opposite of supply chain diversification.
“The decisions we make now will affect hundreds of millions of people over the next 1,000 years,” said German State Secretary Jennifer Morgan.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/29/czechia-refills-rooftop-pv-rebate-pot/,"FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,CZECHIA",MARIJA MAISCH,"MARCH 29, 2023",Czechia refills rooftop PV rebate pot,"The Czech Ministry of the Environment has revealed that it has secured new funds from the European Union for its New Green Savings program. It has unveiled plans to cut red tape and bring more households into the program from September.
The urgency of last year’s energy crisis resulted in enormous interest in energy-saving subsidies. The CZK 19 billion earmarked from the National Recovery Plan to finance the New Green Savings program were used up two years earlier than planned.
“Just in the last year and a half, from October 2021, a record 110,000 households applied for a subsidy. This far exceeded the total number of applications received in the previous seven years of the program,” said Minister of the Environment Petr Hladik. “For example, we have seen a threefold year-on-year increase in PV rebate demand.”
Since its launch in 2014, the New Green Savings program has supported 180,000 households to the tune of CZK 22 billion. Its original focus was on energy savings in the residential sector through the renovation and construction of low-energy family and apartment buildings. However, most of the funding is now being used for rooftop PV rebates. 
The Czech government managed to negotiate an additional CZK 55 billion from the Modernization Fund, which was set up by the European Union in 2021 to help 10 member states upgrade grids and meet 2030 energy targets. To date, resources in the Modernization Fund were available solely for utility-scale PV in Czechia.
According to the Czech government, the revamped program will bring many improvements. The process from submission to subsidy payments will be simplified. Some criteria will be relaxed, and the obligation to submit invoices and project documentation will be removed.
Furthermore, the new program should make subsidies under the New Green Savings Light more readily available for vulnerable groups, including senior citizens and low-income households. Subsidies for more demanding home modifications will be automatically increased. Regarding new builds, support will be directed towards buildings in which the effect of energy savings would be the highest. On top of that, subsidies to replace old gas boilers with heat pumps will be offered, including grants for retrofit installations up to €5,701.
After a short technical and operational break necessary to implement the new procedures, the program will relaunch in September. All applicant with projects in progress, according to existing conditions, are recommended to submit their applications by June 30. The detailed conditions of support in the revamped program will be gradually introduced in the coming months, said the ministry.
Jan Krcmar, chairman of the Czech Solar Association (CSA), said the transition is expected to run smoothly and no rush in applications is expected by the end of June.
“We welcome this greatly, but we also hope that the updated program will be able to react to the current situation in the market,” Krcmar told pv magazine. “Grid bottlenecks currently mean that in some regions customers can only connect new PV without any surplus energy being fed into the grid and are experiencing long waiting times for PV to be connected, sometimes more than half a year.”
As the payout of the rebate is linked to the connection, many customers wait almost a year to receive the money. This has a knock-on effect on installers, who are usually fully paid only after the rebate has been settled, explained Krcmar.

India's cumulative PV installations hit 64.38 GW at the end of February, according to the latest figures from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). The total includes ground-mount, rooftop, hybrid solar component, and off-grid installations.
The state of Rajasthan led in terms of PV capacity additions, accounting for 16.4 GW of the cumulative installations, or 26% of the total. Gujarat ranks second with 8.9 GW of PV, followed by Karnataka with 8.1 GW. The three states together account for more than 50% of India's cumulative installed solar capacity.
The MNRE is implementing a range of schemes to promote solar energy in the country, including the Rooftop Solar Programme Phase-II, PM-KUSUM scheme for farmers, and the Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) Scheme Phase-II for grid-connected solar power projects by the government producers. It is also promoting the Solar Park Scheme, Green Energy Corridor Scheme (for development of intra-state transmission system for RE projects), and the production-linked incentive scheme for high-efficiency solar modules.
The PM-KUSUM scheme is demand-driven and open for all farmers for implementation, in line with guidelines issued for the scheme. The nation had installed 1,140 MW of cumulative solar capacity under this scheme by Feb. 28.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/29/greece-launches-e200-million-residential-solar-plus-battery-subsidy-scheme-2/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,GREECE",ILIAS TSAGAS,"MARCH 29, 2023",Greece launches €200 million residential solar-plus-battery subsidy scheme,"From April, Greek households and farmers will be able to apply for public pandemic recovery funds to cover the purchase and installation of small PV arrays and energy storage systems, according to a recent statement by Greek Energy Minister Kostas Skrekas. Households will be able to obtain up to €16,000 each, while farmers can request up to €10,000 to cover such costs, said Skrekas, noting that the incentives will vary according to considerations such as capacity and the income levels of applicants.
Households and farming operations can install up to 10.8 kW of PV capacity and 10.8 kWh of battery storage. For residential users, battery installations will be considered mandatory, and must not have less capacity less than the photovoltaic arrays. However, farmers applying for subsidies will be free to decide on their own whether they wish to install batteries.
Rooftop and ground-mounted systems will be eligible for the subsidies. The program will also cover summer homes, but each applicant can claim funds for just one residential installation.
Greece’s new solar-plus-storage scheme has a €200 million budget, which stems from the country’s post-pandemic recovery plan. Of this, €35 million of funds are for vulnerable households facing energy poverty. About €85 million will be allocated to families with annual incomes up to €40,000 and single-person households with annual incomes up to €20,000. Families with annual incomes higher than €40,000, or individuals with incomes higher than €20,000 will claim funds from a €50 million subsidy pot. In addition, the government has established a separate €30 million subsidy pot for farmers.
The new scheme can cover between 20% to 65% of PV system costs, depending on the subsidy pot. For batteries, the first two subsidy pots will cover 100% of battery purchases and installation. The third and fourth subsidy pots will cover 90% of the battery costs. There is also a 10% subsidy bonus for disabled Greeks, single-parent families, and families with many children.
The subsidy levels show that the government is very keen on battery installations. One of the main reasons for this is the grid’s struggle to accommodate new renewable power capacity.
Greece’s distribution grid operator, Hedno, has stopped accepting new requests to connect plants to its network since last year, and this is not set to change any time soon. The only exceptions to this are net-metering installations, for which Hedno has freed up about 2 GW of grid space. The 2 GW of grid space is available for small PV systems up to 10 kW in size, and will be offered on a first-come, first-served basis. About 40& of this will be offered to residential net-metering systems, while 30% of it will be given to small commercial PV systems. The remaining 30% will be allocated to agricultural PV projects.
The April issue of pv magazine, due out in a week’s time, takes a look at how the long-established link between solar and cannabis cultivation can help improve margins as medicinal and recreational use of the drug comes out of the weeds. We take a trip Down Under to examine why communities are rebelling against planned renewable energy zones perceived as being railroaded through without sufficient local consultation, and we consider the “solar crime” wave sweeping the UK and Europe.
Another reason for the scheme’s lavish support for batteries is the government’s aim to maximize the self-consumption element of net-metered systems. Solar-plus-battery systems will only be able to inject power to the grid when both the site consumption and the charging of the battery are met. Similarly, the government says if a solar system does not generate enough power to cover a site’s needs, the user will only be able to buy power from the grid when the battery is empty. All solar-plus-storage systems supported by the new subsidy scheme will be obliged to operate under this business model for the first five years.

The “Stabil” research project aims to investigate the potential load scenarios to which grid-forming inverters could be exposed in the future.
“Based on these investigations, conclusions will be drawn about the optimal and cost-efficient dimensioning, especially with regard to the power semiconductors,” said Fraunhofer ISE.
The consortium will measure the performance of the first grid-forming inverter prototypes at a PV plant in Dürbheim, Germany. The aim of these first tests is to examine the performance of the devices under real operating conditions, stress factors, and typical stress profiles.
After these tests are finalized, experts from the three entities will be able to develop so-called “mission profiles,” which define values such as global horizontal, direct, and diffuse irradiances and ambient temperature.
“These will be analyzed in the laboratory in combination with the identified future loads,” they said. “From this feedback, recommendations of an optimized design for durable devices and their components with long lifetimes are to be derived and presented to the public.”
Kaco New Energy will participate in the project by integrating the grid-forming control for PV into its devices. Infineon Technologies will provide optimized semiconductor modules for the inverters.
“In the energy system of the future, which will be largely built without the grid-forming synchronous machines in today’s must-run conventional power plants, grid-forming inverters must provide grid stability not only during normal operation, but also during severe grid faults,” said Fraunhofer ISE.

Over the past decade, SHS have dominated rural electrification, as they have progressively entered rural homes across the continent by providing them with the most basic needs of lighting, small appliance charging, and TV.
However, the challenge with SHS is that they are often too small to power larger appliances, especially those that can help users to generate revenue. And this is specifically where minigrids have a role to play. It is estimated that minigrids could eventually provide power to 380 million Africans, according to the World Bank, the most supportive institution with regard to minigrids.
But minigrids face a major problem: Without significant subsidies, they are rarely financially viable. Indeed, building a mini-grid is costly, because it involves the solar and storage equipment, as well as the distribution network. This high cost is then confronted with low average consumption of the villagers, because they simply need very little power (only for a few light bulbs for example) or because their purchasing power does not allow them to buy much electricity.
With a cost per connection of around $500 in the best case, and an average revenue per user (ARPU) of $2 per month, it would indeed take 20 years for investors to recover their costs. This is why commercial investors have ben shying away from minigrids, but things may be about to change.
PUE appliances
Recent announcements by companies such as Husk Power and Engie Energy Access have shown that some investors have made profits with some of their minigrids in Nigeria and Uganda. The secret ingredient to making this possible is based on increasing electricity consumption by supporting the development of commercial and small industrial activity.
This is mainly happening by making “productive use of energy” (PUE) appliances available. Small businesses and artisans have had a chance to acquire equipment (most often through credit) based on electricity instead of diesel. This has created a virtuous circle of lower operating costs, more profit, more purchasing power, and more economic activity, which ultimately benefits minigrid companies.
As such, PUE appliances and solutions such as e-mobility can really be seen as the true enabler of minigrids across Africa. There already are dozens of different types of PUE appliances available on the market, fully off-grid or grid-connected. In some cases, they allow end-users to multiply their profits and unlock economic development in rural areas.
These solutions have the potential to be game-changers for Africa and shall for sure attract a lot of attention of investors and development partners in the coming years. In an attempt to shed more light on the realm of possibilities of PUE, AFSIA will be releasing its first PUE catalog at the end of April to show the extent and impact of those various solutions already available in the market.
More to come
There are already many minigrids in operation, and many more to come. But many more have been under development, and others have been recently announced. No doubt that with this new development about profitability, we could soon see an explosion of such projects finally being financed and built.
Here is a non-exhaustive list of project announcements and developments over just the past few weeks:
Husk Power ambitions to expand the six minigrids it has installed in Nigeria’s Nasarawa state to more than 100 such networks in 2023 and 500 by 2026.
The minigrid space continues to attract a lot of attention from development partners. But with the recent demonstration that minigrids can actually generate profits, there is no doubt that commercial finance players will jump on the bandwagon, with eagerness to make an impact in Africa and make a profit.

“Large area perovskite solar modules have issues with their stability due to intrinsic point defects and a mass of surface imperfections introduced during the fabrication process,” researcher Prem Jyoti Singh Rana told pv magazine.
The researchers used a hydrophobic, all-organic salt known as fluorinated anilinium benzylphosphonate (FABP) to modify the top surface of large area slot-die coated methylammonium (MA)-free halide perovskite layers. The salt acts as a molecular lock that is able to bind to both anion and cation vacancies, which significantly increases the materials' intrinsic stability.
“It not only reduces the ingression of external species such as oxygen and moisture, but also suppresses the egress of volatile organic components during the thermal stability testing,” the academics said, noting that the absence of MA is a decisive factor, due to its tendency to undergo chemistry leading to volatile and electrochemically reactive products.
The research group built two different modules with an active area of 58.5 cm2 and 64 cm2, respectively. The first achieved a power conversion efficiency of 19.28% and the second of 17.62%.
“Unencapsulated FABP-based devices show excellent thermal stability, retaining 80% and 70% of its initial power conversion efficiencies after 2,700 hours and 1,700 hours at 65 C and 85 C, respectively,” the researchers explained. “Unencapsulated FABP-based mini-modules show around 80% efficiency retention after 7,500 hours (313 days) under 30% relative humidity (RH). They also remarkably retain more than 90% of the initial efficiency for over 850 hours while being measured continuously under light illumination.”
The scientists presented the module in “Molecular Locking with All-Organic Surface Modifiers Enables Stable and Efficient Slot-Die Coated Methyl-Ammonium-Free Perovskite Solar Modules,” which was recently published in Advanced Materials.
“Impressively the FABP-treated PSMs retained more than 90% of the initial efficiency after more than 850 hours of exposure at continuous 1 sun illumination, attesting to the effectiveness of this new generation of non-halide based passivator in boosting the stability of perovskites via the strong binding and secondary interaction between both organic molecules and perovskite surfaces,” they concluded.

At the same time, growing energy demands are driving cities to seek more sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy solutions. With the declining costs of solar photovoltaics and advances in technology, more cities are turning to rooftop solar in their urban energy planning.
Supporting cities in their energy planning process, IRENA has developed a user-friendly web application called the SolarCity Simulator. The online tool allows municipal authorities to assess their solar energy potential, while addressing the issues of affordability and environmental externalities.
As part of the Global Atlas for Renewable Energy Initiative – the largest ever such open source initiative incorporating renewable energy resource maps, datasets, and supplementary information – the SolarCity Simulator was developed in close collaboration with countries authorities. It examines a city’s 3D building footprint obtained from satellite imagery and the solar resource profile.
The user-friendly simulator allows households, businesses, and municipalities in selected cities to evaluate the costs and benefits of installing rooftop solar PV in their chosen location. By simply selecting the city on the map, the scale, the particular roof and configuration of the PV system to install, users can immediately see:
(i) The technical potential for each selected roof, including mapping of the suitable areas to install PV systems at 1m2 spatial resolution with its corresponding electricity production at different scales (hourly, daily, and annual).
(ii) The financial potential of different case studies (homeowner, investor, and government) considering a range of economic indicators, such as payback, Equity Internal Rate of Return, and investment cash flow, considering the local context of the cities.
(iii) The Socio-environmental benefits through information on the annual carbon emission avoided, the equivalent number of tropical trees planted, the equivalent number of cars taken off the street when sourcing the electricity from rooftop solar PV systems, and the potential of jobs created.
The methodology of the SolarCity Simulator can be deployed cost-effectively worldwide, including in locations where solar potential is high, but not yet fully evaluated. First developed in 2019 as a pilot project to assess the potential of rooftop solar PV deployment in the city of Kasese (Uganda), the upgraded 2021 version of the Simulator includes the mapping of rooftop solar PV potential in high resolution in a total of 19 cities. The latest additions to the SolarCity Simulator are Basseterre and Charlestown in Saint Kitts and Nevis.
As the first city to receive the support of SolarCity Simulator, Kasese has seen the benefits of its application. Using the Simulator, the city of Kasese analysed the potential usage and investment needs of installing rooftop PV on different structures in various parts of the city.
New policies followed including efforts to attract investments, programmes to train households and small businesses to deploy home-based solar systems, and awareness-raising activities to ensure buy-in from residents. As a result, the residents of Kasese embraced the deployment of solar in their city, including their homes. The shift from polluting kerosene lamps to clean solar power brought improved health to many.
“Health centers in Kasese are seeing fewer cases of chest congestion-related diseases,” says Mayor Godfrey Kabbyyanga.
The change also offered new economic opportunities as people saved money on electricity, not having to continuously buy paraffin for lamps. “We were able to save money so I can start my small business,” says Bridget Kabugho, a resident of Kasese. “With the new income, I can also afford to buy new clothes and food for my children.”
More cities are discovering the advantages of the Simulator.
”The SolarCity Simulator has given us an opportunity to be able to assess the techno-commercial viability of markets. What is also very useful is that it covers a large portion of the city's rooftops for potential solar projects. We have commenced the use of the Simulator in the three cities available – Sokoto, Jimeta and Kaduna – for potential investments and hope to build on the success of this to scale up to other cities.” says Suleiman Babamanu, technical project lead for the Rural Electrification Agency, Nigeria.
To ensure more communities enjoy the wider socio-economic benefits of rooftop solar PV deployment, IRENA plans to add more cities to the platform in collaboration with governments, particularly in Africa, Middle East, and Small Island Developing States.

The French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) has confirmed that Solestial's solar cells are able to repair radiation-related damage. Its tests have confirmed that the silicon cells effectively anneal radiation damage under sunlight at 194 F (90 C). Annealing is the process of slowly cooling to remove internal stresses of a material. 
The open-circuit voltage of Solestial’s silicon solar cells dropped by only 4% and maintained 96% of their initial value after being exposed to radiation equivalent to 10 years in low Earth orbit and annealing at 194 F under one Sun illumination equivalent. The company said its 20-micron thick cells demonstrate more than 20% efficiency.
The company said the tests demonstrate the feasibility of self-curing solar cells with substantially reduced radiation-induced degradation. This is particularly important for space-based solar cells, which are buffeted by high levels of radiation and are required to operate for long lifecycles. 
“Annealing of radiation damage in silicon is straightforward at high temperatures, for example, above 200 C to 250 C, but this is not useful for applications in space as these temperatures are rarely, if ever, experienced in situ,” said Romain Cariou, a space silicon solar applications expert for CEA. “The differentiation factor here is that Solestial’s cells can cure radiation damage at normal operating temperatures for solar panels in space.” 
Cariou said this response to irradiation cannot be found in current commercial cell technologies. Over the course of a 10-year mission, commonly used III-V multijunction solar panels will lose 10% to 15% of the beginning of their life efficiency due to radiation damage alone. For conventional terrestrial silicon solar panels, the damage will be even greater at 35% to 40%. Neither III-V nor terrestrial silicon have shown independent laboratory validation of such significant low-temperature annealing, said Solestial. 
“We look forward to further testing with the CEA over the coming months to validate internal annealing results at even lower temperatures,” said Stanislau Herasimenka, chief executive officer of Solestial. “We’re excited to show the space industry the myriad benefits of Solestial’s ultrathin silicon solar cells and blankets.”
The company said another advantage of its technology is that it is silicon-based, while many other solar panels made from space are often made from rarer or more expensive materials like gallium arsenide. The Arizona-based company has been developing its technology for over a decade, beginning its life in Arizona State University. It underwent a $10 million seed funding round in October 2022.
