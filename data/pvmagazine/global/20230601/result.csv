“Thus far, glass defects have been regarded as a failure beyond repair and no noticeable attempt has been made to develop reparation methods,” they stressed, noting that their technique is based on methodologies applied in the automotive industry, in which glass laminates reparation has a long track record. “Ultimately, this research aims to add to the scarce scientific knowledge on PV modules repair options, in particular glass-glass PV modules, and aspires to place defect PV modules in a new perspective: from waste to valuable products.”
The researchers explained that glass breakage in glass-glass solar panels may lead to the disruption of the insulation of the encapsulant layer, which would cause the penetration of water and humidity in the modules, or the creation of microcracks in the solar cells, which would be highly detrimental to their performance.
The proposed technique is based on a method for edge pit reparation of windshields from Germany-based Novus Automotive GmbH and advice provided by international glass expert Marcel Falk.
It is implemented in seven different steps: Determining freshness and the end of the fracture; cooling or heating the PV module to the required temperature of 5 C to 29 C; cleaning the module with window cleaner; inserting the repair resin into the fractures using small drops; applying drops of pit resin on top of the larger edge pits; placing an ultraviolet (UV) lamp at a distance of 20–30 cm and curing for a minimum of 20 minutes; and checking if all fractures are repaired.
“The materials required for the experimental reparation consists of repair resin and pit resin designated for windshields that aim to restore the strength and insulation of the glass layers,” the academics explained. “Furthermore, a UV lamp with an intensity of 108 W UVA is required for the strengthening of the resin, the resin can also be cured by natural UV light.”
They conducted accelerated lifetime damp heat simulations, as well as performance and reliability tests, to validate the effectiveness of the repairing process. They compared the performance of 30 glass-damaged panels with that of non-damaged modules, which were all coming from an operational PV installation operated by SolSolutions in the Netherlands. The array utilizes 290 W panels provided by Chinese producer DMEGC.
Through this experiment, the research team ascertained that the proposed methodology doesn't harm the repaired panels, which were found to perform “properly” after the repair and the tests. “The absence of water-instigated degradation indicates that repaired glass layers are insulating again,” it explained. “However, definite conclusions must be made with caution since the non-repaired PV modules did not show visual signs of water ingress either.”
The scientists introduced the new approach in the study “Experimental repair technique for glass defects of glass-glass photovoltaic modules – A techno-economic analysis,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells. “Overall, the first indicators for a technically feasible and effective repair technique are positive,” they concluded.

German thin-film solar module manufacturer Avancis claims to have achieved a new world record efficiency for a completely encapsulated CIGS module with an integrated series connection measuring 30 cm × 30 cm.
The 203% efficiency was certified for a panel with an aperture area of 527 cm2 by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL). The previous record for a CIGS module of this size was 19.64%.
“This success was made possible by further optimizing the Ga-rich Cu (In, Ga) (S, Se)2 absorber bandgap profile by adapting the AVANCIS SEL-RTP process (stacked elemental layer – rapid thermal processing) in combination with the Na-based post-deposition treatment of the absorber and the Cd-free, sputtered Zn (O, S) buffer,” the company said in a statement.
Avancis said the processes used to achieve the record efficiency could be easily transferred to commercial production.
“These large-area thin-film solar modules open up almost limitless design freedom in the planning and realization of future oriented solar facades,” it said. “The special Avancis color technology enables dynamic coloring and thus an interplay of light and color, and the matt, noble surface creates an architectural highlight.”
Avancis has developed a high-efficiency solar panel with a CIGS absorber, sodium-based post-treatment, and cadmium-free sputtered zinc oxysulphide buffer. The panel was made at its research center in Munich, Germany.
Avancis has been part o fChinese state-owned CNBM since 2014. Its head office is located in Torgau, Germany, with additional locations in Munich and Ochang, South Korea.

KfW IPEX-Bank, a subsidiary of Germany's development bank KfW, has provided a €130 million ($138.8 million) financing package for the project, which will include the deployment of 840 km of low voltage lines, 25,000 poles, and 3,600 LED lights for street lighting.
AsantYs System will develop the mini-grids with the support of German company Gauff Engineering. They will power 24,000 domestic connections, including five sockets and live LEDs in each household. The mini-grids will have a power range of 15 kW to 190 kW and will all include battery storage.
“The Senegalese government, through ASER, is having the necessary infrastructure built in the villages and then handing it over to private operators who are already contractually bound to ensure the operation and maintenance of the handed-over infrastructure,” a Gauff spokesperson told pv magazine. “The tariffs are regulated and laid down in the corresponding operator contracts. But there are regulated tariffs from local utility Senelec that can serve as a guideline.”
In December 2020, Asantys Systems secured an initial contract for 120 villages. By early 2021, it had supplied six pilot villages. As of the end of 2022, Senegal had installed around 263 MW of solar power, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.

ICRA projects a rebound in renewable energy capacity addition in India, with expectations of 20 GW in fiscal 2024 compared to 15 GW in fiscal 2023. This includes 16 GW from solar, 2 GW from wind, and an additional 2 GW from hybrid projects.
The extension granted by the Ministry of Power until March 2024 for solar and hybrid projects, relaxation of the ALMM requirement, and recent moderation in solar PV cell and module prices are anticipated to drive capacity addition this fiscal year, according to ICRA.
Vikram V, vice president and sector head – corporate ratings at ICRA, said that the slowdown in bidding activity in the solar power segment in fiscal 2023 due to elevated module prices, ALMM challenges, and duties on imported modules. While there is visibility for renewable energy capacity addition in the near term, significant tendering activity is necessary to meet the renewable purchase obligation (RPO) targets.
Despite execution risks and input cost pressures, ICRA maintains a “stable” outlook for the renewable energy sector, driven by strong policy support, favorable demand prospects, and competitive tariffs. The sector also benefits from the realization of overdue payments and regular bill payments by discoms under the Late Payment Surcharge scheme.
According to JMK Research, India is expected to install 16.8 GW of new solar capacity in 2023, comprising approximately 14 GW of utility-scale projects and 2.8 GW of rooftop projects. In 2022, India installed 11.4 GW of utility-scale solar capacity and 1.9 GW of rooftop PV, resulting in a total of 13.3 GW. As of December 31, 2022, the cumulative utility-scale solar capacity in India was approximately 53.6 GW, with an additional 44.6 GW in the pipeline.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/01/improving-ground-mounted-solar-power-plant-performance-via-orbiting-reflectors/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 1, 2023",Improving ground-mounted solar power plant performance via orbiting reflectors,"A group of scientists from the University of Glasgow has suggested using lightweight orbiting reflectors powered by photovoltaics to increase electricity generation in solar power plants located on Earth.
Through their work, the researchers defined a single reference architecture for orbiting solar reflectors, as well as a detailed analysis of the integrating orbital dynamics, attitude control, and structures. They also assessed the breakeven conditions of these systems in terms of energy prices, launch costs, and discount rates, while noting that the proposed architecture is representative of current or near-term developments in both the energy and space sectors.
They specified that the orbiting reflectors may be particularly beneficial for terrestrial solar power generation at dawn and dusk when there is less sunlight and output is low.
The reflectors are assumed to be built with triangular elements, which the research group said have the advantage that a structure of any arbitrary size can be constructed with them. “Moreover, in the case of membrane tearing, only a single triangular module would be damaged, rather than the entire structure,” it explained. “Developments of the SpaceX Starship reusable launch vehicle will be considered for the transportation of materials and components to space.”
The reflectors would have a hexagonal shape and a diameter of approximately 1 km. They would also be based on multiple mirrors in formations and would utilize control moment gyroscope (CMG) rotors, while operating at an altitude of 884.59 km and being able to perform 14 orbits per 24-hour cycle.
“A hexagonal reflector has been considered for its versatility for in-orbit manufacturing and assembly, where it is assumed that the shape would be assembled from the equilateral triangular elements with 50m side length,” the academics stated. “A combination of the shape requirement and actuator constraints eventually leads to an overall hexagon side of 250m.”
The research team considered different planned or operating giant solar power plants to validate their approach and said that the world's largest solar project under development – the $20 million Sun Cable project in Australia – may be considered an exemplary solar power plant for the proposed technology.
“This paper considers inclined orbits, but the orbit is selected such that it is ‘anchored' to the Sun Cable solar farm,” it also noted. “The reflectors in this orbit can service nine large solar power plants over one sidereal day, delivering a total quantity of 283.8 MWh solar energy.”
Their cost analysis also highlighted that this technology may achieve an average cost of additional electricity of $70/MWh at a 5% discount rate over a 20-year period. “If a more realistic discount rate of 15% is used, then the same target price can be achieved by reducing the reflector mass density to approximately 13.2gm-2,” they concluded. “Even though this value is smaller than that found in this paper, it is expected that future advancements in space technology may lead to a reduction in the mass density, with the additional advantage that smaller actuators can be used for the same reflector size.”
They presented their findings in the paper “A reference architecture for orbiting solar reflectors to enhance terrestrial solar power plant output,” which was recently published in Advances in Space Research.

ACEN Australia, the Australian unit of Philippines-based clean energy company AC Energy, is set to install Australia’s biggest battery at 1.4 GW / 2.8 GWh near Uralla, in northern New South Wales.
The company said the New South Wales government has approved its plans to increase the size of its New England battery from 200 MW/400 MWh to a version seven times as large. The battery will be stationed next to ACEN Australia’s 720 MW (AC) New England Solar Farm. The first 400 MW stage of the solar farm opened in March.
The expanded battery stays within the approved site boundary, using additional land for construction purposes, according to ACEN Australia. The chosen area's proximity to the substation allows for connection to the electricity transmission network. ACEN Australia's modification plans for the solar project's stage two include unspecified changes aimed at optimizing the project and progressing toward construction.

The Global Electronics Council (GEC) has unveiled the “Criteria for the Assessment of Ultra-Low Carbon Modules.” This set of criteria aims to “establish a framework, standardized methodology, and performance objectives to incentivize manufacturers and suppliers to design and manufacture low embodied carbon photovoltaic (PV) modules.”
The GEC developed two levels of emissions standards: low carbon and ultra-low carbon (ULCS). To meet the low carbon standard, a solar module, including its frame, must have an embodied carbon footprint equal to or less than 630 kg CO2e/kWp. To meet the ULCS standard, a module’s footprint must be at or below 400 kg CO2e/kWp.
In their analysis, GEC created charts estimating the carbon intensity of power grids in various countries involved in solar panel production. They then calculated a “Global Warming Potential” (GWP) coefficient for each solar panel subcomponent.

What are the main drivers behind this growth?
Szolnoki: According to the latest figures from the Hungarian transmission system operator, we were already at more than 4.5 GW of cumulative installed PV capacity at the end of first quarter this year.
In the under 50 kW rooftop segment, we had two consecutive record years with around 400 MW installed. In 2021, there was a big surge in installations for fear of ending a very favorable net metering scheme. Last year, our centrally regulated electricity price for households and small enterprises, which was the lowest one in Europe, was doubled because of the energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine and that meant that everybody wanted PV.
In the over 50 kW market segment, where utility-scale PV plants account for the lion’s share, the installation figures are also strong. There are some 5 GW of allocated capacities for utility-scale PV which is to be built in the next four to five years, but these are old capacities, which means that the application was received three or four years ago.
Grid congestion is hampering the rollout of large-scale solar in Hungary. How dire is this threat?
For the last two years, no utility-scale project was able to secure a grid connection. However, around 3 GW of projects that submitted applications last year got their answers from the grid operator mid-May that they won’t be able to connect before 2028. It took 12 months to greenlight these big PV projects.
Last year, the rooftop PV market took a hit from a policy shift. What are we seeing in this segment today?
In October, the Hungarian government introduced a provision for sub-50 kW PV installations, under which new systems could no longer feed into the grid. This led to a total collapse in sales of new systems. Now, we are seeing some activity in this market segment, although a decreasing one.
The latest issue of pv magazine celebrates China’s journey from solar new entrant to the installation of more than 100 GW(AC) of panels this year – Vincent Shaw and Frank Haugwitz consider a remarkable 20-year journey. We take a look at what Indonesia needs to achieve its net-zero ambition and also explore the stirrings of a solar renaissance in Europe, via buzzing trade shows and gigafatory planning.
We are expecting a decision in August about the potential lifting of this feed-in ban, which was originally introduced as a preventive measure as the grid was getting saturated. A new net billing, which we call gross metering, is in the works but the rules have not been defined yet.
Will solar find its way to thrive despite these challenges?
Definitely.  In the sub-50 kW market segment, I can imagine that the installation figures will be a bit lower this year or even on the same level because only days before the introduction of the feed-in ban some 100,000 new applications came in and they are still being delivered. In the utility-scale segment, if one out of these 5 GW of the allocated capacity is built every year, that means that even 2023 is going to be a record year with above 1 GW in total.

However, exorbitant energy prices last year have changed the equation.
“When market prices were soaring, a number of PPAs got signed, with the majority being corporate PPAs (10 out of the 13 announced in 2022),” said Ann Cocquyt, regional lead PPA transaction at Pexapark. “We even saw some projects deliberately stepping out of the CfD scheme to go for a cPPA instead, an example of this the V-Ridium PPA with T-Mobile Polska.”
The uptake in the most recent renewables auctions was disappointing.
“The competition and low bid prices versus increasing capex are the main reason for the undersubscribed auctions,” Cocquyt told pv magazine. “Solar PPA activity definitely picked up as the [contract-for-difference] strike prices failed to keep up with the wholesale market prices. However, market prices have retrieved since then, and there remains limited risk appetite for long term profile risk on the utility side.”
She said there is a solid demand from corporates, but the question will be at what prices and for what tenors, as that will define whether it will be sufficient to replace the contract-for-difference option. Going forward, cost efficiency, price hedging against rising electricity costs, and sustainability efforts are expected to continue to drive the PPA demand. However, headwinds are also having an impact.
“There have been several important regulatory changes that make the circumstances uncertain and less attractive,” Cocquyt said. “There is a revenue cap in place until 30 December 2023, with a level far below €180/MWh which was suggested by the EU.”
The PLN 355/MWh ($83.50/MWh) revenue cap for PV installations with capacity over 1 MW was introduced in November 2022. This required all installations selling electricity under PPAs above the auction reference price, plus PLN 50, to pay a tax on earnings exceeding this amount. The solution faced criticism for significantly impacting solar plant profitability.
“There has been an intervention in the balancing market (regulating prices) and an abolition of the exchange obligation for the day-ahead volumes, turning the day-ahead market potentially less liquid and pricing less transparent,” Cocquyt said. “This might have a negative effect on the long-term appetite from both utility off-takers and investors.”
Additional new regulations are expected in the Polish PPA space in the coming months, including potential permits for the construction of direct lines in connection with the supply of energy under PPAs.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/01/thai-market-ripe-for-entrepreneurial-spirit/,"SPONSORED,ASIA,WORLD",,"JUNE 1, 2023",Thai market ripe for entrepreneurial spirit,"Polytechnology Thailand President, Narratchai Leeraphant, says solar’s strong uptake in the country means the market is ready for next-generation technology, namely, batteries, electric vehicle chargers, solar optimizers, and “full stack” product bundles.
Recent changes to Thai safety standards and regulations for solar system rapid shutdown will make optimizers a growing trend in the country, Leeraphant says, adding, “So we can up our sell, from only inverters to inverters plus optimizers, for which our solution is the most advanced in the market.”
Solar is so established in Thailand that it is already tricky to install more rooftop systems in some areas, Leeraphant says, so technology to store and use the resultant abundance of green energy is increasingly required.
Polytechnology has been partnering with Huawei since 2014, starting as the brand’s inverter distributer in Thailand and today offering the latter’s range of battery energy storage systems and data-center products. Discussing battery systems, Leeraphant says, “Polytechnology and Huawei have dealt with price, customer expectation, and what current battery technology can offer.” He says the next step is to ramp up educating the market about safety standards and the value of advanced battery technology, to bring the energy storage market to maturity.

While Asia’s rooftop market still tends to be dominated by commercial and industrial installations, Leeraphant says demand among households is booming. The primary barrier for the residential segment is the fact most people are not actually at home during the daytime to use the solar power their panels would generate. Leeraphant believes Huawei’s LUNA2000 home battery, which Polytechnology introduced into the Thai market in 2022, will close this gap, enabling households to shift their solar energy to consume it during the evening.
There is also growing demand for integrated renewable technology product bundles. This full stack strategy is becoming increasingly popular among both solar manufacturers and retailers worldwide and is particularly valuable in Southeast Asia, where electricity networks remain a challenge. These integrated product suites are easier to install and more user friendly – especially important for a region where renewable technology has burst onto the scene a bit later than in Europe, the US, and Australia.
Full stack bundles are valuable for engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firms, Leeraphant says. “Installing rooftop solar,” he explains, “sometimes the price is very tough because there are lots of players, so adding EV [electric vehicle] charging adds more value, compared to other competitors.”
Added value is often on Leeraphant’s mind – alongside heading up Polytechnology he owns a multinational restaurant franchise business and the Thai International School. While, on the surface, these endeavors would appear to have little in common with the solar industry, Leeraphant sees plenty of crossover. The restaurant business has provided lessons in how to manage the energy sector’s sub tiers of dealers, Leeraphant says, while the school has afforded both a platform to teach a generation of students about renewable technology, and also an opportunity to showcase products to parents who make up a cohort of top managers and business owners.
For Leeraphant, the key to good business is staying open to new technology, even if it disrupts companies. While Polytechnology has long been involved in the energy sector, its roots are in oil and gas. Despite that, the company entered into new green markets back in 2011 and, two years later, installed Thailand’s first public EV charger, long before EVs and charging products were mainstream. “Polytech had been studying the EV business since 2011, far before other companies,” says Leeraphant.
Since 2020, demand for EVs and related charging equipment has surged, Leeraphant says, putting Polytechnology in a strong position to leverage its knowledge in the sector. The Polytechnology entrepreneur sees especially big growth potential for public DC (direct current) chargers, of which Leeraphant’s company has already installed around 450 nationwide. In 2021, the company delivered 120 MW of DC charging capacity and almost quadrupled that volume last year, when it reached 450 MW. The demand for home and office chargers is also spiking in Thailand, Leeraphant says.
With nations across the globe committing to carbon neutrality, and Asia expected to experience a big upswing in electricity demand, Leeraphant is confident that demand for solar, EVs, and battery products – today’s main suite of decarbonization technologies – will continue to boom. “We see our growth will still sharply increase in these next years,” he says, “if we come with the right partners.”
“The key factor for success is you must be open to new technology or new alliances all the time,” Leeraphant adds. “Maybe it is not the right time yet but when the time comes, you have to be ready and be the first who sets the market direction, otherwise you can be only a market follower.”

The transaction is part of the company's expansion plans, which include the construction of a 10 GW solar cell factory in China and a 3 GW module manufacturing facility in Italy. It currently operates 1 GW of solar module capacity at two sites in China. Its Italian staff focus on R&D in areas such as interdigitated back-contact (IBC) cells, cylindrical ribbons, glass-glass solutions, and modules with independent sections.

What sets Sunfolding’s terrain-following tracker apart from other designs is pneumatics, a 360-year old technology that converts power into movement.
Traditional trackers are mechanically more complex, which can make installation and maintenance costly. Sunfolding developers discovered that pneumatics offered a simpler approach with advantages in certain solar designs. Some of those advantages include a reservoir (or bladder) for air storage so they can continue operating through loss of power.
They can also operate through loss of air and can run continuously without the threat of overheating. Read more about solar and pneumatics in Sunfolding’s white paper. Without batteries or metal drive components, the pneumatic technology is also able to withstand extremely low temperatures where traditional trackers have had issues.
As noted by Chip McDaniel in Industrial Equipment News, pneumatics offer the advantage of simplicity, low cost and reliability, providing “a quick path to motion,” providing significant force in a small space.
The patented AirDrive technology used by Sunfolding was invented by Leila Madrone, company founder and chief technology officer. Madrone is a roboticist, having received both her bachelors and masters in electrical engineering and computer science from MIT, with a focus on robotics and mechatronics. Early in her career she worked on automation for the genomics industry and the commercialization of NASA robotics hardware. Founded in 2012, Sunfolding was spun out of MIT’s Otherlab. In 2016, the company won a $4.2 million ARPA award for its “pneumatically-actuated PV tracking system.”
The AirDrive system
At the heart of its tracking system is the AirDrive. Based on Madrone’s invention, it consists of flexible bladders (shown above) enclosed in a metal housing with a bladder to the east and one to the west. When the bladders are pressurized to different levels, one side expands and tilts the solar structure in the opposite direction. AirDrive X actuators in the Sunfolding system reportedly weigh less than 50 pounds. Wes Fuller, vice president of sales and strategic partnerships, told pv magazine USA that two people can lift them and attach them to posts anchored in the ground. The automotive-grade pneumatic harnesses connect with the supply air system—one for each 5 MW. These systems come pre-assembled and can be dropped into place on site.
The pneumatic system has fewer critical points of failure than traditional mechanical systems, dramatically reducing maintenance costs, according to Sunfolding. The AirDrive X actuator uses advanced polymers supplied by DuPont, helping them weather exposure to wind, heat, rain and snow.
Sunfolding’s first product was the T29 tracker, which reportedly changed the tracker landscape with its use of pneumatics, is installed in 39 projects in 12 states including sites in California, Colorado, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Texas.
The TopoTrack, introduced in September 2022, is designed for varied terrain. Like the T29, it uses the AirDrive technology, but has mechanically independent, scaled down tracker rows.

The company reports that TopoTrack’s rows are 10 times shorter than traditional trackers, and that they can provide 20 degrees of variation between trackers, thus improving slope tolerance between the rows and allowing for articulation in terrain, including complete directional change in terrain if needed.
The design uses two posts, two actuators and two purlins. As a result of the tracker’s flexibility and simplicity, Sunfolding says that the tracker’s footprint across a project site can be increased when tracker-to-tracker spacing is reduced. Fuller noted that TopoTrack can reduce the need for grading by an estimated 97%, thus resulting in further cost savings.
Headquartered in Alameda, Calif., Sunfolding’s posts, actuators and purlins are made in the U.S. The company partners with auto industry component suppliers to manufacture the AirDrive, and reports that 90% of its bill of materials are sourced from a 250-mile radius of its manufacturing facility in the Midwest, enabling short lead times and reducing procurement risks.
TopoTrack was recently deployed on a site with strict environmental protections in place.  This site featured complex terrain in a high snow load location. TopoTrack technology reportedly enabled the customer to perform zero grading on this site, greatly minimizing the cost of handling complex terrain and permitting risk.
