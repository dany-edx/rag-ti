Fraunhofer IWU has launched an online tool for the sizing of rooftop PV arrays.
The Automated Renewable hOmepower Network (ARON) online platform evaluates the ideal size of PV systems. It considers location, roof pitch, power consumption profiles, and solar module specifications. It can also be used for heat pumps and battery storage.
The researchers offer the tool for free to private households, simulating the local energy yield of photovoltaic systems considering initial investment and energy tariffs. Calculations utilize EU-provided “typical meteorological year” values.
The Hydrogen Lab Görlitz at Fraunhofer IWU is developing a CO2-neutral operation concept for TÜV SÜD's Leipzig-Stahmeln location using the ARON tool. TÜV SÜD aims to achieve climate neutrality in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. The researchers determined electricity and heat requirements, optimizing designs for photovoltaic systems, a small wind turbine, a heat pump, and an optional battery storage system to achieve a balance between CO2 neutrality and cost-effectiveness.

Renewables accounted for a record share of 59.7% of public net electricity generation in Germany in 2023, according to new figures from Fraunhofer ISE.
The research institute recorded new highs for wind power and solar. Onshore and offshore wind were the most important source of public electricity generation at 139.8 TWh, or 32% of the total. Wind farm generation was 14.1% higher than in 2022.
Germany achieved a record-breaking newly installed PV capacity of approximately 14 GW last year, marking the first time the expansion rate hit double digits, surpassing the federal government's target of 9 GW. The 59.9 TWh generated from PV systems contributed 53.3 TWh to the public grid, with 6.4 TWh used for self-consumption.
In June alone, PV systems in Germany generated around 9 TWh of electricity – a new monthly record.
Hydropower also increased,  but with hardly any change in output. It contributed 20.5 TWH to public electricity generation, or 3 TWh more than in 2022. Biomass remained steady at 42.3 TWh.
In total, renewables generated around 260 TWh, up 7% compared from 2022.
Installed battery capacity almost doubled from 4.4 GW in 2022 to 7.6 GW last year. Storage capacity increased from 6.5 GWh to 11.2 GWh. Output of German pumped storage plants reached 6 GW.

The method utilizes particle swarm optimization (PSO) and gravitational search algorithms (GSA) with Nash Bargaining.
“Inspired by social behavior, PSO excels in local search and refinement of solutions, while GSA, inspired by the law of gravity, emphasizes global exploration,” the researchers explained. “The combination of these algorithms aims to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, enabling efficient and robust energy trading strategies.”
The group calibrated some parameters of this hybrid model, following preliminary trials. Then, they added the Generalized Nash Bargaining (GNB) technique, which helps balance the interests of the different microgrids and facilitates fair energy trading outcomes.
After its development, the novel algorithm was implemented into the MATLAB software, where it was asked to solve a trading problem of energy cost minimization. This simulation was conducted with four interconnected microgrids with distinct generation sources: one with only PV, one with only wind power, one with both renewable energy sources, and one with none. All these system configurations were tested under varying energy prices and intricate load profiles.

In addition, the optimization solution for the microgrid trading was compared to a base scenario. Each of those four microgrids could only trade with the utility grid in the base scenario.
According to the results, the overall monthly cost for all four microgrids was $94,551 without energy trading. However, utilizing the PSO-GSA model with Nash Bargaining in a scenario where the microgrids can trade with each other has reduced their total bill to $60,720.
“It can be argued that the energy cost has sufficiently been reduced due to the implementation of the introduced cooperative energy trading within the microgrids,” the scientists said. “For example, in the base case, microgrid 1 has to pay the utility grid bill amount of $749.10 (for 24 hours) for the purchased energy from the main utility grid; however, after the cooperative trading, the same bill amount has been reduced to $500.25.”
In addition, the academic group has compared the novel optimization with four other metaheuristic algorithms under the same data and conditions. While the novel PSO-GSA has an energy cost of $60,720, GWO (Grey Wolf Optimizer) achieved $66,582. MPA (Marine Predator Algorithm) got $64,166; PSO alone got $60,925; ETSO (Enhanced Transient Search Optimization) achieved $61,122; and GSA alone yielded $60,994.
“The proposed hybrid PSO-GSA algorithm outperforms other optimization approaches in terms of its convergence characteristics and its capability to minimize energy costs,” the academics concluded.
The results of the simulations were presented in “Optimal energy trading in cooperative microgrids considering hybrid renewable energy systems,” published in the Alexandria Engineering Journal. The research team included scientists from China's Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Pakistan's COMSATS University Islamabad, Saudi Arabia's Taibah University, and Egypt's Ain Shams University and Future University.

In the study “Design of emergency solar energy system adjacent the nuclear power plant to prevent nuclear accidents and increase safety,” published in Nuclear Analysis, the academics presented a design procedure based on the use of the PVSYST and RetScreen software.
“The main goal of this research is to use solar systems for providing emergency power to nuclear plants in case the power grid is down and other emergency systems such as diesel generators and batteries are not working,” they explained.
The researchers noted that the emergency load at the TRR facility is currently being provided by a 450 kW diesel generator located on the north side of the reactor building, and by a 50 kW diesel generator as a second backup source that could be used if the 450 kW system is damaged or under repair.
The research team proposed to install a 100 kW grid-connected PV system on a 627 m2 area. The system is planned to rely on 305 W polycrystalline modules and 5 inverters with an output of 20 kW each. Its expected that final output annual capacity will be 166.2 MWh. The scientists also assumed the PV array would be linked to a 400 kWh battery system that can provide an emergency load of 50 kW during 8 hours.
The solar plant is intended to back up the 50 kW generator to supply electricity to the nuclear plant's water pumps in case of emergency. “As the first priority, the plant charges the battery pack and discharges excess energy to the power grid,” the group explained. “The system is capable of both charging battery bank and transferring excess energy to the grid, simultaneously.”
According to the scientists, this project typology is technically and economically feasible if the solar plant is entitled to sell power to the grid under a feed-in tariff (FiT) scheme or a net metering regime, which would ensure significant profitability when the array is not used for emergency load.
Assuming the FiTs awarded by Iranian authorities, the scientists found the system's payback time is around 4.5 years.
“By evaluation of all schemes and economic data, it is concluded that construction of this plant leads to improving safety measures of nuclear reactors backed by solar power plants which is capable of generating energy for emergency loads for nuclear reactors,” they concluded. “This plant is a secure backup for nuclear reactors which prevents disasters like Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.”

The country added about 300 MW of new PV installations in 2023. By comparison, it installed 152.7 MW in 2022 and 42.7 in 2021.
The largest share of the cumulative capacity is represented by residential PV systems below 20 kW in size, which total around 190 MW, followed by solar systems with capacities ranging from 5oo kW to 1 MW, which account for around 100 MW.
“This robust growth is not merely a numerical feat but a crucial stride towards achieving Norway's ambitious 2030 target of 8 TWh,” Hassan Gholami, a consultant for Norway's Multiconsult, told pv magazine. “Foreseeing a continuation of this remarkable trajectory, the market is poised for substantial expansion. I believe that Norway will surpass the 1 GW mark in 2024, with projections reaching an impressive total installed solar PV capacity of 2 GW by the end of 2025.”
Gholami said that the annual growth rate needed to achieve the nation's 2030 solar generation target of 8 TWh, starting from 0.454 TWh in 2023, stands at 154%.
“With a current solar PV capacity of 600 MW and a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 154%, the projected solar power production for 2025 is estimated to reach approximately 2.4 GW,” he said. “The exponential growth underscores a promising trajectory, suggesting that Norway is poised to meet the envisioned solar capacity milestones.”
He predicts that the country may post its highest growth rates this year, due to new provisions expected from the government.
“Norway is set to revolutionize its renewable energy landscape by mandating solar power in new government buildings from 2024,” he said. “The agreement aims to simplify permitting for commercial solar installations and foster local solar-generated electricity sharing. With a 2030 target of 8 TWh of solar energy annually, equivalent to about 5% of Norway's average yearly output, this initiative responds to potential power deficits anticipated from 2027 onward. Norway's current solar production at 0.454 TWh.”
Gholami said that the main market drivers for the solar market in Norway involved several key factors. First, the surge in electricity prices, particularly evident since the latter half of 2021, has played a pivotal role. The higher costs have become a major driver, prompting investments in solar installations as individuals and businesses seek to mitigate rising energy expenses.
Second, regulatory changes and financial support schemes have significantly contributed to market growth. Evolving regulations, driven by a push to enhance local energy generation, coupled with a keen interest among individuals in energy pursuits, have fostered favorable conditions for the emergence of solar energy communities. In addition, financial support schemes at the municipal level and robust investment incentives for solar projects have further driven the expansion of solar energy initiatives.
Finally, the continuous decrease in the cost of PV systems in the market – despite higher waiting times for installations – is a noteworthy driver, said Gholami. This enhances the economic viability of solar projects, making them increasingly attractive to a broader range of consumers and businesses, ultimately propelling the growth of the PV market in Norway.
Gholami said that last year's growth was also linked to the operation of several utility-scale PV projects.
“These initial forays have yielded promising results,” he explained. “So far, 44 sites have applied for the requisite permissions to obtain licenses for utility-scale solar PV projects across the country, each at varying stages of the approval process, with decisions finalized for some. A comprehensive overview of these projects is available at NVE.no, showcasing robust activity in this sector.”
He said that several companies are active in the burgeoning Norwegian PV market.
“A compelling forecast indicates that several of these entities are poised to realize their first utility-scale solar PV sites by the conclusion of 2025, ushering in a new era of solar energy deployment in Norway,” he said.

The scientists acknowledged that replacing lead (Pb) with tin (Sn) in perovskite solar cells implies a considerable reduction in power conversion efficiency and explained that this depends on the presence of tin(IV)-sulfide (Sn4+), which is formed by the oxidation of Sn during the perovskite ink preparation, keeping perovskite inks, or baking the perovskite film.
In order to reduce the presence of Sn4+ concentrated on the surface of the perovskite film, the research group adopted a new passivation strategy based on the use of phenylsilane (PhSiH3) as a reducing agent.
“As far as we know, there is no report on the surface passivation with organic solutions consisting of reducing agents,” it explained, noting that using PhSiH3 results in the formation of a siloxane layer, which creates better contact between the hydrophilic tin perovskite absorber and hydrophobic buckminsterfullerene (C60) used for the electron transport layer (ETL). “After the surface passivation, the contact angle became larger, demonstrating that the perovskite surface became more hydrophobic.”
The academics built the cell with a substrate made of glass and a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), a hole transport layer (HTL) made with PEDOT:PSS, a polymer known for its low cost and easy preparation properties, an absorber made of a lead-free perovskite material known as ASnI2Br, an ETL based on C60, a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
The scientists compared the performance of the solar cell with that of a reference device that did not go through the novel passivation treatment. They found the latter achieved an efficiency of 3.65%, while the treated device reached 5.50%, which they said proves the effectiveness of the PhSiH3 treatment.
The results are explained by faster photoluminescence decay after the surface treatment, lower series resistance and higher charge recombination resistance after the surface treatment, they noted. “It was proved that PhSiH3 is effective for decreasing Sn4+ accumulated on the perovskite films and for achieving better contact of the perovskite layer with C60 layer,” they concluded.
The solar cell design and the passivation techniques are described in the paper “Efficiency-enhancement of lead-free ASnI2Br perovskite solar cells by phenyltrihydrosilane passivation effective for Sn4+ reduction and hydrophobization,” published in Next Materials.

In December alone, Bangladesh’s Cabinet Committee on Government Purchase (CCGP) approved tariffs for seven solar power plants totaling 630 MW. Approvals were granted for 200 MW in November, 310 MW in October, 570 MW in September, 300 MW in August, 66 MW in April, and 120 MW in January 2023. Most of these projects secured a fixed tariff of around $0.10/kWh.
The largest solar plant given approval last year was a 300 MW array, to be set up by a consortium of Saudi-based ACWA Power and locally owned Comfit Composite Knit, Viyellatex Spinning, and Midland East Power.
The second-largest solar power plant secured approval in December. The 240 MW facility will be set up in Mymensingh in northern Bangladesh by a joint venture between Energon Renewables (BD) and PWR Energy Trading LLC.
In September, the government approved a 200 MW floating and ground-mounted solar power plant near the Barapukuria coal mine in Dinajpur district. A consortium of China's Hangzhou Boiler and Max Infrastructure secured approval in October to jointly set up a 180 MW facility in Jamalpur district.
This increase in projects is likely due to new measures that were recently introduced to help domestic independent power producers build and operate new renewable energy plants.
Dipal C Barua, chief adviser of the Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association, expressed high hopes that green power will have a significant share in country’s total energy mix.
“The government is providing utmost importance to renewable energy in changed global economic scenario,” Barua told pv magazine.
Barua said that the recently approved solar power plants are well-prepared, and sponsor companies must submit applications for government approval, ensuring successful commissioning.

“The panels are connected to a single string inverter and will supply the local industry through subsea cable,” the company's CEO, Børge Bjørneklett, told pv magazine, noting that it is not a grid-connected solution.
The plant is based on Ocean Sun's novel system design featuring a thin floating membrane that is just 1 mm thick. It also features customized monocrystalline modules provided by China-based GCL System Integration (GCL SI).
The installation at Tazacorte is part of the three-year project “Bringing Ocean Sun Systems to Market”, codenamed Boost, that is aimed to demonstrate and validate a solution for seawater floating PV. It was funded in part by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program and coordinated by Ocean Sun.
As part of the project, the site-specific design verification was obtained early on from Norway’s DNV and done according to Ocean Sun's design premise.
The BOOST consortium includes the Technological Institute of the Canary Islands (ITC) and the Oceanic Platform of the Canary Islands (PLOCAN), both based in Spain, plus Norway-based Fred Olsen Renewables and Innosea, based in France.
Ongoing testing of water ingress protection, mechanical integrity of cells and PV performance are activities undertaken by Ocean Sun and GCL SI before and in parallel to the Spanish project, according to Bjørneklett. For example, the modules’ frameless design, meant to reduce aluminum usage, passed immersion tests by TUV Rheinland in heated seawater under 1500 V tension.

In the week of Dec. 25, changes in solar energy production compared to the previous week showed no clear trend in the main European electricity markets. In the German and French markets, solar energy production increased by 43% and 2.9%, respectively. The opposite trend occurred in the Southern European markets as solar energy production fell 33% in Italy and 26% in the Iberian Peninsula.
For the week of Jan. 1, according to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s production forecasts, solar energy will decrease in Germany, Italy and Spain.


There was a weekly decline in all major European electricity markets for wind energy production in the last week of 2023. The drop ranged from 63% in Italy to 1.6% in France. Despite less overall production, the French market generated 391 GWh of wind energy on Dec. 31 – the highest daily value according to historical data.
For the week of January 1, AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s production forecasts indicate that wind generation will increase in Spain, Portugal and Italy, and decrease in France and Germany.

Electricity demand
In the week of Dec. 25, electricity demand decreased in all major European electricity markets compared to the previous week, which was expected due to the Christmas holidays. The Italian market registered the largest decline of 23% while the Portuguese market registered the smallest drop of 7%.
During that week, the average temperature increased in most analyzed countries ranging from 1.8 C in Germany to 0.3 C in the Netherlands. Only the Iberian Peninsula and Great Britain registered cooler conditions with a temperature decrease between 0.9 C and 2.1 C, respectively.
Electricity demand will increase in all analyzed markets for the week of Jan. 1, according to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s forecasts.

European electricity markets
In the week of Dec. 25, prices in some of the main European electricity markets fell, while in other markets prices increased compared to the previous week. In the EPEX SPOT market of the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Germany, prices fell by 32%, 44%, 47% and 50%, respectively. In the rest of the markets analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, prices rose between 6.9% in the IPEX market of Italy and 16% in the MIBEL market of Portugal.
In the fourth week of December, weekly averages were below €55/MWh in most analyzed European electricity markets. The exceptions were the Spanish, Portuguese and Italian markets, with averages of €76.61/MWh, €76.86/MWh and €116.17/MWh, respectively. In the rest of the analyzed markets, prices ranged from €20.69/MWh in the German market to €54.98/MWh in the N2EX market of the United Kingdom.
The German, Belgian, French and Dutch markets registered negative hourly prices on most days of the last week of December, as well as on Jan. 1. In the early morning hours of Dec. 25, the German, Belgian and Dutch markets reached their lowest prices since Aug. 8, while the French market reached its lowest price since July 16. The lowest hourly price, ‑€13.37/MWh, was in the German market. The British market also registered negative prices on Dec. 25, 28 and 29 and Jan. 1. In the case of the Spanish and Portuguese markets, there was a price of €0/MWh on Sunday, Dec. 31, from 4:00 to 6:00.
During the week of Dec. 25, the general drop in electricity demand and the increase in solar energy production in countries such as Germany and France contributed to the price decreases registered in the EPEX SPOT market. However, wind and solar energy production fell in Italy and the Iberian Peninsula. This led to higher prices in these markets.
AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s price forecasts indicate that in the first week of January, prices might increase in most European electricity markets. The recovery in demand and the decrease in wind energy production in some markets might contribute to this behavior. However, the IPEX and MIBEL markets might register price decreases. A significant rise in wind energy production in these markets would lead to these price decreases.

 
Brent, fuels and CO2
Brent oil futures for Front‑Month in the ICE market started the last week of December up $2/bbl from the price of the last session of the previous week. On Tuesday, Dec. 26, these futures registered their weekly maximum settlement price, $81.07/bbl. But for the rest of the week, prices declined. As a result, on Friday, Dec. 29, they reached their weekly minimum settlement price of $77.04/bbl.
In the last week of December, high production levels in countries such as the United States, Brazil or Guyana and concerns about the evolution of demand continued to exert their downward influence on Brent oil futures prices. The announcement by some companies of their intention to resume shipping through the Red Sea also contributed to the decline in prices in the last sessions of the week.
As for TTF gas futures in the ICE market for the Front‑Month, on Wednesday, Dec. 27, they reached the weekly maximum settlement price, €35.51/MWh. But on Thursday the price fell by 6.8%. After falling another 2.3%, these futures registered their weekly minimum settlement price, €32.35/MWh, on Friday, Dec. 29. According to data analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, this price was the lowest since the first week of September.
In the last week of December, the high levels of European reserves, forecasts of mild temperatures in Northwestern Europe and uncertainty about the evolution of industrial demand led to settlement prices of TTF gas futures remaining below €40/MWh.
As for settlement prices of CO2 emission rights futures in the EEX market for the reference contract of December 2023, during the last week of December, they continued the upward trend of the previous week. As a result, on Friday, Dec. 29, they reached their weekly maximum settlement price, €80.37/t. This price was the highest since the second half of October.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/03/first-solar-closes-700-million-in-tax-credit-transfer-sales/,"FINANCE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 3, 2024",First Solar closes $700 million in tax credit transfer sales,"From pv magazine USA
US thin-film solar module manufacturer First Solar has closed two separate tax credit transfer agreements to sell $500 million and $200 million of IRA advanced manufacturing tax credits.
Under the tax credit transfer, Fiserv agreed to pay $0.96 per $1 of tax credits to First Solar during the first half of 2024, inclusive of fees and commissions paid by First Solar to the placement agent. Fiserv is a global provider of payments and financial services technology solutions. Citigroup Global Markets acted as placement agent for the transfer of Section 45X tax credits.
The tax credits were generated as a result of the sale of solar modules produced in 2023 by First Solar in the United States, including at its new factory in Ohio.
“This is the IRA delivering on its intent, which is to incentivize high value domestic manufacturing by providing manufacturers with the liquidity they need to reinvest in growth and innovation,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer of First Solar. “This agreement establishes an important precedent for the solar industry, confirming the marketability and value of Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credits.”
The deal from First Solar marks one of the first major sales of 45x tax credits. The deal was signed on Dec. 22, 2023 – less than two weeks after guidelines for accessing the credit were released.
“As it relates to the 2023 financial year, we expect a pre- and post-tax impact of up to $28 million, resulting in a reduction of our diluted earnings of up to $0.26 per share for the year,” said Alex Bradley, chief financial officer of First Solar.
First Solar has the option of receiving these funds either as a tax benefit or a direct cash payment from the US Department of the Treasury. The company opted for the Tax Credit Transfer over the Direct Payment option, citing the ability to monetize it 12 to 18 months sooner through a third party. This third party can immediately apply the credit to their own tax liability and provide an instant cash payment to First Solar. In contrast, the Direct Payment would only be processed after First Solar files its tax returns, potentially delaying funds until the second or third quarter of 2024, pending the Internal Revenue Service’s processing and refund issuance.
First Solar’s vertically integrated solar manufacturing facilities are unique in their production of the entire supply chain. This was highlighted in an industry note released by Roth MKM on Dec. 14, 2023, suggesting that First Solar may qualify for the full $0.175/W wafer, cell, and module credit.
Calculations based on the $700 million credit, valued at $0.96 on the dollar, indicate a total manufacturing credit of approximately $729 million. This implies that First Solar manufactured around 4.16 GW of solar panels eligible for the credit in 2023, at a rate of $0.175/W.

With First Solar’s average sales price at $0.32/W, the tax credit amounts to roughly 55% of the cost of their solar panels. This, combined with the potentially higher value of the IRA’s Production Tax Credit compared to some power purchase agreement costs, and the downward trend in solar module pricing due to massive capacity expansions, leads to an intriguing possibility. It’s conceivable that power purchase agreements could be signed at $0.00/kWh before the 45X manufacturer’s credit expires in 2029.
Currently, no other US manufacturers are eligible for the comprehensive suite of solar module manufacturing tax credits. While a number of manufacturers are eligible for the solar module assembly tax credit, eligibility for the cell credit is notably scarce, and this rarity extends to credits for wafers and solar glass as well. Qcells might benefit from the polysilicon tax credit due to the partial operation of the Moses Lake facility by the end of 2023. However, this polysilicon must be exported and processed into wafers and cells prior to being installed in Qcells modules, as their facilities are not fully operational yet.
In addition to boosting US manufacturing, transferability of Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are also gaining momentum in the developer space. Read more about strategies to utilize credits in solar project development here.
“Over the past year, nearly $100 billion in clean energy manufacturing investments have been announced, with plans for close to 100 new facilities across the US,” said José Zayas, executive vice president of policy and programs for the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE).
First Solar expects to invest over $2 billion in new manufacturing facilities in Alabama and Louisiana and expansions in its Ohio plants. The company expects to have 14 GW of vertically integrated US solar manufacturing capacity by 2026. It is also investing up to $370 million in a research and development center in Perrysburg, Ohio, expected to be complete by 2024.
“This remarkable progress is only just beginning. Projections show the Section 45X manufacturing tax credit will help spur billions of dollars in new economic activity over its life,” said Zayas.

SEIA said in its new “Energizing American Battery Storage Manufacturing” report that credits offered through the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have spurred the adoption of electric vehicles, energy storage and other forms of electrification. However, domestic battery manufacturing is still in its nascent stages.
Just over a year ago, in quick response to the IRA incentives, a number of manufacturers revealed plans to set up shop in the United States, and the announcements continue. Freyr unveiled a multi-phase project that is expected to bring battery manufacturing to Georgia. Kore Power recently secured a conditional loan commitment from the US Department of Energy Loans Program Office to build battery cells for electric vehicles and grid-scale storage. LG Energy Solution also recently quadrupled its planned investment in two manufacturing plants in Arizona.
While the announced buildout of domestic manufacturing is promising, many questions remain as to whether manufacturers can overcome the many hurdles on the way to meeting growing storage needs. According to the SEIA report, US manufacturing capacity for all lithium-ion battery applications is currently at 60 GWh, while demand for battery energy storage systems (BESS) in the US market is likely to increase over sixfold from 18 GWh to 119 GWh by 2030.
The SEIA report forecasts that the announced manufacturing facilities could increase domestic capacity to over 630 GWh over the next five years. However, much of this supply may be directed toward meeting demand of EV manufacturers, rather than that of non-vehicle applications such as BESS.
SEIA said more than 25% of the new factories have not publicly stated their intended markets and some (if not all) of their capacity may go to BESS, so there is still hope for steady supply.
Most batteries manufactured in the United States are lithium, and while the country has vast reserves of lithium, other materials are needed such as phosphorous and graphite. These materials are sourced primarily from outside the United States, so domestic manufacturers are competing on a global scale, often finding high prices and short supply.
As with the rest of the renewable energy buildout, securing a strong, skilled workforce is a challenge. According to the SEIA report, roles critical to energy storage supply chains include mining, chemical and electrical engineers, machine operators, production technicians, and more. While apprenticeship incentives are part of the IRA, growing the workforce long term requires committed collaboration among manufacturers, government agencies, training facilities, and other stakeholders.
Building a domestic renewable energy supply chain includes support for energy storage development at all levels, and the report contends that this will require investment, partnerships with experienced manufacturers, and collaboration with allies.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/03/make-pv-modules-as-cheap-as-possible-but-not-cheaper/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",,"JANUARY 3, 2024","Make PV modules as cheap as possible, but not cheaper","The dream of solar cell and PV module manufacturing outside of Asia has become increasingly distant. A combination of falling PV module prices and China’s PV module manufacturers allegedly sitting on up to two months' worth of stock is adding to the maelstrom. Plans for GW-scale PV cell and module production facilities in the US and Europe have been delayed or outright scrapped, and to make it worse, Western markets are accumulating inventories stocked with products purchased for double the current end-of-the-year market prices.
This solar storm is wreaking havoc on the industry, leading to cracked glass in modules and an even more fractured supply chain. In times like these, it could be best to reflect on words uttered by Albert Einstein, who once reportedly said, “Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler”. His argument, that an idea should be made as coherent as possible without being stripped of its meaning, could be applied to solar PV in this current market. Make PV modules as cheap as possible, but not cheaper. Because with anything in life, there is a final price.
How did PV modules become so cheap?
Solar has become the most affordable and fastest-growing energy generation technology. It has surpassed all other renewable and conventional electricity generation technologies year-on-year since 2015. Part of its popularity is rooted in price, with each company being extremely price competitive due to a range of market factors and product improvements. This includes lower kerf losses, better cell packing in modules, less silver, thinner glass, thinner frames, larger modules, cheaper electricity and most importantly, companies flooding the market with products. Consumers buying cheaper decentralized solar rooftop PV systems or utility-scale installation technologies have reaped the rewards. But as time wears on, particularly for large-scale operators, fissures have emerged.
The price of cheap PV modules
Over the span of a decade, PV modules have almost doubled in size with thinner frames, thinner glass and shorter mounting rails. Half-cut cell modules now normally have three holes in the rear glass allowing them to bear a significant weight of the PV load. The shift occurred in 2017 when 2-millimeter-thick hardened (not fully-tempered) glass became cheaper than the PV module gold standard of 3.2-millimeter fully-tempered glass. Around the same time, utility-scale PV power plants began to use mainly bifacial, double-glass.
Nearly all large-scale PV plants today use bifacial, double-glass modules with 2-millimeter-thick glass at the front and rear. But utility-scale solar power plants installed in recent years, which rely on 2-millimeter double-glass PV modules, are reporting up to 10% breakage rates.
The cracks observed are causing warranty claims and contractual disputes costing money, time and integrity. This means that cheap PV is not only leading to worse outcomes for the energy consumer but is also fracturing the industry, impacting PV module and PV tracker suppliers, engineering, product and construction companies, and PV plant owners. This is the case for making PV modules as cheap as possible, but not cheaper.
