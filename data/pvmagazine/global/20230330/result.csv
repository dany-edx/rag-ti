Total exports for January totaled 14.85 GW, with a 32% increase compared to December 2022 and 55% growth on January 2022. In February, module exports reached 14.82 GW, with a slight decrease compared to January and a 6% increase compared to February 2022.
Europe imported 8.6 GW in each month, which represents an increase of 120% and 48% respectively compared to the same periods a year earlier. In 2022, Europe imported a total of 86.6 GW of PV modules from China.
In the Asia-Pacific market, China's PV panel exports reached 2.5 GW and 3.1 GW in January and February respectively, a decrease of 13% and 47% compared to the same months last year.
The year-on-year decrease was mainly due to India, which in 2022 imported about 8.9 GW of PV modules from China, but 8.1 GW of them were imported in the first quarter before the basic customs duty (BCD) tariff on imported equipment tariff was introduced.
After the first quarter of last year, demand for Chinese modules in India rapidly declined, with an average monthly import of only 88 MW. However, demand in India significantly rebounded at the beginning of 2023, with 395 MW imported from China in January and 643 MW in February.
In the Americas, Brazil was the main importing country, accounting for 70% of the overall imports to the region.
The Middle East saw an increase of more than 200% in PV module imports from China in the January-February period, with the UAE and Saudi Arabia accounting for 62% of the region's overall  market. The source of demand is mainly based on several large utility-scale projects, and there is still more solar under construction in the region.
In Africa, South Africa is the main source of demand, accounting for 61% of the total imports to the region. Despite low demand for Chinese PV modules in Africa, South Africa imported a total of 571 MW from China, three times more than in the same period last year.

The European Parliament and the European Council reached a provisional agreement today, which will raise its current target of 32%.
If formally adopted, the deal will almost double the existing share of renewable energy in the EU and will bring the EU closer to delivering on the European Green Deal and RePower EU objectives.
During 15-hour-long negotiations, the bodies also agreed on a further 2.5% indicative target which would bring the EU’s target to the 45% target campaigned for by industry body SolarPower Europe (SPE).
“We believe the negotiators when they say this was the only deal possible,” said Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO of SPE. “As for the indicative 2.5% target, the task now is to use the EU tools at hand to secure the top up. And of course, 45% is a floor, not a ceiling. We'll be working to deliver as much renewable energy by 2030 as possible.”
The EU will purportedly achieve a larger share of renewables by accelerating and simplifying the permitting process.  Renewable energy will be recognized as an overriding public interest, with member states instructed to put in place “go-to-areas” for renewables in areas with high renewables potential and low environmental risks.
The provisional agreement now requires formal adoption by the European Parliament and the Council. Once this process is completed, the new legislation will be published in the Official Journal of the Union and enter into force.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/30/case-study-demonstrates-5-energy-yield-boost-for-n-type-topcon-modules/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,ASIA,CHINA",MARK HUTCHINS,"MARCH 30, 2023",Case study demonstrates 5% energy yield boost for n-type TOPCon modules,"A case study conducted at a 30 MW PV project developed by China Guodian Corporation (CGC) compared the performance of p-type PERC and n-type TOPCon modules under the same installation conditions. The study demonstrated an increased energy yield of just 5% for the n-type modules, over a two-week period in February 2023.
The 30 MW project studied was developed by CGC in Jixian, Tianjin Province. The project features 20 MW made up of two different 545 W, p-type PERC modules from unnamed manufacturers, with the remaining capacity made up of 555 W n-type TOPCon modules supplied by JinkoSolar. All of the modules are installed on fixed tilt racking at a 30 degree angle, and connected in strings of 26 modules with one 225 kW string inverter for every 17 strings.
The performance of the two module types was analyzed during the first two weeks of February 2023. During this period, the n-type modules were shown to have generated an average of 169.53 kWh per kW installed, a 5.02% increase on the 161.43 kWh/kW achieved by the best-performing p-type module at the site.
N-type advantage
Module manufacturer JinkoSolar, which supplied the n-type modules to this project, says this data illustrates the reported advantages of TOPCon over PERC in action. The manufacturer cites the n-type modules’ higher efficiency and better bifaciality as key reasons for the increased performance. Better bifaciality (around 70% for PERC and 80% for TOPCon) could account for a yield increase of 1- 1.5%.
With only two weeks of data, collected during the coldest part of the year in Tianjin Province, other advantages are more difficult to take directly from this case study. However, JinkoSolar also cited its n-type modules’ lower degradation rate – 1% in the first year followed by 0.4% per year as likely to bring a yield increase of around 1.8% over PERC’s typical degradation of 2% in year one followed by 0.45% per year.
Finally, it cited the lower temperature coefficient of n-type modules – 0.29% performance loss per C of temperature increase, versus 0.35% for PERC modules – as responsible for a further 2% yield boost, noting that this advantage would be more visible at the project studied in the summer months when temperatures can reach 30 C and higher.

As part of the Pocityf project, 46 partners have been developing BIPV solutions to blend into the landscape of historical sites in the pilot cities of Évora, Portugal, and Alkmaar, Netherlands. The cities of Granada (Spain), Celje (Slovenia), Bari (Italy), Ioannina (Greece), Upjest (Hungary), and Hvidovre (Denmark) will follow suit.
“The fact that we are focused on historic cities means that we have added challenges, with legal barriers to changing the existing architecture,” Júlia Pereira, project coordinator for EDP New, told pv magazine. “All the solutions are designed so that the aesthetics of the city are not altered, but still manage to rejuvenate the historic centers.”
Évora’s historical center is part of UNESCO’s World Heritage List and is hence covered by special protection and conservation rules. Over 40 BIPV solutions will be implemented in Évora in the next months, all of which have been designed to blend into the existing buildings and structures.
These include classic terracotta PV roof tiles from Italy-based Tegosolar. Dyaqua, an Italian solar start-up, manufactures the so-called “invisible solar” solution by covering monocrystalline silicon cells with a surface that is opaque at the sight but translucent to sun rays. Around 3,350 PV roof tiles will be installed on the rooftop of Evora’s town hall, with a total installed capacity of 25,36 kW. Each roof tile has an output of 7,57 W and an efficiency of 7.80%.
Procurement of the PV roof tiles wasn’t an easy task, according to Pereira. Their production is still happening on a small scale which hinders profitability.
“The price per kW is €7,000 ($7,605),” she said. “The roof tiles took six months to be manufactured and are now ready for installation, which will happen between June and August this year.”

Other solutions include amorphous-silicon photovoltaic glass from Spain-based BIPV specialist Onyx Solar. The colorful see-through solutions were architects’ top choice to replace skylights and windows in municipal buildings, markets, and schools. The skylight of Évora’s municipal market, for example, will feature 74 units with an output of 236 W each. Their efficiency ranges from 2.8% to 5.76%. The installation will cover 124,49 square meters and include glasses of five different dimensions.
 
The project is also implementing BIPV solutions that haven’t yet reached commercialization. “We are developing economic models that can make these solutions viable for commercialization after this project,” Pereira added.
Évora’s historical center residents are reportedly open to installing the BIPV solutions, despite their lower efficiency and higher price than standard rooftop PV.
“Our expectation, for now, is that these solutions can be a reality within the historic center, and in the near future, that the residents themselves can also have access to this type of solution,” Nuno Bilo, mechanical engineer at Évora’s city hall told pv magazine. “The feedback we have from residents is that regardless of the efficiency of the tiles, they are interested in installing these BIPV solutions – it is better to have this than nothing.”
To facilitate citizen engagement in and outside the city’s historical center, the Pocityf project also includes peer-to-peer energy trading, collective self-consumption for municipal buildings, and a platform where private citizens can register to sell or buy self-produced electricity.
The city hall is also drafting a tender for the concession of a community solar farm in Évora. The winning bidder should develop renewable energy on public land while guaranteeing a price per kWh lower than the spot market for citizens living in the historic center of Évora.
The Pocityf project started in October 2019 and is due to end in June 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/30/key-takeaways-from-italys-k-ey-energy-trade-show/,"EVENTS,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 30, 2023",Key takeaways from Italy’s K.EY Energy trade show,"Italy's leading solar event, K.EY Energy, has finally forged its own identity as the country's main event for solar and renewables. For years confined within the context of a broader event, the Ecomondo trade show for the green economy, the K.EY Energy fair is now living a life of its own. It can no longer be seen as a small, regional event.
The fair, held in Rimini last week, involved around 600 companies, of which 28% were from other countries, according to the organizer, the Italian Exhibition Group (IEG). With 12 pavilions, the fair has doubled its size, as well as the number of visitors, IEG said, without providing specific figures. However, a comparison with previous years is not possible because the event was still part of the Ecomondo show.
“It seems we went back to the times of the old Solarexpo,” Alberto Cuter,  general manager at JinkoSolar, told pv magazine, in reference to a successful solar event that was held in Italy during the early stages of the nation's solar industry.
Andrea Brumgnach, vice president of the Italia Solare PV association, says the success of the event reflects the strong growth that the country saw in terms of volumes and deals between last year and the first months of 2023.
“We are seeing an atmosphere of revival of the solar sector at this event,” he said. “It has now an unprecedented national and international relevance and we waited years for this to happen.”
Brumgnach said Italy may install between 3 GW and 4 GW of new PV capacity in 2023, after hitting a remarkable 2.48 GW last year.
“Much will depend on the new technical rules that will have to be issued in the next months,” he added. “It is important, however, that we will be able to install between 7 GW and 8 GW per year if we want to reach the goals of Italy's energy strategy by 2030.”
Alberto Pinori – the president of ANIE Rinnovabili, an Italian renewable energy association – was also satisfied with the outcome of K.EY Energy.
“The event is finally gaining authority and filling a gap,” he stated. “We see all the supply chain here. There are installers, developers and manufacturers and we also saw many interesting conferences.”
He said the fair mirrors the current growth of the Italian renewable energy market.
“The large-scale solar segment is now gaining importance compared to the previous years,” he said, noting how all industry bodies are now joining forces more frequently to urge the government to simplify and streamline permitting processes.
The show attracted most major Chinese solar module makers, as well as the largest European and Asian inverter manufacturers. The presence of several Italian module manufacturers – including Sunerg, Trienergia, and FuturaSun – also indicated that demand for solar products made in Europe could soon reach new heights, thanks to the REPower EU initiative.
All in all, the K.EY Energy trade show has fostered optimism in the Italian PV industry.
“We have now good reasons to be optimists, but we should avoid frenzy and keep vigilant on all future developments about legislation,” said Brumgnach.

Fluctuations in energy costs can have a significant impact on a company’s bottom line, making it challenging to budget effectively and maintain a competitive edge. Fortunately, advancements in battery energy storage and solar are providing a solution to help hedge against energy price risks.
Image: GridBeyond
As pv magazine readers know, battery storage and PV systems work hand in hand to enable businesses to generate their own electricity and store excess energy for use during times of high demand or low sunlight. By leveraging these technologies, businesses can significantly reduce their reliance on grid electricity, which is often subject to volatile pricing structures.
Businesses that rely entirely on grid electricity are at the mercy of the energy market. When energy prices rise, their operating costs go up, which can have a significant impact on their profitability. By investing in battery storage and solar systems, businesses can generate their own electricity and reduce their reliance on the grid. This provides them with greater control over their energy costs and helps them avoid price spikes in the energy market. This much we know already, but how could that principle shape up in practice?
Let’s assume that a manufacturing fab in Victoria, Australia that has annual energy consumption of 8.76 GWh has installed a 2 MW solar system and a 1 MWh battery storage facility, connected in a microgrid. The average electricity price is AUD 0.27 ($0.18)/kWh and the site could earn revenue through participation in the Australian Energy Market Operator’s Wholesale Demand Response Mechanism (WDRM). The latter program enables consumers to respond to the needs of the grid by altering their electricity load profiles and pays them to do so, with payments varying from AUD 1.50 per kilowatt of reduced peak demand, to AUD 13/kW, based on 2022 prices and depending on the month.
If the manufacturing fab’s solar system generates electricity for six hours per day and the battery is charged and discharged once per day, here’s an estimate of the potential cost savings and revenues.
The solar system generates 13 MWh daily from the six hours its 2.17 MW generation capacity operates. The fab’s industrial load demand is 24 MWh per day but it only consumes 6 MWh of the power generated by the panels, due to the mismatch between solar generation hours and unit production activity. With the battery discharging a megawatt-hour per day for industrial use, the fab uses only 17 MWh per day of grid power, rather than 24 MWh, resulting in a daily cost saving of AUD 1,890 and monthly savings of around AUD 56,700.
On top of that, if the factory has peak power demand of 3 MW for an hour per day, using its microgrid and battery to reduce that peak load to 2 MW could bring in AUD 5,000 of monthly revenue, based on a WDRM weekday peak demand reduction payment of AUD 5/kW.
With production accounting for only 6 MWh of the 13 MWh generated by the solar array daily, and assigning a further megawatt-hour to charge the battery, the remaining 6 MWh could generate daily revenue of AUD 600 if sold to the grid for AUD 0.10/kWh, for an AUD 18,000 monthly revenue stream.
That all adds up to monthly energy saving and incentive payments of AUD 79,700 for our notional fab in Victoria.
This is, of course, a very stylized example and ignores factors such as actual load and solar-generation profiles, which will not be flat as assumed in the simple example discussed above, as well as arbitrage revenue opportunities that exist for the battery to further increase savings by avoiding peak grid electricity prices and selling back excess energy to the network at optimal times.
A battery can also earn revenue by participating in frequency control ancillary markets, which balance supply and demand in the event of unexpected generator failures in order to maintain frequency levels.
A more realistic representation of the interaction between load, solar, and battery storage is depicted in the diagram below.

Actual savings and revenues will depend on various factors such as the location, size, and type of installation; energy prices; and demand profiles in a specific region. The interaction of all these variables on any given day ensures the decision making process can become quite complex. Under such circumstances, it is useful to employ mathematical optimization programming to achieve the best outcome and derive the greatest return on investment. The critical point to note is that a battery co-located with solar changes the risk profile of the investment, ensuring that some of the uncertainties associated with weather-based power generation are, at least in part, mitigated.
Battery storage and solar systems offer businesses an innovative solution to hedge against energy price risks. By generating their own electricity, reducing their reliance on the grid, and storing excess energy, businesses can significantly reduce energy costs and improve their energy efficiency. Moreover, investing in these technologies can help businesses increase their energy independence, reduce their carbon footprint, and contribute to a more sustainable future.
With these benefits in mind, it is clear battery storage and solar are an essential investment for businesses looking to hedge against energy price risks and remain competitive in an ever-changing market.

Advancing the “trojan horse” play Brookfield initiated last year with its bid for AGL, the Canadian group and its partners have brokered a $18.7 billion deal to buyout Origin Energy, Australia’s second-largest energy generator and retailer.
While its target has changed from AGL to Origin Energy over the last 12 months, Brookfield’s strategy of using a major established energy company to accelerate decarbonisation at a globally significant scale remains the same. Under Brookfield and its newly revealed fellow investors, Singapore's GIC and Temasek, the business plan is to invest “at least” AUS 20 billion over the next decade to construct up to 14 GW of new renewable capacity.
To put those numbers in perspective, this represents about one-fifth of the what the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) says will be needed by 2030 to reach national targets. Brookfield also plans to reduce Origin’s absolute emissions by more than 70% by 2030. A decent chunk of this reduction will come from the closure of the Eraring coal-fired power station in New South Wales, slated for retirement in 2025 at the earliest.
During his campaign ahead of the New South Wales state election in Australia on March 23, then-opposition Labor leader Chris Minns said he would be open to buying back the 2.8 GW coal generator. With Minn’s election over the weekend, Brookfield has not closed the door to this proposition, but its Asia Pacific CEO Stewart Upson told the Australian Financial Review that such a deal would need to fit into Brookfield’s decarbonisation vision.
The buyout will see Brookfield, GIC and Temasek take over Origin’s retail and generation business, which currently has a 24% market share in Australia’s national electricity market. Meanwhile, partner MidOcean Energy, managed by US investment giant EIG Partners, will take control of Origin’s gas assets and business.
After months of due diligence and negotiations, the consortium has entered into a Scheme Implementation Deed with Origin to purchase 100% of its shares at $8.91 per share, a premium on current trading prices. While the deal must be approved by shareholders, it also still has to be looked over by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).
As Brookfield is Canadian-owned, a member country of the Five Eyes security alliance, it is not anticipated to encounter too many roadblocks from the Foreign Investment Review Board. The ACCC, on the other hand, could prove problematic, especially given Brookfield’s recent takeover of Victorian network AusNet Services.

In the study “Ink Design Enabling Slot-Die Coated Perovskite Solar Cells with >22% Power Conversion Efficiency, Micro-Modules, and 1 Year of Outdoor Performance Evaluation,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials, the researchers said that they used a formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) precursor ink based on 2-methoxyethanol in the slot-die coating process.
Slot-die is a coating process used to deposit thin and uniform films with limited material waste and low operational costs.
“The slot-die coating is one of the most promising processes enabling sheet-to-sheet, continuous roll-to-roll coating, and solution-processable optoelectronic device technology such as organic electronic devices and polymer solar cells,” the team said, noting the industry commonly uses spin-coating for perovskite cell production.
The researchers said the new precursor ink method is aimed at preventing the so-called ribbing effects that usually arise in perovskite solar devices with slot-die and cause irregular shapes in the deposited wet perovskite films.
“Ribbing is a common effect observed at the downstream meniscus when the viscous and capillary forces between ink, slot-die, and substrate are unbalanced,” they stated.
They adjusted the ink viscosity via acetonitrile (ACN) with a 46% concentration. The compound acted as a co-solvent for the FAPbI3 thin-film and improved its quality and layer homogeneity.
The German group utilized this technique in a small-area solar cell, which achieved a power conversion efficiency of 22.54%, which it said is the highest certified value for a slot-die-coated perovskite solar cell to date. The device also reached an open-circuit voltage of 1.088 V, a short-circuit current of 24.9 mA cm2, and a fill factor of 83.1%. Germany's Fraunhofer ISE CalLab confirmed this result.
The team also built mini-modules with active areas of 12.7 cm2 and an efficiency of 17.1%.
“A full year of outdoor stability testing with continuous maximum power point tracking on encapsulated devices is performed and it is demonstrated that these devices maintain close to 100% of their initial performance during winter and spring followed by a significant performance decline during warmer summer months,” said the researchers.
Looking forward, the academics plan to scale the technology to larger device areas and assess the performance under different long-term exposure conditions.

Redox-flow battery specialist Redflow has announced a strategic relationship through which it will supply United States-headquartered renewable energy asset developer Ameresco with its battery energy storage technology for use in commercial and industrial (C&I) settings.
Ameresco, which specialises in designing renewable energy solutions for C&I customers, said it plans to deploy Redflow’s zinc-bromine flow batteries as part of a “flexible and modular” integrated solar and storage solution to meet the increasing need in the market for medium- and long-duration systems.
Ameresco Chief Financial Officer Doran Hole said the partnership with Redflow aligns with the company’s “pursuit of best-fit solutions for our customers, both in project design and technology fit … The demand for longer-duration energy storage is a critical and rapidly growing market opportunity that can unlock our customers’ ability to cost-effectively meet an increasing amount of their energy needs through renewable sources.”
Brisbane-based Redflow said it is already working with Ameresco to deploy a commercial demonstration system incorporating one of the company’s 40 kWh four-battery enclosures at one of Ameresco’s existing customer sites.
Redflow Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Tim Harris said the four-battery enclosure is a compact, scalable energy storage solution for smaller C&I customers and allows Ameresco to look beyond conventional lithium technologies.
Harris said the integrated system delivers a fire-safe, rugged, and sustainable solution that is economically competitive with lithium-ion and offers operational advantages in a wide range of environments and operating conditions.
“Our zinc-bromine flow battery offers a non-lithium solution that is fire safe, has an innovative hibernation feature, and suits a wide range of environments and use cases,” he said.
Ameresco and Redflow said they are also planning to build upon Redflow’s existing enclosure system to offer a utility-scale solution that is scalable into the hundreds of MWh.
Harris said he expects the collaboration with Ameresco, which comes just months after Redflow signed a deal to work with US-based renewables developer Empower Energies, will pave the way for greater expansion in the North American market.
“We hope our partnering with Ameresco will initiate other exciting opportunities for our business pipeline and, over time, new markets globally,” he said.

Swift Current Energy, a Boston-based solar and wind project developer, has kicked off construction on the Double Black Diamond solar project in Illinois, an 800 MW(DC) utility-scale solar project that could become the largest solar project in the United States and the first to use only US-made modules, hardware and electrical components.
The project is scheduled for construction by the fall of 2024, and it will be owned by the developer once it is operational. First Solar is providing 1.6 million US-made solar panels and Nextracker is supplying US-made tracking systems for the project.
The developer recently tapped McCarthy Building Companies as the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor on the project. Construction is expected to last 14 months.
The project checks off a few additional boxes for US Inflation Reduction Act initiatives and rebates. The project has set apprenticeship, as well as diversity, equity, and inclusion hiring goals, which are being facilitated with local unions for carpenters, laborers, operators, electricians, and crew leads.
In partnership with local unions, McCarthy will train workers who are inexperienced in utility-scale solar construction to assist with future workforce needs and accommodate the exponential regional and national growth of the solar industry. Once operational, Double Black Diamond will provide enough clean energy equivalent to more than 85,000 Illinois households per year.
In collaboration with Constellation Energy, an Exelon company, the city of Chicago will be a key offtake customer. Starting in 2025, the city will partially source its large energy uses such as Chicago O’Hare International Airport and Midway International Airport with renewable energy from Double Black Diamond. The project is expected to bring $100 million in tax revenue to the Counties of Sangamon and Morgan counties, where the project is located.
