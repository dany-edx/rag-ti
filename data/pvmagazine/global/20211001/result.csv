EBH2’s proprietary low-cost electrolysis technology can produce green hydrogen “from virtually any water source including salt water.” The companies reported that a first step was taken by the signing of a perpetual worldwide license granted by EBH2 to HPQ to sell products where EBH2 Green Hydrogen Reactors (EBH2 GHR) are incorporated into HPQ Technologies. “We are getting closer to the point where EBH2 technology will be validated and HPQ will be incredibly well positioned to make green silicon materials all the while opening up new, and massive addressable markets for a system that can produce cheaply green hydrogen, on demand,” Bernard Tourillon, president and CEO of HPQ Silicon, said on Wednesday. The aim is to produce green hydrogen for $1 per kilogram.
Italian gas transmission operator Snam and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) signed a partnership agreement aimed at developing green hydrogen globally. “Snam will contribute by leveraging on its expertise and best practices in transporting energy across its over 40,000 km of pipelines as well as on its role as a member of the Green Hydrogen Catapult initiative, aimed at accelerating the scale of green hydrogen 50-fold in the next five years,” Marco Alverà, CEO of Snam, commented on Wednesday. Snam also signed an MoU with Italy's Iris Ceramica Group for an industrial project involving the study and development of the “world’s first ceramics factory powered by green hydrogen.” A 2.5 MW PV plant will be installed on the roof of Iris Ceramica’s new factory. It will be combined with an electrolyzer and a storage system for the renewable hydrogen that will be produced on site. The new Iris Ceramica Group production site in Castellarano is scheduled to be completed by 2022.
Missouri-based engineering company Emerson and New Mexico-headquartered chemical reactor company BayoTech announced on Thursday a multi-year framework agreement to accelerate the production and distribution of hydrogen. “Emerson will deliver advanced automation technologies, software and products to enable BayoTech to build hundreds of hydrogen units to produce cleaner, lower-cost hydrogen,” reads the press release. BayoTech’s modular hydrogen generation units reportedly produce up to 1,000 kilograms per day. “Emerson’s advanced technology is the right choice to support our vision of disrupting the established centralized hydrogen supply chain with a new, highly efficient model of local autonomous production hubs,” commented BayoTech CEO Mo Vargas.
Arizona-based zero-emission vehicle company Nikola and New York's Opal Fuels, which focuses on renewable fueling infrastructure for heavy-duty truck fleets, entered into a memorandum of understanding on the development, construction, and operation of hydrogen fueling stations in North America and the use of renewable natural gas (RNG) in hydrogen production. “Under this strategic engagement, Nikola and Opal Fuels intend to co-develop and co-market hydrogen refueling infrastructure to accelerate the adoption of heavy-duty zero-emission fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEV),” the companies wrote on Thursday.
French automotive supplier Plastic Omnium and French train manufacturer Alstom signed a memorandum of understanding to develop high-end hydrogen storage systems for the railway sector. “A dedicated team has been set up to manage the technical and commercial development of innovative and competitive hydrogen onboard storage solutions for the railway market,” Alstom stated. The two partners want to launch hydrogen storage solutions for regional trains in France and Italy starting in 2022. “The planned combination of Plastic Omnium’s expertise in hydrogen storage solutions and our expertise in hydrogen trains is in this regard an important milestone to build an innovative and strong hydro rail value chain,” commented Thierry Best, Alstom's chief commercial officer.
Ardian, a French private investment house, and FiveT Hydrogen, a clean-hydrogen enabling investment platform, announced a partnership to create Hy24, an equally owned joint venture. “Hy24 will become the world’s largest investment platform focused on clean hydrogen infrastructure, designed to invest in projects that are critical to global decarbonization,” Ardian wrote on Friday. French oil and gas company TotalEnergies, industrial gases company Air Liquide, and concessions and construction company Vinci pledged to invest €100 million each as anchor investors.“The fund aims to reach €1.5 billion and has already secured initial commitments of €800 million. Its objective is to accelerate the growth of the clean hydrogen ecosystem by investing in large strategic projects and leveraging the alliance of industrial and financial players,” TotalEnergies wrote on Friday. For now, the focus is on the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Lotte Chemical, AXA, Groupe ADP, Ballard, EDF, and Schaeffler also intend to join the initiative. “Subject to Hy24’s French Market Authority (AMF) accreditation as an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM), the platform will be operational in late 2021 and first closing is expected before the end of the year.”
A group of academics in the United Kingdom wrote to the government that hydrogen should not have an immediate impact on emissions or jobs, at least not within the next decade. According to the letter published in mid-September, the government should take a cautious approach to blue hydrogen, avoiding lock-in to unsustainable fossil fuel infrastructure that could push net-zero out of reach, while supporting the use of hydrogen in specific sectors, like steel, chemicals and shipping. “We are concerned that the UK government is considering widespread use of hydrogen in home heating, despite the availability of electric heat pumps that are more efficient and can already deploy at scale today, supporting thousands of jobs,” reads the letter by the experts, led by Cambridge University Professor David Cebon.

The main reason for the price increase was a 100% jump in silicon costs,  due to stalling production caused by power shortages that affected China last week. According to the China Silicon Association, two of the total 12 major polysilicon manufacturers are experiencing annual overhauls and won’t return to normal production until late October. The total output of China’s polysilicon in September was 42,800 metric tons, up slightly from August. In October, polysilicon output will not surpass the figures of the last two months and prices are expected to continue to rise, the association said.
Wind developer Mingyang Smart Energy said on Wednesday that it has signed an agreement with the government of Yancheng, Jiangsu province, to build a 5 GW heterojunction solar cell factory. The plant will be built in two 2.5 GW phases and will produce solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of more than 24.5%. The two sides will invest CNY 5 billion in the project.
Polysilicon manufacturer Xinte Energy said on Tuesday that it has raised CNY 2.29 billion by issuing stock to controlling shareholder TBEA. The solar manufacturer is raising its majority stake from 62% to 67% in Xinte, with CNY 2 billion to go into the construction of 100,000 tons of annual poly fab capacity. The remainder will kept for working capital, said Xinte.
Polysilicon manufacturer GCL-Poly said this week that it will “soon” publish the findings of an investigation into a CNY 510 million pre-payment it made in 2019 for a silicon project that was never built. The matter prompted the resignation of  Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu as its auditor in May. Trading in GCL-Poly shares has been suspended since the company’s failure to publish its 2020 figures by the end of March, but the company has vowed to submit its figures for last year and the first half of this year in the coming weeks. The company also said it “accepts the internal control consultant’s findings and recommendations and is in the process of taking steps to address those recommendations,” as it has turned to an independent party to examine its processes. That decision followed the discovery that the general manager responsible for approving the contentious pre-payment had done so against company policy. GCL-Poly has already acknowledged that it failed to report the the engineering, procurement and construction services contract related to the 2019 payment, in breach of stock market regulations.
Solar manufacturer JinkoSolar said this week that the application of its main Jinko Solar Co Ltd subsidiary for a listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s Sci-Tech innovation board has been approved by the exchange’s stock listing committee. Jinko Solar will now have to register with the China Securities Regulatory Commission before the initial public offering can take place.
State-owned solar developer China Shuifa Singyes Energy announced plans this week to spend CNY 103 million on a 2 MW, distributed-generation solar system at a sewage plant. The investment also includes a 25 MW “fishery-solar” project and 20 1 MW blocks of solar, with the latter capacity to be installed by a company that also deals in computer software, herbs, livestock and poultry. Shandong Shuifa Clean Energy, which is owned by the Shuifa Group water industry entity that also owns China Shuifa Singyes, will sell the projects. The acquisition still needs to be approved by the independent shareholders of China Shuifa Singyes. It has promised to release the details of the special general meeting that will be needed for the vote by Oct. 25.
Solar developer Shunfeng International suspended trading in its shares on Monday morning, pending the announcement of a “very substantial transaction.” It later said it would provide the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with details of a “very substantial disposal of the company” by Oct. 29. Shunfeng International is selling off its solar farms to pay down creditors and has already announced a current-assets-to-liabilities deficit of CNY 2.67 billion.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/01/hybrid-fuel-cell-battery-storage-system-for-solar-applications/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,THAILAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 1, 2021",Hybrid fuel cell-battery storage system for solar applications,"A group of scientists from the Chiang Mai University in Thailand has designed a hybrid storage system based on a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell and a battery and has sought to identify its best DC coupling voltage.
Intended for use in solar PV applications, the system was built with a 4.8 kW hybrid inverter provided by Taiwan-based Voltronic Power Technology Corp, a 250 W PV unit consisting of three cells in series in four parallel connections, a lead-acid AGM battery 2 V from Chinese manufacturer MCA, an electrolyzer and a 3 kW polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell from Taiwanese manufacturer M-Field.
Under this configuration, hydrogen is generated by tapping an AC 220 V power line to the electrolyzer and is then stored in a high-pressure tank. The electrolyzer can produce 500 L/h and a maximum pressure of 32 bar. The voltage output between the fuel cell and battery was linked through a DC bus bar. The battery has a storage capacity of 50 kWh and the capacity of the electrolyzer is 2,180 L at 30 bar
“The data were recorded in real time during the experiment,” the scientists specified. “This work assumes that the battery capacity is sufficiently large, where the hydrogen capacity is limited.” The turn-on voltage of fuel cell operation was set at 48 V and the turn-off voltages were set at 49, 50, 51 and 52 V.
The testing showed that, with a voltage difference of 4 V, only the batteries supplied power to the load until the voltage declined to 48 V. “After that, the fuel cell started to work and provided mainly power to the load until the hydrogen was used up,” the academics further explained. “There was no transition period where the fuel cell and batteries provided power simultaneously.” The total time duration of this range reached 795 minutes.
When the voltage difference was 3 V, the duration of the range was 645 minutes and when the difference was 2 V, the transition time between the batteries and fuel cell was longer at 920 minutes. The longest operating time of 1,350 minutes was achieved with a voltage difference of 1 V. The scientists explained, however, that the voltage profile dropped below that for the turn-on voltage of the fuel cell. “This indicates the malfunction of the controller and possible failure of the system,” they emphasized. “Hence, the optimum voltage difference during the on-off operation of the fuel cell was set at 2 V, where the storage performed with the longest time without damaging the system.”
The group also ascertained that the fuel cell's turn on-off with 49–51 V is the best range for optimizing its operation. In this way, the fuel cell and batteries facilitate each other and the overall system remains stable.
The system is described in the study “Optimal voltage of direct current coupling for a fuel cell–battery hybrid energy storage system based on solar energy,” published in Energy Reports.

This follows the company's close of $4 million series A funding round in 2020, led by a $3 million investment from ARCH. In an interview with pv magazine, Sun Exchange CEO Abraham Cambridge explains the company's expansion plans.
Congratulations on securing the $2.5 million convertible note financing from ARPF. What's the general feeling about this?
It's hugely exciting. We have grown hugely and done the biggest crowd-sourced project in African history in Zimbabwe. We closed our Series A investment last June. Since then, we have doubled our user base, and our existing investors have seen the promise and potential in our model, and they have doubled down on their investment through this convertible note to enable us to keep growing.
The timing is perfect for the product we are bringing to the market. More and more people are switching to solar, and we are the company to enable that. In the past couple of years, we have deployed and managed to fund $5.5 million worth of solar projects for the EPCs and project developers we work with, and that's through COVID. What we can bring in over the next couple of years is hugely exciting.
How will you manage and use the funds?
It's going to be used to enable our expansion into the rest of Africa. We will double down on our business development efforts in Namibia, Botswana, and potentially East and West Africa. We welcome with open arms any EPC or project developers that would like to work with Sun Exchange to get their project funded and built.
How do you plan to scale?
We want to deploy 1 GW over the next five years. Currently, we are at around 7 MW. We are on the trajectory of doing that. Our goal is 1 GW in five years across 10 countries.
Which new countries are you targeting to venture in?
We have our largest project in Zimbabwe for [the agricultural company] Nhimbe Fresh, a fantastic project. We are actively exploring projects in other African countries, but we are still appraising which countries to go into.
What's the current status of the Nhimbe Fresh project?
The solar installation is complete; we are waiting for the battery to be installed. The system will be live and operating in October.
What have you learned from the first phase of the Nhimbe Fresh project?
It's been an interesting experience working in Zimbabwe. We are building a high voltage mini-grid. We have learned how understanding the Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (ZERA) and Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) are very helpful in getting the project live and getting the generation license applied for the next phase.
What's been interesting is how open and welcoming the national utility is to enable the rollout of embedded solar. That is an indication that the rest of Africa is welcoming solar with open arms.
Do you have other projects, ongoing or new?
We have a project live now — a plastic recycling facility is open on our platform now. We have a school project launching after that, and then we have the second phase of Nhimbe Fresh coming soon.
What do you think about the African Energy Market?
This is the biggest opportunity in the economic history of Africa. The amount of money worldwide committed to investing in clean technology and to fight climate change is in the trillions of dollars. The only way African nations can develop sustainably is by going solar, and there are trillions of dollars in the world looking to invest in projects to enable that. Sun Exchange is in the front line to enable those funds across the globe to invest in solar projects in Africa.
The timing is perfect. The technology is now very well developed. The cost is completely economically viable in every market. So, we can very quickly deploy reliable, clean, and affordable solar electricity anywhere on the continent.
What's next for Sun Exchange?
Our goal is to deploy 1 GW in the next five years and further expand our user base. We have members in 180 countries, and we are currently appraising countries to start projects.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/01/closed-loop-pumped-hydro-on-the-rise/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 1, 2021",Closed-loop pumped hydro on the rise,"Closed-loop pumped hydro storage projects are seeing growing interest compared to open-loop systems, as they provide more environmental benefits and find more acceptance among residents, administrations, and governments.
This is one of the main conclusions of the paper “Drivers and barriers to the deployment of pumped hydro energy storage applications: Systematic literature review,” published by researchers of Australia's Griffith University in Cleaner Engineering and Technology.
In the study, the scientists explained that compared to open-loop pumped hydro facilities, closed-loop projects offer more environmental benefits and overcome the problem of finding suitable sites. The latter, in fact, are located away from rivers and do not involve connection to a natural water source to create a lower reservoir. The former, by contrast, has an ongoing hydrologic connection to a natural body of water like a river or a lake.
“This study also discovered that there was a growing interest in the closed-loop system due to greater certainty in gaining an operating license, since closed systems don't interfere with water supply security and typically have a lower environmental impact,” the researchers stated. On the other hand, the paper identifies landscape topology and land acquisition among the main techno-environmental barriers that prevent pumped hydro to gain more market shares.
“Land acquisition challenges, such as land use, vegetation clearing and land ownership, are environmental complications of pumped hydro development,” the paper notes. “There must be no interference in protected lands or forests, river systems, urban or rural settlements or intensive agriculture, national parks, or areas of historical or cultural value.”  According to the Australian group, violating these principles may complicate significantly the development of a project.
According to another study published last year by scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), the number of preliminary permits and licensing applications for closed-loop systems has considerably increased in recent years.
The US team analyzed, in particular, the US Energy Regulatory Commission’s licensing record to assess the potential environmental effects of six closed-loop projects and compare these data with those four existing open-loop systems. Their analysis showed that closed-loop systems offer more opportunities to minimize environmental effects to aquatic and terrestrial habitats. “The aquatic resources evaluated included surface water quality and quantity, groundwater quality and quantity, and aquatic ecology,” the group specified. “Terrestrial resources included geology and soils, terrestrial ecology, land use, recreation, visual resources, and cultural resources.”
“For the most part, our study confirmed the conventional wisdom that closed-loop pumped hydro projects generally have fewer and less widespread environmental impacts than open-loop projects because they’re located offstream and have greater siting flexibility,” said PNNL researcher Bo Saulsbury.
The academics, however, warned that some closed-loop systems may utilize groundwater to fill and replenish their reservoirs, which is not without environmental effects on geology, soils, and groundwater quantity. Closed-loop projects using groundwater as the source for initial filling of their reservoirs and replacing evaporative and seepage losses may impact groundwater quality due to the effects on groundwater circulation patterns and chemistry,” the paper notes. “Impacts to groundwater quantity resulting from the large quantities of water necessary for reservoir fill and refill could reduce the availability of groundwater for other uses.
Another group of researchers from Australia recently identified 616,818 locations throughout the world that could be suitable sites for 23.1 million GWh of closed-loop pumped-hydro storage capacity. The academics stated that “off-river” pumped-hydro projects are able to overcome the typical topographical issues of conventional pumped-hydro, as the size of reservoirs is relatively small, ranging from tens to hundreds of hectares. This limited size also reduces the need to manage large flood events and ensures considerably lower construction costs.

The solar industry has recently begun to take more action in this area, with new and more durable backsheet construction and encapsulant materials gaining market share. And for backsheets in particular, repair methods have been introduced that could eliminate the need for more costly replacement of modules or even an entire power plant.
These repair methods, however, depend on spotting the problem early enough to intervene before irreversible damage has been caused – a challenge particularly in large-scale projects, and one that can require costly inspection of the modules, and even the need to remove them from the installation and transport to a lab for testing.
With this in mind, scientists led by the Helmholtz Institute Erlangen-Nürnberg for Renewable Energy (HI ERN), in Germany investigated the use of near-infrared transmission analysis on modules in the field, and found that the analysis allowed them to identify four different types of backsheet in a megawatt-sized solar park, and also showed that for one type at least, degradation mechanisms affecting the backsheet altered the near-infrared transmission spectrum, allowing them to spot degraded backsheets in the field without more invasive/destructive analysis.
“Solar-NIRT is relatively fast, non-invasive, selective, can be upgraded to a non-contact regime making it a promising tool for high-throughput characterization,” stated the group. The method is described in full in the paper Solar-NIRT: Identification of PV-module backsheets in the field with natural sunlight, published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
“As the characteristic vibration bands of many PV-relevant polymers do not overlap with the absorption bands of atmospheric gases (H2O, CO2), we were able to distinguish between four exemplary BS types found on a multi-MW power plant used for testing the method,” stated the group, further explaining its approach. “Additionally, degradation signs were detected for one of the BS types showing the potential of such “Solar-NIRT” spectroscopy for evaluating the degradation status of the module BSs.”
Based on the results achieved so far, the group expects to see its method developed into a large-scale process either fully automated or human-assisted, that is able to characterize large-scale PV installations and track degradation of polymer-based backsheets and encapsulants.

Mondragon Assembly, a Spanish PV production equipment supplier, has secured a licensing agreement for its continuous string process.
“The deal was made with one of the most relevant players in the solar industry,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine, without disclosing the name of the manufacturer.
This license is for its patent for its continuous string process, which has been its intellectual property since 2013. Mondragon Assembly claims the patent “offers results never before seen in the manufacture of strings.”
Several years ago, the Basque machinery manufacturer faced a legal dispute with a solar machinery manufacturer. The Chinese court ultimately ruled in favor of Mondragon Assembly.
The patented process is a manufacturing technique for continuous string processing, which purportedly eliminates the adverse effects derived from “first” and “last” cells. In this process, a cut is applied between two cells to create individual strings from an infinite string.
According to Mondragon Assembly, this system increases the productivity of stringing machines by 10%. In addition, it provides control over the ribbon/wire at all times, which increases the quality of the alignment and reduces the number of defective strings.

A new KPMG report suggests that Australia’s energy landscape is set to undergo a major transformation before the end of the decade, with the growth in renewables and energy storage to accelerate, the closure of coal-fired power plants to be well advanced, and the introduction of emerging zero-emissions technologies – including green hydrogen – to ramp up.
The 30 Voices on 2030: The Future of Energy report asked 30 energy industry executives, experts and government figures to look ahead and predict the state of the Australian energy landscape in 2030. As part of the report, KPMG Australia also conducted a survey of 240 energy and natural resources (ENR) businesses in Australia.
Cassandra Hogan, KPMG Australia's ENR industry leader, said the conversation about Australia’s energy transition and decarbonization has accelerated over the past year. The report serves to highlight the key drivers in the nation’s transition to net-zero emissions.
“The industry is undergoing a profound transformation,” she said. “Supply of energy is shifting to renewables and lower-emissions fuels. Consumers and industrial users are becoming more active participants in the energy market. They are choosing, even demanding, new technologies, products and data to meet their needs. We’re on that journey but having experts imagine the future can help us get on and stay on the right path.”
Hogan said the report highlights the role technology will play in Australia’s accelerating shift to renewable energy with almost three-quarters, or 74% of those ENR businesses surveyed agreeing that most households will be actively using smart energy monitoring by the end of the decade.
“Consumers will be at the centre of the energy transition, with technology transforming their relationship with the system,” she said.
About 59% of those surveyed said they agree that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations will have been incorporated into core business strategies and specific targets will be law in 2030. Hogan said the report also highlights the role rooftop solar PV will play in the clean energy transition, with 69% of those surveyed agreeing that most Australian businesses and households will have shifted to solar and battery storage in 2030.
Energy Minister Angus Taylor said he expects rooftop solar to continue to play a major role in Australia’s energy future. Hydrogen will also be more economically competitive by 2030 and will help cut emissions in multiple industries, he claimed.
“Australia’s energy and natural resources sectors have evolved and reduced emissions much faster than we expected a decade ago,” Taylor said when asked what the energy landscape would look like in 2030. “The extraordinary uptake of renewables, particularly household solar, towards the end of the 2010s, has been matched by huge growth in the 2020s of a range of new low-emissions energy technologies. Energy sources like hydrogen are becoming more competitive with existing technologies, driving down emissions and producing affordable, reliable energy.”
Australia Industry Group Chief Executive Innes Willox said that he expects that by 2030, households and businesses will have been the major drivers of changes in the energy system while big industry will still have a way to go.
“The transformation in heavy industry is yet to come, but we should see this over this next decade to 2040,” he said of the energy landscape in 2030. “Most households and smaller businesses are now at the point where the scale of renewable power generation and battery technology is enabling energy consumption to be more of an individual choice. Their power generation is cheaper, there are more choices of types of renewable generation and technologies, such as batteries, and inverters are allowing them to better manage and customise what they need or don’t need.”
While the predictions of those surveyed for the report vary on what the energy landscape will look like in 2030, KPMG Australia Energy Transition Leader Barry Sterland said one thing they all agree on is that change is coming, and it is coming quickly.
“The domestic and international policy landscape shifted even in the time this publication was in preparation,” he said. “Energy firms need to get ahead of this change to seize the opportunities arising from this rapid change – and to avoid the risk of being left behind.”

Once completed, the project will be the largest solar installation in the UK, and among the largest in Europe.
The project, earlier called Cleve Hill Solar Farm and now named ‘Project Fortress’ by its new owner, has been in planning stages since 2017, and received consent from the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, as a nationally significant infrastructure project, in May 2020. Quinbrook expects to begin construction in the first half of 2021.
“We believe Project Fortress is a landmark transaction on many fronts and represents a new frontier in UK solar teamed with large scale battery storage,” said Quinbrook co-founder Rory Quinlan. “We have been immersed in large scale solar and storage in the US for many years and we can apply our significant experience in project design and equipment selection to ensure Fortress becomes the new benchmark for renewables that support the UK grid rather than challenge it.”
Quinbrook has plenty of experience in large-scale solar, currently developing the 690 MW PV / 380 MW battery storage Gemini project, and another 600 MW project in Nevada, United States. As well as integrating battery storage to ensure minimal disruption to the grid, the project promises features to certify its output for offtakers keen to keep track of their carbon footprint. “Fortress provides a timely opportunity to showcase the application of advanced technologies that are critical to verify the carbon reductions available to our customers from Fortress,” added Quinlan. “We think this is destined to become the standard for all energy supply projects in the years ahead.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/01/arevon-energy-taps-tesla-for-2-gw-6-gwh-of-storage-supply/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"OCTOBER 1, 2021",Arevon Energy taps Tesla for 2 GW/6 GWh of storage supply,"From pv magazine USA
Arevon Energy said that it has purchased 2 GW/6 GWh of Tesla Megapacks through a master supply agreement, in support of its growing utility-scale storage portfolio.
It did not disclose the purchase price, but this is not the first deal between the two companies. Arevon Energy said it expects to install 250 MW/1,000 MWh of Tesla Megapack energy storage systems in California and Nevada by the end of the year.
“This agreement ensures that Arevon can deliver near-term storage solutions to our customers, mitigating the risk of supply shortages and project delays,” said Justin Johnson, Arevon Energy's chief operating officer.
The storage units are expected to support the Falcon portfolio, a joint undertaking of Arevon Energy and energy company Tenaska to develop standalone storage projects in California load centers over the next four years. The facilities can be configured to provide up to four hours of battery-delivered energy during peak times of day. Well-sited standalone battery systems improve local reliability and can help prevent grid outages.
About a month ago, Arevon Energy and Nextracker signed a supply agreement for Nextracker to supply NX Horizon smart solar trackers with TrueCapture and NX Navigator software and control systems, for a 1.5 GW portfolio of projects in Indiana and Nevada. Of the seven projects, which are all expected to be operational by the end of 2023, five are located in Indiana: Elliott (200 MW), Gibson (280 MW), Ratts 1 and Ratts 2 (both 150 MW), and Posey (300 MW). The 250 MW Citadel project will be located outside of Reno, Nevada, and the 232 MW Townsite plant will be in Boulder City, Nevada.
