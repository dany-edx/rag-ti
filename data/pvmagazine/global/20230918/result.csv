This was lower than the 9.6 GW in the same period in 2022, but higher than the 4.8 GW imported in the first half of 2021.
Canadian Solar and JinkoSolar were the top suppliers in the Brazilian market, exporting 1,291 MW and 1,214 MW, respectively, in the first half of the year. They were followed by Longi (759 MW), Risen (721 MW), JA Solar (594 MW), Sunova (589 MW), Eging (454 MW), Trina (365 MW), Osda (219 MW), and DAH Solar (203 MW). In a market with 74 active brands, the top 10 module suppliers accounted for 85% of Brazilian imports.
Greener's said demand from large-scale projects offset the slowdown in the distributed-generation PV market between January and June, mitigating the decline in imports. Greener estimates that the volume of imports in the first half of the year is expected to lead to investments exceeding BRL25 billion ($5.1 billion).
“Despite the challenging first half of the year for the solar market, the drop in prices and the tendency to reduce interest rates bring a more favorable scenario for investment in own generation,” said Greener Director Marcio Takata.

The event this year is already far larger than any going back as far as 2018, and has a much bigger industrial presence than previous years, which have been dominated by Europe’s PV research institutes and universities, with only a few equipment suppliers making the journey. The return of industry players was underlined from the start, with the awarding of the Becquerel Prize to longtime PV industry leader and CEO of Meyer Burger, Gunter Erfurt.
Accepting the prize earlier today, Erfurt spoke of the need for an industry-wide change in attitude on several fronts including policies to compete with lower-priced imports making their way into Europe, and the handling of intellectual property. On the imports side, he called for incentives on the buyer side for use of European made products, and stressed that globally,  the solar industry must change its attitude to intellectual property to one that values innovation and the investment that comes with it, and accepts that making or buying products that copy another’s work are not an acceptable strategy.
Nevertheless, he stated confidently that Europe can produce solar modules for the rooftop and utility-scale markets, and achieve a levelized cost of energy very close to products imported from any region.
Discussions in the opening session carried on with this air of optimism, while also recognizing that solar faces big challenges both in Europe and globally. Speaking in a panel discussion, SolarPower Europe CEO Walburga Hemetsberger stated that European PV is on a good path, with continent-wide PV installations expected to reach eight terawatts by 2050. “We see growth, but we cannot be complacement” she told the audience in Lisbon.
Later, the difficult situation faced by European PV manufacturers was laid out in a presentation by the European Solar Manufacturing Council’s Johan Lindahl. He warned that average capacity utilization for factories in Europe has fallen to 35%, with some manufacturers sitting on inventories now too expensive to be sold – and the ESMC is calling for support from the EU, possibly in the form of a program to buy out these inventories and donate the modules to reconstruction efforts in Ukraine. “To be an EU manufacturer equals a major structural disadvantage,” Lindahl told the crowd in the first session after lunch today.
And the wave of new manufacturing facilities currently under construction in the United States is also being discussed as further impetus for the EU to take action in supporting a European industry: “The Inflation Reduction Act is wake up call for Europe,” said Hemetsberger. “All regions want the PV technology of the future, and Europe must get into that race.”
Much of the talk this morning has focused on the need for a policy overhaul to support solar at EU and state level. But EUPVSEC is traditionally a place where the latest PV technologies making their way out of Europe’s top R&D labs is showcased. And this year should be no different.
Talk of new applications and increased learnings on floating PV and agrivoltaics are emerging already as key themes: Also joining this morning’s panel discussion, Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore’s Thomas Reindl stated that both floating PV (including offshore) and agrivoltaics will be key enablers in keeping solar installations growing, as well as space for building-integrated PV, which has so far seemed more difficult to manufacture, but no less important.
The opening panel discussion also noted that European research institute’s have led the solar industry in achieving close to a 0.5% per year increase in module efficiency for more than 20 years, and maintaining, even improving on this will be a key theme for week-long conference. “Bigger leaps in technology are ahead of us,” said Reindl. “Every additional kilowatt-hour we can generate from the same space is precious.”

SECI is now accepting proposals to develop renewable energy projects with storage systems, all connected to the interstate transmission grid (ISTS). The projects will supply 1,260 MW of firm and dispatchable renewable power in a demand-following manner. They must be set up on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis in India.
A single developer can bid for 50 MW to 630 MW of cumulative contracted capacity, in multiples of 10 MW. 
SECI will sign 25-year power purchase agreements (PPA) with the successful bidders. SECI has provisioned 1,250 MW out of the total tendered capacity of 1,260 MW for sale to Delhi discoms BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd (BRPL) and BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL), while the remaining 10 MW has been allocated to GIFT Power Co. Ltd (GIFT PCL) in Gujarat.
“Bidders who have already commissioned RE plants/storage plants or are in the process of constructing such plants and have untied capacity may also participate under this RfS. In such case, they will be given the benefit of a longer period of PPA, commensurate to the duration between the actual date of commencement of supply of power and scheduled commencement of supply date,” said SECI.

A consortium led by Apollo Flutuantes has energized a floating PV system on a lake located in Estancia Jatobá, near Campinas, in the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo.
The system is being operated under the country's distributed generation (DG) scheme and sells excess power to the local grid.
The 69o W bifacial installation is equipped with a tracking system and rotates from East to West following the sun to maximize energy generation. It relies on solar modules provided by AE Solar.
“From the beginning, AE Solar carried out tests and discovered something that not even we knew, that the floating Apollo technology has an excellent albedo, of at least 17%,” the CEO of Apollo, José Alves Teixeira Filho, said.
The project also functions as a demonstrator for the standard 7 MW system developed and patented by Apollo, which is 180 meters wide by 280 meters long, with 9,000 bifacial modules. The system weighs approximately 1,200 tons floating, with a further 396 tons submerged for anchorage.
“It may seem simple, just a buoy, but it’s not. This ‘buoy’ has to last 30 years,” said Teixera Filho, noting that the interdisciplinary nature of the technologies requires the presence of several partners.
The idea of the consortium is to offer these units both to hydroelectric plant operators who want to hybridize their assets and to companies in the distributed generation segment.
“Exclusively for floating photovoltaics, it is allowed to build large plants installed, for example, with 300 MW on a lake, electrically sliced into 300 slices of up to 1 MW and negotiate this energy as distributed generation, directly with the end customer, which is prohibited for ground installations,” he also said. “This provides economic gains for floating plants very quickly. Just to give you an idea, a R$2 billion project has a payback period of less than three years,” he added.
He refers to Law 14,300, which in Brazil prohibits the division of a generating plant into smaller units to comply with the power limits for microgeneration or distributed minigeneration, except for floating plants, as long as each unit observes the maximum installed power limit.
Teixeira says that one of the models being studied by hydroelectric plants, in addition to the opportunity for hybridization, is to transfer parts of their reservoirs for exploration by other distributed generation companies, which can benefit from gains in scale and exploit the assets as distributed generation.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/18/urban-shadowing-on-solar-powered-vehicles/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"SEPTEMBER 18, 2023",Urban shadowing on solar-powered vehicles,"While an attractive proposition explored by startups and legacy car brands alike, the integration of solar cells into passenger vehicles is still in its infancy. Therefore, there is a lack of data quantifying the potential of vehicle integrated photovoltaics (VIPV) in real world conditions considering local solar irradiation and shadowing in urban environments.
Now, a group of researchers led by Lisbon-based Instituto Dom Luiz have modeled the potential of solar-powered vehicles with 1 kWp of PV on their rooftops for 100 cities across the world. Their findings showed that the median solar extended driving range is 18 km/day/kWp and 8 km/day/kWp for driving and parked vehicles, respectively.
Namely, they found that the solar extended driving range varies between 11 km/day/kWp and 29 km/day/kWp. According to the researchers, this is often of the same order of magnitude as daily commuting distances, enabling significant self-sufficiency for VIPV.
The researchers also found that the charging frequency ratio for solar-powered vehicle ranges from 0% to 80%, with a median of 57%.
“Higher (or lower) installed capacity would lead to a higher (or lower) extended driving range, but the effect on the charging frequency would not increase (or decrease) proportionally because it results from the difference between the extended driving range and the vehicle kilometers travelled,” the researchers said.
According to their findings, the most favorable geographies for VIPV include Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Nonetheless, the researchers underline that solar-powered mobility has relevant impact in reducing the charging frequency and lowering operational cost across the full sample of geographies, including China, Europe, North America and Australia.
Finally, the researchers have analyzed urban shadowing and its impact on driving range. They found that shadowing reduces the driving range by 18% and 60% (median values), for driving and parked vehicles, respectively.
“This higher shadowing impact for vehicles parked during the day suggests that the most interesting short-term potential market for VIPV is for vehicles that drive during the day, such as service vehicles, bus transport and other public transport modes such as car-sharing, ride-hailing or taxiing services,” the researchers write.
Moreover, they underline that it is expected that, whenever possible, solar-powered vehicles should choose open-area parking spaces with favorable irradiance conditions, reducing the effect of the significant shadows considered in their model.
Their results are discussed in “Effect of urban shadowing on the potential of solar-powered vehicles,” published in Progress in Photovoltaics.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/18/cyprus-operating-first-nanogrid-project/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CYPRUS",ILIAS TSAGAS,"SEPTEMBER 18, 2023",Cyprus starts first nanogrid project,"Nanogrids are smaller-scale energy systems than larger microgrids, says George Georghiou, the director of the FOSS Research Centre for Sustainable Energy at the University of Cyprus. He notes that nanogrids and microgrids share the same operational modes and provision of services. However, the significantly smaller size of nanogrids in terms of power capacity results in quicker and more cost-effective deployment. The smaller size of nanogrids also opens up opportunities for aggregation and the implementation of new business models.
With this in mind, the FOSS Research Centre – in cooperation with Ecotricity Holdings, a local energy developing firm – has built the first hybrid nanogrid system  in Cyprus on the campus of the University of Cyprus. The project features a 40 kWp building.integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system, combined with 66 kWh (60 kW) of energy storage capacity, a 21 kW EV charging station, and an energy management system.
The owner of the nanogrid is the University of Cyprus. The project was mainly financed by the European Union. Ecotricity Holdings was selected by the University of Cyprus via a tender.
An Ecotricity Holdings spokesperson told pv magazine that a key feature of the pilot is the seamless transition from a grid-connected mode to an islanding mode of operation. The developer says that this is the first time that an islanded system has been put into operation in Cyprus. The battery inverter is equipped with grid-forming capabilities and can ensure that critical loads are supplied with power without interruption (power from batteries and PV system) in case of a contingency or external signal triggering.
“The main benefits of nanogrids for Cypriot consumers is to provide cheaper and cleaner electricity from renewables, and improved self-consumption from renewable technologies such as solar,” says Georghiou.
He adds that nanogrids offer several other potential benefits.
“Nanogrids can provide balancing services in grid-connected mode of operation since exchange of energy can be bidirectional,” says Georghiou. “In more detail, nanogrids can provide active and reactive power support, supplemental reserve and backup supply in open competitive market, while they can easily sell power for system black start.”
Georghiou’s remarks underscore why the University of Cyprus pilot project matters for the research community , the PV sector, and smart energy technologies. Nevertheless, its practical applicability in Cyprus is currently limited. The country has only partially liberalized its electricity sector in recent years, primarily for industrial users.
Competition remains absent in the residential market, and there is no ancillary market. Despite government statements promising full liberalization and competitiveness in the electricity market next year, such assertions have been made for several years, leading to skepticism about the government's intentions.
Georghiou says the transition of the Cypriot electricity market has sparked interest from both the distribution system operator and the Electricity Authority of Cyprus (EAC). They are eager to explore and comprehend new grid services, including frequency regulation, voltage support, black start, and ramp rate control. The center's researchers are currently closely collaborating with the EAC to showcase these new ancillary services within the nanogrid framework and to incorporate emerging technologies like vehicle-to-grid and green hydrogen.
The University of Cyprus intends to convert its pilot project into an accessible “living lab” for policymakers, regulators, and the Cyprus grid operator to implement novel concepts through collaboration with university researchers.
In addition to providing ancillary market services, Georghiou says nanogrids offer business opportunities for financial firms. These opportunities could arise from aggregating portfolios of nanogrids, allowing financial firms to introduce energy-as-a-service and other innovative financing models.
“That is due to the possibility of optimizing energy use, storing excess energy production and monetizing grid support,” says Georghiou. “Finally, nanogrids can also provide resilience from extreme weather events and man-made events (cyberattacks).”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/18/researchers-claim-pv-near-railway-tracks-is-technically-feasible/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,PAKISTAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 18, 2023",Researchers claim PV near railway tracks is technically feasible,"An international team has conducted a technical and economic analysis to assess if deploying PV systems between or close to railway tracks is a viable option for rural applications and has found that this heavily criticized project typology may not only be technically feasible but also commercially attractive.
The main criticisms made of this approach relate, in particular, to two primary issues that may affect the performance of the solar panels – hard soiling and strong mechanical stress caused by the passage of the trains above the modules – two factors that could significantly reduce the system's lifecycle and performance.
The scientists were aware of these risks and said that in Bangladesh, however, rail tracks are commonly built on soft alluvial soils that generally attenuate the vibration amplitude created by passing rolling stocks.
The scientists investigated, in particular, the feasibility of a net-meter-supported mini-grid solar photovoltaic power plant located near the nearside of the railway track in Bangladesh. They assumed a 128 kW array to be deployed alongside the rail track in the Bonomala region of Tongi in Gazipur, Bangladesh, with the distance between the rail track and the panel-bearing racking system pole being 3–4 meters.
The surrounding area has potential loads such as an 18.4 kW deep-tube well, two 5 kW shallow machines, a 35 KVA-driven poultry farm, and a 50 KVA-driven dairy farm. “Furthermore, a village market is surrounded by over a hundred families,” the researchers stated. “So, more than 100 kW of load demand exists.”
For the modeling, which considered solar panels, inverters, meters, wires, power requirement, output power, performance ratio estimation, meteorological data for the selected area, and tilt angle optimization, the scientists used the PVsyst software.
“The 128 kW power plant requires 342 solar panels racking on two or three rows of mounting systems alongside the railway track; thus, a total of 623 m2 of state-owned railway land is required that would be utilized both for transportation as well as renewable power generation,” they explained. “Furthermore, as the dimensions of the module are 1,755 mm x 1,038 mm x 35 mm, a 1.821 m2 area is required for racking every single module.”
For the PV system, the group assumed a tilt angle of 20.8 decrease, a module output of 375 W, three 33 kW string inverters, and a southern orientation. Their analysis also took into account a 1% array soiling loss, a 2% module mismatch loss, a 1% light-induced degradation loss, and other loss fractions such as string mismatch loss, module degradation loss, and DC wiring loss. Capex was estimated at $124,688 and opex for annual O&M activities was estimated at $4,748.
The scientists found that the system has a performance ratio (PR) of 77.3% and a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of $0.052. They also found that its net present value (NPV) and payback time are $196,894 and 8.4 years, respectively. “Putting in place PV power plants next to the railway track might, all things considered, be a game-changing solution for Bangladesh's rural areas, supplying reliable, affordable, and clean power to boost employment prospects, raise living standards, and lessen the effects of climate change,” they concluded.
Their findings can be found in the study “Techno-economic study of a photovoltaic power plant besides the railway track for rural uses in Bangladesh,” published in e-Prime – Advances in Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Energy. The research group comprises academics from the University of Dhaka in Bangladesh and the Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (BCSIR), as well as from the RMIT University in Australia and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).

Here, we examine home batteries, how well they perform over time, and how long they last.
Residential energy storage has become an increasingly popular feature of home solar. A recent SunPower survey of more than 1,500 households found that about 40% of Americans worry about power outages on a regular basis. Of the survey respondents actively considering solar for their homes, 70% said they planned to include a battery energy storage system.
Besides providing backup power during outages, many batteries are integrated with technology that allows for intelligent scheduling of the import and export of energy. The goal is to maximize the value of the home’s solar system. And, some batteries are optimized to integrate an electric vehicle charger.
The report noted a steep uptick to consumers showing interest in storage in order to self-supply solar generation, suggesting that lowered net metering rates are discouraging export of local, clean electricity. Nearly 40% of consumers reported self-supply as a reason for getting a storage quote, up from less than 20% in 2022. Backup power for outages and savings on utility rates were also listed as top reasons for including energy storage in a quote.
Attachment rates of batteries in residential solar projects have climbed steadily in 2020 8.1% of residential solar systems attached batteries, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and in 2022 that rate climbed over 17%.
Warranty periods can offer a look in installer and manufacturer expectations of the life of a battery. Common warranty periods are typically around 10 years. The warranty for the Enphase IQ Battery, for instance, ends at 10 years or 7,300 cycles, whatever occurs first.
Solar installer Sunrun said batteries can last anywhere between five to 15 years. That means a replacement likely will be needed during the 20 to 30 year life of a solar system.
Battery life expectancy is mostly driven by usage cycles. As demonstrated by the LG and Tesla product warranties, thresholds of 60% or 70% capacity are warranted through a certain number of charge cycles.
Two use-scenarios drive this degradation: over charge and trickle charge, said the Faraday Institute. Overcharge is the act of pushing current into a battery that is fully charged. Doing this can cause it to overheat, or even potentially catch fire.
Trickle charge involves a process in which the battery is continually charged up to 100%, and inevitably losses take place. The bounce between 100% and just under 100% can elevate internal temperatures, diminishing capacity and lifetime.
Another cause of degradation over time is the loss of mobile lithium-ions in the battery, said Faraday. Side reactions in the battery can trap free usable lithium, thereby lowering capacity gradually.
While cold temperatures can halt a lithium-ion battery from performing, they do not actually degrade the battery or shorten its effective life. Overall battery lifetime is, however, diminished at high temperatures, said Faraday. This is because the electrolyte that sits between the electrodes breaks down at elevated temperatures, causing the battery to lose its capacity for Li-ion shuttling. This can reduce the number of Li-ions the electrode can accept into its structure, depleting the lithium-ion battery capacity.
It is recommended by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to install a battery in a cool, dry place, preferably a garage, where the impact of a fire (a small, but non-zero threat) may be minimized. Batteries and components around them should have proper spacing to allow cooling, and regular maintenance check-ups can be helpful in ensuring optimal operation.
NREL said that whenever possible, avoid repeated deep discharging of batteries, as the more it is discharged, the shorter the lifetime. If the home battery is discharged deeply every day, it may be time to increase the battery bank’s size.
Batteries in series should be kept at the same charge, said NREL. Though the entire battery bank may display an overall charge of 24 volts, there can be varied voltage among the batteries, which is less beneficial to protecting the entire system over the long run. Additionally, NREL recommended that the correct voltage set points are set for chargers and charge controllers, as determined by the manufacturer.
Inspections should occur frequently, too, said NREL. Some things to look for include leakage (buildup on the outside of the battery), appropriate fluid levels, and equal voltage. NREL said each battery manufacturer may have additional recommendations, so checking maintenance and data sheets on a battery is a best practice.
