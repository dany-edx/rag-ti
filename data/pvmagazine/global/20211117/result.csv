The announcement, made by the European Commission, revealed that seven projects with total capital costs above €7.5 million were selected for funding under the first Innovation Fund call for large-scale projects.
“The innovative bifacial heterojunction technology ensures higher performance with respect to conventional modules, thanks to the intrinsic characteristics of the advanced bifacial structure that allows for the maximization of energy production while minimizing the cost of electricity (LCOE) in utility-scale installations,” said the Commission in a statement. “Furthermore, the project aims at enabling the application of the Tandem structure to B–HJT solar cells, in order to  overcome the limit imposed by silicon bound to its bandgap.”
Brussels stressed that Enel's project is aimed at sustaining European technology leadership in next-generation PV modules and cells and that it will have a positive impact on the whole PV value chain.
Enel has not released yet a comment on the matter.
The company started production at the 200 MW facility in October 2019. It invested around €80 million in reviving the factory, which was built in 2011 with Japanese electronics manufacturer Sharp and French-Italian semiconductor business STMicroelectronics. Enel took full control of the facility in July 2014. At the time, the factory was intended to produce multi-junction, thin film silicon PV modules.
The resumption of production was part-financed by the European research and innovation program Horizon 2020 with the Italian Ministry of Economic Development, the Sicilian regional government, and incentives for Smart Factory 4.0 development.

The mobile storage solution was connected to a section of the PV plant that had already reached completion and was used to replace diesel power generators.
The solar park in Skurup will be operational shortly and Alight's experts are currently collecting and evaluating data from the trial with the battery. “A long-term scenario we have is that when the first part of the park is built and operational, we can use that power to charge the batteries then used to build the rest of the park,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “Our rough estimate is that it wouldn't need more than approximately 500 kW and then can be expanded to around 1 MW.”
“As we have seen in our pilot project, Northvolt’s battery capabilities can enable us to remove diesel generators from our site, and we hope to expand further utilizing this option, aiming for a diesel-free solar plant construction,” said Alight CEO, Harald Överholm.
The Voltpack Mobile System delivers up to 250 kW with a scalable capacity from 245 to 1225 kWh of available energy. The system scales through a central interface hub, which can connect up to five self-contained Voltpacks in parallel, each containing three liquid-cooled, industrial-grade battery Voltpack Cores. Swedish utility Vattenfall is also testing the system at its facility in Alvkarleby.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/17/iberdrola-announces-winners-of-agrivoltaic-contest/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 17, 2021",Iberdrola announces winners of agrivoltaic contest,"Spain-based energy company Iberdrola has selected four projects through the contest it launched in May to identify competitive and innovative solutions to combine solar PV plants with activities related to agriculture, horticulture, livestock, fish-farming, or bee-keeping. The company said it received 110 proposals from 32 countries.
Only one of the four selected projects is not specifically relying on PV as an electricity source –that of French company Itk – which will provide its FarmLife cow behavior monitoring and analysis platform for improving a farm's performance and resilience. The other three projects are all schemes related to the combination of agricultural activities with solar power generation.
One of them will be developed by Spanish renewable energy company EcoEnergías del Guadiana, which aims to set up tomato cultivation under a PV system built on fixed or retractable structures. These should protect the crops during heat waves, save water, and improve harvest yields.
The second project will be developed by Italian software provider Techedge, Spanish tracker manufacturer PVH, and Gonzalez Byass, which is one of Spain's most well-known sherry bodegas. “The Winesolar solution will develop a photovoltaic system with an intelligent tracker adapted to generate shadow and protect vineyards,” said Iberdrola. “Additionally, an artificial intelligent algorithm will control those trackers to adapt them to the physiological needs of the vineyards, and in parallel optimize PV production.”
The third project was proposed by French startup Ombrea, which has developed a solar-blind technology with sliding PV panels. “The remote solution, based on solar panels, spreads out and retracts in order to modulate light and shadow according to data collected on-site via sensors,” Iberdrola said. “The aim is to protect plants from extreme heat, drought, hail and frost.”
The contest's winner will be financially backed by the Spanish utility to develop and build their projects. In addition, Iberdrola will provide technical support to test the proposed solutions, by giving them access to equipment, teams, infrastructures, high-tech sites, and co-working areas.

While HJT modules are already in production from a few manufacturers, there is plenty of potential to push their efficiency higher.
Chinese manufacturer Longi Solar earlier this year set a record for HJT cell efficiency at 26.3%, and Australian startup SunDrive pushed efficiency for a commercial-sized to 25.54% back in September. Cell efficiencies for most HJT cells in mass production, however, remain around the 23-24% mark.
Scientists led by Germany’s Forschungszentrum Jülich analyzed the mechanisms leading to performance losses in an HJT cell, and identified several potential new routes to improved efficiency. And they were able to demonstrate these routes in action, improving the efficiency of an M2-sized HJT cell from 23.55% to 24.51% through the use of a two-layer structure of amorphous silicon and the addition of magnesium fluoride as an anti-reflective coating. Their work is described in full in the paper A route towards high-efficiency silicon heterojunction solar cells, published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
The group noted that losses in the cell current were primarily caused by reflection, light trapping and parasitic absorption, while transport between the silicon layers and the transparent electrode was the source of losses in fill factor. Many common strategies to reduce parasitic absorption, they note, are in contradiction with efforts to reduce the series resistance.
In looking for ways to avoid this contradiction, the group focused on the rear side of the cell. They divided the amorphous silicon layer into two parts, with a porous first layer and a dense second layer. This was shown to reduce resistance losses between the layers on the rear side, and improve the cell’s fill factor. Secondly, they applied a layer of magnesium fluoride between the transparent conductive oxide and back reflector, which reduced absorption and improved the current in the cell.
In their analysis of the loss mechanisms, the group also identified several other possible routes to improvement, with possibilities including more transparent, wide bandgap window layers, or further optimizations to the transparent conductive oxide layer, taking into account both optical and electrical effects.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/17/european-consortium-develops-pilot-line-for-complete-pv-module-recycling/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 17, 2021",European consortium develops pilot line for complete PV module recycling,"Italian research agency Enea and Italy-based heterojunction PV manufacturer Enel Green Power are contributing to the development of a pilot line to completely recycle solar modules at the end of their life cycle.
The novel recycling process is being developed the frame of the research project Photorama, which is coordinated by the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), and is aimed at demonstrating innovative solutions dedicated to the recycling of raw materials from end-of-life PV products while maximizing the recovery rates of raw materials from PV panels compared to conventional technologies and enabling the use of the recycled materials with a circular economy approach for the production of secondary raw materials (SRMs).
The project envisages the construction of a low-emissions pilot line to recover critical and precious metals such as silicon (Si), indium (In), gallium (Ga), silver (Ag). It will then reintroduce them into the production cycle as new materials or new products.
The pilot line will work in three different steps: module auto disassembly, the smart separation of the components, and the innovative recovery of the materials.
“The process starts with a new delamination technique based on a wire diamond technology, developed and patented by the CEA,” Enea researcher Massimo Izzi told pv magazine. “With this technology, it will be possible to separate a module’s glass, backsheet, and cells in a single process, in such a way that the single parts of the module can then be treated individually for the recycling phase.”
Chemical-physical processes based on supercritical fluid (SCF) is another delamination process that will be developed to allow for further high recovery rate material without resorting to the current and inefficient shredding techniques through which the cells, which are the valuable part of the module, end up in a recovery chain of low economic value, the so-called “down-cycling.”
The wire diamond and the SFC techs are used after the recovery of external aluminum, cable and junction box is implemented, enabling the clean separation of glass, solar cells and polymers and providing uncontaminated materials fractions. After the smart separation phase, an innovative extraction process is used to recover a silver fraction of more than 95% with a high purity level from the solar cell. Moreover, the remaining fraction of silicon will be recovered at metallurgic grade.
A subdivision of the pilot line will be dedicated to the recycling of thin-film GIGS modules. The delamination and extraction processes will be based on technologies patented by German technology company Lux Chemtech and will allow high recovery of indium and gallium. The process using biodegradable leachate in CIGS panels will also be developed for the heterojunction technology in which silicon and indium are electrochemically isolated after dissolution.
After the entire recycling process is finished, the unbroken glass will be remastered for direct use in the solar industry, while silver will be converted into conductive inks for screen printing or electrically conductive adhesives to be tested and qualified in PV factories. Silicon will be treated to obtain different purities for use as silicon feedstock in PV manufacturing, or as a sputtering target. Indium will be used in thin-film deposition to be tested and qualified in PV manufacturing. Gallium will be processed to fabricate Cu-Ga or Cu-In-Ga targets used in CIGS-CIS thin-film PV manufacturing.
The pilot line is expected to reach a technology readiness level (TRL) of seven. The TRL measures the maturity of technology components for a system and is based on a scale from one to nine, with nine representing mature technologies for full commercial application. According to Izzi, the pilot line will allow the recovery of the metals from the panels with a degree of purity that has never been achieved before. “It is one of the more advanced and efficient recycling processes in the world,” he said.
The development of the new recycling process will be done in conjunction with testing in a real factory environment. Enel Green Power will provide the modules to be recycled and will use the recycled raw materials in solar cell and module production.
The consortium also includes Spanish PV equipment supplier Mondragon Assembly, Norwegian research entity Sintef, Belgian flat glass processor Maltha, Spanish research company Idener, and Lux Chemtech.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/17/us-court-throws-out-trump-trade-action-on-bifacial-modules/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"NOVEMBER 17, 2021",US court throws out Trump trade action on bifacial modules,"From pv magazine USA
The U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) issued a decision that reinstates an exclusion of bifacial solar modules from Section 201 tariffs. The exclusion originally was extended in 2019, but later was revoked by the Trump Administration in an October 2020 proclamation.
The court found that while the Trump’s proclamation complied with procedural requirements of the safeguard statute, the action was outside of the president’s delegated authority. In its 32-page decision, the court prohibited further enforcement of the proclamation, which was numbered 10101. The court order effectively reinstated an earlier exemption from tariffs for bifacial modules. In addition, the court decision reduced the Section 201 tariff rate from 18% to 15% after it was raised as part of Proclamation 10101. Both actions will result in refunds of the tariffs that had been collected under the proclamation.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) called the decision a win for the solar industry. Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA president and CEO, said the decision to strike down the presidential proclamation “was clearly the right conclusion.” She said the proclamation’s actions amounted to an unlawful attempt to harshen the Section 201 tariffs.”
The Trump administration’s main argument was that bifacial modules were likely to account for a greater share of the market in the future and could substitute for monofacial products in a range of market segments. It continued that exempting imports of bifacial modules from the safeguard tariff would apply “significant downward pressure” on prices of domestically produced modules.
At the time, Trump also cited the impact of bifacial’s growing share of the U.S. market as his reason for putting a hold on the fourth year stepdown of the solar tariffs from 20% to 15%. He opted, instead, to reset the rate for all imported solar panels at 18%. When first imposed in 2018 as part of Trump’s trade war with China, the tariffs were set at 30%, to be decreased 5% each year for four years.
In February, 17 U.S. clean energy CEOs  urged President Joe Biden to repeal the solar tariff proclamation, which the leaders called “punitive” and “ill conceived.” In a letter to Biden, the CEOs said that the proclamation increased the 2021 trade tariff rate for imported solar cells and modules and argued that the decision “arbitrarily” revoked the exclusion for bifacial solar panels.
Led by SEIA and supported by the American Clean Power Association, the letter called attention to the proclamation’s impact to existing solar contracts and discussed how harmful the Section 201 tariffs are to the U.S. economy and the industry’s ability to address climate change. The CEOs asked Biden to return the tariffs to status quo and restore business certainty.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/17/the-solar-facade-with-a-golden-glow/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWITZERLAND",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"NOVEMBER 17, 2021",The solar facade with a golden glow,"From pv magazine Germany
The new building of the Office for Environment and Energy of Basel, in Switzerland, is 25 m high and completely encased in a solar façade that extends over 1,140 m2. The façade has an installed capacity of 163 kW and the shimmering golden solar modules used for the project lend the building a unique look.
The idea dates back to 2013 when local architectural firm Jessenvolleweider won a competition with its design proposal. In 2016, a referendum enabled the construction of the sustainable building, which was officially opened at the beginning of November. The original project envisaged the use of solar modules comprised of golden solar cells; however, a different approach was eventually employed, which used a new solar module fabricated with a special fused glass from Megasol Energie AG.
“The ability of this glass to take on different appearances under different light situations was the basis for our research,” said Sven Kowalewsky from Jessenhlenweider. “And the free design options for fused glass were the decisive factor.” The solar modules are designed in such a way that they form the outer skin of the new building. Viewed from a distance, the façade takes on a golden sheen, which is created by thousands of points embedded in the solar modules. In addition, the modules have a three-dimensional appearance.
“We developed these solar modules in close cooperation with the architect,” said Megasol Energie's spokesperson, Michael Reist. The solar modules installed in the building are made with a rear side glass, an encapsulation layer, solar cells, another encapsulation layer, and the 3D front glass. Megasol then assembles the components into one unit in a laminator. “Each solar module was developed specifically for the project, which requires appropriate adjustments and readjustments during manufacturing,” Reist said.

An additional challenge in the production of the solar modules is that 3D fused glass has a three-dimensional structure on both the front and back. “Standard processes are designed for ‘flat’ glasses and cannot absorb such modifications, especially in the lamination,” he continued. “Lamination is a sensitive process and the smallest change in temperature, pressure, processing time or material properties lead to undesirable results.”
Megasol applied a process specifically adapted to 3D glasses with an appropriate lamination technique with regard to temperature, pressure, and processing time. This process is crucial for the quality, performance, and longevity of the solar modules.
In addition to its unique appearance, the solar façade in Basel has another advantage: According to Megasol, it also produces a lot of solar power in winter. This is due to the fact that solar façade surfaces are ideally suited to the low winter sun, as the light falls almost perpendicularly onto the solar cells. “Together with the cold air, which increases the efficiency of the cells, these are very good conditions,” said Reist.

India's Ministry of Power and New and Renewable Energy have issued revised guidelines for thermal generation companies to set up renewable energy generation capacity, either by themselves or through developers, via open bids. The companies will supply the bundled power to the consumers under existing power purchase agreements.
This will enable the replacement of high-cost fossil fuel based energy with cheaper renewable energy under existing PPAs. The gains from the bundling of renewable energy with thermal will be shared between the generator and distribution companies or other procurers on a 50:50 basis. As the renewable energy will be balanced with thermal energy, the distribution companies will need not acquire any separate capacity for balancing of renewable energy.
“This is a very significant step toward achieving the goal of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030. The distribution companies will be able to count the renewable energy supplied under the scheme towards their renewable purchase obligation and this will be without the financial burden of separate PPA. This step by the central government will lead to a faster energy transition and will be beneficial for both the generators and the distribution companies,” said the power ministry.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/17/fire-risks-for-rooftop-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",PV MAGAZINE,"NOVEMBER 17, 2021",Fire risks for rooftop solar,"From pv magazine USA
Whether you’re a homeowner looking to cut back on your electricity bill or a corporation seeking ways to reduce your carbon footprint, it’s likely that you have looked into or have already installed rooftop solar. And you wouldn’t be alone.
The global rooftop solar market size was valued at $62.4 billion in 2019 and is projected to progress at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.9%from 2020 to 2025, according to one recent report.
The benefits of rooftop solar are enormous. With PV prices low enough to compete with grid prices, impacts from climate change on the rise, the energy and carbon savings easily calculated, and your rooftop likely unused real estate, there has never been a better time to incorporate solar.
However, due to inconsistent installation practices, intense manufacturer competition, and sometimes-conflicting motives between operations and maintenance (O&M) providers and end-owners, the risk of fires on rooftop installations is uncomfortably common.
Based on a sample of hundreds of commercial scale rooftop inspections performed by Clean Energy Associates (CEA) globally, more than 90% of inspected rooftops had significant safety and fire risks.
One need only perform a simple Google search to find examples of these risks turning into actual fires and causing costly damage, business disruptions, store closures, data center interruptions, and so on. Thankfully, despite the prevalence of the risks, the causes, identification, and the remediation and resolution are surprisingly straightforward.
Common issues
Let’s start with the causes. The three most common gating issues (that is, issues that pose a potentially immediate fire risk) include:
Each of these issues pose potentially immediate fire risks. But many systems can operate fine for years without incident before causing a fire. Thankfully, these “ticking time bombs” can easily be identified by performing an in-depth system-off (de-energized) visual inspection, and typically are also easily fixed. So, how do these relatively trivial issues come about in the first place, and why are they so prevalent across the industry worldwide?
The answer to this question falls into three categories: inconsistent and widely varying installation practices, inaccurate or incomplete connector information, and conflicting motives between O&M providers and system-owners.
The first issue is fairly straightforward and self-explanatory. Typically, companies contract out the installation to one or more third-party installation groups. Commercial-grade rooftop solar is still a relatively new field with solar jobs outpacing the overall job growth rate in the United States by five times over the past decade. Incomplete or inconsistent training is understandably associated with this type of rapid industry expansion and is one of the leading causes of fire risks on commercial rooftops.
The second, and more significant, cause of these fire risks is incomplete and sometimes inaccurate information regarding solar module connectors.
In brief, rooftop solar modules are typically installed in strings of modules connected in series (usually between 18 to 20 modules for commercial/industrial systems) before they ultimately are connected to an inverter at the end. The distance from one module to the next on a string is standard. As a result, the module-to-module wire harness connections on the string are factory-made.
However, because the distance from the end of the string to the inverter varies, those connections (module to inverter and inverter to panel board) are typically “field-made” connectors that are assembled on site instead of in the factory.
There’s always a risk of an installer creating field-made connectors without realizing that they’re mismatched. But the larger industry issue contributing to improperly made connectors is the inconsistent and inaccurate information from manufacturers regarding which connectors are compatible with each other.If the field-made connections use different hardware than the module-to-module connectors on the string, or if they are not assembled and installed per the manufacturer’s specifications, then there a significant risk exists of a hotspot developing. This, in turn, may lead to a fire. Mismatched or improperly made connectors are a common cause of rooftop solar fires; in some cases they account for 100% of an installation’s connectors.
An important resource is the update to the National Electrical Code (NEC) on this issue, which states, “Where mating connectors are not of the identical type and brand, they shall be listed and identified for intermateability, as described in the manufacturer’s instructions.” However, without proper training, the problem of improper field-made connections is likely to persist.'
With the rise of connector manufacturers, companies may list their connector as “X-connector compatible” in their marketing literature but without the UL listing or documentation to support such a claim. This leads installers to think the mismatched connectors are compatible, when in fact they are not. In terms of seriousness, this is a global issue and the leading cause of fire risks found from our inspectors.
The third common cause of fire risks not being promptly identified and resolved is the complicated nature of agreements between an O&M company and a system end-owner. As these agreements typically are written, an O&M is required to fix known issues as well as perform yearly or bi-annual inspections. Here, too, the inspectors sent to conduct these inspections may have widely varying experience.
More importantly, however, they may be disincentivized to spend much amount of time looking for issues they would ultimately be liable to resolve.
Rather than performing a relatively time-intensive row-by-row inspection that could easily identify issues such as wires on sharp edges, heavy scoring, and mismatched connectors, O&M inspectors may instead opt to run system performance tests and only inspect a sample of the modules.
Understanding risk
Understanding how we got to this point is important. But site owners need to understand how they can check their current installations for fire risks and resolve them as quickly as possible. The good news is that the identification and resolution of these issues is a relatively simple one.
Step 1: De-energize a site:  With a group of licensed professionals, follow proper de-energization procedures and ensure the system is in a safe system-off state.
Step 2: Perform an in-depth visual inspection and system-off tests: Due to the seriousness and prevalence of these fire risks, qualified inspectors are recommended to perform an in-depth (system off) visual inspection. This inspection should examine things like mismatched or improperly made connectors, wires resting on or hanging near sharp edges, poor terminations at inverters, and heavy wire scoring or improperly landed and torqued terminations
The system-off test should also include DC Insulation Resistance Test (DC IRT) to check the current leakage on the AC cables, and a continuity test to ensure proper component grounding.
Step 3: Perform system-on inspections: After resolving the safety issues found during the visual inspection and system-off tests and eliminating the safety risks posed by those, re-energize the site and perform system-on thermal imaging of the components (inverters, field made connectors, factory-made connectors, load centers, combiner boxes, central and string inverters, and so on).
In all thermal scans, look for a change in temperature (ΔT), with a large enough variance from a determined average temperature of other identical components onsite. Lastly, confirm that the inverters are running properly without irregularities or faulting, and the monitoring capabilities are hooked up and running properly.
According to a Yale University study, about 70% percent of commercial buildings in the United States – or 600,000 sites – are potential targets for solar projects. At best, only a few tens of thousands of those commercial rooftops are currently equipped with solar. With rising demand and the expected growth of the rooftop solar industry, the issue of fire and other safety risks is likely to only get worse without remediation, so it is imperative to ensure that your system is installed properly and not operating with risks.

Finding and resolving safety risks on your rooftop solar installations is straight-forward, and performing the due-diligence up-front can save significant costs (both real and reputational). If your site has been energized for more than five years, then there is an increased threat that these issues are present. Relying on the trained eye from a certified installer is the best way to check your rooftop for fire risks.
Check that you are using an installer with a good track-record and put the due diligence into your O&M contract up front to ensure regular and proper maintenance and inspections. Bringing in a third party to validate the results of your O&M inspectors or provide an unbiased extra level of scrutiny can help ensure that safety risks are found and that a remediation plan is drawn up to resolve them.
