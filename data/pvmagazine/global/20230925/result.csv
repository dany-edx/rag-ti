Solarvest Holdings Berhad is a key partner of the Solar Citra Project, with M K Land Holdings Berhad owning and developing the plant.
Moritz Sticher, a senior adviser for Berlin-based consulting firm Apricum, said that the project – commissioned under Malaysia’s Large-Scale Solar (LSS) Procurement Scheme – is significant, even though it is “rather small.”
“In terms of impact towards Malaysia’s new [renewables] target of 70% by the end of 2050, it is rather small, but every project is important,” Sticher said in an email. “It is good to see another solar project commissioned, [but it is] not huge though compared to a currently installed solar capacity of around 1.94 GW in Malaysia.”
Stitcher said he expects more financially challenged projects in the fourth round of the LSS4 scheme to become feasible as module prices decline.
“More commissioning of other pending projects [is] expected,” he said.
The LSS, introduced in 2016, is a competitive bidding program that is designed to decrease the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for the development of large-scale solar PV plants in Malaysia.
GoodWe said in the announcement the array was the first large-scale project to feature its “one-stop PV solution.” This includes 52 units of 250 kW Ht string inverters, two 6,750 kVA medium-voltage stations, an SCB3000 communication device and the SolarOS monitoring platform. The project is expected to generate 24.095 GWh of electricity per annum.
In August 2022, the Malaysian Energy Commission said it would extend power purchase agreements (PPAs) from the fourth LSS4 tenders from 21 to 25 years, which is expected to ensure the deliverability of projects.
The LSS4 program allocated 823.06 MW of capacity among 30 projects. Out of a total allocation of 2,457 MW, only 1,160 MW had become operational by the second quarter of 2022. The forthcoming round, LSS5, is anticipated to commence by the end of this year, with the government currently assessing the potential inclusion of virtual PPAs.

French agrivoltaics specialist TSE has built a 2.9 MW agrivoltaic power plant equipped with an irrigation system intended to improve water management on large crops.
The system, deployed over 3 hectares in Brouchy, Hauts-de-France, is expected to deliver water savings of nearly 30%. Sensors placed on the canopy enable the system to optimize irrigation by watering only when required and providing the appropriate amount of water.
It is equipped with trackers that can rotate the solar panels, positioned at a height of 5 meters, from east to west. This equipment generates partial and rotating shading on the plot throughout the day, effectively mitigating thermal and water stress, as reported by TSE.
“On the plot, the plants have particularly suffered from thermal and water stress in recent years, with strong thermal amplitudes and especially long periods without water which have impacted plant growth and yields, particularly in wheat and potatoes,” said Benoît Bougler, the farmer at the site. “I was looking for solutions to adapt to climate change and irrigated agrivoltaics is one of the possible answers.”
France's National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food, and the Environment (INRAE) will collaborate with Bougler and TSE to conduct agronomic trials on various crops, including soybeans, wheat, fodder rye, winter barley, and rapeseed, over a period of nine years. These trials will involve comparing the results with those obtained from a reference parcel that lacks the PV installation.
The local Chamber of Agriculture will also assess the agrivoltaic facility and its irrigation system's impact on water resources. For non-irrigated crops, the trial will focus on the shading effects generated by the agricultural canopy, addressing water stress and reduced evapotranspiration. In the case of irrigated crops, the trial will explore potential irrigation savings facilitated by the PV system and intelligent irrigation.
The PV plant operates under a 20-year PPA to supply electricity for the factories of a local company, bioMérieux.

Honeywell and ESS are collaborating on advancing development of iron flow battery (IFB) energy storage systems based on ESS’ patented IFB design with Honeywell’s advanced materials and energy systems expertise.
The Honeywell Company dates back to 1885 with an invention that was a precursor to today’s thermostat. Fast forward many decades, acquisitions and spinoffs later, and one of the company’s many areas of expertise is in utility-scale battery energy storage systems. In 2021 the company developed flow battery technology intended for pairing with wind and solar resources and partnered with Duke Energy to field test the long-duration energy storage (LDES) product.
ESS, founded in 2011, manufactures iron flow batteries using widely available, Earth-abundant materials. Designed for applications that require up to twelve hours of flexible energy capacity, the batteries are used in utility-scale renewable energy installations, remote solar-plus-storage microgrids, solar load-shifting and peak shaving, as well as other ancillary grid services.
At a recent ceremony at RE+ 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce awarded ESS an Export Achievement Certificate for expanding global deployment of its American-made, innovative long-duration energy storage technology. In response to domestic and global demand, the company announced that it will boost its manufacturing capacity at its Wilsonville, Oregon facility up to 2 GWh annually. 
“The demand for long-duration energy storage represents a compelling market opportunity within the energy transition and the combination of Honeywell and ESS technology can accelerate decarbonization for the commercial, industrial and utility sectors,” said Bryan Glover, chief growth officer, Honeywell Performance Materials and Technology (PMT) group. “Our strategic collaboration with ESS will accelerate Honeywell’s ability to bring comprehensive solutions to our customers while working to  advance long-duration energy storage across all industries requiring expansive energy storage.”
The collaboration between Honeywell and ESS enables Honeywell to integrate ESS technology into its global offering, and ESS gains license to Honeywell’s flow battery intellectual property. Additionally, the two plan to work together on continual technology advancement, cost reduction and packaging of IFB systems.
ESS battery systems have a prescribed design life of 25 years, the battery modules, electrolyte, plumbing, and other components may well last for decades longer with proper maintenance. The battery, for example, is expected to experience zero degradation over 20,000 cycles. Read more about its duration here.
Honeywell has invested $27.5 million into ESS common stock; purchasing 16.5 million shares at $1.67 per share. Honeywell also received a warrant to purchase an additional 10.6 million shares for $20 million at $1.89 per share. Honeywell also announced its intention to purchase up to $300 million of ESS products, with $15 million prepaid.
In addition to the investment, ESS receives exclusive license of Honeywell IP related to flow batteries
“Today, we are creating superior technology in the critical long-duration energy storage industry,” said  Eric Dresselhuys, CEO of ESS. “Combining ESS’ innovative technology and deployment experience with  Honeywell’s storage and control system expertise will enable us to drive the clean energy transition and  deliver value to our customers, shareholders and communities.”
Honeywell and ESS are teaming up at a time of huge growth in long-duration energy storage. According to the Department of Energy’s ‘Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Long Duration Energy Storage’ report, the U.S. grid needs 225 to 460 GW of LDES capacity for power market application for a net zero economy by 2060.  The global LDES market is estimated to be $50 billion per year and forecast to grow significantly with a cumulative investment of up to $3 trillion by 2040, according to the LDES Council and McKinsey & Co.
As the shift to renewable energy accelerates, challenges associated with the intermittency of renewables are becoming more apparent. The solution is to embrace safe and sustainable long-duration energy storage technologies, which can address the intermittency of renewables by ensuring stored energy is available to balance fluctuations in electricity demand and supply.
“Long-duration energy storage is critical to meet local, regional and global net-zero decarbonization goals,” Julia Souder, chief executive officer of the Long Duration Energy Storage Council, told pv magazine USA. “LDES complements rapid renewable growth by offering flexibility, reliability, affordability and security. This partnership allows us to work together to accelerate the various markets and contracts even faster to deploy diverse LDES technologies.”
ESS held a webcast conference call on Monday, September 25, 2023 to discuss the partnership with Honeywell and it will be available on ESS’ Investor  Relations website.

“A significant number of the mini-grids deployed in off-grid areas of developing countries are experiencing serious reliability issues,” the academic explained in the paper “Long-term optimal capacity expansion planning for an operating off-grid PV mini-grid in rural Africa under different demand evolution scenarios,” which was recently published in Energy for Sustainable Development.
“At the root of the capacity shortage problem lies inaccurate initial demand assessments, and subsequent under-sizing of the mini-grids. Many mini-grids are designed using static and artificial load profiles, assuming that the present consumption levels of customers reflect their future energy needs.”
The researchers investigated the case study of a mini-grid operating in a small town called Omorate, located in southern Ethiopia. Costumers of this mini-grid in 2022 had a demand of 638.8 MWh, of which 250 MWh, or 40%, was unmet.
This system has a capacity of 375 kW and consists of a PV system, converters, maximum power point trackers (MPPTs), a storage system using five LiFePO4 battery packs with a total nominal storage capacity of 600 kWh, a diesel generator with 100 kW power, a distribution board and loads.
Using the HOMER Pro optimization software, they assumed three expansion scenarios for the mini-grid. In all scenarios, a maximum of 10% yearly shortage was allowed.
In the first scenario, the system expansion was conceived to meet the current demands – estimated to be on average 1750 kWh/day and 639 MWh/year. The second scenario assumed a 5 % annual demand growth rate, resulting in a daily and annual demand of 3,039 kWh and 1,109 MWh, respectively. The third scenario assumed a 15% annual demand growth rate for business and productive users only, summing up to daily and annual demand of 4,075 kWh and 1,487 MWh, respectively.
Through their analysis, the scientists found the third scenario had the lowest levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), of $0.404/kWh. The first scenario resulted in an LCOE of $0.887/kWh, and the second was $0.592/kWh. However, the average electricity price currently paid by households in the area was $0.030/kWh, meaning that the revenues generated from power sales may not be able to recover the cost of the expansion.

“The findings highlight two important points,” the paper says. “First, the financial viability of mini-grid capacity expansion heavily depends on the electricity prices. Second, ensuring the financial viability of off-grid mini-grids in Ethiopia requires designing the systems to support productive use of electricity and introducing appropriate incentive mechanisms and tariff restructuring.”
The researchers explained in the paper that the 15% expanding scenario will be the most expensive to complete, with a total cost of $7.4 million. The 5% expansion will cost $5.9 million, and the meet-the-demand scenario will cost $4.2 million.
Their findings also show that in all scenarios, the battery expansion accounts for most of the total capacity expansion costs, accounting for 52%, 62% and 73%, respectively.
“It is always recommended to use larger capacity batteries to meet a given electrical load. However, a larger battery also increases system costs, the researchers said. “Conversely, expanding the mini-grid solely based on cost minimization may not produce the desired reliability. This highlights the significant non-linear trade-off between minimizing capacity expansion costs and maximizing reliability levels.”
“Although not all, many of the findings of the study have a high degree of generalizability to the context in tropical east Africa and other developing regions at large,” the paper concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/25/solar-module-price-falling-with-no-end-in-sight/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 25, 2023","Solar module price falling, with no end in sight","We have all been asking ourselves for some time now: How far can photovoltaic module prices go down before the bottom is finally reached? Apparently, there is still room for further drops, as all prices have fallen again this month.
On average, prices in all module categories have been corrected downwards by around 10%. Never before in the history of photovoltaics have panel prices plummeted so significantly in such a short space of time. For a month or two now, the values have been below the previous all-time low of 2020 and even more so below the production costs of most manufacturers. Generating profit margins seems to be a thing of the past for the time being and for many of them it is now just a matter of minimizing damage or even survival.
How could we come to this, and what are the causes of this self-destructive trend?
First of all, it must be noted that module prices rose by more than 50% between October 2020 and October 2022, which is not due to technological developments, but primarily due to the pandemic-related supply shortage coupled with a simultaneous increase in demand. Ultimately, many players in the photovoltaic market made very good money – at the expense of the end consumers. Until recently, photovoltaic system prices were higher than they had been for a long time. Now things have completely changed, which inevitably leads to a drop in prices. The speed and intensity of this change, however, surprise even experienced market participants.
After the shortage issues of the past two years, many installers and wholesalers made generous forecasts and ordered new goods as if there was no tomorrow. The producers, predominantly from Asia, reacted and increased their capacities. Global production capacity usually exceeds the actual expected demand by 30% to 50%, so that fluctuations can be quickly compensated for. The production lines are then ramped up or down as needed. Recently, however, this mechanism has gotten a bit out of hand as many manufacturers have had to switch their cell and module production very quickly from p-type PERC technology to n-type TOPCon, due to patent rights problems in individual regions. However, since the sales restrictions did not apply worldwide, new capacities were built up for TOPCon without replacing the old capacities and without consistently shutting them down.
The prospects appeared to be good in the long term thanks to the supposedly permanently high costs of conventional energy sources. Unfortunately, European politicians were very good at replacing old fossil fuel sources with new ones at short notice, so the suffering from skyrocketing energy costs quickly fell. The pandemic also seems to have finally been overcome and the average European can travel without restrictions again. Not least due to high inflation, many people who recently wanted to invest in photovoltaic systems are now becoming more reluctant. The fact that interest rates on loans continue to rise doesn't make the decision any easier. The consequence of all the factors listed is a collapse in demand so that the photovoltaics industry has not yet emerged from the summer slump even in mid-September.
The quickly dwindling interest in solar power generation inevitably means that the order books of installers and project planners run empty and pre-ordered modules and inverters cannot be delivered on time. The goods are increasingly piling up at wholesalers and in the manufacturers' warehouses. There are now said to be 40 GW to 100 GW of unsold modules in European stores, primarily in the Rotterdam area. Determining an exact amount is almost impossible. However, it is enough to know that there is already about a year's supply of modules in Europe to understand the dimensions and scope of the matter. Storing these goods costs a lot of space and therefore money; losses are increasing day by day, while sales opportunities are decreasing. The pressure increases until the avalanche finally starts to slide and the first ones will begin offering their modules below purchasing or production costs. Competitors are forced to follow suit and the downward spiral is set in motion.
Now one might think that falling prices would have to increase demand. In many cases, the current price level for materials has not yet reached end customers or investors. For many providers, the old inventory, which was purchased at higher prices, is still too large. The wave of devaluation is also just beginning, which is why the price drop is becoming more severe from month to month. Many still hope to get away with a black eye. But the risk of being stuck with the old goods is very high. Those interested in photovoltaics also monitor prices very closely and compare offers. Accordingly, many end customers are now waiting for the offered prices to fall further and are hesitating to place an order.
So everything now depends on where the journey takes you. How low do prices have to fall before demand increases again and a balance is achieved?
The production lines in China are already being shut down, and up to 50 GW are to be built in the country this year – in addition to the 80 GW to 90 GW already installed this year. But even if not a single new module came to Europe from China, we would need many months until the module backlog is cleared. The stored modules are also predominantly products with PERC cells, whose efficiencies are lower than those of modules with the latest technology. I doubt that these are suitable for increasing domestic demand strongly. These products are more likely to be used in markets outside of Europe, where people are happy about inexpensive solar modules. In my opinion, only when the existing glut of modules can be reduced will a healthy price level be able to be established in the market again. By then, however, a market shakeout will probably be seen in and some market participants will fall by the wayside.

However, most European renewable PPA prices rose in August, and the EURO Composite – Swiss consultancy Pexapark's global index, which averages PPA prices across different technologies and geographies – rose by an average of 1. 4% to end the month at €56.10 ($59.80)/MWh.
Italian PPA prices rose the most, at 12.8%, while French prices experienced the biggest decline, with a month-on-month drop of 5.7%, as French electricity futures fell due to an increase in nuclear production in August and confidence in the security of winter electricity supplies.
Only nine new PPAs for 193 MW were announced in August, down 83% from July, and significantly below any other month in 2023 thus far. The numerical average of deals has been more than 22 per month since the beginning of 2023.
Between July and August 2023, 1.34 GW of new PPAs were registered, or about 10% less than the nearly 1.49 GW of the same period in 2022.
Denmark accounted for 55% of the activity for the month, as five of the nine deals in August came from newly built photovoltaic assets in the country. Although only around 6% of Danish electricity production comes from photovoltaics – compared to more than 50% from wind – the vast majority of PPAs announced in the country are for solar assets.
The largest deal in August was closed in Sweden, with AstraZeneca's purchase of 200 GWh per year of onshore wind capacity from Statkraft. Another significant deal was Orange's purchase of 30 GWh per year of solar from Engie in Romania, which also represents the fourth PPA registered by Pexapark in the country.
In addition, Pexapark said that the first quarter of this year marked the start of a golden era for PPAs in Europe. During this period, 5.5 GW of new capacity was registered across 68 agreements, up more than 109% from the previous year. There was also a 95% quarter-on-quarter rise in the number of agreements.
In the second quarter, contracted volumes halved to approximately 2.6 GW, but the number of agreements remained similar, with a total of 65 PPA announcements. In July and August, there was another slowdown, which was to be expected for the period, but there were still more notable than in the same period a year earlier.
Pexapark said that one of the main challenges in 2023 has been the increase in the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and the fact that PPA prices have not kept pace with inflation-induced project costs. Concerns about changing legislation in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, could also have a negative impact.
However, Pexapark said that it remains optimistic, pointing to the record 9.5 GW (166 agreements) that have already been registered so far this year.
“Given that third quarter activity has not yet concluded and that the fourth quarter is still ahead – a typically intense quarter, as many deals rush to close before the end of the year – expectations around 2023 appear to be materializing,” the company said in his monthly “PPA Times” report.

Called HydraHeat, the new heat pump is manufactured by Rinnai in New Zealand and is specifically designed for climatic conditions with temperatures ranging from -10 C to 42 C, as well as coastal locations. The system is designed for outdoor installations and cannot be used as a swimming pool heater, or for hydronic applications.
It consists of a 1 kW top unit using heat pump technology that extracts thermal energy from ambient air and a 4.7 kW cylinder that can operate on electricity or in heat pump mode.
The system uses a circulation pump to draw water from the bottom of the storage cylinder, heat the water, and then return it to the cylinder at a higher temperature. The heat pump and the element in the tank are able to heat the water to a temperature of up to 70 C.
The new product reportedly operates in full heat pump mode down to -10 C without the need for electric boosting. It measures 1,750 mm x 510 mm x 1,240 mm and has a weight of 400 kg.
The heat pump has a water storage capacity of 275 L and a coefficient of temperature of 4.7. The rated heat pump input/output is 802 W/3,725 W and the hot water recovery rate is 89 L/h.
The system also features built-in defrost and frost protection functions. It comes with a 5-year heat pump unit warranty and a 7-year cylinder warranty. “Using the efficiency of heat pump technology, HydraHeat will heat a home’s water while saving you up to 75% on your water heating costs,” the manufacturer said.
The new product will be available for sale in November.

The Italian inverter manufacturer offers four versions of the new products, with outputs of 5 kW, 6 kW, 8 kW, and 10 kW. They all feature European efficiency ratings of about 98%, in addition to IP65 protection.
“With a wide operating voltage range of 160-950 Vdc, the new RS Hybrid three-phase inverters have two MPPT trackers,” Riello Solartech said in a statement. “The 5 and 6 kW models accept two strings while on the 8 kW and 10 kW models it is possible to connect three strings. The entire range allows a DC overload of 150% and has a nominal input current of 15 A.”
Each module comes equipped with a 5.3 kWh, 52 V battery. These batteries can use either lithium-ion or lithium-iron phosphate technology and support a maximum charging and discharging current of 100 A. They are installable in series, with the option to connect four to 10 modules to a single inverter, providing a total capacity of up to 53 kWh.
“Riello Solartech HV batteries self-configure automatically, without the need for complex manual settings,” the manufacturer said. “It is possible to connect up to 9 inverters in parallel, with each inverter being able to manage up to 10 battery modules equipped with a battery management system (BMS).”
The company noted that disconnectors and protections against overcurrent, overvoltage, and short circuits are integrated. In particular, Riello Solartech RS Hybrid three-phase inverters feature “type 2” DC and AC voltage-dependent resistors (VDRs).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/25/heat-pump-adoption-in-canada/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HEAT PUMPS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,CANADA",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 25, 2023",Heat pump adoption in Canada,"From pv magazine USA
Heat pumps are a way to heat and cool homes with electricity, and offer near zero emissions when powered by solar or other clean sources of energy, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The IEA further contends that they result in lower emissions even where electricity is generated by an emissions-intensive source. They can replace oil or gas furnaces, or in very cold climates, households may choose to retain their legacy heating system – just in case. However, recent advances in heat pump technology had made them much more efficient in cold climates, with the leading manufacturers announcing models designed for cold climates that do not need a backup heat source.
Canada, which has extremes of both cold and hot temperatures, has a goal of cutting emissions by at least 40% to 45% below 2005 levels by 2030 and it passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021, which calls for a net-zero target by 2050.
A recent report by the Canadian Climate Institute, “Heat pumps pay off,” states that Canadians are not embracing heat pumps in a way that is consistent with moving toward emissions targets. The report contends that Canadian households need more clarity on costs as well as government policy in order to speed adoption.
Researchers at the Canadian Climate Institute assessed lifetime costs of different heating and cooling combinations in different ages and types of housing across five Canadian cities to determine how heat pumps compare to the common combination of gas heating and air conditioning. They concluded that a heat pump is the lowest-cost option for most households over the lifetime of the system; however, barriers such as high upfront costs, lack of consumer confidence, the complexity of government rebate and loan programs, and the fact that residents usually have to own their own homes in order to benefit from some of the programs, thus eliminating renters, low-income households and others.
Five findings from the report:
Standard heat pumps, as opposed to cold climate heat pumps, were found to be the lowest-cost option for single, detached homes, regardless of the age of the home. For example, the report states that “whether a single-detached house in Montreal was built in 1940 or 2023, heat pumps with electric backup are consistently lower-cost than gas-fired heating with air conditioning”.
Cold climate heat pumps with backup, however, are a costlier option than standard heat pumps. But the report contends that as technologies improve, their upfront costs will fall to be more in line with standard systems.
Barriers to adoption
The report concludes that barriers to adoption include economic, behavioral, and struc­tural barriers. For example, upfront costs can be high, but many people are also reluctant to invest in a new technology. The report authors are optimistic that these barriers will resolve as the heat pump market matures; however, they indicate that the time is now to embrace clean technology. Rather than “locking in another generation of fossil fuel heating equipment,” the authors state that the next few years are a “window of opportunity” to upgrade homes and decarbonize the building stock.
The many programs in place to help Canadian residents decarbonize their households are too complex and “create a substantial administrative burden for households,” the report states. For example to apply for Greener Homes grant and loan programs, home energy audits are required, and households must pay for them without knowing whether they’ll qualify for a grant or loan. The result is that application rates are lagging by one-third of those needed to meet program targets.
The report makes several recommendations for enhancing policies, including the suggestion that the government maintain the schedule of planned carbon price increases. It also recommends that it’s important to maintain the existing financial support even as heat pump adoption accelerates – at least in the near term – conceding they may be able to sunset some programming as the market matures and costs fall. A final recommendation is to maintain support for lower-income households.

Fortescue Future Industries’ planned facility, officially proposed at the Willow Cale Industrial Park in Prince George, BC, will produce roughly 140,000 tons of hydrogen and 700,000 tons of ammonia per year, which would be used for both domestic use and export.
The project will need 1,000 MW of power from BC Hydro to produce green hydrogen by electrolysis, which will then be processed into green ammonia. The company has also started the environmental approval process required by the provincial government.
The project has taken considerable planning with local and regional leaders. In the latter part of 2021, Fortescue signed agreements with three First Nations groups in Canada, laying the ground for it to plan green hydrogen projects across Canada. This included the Lheidli T’enneh First Nation in British Columbia, with whom the company has negotiated a benefit-sharing agreement.
Billionaire Andrew Forrest, who founded FFI and is currently executive chairman at parent company Fortescue Metals Group (FMG), recently traveled to Prince George to announce the project proposal. Forrest met with Lheidli T’enneh First Nation Chief Dolleen Logan during his visit.
“[Prince George has] got clean air. It’s got heaps of water. It’s got heaps of electricity,” said Forrest. “It’s got everything going for it, and so this first 1,000 MW facility sounds really big, but it’s a stepping stone to what could be built out here in this beautiful part of the world.”
Earlier this year, the government of British Columbia offered the city of Prince George funding over a period of two years to help it become a regional hub for hydrogen. The provincial government has identified Prince George as an ideal location, given the industry’s foothold and promise in the region.

Tesla wants to set up a battery storage factory in India and has submitted a proposal to the Indian government. The US electric car and battery manufacturer, which makes the Powerwall range of battery systems, aims to target residential and industrial customers with its battery storage systems. 
Reuters reported that Tesla recently proposed a plan to support India’s battery storage capabilities with Powerwall, a system that can store power from solar panels or the grid for use at night or during outages. The company is keen to tap residential and industrial customers for its battery storage systems.
Tesla has sought a number of incentives to set up a battery storage factory in India. Indian officials have declined these incentives, but have offered to create a fair business model for the company by offering subsidies to customers for Tesla products, according to Reuters.
In the September issue of pv magazine, we examine booming solar markets in Brazil and Mexico; investigate whether TOPCon modules really are more susceptible to degradation than PERC products; attempt to unravel how US solar manufacturers can qualify for domestic content bonuses under the Inflation Reduction Act; and look at how homeowners can achieve the residential solar, battery, and EV dream.
Tesla recently showcased its new hybrid battery, the Powerwall 3, at RE+. It offers 11.5 kW of continuous power to homeowners and requires an installation time of between 30 to 40 minutes. It comes with an integrated inverter, which simplifies installation. As a hybrid system, it is suitable for new solar installations, but not for households with existing rooftop solar systems.

Energy storage, both at home and at the grid scale, is scaling to catch up with the growing supply of intermittent generation sources such as solar and wind. A new report from Interact Analysis shows that cumulatively, the United States is expected to reach 49.5 GW of installed and operational energy storage capacity. More than 10 GW is expected to be added to the cumulative total in 2023 alone. 
The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) found the average duration of these deployments to be about three hours. But the average duration has increased over the years.
Some batteries are used similarly to natural gas peaker plants, offering shorter durations to match times of peak electricity demand. Other batteries are designed as long-duration energy storage, storing eight hours or more of dispatchable energy to provide baseload grid support. About 90% of energy storage capacity is at the grid scale. 
An additional 31.4 GW of energy storage projects are in construction or planning phases, said the report. Interact Analysis said that about 24.7 GW of the 31.4 GW is represented by electrochemical batteries, commonly lithium based.
Texas leads the way for energy storage project capacity. About 51% of the nation’s planned, under construction, or installed and operational energy storage is installed in the state. For electrochemical storage, California and Texas have 16.3 GW and 16.4 GW installed respectively.  
New York is another notable center for energy storage development, setting a target for 6 GW of storage by 2030. Energy storage has also grown rapidly in Arizona in recent years as the state aims to reach 15% renewable energy by 2025. It represents about 5% of the nation’s planned, under construction, or operational energy storage.
Tim Montague of the Clean Power Consulting Group said that energy storage is about 10 years behind solar PV on the cost-adoption curve. Creative solutions to lower costs will be needed to meet the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory projection of a need for 60 TWh of energy storage by 2050, a nearly 100x increase from today.
“Several challenges must be addressed to fully realize this potential, including permitting and interconnection issues, workforce shortages and upgrading grid infrastructure,” said Montague.

“The Fraunhofer team is world-renowned for the fabrication of ultra-high efficiency solar cells based on silicon and III-V semiconductors such as GaInP or GaAs,” the Fraunhofer ISE said in a statement. “The AMOLF team has built up many years of experience in optimizing the management of light in solar cells. In this project, we brought this knowledge together, with this unique result. The solar cells have traveled between Freiburg and Amsterdam for the different processing steps, in this way building up the full solar cell.”
The cell is based on a TOPCon technology developed by the Fraunhofer ISE and a specially designed metal/polymer nanocoating provided by AMOLF. The latter is placed at the silicon sub-cell bottom and is reportedly responsible for optimizing the distribution of light scattering beyond the total internal reflection critical angle in the cell.
“Specifically, we optimize the geometry of a hexagonal array of silver (Ag) nano-disks that are integrated with the Ag back contact, and show how pitch, radius, and height of the individual scatterers control the distribution of power over different diffraction orders, while at the same time minimizing plasmonic dissipation losses in the wavelength range of interest,” the scientists explained.
They also used substrate conformal imprint lithography (SCIL), an innovative full-wafer scale nanoimprint technology, to fabricate the nanopatterned metagrating back-reflectors.
They then connected the top and bottom cells by direct wafer bonding at room temperature. The resulting solar cell has a size of 2 cm x 2 cm and includes front contacts, an anti-reflection coating (ARC), and a 1 μm thick Ag layer on the back side acting as an electrical contact and planar mirror. “After nanoimprint and etching the cells were shipped again to Fraunhofer ISE for a final HF dip followed by metallization,” they explained.
Through several numerical and experimental assessments, the Dutch-German group found that the multijunction device's external quantum efficiency (EQE) over a planar back-reflector improved by over 1.52 mA/cm 2.
“Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of nanophotonic light trapping for enhancing the efficiency of silicon-based multi-junction solar cells, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable solar energy technologies,” it stated.
