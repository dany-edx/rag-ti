The president of the European Commission, Ursula Von der Leyen, presented ways for member states to cut their overall electricity consumption, including a mandatory electricity usage reduction of at least 5% during peak price hours. Member states will be required to identify the 10% of hours with the highest expected price and reduce demand during those peak hours. They should also aim to reduce overall electricity demand by at least 10% until March 31, 2023.
Von der Leyen also defended the recent proposal for a cap on the revenues of renewable energy companies that produce electricity at low cost.
“These companies are making revenues they never accounted for, never even dreamt of,” von der Leyer stated. “In these times, it is wrong to receive extraordinary record revenues and profits, benefiting from war and on the back of our consumers. In these times, profits must be shared and channeled to those who need it most.”
The commission is proposing a limit of €0.18 ($0.18)/kWh on solar and wind, which have purportedly benefited the most from high gas prices. It is also proposing a limit on biomass, nuclear, lignite and some hydropower plants. The proposal is expected to save more than €140 billion, which will be used to help reduce bills for energy consumers.
According to SolarPower Europe, the cap is set uniformly in the European Union, but member states have the possibility to introduce further caps, without the approval of the European Commission.
“We greatly regret the possibility that is preserved for member states to set a lower cap on revenues at national level. This creates high uncertainty for investors and endangers the integrity and unity of the EU market,” said Naomi Chevillard, head of regulatory affairs at SolarPower Europe. “The European Commission should set a European-wide base-level of proportionality for the new cap measures.”
The association's initial reading of the proposal finds that the cap applies to revenue from all markets, including bilateral transactions, long-term markets, and short-term markets. The cap can be set at the settlement of energy, or after, which should allow power purchase agreements (PPAs) to be preserved from the measures, except if set below the €0.18/kWh proposed by the commission. Feed-in tariffs, contracts for difference, and corporate renewable PPAs are all safeguarded from the cap. The cap also does not apply to flexibility resources like storage and demand-side response. Demonstration projects and projects with installed capacities below 20 kW are also excluded, a spokesperson from the association told pv magazine.
The proposed income ceilings could be set at different levels for renewables and conventional power generators. Oil and gas companies could see a higher revenue ceiling for each kilowatt-hour sold into the wholesale electricity market due to their higher production costs. Fossil fuel companies will be expected to contribute through a “solidarity charge” instead. The charge would be collected by member states on 2022 profits, which are above a 20% increase on the average profits of the previous three years.
The revenue cap was classified as an emergency and temporary measure. It is intended to run from 1 December 2022 to 31 March 2023, and it still needs to be signed off in a extraordinary council meeting on September 30.
The commission wants to make a “deep and comprehensive reform of the electricity market” to decouple the dominant influence of gas on the price of electricity. It announced it is working on establishing a new benchmark price for electricity trading to replace the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF), which should reflect the recent dramatic changes to the gas market.
Collateral requirements to participate in exchange trading in the electricity market have risen astronomically, accompanying high electricity prices. The commission announced it will work with market regulators to amend rules on collateral to help companies with financing and liquidity challenges. It will also take measures to limit the intraday price volatility of electricity.
Von der Leyen also highlighted green hydrogen as a way out of Europe’s bleak energy situation.
“Hydrogen can change the situation completely for Europe. We have to move from a niche market towards a massive market for hydrogen,” said von der Leyen.
The commission’s RePowerEU plan doubled its green hydrogen production goal to 10 million tons by 2030. To achieve this, von der Leyen announced the creation of a new European hydrogen bank to fill the investment gap and match future supply and demand.
“This will help to guarantee supply of hydrogen using money from the innovation fund,” she said. “We will be able to invest €3 billion to help to construct a future hydrogen market.”
Von der Leyen also hinted that the restructuring of the electricity market would involve displacing the current merit order mechanism, in which the entrance price to the electricity market is determined by the power sources with the lowest running costs, solar and wind. Demand is then satisfied by working up from these sources until the required volume of energy is met. Generators selling into the wholesale market receive the price of the final, and therefore most expensive, electricity provider.
“My diagnosis is that the current electricity market design is based on the principle of merit order, which is not fit for purpose any more,” von der Leyer concluded. “It is not just for consumers. Consumers should reap the benefits of low-cost renewables.”
The Commission also proposed a regulation prohibiting the placement of goods made by forced labor on the EU market. The regulation will see products made by forced labor already in circulation withdrawn from the EU market. Enforcement will be carried out by member states' competent authorities in collaboration with customs authorities, on a risk-based approach.

They have also developed a method to produce boundary-free single crystals, which could pave the way to longer-lasting, safer batteries. “We now have guidelines that battery manufacturers can use to prepare cathode material that is boundary free and works at high voltage,” said Khalil Amine, an Argonne distinguished fellow. The team looked at cathodes made from both coated polycrystals and single crystals and subjected them to extensive analysis. It turned out that what they had believed were single crystals, as evidenced by electron and X-ray diffraction microscopy, actually had boundaries inside. Their calculations at the atomic scale also showed how boundaries lead to oxygen release at high voltage and therefore performance decline. They described their findings in “Origin and regulation of oxygen redox instability in high-voltage battery cathodes,” which was recently published in Nature.
Shell has agreed to team up with Israel-based Driivz to help accelerate the build-out of new charging locations in more than 10 European countries. It will use the Driivz EV charging and energy management platform, which provides real-time monitoring of chargers and remote self-healing capabilities. The Driivz platform is hardware-agnostic and supports many charger types and standards, providing Shell with a solution that is future-ready,  backwards-compatible for all OCPP protocols, and capable of roaming with other EV charging networks. The Driivz solution will integrate with Shell’s driver-facing “Shell Recharge” app. Shell’s ambition is to globally operate more than 500,000 charge points by 2025 and 2,500,000 by 2030.
Nissan has agreed to team up with US tech firm Femata Energy to offer bidirectional charging in the United States. The Femata Energy FE-15 charger has been approved by the Japanese carmaker as the first-ever bidirectional charger for use with the Nissan LEAF in the United States. The FE-15 bidirectional charger is available for commercial and government fleet owners. Nissan said that usage of the approved charger will not affect the Nissan LEAF’s battery warranty. The Nissan LEAF is currently the only fully electric passenger vehicle in the US market that is able to supply energy to the grid during peak energy demand times.
BMW and E.ON have launched a pilot project in Germany for bidirectional charging that will focus on the interplay between EVs and PV. Two families in the Munich area are currently testing the bidirectional charging technology in their everyday lives. Charging solutions and control boxes from E.ON were installed in the two households and tested with specially equipped BMW i3 vehicles. As part of the pilot project, the partners are examining the interplay between e-car batteries and PV systems. Excess electricity from the PV roof systems is used to charge the electric car and not fed into the grid. The companies said the PV system pays for itself even more quickly if the vehicle batteries are included for greater independence from the grid.
Svolt has confirmed that it will open a second battery cell plant in Germany. The new site at Lauchhammer, Brandenburg, is a former wind turbine plant owned by Vestas. The battery cells produced in Lauchhammer will be processed for the use in EVs such as at the future SVOLT site in Heusweiler, Saarland, with a planned production capacity of 24 GWh. The site in Lauchhammer will have a capacity of 16 GWh per year and will start production in 2025, said a company spokesperson. Svolt has not reveaöed which cells will be made in Brandenburg and Saarland.
Schneider Electric has launched a new EV charger that connects to home management systems to enable control of charging times and the monitoring of CO2 emissions. Its EVlink Home Smart charger can monitor EV power consumption in real time, predict spending, and set budgets in four different modes: “charge now,” “green charging,” “cost effective,” and “customized schedule.” A “green mode” will be available from next year, allowing homeowners to fully use their self-generated solar power. When integrated with Schneider Electric’s Wiser Home Energy Management system, homeowners can control all of their electrical devices and monitor their consumption through a single application. In addition, the Wiser App also provides updates on CO2 consumption, allowing homeowners to make better decisions on future savings.
Magenta Mobility has agreed to partner with Indian e-commerce retailer Flipkart to deploy 400 electric cargo vehicles for its fleet in Delhi. The move is aligned with Flipkart’s plans to introduce more than 25,000 EVs by 2030. Magenta Mobility operates an electric fleet of more than 500 vehicles in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Mumbai. The company plans to deploy a fleet of more than 500 EVs this year in Delhi, in order to meet the needs of organizations transitioning to clean mobility.

French solar developer TSE inaugurated its first agrivoltaic pilot project on Sept. 8, in Amance, northeastern France.
The pilot facility is equipped with TSE's agricultural canopy and a 2.4 MW shade with rotating solar panels fixed on cables 5 meters above the ground. The company also uses tracking algorithms via a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system to orient the PV modules according to climatic conditions. By optimizing this tracking algorithm, TSE hopes to be able to increase production between 10% and 20% compared to a conventional PV plant.
“We believe that it is possible to reconcile sustainable agriculture, green energy, redeployment of biodiversity and preservation of water resources. This is the meaning of the ambitious program that we have designed and that we are currently deploying in nine other sites in France,” said Mathieu Debonnet, the president of TSE.
The company said it will begin building three other pilot sites by the end of this year. It will conduct agronomic trial for nine years over an area of 5 hectares to demonstrate the effectiveness of the agricultural canopy on different crops. It has set up a joint research project with INRAE, a public research institute that focuses on agriculture, food and the environment.

Serentica Renewables, a step-down unit of Vedanta promoter Anil Agarwal’s Volcan Investments, will launch a renewable energy platform in India to provide round-the-clock carbon-free power to energy-intensive industries such as steel, cement, aluminum, and zinc. The platform will provide end-to-end green solutions to consumers, including connectivity to the appropriate transmission network. 
The company plans to install and commission 1.5 GW of solar and wind capacity in India in 24 months. It will build this capacity across multiple sites in the states of Karnataka, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra, where it has already acquired connectivity approvals. A large part of this capacity will be used to deliver close to 600 MW of round-the-clock clean energy to various entities of the Vedanta Group. 
Hindustan Zinc, an arm of Vedanta Group unit, signed an agreement on Sept. 2 with special-purpose vehicle Serentica Renewables India for long-term delivery of up to 200 MW of renewables.
“Serentica will also participate selectively in Government tenders subject to the project having synergies with its overall focus of providing direct green energy solutions to commercial and industrial customers,” said the company.
Over the medium-term, Serentica aims to install 5 GW of clean energy, coupled with different storage technologies. Eventually, it aims to supply more than 15 billion units of clean energy per year and displace 20 million tons of CO2 emissions. 
Serentica Renewables is 100% owned by Twinstar Overseas Ltd., a unit of  Volcan Investments. Twinstar Overseas also owns controlling stakes in Sterlite Power Transmission and Sterlite Technologies.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/14/model-to-assess-microclimates-in-vertical-agrivoltaic-systems/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,SWEDEN,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2022",Model to assess microclimates in vertical agrivoltaic systems,"Scientists at Mälardalen University in Sweden have developed a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model that facilitates the analysis of microclimates in vertical PV projects.
“Models of agrivoltaic (AV) systems will become frequently used for new AV system designs as well as decision-making as you can analyze/predict the microclimatic changes dependent on location and AV system solution,” researcher Sebastian Zainalli told pv magazine.
CFD simulations are used to solve complex equations about the flow of solids and gases through and around bodies, which can be used to analyze microclimates within agrivoltaic systems. The model was built using Solidworks computer-aided design software.
The researchers looked at a vertical agrivoltaic system with 30 bifacial monocrystalline PV modules with an east-west orientation in Västerås, Sweden. The system consists of three rows with 10 meters between them, where pasture grass is grown.
The scientists gathered data on the ambient temperature, global and diffuse horizontal radiation, and wind with four different sensors. They used a thermal camera to measure the temperature of the modules.
The CFD model showed PV module temperate estimation errors in the order of 0 C to 2 C, and ground temperature errors in the order of 0 C to 1 C.
“The vertical bifacial PV module temperature is hard to measure as you cannot easily put a sensor onto the module as it would create hotspots. Therefore, hourly thermal camera readings have been used to get an accurate comparison,” Zainali explained. “The model’s estimation errors are more accurate than the measured vertical bifacial PV module temperature obtained with monofacial reference cells on the rear and front sides due to differences in characteristics compared to the bifacial module.”
They also considered soil temperature to validate the CFD model. They claim the model correctly predicts that soil temperature slowly increases during the day.
“The CFD model had a temperature error of less than 1 C and it could be seen that the increase in temperature is extremely similar to measured data during the day,” said Zainali.
The results also show that the incident solar irradiance estimates from the CFD model are similar to those measured in Västerås, but the model generally underestimates the peak solar irradiance in cloudy weather conditions. The academic also observed a 38% decrease in solar radiation intensity in the ground areas shaded by the vertical PV modules.
“From these validations, we can see that our developed model has similar microclimatic variation as measurements,” Zainali said, noting that the model can be adapted to study other agrivoltaic systems designs and geographical locations. He noted that it is possible to analyze installations with fixed structures and trackers, although the latter adds more complexity to the modeling and therefore requires more time to be studied.

Australia has added another key ingredient to its plan to become a global green hydrogen superpower, with scientists from Geoscience Australia uncovering underground salt accumulations suitable for high-volume hydrogen storage, for both domestic use and export.
Hydrogen has been touted as a critical component of Australia’s renewable future, but much of the conversation has focused on the production and applications of the fuel. Geoscience Australia said widespread adoption of hydrogen as an energy carrier will also require large-scale storage options to buffer the fluctuations in supply and demand.
While hydrogen is most commonly stored in tanks, either in a gas or liquid state, Geoscience Australia said underground salt caverns offer a safe and cheap large-scale alternative. And the technology, which involves artificial caverns in naturally occurring geological salt deposits, is already gaining a foothold internationally.
Geoscience Australia said the nation also has the potential for high-volume underground storage of hydrogen in salt caverns. Resources Minister Madeleine King said Geoscience Australia had uncovered potential for the development of multiple underground caverns in salt deposits across the Canning Basin in Western Australia, the Adavale Basin in Queensland, and the offshore Polda Basin in South Australia.
“We know that the technology exists to store hydrogen underground and thanks to this work we now also know that Australia has the right geology to support the development of an economically viable hydrogen industry on our own soil,” she said.
King added that the discovery “demonstrates Australia’s monumental potential as a hydrogen superpower” … Large-scale cost-effective storage of hydrogen will be essential in achieving our long-term goals for the future. A single large salt cavern could provide the same amount of energy storage as Snowy Hydro 2.0 with multiple caverns this size possible in the same area.”
The Future Fuels Cooperative Research Centre has also mapped Australia’s underground hydrogen storage capacity. It said the country could potentially house 310 million tons (38,000 PJ), a figure approximately 60 times larger than what a developed domestic and export Australian hydrogen industry would need.

Renewable power producer Neoen Australia has filed planning documents to develop a standalone 1 GW /4 GWh battery energy storage system (BESS) near the town of Collie, Western Australia.
In planning documents lodged with the Shire of Collie, Neoen said the big battery will be built on a 31-hectare site about 12 kilometers northeast of Collie, approximately 215 km southeast of Perth. The company said the battery is expected to be constructed in five 200 MW/800 MWh stages “or as required to meet the evolving needs of the SWIS.”
The company is also seeking approval to build new switchgear, a 330/33 kV substation with step-up power transformers, and 330 kV overhead cables to connect to the existing Western Power transmission infrastructure. It said the staged approach to development means construction activities could span over 10 years, with each stage to generate up to 150 direct jobs.
The day-to-day operations and interactions with the wholesale electricity market (WEM) will be predominantly monitored and controlled remotely from the company’s Operation Control Centre (OCC) in Canberra which currently operates 14 existing projects across Australia.
Neoen says the Collie Battery is the key to unlocking future investment in, and uptake of, renewable energy in the state and helping to solve existing grid limitations by providing greater reserve capacity to the SWIS.
“System security risks are emerging now as the increase in large-scale renewable generation and distributed energy resources displaces the dispatchable thermal generators that presently provide all system security services such as inertia, frequency control, system strength, and voltage control,” Neoen said. “The proposed project will address these issues. There is significant potential for the project to address intermittencies in energy supply due to the ability of utility-scale battery facilities to respond quickly to fluctuations in the grid.”
Neoen said this week it has more than 2.5 GW of renewable assets in operation or under construction in Australia, representing more than AUD 3.5 billion ($2.4 billion) in investment. The company aims to reach 5 GW in Australia by 2025.

These plans include efforts to install a 1.3 GW floating solar project on Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the Philippines.
The project will likely require an investment of around $1.2 billion, the government of the Philippines said last week, without providing additional details. According to Inquirer, a media outlet in the Philippines, the project will begin commercial operations in 2024. This week, local developers Blueleaf Energy and SunAsia said in a statement that they will develop the massive floating array.
Macquarie Capital recently signed a letter of intent to invest in the Philippines through Blueleaf Energy.
According to a recent study, the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) began considering floating PV on the lake in 2016, when the first expression-of-interest process was launched. The report said that four pilot projects, ranging in size from 10 kW to 22 kW, have already been built at the lake.
“Laguna de Bay is a multiple-use resource where capture fishery and aquaculture are the most dominant uses,” the report said. “Thus, one of the main considerations is the allocation of area for floating solar farm.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/14/perovskite-quantum-dot-solar-cell-with-16-25-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2022",Perovskite quantum dot solar cell with 16.25% efficiency,"Researchers from Beihang University in China have designed a solar cell based on perovskite quantum dots (PDQs) that reportedly has a power conversion efficiency exceeding 16%. 
“Currently, the biggest challenges with this kind of cell are device photovoltaic performance and operational stability are poor,” researcher Xiaoliang Zhang told pv magazine. “If we will make the quantum dot solar cell stable enough and meet commercial standards, we strongly believe this type of solar cell is very promising and competitive with other solar cells.”
For the fabrication of the cell, the research group combined a precursor engineering of PQDs with a surface of covalent type iodide compound trimethylsilyl iodide (TMSI) and a chemical stripping treatment (CST) technique. This purportedly improves the orientation of PQD solids, while decreasing their intrinsic surface defects.
According to the academics, the presence of iodide is able to reduce to a large extent the surface trap states of PQDs and thus suppress trap-assisted nonradiative recombination. They also added nucleophilic trioctylphosphine (TOP) into the crude TMSI-based PQD solution.
“We conceived that the interaction between the TOP and PQD can be considered as a chemical stripping process,” the scientists said. “The results reveal that TMSI·TOP-based PQDs show decreased size with a narrower size distribution compared with that of TMSI-based PQDs.”
The researchers tested the solar cell under standard illumination condition and found the device achieved an efficiency of 16.25%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.23 V, a short-circuit current density of 17.73 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 0.745.
“Due to the high quality and iodine-rich surface of TMSI·TOP-based PQDs, the cells also exhibited good stability,” they said. “The improved photovoltaic performance of PQDSCs could be ascribed to the facilitated charge carrier transport within the PQD solids and substantially diminished trap-assisted charge carrier recombination, originating from the high orientation of PQD solids and improved surface chemistry of PQDs, respectively.”
They described the cell technology in “Highly Orientated Perovskite Quantum Dot Solids for Efficient Solar Cells,” which was recently published in Advanced Materials.
“We did not estimate the cost at this stage,” Zhang stated. “However, the fabrication of this type of solar cell is relatively easy compared with other solar cells, and also compatible with the scaleable fabrication approaches, such as using roll-to-roll spraying or printing techniques.”
Quantum dots based on perovskites have been particularly attractive to researchers working in photovoltaics, as they have already demonstrated efficiencies beyond 16%. Their potential advantages include high performance, fewer defects, better stability, simple fabrication methods, easy tunability to absorb different parts of the light spectrum, and production using more environmentally solvents. However, it will take a lot of work to fully understand PQDs and realize some of these advantages.

“The tree will be using monocrystalline cells with an efficiency of up to 24% which are encapsulated in a 3D shape to give an aesthetically pleasing design,” the company's chief product officer, Gerard Jansen, told pv magazine. “A series of these 3D-shaped ‘leafs’ together form the canopy which has a total diameter of 5 meters. The first version doesn’t use trackers but the cost-benefit of this is being analyzed for use in the future.”
The system is based on a supporting structure that makes use of a mixture of materials, including carbon fiber, metal and polymers. And according to the manufacturer, it is designed for quick and easy installation, so it can be packed for efficient shipment.
“The production is primarily in the UK and the product will be rolled out gradually capturing the largest global markets in a strategic way considering certification and logistic requirements,” Jansen said. “The target market for the tree is the commercial and industrial sector where the Tree brings aesthetic value to the surrounding real estate.”
Prices range from GBP 12,000 ($14,080) to GBP 16,000. The cost of the versions with energy storage and EV charging capabilities will depend on the energy and power capacity of the integrated hardware.
“This first-generation SolarBotanic Tree will eventually spawn a family of products, primarily aimed at the rapid Electric Vehicle charging market for homes, businesses and commercial car parks, where solar power can be captured and stored for charging points,” the startup said. “It will also encompass a sophisticated AI-driven energy storage and power management system (PMS), where trees can be linked and form part of a local grid, or feed into the main grid, essential to optimize an increasingly electrified future.”
The company plans to start selling the first systems in early 2023. It developed the solar tree technology in partnership with Co-Innovate, an initiative supporting small- and medium-sized enterprises in London by using academic and innovation resources at Brunel University London and the Manufacturing Technology Centre (MTC) in Coventry.
Despite their higher costs compared to conventional PV installations, solar trees might have a strategic advantage, as they occupy less space. According to recent research from South Korea, solar trees can possibly capture carbon and produce energy at the same time.
