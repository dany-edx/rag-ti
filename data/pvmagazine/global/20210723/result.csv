https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/23/oxford-pv-completes-100-mw-factory-build-out/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,EUROPE,GERMANY",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"JULY 23, 2021",Oxford PV completes 100 MW factory build out,"While disrupted by Covid-19 restrictions, Oxford PV is moving toward the initial stage of its production plans for its crystalline silicon heterojunction/perovskite tandem PV cells. The company’s initial 100 cell line, installed at a former CIGS solar module factory in the town of Brandenburg an der Havel, Germany, will produce 100 MW of the tandem cells – which may push efficiencies beyond 30% in the future.
“We will commence process integration first, qualification, ramp, and then full production,” Oxford PV CEO Frank Averdung told pv magazine. Averdung said the company will begin hiring the shift workers that will manage the production towards the end of 2021.
Oxford PV’s proprietary perovskite tandem technology involves depositing a thin layer of perovskite semiconductor material onto a crystalline-silicon (c-Si) heterojunction (HJT) base cell – creating the triple junction cell that delivers the high conversion efficiencies. The startup manufacturer, not surprisingly a spin off from Oxford University perovskite research activities, has move than 350 patents for its technology.
Meyer Burger, also an investor in the company, has supplied the HJT cell line and is acting as a turnkey supplier for the perovskite equipment. With the achievement of this milestone, Oxford PV has announced that its “exclusive relationship” with the Swiss company has come to an end.
The partnership between the two companies appears to have been a better fit while Meyer Burger remained a solar production equipment supplier. With Meyer Burger’s pivot to become a HJT module maker, the exclusivity aspect of the partnership may have hamstrung Oxford PV’s future manufacturing expansion plans. The two will presumably move forward as European PV cell manufacturing rivals.
In terms of production, Oxford PV CTO Chris Case points to the simplicity of the cell manufacturing process, despite its novelty and significant efficiency potential. “It is a relatively simple process,” says Case, “there are three machines for the perovskite, it also takes three machines for the HJT – effectively six big machines.” Case acknowledges that one of the perovskite tools is yet to arrive at the Brandenburg facility, however all other equipment and supporting production infrastructure is in place.
The 100 MW line will produce perovskite tandem cells on a M6 wafer format. “The product we are trying to make initially is focused on the rooftop,” explains Case. “And that makes M6 ideal for us, as the biggest module you can make for a single person rooftop installation is roughly 60 M6 cells.” The company has already produced 400 W+ modules based on cells from its R&D line.
Once the 100 MW line is ramped in 2022, Oxford PV will provide the cells to third party module assembly companies for completion. Notably, a feature of the Oxford perovskite tandem cells is that they have “half the current and twice the voltage” of standard c-Si PERC cell, meaning that cell cutting, into halves or third – commonplace today in PERC modules, particularly on larger M10 or M12 wafer cells – is not required.
An additional advantage of Oxford PV’s technology is that it requires significantly less silver in metallization than HJT. “Because it [the silver metallization paste] has to carry less current and silver is directly related to that, we definitely don’t have the same consumption as an ordinary HJT cell.” Case estimates the silver reduction, compared to standard HJT, as being around 50%.
Frank P. Averdung says that the company is in the “final stages” of a funding round that will allow the company to expand beyond the initial 100 MW line – to gigawatt scale. “We hope we will be able to communicate the closure of the funding very soon.”

This is the third consecutive drop since July 7. According to the trade body, several silicon factories came back to production from yearly maintenance and resulted in an increased output compared to June. Furthermore, it reports that 9,000 MW of the raw material was imported and that the total polysilicon supply for the period reached up to 50,000 MT, which should almost meet the market demand.
Shanghai-listed diamond wire cutting equipment supplier Gaoce Technology announced on Tuesday a plan to increase its PV wafer capacity by another 20 GW. A few weeks earlier, it had revealed the intent to invest in monocrystalline PV wafer production in Yancheng City, Jiangsu province. The new production unit will be located in Leshan City, Sichuan Province, where Tongwei has also planned to build more polysilicon capacity. Gaoce said the company will invest around RMB1.65 billion (US$256 million) in this project.
PV module manufacturer Hareon Solar has filed for bankruptcy with the People’s Court of Jiangyin City, Jiangsu Province on Thursday. The court stated in a document that, based on a qualified financial audit, Hareon has total owner's equity of minus RMB 5,850,861,239, which means the inability to pay off debts. The company will soon enter the bankruptcy liquidation procedure.
Independent shareholders at state-controlled manufacturer Luoyang Glass on Wednesday unanimously approved the RMB182 million ($28.1 million) acquisition of 60% of glassmaker Qinhuangdao North Glass Co Ltd from the China Yaohua Glass Group Co Ltd warehousing and sales entity, also controlled by Luoyang owner China National Building Material Group. Louyang is planning the help its PV glass business, including by expanding production.
Polysilicon maker GCL-Poly has announced plans to sell off another 28 of its solar project estate, amounting to around 301 MW of generation capacity, to state-owned entity Yixing Hechuang. The sale price of RMB481 million ($74.3 million) will book a net loss of RMB50.5 million ($7.8 million) but will generate total income of RMB1.16 billion ($179 million) for GCL while reducing its liabilities by RMB1.24 billion. Two of the PV projects being transferred to Shanghai Electric-owned Yixing Hechuang, which have around 22 MW of generation capacity between them, will be subject to a put option, said GCL on Wednesday. The GCL-Poly subsidiary selling the plants would have to buy those two back if they fail to be registered to receive subsidies within three years of the transaction.

It has the potential to reduce the overall weight of the system by 43%, storage system costs by 52% and the required manufacturing component count by 75%, based on a single-rack system with capacity to store five hydrogen cylinders,” reads the note published on Thursday. The storage system can be configured to hold varying numbers of hydrogen tanks, from five to 10. The new technology has already been installed in pilot trucks in Europe and is expected to be deployed across all vehicles beginning in Q4 2021. The development of this technology was a cross-Atlantic collaboration between Hyzon Europe and Hyzon U.S., with the company planning to produce this new system in both its Rochester, NY, and Groningen, the Netherlands, facilities.
Indian government-owned oil and gas corporation IndianOil has announced it will build India's first green hydrogen plant at its Mathura refinery. “IndianOil has a wind power project in Rajasthan. We intend to wheel that power to our Mathura refinery to produce absolutely green hydrogen through electrolysis,” chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidy commented on Friday. The company confirmed, however, its focus on petroleum refining and marketing. The company wants to add 25 million tonnes of refining capacity by 2023-24. “As we see it, the green hydrogen will replace carbon-emitting fuels used in the refinery to process crude oil into value-added products such as petrol and diesel. Moreover, we have got several expansion plans down the line which are already approved. We will not have a captive power plant and will utilise power from the grid, preferably green power. This will help decarbonise some part of the manufacturing,” added Vaidy.
The Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO), an executive body of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, has awarded a subsidy of €3.6 million to PosHYdon. The project in the North Sea is reportedly the world's first offshore green hydrogen pilot on a working platform. “With this subsidy the consortium can start up all activities for this pilot. The remaining budget will be funded by the consortium partners,” reads a note released on Thursday. Electricity generated by offshore wind turbines will power the hydrogen plant on the platform for two processes: converting seawater into demineralized water and electrolysis of water to produce green hydrogen. The aim of the pilot is to gain experience in integrating working energy systems at sea. “In addition, in this project the efficiency of an electrolyzer with a variable supply from offshore wind will be tested, and at the same time knowledge and insights on the costs for the offshore installation as well as maintenance costs will be obtained. The green hydrogen will be mixed with the gas and transported via the existing gas pipeline to the coast. The 1 MW electrolyzer will produce a maximum of 400 kg of green hydrogen per day,” the consortium wrote. Nel Hydrogen, InVesta, Hatenboer, IV-Offshore & Energy, Emerson Automation Solutions. Nexstep, TNO, Neptune Energy, Gasunie, Noordgastransport, NOGAT, DEME Offshore, TAQA and Eneco are part of the consortium. On Friday, the consortium reported that Nel ASA had also joined the agreement for the PosHYdon project. The Oslo-based company will provide an MW-scale PEM electrolyzer for the project.
The University of Strathclyde in the United Kingdom will lead the £10 million research Ocean-REFuel project, which will explore ways of converting ocean energy into fuels for use in heating, energy storage, and difficult to decarbonize transport applications. The project will last for five years. It will include industrial partners like BP, Scottish Power, National Grid, and ENI “The news comes as the U.K. prepares to host COP26, the UN Climate Change Conference, in Glasgow and the consortium includes world-leading research teams from the Universities of Nottingham, Cardiff, Newcastle and Imperial College London,” reads the note released on Friday. British Minister for Energy Anne-Marie Trevelyan underlined the relevance of the offshore wind sector for hydrogen production. Meanwhile, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) presented its report “Offshore Renewables: An Action Agenda for Deployment”. Francesco La Camera, Director-General of IRENA, commented: “Offshore renewables have the potential to meet more than twenty times of today’s global power demand.”
The European Commission has approved a €507.5 million German Federal scheme to acquire climate-friendly commercial vehicles that will apply until the end of 2024. “The scheme is open to undertakings from all sectors and offers direct grants for three sub-measures: (i) a premium of maximum 80% of the price difference between a carbon-friendly (pure electrical, plug-in hybrid, or hydrogen/cell-fuelled) commercial vehicle and that of a comparable conventional diesel model meeting the highest applicable emission EU vehicle class (currently EURO 6/VI standards); (ii) a maximum of 80% of the investment costs for charging facilities for electric vehicles for use by the acquiring undertaking, which may be made available for public use; and (iii) a maximum of 50% of the costs of environmental studies. Aid will be based on a competitive bidding process,” reads the note released on Thursday. The German government wants to incentivize a switch to climate-friendly commercial vehicles, especially for transport companies.
Boston-headquartered Advent Technologies announced that it had been nominated by the Greek Ministry of Development and Investment to be part of the first wave of the European Union’s Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) on hydrogen. Advent will be spearheading the Green HiPo project meant to develop, design, and manufacture fully scalable and highly efficient high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells for the production of power and heat. “Within seven years, Advent is set to support the full ramp-up to 400MW of renewable energy/electricity and 400MW of heat. The Green HiPo project will also create a manufacturing line of electrolyzers with a power level of 4.65GW,” reads the press release published on Thursday. Green HiPo is part of the €8 billion “White Dragon” plan for hydrogen technologies presented by leading Greek companies, intended to replace the lignite power plants of Western Macedonia.

German EPC contractor Goldbeck Solar has developed an arc-shaped PV system for applications in agrivoltaic projects.
Called MarcS, the system was developed in partnership with German mounting structure provider PMT and is said to enable more effective land use, increased profitability, and more efficient use of resources.
The arches have been designed to slide on the side rails so that the positions of the solar modules can be flexibly adjusted and the arable land underneath can either be exposed to, or protected from, the sun, depending on the farmer's need. At the same time, the solar modules offer animals and plants protection from extreme weather conditions such as hail, drought, or excessive sunlight. Furthermore, temperature, humidity, and light can be controlled and the quality of breeding and harvest can be optimized.
The assembly of the solar arches can be automated or at least semi-automated. It consists of rows of solar modules that are arched at a height of 2.50 to 3.50 meters. The arrangement connects the modules with the substructure to form a fixed static part that can span up to nine meters, according to Goldbeck Solar.
The modules are aligned with an east-west orientation with different angles of inclination, which increases the yield. The company estimated the additional yield at up to 30% compared to conventional ground-mounted systems and up to 60% compared to other agrivoltaic systems. It added that this technology can enable more than 2 MW of photovoltaic output per hectare.
From 2022, Goldbeck Solar intends to offer the “MarcS” mounting system in the Netherlands. A 45 MW pilot PV project is also currently being planned.

The new prototype, which the scientists described as deployable in simple embedded controllers, was developed with two different protocols: the Distributed Network Protocol 3, which is an open and optimized protocol developed for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems used by energy utilities to request data from substations using pre-defined control function commands; and the International Electrotechnical Commission 61850, which is an international standard defining communication protocols for intelligent electronic devices at electrical substations.
As for the software code for the DNP3 protocol, the NREL researchers used a DNP3 source code library from the Triangle MicroWorks’s (TMW’s) software platform, which provides software libraries, conformance testing software, protocol gateways, and OPC drivers/translators for industry-standard communication protocols, and the Distribution test manager, which is a software simulator from TMW that can simulate the DNP3 client and server.
For the IEC 61850 protocol, the scientists utilized IEC 61850 protocol source-code libraries, two types of software from TMW – the SCL Navigator and the Test Suite Pro. The latter is a Windows application with a set of tools for IEC 61850 testing and the former is an application for creating IEC 61850 System Configuration Language (SCL) files.
The prototype was assessed through a simulation testbed. “The setup runs the code in real time and uses a laptop to mimic the inverter controller actions, whereas the hardware setup uses an sbRIO inverter controller that was developed in the Additively Manufactured
Photovoltaic Inverter (AMPVI),” the researchers explained.
The research team, with the support of experts from TMW, was able to identify a translator that is able to exchange data between the IEC server and the DNP3 client inside the embedded controller. “The protocol translation module contains the mapping points to exchange information from IEC 61850 to DNP3,” it said. “The advantage of the developed module is that it can accept different mapping files.”
The group also created two different sets of codes. “The first code can be used directly to enable the IEC 61850 server on a PV inverter,” it specified. “The second code converts the data from the IEC 61850 client, initiates communication with a DNP3 client, and exchanges information with a DNP3 server through the DNP3 client.” According to the scientists, these codes enable utilities to “seamlessly” communicate to IEC 61850 and DNP3 distributed energy resources.
This interoperable module is claimed to enable legacy inverters, which are PV inverters that are not capable of providing some or all of the grid support functions to participate in advanced distribution management. “In addition, the interoperability code developed in this research work reduces the cost of adding additional communication protocols by inverter manufactures, which can result in cost savings to the customers,” the researchers said.
The standard SCADA software code was presented in the paper Enabling Interoperable SCADA Communications for PV Inverters through Embedded Controllers.

“The plant was built in an industrial park owned by Shandong Huaqin Group and Zhejiang Fortune Energy Co., Ltd,” a company's spokesperson told pv magazine.
The PV plant was completed in late 2020 by special purpose vehicle Jining Huaxi New Energy Technology Co., Ltd, which is jointly owned by the two above-mentioned industrial groups. Around RMB 600 million (US$92.7 million) was invested in the project.

That timeline was offered up by French-owned, Dublin-based renewables developer Power Capital Renewable Energy today as it announced it had acquired a majority stake in 400 MW of projects under development by Irish firm Terra Solar.
A press release issued by Power Capital – which was bought by Parisian private equity firm Omnes Capital in November – did not reveal what majority stake the Dublin developer would hold in the solar portfolio, nor how much it had paid for the controlling interest. The company did, however, estimate capital requirements of around €200 million to build out the project capacity, with that sum to be provided by Omnes and commercial loans, and to be invested over “the coming two to three years,” according to Power Capital director Peter Duff.
Construction is expected to start next year with the first plants set to be operational in mid 2023 and the portfolio to be fully built by 2027.
Terra Solar co-founder David Fewer said his company will retain a holding in the 400 MW portfolio, which it will develop alongside Power Capital, and also has a further 600 MW of solar in its pipeline.
“These sites represent over four years of intensive local engagement with landowners, communities and planners to ensure that Ireland develops high quality solar farms to help meet its 2030 renewable targets,” said Fewer, quoted in the press release. “From the outset, our priority has been to ensure that these sites are constructed to the highest standards to benefit all stakeholders and we are delighted to have found such a strong, long-term owner for these sites, in PCRE [Power Capital] and their French partners, Omnes Capital.”
The Irish government has announced an ambition to have 70% of its power generation fleet based on renewables this decade. The International Renewable Energy Agency has estimated the EU member state had just 40 MW of grid-connected solar capacity at the end of 2020.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/23/residential-solar-demand-is-through-the-roof/,"MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JULY 23, 2021",Residential solar demand is ‘through the roof’,"From pv magazine USA
Solar pros offered a bullish outlook about growth prospects for residential solar for the rest of 2021 and into 2022 as the industry works to put the pandemic slump of 2020 into the rearview mirror.
Demand for residential solar installations is “through the roof,” said Eric White, CEO of Dividend Finance, a top three provider of solar loans that partners with contractors to provide homeowners with financing.
He said that the residential solar market is throttled somewhat by supply chain and labor availability concerns, along with transportation and logistics bottlenecks. Even so, loan demand has grown 100% between the second quarter of 2020 and 2021. He said he expected no softening of demand through the end of the year and that the total number of projects that make it through to completion could grow by as much as 35-40% compared to last year.
White spoke during a recent webinar hosted by Philip Shen of Roth Capital Advisors. They were joined by Dan Javan, president and CEO of Suntuity, a top-10 solar installer; and Chuck Norris, strategic account manager with Gexpro, an electrical supply house.
Javan said that demand growth has been fueled in part by the emergence of origination platforms Solo and Nomo Energy, which got a boost in the stay-at-home days of the pandemic. As a result, they moved from little more than a blip on the project origination chart to spawning 20,000 to 25,000 transactions a month, each.
The online platforms marry origination and delivery capacity. “Covid led to a pivot to these platforms,” Javan said, and their backers have put a lot of capital into building them out.
Given the relative novelty of these platforms, White said that many forecast analysts have “grossly underestimated” residential solar growth.
Norris agreed that growth is exceeding projections based on what was expected to be a recovery from 2020. He said that supply chain issues mean that “everything that can be produced is being installed.” The rising tide seems to be lifting all boats, including manufacturers with smaller market shares. He said that rapid demand growth is likely to continue through the end of the year, even breaking through what traditionally has been a seasonal slowdown in the winter months.
Both seasonality and the overall economics of a residential rooftop solar installation are less of a concern to potential solar customers who are eager to install a system, he said.
One question is whether or not manufacturers can keep up with the demand. Norris said that he was less concerned about the availability of modules than he is about the supply of inverters. He said that inverter production has increased more slowly than demand, in part due to manufacturers’ worries about exposed capital if demand slows.
No less worrisome is the supply of semiconductors, whose constrained supply has troubled a range of electronics-based industries, including auto-making. The solar industry is at a disadvantage when it comes to competing against industrial behemoths for scarce chip resources and other raw materials.
“The supply chain can barely keep up with demand,” Javan said. “If you build it, we will consume it.”

Energy Renaissance announced it had received an additional AUD 525,072 ($387,081) grant from the federal government’s Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre (AMGC) to put towards scalable processes and workforce skills at its pilot manufacturing facility in Tomago, just north of Newcastle in the state’s Hunter region.
Dubbed Renaissance One, the facility will be the flagship of Energy Renaissance, which intends to ramp up production to 5.3 GWh per annum of its trademarked lithium-ion superStorage batteries for Australia and southeast Asian markets in the coming years. The facility is slated for completion in February 2022.
Tomago, on the outskirts of Newcastle, has access to both a world-class port and a heaving skilled labour force from its long history in coal mining. Importantly, it is also home to the CSIRO’s Energy Centre research hub – a long partner of Energy Renaissance.
Energy Renaissance has previously received $246,625 from the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre to develop its unique hot-climate-optimised battery modules — the cell housing — that can be scaled for numerous applications from battery packs suitable for installation at the base of a streetlight, to commercial-size and grid-supporting energy storage. This new set of funding, the company said, “will allow rapid testing and the development of a scalable, manufacturing line and trained workforce that will inform the technology, systems and processes for Renaissance One.”
“AMGC has played a strategic role by supporting Energy Renaissance with a seed funding round last year that went towards the design and prototyping of our superStorage battery. The new funding injection from AMGC will now help us to scale up towards commercial production and accelerate our ability to manufacture batteries faster. This is a win for Australia, our economy and workforce as we ascend the stage to become a global battery manufacturing powerhouse,” Energy Renaissance’s Technology and Development Director, Brian Craighead, said.
In a recent report from the Future Battery Industries, the body outlined that for Australia to truly seize on the opportunity afforded by the imminent global battery boom, it needs to look beyond its historic role as a supplier of raw materials and broaden its horizons by adding value with downstream products and manufacturing. This drive to bring renewable manufacturing back onshore is catching wind, with Queensland Minister for Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen, Mick De Brenni, just this morning calling for the “re-industrialisation of our nation,” singling out the storage industry in particular.
“Australia relies heavily on imported batteries, a reliance Energy Renaissance is committed to changing. By investing in local manufacturing, upskilling a new workforce for manufacturing and developing an innovative battery solution, Energy Renaissance will showcase how Australia can and will have a global competitive edge in battery manufacturing,” AMGC’s Managing Director, Dr Jens Goennemann said.
Energy Renaissance says its Tomago pilot project “will validate the sovereign capabilities that Australia has for the manufacturing of energy storage systems and demonstrate a stronger and more integrated Australian supply chain for key battery components and battery management systems.” The ultimate goal not only for the company but for the Australian storage industry more generally is to capture a greater share of supply-chain value-adding.
In a previous interview with pv magazine Australia, Energy Renaissance’s Managing Director, Mark Chilcote, said the fact battery manufacturing is still a burgeoning industry in Australia will make it something of an exercise in skills transfer. “Anyone currently operating a chemical plant or a gas plant could be reskilled [for Renaissance One],” Chilcote said. “There’ll be a lot of work for chemists and scientists, engineers, plenty of opportunities for graduates and interns.”
The initial production capacity of Renaissance One will be 66 MWh per annum, and the company expects to export more than half of its output through the Port of Newcastle.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/23/japan-revises-2030-targets-plans-to-double-renewables/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,JAPAN",BLAKE MATICH,"JULY 23, 2021","Japan revises 2030 targets, plans to double renewables","The unprecedented Tokyo Olympic Games mean the world’s attention is focused on Japan, and The Land of the Rising Sun’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has taken the opportunity to revise its draft energy plan for 2030. The new plan sees an ambitious doubling of renewables and significant cuts to coal and gas. What is more, the draft plan also proposes the building of a hydrogen supply chain. 
The move comes in response to pressure from U.S. President Joe Biden, the upcoming Glasgow climate change conference in November, and the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) “Japan 2021 Energy Policy Review”, published earlier this year, in which IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol described the challenge ahead of Japan as “considerable”, and warned that even if Japan met its 2030 climate goals (pre-revision) “a very significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions post-2030 will be necessary if Japan is to realise its ambition of achieving carbon-neutrality by 2050.” 
The new draft plan looks to cut Japan’s emissions by 46% (from 2013 levels) up from the original goal of 26%. To achieve that the world’s third largest economy needs renewables to account for 36-38% of its energy generation mix by 2030, a significant increase from the previous target of 22-24%. 
On top of that, the coal target has been revised down from 26% to 19%, and gas, upon which Japan relies heavily, is to be reduced from 56% to 41%. Amongst all this change, Japan’s nuclear target has remained unchanged at 20-22%. 
Interestingly, Japan has included new fuels like hydrogen and ammonia in its new draft plan, which it says will contribute 1% of the energy mix by 2030. However, the plan did not specify these new fuels had to be green.

Japanese Prime Minister Suga originally announced the revised 46% reduction in emissions at the April Leaders Summit on Climate, hosted by US President Biden. At the Summit, Suga said the reduction “would mean that Japan will raise our current target by over 70%, and it will certainly not be an easy task. However, by defining a top-level ambitious target befitting to a next growth strategy of the nation which underpins manufacturing in the world, Japan is ready to demonstrate its leadership for world-wide decarbonization.” 
What is not clear is just how Japan can increase its renewable generation so significantly over the course of the decade. The country is already so short on useable land that it is ripping up golf courses and replacing them with solar farms, utilizing floating PV on lakes and reservoirs, and looking to invest strongly in wind. However, much of the waters around Japan are too deep for traditional wind turbines, and floating wind turbines are still technologically nascent. 
Considering Japan is the largest buyer of Australian coal and thermal coal, and the world’s largest importer of LNG (buying $15 billion worth of Australia’s LNG exports in 2020), there is no doubt that Japan’s revised ambitions will have an impact on Australia, and perhaps particularly on the Morrison’s government’s controversial “gas-led recovery”, toward which it has already committed to funding private industry to the tune of $224 million for the development of onshore gas fields in the Northern Territory’s (NT) Beetaloo Basin.
