The German steel producer said the project has demonstrated “the world's largest high-temperature electrolyzer,” manufactured by German electrolysis specialist Sunfire. Based on solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) technology, the electrolyzer runs at an operating temperature of 850 C and uses waste heat from Salzgitter's steel production processes. “For the first time, the electrolyzer produced 200 Nm3 of green hydrogen per hour. We are also able to prove an electrical efficiency of 84% el,LHV. This is a level of efficiency that no one else has achieved before. By comparison, other electrolysis technologies, such as Alkaline or PEM, only reach efficiencies of around 60% el,LHV,” said Simon Kroop, a project leader for Salzgitter Mannesmann Forschung.
Plug Power has signed an agreement with Walmart for an option to deliver up to 20 tons per day of liquid green hydrogen to power-material-handling lift trucks at Walmart warehouses across the United States. “This is one of the first green hydrogen supply contracts for Plug, validating the company's multi-year investment in its green hydrogen network,” US-based Plug Power said on Tuesday. 
EDF has unveiled its new hydrogen strategy, with plans to develop 3 G.W. of electrolytic hydrogen projects throughout the world by 2030. “These projects, which will require between €2 billion ($2.2 billion) and €3 billion in investments, will be developed and co-financed within the framework of industrial partnerships and by benefiting from national and European support mechanisms,” said the French energy company.  
Total Eren has awarded a conceptual engineering contract to Wood for a large-scale green hydrogen production facility in southern Chile. “The engineering package will include up to 10 GW of installed wind capacity, coupled with up to 8 GW of electrolysis capacity, a desalination plant, an ammonia (NH3) plant, power transmission and backup, and port facilities to transport the green ammonia to national and international markets,” Wood said last week. The H2 Magallanes Project is part of Chile's plans to develop 25 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030, based on solar and wind resources. 
European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans met with the Egyptian government last week in Cairo to discuss a renewed energy collaboration, including the Mediterranean Green Hydrogen Partnership and cooperation on LNG supplies. “We agreed to move fast to expand cooperation on climate action and the clean energy transition,” said Timmermans. The Mediterranean Green Hydrogen Partnership involves hydrogen trading between Europe, Africa and the Middle East. European institutions want to invest in “large-scale rollout of renewables,” said Timmermans. 
Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi recently traveled to Algeria to sign a bilateral energy cooperation plan between the two countries, primarily focused on gas. “Italy is ready to work with Algeria to develop renewable energy and green hydrogen,” Draghi reportedly said.
Transgaz has agreed to share best practices and identify hydrogen markets with GAZ-SYSTEM of Poland, EUSTREAM of Slovakia, and FGSZ of Hungary. The Romanian natural gas transmission system operator said that the group will also draft a relevant regulatory framework and prepare a feasibility study, with plans to explore the decarbonization of their operations and the transport of green gases.
Scania has started working on a project to develop an initial set of 20 fuel cell electric trucks that will run on green hydrogen, in cooperation with Cummins. The Swedish automotive manufacturer said on its website that the 20 trucks will be delivered to HyTrucks in 2024, “once Cummins has added fuel cells” to them. HyTrucks is a joint initiative in the Netherlands between Air Liquide and the Port of Rotterdam Authority.
Cummins has also announced a contract to supply a 2.5 MW electrolyzer to Hysetco, a hydrogen mobility company owned by Total Energies, Air Liquide, and Toyota. The electrolyzer will enable local hydrogen production to power a Hysetco project in Paris. Indiana-based Cummins said the plan is to develop and operate the “world's first large-scale hydrogen mobility platform,” starting with “the largest hydrogen taxi fleet worldwide.”
Cornell University and two Cornell research startups have joined a consortium that aims to propose a northeastern US research hub for hydrogen. With approximately $9.6 billion available in federal funding, the US Department of Energy is expected to start requesting proposals in early May for regional hydrogen centers, including research and demonstration projects. The group plans to apply for a portion of that federal funding, Cornell University said. Other New York universities that are participating in the consortium include Columbia University, Rochester Institute of Technology, New York University, Stony Brook University (SUNY), City College of New York, and University at Buffalo (SUNY). The New York-led consortium includes the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey.

A new document from the provincial office of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology shows that the company plans to build a new factory in an industrial park in the Xinjiang region. The facility will have eight production lines with capacities of 1,200 metric tons (MT) per day each. Production is scheduled to begin in June 2023, with a total solar glass capacity of 3,000,000 MT per year.
Tongwei has announced new solar cell prices, with increases for all of its monocrystalline PV products. The polysilicon supplier and solar cell maker priced its PERC 182 mm cells at CNY 1.17 ($0.18) per watt, up 1.7%, and its PERC 166 mm cells at CNY 1.13 per watt, up 1.8%. It also increased the price of its PERC 210 mm cells by 0.9% to CNY 1.17 per watt. The company's cell prices have been trending upward since the beginning of 2021, and are now 15% higher from the levels recorded on June 30, 2021.
JA Solar has recorded a turnover of CNY 41.3 billion for fiscal 2021, up 60% from a year earlier. It posted a net profit of CNY 2.04 billion, up 35% from 2020. The PV module manufacturer attributed the strong growth to module shipment increases and rising panel prices. It said it also optimized supply chain management, which contributed to its strong performance.
Maxwell Technology has secured an order for eight heterojunction production lines with a total capacity of 4.8 GW from Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd., the parent company of Norway-based solar panel manufacturer REC.
Solargiga said its Qujing Yangguang solar ingot and wafer production unit will raise an estimated CNY 249 million by issuing convertible bonds equaling 6.95% of the existing business. The bonds will be purchased by Solargiga directors Tan Xin and Tan Wenhua for CNY 26.30 per share, the company said on Thursday. Some of the funds will be used to finance solar ingot and wafer production equipment, it said.
Shanghai Electric has recorded a CNY 423 million hit to its 2021 earnings due to its 20% stake in an abandoned thin-film PV module manufacturing project. The state-run energy company said it contributed CNY 250 million to a planned copper, indium, gallium, selenide (CIGS) solar module plant that was halted “due to changes in [the] market and other factors.” The loss comes at a tough time for the utility, which has also made a CNY 1.04 billion provision for losses this year from the Dubai Solar Thermal Photovoltaic Project. 
China Power International Development’s annual report for 2021, published this week, shows that the company’s solar plants generated a profit of CNY 574 million last year, up from CNY 541 million in 2020. Its coal-fired power plants posted a loss of CNY 2.08 billion, from a CNY 523 million profit a year earlier. The company said 7.09 TWh of the 98.8 TWh of electricity it generated in 2021 was produced by its PV projects. Coal-fired power accounted for 62.9 TWh of the total. China Power’s generation fleet includes 8.34 GW of solar capacity, as well as 30 GW of coal plants.

UAE-based Amea Power said in a statement that it secured two projects with a capacity of 36 MW each in the procurement exercise, without disclosing the final prices of the projects.
“Being awarded a total capacity of 72MW in Morocco is another great milestone for AMEA Power,” said the company's chairman, Hussain Al Nowais. “Morocco is a significant market for us, as it has established itself as a regional leader in clean energy pushing forward large-scale renewable energy projects.”
Masen and the Ministry of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development have yet to issue official statements on the matter.
ESI Africa, meanwhile, has reported that 13 of the 14 projects that were expected to be assigned through the tender were already awarded to private companies. These include Moroccan energy company Taqa Maroc (48 MW), Italian renewable energy company Enel Green Power (48 MW), and French developer Voltalia (117 MW).
The project sites are located near Sidi Bennour, Kelaa Sraghna, Taroudant, Bejaad, El Hajeb and Ain Beni Mathar. The selected projects will be part of the first phase of the Noor PV II project, under which several PV arrays will be built across eight different locations.
Morocco intends to build at least 2 GW of generation capacity under the Noor Solar Plan. The country's energy strategy, launched in 2009, aims to increase the share of renewable energy in its electricity production capacity to 42% by 2020, and to 52% by 2030.

Mark Phillips, prime minister of the South American nation, paid a site visit to the solar field in Batica a week ago and told his government's Department of Public Information website the project was 90% complete and would be handed over by June 1.
The installation is being constructed by the local business of Trinidadian equipment supplier Farfan & Mendes and the Caribbean unit of German solar developer Soventix at a town near the confluence of the Essequibo and Mazaruni rivers.
The project is being funded by the Inter-American Development Bank, a multilateral lender for Latin America and the Caribbean, as part of a program to strengthen Guyana's Department of Energy and the nation's generation mix. It will feed power into the grid operated by state-owned utility Guyana Power and Light.
The Department of Public Information reported 95% of the project's workers are Guyanese. Under Guyana's Low Carbon Development Strategy 2030, solar generation and battery storage will be used to meet electricity demand in rural areas for the next five years as part of a plan which will rely on natural gas and hydro to power urban centers.

The system has a power output of 1.07 MW, with 570 kW are provided by the solar array and 495 kW by Panasonic's own fuel cell systems. It also relies on lithium-ion batteries with a combined storage capacity of 1.1 MWh. The Kusatsu site has a peak demand of around 680 kW and an annual power demand of around 2.7 GWh.
The pilot facility occupies a surface of around 6,000 square meters. It is purportedly the world's first attempt to create a factory powered by 100% renewables through the full-scale use of hydrogen.

“Through this demonstrator, we will acquire know-how and data related to energy management, including the operation of pure hydrogen fuel cells,” the manufacturer said. “The generated power will cover all the electricity needed by the manufacturing department of the fuel cell factory in the Kusatsu base.”
The facility was built with 99 Panasonic H2 Kibou fuel cell systems with capacities of 5 kW each. The system works with pure hydrogen at a density of more than 99.97%, and achieves electrical efficiency of 56%. It measures 834 mm × 417 mm × 1,766 mm and weighs 205 kg, including the design panel.
The fuel cell generator can be used with an operating temperature between -10 C and 40 C, at altitudes not exceeding 500 meters. During power outages, it is able to generate electricity and to use up to 2.5 kW of its capacity for at least 120 hours.

Now, a newly announced partnership between Quantum Power Asia and German PV developer ib vogt could see that 2022 target achieved in one fell swoop, as the pair aim to construct a $5 billion 3.5 GW solar and storage facility in Riau, Indonesia. However, rather than serving Indonesia's renewable energy transition needs, the project development partners plan to export the plant's 4 TWh of annually generated solar energy to Singapore. 
Indonesia's Riau Archipelago consists of 1,796 islands between Sumatra, Borneo and the Malay Peninsula, south of Singapore. Quantum Power Asia and ib vogt plan to construct a 3.5 GW solar plant on a 4,000-hectare site in the archipelago, with a storage capacity of 12 GWh. The electricity will be exported to Singapore via an undersea cable.
The Anantara project comes in response to a request for proposals by Singapore's Energy Market Authority (EMA) to supply and import clean energy from neighboring countries, as it looks to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Once it is fully commissioned in 2032, Quantum Power Asia claims the project could cover approximately 8% of Singapore's annual electricity needs. 
“Should we be successful in being awarded an import licence to Singapore, we will bring up to $5 billion of capital into Indonesia from Singapore, creating more than 30,000 jobs,” said QPA Managing Director and CEO Simon G. Bell. “It will also contribute significantly to Singapore's journey towards carbon neutrality.”
Ib vogt CEO Anton Milner agreed, describing the plan as “a landmark project globally … we are confident we have submitted a compelling proposal to EMA in order to create sustainable long-term value both for Singapore and Indonesia.” 
Singapore's Union Energy Corp. (UEC) has also partnered with the Anantara project to distribute the electricity to residential, industrial and commercial customers. 
“The recent volatility of energy prices and challenges faced by Singapore's electricity market underscores the urgent need to review our supply of renewable energy,” said UEC CEO Ellen Teo. 
Solar-powered Singapore 
Of course, this is not the first mega-scale PV project slated to import solar energy to Singapore via undersea cables. The proposed $19.2 billion Australia-ASEAN Power Link project, the brainchild of Singapore-based Sun Cable, is set to feature at least 14 GW of prefabricated and pre-wired 5B Maverick solar panels in Australia's Northern Territory. The project will be backed by an estimated 33 GWh of battery storage, and transported via a 3,800-kilometer, high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) submarine cable from Darwin, Australia, to Singapore.

Of course, the length of undersea cable between the Riau Islands and Singapore is far shorter, but given Singapore's hunger for clean energy, there is more than enough space in the market. For example, United Arab Emirates state-owned renewables company Masdar signed a deal in January 2021 with Singapore's Tuas Power, French energy group EDF, and Indonesian state-owned utility PT Indonesia Power to explore the development of 1.2 GW of solar and a potential storage facility in Indonesia for export to Singapore.
Currently, approximately 95% of Singapore's electricity is generated from natural gas.

The open-circuit voltage is between 46.61 V and 47.64 V and the short-circuit current is between 18.03 A and 18.22 A. The panel can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and operating temperatures of -40 C and 85 C.
The module measures 2,384 mm x 1,303 mm x 35 mm and weighs in at 38.3 kg. It also features an IP68 enclosure rating, 2 mm tempered glass, an anodized aluminum frame and multi-busbar (MBB) technology. The module also has a temperature coefficient of 0.31%.
“This allows Aurora Pro products to have higher output in high-temperature working conditions, especially in Africa, the Middle East, and other areas with high climate temperature and good light conditions,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The new product comes with a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year performance warranty. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1% and 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.4% of the nominal output power.
“The panel can be suitable for application scenarios of utility project, industrial and commercial roof project, and also like floating systems and other special use scenarios,” the spokesperson said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/19/ultra-thin-perovskite-organic-tandem-solar-cell-with-24-0-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 19, 2022",Ultra-thin perovskite-organic tandem solar cell with 24.0% efficiency,"A group of scientists from the University of Wuppertal in Germany has developed a perovskite-organic tandem solar cell with optimized charge extraction, a high open-circuit voltage, and a thickness of just 1 µm.
“Our solar cells are basically the weight of the substrate we are processing them on and can be processed on almost any smooth substrate that one could think of – from the roof of cars over building facades, backsides of mobile phones, to plastic foils or could even be integrated into clothes,” researcher Kai Brinkmann told pv magazine.
The tandem configuration includes a narrow-bandgap organic subcell with a p-i-n-type architecture based on the polymer PM6 and molybdenum oxide (MoOx) as the hole extraction layer (HEL). The cell has a power conversion efficiency of 17.5%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.87 V, a short-circuit current of 26.7 mA cm−², and a fill factor of 75%. The wide-bandgap perovskite subcell was built with a perovskite known as FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.5Br0.5)3, with an efficiency of 16.8%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.34 V, a short-circuit current of 15.6 mA cm−², and a fill factor of 81%.
The scientists tried to reduce interfacial losses between the two cells, which are responsible for limiting the open-circuit voltage in tandem devices. They used an interconnect based on a 1.5 nm ultra-thin metal-like indium oxide layer grown via atomic deposition layer with unprecedented low optical and electrical losses.
“We leveraged the unique property of ALD to provide utmost control of layer thickness even at the level of ångströms, which is impossible with conventional deposition techniques,” they said.
The ultra-thin interconnect is claimed not to introduce notable optical losses and to boost the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the organic back-cell and the overall short-circuit current of the tandem device by about 1.5 mA cm −2 compared to a reference cell with an interconnect based on 1 nm of silver, which results in an efficiency of only about 20%.
By contrast, the tandem solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.0%, an open-circuit voltage of 2.15 V, a short-circuit current of 14.0 mA cm−², and a fill factor of 80%.
“The high EQE values (>95%) in the wavelength region between 400 nm and 500 nm can be explained by optical effects associated with the high refractive index of the perovskite material, which affords an efficient in-coupling of light into the active medium in this spectral range,” the research group said. “The high open-circuit voltage of 2.15 V of the tandem cell results from an almost ideal addition of the J-V characteristics of the subcells without any loss in open-circuit voltage.”
They described the solar cell in “Perovskite–organic tandem solar cells with indium oxide interconnect,” which was recently published in Nature. Fraunhofer ISE CalLab certified an efficiency of 23.1%, according to the IEC 60904-3 procedure.
“At the time we started this project, perovskite/organic tandems were just around 20% efficient. We are now at 24% and simulations show that our concept should allow us to reach efficiencies even beyond 30%,” Brinkmann concluded.

NREL has presented eight “key learnings” in a newly published report, often in the form of projections. Below is a condensed version.
Battery deployments in the United States will boost storage capacity to 200 GW and 1,200 GWh in 2050 in the reference case, as shown in the image above. Pumped hydro storage capacity will not increase.
Lithium-ion batteries will continue to have the highest market share “for some time,” as system costs for four-hour storage, including all system components and installation, fall to $200/kWh capacity by 2030, and continue to decline. Other technologies “could have new opportunities” if they can compete with battery prices.
The ability to provide firm capacity – which is the greatest value of storage – depends on the fit between storage duration and the duration of the region’s net peak load. Firm capacity enables storage to meet demand during system peak times and to replace gas turbines.
“Time shifting,” or saving energy for discharge at times of high demand, provides a smaller but still significant portion of the value of storage. Providing operating reserves adds minimal value, due to “saturation” of reserve requirements from storage deployed for other reasons. The value of deferring transmission by adding storage was not estimated, as it is “difficult to isolate, and very regionally specific.”
Given the “largely untapped potential flexibility in end-use electricity demand,” storage faces competition from grid flexibility options such as time-varying retail rates and industrial demand response.
Storage and solar power are complementary, as increased deployment of PV shortens the peak net load period, so that shorter-duration storage, at lower cost, can pair with PV to provide firm capacity. The lower costs to provide firm capacity translate to increased storage deployments.
Driving a trend in the opposite direction, as storage deployments increase, the net peak loads become wider, requiring longer-duration storage to provide the same level of firm capacity. As a result, storage durations “will likely increase” as storage deployments increase. As shown in the image above, deployment of six-hour batteries would start around 2034 in a reference case, and deployment of eight-hour batteries would start around 2040. This dynamic “presents opportunities” for emerging technologies capable of longer durations, “or even for the next generation of existing technologies” such as pumped storage hydropower.
Customer adoption of building-level storage will increase as storage costs decline and if the value of backup power is perceived to be higher. Overall, the customer adoption potential will be lower than the economic potential due to long payback periods. At low battery costs and very low PV costs, distributed storage could reach 82 GWh by 2050.
Seasonal storage technologies become “especially important” for 100% clean energy systems, for storing excess generation in the spring and fall and shifting energy supply to the summer and winter. More than 400 GW of seasonal storage capacity, such as combustion turbines fueled by renewably derived hydrogen, would be needed for 100% clean energy.
The report concludes by listing remaining uncertainties that “could alter the trajectories for storage growth and evolution.” The report briefly describes each of the six previous NREL studies on which it is based.
