You’ve got a contractor, you found your solar panels and inverter, you understand the taxes, you’ve got the project priced, and you’re ready to take care of your solar power plant for the long haul. How’s that for a Solar 101?
The next question is, where’s the money going to come from to pay for all this?
For most things we buy, this is an easy answer: Cold, hard cash. However, the out-of-pocket cost for a solar power system is pretty high, so the purchase is a lot like buying a car. And because solar panels pay dividends, a better analogy might be investing in a financial product.
The key is, your solar power plant is going to generate a commodity — electricity — which has a value that can be readily determined. And because of electricity’s highly quantifiable nature, many banks and other financial parties have an interest in being part of your solar power project. Even so, cash is king.

In “Italian protocol for massive solar integration: From solar imbalance regulation to firm 24/365 solar generation,” the researchers note that the PV plants should all be equipped with battery energy storage systems (BESS) and should be optimally oversized. They claim that their proposed baseline scenario would also bring down electricity costs without having any major environmental impact on agricultural land.
They said a storage/curtailment strategy could allow solar to “meet any load profiles as reliably as the thermoelectric plants used today,” with existing technologies (BESS, smart inverters, and remote control) and without a change in electrical grid architecture. The only condition would be that BESS/smart inverter-equipped PV plants should be centrally controlled by the country's grid operator and managed by power distributors or aggregators.
The researchers believe that the centralized management of a flexible PV fleet could be an optimal solution for Italy. Their findings are in clear opposition to the current self-consumption trend, under which system management occurs at the end-user level, without a large-scale perspective.
Under their proposed configuration, the final energy mix for 2060 would require 130 GW of PV, 50 GW of wind, 23.9 GW of other renewables, and just 7.98 GW of gas – down significantly from the current levels of 41 GW. Their scenario is based on the objectives of the Italian energy strategy (PNIEC) for 30 GW of solar by 2025 and 62 GW by 2030. By 2030, roughly one-quarter of the PV plants should be flexible, they argued.
Their 2060 scenario would require flexible PV plants to cover a maximum of 0.85% of Italy's land surface. By 2060, they expect that utility-scale PV and batteries should cost no more than €350 per megawatt and €90 per kilowatt-hour.
The research group includes scientists from Eurac, an Italian research institute.

To this end, the ‘Divina' project, co-ordinated by Snam, RINA and Bormioli, aims to reduce emissions in the glass melting stage, which accounts for more than 50% of total energy consumption throughout the production process,” reads a note released today.
Italian technology provider Saipem has announced a product for the generation of green hydrogen which combines renewable energy sources into a single system. “The aim is to power, together or individually, electrolyzers installed on existing offshore platforms for the production of green hydrogen. The technology responds to the growing demand for green hydrogen production and, at the same time, it allows the conversion of oil and gas offshore facilities which have now reached the end of their life cycle. The oxygen resulting from this process can be used in various areas, such as aquaculture or seaweed production,” read a note released yesterday. The company aims to apply its process to the offshore energy center Saipem, together with renewable energy company QINT’X, wants to build off the Adriatic coast of Ravenna.
German energy company Uniper has signed a cooperation agreement with Omani green hydrogen project Hyport. “Under the cooperation, Uniper will be joining the project team to provide engineering services and negotiate an exclusive offtake agreement of green ammonia,” read a note published yesterday. Hyport this year secured its 150km² renewables generation site in the special economic zone at Duqm, in Oman. The first phase of the project includes a 250-500 MW green hydrogen facility which is planned to come online in 2026. “One way of achieving this is to import green ammonia and convert it into hydrogen, which is something we are looking at for Wilhelmshaven, on Germany's North Sea coast. Germany will be heavily dependent on imports if we want to use hydrogen to help us achieve our climate goals,” said Uniper chief commercial officer Niek den Hollander.
British energy company BP and German offshore wind developer EnBW have submitted their bid for offshore wind acreage in the ScotWind leasing round. “We want to harness the clean power from Scotland’s offshore wind and use our capabilities as an integrated energy company to accelerate the country’s EV charging network, build its hydrogen offering and strengthen its supporting infrastructure, including ports and harbors,” read a note released yesterday. The partners this year entered the U.K.’s offshore wind power sector through a 50-50 joint venture to develop and operate two leases in the Irish Sea with a combined potential generation capacity of 3 GW.
Californian technology developer NewHydrogen has said it expects “tremendous” revenue generation opportunities for its hydrogen solutions, which use inexpensive, abundant materials in electrolyzers. “NewHydrogen has made significant progress towards its goal of developing technologies that lower the cost of producing green hydrogen, accelerating the timeline for large scale applications in high growth markets,” Spencer Hall, NewHydrogen’s chief operating officer, said in a note yesterday.
Icelandic flag carrier Icelandair has signed two letters of intent to decarbonize flying, including one with Universal Hydrogen, a company that has designed a hydrogen conversion kit for regional aircraft. The European Commission’s Fit for 55 policy package, unveiled last week, is likely to create momentum in the aviation sector to explore opportunities stemming from hydrogen. “We … will now start an in-depth analysis with Universal Hydrogen. At the same time, we will start discussions with other stakeholders, such as electricity and hydrogen producers, transport companies and airport operators,” read a note published last week by Icelandair.
France’s TotalEnergies has joined Austria’s OMV, Anglo-Dutch business Shell New Energies, Sweden’s Volvo Group, Italy’s IVECO and Germany’s Daimler Truck in the H2Accelerate initiative. The group collaborates to accelerate the use of hydrogen as a fuel for heavy duty road transport in Europe. H2Accelerate last week published the Need for hydrogen trucking white paper. “The publication of the first H2Accelerate white paper shows the unification of companies of significant scale and influence behind the vital importance of hydrogen in both sustainable energy systems and in long-haul trucking,” said group spokesperson Ben Madden. Road transport is another sector European institutions want to decarbonize to hit their 2030 and 2050 climate targets.

According to Linyang’s statement, the renewables projects will be integrated with local industry and will include fishpond aquaculture and agriculture. The company wants to invest around RMB10.8 billion (US$1.67 billion) in the project, which is scheduled for completion within four years. It also announced a plan to invest RMB900 million, (USD$140 million), in a 2.5 GW solar module factory in the same area as the clean power complex.
Module maker Jolywood has started construction of its new solar cell factory in Taiyuan City, Shanxi province. The 16 GW manufacturing facility will produce TOPCon solar cells and its first, 8 GW phase is expected to be completed within 24 months. Jolywood signed the agreement for the project with the government of Taiyuan in May. At end of 2020, the company had an n-type TOPCon cell capacity of 2.1 GW and module capacity of 2.7 GW, according to its finance report.
Wafer producer Zhonghuan Semiconductor has released its latest wafer prices for M6 (166mm/223mm) products, with all prices reduced by RMB0.18 per piece (US$0.028). The new price for pieces with a thickness of 170μm is RMB4.54 (US$0.70), for 165μm wafers it is RMB4.49 (US$0.692), and for 160μm, RMB4.44 (US$0.684), effective since Saturday. Lower inventory levels for Zhonghuan's G1 wafers – for which production has been scaled back – and for its popular G12 products, have ensured their price has not been altered.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/20/new-tech-may-bring-heterojunction-solar-cells-based-on-p-type-wafers-closer-to-mass-production/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,RUSSIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 20, 2021",New tech may bring heterojunction solar cells based on p-type wafers closer to mass production,"A group of scientists from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia and Russian heterojunction solar module producer Hevel Solar has developed a novel hydrogenation process that is claimed to have the potential to improve the stabilized efficiency of p-type heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell based on gallium-doped silicon wafers.
The solar industry usually applies n-type phosphorus–doped Czochralski–grown silicon (Cz–Si) wafers in the production of SHJ cells, as these ensure no susceptibility to the boron-oxygen light-induced degradation (B-O LID) that is typical for p-type boron-doped wafers and severely affects the performance of SHJ cells over time. N-type wafers ensure more stability, however, they are currently more expensive to produce than p-type wafers, which are the mainstream solution for the manufacturing of PERC cells. This means that using p-type wafers may potentially lead to a further cost reduction for the heterojunction technology, as wafer costs still represent 40% of a cell's total cost.
In order to compete with n-type devices, however, p-type heterojunction cells will have to show improved performance. “The same advanced hydrogenation techniques (AHTs) we use in mass production for solving LID and LeTID in p-type PERC solar cells can be used in p-type SHJ solar cells to solve B-O LID when using boron-doped p-type Cz wafers,” research co-author, Brett Hallam, told pv magazine. “Even though the gallium-doped and n-type SHJ solar cells were stable in this work and didn't need the process to improve stability, we have shown that these same processes can improve the efficiency of gallium-doped and n-type SHJ solar cells by 0.4-0.7% absolute.”
The research group explained that the expiration of Shin Etsu‘s gallium doping patent (US6815605B1) has encouraged the solar industry to adopt p-type gallium-doped Cz-Si wafers, which it describes as a potential mainstream solution for the SHJ segment for the next decade.
Two solar cells were developed with a new advanced hydrogenation process (AHP) at an existing SHJ line operated by Hevel using 156.75x156.75 mm p-type wafers doped with boron (B) and gallium (Ga), respectively. The first products were provided by Chinese manufacturer Longi and the second by Taiwanese wafer maker Sino-American Silicon (SAS). The scientists also built a standard n-type SHJ device as a reference.
All the wafers were initially treated with a potassium hydroxide (KOH) saw-damage etch and KOH anisotropic texturing. B-doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layers were deposited in the rear side of the wafers and intrinsic and P-doped a-Si:H layers were then deposited in the front of the wafers using a plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD). In the final step, indium-tin tin-oxide (ITO) transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers were deposited on both sides through physical vapour deposition.
According to the scientists, the cell built with B-doped wafers exhibited an efficiency of 20.5% and an open-circuit voltage of 719.6 mV, while the Ga-doped device was found to have an efficiency of 22.6%, a fill factor of 78.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 730 mV and no degradation during light-soaking. “The conversion efficiency of the gallium-doped SHJ solar cells is still lower than the n-type reference cells, which was largely due to a reduced fill factor (FF),” the Russian-Australian group affirmed. “Further work is required to overcome this FF limitation to facilitate high-efficiency gallium-doped SHJ solar cells.”
“We've demonstrated this versatile process with a number of n-type SHJ solar cell manufacturers and there are commercial tools available for this, which are already being implemented in production for industrial n-type SHJ solar cells,” Hallam stated, referring to the immediate applicability of this process to industrial production. “We would likely need to do more work on understanding the exact requirements for different SHJ solar cell manufacturers with different toolsets and processing conditions.”
A cost assessment must still be carried out. “The costs would be the same as for methods solving LID/LeTID in p-type PERC cells and when advanced hydrogenation tools are implemented for industrial n-type SHJ solar cells and TOPCon solar cells,” the UNSW researcher stated.
The solar cell and the related hydrogenation process are presented in the paper Stability Study of Silicon Heterojunction Solar cells fabricated with Gallium- and Boron-doped Silicon Wafers, published in RRL Solar.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/20/bangladeshs-upper-court-tells-government-to-get-serious-about-renewables/,"LEGAL,MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,BANGLADESH",SYFUL ISLAM,"JULY 20, 2021",Bangladesh’s upper court tells government to get serious about renewables,"The High Court of Bangladesh has responded to a petition seeking to protect the country's wetland habitats by calling on the government to prepare a masterplan to make the nation 100% powered by renewables.
Citing the example set by Germany in raising the proportion of renewable energy generation in its national power mix, the court said Dhaka should formulate a renewable energy act and establish a renewables ministry and a renewable energy commission, to expedite clean power generation.
The court issued the directives as it responded to a writ petition filed by the Bangladesh Environment Lawyers Association (BELA) which successfully sought an order to save Bangladeshi wetlands.
Solar PV could disrupt the fossil fuel industry and help with two of the biggest sustainability challenges of our times: biodiversity loss and food production. pv magazine’s UP initiative has this year shone a spotlight on agrivoltaics. Read our coverage here.
“Presently … fossil fuel is considered as very harmful for climate,” said the high court in its verdict on the BELA petition. “The developed world has stopped using fossil fuel [sic] and engaged in generation of renewable energy as an alternative.”
The Bangladeshi renewables industry applauded the court’s observation and said clean power lacked impetus because it had not received enough promotion by the government.
Responsibility for clean power deployment currently sits with Bangladesh's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, which still overwhelmingly focuses on conventional, fossil fuel power generation, according to renewables-industry professionals.
“We have long been demanding to establish a separate ministry to promote [the] renewable energy sector,” said Dipal C Barua, president of the Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association, in response to one of the points raised by the court, and he added, the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority wing of the power ministry was not sufficient to drive the nation's energy transition.
Barua lauded a recent government decision to remove permission for ten coal-fired power plants and welcomed an ambition, announced by the power minister, for the country to generate 40% of its electricity from renewables by 2041.
The issue has gained added attention as Bangladeshi is currently chairing the Climate Vulnerable Forum of 48 nations disproportionately affected by global heating.
Bangladesh's current five-year-plan – its eighth, which started this year – has also pledged aggressive funding and policy support for renewables.
At present, around 3% of Bangladesh's energy generation capacity is accounted for by its 766.49 MW of clean energy project capacity.

Legendre Energie, a subsidiary of the French group Legendre, has signed a 25-year concession agreement with the Malian Ministry of Economy and Finance for the construction of a 50 MW solar park in Fana, in western Mali's Koulikoro region.
Construction on the facility is planned to start next year, with the start of commercial operations being planned for 2023.
The plant is expected to generate 87 GWh per year of electricity and to feed the network of the country's state-owned utility, Electricité du Mali (EDM).
The power plant will be connected through the Fana (150 kV) substation located 1.3km from the project site. For the construction and operation of the park, Legendre Energie has set up the special purpose vehicle Fana Solar Power.
The investment in the project will reach approximately €50 million. According to Alousséni Sanou, minister of economy and finance of Mali, the implementation of the project “will help to cope with the ever-increasing demand for electricity, by increasing the electricity production capacity of the interconnected national grid.”
Mali had reached an installed PV power of 70 MW at the end of 2020, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Most of this capacity is represented by a 50 MW plant built by French independent power producer Akuo.

The Global Investors Move Into Renewable Infrastructure report published on Monday by Cleveland-based thinktank the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) revealed the expansion plans outlined for the 831 MW project, as announced by developer Xuan Thien Group.
Chinese panel supplier Longi Solar announced the 273 MW first phase of the VND20 trillion ($869 million) project had been completed five months ahead of schedule in November, after construction had started in April last year.
Pick up your copy of pv magazine today for an in-depth look at solar’s vital role in securing energy supply where conventional grids have struggled to reach. And don’t miss our In Conversation special: Over the past month, we have been in touch with leading researchers working on energy systems, solar cell technologies, battery storage, hydrogen and more; discussing the future of energy and the technologies we can expect to see a whole lot more of in the coming years.
The insight into the Dak Lak mega project was included in a report which highlighted ten “globally significant” renewables infrastructure projects of 2020 as well as examining the ten best performing commercial banks which lent to energy transition projects and a selected group of 25 equity investors which IEEFA feels are leading the way in clean energy commitments.
The section devoted to 2020 renewables projects also revealed the then-world-record low price for solar of $0.0135/kWh produced by the 2 GW Al Dhafra solar project near Abu Dhabi, announced in July last year, has subsequently fallen even further, thanks to cheap finance costs and currency hedging, to hit $0.0132/kWh. The original Al Dhafra tariff was undershot by the $0.0104/kWh agreed for the 600 MW Al Shuaiba project in Saudi Arabia, which was announced in April.
The 900 MW, $400 million Phalodi-Pokhran project being planned by the SB Energy developer owned by Indian conglomerate Adani Group in Rajasthan was also noted by IEEFA, as well as the 26 GW Asian Renewable Energy Hub project in Pilbara, Australia, which has hit environmental permitting trouble; LS Power's 25 MW/25 MWh Gateway Energy Storage, lithium-ion battery project in San Diego County; and the 3.6 GW pumped hydro storage plant being planned in Hubei province, China, which would supplant the 3 GW/24 GWh facility in Bath County, Virginia, in the U.S., as the world's biggest such asset.
While reporting a 9% rise in energy transition investment last year, to $501 billion, according to data provided by analyst BloombergNEF, the IEEFA study indicated the renewable energy generation capacity proportion of that total, at $303 billion, had risen only 2% from 2019, as investment in other areas such as e-mobility, green hydrogen, energy storage and heat pumps gathered pace. Solar accounted for $147 billion of the energy transition backing recorded by the study for 2020.
The document reported all of the $9 billion of debt and equity investment in energy transition projects in Brazil last year went to renewables generation capacity, which also accounted for the major spend seen in China (which attracted $135 billion in energy transition debt and equity investment), the U.S. ($85 billion), Japan ($27 billion), the U.K. ($26 billion), the Netherlands ($19 billion), and Spain ($13 billion). In Germany (which attracted an energy transition total of $29 billion in debt and equity), France ($20 billion) and Norway ($9 billion), however, investment in electric mobility and charging infrastructure – including electric vehicle purchases – accounted for a bigger slice than renewables capacity. The report also noted a 20% annual fall in such funding commitments in the U.S., to $49 billion.
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp led the energy-transition-lending commercial bank ranking compiled by IEEFA from the BloombergNEF Clean Energy League Table 2020, by offering an estimated $4.25 billion of such finance in 2020, and was one of three Japanese institutions among an otherwise European top 10, with U.S. lenders notable by their absence.
With French lender Credit Agricole Group ninth on that list, having loaned an estimated $1.89 billion, another member of the group, the Amundi Asset Management entity, was among the equity investors selectively highlighted for praise in the IEEFA report.

The agency revealed it allocated all the 2,050 MW it planned to assign through the procurement exercise, and that the final average price was KRW136.128 per kWh ($0.118), which was lower by KRW7.5, compared to that of the previous tender of the same kind.
PV projects ranging in size from 100 kW to 500 kW had the largest share of assigned capacity, by securing 639 MW, followed by installations with output between 500 kW to 1 MW, which secured 504 MW. Another 432 MW was allocated for PV systems with a capacity below 100 kW, and 274 MW was assigned to solar parks ranging in size from 1 MW to 20 MW. PV projects over 20 MW had the lowest share, at 204 MW.
The final average price for projects below 100 kW was KRW149.786, and for projects between 100 and 500 kW, KRW138.21. Installations with a capacity between 500 kW and 1 MW reached an average price of KRW132.975, and KRW134.882 was the price for projects ranging from 1 MW to 20 MW. For larger projects, the average price was not disclosed.
Overall, 7,663 projects were selected by the agency. The PV system owners will be granted the fixed rate over a 20-year period.
The exercise is the first of the two PV tenders planned for this year. There are currently no domestic content requirements embedded in the tender but, starting from this year, projects relying on solar PV modules with a low carbon footprint are being prioritized.
In the two tenders held in 2020, the KEA allocated 1.2 GW and 1.41 GW while in 2019, it contracted 350 MW and 500 MW. In 2017 and 2018, total allocated capacity was 600 MW in each year. Overall, South Korea‘s authorities should tender 4 GW of solar this year.
The country reached an installed solar power capacity of around 15.6 GW as of the end of December 2020. The newly installed PV capacity for 2020 was around 4.1 GW.
South Korea currently plans to install 30.8 GW of solar by 2030.

Ecuador’s Ministry of Energy and Non-Renewable Natural Resources has announced a new tender for the development of PV, wind and biomass projects, as well as small hydroelectric plants, in several provinces throughout the country. To do this, it has increased the national renewables target from 200 MW to 500 MW.
“For the bidding and construction of the projects considered in this block, the aim is to attract private investment of around $300 million. The realization of this electrical infrastructure will allow an additional supply of renewable energy to supply the country's electricity demand,” said Minister Juan Carlos Bermeo Calderon, without releasing any additional details.
Vice Minister Gabriel Arguello offered a virtual presentation at a recent press event on distributed generation in Ecuador. He said that the country is working in support of the energy transition.
The Ecuadorean authorities held an initial 200 MW PV tender in 2019 and 2020. The winner was Spanish PV developer Solarpack.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the Latin American country had only installed 28 MW of PV capacity by the end of 2020. Over the past seven years, it has deployed just 2 MW of PV.

Compressed air energy storage (CAES) is not much talked about in Australia, but perhaps that is about to change. A new CAES system from South Africa-based Leaper Innovate Green Energies (LIGE) – introduced to Australia by Queensland-based Essential Water and Energy Services – is unlocking the potential of CAES as a scalable energy storage system for clean intermittent sources with a long lifespan and low-cost. 
CAES is not a new technology, of course. The first system (290 MW) was installed at Huntorf, Germany, in 1978 and is still in operation today. In 1988, the Alabama Electric Cooperative’s 110 MW CAES plant also began operations in North America. CAES has become a more feasible solution in the last year and several large-scale projects have been announced in the United States, Israel and Canada.
The LIGE is a zero-emissions air battery that can be linked to the grid or a renewable energy source to provide clean energy and even clean water. According to Essential Water and Energy Services’s managing director, Geoff Hill, “a 1 MW air battery can produce up to 5,000 liters of water a day in humid conditions. The amount of water produced varies depending on the humidity of the air, also no rare earth metals are used and all parts can be recycled.” That 1 MW system could be housed in a single 12-meter container and would require a 225 kW solar system to recharge 1 MWh of stored energy. 


With a 30-year lifespan and a range between 40 kWh and 50 MWh in either three-phase 380 VAC 700A or 750 VDC 500A, LIGE air batteries are now being manufactured in Australia. 
“All major regions in the world have access to respective underground geological resources,” said Christian Breyer, professor of solar economy at the Lappeenranta University of Technology in Finland. “But there are also vast regions without a suitable potential, at least according to our analysis.” 
Breyer’s recent study of CAES with fellow researcher Arman Aghahosseini found that the storage technology is best suited to countries and regions that have little or no interconnection with their neighbours. “The more nationally a highly renewable energy system is designed,” Breyer told pv magazine, “the more relevant CAES becomes.” 
Breyer believes that CAES may become crucial in the weekly storage zone, rather than as a mainstream or seasonal storage solution. And although the study found that North America (particularly Western Canada) and sub-Saharan Africa were the best suited regions for CAES, Australia also has a decent spread of the right geological conditions (see below image). 

Hill says the growing need for scalable energy storage systems in the energy transition means that CAES and particularly the LIGE technology “may challenge lithium-ion’s dominant energy storage position.”

Surging demand for renewable energy from public and private entities – combined with rising development costs and structural entry barriers for new projects – put upward pressure on power purchase agreement (PPA) prices in the second quarter, according to LevelTen Energy, a provider of renewable energy transaction infrastructure.
The company's PPA Price Index rose by 4.3% from between the first and second quarters, and 14.4% year on year. It said that solar PPA prices have risen steadily since the beginning of 2020. Prices eased a bit in the most recent quarter, as solar PPA prices rose 0.3% quarter over quarter. Between the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of this year, solar PPA prices rose 2.6%.
The company's index for solar prices rose 0.3% to $31.45 per MWh in the second quarter. Year over year, the index rose 9.8%, or $2.80 per MWh.
LevelTen said that a “more substantial increase” could be seen in the third quarter as developers reassess their price offers. It said that a majority of solar developers surveyed – on the order of 73% – reported that they were increasing PPA prices to meet the rising cost of polysilicon and solar modules.
Despite PPA price increases, the pace of project development will likely continue, the company said. Around 12% of developer respondents said they were delaying projects, but none of the respondents said they are planning fewer projects.
LevelTen’s solar index prices ranged from $27.20 in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) to $35.90 in PJM in the mid-Atlantic. ERCOT solar prices have risen nearly 10% since the second quarter of 2020, driven by steady quarterly increases in pricing at ERCOT’s North, South, and Houston settlement hubs, said LevelTen.
Despite the increases, ERCOT remains the most competitive solar market in the United States, as abundant land, a unique market structure, and high insolation provide a favorable environment for solar development.
Solar prices in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) region fell during the second quarter, down 4.5% from the first quarter. Price volatility was due to a lower volume of solar PPA offers compared to other markets. And although CAISO has been an active region for renewables, it is not a leading market for offsite commercial and industrial procurement.
Supply chain shifts
U.S. sanctions against Chinese companies for allegedly violating human rights could add pressure to an already constrained solar supply chain, LevelTen said. It said that developers, construction companies, and module suppliers are shifting their supply chains to meet high demand for solar, while also avoiding “problematic suppliers.” The company said it expects PPA prices to stabilize as new supply chains emerge.
LevelTen said it does not expect rising PPA prices to soften demand in 2021. It said that boards of directors, investors, governments, employees, and consumers will continue to push for sustainability commitments that will require all large energy consumers to turn toward renewables.
And as awareness of alleged human rights issues grows, it said that developers “will come under increasing pressure” from stakeholders to ensure that materials for their projects are ethically sourced. It said that 68% of developer respondents said they are working to improve their practices and tracking related to social and environmental justice as a direct result of buyer preferences.
One-third of the survey respondents said that they were asked directly during the PPA proposal process to disclose human rights protections throughout their supply chains. LevelTen said that the percentage will likely increase as awareness grows. It said that renewable developers are “closely examining their sourcing practice,” and will increasingly choose to work with upstream producers that are transparent in their operations, with human rights protections in place.
