“They feature a very high cycle life of up to 20,000 cycles (LTO), or up to 8,000 cycles (G/NMC) – allowing for significant reductions in [the] total cost of ownership and making them ideal for commercial applications,” the company said, referring to the new product generation. “The modules are designed for a wide range of current and voltage outputs, going all the way up to 800 A [of] continuous current and for battery system voltages of up to 1,200 V, with [their] functionally safe battery management system.”
The battery modules will be produced through a new production line with a capacity of 500 MWh, which corresponds to approximately 60,000 modules per year. The line was provided by Italian industrial automation company Comau Spa, which is part of automaker Stellantis. It is claimed to be designed to host more capacity if the business will grow, the company said.
The new products will be used in transport applications such as marine, commercial vehicle and railway. The modules are compatible with the full range of Leclanché cells.

The Antananarivo-based business, which operates in the real estate, telecoms and finance, as well as energy sectors, said it will start work on a €17 million project to double the scale of the site this month, with commissioning of the expanded facility expected this year.
The Ambatolampy project is held by the Greenyellow Madagascar joint venture established by Axian and 49% owned by electricity company Greenyellow, which is ultimately controlled by Paris-based investment business La Foncière Euris.
The development was announced by Axian and published on the website of the Africa Solar Industry Association website today. Axian and Malagasy electricity and water utility Jiro sy rano malagasy (Jirama) said the expanded site will also feature 5 MWh of battery storage capacity.
The finance partners who backed the initial 20 MWp project have committed to support expansion of the solar plant, according to Axian. The returning backers are French lender Société Générale; the Private Infrastructure Development Group funded by the International Finance Corp private-sector arm of the World Bank alongside the governments of the U.K., the Netherlands, Switzerland, Australia, Sweden, and Germany; and the African Development Bank‘s African Guarantee Fund.
Malagasy lenders Banque de Madagascar et de l'Ocean Indien and BNI Madagascar will also continue to support the project.

The letter complained that the agency has been slow in following up on forced labor allegations and “has yet to take a single enforcement action.” The letter said that customs officials had received allegations in late 2020 and suggested “imminent enforcement action” three months ago. “We believe it is time to act,” the letter said.
The letter said that enough evidence exists to trigger action under Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. §1307). It called on the customs agency to take “strong action.” Section 307 bars the importation of goods made by convict labor or forced labor.

Switzerland-based heterojunction module manufacturer Meyer Burger has secured €125 million financing from a consortium led by German lender Ostsächsische Sparkasse Dresden. In addition, it has obtained €60 million with an, unnamed, German specialist bank for working capital financing. This means that a total of €185 million are available for expanding the company's production capacity.
By the end of 2022, the company wants to increase its solar cell production capacity in Bitterfeld from 400 MW today to 1.4 GW. In Freiberg, a total module capacity of 1 GW is expected to be reached by the end of next year, from 400 MW. Both plants, in eastern Germany, went into operation only a few weeks ago.
In addition, Meyer Burger has announced that it will set up a second module production facility with an annual capacity of 400 MW at another unspecified location by the end of 2022. This manufacturing facility will be designed for the production of panels for large scale solar plants. However, the company emphasizes that it should have the flexibility to also produce modules for distributed generation in accordance with market demand. Meyer Burger plans to launch glass-film modules and bifacial, glass-glass modules with a module output of up to 570 W and an efficiency of up to 22.9%, in 2022.
For this module capacity, Meyer Burger needs all the solar cells it produces for itself and, as a result, it will no longer sell any of its heterojunction cells to other module manufacturers in the future. The company plans to increase both cell and module production capacity to 5 GW by 2026, and to 7 GW by 2027. This will also require the construction of new production sites.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/16/demand-policies-investment-key-to-green-hydrogen-development/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA,SWITZERLAND",BLAKE MATICH,"JUNE 16, 2021","Demand, policies, investment key to green hydrogen development","pv magazine: Your research focuses on the different flexibility options to support the integration of renewable energy. How important is the development of green hydrogen for the energy transition?
Ruchi Gupta: Yes, my research focuses on different flexibility options such as energy storage technologies, grid reinforcement and sector coupling, among others, to support the integration of renewable energy and other low-carbon technologies. Renewable electricity allows the decarbonization of the power sector. However, the decarbonization of other hard-to-abate sectors, such as carbon-intensive industries and long-distance transport, still remains a big challenge. This is where sector coupling – i.e., production of green hydrogen through surplus renewable electricity by electrolysis – can play an important role in achieving the net-zero target.
You’re currently working on assessing the potential of green hydrogen in Switzerland using GIS. Can you talk more about the project?
The project on assessing the potential of green hydrogen in Switzerland is a collaborative project of the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA). In this project, we developed a detailed spatio-temporal assessment model to assess the techno-economic potential of power to gas plants (PtG) by evaluating their levelized cost of energy and value, considering their proximity to the different supply and demand centres. We also analyzed various deployment strategies and set cost improvement targets to inform investors, project developers and policymakers about optimal locations or hotspots for the placement of PtG plants.
What’s the biggest obstacle to green hydrogen development in Switzerland?
I think one of the biggest obstacles to green hydrogen development in Switzerland is the cost of solar and wind electricity, since solar installations are limited to rooftops (due to the high land costs) and wind energy faces limited public acceptance. The cost levels in Switzerland are in general higher compared to other countries due to the higher labour costs. For example, the total installation cost of residential PV in Switzerland is almost double compared to India. Other driving factors for the high costs of renewable energy in Switzerland are the long duration of proceedings as well as demanding requirements for the environmental impact assessment.
How do you see the green hydrogen economy currently? Will it be a case of countries like Saudi Arabia and Australia becoming export superpowers because of their solar advantage compared to countries in say, North-east Asia and Europe?
It is correct that countries like Saudi Arabia and Australia have a solar advantage, however, there are other issues that need to be addressed. One of them is transportation and storage as a fully-fledged hydrogen infrastructure is still lacking. Having said that, if the opportunities are timely seized, it will surely create new export opportunities for countries with rich renewable energy sources.

You were previously part of a team that contributed to India’s National Energy Policy – do you think India’s solar resources will make it a big player in the future green hydrogen economy?
Yes, indeed. The price of the delivered power is the biggest driver of the cost of green hydrogen. The recent lowest bid of $ 0.027/kWh for solar and a competitive wind tariff gives India a competitive advantage to disrupt the green hydrogen economy. Considering India’s falling solar and wind electricity costs and increasing deployment targets of 450 GW by 2030, if the right and timely policies are adopted, India has the potential to become a net exporter of green hydrogen by 2030. India is also planning to promote local large-scale manufacturing of electrolyzers. As per Niti Aayog, domestic electrolyzers production and development of green hydrogen projects could create a new green technology market of around $18 billion to $20 billion in India along with domestic job creation.
What do you see as the biggest challenge to the development of green hydrogen?
I think the biggest challenge right now is the cost of green hydrogen, which is still not competitive compared to grey hydrogen. However, with the decreasing renewable electricity and electrolyzer costs, green hydrogen will reach par or even cheaper in the future.
One element I would like to emphasize is that we should not only assess the cost, but also the value generated by green hydrogen. For example, oxygen and heat produced as by-products from the process of electrolysis can be sold in the market to generate revenue. In addition, power-to-hydrogen systems can provide other stacked benefits such as frequency control, avoided CO2 taxes and the sale of surplus renewable electricity to the grid. The world is going to pay a premium for carbon free products and that will increase the value generated by green hydrogen. Off course in order to achieve that, we need to unlock demand, and that requires having the appropriate policies in place for market creation and a progressive and stable regulatory framework.
What do you see as the biggest opportunity of green hydrogen?
Until now, green hydrogen is not seen as a profitable investment due to its high production costs compared to grey hydrogen. However, decreasing cost of renewable electricity generation due to economies of scale, offers a unique opportunity for cost competitive green hydrogen production.
What’s next for green hydrogen?
I think exciting times are ahead as we will see something similar to what we saw in the case of solar PV, with dramatic cost reductions and vast deployment that outperformed all previous forecasts. In the coming years, we will also see the first large-scale green hydrogen production facilities entering into operation. Demand creation, right policies and timely investments will be the key for the successful development of a green hydrogen economy.

IRENA announced the agreement on its website yesterday and said the partners would work with nations hosting UN peacekeeping missions to install clean energy capacity wherever possible.
As part of the deal, IRENA has also pledged to help attract financial backing from private investors for such efforts.
The Abu Dhabi-based energy body said the deployment of renewables would boost the clean energy capacity of nations hosting peacekeeping operations as well as reducing the carbon footprint of the UN.
“Our six-year (2017-2023) environment strategy is transforming our operations in peacekeeping missions,” said Atul Khare, UN under-secretary-general for operational support, quoted in the IRENA statement. “Our focus on raising awareness, improving performance, and reducing our environmental footprint has prompted peacekeeping missions to implement more renewable energy projects. Several renewable energy projects are already under way in the field missions and we are keen to look for new and innovative ways to outsource renewable energy supply and to implement on-site renewable solutions.”

“The solar array will have a power of around 70 kW and will power the main municipal buildings and some parks located nearby,” the town's mayor, Marco Bongiovanni, told pv magazine. “We have also installed solar installations on other surfaces but the project on the bridge has, for us, a particular value, as it is based on a series of innovative features.”
He also explained that the remaining rooftop surfaces available for PV systems in the town are all located in landscape protection areas adjacent to historic building the Pulcherada Abbey, and the deployment of the panels on these roofs would have compromised the landscape that the municipal administration wants to safeguard.
The bridge system will be south-oriented and will be built at a cost of around €160,000 with special mounting structures that will connect the solar panels to one of the bridge's sides. “It will not be like a conventional solar facade, and will have an inclination designed to receive both sunlight and water glare, which will help increase the power yield of the system,” he further explained. “It will have a sort of vertical orientation that is not homogeneous, so that it looks like a book.”
According to him, the mounting structures have the ability to orient each individual panel in a different way, both on the vertical and horizontal axes, which allows obtaining an optimization of the performance and an aesthetically pleasing configuration. The panels will have an inclination of 80 degrees.
The PV system will be deployed along the entire length of the bridge, which measures around 300m, and will inject surplus power into the Italian grid under the country's net metering scheme, the so-called Scambio sul posto. “We will use full-black solar modules to mitigate the landscape impact of the solar array,” Bongiovanni further explained. “Furthermore, the project's power electronics and the inverters will be designed in a way that power yield is maximized.”
The installation will rely on 220 solar panels with a power output of 320 W and a maximum system voltage of 1,000 V. “They are not particularly more expensive, but have a better aesthetic result,” the mayor stated. “The manufacturer has not been identified yet.”

Veleta BidCo Sàrl, a special purpose company indirectly wholly owned by the Swedish venture capital fund EQT Infrastructure V, has announced a takeover bid for 100% of Solarpack‘s share capital.
Before the announcement was made, Beraunberri, SL, Landa LLC and Burgest 2007, SL, Solarpack's main shareholders, which jointly own 50.957% of the company, signed an agreement with the bidder by virtue of which they agree to sell their entire stake within the framework of the takeover bid.
EQT offers €26.50 in cash per share, which represents a total price of €881.2 million and represents a premium of approximately 45% over the closing price of the company's shares on June 15, 2021 (€18.28) and 35.1% of the weighted average price, by volume, of the company's shares during the three-month period ending June 15, 2021 (€19.62), and 16.6% of the weighted average price, by volume, of the company's shares during the six-month period ending June 15, 2021 (€22.73).
The offer will be conditional on reaching a minimum acceptance level of 75% plus one share, including the shares owned by the selling shareholders, as well as receiving the approval of the Spanish antitrust authorities. The offeror intends to request the de-listing of the company's shares, subject to the applicable regulatory approval and corporate procedures.
The operation, subject to the authorization of the National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC), has been classified as “attractive” by Bankinter, a Spanish financial services company headquartered in Madrid, although it points out that it is 13% below the market consensus target price, which is €30 per share. However, this price is considerably higher than the one Iberdrola was about to pay for Solarpack in November, when the newspaper El Confidencial announced that there was an agreement between the parties for just over €600 million.
Meanwhile, Solarpack's stock price has soared 40%.
Solarpack has a global portfolio of 8.1 GW of projects under development. The company ended 2020 with a net profit of €10.4 million, which is 14.4% less than in 2019, when it posted earnings of €11.9 million.

The scientists decided to build the electrode with a hole-transporting molecule called Br-2PACz and not with commonly-used thin films based on PEDOT:PSS, which is a conjugating-based polythiophene polymer. This compound was bound to an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode to form a single-molecule layer.
The new coating was tested on an organic cell developed by the KAUST scientists and its efficiency rose from 17.5% to 18.4%. “Br-2PACz increased the cell's efficiency in several ways,” the research group explained. “Compared with its rival, it caused less electrical resistance; improved hole transport; and allowed more light to shine through to the absorbing layer.”

Moreover, the Br-2PACz also improved the structure of the light-absorbing layer itself, which the scientists attributed to the coating process. The latter is claimed, in fact, to enable the recyclability of the solar cell, as the ITO electrode can be removed from the cell's coating and be used for other applications.
The discovery of the new material for the electrode coating, according to the Saudi team, may revolutionize the research in organic solar. “We believe Br-2PACz has the potential to replace PEDOT:PSS due to its low cost and high performance,” said KAUST researcher Yuanbao Lin.

Up to May 25, the Invesco Solar ETF – an exchange-traded fund that tracks the MAC Global Solar Energy Index – underperformed relative to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial. The Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) decreased 6.4%, while the S&P 500 and DJIA increased 0.4% and 1.5%, respectively.
The five solar stocks in the U.S. market that predominantly recorded losses include Applied Materials (1.4%), Enphase Energy (1.2%), SolarEdge Technologies (-3.3%), Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure (4.1%), and Generac Holdings (-4.1%). The most pressing challenge for the solar PV industry is without a doubt the cost increases throughout the supply chain, but none are highlighted more than the increase in commodities costs, in particular steel and freight costs.
U.S. steel prices are expected to remain high through the first two quarters of 2022. U.S. manufacturers do not appear in a rush to increase production. Factors that contribute to the price increases include the consolidation of U.S. steel mills and tariffs on steel imports. Steel imports have driven the rise in U.S. steel mill utilization (now reported at 85%), and with a decline in suppliers due to consolidation, producers are able to maintain their “stranglehold” on supply and sustain high prices until the first half of 2022. Overall, price increases and a higher cost of capital have added $0.05/W of incremental costs.
Input costs
Solar tracker manufacturers such as Array (ARRY) and FTC Solar (FTCI) witnessed major hits to their stock prices (down ~50% and ~40% on May 12, respectively) during earnings season in the week of May 10. Again, this was directly attributed to cost inflation. For reference, U.S. utility-scale PV module pricing six months ago for the third quarter of 2020 was $0.25/W, compared to $0.28/W today. With mid-teen IRRs for utility-scale projects, these companies do not have much room to absorb this rapidly increasing cost inflation.

After more than a year of research and development, NanoGraf, an advanced battery materials developer, said it has hit on a chemical recipe that enables previously unattainable levels of energy density in an 18650 cylindrical lithium-ion cell.
The 18650 cell is a standardized battery form factor, used across sectors by the likes of Tesla and the U.S. Army. The energy density achievement was enabled by developing a proprietary silicon-oxide anode material that can be introduced into the same battery form factor at densities beyond what has been achieved previously, according to Kurt “Chip” Breitenkamp, vice president of business development at NanoGraf.
According to Breitenkamp, this material has enabled NanoGraf to increase battery capacity in the 18650 form factor by an initial 12%. For perspective, energy density in that form factor had increased roughly 8% over the course of the last decade, prior to NanoGraf’s work.
NanoGraf’s research was aided by funding from the U.S. Department of Defense, with the goal of developing a longer-lasting and potentially lighter per-cell lithium-ion battery, designed to provide U.S. military personnel with better portable power for the equipment they rely on. The new chemistry, however, has uses beyond military portable electronics. NanoGraf says that the biggest opportunities for more energy-dense batteries lie in electric vehicles, as the cell technology could provide an immediate boost to vehicle range.
“Range anxiety” has been a significant hurdle in mainstream EV adoption. According to NanoGraf, the new cell technology could extend the range of a Tesla Model S by up to 28% on a single charge.
According to Breitenkamp, this most recent breakthrough is just the beginning, and the company soon could see even greater density increases.
“We believe that we can put even more of this silicon material into batteries and I think we can double this,” said Breitenkamp. “I think we can get to 20% in the near future.”
The capacity achievement is not just limited to the 18650 form factor, but could be applied to other battery cells. Breitenkamp said that the 18650 form factor was chosen due to its commercial relevance and widespread usage.
In the near-term, NanoGraf’s biggest goal is to get its technology to commercial scale. Breitenkamp said that the company specifically sought out a low-cost manufacturing route with low-cost materials in order to reach cost parity with battery technologies currently dominating the market.

Higher solar module prices will likely impact the returns of solar power project developers. Module prices have increased by about 15% to 20% over the last four to five months. These price increases have mainly been driven by a sharp increase in the price of polysilicon, a key input for cell and module manufacturers. 
The hardening of PV module prices, if sustained, remains a near-term headwind, as most solar power installations in India are dependent on PV module imports. This risk is especially significant for about 4 GW of capacity won by developers over the last six to nine months at tariffs ranging between INR 2.00 ($0.027)/kWh and INR 2.25/kWh. This is leading to upward pressure on the overall capital costs for solar power projects. 
Girishkumar Kadam, senior vice president of ICRA, expects a 12 to 14 basis point impact on debt service coverage metrics for project developers. 
“Given that the PV module component comprises about 50-55% of the overall project cost, such increase in the module price level by about 4-5 cents/watt if sustained, is likely to moderate the debt service coverage metrics for the project developers by about 12 to 14 basis points,” he said. 
India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) said that solar projects under standard bidding guidelines are required to procure modules from its Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM). However, the registration of module manufacturers outside India has remained affected due to lockdown restrictions and procedural requirements. This may present near-term challenges to Indian developers in the procurement of imported PV modules.
“The uncertainty on the timelines for inclusion of module suppliers from China in the ALMM list may affect the incremental bidding activity in the solar power sector,” said Vikram V, vice president of ICRA. “Nonetheless, cumulative solar project awards as of date remain strong at around 28 GW (excluding the capacity pending for signing of power sale agreements/power purchase agreements and including hybrid projects), which provides healthy visibility on the capacity addition over the medium term.”

The U.S. solar market passed 100 GW of generating capacity in the first quarter, doubling the size of the industry over the past 3.5 years, according to the U.S. Solar Market Insight Q2 2021 report, released by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie.
The report showed that residential solar was down 8% from the fourth quarter of 2020, but up 11% from the first quarter of 2021, with 905 MW installed. The report credited “healthy sales pipelines” that spilled over into the first quarter.
Commercial solar and community solar volumes fell from the fourth quarter of 2020, as is typical for these market segments. Commercial solar rose 19% from the first quarter of 2020, while community solar fell 15%.
Utility-scale solar set a record for first-quarter installations at 3.6 GW. Texas made up the largest share of this capacity, with more than 1.4 GW of installations.
A total of 6.2 GW of new utility-scale solar power purchase agreements were announced in the first quarter of 2021, on par with the first three months of 2020. The total utility-scale contracted pipeline has grown to nearly 77 GW, the report said.
Wood Mackenzie forecasts that the solar industry will continue to break annual installation records every year for the next three years before the investment tax credit (ITC) fully phases out under current law. Another 160 GW of capacity will be installed between 2021 and 2026, bringing the total operating PV fleet to more than 250 GWdc by the end of 2026.
Texas led all states with 1.52 GW of new solar capacity in the first quarter – more than it added in all of 2019 and three times more than any other state. Indiana, Virginia, Michigan, and Iowa were among the top 10 solar states this quarter. Indiana rose from 32nd in terms of new installed solar capacity in 2020 to fourth as of the first quarter. Meanwhile, Georgia fell from seventh place to 38th over the same time period.
The report also calls attention to rising costs in the solar industry and helps to explain the dynamics at play. It said that “compounding cost increases across all materials started at the end of the first quarter and are beginning to affect installers now.”
