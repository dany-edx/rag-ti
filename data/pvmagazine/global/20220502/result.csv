France's Ecovégétal has released Héliovert, a PV system for green rooftops that combines solar power generation and urban gardening.
“The idea of exploiting the synergy between these two technologies came from a study currently being carried out by Cerema, a French public agency for developing public expertise in the fields of urban planning, in Nancy,” Pierre Georgel, the CEO and founder of the green roof specialist, told pv magazine France.
The new system is the result of several years of research under the PROOF project, which aims to assess the energy contribution of a green rooftop to the electrical efficiency of a solar panel.
“The first results show an increase in electricity production yields of 8 to 10% thanks to the presence of vegetation which acts as a thermal regulator under the photovoltaic panels,” said Georgel. “But it goes much further than putting lawn on a roof. It is indeed the vegetation that serves as ballast for the solar panel fixing system.”

In the proposed system configuration, drains known as XD20, DK20, or equivalent are laid over the entire surface of the roof and serve as an anti-root sealing system and for the retention of rainwater at a rate of 7 liters per square meter. A recycled plastic slab is installed on top.
“This slab will serve both as a water drainage basin and as fixing support for the aluminum frames inclined at 15 degrees on which the photovoltaic panels are installed,” Georgel said. “It is therefore not necessary to drill into the roof structure.”
A substrate known as Saxalis 1.1,  which is non-flammable and is based on mineral aggregates enriched with organic matter, is then spread over the roof. Finally, the company plants flowering meadow-type vegetation that can change color with the seasons. The plants are chosen for their high evapotranspiration, which lowers the temperature on the roof by several degrees, especially in hot weather.

According to Georgel, the presence of certain plants on a flat rooftop can even serve as a bulwark against the risk of fire.
“Finally, we are witnessing the return of biodiversity to the urban environment. Local fauna such as birds and pollinating insects and the reintroduction of flora adapted and resistant to its environment,” he said.
Ecovégétal chooses solar modules and its partners according to customer preferences. The panels can be oriented south or east-west, depending on the geographical area and the biodiversity. Beforehand, the thickness and the dry weight of the substrate – that is to say, the weight of the earth and the vegetation in the event of severe drought – is the subject of a study to ensure the resistance of the solar panels to the wind.
The Broue-based company's first projects include the roofing of Bosch's offices in Saint-Ouen, coordinated by Metropolis Architectes Associes. An area of 990 square meters will be planted and 790 square meters will be covered with 395 solar modules.

India's Enray Solutions has developed a self-powered, easy-to-use robot for water-free cleaning of ground-mount solar installations. The robot is built for harsh, dusty environments, and the company claims it can lead to a generation increase of up to 7% compared to periodic wet cleaning.
The robot doesn’t require any external power supply, as it is powered by an onboard monocrystalline solar panel and lithium battery with a control box. It is cloud-enabled and can sense weather to work accordingly.
An all-metallic body and aluminum components make the robot robust and lightweight at the same time. The industrial trolley-based design of the dock with height and tilt adjustment mechanism allows for the cleaning of multiple, misaligned arrays without lifting the robot. This eliminates the mishandling of the robot while shifting between arrays.
The robot easily travels without any rails and cleans itself while docking. A silicon coating on the wheels provides a cushion between it and the PV modules, preventing physical damage to the solar panels.
Cloud connectivity also allows the Enray team to centrally control and monitor the robot’s performance and update its software from time to time. The team has installed the robot for Indian clients such as Adani, NTPC, Tata Power, and Vikram Solar.

The California-based company, which also manufactures batteries, posted revenue of $441 million in the January-March window, up 7% from the $413 million recorded in the final quarter of 2021. It said it expects $490 million to $520 million worth of business in the current trading period.
Those numbers translated into net income of $51.8 million, down from $52.6 million in the previous quarter, with no obvious explanation offered in the first-quarter update published on the Enphase website. However, the company did add that its own, non-generally accepted accounting principle figure would have been $110 million, helped along by the inclusion of $47.8 million of stock-based compensation.
Enphase said it expects shift 130 MW to 140 MW of its IQ Batteries in the current quarter. It shipped around 2.84 million of its microinverters in the January-March period – down 6% on the previous quarter – for a total capacity of 1,029 MWdc, plus 120 MW worth of  IQ Batteries.
The company expects operating expenses in the current three-month period to rise to $128 million to $131 million because of a share incentive scheme and acquisition costs, which it expects will amount to $57 million.
A slashing in net interest costs for Enphase, from $12.7 million at the end of 2021 to $2.74 million at the end of March, helped the company's cash balance rise from $119 million to $252 million over the same period. At the same time, its non-current debts rose from $952 million to $1.2 billion, with the manufacturer having acquired business leads company SolarLeadFactory LLC in March.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/02/us-startup-claims-hydrogen-output-for-0-85-kg-or-less-via-new-water-vapor-electrolyzer/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"MAY 2, 2022",US startup claims hydrogen output for $0.85/kg or less via new water vapor electrolyzer,"Milwaukee-based Advanced Ionics has launched a new water vapor electrolyzer that is designed to operate in conjunction with commonly available waste or process heat from industry. The Symbiotic Electrolyzes system runs at temperatures below 650 C, and is reportedly able to produce hydrogen for $0.85/kg or less.
“This electrolyzer is the first to work across a wide range of temperatures, from 100 C to 650 C,” Chad Mason told pv magazine. “Our Symbiotic technology is a new class of electrolyzer. It is not alkaline, PEM, or Solide Oxide (SOEC).”
Alkaline, anion exchange membrane (AEM), and polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) are cold electrolyzers using liquid water. Solid oxide electrolyzers are hot electrolyzers working with heated steam, corresponding to higher efficiency. As said, the company's electrolyzer operates with temperatures in between. The idea is that temperatures in between allow for high efficiency, while also using cheaper materials for the large-scale assembly, including the stack.
The industry is currently trying to step away from platinum. Just last week, two different research teams (the first led by Imperial College London, the second by Clemson Nanomaterials Institute) presented ways to substitute the metal.
Russia is currently the second-largest platinum producer in the world, accounting for more than 15% of world production. Similarly, Advanced Ionics does not use platinum and iridium metals.
“We use common materials more regularly found in an alkaline electrolyzer, but in a unique configuration,” Mason said. 
The technology uses engineered porous metal electrodes and composite ionic materials for its electrolyte. It does not require “delicate” perfluorinated membranes or “expensive” ceramics, said Mason. Advanced Ionics did not provide any additional details about the membrane. 
Andras Perl, a scientist at EnTranCe Centre of Expertise Energy at the Hanze University of Applied Sciences, explained that the charge carrier in the membrane would be a pivotal element in understanding the future of this technology. 
“Our electrolyzer works in tandem with process and waste heat already being produced at industrial sites. By tapping into this existing energy source, we are able to dramatically reduce the electricity requirements for electrolysis, which is the dominant factor in the cost of green hydrogen production. Other electrolyzers require a minimum of 40 kWh per kilogram of hydrogen, and usually closer to 50 kWh. We can produce hydrogen for below 35 kWh, and that results in a dramatically lower cost,” Mason said, noting that this assumes that economies of scale have been achieved.
Economies of scale are now key for competing technologies. The timing of funding is also essential. Last week, Advanced Ionics announced the closure of $4.2 million of initial financing, led by Clean Energy Ventures. 
“Leveraging this new funding, Advanced Ionics will be developing a series of demonstration projects during the next year with partners before expanding to deploy larger-scale projects. In the near future, they will also build a large-scale electrolyzer manufacturing facility to serve key markets such as Europe and North America,” Mason said. 
The company is currently in negotiation with private pilot deployment partners. It expects to take commercial orders in 2024 and ship in 2025. 
“We are being very aggressive on our timelines to match the desperate need for green hydrogen supply to decarbonize all aspects of our economy,” a spokesperson told pv magazine.
Clean Energy Ventures said it is optimistic about the technology.
“After more than five years of evaluating the sector, we backed Advanced Ionics because we believe this leadership team can scale a highly competitive technology to produce the lowest-cost green hydrogen at a scale,” said Daniel Goldman, co-founder and managing partner of Clean Energy Ventures.
According to IHS Markit, the levelized cost of green hydrogen produced through electrolysis was around $4/kg  to $5/kg in 2021. Advanced Ionics claims to be able to provide clean hydrogen without the green premium, for less than $1/kg using Symbiotic steam electrolysis in many industrial locations. 
“The levelized cost of the hydrogen will depend roughly on the cost of heat, electricity, and the capital cost of the setup. If they get cheap heat, almost free electricity, and no expensive materials, then it seems feasible,” said Perl.
He noted that the results of their first demonstration projects would test the feasibility of the technology at a larger scale and in industrial environments.

“The qualification process for Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) 2 is now complete and the auction opened this morning (Friday, April 29), with final results due in mid-June,” the ministry said in a statement. “It is anticipated that RESS 2 will deliver a significant increase in the proportion of renewable generation delivered by solar – by the end of 2024.”
The Irish government explained that the new auction will not include, as in the first auction, a standalone preference category for PV. That allowed solar projects to compete on a like-for-like basis with other solar projects, rather than competing with wind, which is a well-established industry in Ireland. The ministry said this choice was due to the low competitive costs shown by solar in the first auction.
“In RESS 2 – the second scheme – the design of the auction has been modified, removing the standalone solar preference category and, instead, utilizing an evaluation correction factor (ECF),” the government said. “The ECF is intended to reflect the relative benefits that each type of technology (and the diversity that they bring) has on system costs.”
The auction announcement coincided with the commissioning of the first solar project from the first REES renewables auction, which was held in August 2020. French renewable energy developer Neoen built the 8 MW facility near Ashford in County Wicklow, in southeastern Ireland.
“This is the first of many solar projects expected to energize under the RESS this year,” said Eamon Ryan, the minister of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications. “It’s a key starting point on our journey, under the Climate Action Plan, to install up to 2.5 GW of solar energy on the electricity system by 2030.”
In the first renewables auction, the Irish authorities allocated 796 MW of generating capacity. The average weighted bid price for the technology-neutral auction was €74.08 ($78)/MWh. Project developers secure feed-in premiums to top up the wholesale power price for 14 to 16.5 years, depending on project delivery dates.

“The E series is Tesvolt’s response to the global shortage of chips in energy storage systems; the new systems are configured to use 80% fewer chips,” the manufacturer. “This allows the manufacturer to produce its battery storage system solutions in larger batches and meet the skyrocketing demand for commercial storage systems.”
The E Series includes the TS-I HV 80 battery and the TS-I HV 100 battery, with storage capacities of 80 kWh and 90 kWh, respectively. The first of the two devices has a nominal voltage of 810 V, a size of 2,008 mm x 608 mm x 990 mm, and a total weight of 656 kg. The largest storage system has the same size, a weight of 886 kg, and a nominal voltage of 972 V.
The batteries have efficiencies of up to 98% and rely on a cooling technology based on passive fins and fans. They both come with a 10-year performance guarantee and a five-year product guarantee.
The E Series also includes the TS-I HV 70 battery with a storage capacity of 72 kWh and a nominal voltage of 729 V, and the TPS-E container.
“The storage systems in the E series shave peak load,s, optimize self-consumption and supply back-up power. They function both on-grid and off-grid and are also very well suited as charging infrastructure for electric vehicles,” the manufacturer said, adding that the lithium-ion cells in the batteries are provided by South Korea's Samsung SDI. “The storage systems in the E series meet the same quality criteria as the A series, but higher energy density and an optimised design mean we can produce them in larger quantities.”

One such customer in the United States recently took delivery of an atomic layer deposition (ALD) tool from Dutch supplier SALD. According to SALD, the unnamed customer plans to use the tool in a pilot production line for perovskite solar cells.
Little else is known about the buyer or its plans for perovskite solar cell production. However, SALD CTO Erik Kremers told pv magazine that its atomic layer deposition equipment could fulfil a number of roles on such a production line.
“A typical application for ALD would be TiO2 [titanium oxide] or SnO2 [tin oxide] buffer layers inside the electron contact,” he said. “Other applications are ZnO:Al for tunnel recombination layers and transparent conductive oxides.”
The announcement makes note of the tool’s suitability for “roll to roll” processes with flexible substrate materials, but Kremers also noted that it could also be suitable for deposition on to glass, or even silicon to create a tandem cell structure.
SALD also makes mention of tin-based perovskites, which have been less researched and only achieved significantly lower performances than their lead-based counterparts. There is still interested in tin-based materials, as these avoid the use of lead which is toxic to humans and can cause problems if it finds its way out of the cell and into the environment.
“While it is possible to replace lead with tin, tin gradually oxidizes, causing the perovskite's crystalline structure to be lost,” said Kremers. “It is precisely this oxidation that is to be prevented by the use of SALD technology in order to ensure long-term stability.”

The tool consists of a glove box, and allows for cells to be processed in a nitrogen atmosphere, protecting the sensitive layers from ambient air, before the protective layer is deposited on top. It can process two M6 wafers at once, according to Kremers.
“The deposition rate is 1 nanometer per second and throughput depends on the layer thickness. A rough indication for the throughput at 10 nm layer thickness is approximately 100 wafers per hour.”
At these rates, far from the several thousand wafer per hour processed in commercial silicon cell production, it’s likely that the customer will be experimenting with different possibilities for larger-scale processing, and Kremers is also keen to point out that even at this scale, its spatial ALD technology is “easily up-scalable to high volume production with a low cost of ownership.”
Another option being investigated for likely similar functions in future perovskite cell manufacturing is physical vapor deposition (PVD), a process type already used in various functions for silicon cell manufacturing. Here though, Kremers noted several advantages for SALD’s atomic layer deposition technology.
“ALD does not induce sputter damage to the sensitive perovskite material. Moreover, it results in dense layers that are well-suited as moisture permeation barrier, which can enhance the stability of the perovskite,” he explained. “Spatial ALD in comparison to PVD processes show that for the same functionality the layers thickness is less, so less material is necessary. This benefits in lower costs per m² and higher throughput.”

Sydney-based renewables developer Maoneng said that the proposed Merriwa Energy Hub, to be built in New South Wales (NSW), will be one of the largest renewable energy hubs in Australia, with a 550 MW solar farm and a 400 MW/1,600 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS).
Maoneng CEO Morris Zhou said that the AUD 1.6 billion ($1.1 billion) energy hub has been designed to address the regional energy supply and grid stability needs of the National Electricity Market (NEM).
“This project will support the NSW government’s large-scale solar generation and battery storage strategies as the state moves towards increasing use of clean energy,” he said. “The Merriwa Energy Hub would be one of the largest renewable energy hubs in the country and, while it’s still early days, we expect the construction process to support hundreds of direct and indirect jobs, as well as significant investment into communities experiencing a shift away from fossil fuel.”
Maoneng said the solar farm will comprise about 1.3 million bifacial solar panels mounted on single-axis trackers installed across 780 hectares. The project will also involve the construction of a new substation which will connect to the NEM via TransGrid’s existing 500 kV transmission line that runs along the south of the site.
“We have deliberately chosen the site based upon its robust connection to the existing grid, making efficient use of the infrastructure that exists today,” Zhou said, adding the solar farm and battery will each have a connection into the substation. “We wanted to make the battery flexible, so it can operate independently of the solar farm. The best value for money is a battery directly connected to the network, where it can still do arbitrage but also all the other functions that the network needs.”
Maoneng said a development application for the Merriwa Energy Hub is expected to be lodged with the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment in the coming weeks. It aims to achieve financial close by December 2023, with completion of the project expected in 2025. Construction of the solar farm and battery is expected to take 18 months.
Zhou said the project has already attracted interest from infrastructure investors and construction groups. Both the solar farm and battery energy storage system will be backed by power purchase agreements.
The proposed Merriwa Energy Hub is the latest addition to Maoneng’s pipeline of renewable energy projects. The company, which retains an interest in the 200MW Sunraysia Solar Farm being developed in southwest New South Wales, is also developing the 240MW/480MWh Mornington battery project in Victoria and the 225MW/450MWh Gould Creek storage project in near Adelaide in South Australia. It also has three other standalone battery projects on the go, with 450MW/900MWh of energy storage spread between sites at Lismore, Tamworth and Armidale in regional New South Wales.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/02/ukraine-is-there-a-pessimistic-solar-scenario-no/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,EUROPE,UKRAINE",,"MAY 2, 2022",Ukraine: Is there a pessimistic solar scenario? No!,"This year, Ukraine ranked among the world's top 20 countries with the largest solar energy fleet, with a total installed capacity of 7.7 GW. Large ground-mounted solar power plants took a large share with 6.2 GW of installed capacity, while installations on commercial and residential buildings reached 1.5 GW.
Ukrainian companies had planned to build 400-500 MW worth of facilities in 2022; however, nearly all projectshave been frozen. This year, the industry can implement just a few commercial and residential self-consumption projects in the West of Ukraine. This raises questions about the future of the sector and its possible repercussions across Europe's energy landscape. Here I share my thoughts on some of these questions.
Russia's attack on Ukraine is a vast social and economic shock for Ukrainians and Europe. At the same time, it was a turning point for the further development of the energy sector. In March, the whole world watched as a Russian tank shelled Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhya. Miraculously, a man-made nuclear catastrophe did not occur. Russian troops disrupted the shelter at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant for nearly a month. Thanks only to the efforts of the station's staff and Ukrainian repair crews was it possible to prevent another Chernobyl disaster.
What would happen if a shell or an aerial bomb hit the reactor? Where are the guarantees that such a tragedy cannot occur in the future anywhere in Europe where there are nuclear power plants? There are no guarantees. And no matter how much we talk today about the benefits and strategic importance of developing nuclear energy in Europe, it is clear that every such facility is a time bomb.
Most people see the atomic war as a direct strike using ballistic missiles with a nuclear warhead. But in reality every nuclear power plant is a vast nuclear warhead that could be blown up. Let us remember this when we want to express support for atomic energy in Europe. The same is true of Europe's dependence on Russian gas and oil. This is a vast geopolitical time bomb.
Today in Ukraine, more than 60% of industrial enterprises have been destroyed or shut down, and more than 80% of businesses have closed or reduced their activities to a minimum. In the eastern part of Ukraine, entire cities have turned into ruins. As a result, the country has a massive surplus of electricity, 72% of which is produced by nuclear power plants.
Ukraine sells surplus electricity to European consumers. In early March, Ukraine joined the ENTSO-E. Accordingly, the operator of electricity purchases in the country is the Guaranteed Buyer company. According to the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine, it distributes almost all received financial resources in favor of Energoatom. Due to the war, unfortunately, green energy is not a priority in Ukraine today. At best, renewable energy companies are expected to receive no more than 15% of their earnings from electricity sales. Of course, there can be no question of any investment in this area during the war.
I would also like to point out that many European companies that own solar power plants in Ukraine have abandoned their operating facilities at random, ceasing to pay Ukrainian companies that provide service and protection of stations.
According to my estimates, during two months of war in Ukraine, about 30-40% of solar power plants have been destroyed, and this figure may increase as the fighting continues. Most of the facilities are located in the southern and central parts of Ukraine, in the Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhia, Mykolaiv, Kherson, and Odesa regions, which today are at the epicenter of heavy fighting and shelling.
But I want to emphasize one crucial fact: home solar power plants are the basis of energy security in war conditions. Due to shell damage, many Ukrainian settlements have been without electricity for several weeks. The only energy source was home solar power, which helped sustain life and save many lives.
 I am certain that in 2022, the segment of solar power plants for self consumption will continue to develop in Ukraine. We are talking about small facilities between 10-20 kW.
We estimate that about 50-100 MW of these types of systems  could be installed by year-end. Most of these projects will be implemented in the Western region of Ukraine. In addition to active hostilities in the south and east of Ukraine, a significant deterrent to solar energy development is a substantial reduction in investment opportunities, as resources aim to support the army and humanitarian projects.
I see several scenarios for the development of solar energy in Ukraine. But first, I will note that we will obviously have to say goodbye to the green tariff in Ukraine soon. The country's economy is ruined, and grants will be redirected to other industries and projects. But this will not hinder the development of solar energy.
The first scenario is optimistic. After the end of the war in Ukraine, the energy development strategy in favor of green energy, including distributed generation, will be revised, and new construction standards will be developed, including mandatory bomb shelters and independent electricity sources, solar electricity sources stations, and storage facilities.
The second scenario is moderately optimistic. The government will not support renewable energy development, but it will develop itself as an energy security tool for businesses and households. However, the government will realize that renewable energy needs to be supported over time.
Is there a pessimistic scenario? No. The future of Ukraine and Europe will be based on reducing the consumption of traditional energy resources.
Fancy a little more insights on the Ukrainian and Eastern European energy prospects? This year's Sustainable Energy Forum will take place, albeit not in Kyiv, as usual. Renewable energy experts and stakeholders from across Eastern Europe will meet for the two day conference and trade show event, in Krakow instead.
Polish energy is based on coal-fired power plants. The coal lobby in the country is vast. However, Poland has made a massive leap in developing renewable energy, including solar. In just two years, between 2019-2021, the installed capacity of solar power plants in Poland increased 10 times, from 0.6 GW to 6.1 GW.
Such a quantum leap in development was made possible by an effective support mechanism, the Moj Prad program, which offered households a subsidy of up to PLN 5,000 (almost US$1,200) to purchase a solar power plant. This mechanism persuaded hundreds of thousands of Poles to spend money on home solar power plants.
In December, the Polish government made legislative changes that introduced a new algorithm for calculating electricity for households, which significantly increased the payback period of stations from five to six years to 10-11. But the war in Ukraine has forced Europe to rethink its energy strategy, giving renewable energy a vital role in the new model.
I think that Poland will also reconsider its attitude to the green generation. In March, Poland abandoned Russian coal and plans to ban the purchase of Russian gas and oil soon. So, I expect a new boom in renewable energy in Poland. This will happen in 2023. 
First, I urge European companies to continue to meet their contractual obligations to Ukrainian companies, which continue to operate and fulfil their responsibilities. This will be significant support for Ukrainians fighting on military and economic fronts.
It is essential to provide special conditions for lending and grants for Ukrainian companies that plan to develop green business in the European Union. It can also be programs that cover the participation of Ukrainians in exhibitions, conferences, and educational projects. Europe will only benefit from this because Ukrainian specialists are experienced high-class pros. Simplifying the conditions for Ukrainian companies to participate in various tenders in renewable energy can also be significant support from European partners.

Shell Overseas Investment has agreed to acquire 100% of Solenergi Power for $1.55 billion and, with it, the Sprng Energy group of companies. 
Established by Actis in 2017, Sprng has more than 2.9 GWp of assets in India (2.1 GWp operating and 0.8 GWp contracted) with a further 7.5 GWp of renewable energy projects in the pipeline. It supplies solar and wind power to electricity distribution companies in India. 
Shell has 1 GW of renewable generation capacity in operation globally. The acquisition of Sprng Energy’ solar and wind assets will triple its present renewable capacity in operation. 
The deal also positions Shell as one of the first movers in building a truly integrated energy transition business in India. In India, its gas business (Shell Energy) serves customers through a fully owned and integrated value chain. It has also invested in companies like Husk Power Systems and Cleantech Solar Pte. Ltd.
Wael Sawan, Shell’s Integrated Gas, Renewables and Energy Solutions Director, believes the acquisition will enable Shell to become a leader across the power value chain in a rapidly growing market where electrification and strong demand for renewables are driving the energy transition.
“Sprng Energy generates cash, has an excellent team, strong and proven development track record and a healthy growth pipeline. Sprng Energy’s strengths can combine with Shell India’s thriving customer-facing gas and downstream businesses to create even more opportunities for growth,” he said.
Sprng Energy will retain its existing brand and operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell within Shell’s Renewables and Energy Solutions Integrated Power business.

Tesla founder Elon Musk will avoid paying more than $2 billion in a shareholder lawsuit related to the acquisition of former top residential installer SolarCity.
“The Tesla board meaningfully vetted the acquisition, and Elon did not stand in its way,” said Delaware court Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights.
The suit alleged that Tesla’s purchase of major installer SolarCity was an attempt to bail out Musk’s cousin’s struggling company, of which Musk was the largest investor and chairman. The shareholders’ suit also accused Tesla’s board of having a lax approach to corporate governance.
Much of this lawsuit revolved around why SolarCity was purchased to begin with. Peter and Lyndon Rive founded SolarCity in 2006 with encouragement from their cousin, Musk. By the time Tesla purchased the company, Musk owned 22.2% and was chair of the board. Although it had grown to become the largest US installer in 2016, earning record revenues of $730 million, losses were mounting, with $820 million in net losses that year. The company had accumulated more than $1.5 billion in debt by the year of the purchase.
SolarCity’s business model relied on marketing, spending heavily on advertising and door-to-door sales, all while offering low-priced, long-term leases. Post-purchase, the strategy changed, as Tesla began to slash marketing costs, moving sales to direct-from-website and in-store sales. Musk noted in a 2019 deposition on the lawsuit that the door-to-door methods and other sales channel strategies did not match Tesla’s brand.
Musk said in the deposition that problems with the Tesla Model 3 caused the company to reassign much of its SolarCity workforce to bolster its vehicle production operations. He could not confirm exactly what portion of the workforce was reassigned. In his testimony, Musk argued that SolarCity could not have raised capital if it had not been acquired by Tesla. There is no doubt that Tesla’s shareholder value has increased impressively since the acquisition.
The development of Tesla’s solar roof program has taken things in a different direction than SolarCity’s model. SolarCity installed panels and equipment from top manufacturers and focused on getting customers signed to long-term leases. Tesla’s solar program now focuses on direct sales and uses proprietary solar tiles in their “solar roof” installations.
“Tesla continued to rely on other solar companies to manufacture, produce, install and sell parts of its solar products. In other words, the synergistic integration that Tesla hoped for is still a work in progress. Despite these challenges, Tesla’s value has massively increased following the Acquisition,” said Slights.
Tesla’s power division is now mostly focused on the home energy storage system, PowerWall. The product accounted for the largest portion of the power division’s $1.99 billion in revenue last year. Meanwhile, solar installations have fallen behind, with 205 MW installed in 2020, a fraction of the 803 MW SolarCity deployed in 2016. Recently, Tesla fell out of the top three ranking for residential solar installers, being squeezed out by Freedom Forever, a company that posted an impressive 80% installation volume growth in 2021.
Also included in the purchase of SolarCity was a US panel manufacturing plant in Buffalo, New York. Tesla aimed for a 1 GW a year of solar production, but its partner, Panasonic, has since walked away from the project. It is now unclear what volume of panels or roof tiles Tesla currently produces at the facility.
Musk’s victory means he avoided paying more than $2 billion in the shareholder suit – something that may be of relief as he attempts to buy social media platform Twitter for an estimated $44 billion.

Reactive Technologies is expanding into the United States, and has recently won recognition from BloombergNEF as one of its 2022 Pioneers. In late 2021, it connected their first unit to the UK grid. The company describes its technology as “sonar for the power grid”.
Reactive starts by installing a shipping container full of gear that sits behind an ultracapacitor. This grid-connected unit injects small, specific, bursts of energy – signals one might call them – into the power grid. The company listens to how the signals are distorted using in-house designed “measurement units” strategically located on the grid.
The company’s GridMetrix software suite then collects the distortion data and calculates the power grid’s system inertia, as well as other parameters. This information is then delivered to the grid operator’s management platforms so they can more discretely deploy grid supporting resources, and avoid turning on an entire coal plant to service a “tiny wobble” that could be fixed with a much smaller and faster battery.
The company connected their first unit to the grid in the United Kingdom to support National Grid in October 2021. In general, National Grid has been active in the budding “green inertia” space.
Grid stability is becoming a greater concern for operators in many markets as we transition into this brave new world. Recent events in California and Texas, which affected solar power generation heavily, bring this topic into even greater focus.
Solar-plus-storage has been running large off-grid solar power projects for decades, providing ample evidence that full size power grids could be run by the same technology.
Sonnen first made whole communities capable of going off-grid more than a decade ago in Europe, and in the United States since 2017. First Solar also proved its ability to provide grid-forming services from modules in 2017.  With ongoing inverter research, the full suite of solar gear (modules, inverters, and batteries) will be ready to run the grid very soon.
AEMO, the manager of Australia’s heavily renewable energy power grid, is investing significant time into solar inverters and batteries doing this work. The Philippines recently installed its first grid stability battery.
Keeping close to what we already understand, four “synchronous condensers” were installed on Australia’s grid, allowing for more than 1 GW of wind and solar to and avoid frequent curtailment, and to be almost fully utilized. These were the first units installed in the very advanced Australian renewables market.
Synchronous condensers are very large metal flywheels that spin at 50 or 60 revolutions per second, stabilizing the electromagnetic fields of the grid. These units are powered by electricity, rather than the steam from burning gas or coal. The hardware has been around for many decades, but is not needed on fossil heavy grids, since fossil generators already have spinning resources built in.
The large infrastructure investment company, Quinbrook, recently installed the first synchronous condenser in the UK. Additional units will be deployed at three more UK sites this summer.
This copy was amended on 04/05/22 to indicate synchronous condensers are flywheels that spin at 50 or 60 revolutions per second, not per minute, as previously stated.
